[time=90] [DING] Edwin Stanton was one of Lincoln's most severe critics
[time=117] and opponents. As a matter of fact, he constantly called Lincoln names like the original baboon
[time=123] and a big gorilla. One time Stanton said, "I don't know why anybody would go to Africa to see a gorilla.
[time=130] They can go to Springfield, Illinois and see Lincoln." Lincoln refused to come and or to strike back.
[time=138] He was patient. This went on for years as Lincoln would campaign for public office,
[time=144] being dubbed a clown, a gorilla and a baboon by Stanton.
[time=148] But when Abraham Lincoln was elected president, he named Edwin Stanton as the Secretary of War.
[time=156] One of his Lincoln's friends said, "Why on earth would you choose Stanton?" Again Lincoln refused to strike back.
[time=164] He said, "Because Stanton is the best man for the job." Four years later Lincoln was shot to death
[time=172] and a Stanton looked at the body of his president through his teary eye Stanton said,
[time=178] "Here is the greatest man who ever led human beings." Why? Because Lincoln refused to strike back.
[time=191] [MUSIC]
[time=196] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Oms. We're glad you joined us.
[time=200] Stay with us for an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship this Lord's Day.
[time=205] Today Rick is continuing his series on spiritual gifts with a message entitled, "Patience, Refusing to Strike Back," taken from First Corinthians.
[time=213] Love is one of the most misused words in our vocabulary.
[time=216] It is often used to describe how we feel about our family's and peach ice cream.
[time=221] Love often defies definition, but in First Corinthians 13, God describes love in 16 ways.
[time=228] The first description is that love is patient.
[time=230] It resists the temptation to strike back.
[time=233] Please locate your Bible and have it open to First Corinthians chapter 13 so that you can study with us.
[time=239] We will be looking at verses 4 through 8.
[time=241] The sanctuary choir will be singing the song entitled, "Purous Praise" from their new album.
[time=247] We will also be hearing from Kevin Rowe and Crystal Hall.
[time=252] The Bible Hour is an extension ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=261] We pray that the Lord will use this worship service to minister to you.
[time=265] Now, here's Pastor Rick.
[time=268] As well as those who are coming here today to worship with us, we trust that God will give to your heart a song of praise.
[time=275] Our choir sings a song of purest praise.
[time=282] [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=444] And we say thank you Lord for that privilege of bowing before Him and singing praises to His name.
[time=449] We'll continue doing that with you the congregation as we sing together, Him number 46.
[time=455] All praise thee, we praise thee, O God our Redeemer, Him number 46.
[time=461] [MUSIC - 97 seconds]
[time=563] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=566] You've been with us for the last several weeks.
[time=568] You'll notice that the registration card has an opportunity for you to indicate the areas in which you'd like to serve in our church on the back of that card.
[time=578] I want to especially emphasize the sanctuary choir are a very important part of our ministry at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=584] If you'd like to join the choir, you may just indicate that by making a check next to Sanctuary Choir on that card and we'll contact you.
[time=593] We'll be getting the fall kickoff on September 3rd and would love to have you with great voices that love to sing.
[time=599] Join us for that time.
[time=600] And the ministry that the choir has from week to week in our services.
[time=604] Now let's continue with our music as Kevin Rowe comes to sing to us a song entitled Higher Ground.
[time=611] (upbeat music)
[time=617] [MUSIC - 144 seconds]
[time=764] Well, we are certainly thankful to have the privilege
[time=772] of sharing the Bible hour with you today.
[time=775] Good morning, Pete, and how are you?
[time=777] Good morning, Rick.
[time=778] This week, we sent out our advanced bulletin, which is our special events calendar for the year, and it looks like we have a very eventful fall quarter.
[time=785] I'm looking forward to it.
[time=787] I think it begins even this Sunday night.
[time=789] Tonight is a very special night for us, and I would like to encourage any of you who may be watching today, but Black Hawk Baptist Church is your home to be with us tonight at six o'clock for evening service.
[time=801] I hope I have that time right.
[time=802] That's right.
[time=803] I've been planning on speaking at another church today for the last three months, and I called just to confirm the details, and they said I'd be a little bit early.
[time=812] It's the fourth Sunday of September that I'm supposed to be there.
[time=815] So I'm a little bit off on dates and times, but I am sure that tonight at six o'clock is our service that we're calling an evening of anticipation.
[time=824] By God's grace, we're endeavoring to build a new and larger sanctuary here at Black Hawk.
[time=830] That's going to take the effort of every one of us, and so tonight we're beginning a fall campaign of emphasis on what we'll need to do to build a new building.
[time=838] So if Black Hawk is your home, we want to encourage you and ask you to make every effort to be here with us tonight at six o'clock for an evening of anticipation.
[time=847] Some special music things are a part of that.
[time=849] Yes, Rick.
[time=850] The choir is going to do a special medley entitled "To God be the Glory." The quartet will be singing, and we'll just have a great time.
[time=857] Brian Lawson will be singing a solo and the message, and then the information concerning the beginning of our financial fundraising program will be a very informative night, as well as a good night for everyone to fellowship together.
[time=870] So please do make every effort to be with us tonight at six o'clock.
[time=875] Over the last few weeks, we've been speaking about spiritual gifts.
[time=879] We really haven't left that topic, because in the middle of all of that, Paul gives us a great lesson on love in chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians.
[time=887] But just this last week, we would like to offer to you the booklet entitled "Tongues." It's an excellent little booklet to help you understand what God's word has to say about spiritual gifts and this gift in particular.
[time=900] It comes to us from the author, Charles Swindall, and if you would like to have a copy, we would love to send it to you as a gift from us to you.
[time=909] Rick has just mentioned the book on tongues, and this will be the last week that we'll be offering this booklet.
[time=914] You can receive it today by writing to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=924] I do hope that you'll write for that booklet today and that you can grow through the study of God's word and the encouragement of fine Bible authors who are giving us insights and understanding into certain key passages of the Bible.
[time=938] Speaking of good Bible teaching, this week is the last week of the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=944] It's been a great summer.
[time=946] My own heart has been so encouraged as we've heard some fine teaching from God's word.
[time=951] Unfortunately, the summer is ending and that means the Summer Bible Conference is ending also.
[time=956] But we have one more week to go with the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=959] We've had some great pastors from other churches around the country come on a Thursday night and it really hasn't been a blessing to my heart too, Rick.
[time=967] And next Thursday night is no exception.
[time=970] Pastor Joel Stole will be with us.
[time=972] Pastor Joel Stole has pastor churches in Ohio, Indiana, and now Michigan, and God has used him in a great way because every time he has gone to a church, that church has seen many people come to Christ and has grown because the Word of God has been so faithfully and so excellently proclaimed.
[time=990] While our Summer Bible Conference ends this week, Thursday at 7 o'clock with Pastor Joel Stole, we want to invite you to join us for that.
[time=998] And of course, again, invite you for the service tonight at 6 o'clock.
[time=1002] Thank you for worshiping with us.
[time=1004] As we go back to our morning worship service, we're looking forward to the ministry of Crystal Hall.
[time=1010] As God has given her a gift of music, she now gives that same gift to us for our encouragement and our growth.
[time=1026] [MUSIC] In a time of trouble [MUSIC] In a time for old [MUSIC] There is a hiding place [MUSIC] Where hope is born [MUSIC] In a time of danger [MUSIC] When our faith is proved [MUSIC] There is a hiding place [MUSIC] Where we are loved [MUSIC] There is a hiding place [MUSIC] A strong, protected space [MUSIC] Where God provides the grace [MUSIC] To persevere [MUSIC] For nothing can remove us [MUSIC] From our fathers' love [MUSIC] Oh, may change [MUSIC] Yet nothing changes here [MUSIC] In a time of sorrow [MUSIC] In a time of grief [MUSIC] There is a hiding place [MUSIC] To give relief [MUSIC] In a time of weakness [MUSIC] In a time of fear [MUSIC] There is a hiding place [MUSIC] Where God is near [MUSIC] Precious hiding place [MUSIC] Precious hiding place [MUSIC] In the shelter of His love [MUSIC] Not a doubt or fear [MUSIC] Since my Lord is here [MUSIC] And I'm sheltered in His love [MUSIC] Yes, I'm sheltered in [MUSIC] His love â™ª
[time=1210] - Thank you, Crystal.
[time=1212] He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[time=1220] I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my strength, my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.
[time=1230] Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations before the mountains were born, or you brought forth the earth to the world from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[time=1246] God, thank you today that there is a shelter, that there is a hiding place.
[time=1252] We thank you for the beauty of a song, of an artist who would sing, but God, there's truth there that comes to us today as a point of rescue.
[time=1262] We thank you for your character, God, that you love us, that you shelter us under your wing.
[time=1270] Thank you, God, today, for the refuge and the fortress, the citadel, the rock and the cleft of the rock that the Lord Jesus is.
[time=1280] Thank you that there is higher ground than which we can plant our feet.
[time=1284] God, today, we give thanks.
[time=1288] And yet, God, we would also ask, we would pray today that you would be a hiding place for those whose hearts are broken.
[time=1296] We would pray today for those who've lost loved ones in recent days and weeks, that you would be to those families, a hiding place.
[time=1305] God, we would pray today that you would be to Lois Clancy, as she faces a kidney transplant to uncertainty as to whether the donor kidney will be adequate.
[time=1316] God, we would pray that today for Lois and Cecil and their family, you would be a hiding place.
[time=1322] God, we would pray today for Tonya Eastis and others who've gone through some very difficult valleys, that you would be a hiding place to her and to her family.
[time=1333] God, we would pray today that you would be a hiding place for those who battle cancer, like Harry Blossard and Catherine Northrop.
[time=1342] God, we pray today that you would be a hiding place for those who've faced hospitalization and surgeries like Brian and Phyllis this past week.
[time=1352] God, we would pray that in that hiding place there might be celebration of joy for the kisslers and the Elijah's and the birth of a grandchild.
[time=1362] God, we pray that in this hiding place of a Sunday morning service that you would be present, that you would direct our hearts and our thoughts to sing your praises, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1376] [AMEN] If you have your Bible, please open it to 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and study with us this morning what the Apostle Paul wrote as that great chapter on love, 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=1392] I would like to read for you today just four key verses, not even all four verses, but verses four, five, six and seven, and then just a little bit of verse eight.
[time=1403] The greatest definition of love that has ever been written.
[time=1407] Love is patient.
[time=1410] Love is kind.
[time=1412] It does not envy.
[time=1414] It does not boast.
[time=1416] It is not proud.
[time=1421] It is not self-seeking.
[time=1423] It is not easily angered.
[time=1426] It keeps no record of wrongs.
[time=1429] Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[time=1436] It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres, love never fails.
[time=1450] Love never fails.
[time=1454] This great description of love begins with the phrase "love is patient" or "love suffers long." Patience is that virtue that we most admire and the driver behind us but not in the driver in front of us.
[time=1467] Can you picture that situation?
[time=1469] You're sitting at a busy intersection.
[time=1471] You're in a big hurry.
[time=1472] You've got to get going.
[time=1475] The car in front of you has a driver that doesn't seem to have a care in the world.
[time=1480] They're just enjoying the weather.
[time=1482] They're even enjoying the traffic jam.
[time=1485] And as you look through their windshield you can see the traffic going by and you know there was a whole big enough they could have pulled out.
[time=1493] And you're talking to them.
[time=1494] They can't hear you but you're talking to them.
[time=1496] You're talking about them.
[time=1497] You're telling the people in the car about them and that dumb idiot, don't they know that's as big opening as you get in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1505] If you don't take it it won't come to tomorrow, buddy.
[time=1509] Yeah.
[time=1511] It's your turn.
[time=1513] You pull up.
[time=1514] It's your chance to pull out.
[time=1515] And you're looking and there's cars going every which way.
[time=1518] And the guy behind you decide your opening was big enough and he lets you know that.
[time=1522] He just gives a little bump on the horn, a little nod with the hat and you just say, "Hold your horses buddy, what's the big hurry?" Patience.
[time=1531] I admire it and the guy behind me a lot more than I do the guy in front of me.
[time=1536] Patience is probably one of the things that I would buy quickly if they sold it in the store.
[time=1543] Someone said a handful of patience is worth a bucket of brains.
[time=1551] That's really true.
[time=1553] We're not smart enough to be patient in most of our cases.
[time=1557] You know patience has sort of a rebound effect too.
[time=1560] Whenever we demonstrate patience we have the privilege by our patience of annoying the people who annoy us.
[time=1568] It just doesn't get to us.
[time=1570] And here the Apostle Paul begins with a description of love.
[time=1574] With the phrase love is patient.
[time=1578] Now in this description of love I think it's an important definition because we use love to describe anything and everything.
[time=1586] Someone may stand up and say, "I love my wife." Next guy may stand up and say, "I love peaches on my ice cream." Maybe the same guy.
[time=1596] What does love mean?
[time=1598] Is it just a word that we use to describe everything from ice cream to our mates?
[time=1603] It really is in our society.
[time=1605] Some use it to describe what we would call a commitment of life.
[time=1610] Others describe it simply as a good time at somebody else's expense.
[time=1615] Fifteen years ago Crosby stills Nash and Young saying a song.
[time=1620] The words went like this.
[time=1622] "Well, there's a rose in the fisted glove and the eagle flies with the dove." Honey, if you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with.
[time=1631] It's really a philosophy of life that says, "If you love this person but you can't be with that person, the least you can do is enjoy sex with somebody who's available." That's called making love. That's not love. That's lust.
[time=1644] What does the word love mean?
[time=1646] It really does resist definition.
[time=1649] But in this passage God has described love for us.
[time=1652] They give us insight to know how we are to order our lives if we really do love God
[time=1659] and we really do love people.
[time=1661] It's interesting that as we read this list to note that there are sixteen different phrases here.
[time=1667] Love is patient, love is kind, love does not envy.
[time=1670] There are sixteen of those little statements.
[time=1672] What's also interesting to note is every one of those statements is not love is followed by a noun or an adjective, they're actually verbs.
[time=1683] Now what's so significant about that?
[time=1685] Because if they're verbs, verb denote that action is taking place.
[time=1690] And here God is saying to us, love is not just words that we talk but love is actually the way that we order our lives, the way that we live, the way that we behave.
[time=1700] It's action. It's not passive.
[time=1703] It's actually definitive. It's aggressive in the better use of that word.
[time=1709] Sixteen verbs to describe how love behaves itself.
[time=1714] 1 John 3.18 says, "Let us not love in word or tongue.
[time=1721] But let us love indeed and truth.
[time=1725] Love behaves a certain way." And here are sixteen glimpses of how love behaves.
[time=1734] To be honest with you, as I began preparing for this study, I really thought that we would take one or maybe two weeks to go through these sixteen traits.
[time=1742] Kind of a lovers checklist, and we'll do that in the days ahead.
[time=1746] But as I began this study, I came to this first phrase that love is patient.
[time=1751] I need to confess to you that of all the gifts of the Spirit, and I had to list them in order of which one I possess, I don't know which one's first, but I do know which one's last.
[time=1762] Patience. I'm not a patient person.
[time=1766] And yet God says that if you're a person who would demonstrate love, then you would be a person who demonstrates patience.
[time=1773] God so spoke to me through this study of one word that today I want to share that with you.
[time=1778] I'm not sure that we'll take one Sunday for each of these sixteen, but today we'll spend one week here.
[time=1784] John Christosum said this, "Do not run past this description, beloved, but examine each point with care that you may know
[time=1795] and discern both the great riches of the subject and the great artistic skill."
[time=1802] God's given to us great insight here, and He's given it to us in a beautiful way, and we're encouraged by a man who would write in the fourth century not to race past this, but to take our time and to study it slowly.
[time=1814] Love is patience.
[time=1816] What is patience? What is it to be a patient person?
[time=1820] There are many words in the New Testament that describe what patience is.
[time=1824] This word is a unique word that is a compound of two others, and let me give you those two words.
[time=1830] The first is the word for macro.
[time=1832] We use the word macro in English to describe anything that is big or makes things bigger.
[time=1839] Macro means large or so large that it seems distant, and it means something that is big or far away, that the distance away is big.
[time=1850] The second word is the word fumio, which means to burn.
[time=1853] When you have a thermos, that is something that is designed to keep something hot, heat, thermo, fire.
[time=1861] That word means to burn with anger.
[time=1864] And now the person who is macro fumio is someone who is patient, is someone who they're anger, they're burning.
[time=1873] It's a far way off.
[time=1875] There are some of us who you just step on our toes emotionally, and our anger is right there. It's quick. It's now.
[time=1882] But the person who is patient is the person who that anger is far off.
[time=1888] It's distant.
[time=1889] It takes a long time, and the King James translates this well.
[time=1893] It says love suffers long.
[time=1897] It takes a long time before the person comes to the end of their rope and the beginning of their anger.
[time=1903] This word also is unique, not only in its grammatical construction, but in its usage.
[time=1909] There are many words that describe patience, but this word is used only and always to describe being patient with people.
[time=1918] Now, there's two types of us here today.
[time=1920] Some of us are very patient with things, and not with people.
[time=1925] Others of us are very patient with people, and not with things.
[time=1930] Some of us look at children, we see all the mess that they make, and we begin to grit our teeth, and those little rugrats get to us.
[time=1940] But we can be working on the most intricate machinery, and we can be very patient and dexterityous with that.
[time=1948] The other person, patients with all the children, the adult, they seem to have all the time in the world and they can do anything with people, but they stand with a monkey wrench in their hand and wave it at the car engine, threatening it of what they're going to do if that engine doesn't cooperate.
[time=1965] This word describes the ability to be patient with people, not to be patient with things.
[time=1973] Here God says that if your person is being controlled by love, then they are patient with people, they're slow to ever become angry.
[time=1984] Again, quoting from the 4th century in Christosum, this man was such a good speaker, he was called the golden tongue.
[time=1991] But to describe this word, patients, he writes, "It is a word used to describe a man who is wronged and who easily had it in his power to avenge himself, but never does it."
[time=2007] Listen to that again, there's two parts to it.
[time=2010] It's the person who has been wronged, they've been hurt, they've been mistreated, and within their power is the ability to avenge themselves.
[time=2019] It's not that there's not anything they can do about it, they can do something, they've been hurt, they've got power to retaliate, and yet they choose not to do that.
[time=2028] That is the patient person.
[time=2031] Now, that is what God says love is.
[time=2036] I've read this passage, I've heard this passage before, I had been exposed to this before I was a Christian, but you know that to the Greeks, this was a whole new concept.
[time=2048] Greek philosophy had been captured largely by three writers.
[time=2052] There were pre-socratic philosophers, but Socrates is considered the father of Greek philosophy.
[time=2059] He trained a student that we know as Plato.
[time=2063] Plato was the mentor of the next student by the name Aristotle.
[time=2067] Aristotle, more than any of the others, wrote on ethics.
[time=2070] His works are collected together in a book called Nicomachian Ethics.
[time=2075] In Nicomachian Ethics, Aristotle defines virtues.
[time=2080] What is a virtue and what is a vice?
[time=2083] According to Aristotle, a virtue was to not tolerate injustice, to avenge and to avenge quickly.
[time=2091] That was a virtue.
[time=2093] And a vice was to be passive and to tolerate and to not respond to injustice.
[time=2100] That's how the Greek mind worked.
[time=2102] That's how it was trained to think.
[time=2104] And suddenly Paul says love is patient.
[time=2111] It doesn't strike back.
[time=2113] It is slow to burn with anger.
[time=2117] Well, some of you are Greeks today.
[time=2120] Your instincts, your training, your thoughts say, strike back.
[time=2126] I for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
[time=2129] I don't get mad, I just get even.
[time=2131] And that's our heart.
[time=2134] Here the Bible says just the opposite.
[time=2136] Love is to be wronged, to have the power to avenge, to fold your hands, and refuse to do that very thing.
[time=2147] Wow.
[time=2148] That is a difficulty.
[time=2150] That is a challenge.
[time=2152] But you know as believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, we are first recipients of a patient love, and then we are to be demonstrators of that same love.
[time=2165] Keep your bulletin or your finger or something right here in first Corinthians.
[time=2169] But move with me if you will to Romans chapter 2.
[time=2173] Romans chapter 2 describes the very sinful nature of humanity.
[time=2178] St. Thomas Aquinas said man is not totally depraved.
[time=2181] By that he meant that not every part of us was depraved.
[time=2185] I believe the Bible teaches that we are depraved and we are totally depraved.
[time=2189] That doesn't mean I'm as sinful as I could possibly be, or that you are as sinful as you could possibly be.
[time=2195] By total depravity it means that every part of the human nature has fallen to sin.
[time=2200] That means your emotions, they're sinful.
[time=2203] My mind, it is sinful.
[time=2208] My appetites, they are sinful.
[time=2210] We are totally, every part of us has been marred and stained and twisted by sin.
[time=2216] That's what Romans chapters 1, 2, and 3 tell us.
[time=2219] We're bad.
[time=2220] We're in serious spiritual trouble.
[time=2223] But look at chapter 2 verse 4.
[time=2226] Or do you show contempt for the riches of his?
[time=2231] That's God.
[time=2233] Of his kindness.
[time=2235] Tolerance.
[time=2237] Patience.
[time=2238] Not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance.
[time=2245] Although we are marked by sin in every dimension of our life is so stained, God is still kind, still tolerant, still patient, still receiving of us.
[time=2258] Romans chapter 3, verse 23 says this.
[time=2263] For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[time=2268] That's the bad news.
[time=2270] The good news and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Jesus Christ.
[time=2278] God presented him as a sacrifice of entonement.
[time=2282] Through faith in his blood he did this to demonstrate his justice because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished.
[time=2294] He did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time so as to be just in the one who justifies the man who has faith in him.
[time=2302] That word forbearance is patience.
[time=2305] It's a different word.
[time=2307] It's actually a legal word.
[time=2309] Let me set it up like this please.
[time=2311] Suppose that I owe you a sizable amount of money.
[time=2314] Dick just supposed that I owed you $5,000.
[time=2317] I signed a promissory note and it was due today.
[time=2321] August the 24th and you came to me note and hand and said please pay that money and I said I don't have it.
[time=2331] Let's say I'm belligerent.
[time=2332] I said I don't have it and tough luck trying to get it.
[time=2335] You can stand in line at the courthouse if you want to and try to get what you can.
[time=2340] Now you've been wronged.
[time=2342] I owe you that money.
[time=2344] You have the legal right to demand that money or to take punitive steps.
[time=2349] But the word forbearance actually means to bear the problem for someone else and giving up your legal right to do that.
[time=2359] Thanks for that loan, Dick.
[time=2364] That's what God says I'm doing.
[time=2366] God says I have the legal right to punish you as guilty of sin but I'm willing to forbear it.
[time=2371] I'm willing to carry that longer and in Jesus Christ he died and not only forbore that sin but he paid for it himself.
[time=2383] About a hundred years ago there was a very, very famous, famous atheist by the name of Robert Ingersoll.
[time=2390] In Ingersoll went from town to town like a traveling evangelist only not proclaiming salvation in Christ but denouncing anyone who would believe in God.
[time=2400] Ingersoll was famous for his speeches and in his speeches he was famous for making this statement.
[time=2406] He would say if there's a God in heaven that has power then strike me dead in five minutes if everything I've said isn't the truth.
[time=2417] Wow, that's pretty intense stuff.
[time=2420] He would stand there on the stage mocking the concept of believing in God and calling God to strike him dead in five minutes.
[time=2428] He had a little antique that he would pull and he would look to somebody in the audience and he'd say what time is it Jim?
[time=2433] What time is it Jim?
[time=2437] 1138 if God doesn't strike me dead by 1143, quick math, then that proves there is no God and he would tell jokes at the expense of God and it would come 1143 and Robert Ingersoll was still there.
[time=2457] God didn't zap him. There was no lightning and he's nearly pointed out that there was no God.
[time=2465] This went on in town to town, town to town until we met a man but named a Theodore Parker who followed his speech.
[time=2472] Theodore Parker just humbly said speaking of Ingersoll did the gentleman really think that he could exhaust the patience of an eternally loving God in just five minutes.
[time=2484] I love a death so true. He is so patient. He is so kind. He gives more than five minutes.
[time=2492] 2 Peter 3.9 says that he's patient because it's not his will.
[time=2497] It's not his first desire that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.
[time=2503] But you know Robert Ingersoll wasn't the only man to try God's patience.
[time=2507] Every one of us in this auditorium consistently tries the patience of God.
[time=2513] Some of you are discovering that God is patient and you're even taking advantage of that.
[time=2519] Some of you have chosen to live your life in sexual immorality and yet today you would keep that a secret from this body
[time=2527] and you would come and say by your demeanor and conduct everything's fine trying the patience of God.
[time=2535] Others would say my life sure I believe in God but you've ordered your life around materialism or personal pleasure.
[time=2544] You're trying the patience of God.
[time=2547] Oh beloved today let us be thankful that he gives more than five minutes that he gives grace.
[time=2552] But let us never be those who take advantage of his grace.
[time=2557] God's given us patience. He has suffered long with us but now he expects us to suffer long.
[time=2566] The Bible says and this is Jesus' own words.
[time=2569] If someone mistreats you, if someone insults you, if someone takes their insult to public demonstration and insults you
[time=2578] and slaps you on the face a formal challenge to your manliness and your character.
[time=2584] And he says bear that insult and if he chooses to insult you again with a second slap give him a fresh cheat to slap.
[time=2592] Paul said in Romans chapter 12 see to it that none of us render evil for evil.
[time=2600] That's being patient. That's suffering long.
[time=2604] You see what the Bible says is if Christ is in our heart then the love of God is shed in our heart.
[time=2611] That's Romans chapter 5 verse 1 and 2.
[time=2614] The love of God is shed in our heart. That becomes a new reservoir.
[time=2618] So often we're looking at someone who has hurt us.
[time=2621] They've mistreated us. They've abused us.
[time=2623] And we say I don't have any more to give them.
[time=2626] None of us have any more to give in those circumstances of ourselves.
[time=2630] But God says I will shed my love abroad in your hearts.
[time=2634] I'll give you a new resource. I'll dig the well from which you can draw.
[time=2639] Someone says if you do that you'll just be taken.
[time=2645] People will take you.
[time=2647] That's right. People will take you.
[time=2651] They took the Lord Jesus to a cross.
[time=2656] And then they took that cross to a mountain called Calvary.
[time=2660] And then they took that man and they nailed him to a cross.
[time=2663] And then they took that cross and they lifted it up and they dropped it into a hole so that the very flesh would rip from the bones.
[time=2670] He was taken.
[time=2673] And that man who was taken said father forgive them.
[time=2680] They don't know what they're doing.
[time=2683] Yes, you'll be taken.
[time=2684] Stephen was taken by an angry mob to what really amounted to a bowl shaped curvature on the earth made out of stones.
[time=2692] And they bound him and they threw him down the hill into that hollow of the ground and then they picked up stones.
[time=2699] And they took him and they took stones and they threw and one would miss but another would hit an arm.
[time=2704] And then the head and his body would be being pummeled by rocks and yes he was taken.
[time=2710] He said God forgive them.
[time=2715] How could he do that?
[time=2718] Stephen could not do that but the Christ who lived in Stephen could.
[time=2727] You cannot continue to love your husband but the Christ in you can continue to love him through you.
[time=2736] Some of you cannot continue to love your unfaithful wife but the Christ in you can love her through you.
[time=2744] Some of you cannot continue to love your parents but Christ in you can continue to love them through you.
[time=2752] You see there are two natures within each of us.
[time=2756] And if we only live and respond out of the old nature well I've never had the capacity to love her to be kind.
[time=2762] But if we live out of the new nature Christ in us there is unlimited resources.
[time=2768] Please don't misunderstand I didn't say that this was easy I didn't say that it came natural.
[time=2773] I didn't mean to imply that it doesn't hurt nails and Christ hands hurt stones and Peter's face killed him.
[time=2780] But there's a reservoir that we can draw upon.
[time=2786] There's a form of counseling that is certainly not adequate in every situation but maybe one of the best places to start.
[time=2793] It's called bibliotherapy.
[time=2795] It's simply the therapy of reading to the troubled patient appropriate biblical verses.
[time=2801] No that isn't going to cure paranoia.
[time=2804] No it isn't going to change sexual infidelity.
[time=2807] No it's not going to change the man who's manic depressive but for most of us.
[time=2812] 94% of all people who need counseling are not coming because of some organic or congenital condition that needs medication or hospitalization.
[time=2822] 94% of us need right thinking.
[time=2826] Bibliotherapy can be a great help.
[time=2829] Let me do it with you today.
[time=2831] We're going to do it in mass with five or six hundred of us right now.
[time=2835] If you're struggling today with someone who's wronged you and wronged you greatly.
[time=2840] Perhaps they've broken your trust.
[time=2842] Perhaps they've taken financial opportunity at your expense.
[time=2845] Perhaps they've ruined your testimony and your character to everyone that you hold dear.
[time=2850] Each of us have those events in our life.
[time=2854] And our lives are like videotape recorders.
[time=2856] You don't need to go out and buy one.
[time=2858] You've got one.
[time=2859] It's called a mind.
[time=2860] As soon as you think of that person as though somebody hit the rewind button and the tape just replays exactly what happened years ago.
[time=2866] And it's as fresh as the very day we saw it for the first time.
[time=2869] Let me ask you to do that right now.
[time=2872] Go ahead and hit the rewind button.
[time=2875] Be able to focus on that person who has broken your trust.
[time=2879] Take an advantage of you.
[time=2881] Caused you to lose a part of your livelihood.
[time=2886] Many of us are responding right now with some fumeus, some anger, some fire.
[time=2892] Well, if it helps you to concentrate you might even close your eyes.
[time=2895] But now as you think about that person, please listen to what God's word says.
[time=2901] A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.
[time=2914] A hot-tempered man stirs up dissension, but a patient man calms a quarrel.
[time=2927] Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper more than a man who takes a city.
[time=2939] But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, kindness, long suffering.
[time=2956] Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[time=2971] Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.
[time=2978] Forgive as the Lord forgave you, and over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[time=2993] Be completely humble, gentle, be patient, bearing with one another in love, make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace.
[time=3010] See to it that none of you render evil for evil. If a man strike you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[time=3025] Father forgive them, they know not what they do. Some of you are no takers, let me just quickly list some of those references for you.
[time=3035] If you are like me, you struggle with patience. You are soon to burn with anger.
[time=3042] I'm going to take the challenge and want to pass it on to you to read these verses daily until we sense God working in our life to change those characteristics of being a fast burner.
[time=3055] Here are the verses I read for you. Proverbs 15-1, Luke, or excuse me, Proverbs 15-18, and Proverbs 16-32, Galatians 5-22, Colossians 3, 12, and 13, Ephesians 4-2, Matthew 5-39, Romans 12-17.
[time=3084] You see, each of us has two natures. An old nature, new nature. And our old nature says, respond quick, avenge fast, don't get mad, get even.
[time=3098] The new nature says, forgive, be patient. Which wins, whichever one we feed. You remember the poem, don't you?
[time=3110] Two natures beat within my chest, the one is cursed, the other blessed, the one I love, the other I hate, the one I feed will dominate.
[time=3119] If I'm going to become a more patient man, it's going to come through feeding myself the bibliotherapy of what does God say ought to be the right response.
[time=3127] Not what this Hollywood say. Not what would Magnum P.I. do. What would the Lord Jesus do?
[time=3136] Let me be a little kinder. Let me be a little blinder. To the faults of those about me, let me praise a little more.
[time=3146] Let me be when I am weary, just a little bit more cheery. Let me serve a little better those that I am striving for.
[time=3155] Let me be a little braver when temptation bids me waiver. Let me strive a little harder to be all that I should be.
[time=3164] Let me be a little meaker. Make my life with a brother that's weaker. Let me think more of my neighbor and a little less of me.
[time=3177] Let me be a little sweeter, make my life a bit completer. Keep me faithful to my duty every minute of the day.
[time=3185] Let me toil without complaining not a humble task disdaining. Let me face the summons calmly when death beckons me away.
[time=3198] Let me be a little kinder.
[time=3202] If God's love is in our heart, then it becomes that new hope, that new resource from which we can draw strength in our life today.
[time=3210] God says that He will fill us, that He will give us the strength and the ability to bear and not only to bear, but to forebear.
[time=3222] Abraham Lincoln was the blunt of much criticism, public ridicule.
[time=3229] Probably no one was more severe and insensitive than a man by the name of Edwin Stanton.
[time=3237] Stanton called him the "babbling baboon" and the original gorilla.
[time=3243] Stanton once said, "Why should anybody go to Africa to see a gorilla while there's one living in Springfield, Illinois?"
[time=3252] And that type of heckling came from Stanton again and again and again.
[time=3257] Quite often it was a part of a debate between the two men, but Abraham Lincoln refused to retaliate.
[time=3263] He resisted the urge to strike back.
[time=3267] Years went on and the heckling went on.
[time=3270] Cartoons were drawn of Lincoln and labeled the baboon and the gorilla.
[time=3277] But in 1860 Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States.
[time=3282] He sat down to design a cabinet and he named Edwin Stanton to the prestigious position of Secretary of War.
[time=3292] Lincoln's friends shuttered, they thought, and they said, "Why Stanton of all people?
[time=3298] Don't you remember he called you the baboon and the gorilla?" Again Lincoln refused to strike back.
[time=3306] He simply said, "Stanton is the best man for that job."
[time=3312] While Stanton was Secretary of War he continued to criticize Lincoln at his every move.
[time=3321] He constantly complained about the President's decision.
[time=3324] He undermined the members of the rest of the cabinet.
[time=3328] Lincoln refused to criticize.
[time=3333] On April the 14th, 1865 Abraham Lincoln was shot.
[time=3340] His body was moved to a boarding house across the street.
[time=3343] In the wee hours of April the 15th, 1865 Abraham Lincoln died.
[time=3350] Stanton was at his side.
[time=3353] Through his tears Edwin Stanton said, "Their lies, the greatest ruler of men who has ever lived."
[time=3366] Lincoln was a great man and one of the things that made him great was that he was patient, that he refused to strike back.
[time=3378] I don't know how to measure love in every circumstance or in every way.
[time=3383] But by God's word I know today that if I say I love my wife, I'll be patient with her.
[time=3391] If I say that I love my children, I'll be patient with them.
[time=3396] If I say that I love this church, I'll be patient with this body.
[time=3404] Who is it that you say you love today?
[time=3407] Can it be measured by your patients?
[time=3410] Can it be measured by the fact that it takes a long time for you to burn before the anger gets hot?
[time=3419] Lord, make me a little kinder.
[time=3423] Lord, make me a little blinder to the faults of those around me.
[time=3428] Lord, make me to praise.
[time=3431] God, today we bow before you.
[time=3434] We want to thank you for your long suffering.
[time=3437] You've not, today, dealt with us according to our sins.
[time=3443] God, we would pray today first and foremost for those men and women who've never given their heart to Christ,
[time=3449] that today they might see the patience of God and stop testing it and surrender to Christ.
[time=3456] Father, today we would pray as believers in Christ, "I'm praying for me." By your grace, I'll live out of the resources of your spirit and that you'll make me patient with two little girls and a little boy.
[time=3469] God, make me slow to burn with a body of people who may respond differently than I would choose.
[time=3479] God, thank you for a loving wife who is patient with me.
[time=3482] May I return her kindness.
[time=3485] God, make us patient with those who have misused our trust, with those who have wasted our resources.
[time=3493] God, help us to love in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3499] If you've given your heart to Christ, if you've never done that, would you do that right now?
[time=3506] Would you give your life to Jesus Christ and surrender to him?
[time=3515] [MUSIC]
[time=3525] We've been sharing with you the special music from our church musicians of the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3532] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3537] Just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3540] Will you pray this prayer with me?
[time=3543] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3551] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3556] I ask you to come in today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3563] We are always happy to hear of such a decision.
[time=3565] If you've made that decision today, will you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3570] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3578] To receive a copy of "Your Decision" or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Tons" by Charles Windall, please write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
