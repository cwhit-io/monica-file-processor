[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] - Love does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. Love refuses to care. Who gets the credit? Who takes home the glory?
[time=110] Two ducks and one little frog shared the same pond. But as the summer got hotter and hotter and the air was drier and drier,
[time=118] the water was evaporating and the pond was shrinking smaller and smaller. The frog and the ducks began to talk because they realized their pond was soon to be gone.
[time=129] That was no problem for the ducks. They would just fly on to the next pond. But what about their little friend, the frog?
[time=135] Well, the frog had an idea. He said to his two friends, the ducks, if you'll put a stick in your bill and you'll put the other end in your bill,
[time=142] there'll be a little bar going between your mouths and I can put my mouth on the stick and I can hold on, and when you fly to the other pond, you can just carry me.
[time=151] Well, sure enough, they tried that very plan and it worked. The ducks began to flap their wings and take off. The frog had a good grip with his jaws,
[time=159] and they made their lift off and they were soaring over the field. The two ducks carrying the frog on the stick.
[time=165] And a farmer looked up and saw that site, first laughed and said, "That's ingenious. Who thought of that idea?" And the frog said, "I did." Boom.
[time=175] Love refuses to care. Who gets the glory?
[time=195] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=205] Today, Rick's message is entitled, "Love is Not Proud" and is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=211] As we continue to study through 1 Corinthians 13, the great love chapter of the Bible, we will discover four more qualities of love.
[time=220] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 13, where we'll be looking at verses 4 through 8.
[time=229] Special music for today's service will be provided by the sanctuary choir, Kathy Hawks and Peter Coby.
[time=240] The Bible Hour is an extension ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and is telecast on this station each week at this time.
[time=249] We pray that the Lord will use this worship service to minister to use. Now here's Rick.
[time=256] But our friends who join us for the Bible Hour, welcome today. On this Labor Day weekend, we take a rest from our labor, but let us never forget that God has created us to work.
[time=267] Not only to work in serving him, but in the garden before sin, he said, "Where to work?" And so today, we're privileged to work and privileged to have a day of rest from that work.
[time=278] Thank you for worshiping with us. The choir now sings a song that talks about a faith that stands through the trials and the testing of life.
[time=297] [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=532] - What a privilege to know a savior, Lord and King of our lives,
[time=546] and then to claim to the faith that he holds on to us in all of our experiences and daily life.
[time=553] Let's continue now singing together, take the name of Jesus with you, Him number 705.
[time=559] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=564] [MUSIC - 124 seconds]
[time=698] Thank you very much for participating with us in our singing.
[time=702] Last week we mentioned the registration card and the opportunity for service in our church.
[time=708] We mentioned the sanctuary choir beginning this Wednesday, September 3rd.
[time=712] If you'd like to be a part of the choir, please check the registration card and we'll get in contact with you.
[time=718] Join us this Wednesday evening to tell you the obligations that you have concerning work in the sanctuary choir.
[time=725] Let's continue with music now as we listen to Kathy Hawks as she ministers to us.
[time=742] [MUSIC - 178 seconds]
[time=933] (orchestral music)
[time=943] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=949] Pete, these are exciting days in the life of our church as we anticipate a new home for our church and for the television ministry.
[time=956] For many months now, Rick, we've been talking about the building of our new church sanctuary and the wheels are rolling.
[time=963] We have a lot of planning meetings and just some excitement is permeating the air as the fall season rolls around.
[time=969] Well, God has certainly blessed our ministry here in Fort Wayne, and we are so thankful that he has chosen to do that.
[time=976] And more than anything else, we want him to get all the praise for whatever is being done.
[time=981] Our church is planning on building a new sanctuary right here on State Street, but on our property that is directly across the street from this building.
[time=989] We're hoping to build a sanctuary that will seat somewhere between 1,800 and 2,100 people.
[time=995] We're still in that design phase, and I'm not sure that designing buildings is a lot of fun.
[time=1000] We've been a lot of meetings, Rick, late at night and early in the morning, but I think when we begin to see the earth being moved over there and some of that activity, it'll begin to get really exciting.
[time=1011] We would like to ask you to be praying for us that God would truly direct our planning and our thinking and every step of the design of this building, and of course, be praying that God, if it's his will for us to build this building, would provide the finances that will be needed.
[time=1026] The total project will be somewhere between 3 and 4 million dollars, and that obviously is a large financial commitment, but we know that our God is able, and if he wants us to build, then he will provide it here.
[time=1038] So I'm looking forward to that, and I know you are too.
[time=1041] Rick, we already had a meeting last Sunday night that got the fundraising campaign kicked off, and I just felt like there was a tremendous spirit among our fellowship here, and we just hope that our viewers will just pray along with us that God will keep the unity of the body here as we go through this tremendous program.
[time=1059] And that, Pete, is exactly my prayer request that God would keep the unity of the body here, that we would keep our focus on ministry and not on building buildings.
[time=1069] Our ministry is obviously first and foremost a ministry of God's Word proclaiming the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1075] I know in a few moments you are going to sing a beautiful song that proclaims the love of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1081] That song is called "Broken and Spilled Out", and I think that's our desire just to let our hearts be used as God wants them to be used.
[time=1088] We've had some tremendous messages even this summer as it relates to our summer Bible conference that has helped me tremendously in my spiritual walk with God.
[time=1097] You know, they've done the exact same thing for me.
[time=1099] I love to study God's Word, and I certainly can grow by reading God's Word, and that's primary, but there's also a great opportunity to hear God's Word proclaimed, and that's certainly been mine.
[time=1111] These last two or three weeks have just been...
[time=1113] They have been, and we're sorry to say the summer Bible conference is over because it's been such a time of spiritual enrichment for all of us here.
[time=1123] But this week starts our regular fall program, and we've got three children's choirs, a program for children called Whirly Birds, Jet Cadets, and Space Cubs.
[time=1132] For the adults, there's choir, and a Bible study for men, and a separate Bible study for women, and a training program to learn to share our faith, so that's equally as exciting, and we're looking forward to that as well.
[time=1143] Many of the people will be back and very active in teaching classes and involved in the choir program, and it's going to be a good time September 3rd when we get together for the first time for our fall program.
[time=1154] Well, I'm looking forward to it.
[time=1156] It's going to be growing whether you're a part of a church service, or whether you're located as many of our missionary friends are completely in a different continent.
[time=1166] You can still be growing because it is God's Word and His Spirit that produces growth.
[time=1172] And you need to be growing apart from your church or this telecast.
[time=1176] Each of us in our private worlds must be reading God's Word.
[time=1180] But that's not an easy habit to begin, nor is it an easy endeavor to take upon ourselves.
[time=1185] But we have a helpful little tool that I know can make the difference.
[time=1188] It's called Timeless Insights, and it's produced by our friends down at Walk Through the Bible Ministries in Atlanta, Georgia.
[time=1195] Bruce Wilkinson spoke here this summer and stirred our hearts.
[time=1198] Well, this tool comes from his office as a way of encouraging us day by day to be studying God's Word.
[time=1205] It begins by encouraging us to read through the New Testament in one year, selecting a timely way of moving through the New Testament.
[time=1213] Then after we read the selected portion for that day, we get what we call a timeless insight.
[time=1218] An insight from some great Bible teacher, someone like John Calvin or Martin Luther or Matthew Henry, and then most importantly to me as a timely response, a way that we can respond to what we've read.
[time=1231] We'd like to send you a copy today.
[time=1233] If you'll simply ask for it, we'll send it.
[time=1236] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1246] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1251] Zip code is 46815.
[time=1254] Now, Pete is going to prepare our hearts to study God's Word by singing a song that's entitled "Broken and Spilled Out." Before he ministers to us in song today, I would like to encourage you, if you're available, to join us tonight at 6 o'clock for the last in the film series with James Dobson on turning our hearts towards home.
[time=1277] This film series has been five film series long, and tonight is the last.
[time=1282] And it is an excellent series of strengthening our faith and commitment to the Lord and then to our families.
[time=1288] If you're available, or if what you're doing is something that you can change, I would encourage you to come tonight and have this vital ministry input into your life.
[time=1300] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1302] I trust that you've got your Bible open, and more than that, you're hard open for God to speak through us through song and His Word today.

[time=1621] Lord Jesus, today we come to meet under the shadow of that cross
[time=1629] in which you were broken.
[time=1632] We come to reflect on our lives for which you were spilled out.
[time=1638] God, today we are humbled and we are broken.
[time=1643] God, in your love and in your wisdom, you've chosen to break us.
[time=1649] Many of us today, God, sense that we're in the crucible of life.
[time=1654] And our very life is being broken.
[time=1658] And the flow of joy is being ground in with the powder of bitterness.
[time=1663] And so today, God, we've come to this point and this place to find refuge.
[time=1670] And to come and to find that the life of the Lord Jesus that was broken is also spilled out into a healing ointment.
[time=1679] God, today we pray for those broken lives that you might bring healing.
[time=1685] Father, we pray for that one today who has gone through deep rejection.
[time=1692] As a spouse has betrayed them, one who has said that I will love you for better
[time=1699] or for worse, for richer, for poorer.
[time=1704] And sickness and health till death to us part has now parted.
[time=1709] And it wasn't death.
[time=1712] Oh, God, the brokenness of that heart today we would pray that you could mend.
[time=1719] God, we pray today for those who are broken.
[time=1723] They've loved their children and they've been the pride of their life as a little lad, as a young girl. But now through adolescence and adulthood,
[time=1734] there's been great spiritual warfare and appearances broken today.
[time=1740] Oh, God, would you give comfort to that heart of a mother or a father who is still praying
[time=1746] for a rebellious offspring?
[time=1750] God, we would pray today for those who have found that in life they've been broken again
[time=1757] and again, to give to them that fruit of the spirit of patience, the ability to refuse to strike back.
[time=1766] God, through your word, we would pray that there would not only come healing, but there would come energy and vitality, that though our lives be broken, that there is a spiritual reservoir that spring up joy and hope eternal.
[time=1782] Oh, God, today through your word, we would pray that you would fortify us and give us the strength that in the face of temptation, we would stand with a faith that is rooted in Jesus Christ.
[time=1796] For it is in His name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1801] 1 Corinthians chapter 13, as we continue our study through this, passage that chapter 13 is often called the love chapter of the Bible.
[time=1812] It is a part of a lengthy passage 12, 13, and 14 about spiritual gifts,
[time=1818] which of course is a part of 1 Corinthians that teaches us about order and priorities in the church. 1 Corinthians chapter 13,
[time=1829] and verses 4 through part of 8.
[time=1832] Love is patient.
[time=1835] Love is kind.
[time=1838] It does not envy. It does not boast.
[time=1843] It is not proud.
[time=1848] It is not self-seeking.
[time=1851] It is not easily angered.
[time=1854] It keeps no record of wrongs.
[time=1859] Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
[time=1867] It always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
[time=1878] always perseveres.
[time=1882] Love never fails.
[time=1888] 1 Corinthians 13, the great chapter on love, begins to describe love that never fails.
[time=1895] Part of that quality of love is that it is never boastful and it is never proud.
[time=1900] It does not care who gets the attention to whom the glory is delivered.
[time=1905] There were two ducks and one frog that shared the same small little pond.
[time=1912] They played together and did whatever frogs and ducks do together.
[time=1916] But as the summer grew long and the rains grew slight, evaporation took place and their pond was shrinking very quickly.
[time=1926] And they had discovered that it was only a matter of days before their pond would be completely gone.
[time=1932] For the ducks, that was no problem.
[time=1934] They would simply fly to the next pond, but for the frog, that was a serious dilemma.
[time=1939] And so the three of them, the two ducks in the frog, began to talk about all of their possibilities and they were really in trouble.
[time=1947] But the frog came up with an idea.
[time=1949] He said to his two friends, the ducks, if you got a stick about this long.
[time=1953] And if each of you put a piece of the stick into your bill and held it just like this and flew away,
[time=1960] I could grab ahold of the stick in the middle with my mouth and you could carry me to the next pond.
[time=1966] Well, they thought that was a pretty good idea.
[time=1968] So one of the ducks took off. He came back with a stick just about this long and he held it very rigid in his bill.
[time=1974] And the other duck grabbed it in his bill and there was like a little bar and the frog hopped up,
[time=1980] grabbed it with his mouth and hauled onto that stick for dear life.
[time=1987] The ducks began to flap their wing and it wasn't the smoothest take off, but they made it.
[time=1991] The stick in their mouth, the frog dangling by his mouth, swinging back and forth in the middle, and they just made it over that first row of corn.
[time=1999] They no longer got airborne than they went right over the farmer's head and the farmer looked up and began to laugh.
[time=2007] But then he said, "Well, that's ingenious. I wonder who thought of that idea." And the frog said, "I did." Love isn't proud. It doesn't care who gets the glory.
[time=2020] Love isn't boastful. It doesn't say, "I did." Look what I've accomplished.
[time=2025] The Apostle Paul begins to describe for us a love that's far beyond my ability to begin to produce.
[time=2034] Love is patient. It's kind. It's humble rather than proud or arrogant.
[time=2040] It always perseveres. It always endures. It always trusts.
[time=2047] And on a scale of one to ten, I failed to move the needle.
[time=2053] And yet God said, "That's the love that I have for you, and I want to shed it in your heart abroad.
[time=2059] I want to give it overflowing that you can be a dispenser of my love." Last week we looked at love is patient.
[time=2067] It has as its companion love is kind. There are about six places in the New Testament where patience and kindness go together.
[time=2074] Now I know that all of you who were here last week thoroughly remember everything we said about patience, but there's a few visitors today so for their sake we'll review.
[time=2083] The word patience is a word that means to be slow, distant, in our fire, our anger.
[time=2095] It is the idea of being struck but refusing to strike back.
[time=2102] It is someone who suffers long. King James puts it well there with other people.
[time=2109] Now kindness is a companion to that.
[time=2114] John MacArthur writing on this passage says, "Patience is the quality of being mistreated and being taken by others,
[time=2126] and kindness is the ability to turn around and to treat them kindly."
[time=2134] Where one is a mistreatment, the other is a loving treatment in response.
[time=2141] I've got a confession to make.
[time=2144] I was in conversation by way of telephone with another organization with whom we trade, we share resources
[time=2152] for their betterment and we give them ours and for our betterment they share some of their things with us.
[time=2159] Over the last few months they had begun to hint that they weren't going to be in a position where they could share their resources with us, but also began to hint that they sure did need our resources.
[time=2171] Kind of that old line, what's yours is ours and what's mine's mine.
[time=2178] And I was driving on my way to the library deciding how was I going to handle this and I thought of all the things that I was going to tell those people.
[time=2187] But then Proverbs 15-1 came to mind that said, "A soft answer turns away wrath, grievous words stir up anger, and I was convinced that God was saying to me as he should have been, always be gracious."
[time=2201] And so I had determined that no matter how this phone call went, my first response was going to be gracious and kind and understanding.
[time=2211] And then I decided if that doesn't work, then I'll give them the ultimatum.
[time=2220] Your equipment, facilities unavailable to us, ours aren't either.
[time=2226] And see how the heat works on them just a little bit.
[time=2229] So that's what I decided. I'm on my way to the library to finishing up some study and I've already decided.
[time=2236] Point one is I'm going to be gracious. Point two, if that doesn't work, that's when you give it to them.
[time=2242] I open up my Bible and I read all this stuff.
[time=2245] Love is patient. Love is kind. I've studied all that. I've done all the word studies.
[time=2249] Well, I'll just check some other commentaries and I open up John MacArthur and it says, "Patience is the ability that will be taken advantage of by others,
[time=2261] and kindness will in turn give them anything they need." I said, "Oh man, that's not fair." Isn't it amazing how God can take his word and bring it right down to where you live?
[time=2276] As we go through these qualities, I believe what God wants me to do and what God wants you to do
[time=2282] is not simply to write down their patience, compound to Greek words, macroming a far through me to burn, to burn from afar. That's good information.
[time=2292] Now what's next? I believe God wants it to get inside us and to change how we live and how we think.
[time=2304] That's not easy, isn't it? But yet the Bible says God has given us his word not simply to increase our knowledge.
[time=2311] But to change our lives. God says, "I want you to respond to people not in kind,
[time=2319] the kind that they give to you, but in kindness to them." And the root word of the word kindness actually means to be useful.
[time=2328] I believe that there are two verses that go together with this perfectly out of the Sermon in the Mount.
[time=2334] Turn if you will back to Matthew chapter 5 and verse 38 to Jesus' famous statements about kindness and mistreatment.
[time=2344] Verse 38 says, "You have heard that it was said, and I, for an eye, tooth for tooth.
[time=2355] But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
[time=2360] If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."
[time=2366] Now that's patience. That's that ability that says my instincts are to burn, but I'll be slow.
[time=2375] And when I am mistreated, I will refuse to strike back. Now look at the next two verses.
[time=2383] And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let them have your cloak also.
[time=2389] If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him too.
[time=2397] What it is saying is be patient, be slow to be angry, and then with that person who's taxing your patience,
[time=2404] turn around and do whatever you can that's going to be useful and helpful to them.
[time=2408] Don't treat them in the kind of treatment they give you, but treat them in kindness as God has treated us.
[time=2415] Jonathan Swift who was famous for his writing of Gulliver's Travels elsewhere said,
[time=2421] "We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love."
[time=2429] You know, and if Jesus Christ comes into our life, that's not religion, that's a relationship.
[time=2435] And that gives us the ability not to simply love back out of our own resources, but the love back out of his.
[time=2442] I'm discovering every day that there's more and more available to me, but there's more and more required of me.
[time=2450] Love is patient. Love is kind.
[time=2458] Then he changes to a new concept. As he's unfolding as if it were a yardstick by which we measure love, he then says,
[time=2465] "Love does not envy." That word envy is like the word patient in that it has some heat to it.
[time=2475] The word envy means to boil or to boil over.
[time=2479] It's a neutral word. It doesn't necessarily connote to be boiling over in the wrong sense any more than the right sense.
[time=2487] In chapter 12 verse 31, it says, "Eagerly desire." That's the same word.
[time=2491] Be envious of the better spiritual gifts being demonstrated in your fellowship.
[time=2497] But there can be a boiling over which says, "I'm not only desiring it for everybody's good, but I want it for me."
[time=2508] In the concept of English, we have two separate words, jealousy and envy. The same word is used here.
[time=2515] Envy says, "I see what you've got, and I want it."
[time=2521] Boy, I like your office. I like your job. I like your house, and I like your car.
[time=2528] I like your boat, and I like your skis. I like your condominium. I like your accessories.
[time=2535] I want it all. Whether you have it, I want it.
[time=2540] Someone said there are two classes of people, those who are millionaires and those who wish they were millionaires.
[time=2546] That's that envious spirit that always wants.
[time=2550] But jealousy takes it a step further and says, "I'm not only wanting what you have, but I'm angered that I don't have it, and you do."
[time=2560] There's not anything worse than doing very poorly on a test in school and looking at your paper like this.
[time=2575] And discovering that they did really well. I don't mind doing poorly on a test as long as everyone else is doing equally as bad.
[time=2586] But don't you get an A when I'm doing bad, because then I'm going to be angry because you're doing better.
[time=2596] That's what this word is all about. It begins with a small fire that begins to boil over that I want what somebody else has.
[time=2606] Envy produces strife. In that combination, envy and strife are really the unfolding of human history.
[time=2614] The first human conflict we come to in the Bible is Cain and Abel.
[time=2619] Cain killed Abel why he was envious over what his brother had. Envy led to strife.
[time=2627] His brother had to sacrifice. That sacrifice was acceptable. Envy and strife.
[time=2632] Abraham and Lot had to part family relationships and move into separate geographical relationships because his herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen were envious over each other's lives.
[time=2643] And others livestock and properties.
[time=2648] Joseph and his brothers entered into strife that was born over envy and jealousy not over a coat of many colors, but over a father's love who seemed to be disproportionately addressed to one.
[time=2663] Envy and strife.
[time=2667] David came to the rescue of Israel and won the fondness of the great King Saul's heart until the women began to sing out in the streets.
[time=2675] The song was Saul has slain his thousands, but David is ten thousands and Saul's heart began to burn with anger and he was envious.
[time=2689] Solomon is presented a dilemma. Two mothers, two babies, one dead, the other alive.
[time=2700] One of the mothers rolled over and crushed the baby, took her child and traded it with a living baby.
[time=2708] In the morning the mother of the living child woke up and identified the problem. The matter came before King Solomon who wisely suggested they cut the baby in half.
[time=2720] One of the mothers said, "Oh no, don't take it." And put it to a sword, just give it to this woman.
[time=2727] The other one said, "That's fine, cut it into." That woman was so jealous that somebody had a living baby that she was determined she'd rather have the baby dead.
[time=2737] There's a lot of somebody else to have a living baby when she had none, strife born out of jealousy.
[time=2746] Daniel is placed in the lion's den because the leaders of the Babylonian intelligentsia saw him rising in prominence and their own attention decreasing proportionately.
[time=2763] So they can I have to plan to have him killed out of envy and out of strife.
[time=2772] A son takes his inheritance and leaves and squanders it and ends up in poverty and humbly he comes home and asks his father's forgiveness.
[time=2782] And a brother says, "That's not fair. I'm going to leave if you give one more thing to him." Envy and strife.
[time=2797] Jesus Christ walks into a scene and his only crimes are assisting lame people to walk, enabling blind people to see, preaching forgiveness in new life to a nation that's dying.
[time=2811] But there were a group of people that saw him as a threat to their own popularity and so out of envy and out of strife.
[time=2820] They killed him.
[time=2825] Proverbs 27, 4 says, "Anger is cruel and fury can be overwhelming, but who can stand before strife?"
[time=2839] But remember our context. We're talking today about spiritual gifts.
[time=2844] You see what was happening in the life of Corinth is everybody had a gift that was a believer. That was God's plan.
[time=2850] But there were those who said, "I want my gift to get more attention.
[time=2856] I don't like it that we always have to draw the wisdom from the person who has that gift.
[time=2863] I don't like it that it's always prophet so and so that people say, "Praise God after he speaks.
[time=2870] I don't like it that it's always this woman who gets the attention.
[time=2876] What about me? What about my gifts?"
[time=2882] And maybe it's not always spiritual gifts but ministries.
[time=2885] Why is it that we always talk so highly about such and such a program?
[time=2890] We never mention mine, but love is a different quality.
[time=2897] Love says, "Doesn't matter to me." Who does the job and who's got the gifts?
[time=2904] I'm so thankful God's given gifts to the church that we can grow together and we can be edified together.
[time=2909] That's the only reason God gave spiritual gifts.
[time=2912] God never gave a spiritual gift for the benefit of the gifted one.
[time=2916] He always gave it for the benefit of the body.
[time=2919] Just look back to chapter 12, verse 7.
[time=2922] Now to each one, the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good.
[time=2927] God gives somebody a gift, it's not for that person, it's for the good of the whole body.
[time=2932] Chapter 14, verse 3 says, "But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouraging and comforting."
[time=2944] In those days God gave a gift of prophecy, that prophet was to speak, not so that people would say, "Phew, what a prophet!"
[time=2952] Man, that guy's great!
[time=2955] So that prophet could say, "Yes, I've got this gift and I really enjoy the exercising of my gift."
[time=2962] It's for the good of people.
[time=2964] Verse 5.
[time=2969] "I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather you have prophecy.
[time=2974] He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues unless he interprets so that the church may be edified."
[time=2983] Paul, in those days, was saying spiritual gifts are speaking in tongues for today.
[time=2988] And I'm happy if every one of you happens to have that gift, but I would really rather that you all had the gift of prophecy.
[time=2995] Because if somebody speaks in tongues unless there's interpretation, there's no edification.
[time=3000] If there's no edification, there's no purpose for the gift.
[time=3003] Verse 12.
[time=3006] "So it is with you, since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in the gifts that build up the church."
[time=3014] God never gave people a spiritual gift so they could say, "Oh, I feel so good after I exercise my gift.
[time=3019] I just get this euphoric rush, it's great.
[time=3021] Give me a chance to use my gift." That is no place in spiritual gifts.
[time=3027] It's simply to admonish, encourage, strengthen, comfort the rest of the body.
[time=3032] And then we don't need to be envious of who's doing it, it's being done for all of our good.
[time=3037] Love does not envy.
[time=3039] But you know, envy often leads to pride.
[time=3045] Because somebody has a gift and this person wants it and I've got it.
[time=3050] Didn't Paul just say, "I wish that all of you prophesied." In steps, the four daughters of Agabus who says, "We're the prophetess." God's given us that gift.
[time=3061] And so there comes two more descriptions of love.
[time=3064] Love does not boast.
[time=3069] It is not proud.
[time=3072] The idea behind the word boast simply means to parade our abilities.
[time=3079] When a Roman general conquered a new province, there would be a parade that was held in his honor.
[time=3087] It was called a triumphant march.
[time=3090] And as they would come into the city, first of all would come the players of the drums and the brass instruments.
[time=3095] They would play loud.
[time=3097] That got everybody's attention so that everyone would stop and see what's happening.
[time=3102] Then would come the mighty soldiers, the more the better, dressed in their uniforms, brandishing their swords and shields, showing their might and strength.
[time=3111] And they would come marching through the city.
[time=3113] And then there would be a little gap as people would wait for the general to come.
[time=3118] And they would all praise this general.
[time=3121] And then behind the general would come some of the nobility of that conquered land in chains, showing that he had conquered them.
[time=3129] And some of their prized possessions of precious metals and jewels showing that he was the victor.
[time=3136] That's what the word to boast actually means.
[time=3139] It means to parade our accomplishments.
[time=3144] Oh, we can do that so humbly.
[time=3147] My fingers are so sore.
[time=3149] You know, I was just at the church the other day.
[time=3152] Oh, stuffing three or four thousand envelopes.
[time=3154] And you know how that paper is on your fingers.
[time=3156] Do you happen to have any lotion?
[time=3158] I mean, isn't that humbly just saying, I just want to parade in front of you what I did this week?
[time=3166] Oh, boy, my voice is really tired.
[time=3169] I've got to speak three times today and a couple times next week at the college.
[time=3174] Boy, just pray for me that my voice holds out.
[time=3178] Parade our opportunities.
[time=3180] And we can do that so humbly just to make sure that everybody knows what we've done.
[time=3185] Oh, boy, my tired sense of sky.
[time=3188] Yeah, we've got an active flock.
[time=3191] Boy, I had two or three people call me late last night just to pray for him.
[time=3196] You know what we're doing?
[time=3198] We're making sure that everybody knows all of our spiritual service.
[time=3203] We're parading it.
[time=3205] We're wanting a little bit of attention for ourselves.
[time=3210] The companion to that, not really as a completely unique thought, he says, love is not proud.
[time=3218] That word in the King James puts it even better.
[time=3221] It is not puffed up, inflated.
[time=3223] We use the expression, somebody has a big head.
[time=3227] That's what's meant here.
[time=3228] Somebody doesn't boast.
[time=3229] They don't parade it.
[time=3230] And they're not arrogant.
[time=3232] They're not proud of what they've done.
[time=3235] They're not inflated.
[time=3237] They don't tend to exaggerate their own importance of their own significance.
[time=3243] True love doesn't care who gets the attention, who has the gifts, where the glory goes, as
[time=3249] long as it is God that is being glorified.
[time=3254] The Corinthians were a puffed up people.
[time=3256] Paul's used that word of them several times.
[time=3258] Back in chapter 4, he says, just because there's a church there in Corinth and God's done some great things there, you've got spiritual pride.
[time=3266] You're puffed up and he criticizes them.
[time=3269] Then in chapter 5, verse 2, he says, you're puffed up with pride because you think it's wonderful that there's somebody who's involved in incest in your church.
[time=3279] It's despicable, but you're puffed up with pride.
[time=3283] Chapter 8, verse 2, he says, once again, you're puffed up with knowledge.
[time=3287] You're inflated.
[time=3288] It's out of proportionate, out of significance.
[time=3292] Pride and boasting say, let all the attention be on me.
[time=3297] Gordon McDonald has written an excellent book entitled, Ordering Your Private World.
[time=3303] In the early chapters, he distinguishes between the man or woman who is called out by God to do something versus the individual who is driven of themselves to achieve something.
[time=3315] He lists several qualities of these people.
[time=3318] Let me list just a few of them.
[time=3320] A driven person is only gratified by accomplishments.
[time=3325] Look what I've achieved.
[time=3327] Look what I've done.
[time=3330] Secondly, a driven person is preoccupied with the symbols of their achievement.
[time=3336] It's not enough that I've achieved.
[time=3338] I've got to have some way of visualizing that so all that you can recognize how much I've accomplished.
[time=3344] Thirdly, a driven person is caught in the uncontrolled pursuit of expansion.
[time=3351] I mean, it feels so good to accomplish, and it feels great that others recognize my accomplishments.
[time=3356] So my corporations got to get bigger.
[time=3358] My profits have got to increase.
[time=3359] My sales have got to expand.
[time=3361] My influence and territory has got to grow.
[time=3364] And then fourthly, driven people have a limited regard for integrity.
[time=3371] That puffed up nature begins to say things that are just a little bit gooder than true.
[time=3380] And in an attempt to achieve our points, we begin to compromise on the truth.
[time=3387] Two little boys were walking down the street with a dog, and something peculiar was happening.
[time=3392] They were stopping and talking to another little boy, and then they'd go on and talk to another little boy and go on and talk to another little boy.
[time=3398] And a preacher saw all this.
[time=3401] Finally, when the little boys came by him, he said, "Hey boys, what are you up to with that dog?" The boy said, "Well, we found this dog.
[time=3408] We don't know who it belongs to, and the whole gang of us want the dog, and we can't decide who gets it." So we've decided whoever tells the biggest and best lie gets to keep the dog.
[time=3419] The minister said, "That's not a very good idea.
[time=3422] You know, that lying is never a good idea.
[time=3424] When I was a little boy like you, I never told lies." One little boy looked to the other and they say, "Okay, mister, you win the dog."
[time=3435] A limited regard for integrity.
[time=3438] That simply to gain the attention, to accomplish our goals, we stretch the truth.
[time=3447] Pride being puffed up says, "Notice me.
[time=3453] Look what I've done.
[time=3456] Allow me to have some of the glory." In our first service, a kind lady wrote down something she had in the back of her Bible for me.
[time=3465] I want to share it with you.
[time=3467] It's a simple little prayer.
[time=3469] May it be ours.
[time=3471] Lord, I renounce my desire for human praise.
[time=3477] For the approval of my peers.
[time=3480] The need for public recognition.
[time=3485] I deliberately put these aside today.
[time=3490] We can tend to hear you whisper, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."
[time=3500] You've been listening to the special music by our church musicians and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3526] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3531] Before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3534] Will you pray this prayer with me?
[time=3537] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3544] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3550] I ask you to come into my heart today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3557] If you've prayed with me today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3561] And then when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
