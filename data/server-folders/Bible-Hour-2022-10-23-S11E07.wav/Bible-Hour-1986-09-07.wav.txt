[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=90] (bells chiming) - Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking,
[time=116] it is not easily provoked.
[time=119] Jonathan Edwards, the great Puritan preacher, had a daughter who was easily provoked.
[time=125] A young man came to Edwards and asked if he could marry the great preacher's daughter.
[time=130] Edwards said, "No, why not ask the young man?
[time=134] "She's a Christian, isn't she?" "Why, yes, she is," said Edwards.
[time=140] "Well, then why can't I marry her?" asked the young man.
[time=144] And Edwards replied, "Because the grace of God "can dwell with some people, with whom no one else "could ever possibly live." - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Locks.
[time=160] Thank you for joining us.
[time=162] Today, Rick's message is taken from 1 Corinthians, chapter 13, and is entitled, "Love is not self-seeking." Definitions of love are often vague and often humorous.
[time=172] Love is a fuzzy feeling down inside, and love means never having to say you're sorry.
[time=178] As we continue our study in 1 Corinthians 13, the great love chapter, we will learn three new qualities of love according to God's definition.
[time=187] Love is not rude, love is not self-seeking, and love is not easily provoked.
[time=192] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians, chapter 13.
[time=197] We will be looking at verses four through eight.
[time=201] Special music for today's service will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir.
[time=206] We'll also be hearing from a new mixed ensemble, and Susan Toyrac.
[time=213] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Rock Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=221] It is our prayer that the Lord will use the entire worship service to draw you closer to Him.
[time=228] Now, here's Rick.
[time=230] - I want to say welcome to our friends who are joining us now at the Bible Hour, and we trust that God will use our worship together to bring honor and glory to His name.
[time=238] Our choir has grown with the return of the fall season, and we appreciate their work in leading us in worship and drawing attention to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=248] As they sing about His glory, all hail the power of Jesus' name.
[time=252] (gentle music)
[time=262] [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=394] - What a privilege to sing to our Lord
[time=404] and crown Him, Lord of all.
[time=405] We'll continue with that theme as we sing together, Him number 13.
[time=409] Crown Him with many crowns, Him number 13.
[time=413] Versus one, three, and five.
[time=429] [MUSIC - 109 seconds]
[time=542] - Thank you very much for your good singing,
[time=549] very vital part of our worship service together, and singing praises to our Lord.
[time=553] And we're grateful that you participated today.
[time=557] This is the start-up of the fall season for a lot of our departments in our church.
[time=561] The music department has been functioning throughout the summer, but I for one am glad that the fall is here so we can get on a better routine.
[time=568] We've started some new groups.
[time=569] And today we have a new ensemble that's going to be singing for us.
[time=573] They're gonna sing a song entitled "Celebrate Life." (upbeat music)
[time=580] [MUSIC - 198 seconds]
[time=779] - Again, I want to thank you for joining us today
[time=788] for the Bible hour.
[time=790] We've slipped away from our morning worship service for a moment to pre-record just a few words to you who join us for the Bible hour.
[time=798] Pete and I would like to share with you an excellent little pamphlet entitled "Timeless Insights." - You know, Rick, that usually many of us need a guide to help us in our daily devotions.
[time=808] It seems like we read the scriptures.
[time=810] In fact, some of the days when you're gone, I even slipped down in your office and look at some of your concordances and helps.
[time=816] But the "Timeless Insights" is something that's very convenient to put right alongside of your Bible and use on a daily Bible study.
[time=823] You know, it really is.
[time=824] Most of us need a guide to help us be faithful studying the Bible and help us draw some applications out of it.
[time=831] As a matter of fact, there are probably quite a few people that if they took their Bible in hand right now, they could take out last Sunday's bulletin and the Sunday before's bulletin and the Sunday before's bulletin, they're sitting there with a Bible that they only use on Sundays.
[time=844] And your growth is only gonna be proportional to the time you spend in God's Word.
[time=849] What "Timeless Insights" is, for those of you who are not familiar, it is a daily Bible reading guide that takes you through the New Testament in one year's timeframe.
[time=858] I suppose that leaves us normally about a chapter a day to read.
[time=862] - Yes.
[time=863] - And as you read that chapter, then you can read "Timeless Insights," which gives you a word from a great commentator of biblical studies.
[time=872] People like Matthew Henry and John Calvin, Martin Luther, A.B. Simpson, even John Wesley, and some of the men who lived hundreds of years ago, along with some more contemporary writers.
[time=884] That's from the source.
[time=885] They get the name "Timeless Insights." We'd love to send you a copy so that you could begin studying God's Word regularly and understanding a practical insight of what you've studied.
[time=897] You can write for "Timeless Insights" by writing to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=904] The zip code is 46815.
[time=907] Just write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=914] If you do write to us and request "Timeless Insights" as quickly as we can, we will send you a copy so you can begin to read with us.
[time=923] The year actually starts with October in the book of Matthew and moves right around the year for the next 12 months ending up in September right now with the book of Revelation.
[time=933] If you write to us, we'll send you the first copy and you'll begin receiving your additional copies monthly.
[time=939] I hope that you will write, and in just a few moments, we'll give you the address once again.
[time=944] Well, there are many things happening here at Black Hawk, and one of those is a building program that we're excited to get underway.
[time=951] We spent some intensive time on building plans and sketches and architects rendering of our building and still working out the final details, but it is getting very exciting, Rick.
[time=962] And what we're planning on building, if God so wills, is a new sanctuary.
[time=967] The Convocation Center here has been an excellent home for us, but we're filling it on two Sunday morning services and we are in great need of a larger auditorium, so we're hoping to build a new sanctuary, which will also become the new home for the Bible hour.
[time=982] And we would certainly appreciate you praying for us in these days of decisions that God will give us wisdom in the planning for that new sanctuary.
[time=991] Well, Pete, would you just share one more time where our friends can write for timeless insights?
[time=995] Yes, let me encourage you to write for the pamphlet that comes on a monthly basis entitled Insights.
[time=1000] And you can receive it by writing to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1008] Well, we just heard a few moments ago from a new musical group here at Blackhawk, and now as we go back to our morning worship service, we have the privilege of hearing from Susan Toyrat.
[time=1021] Susan and Kathy and I and a group of young people were at the Grable Fair, Pete and I were there, and we had the privilege of meeting many Bible hour viewers.
[time=1028] And I want to thank you for introducing yourself to us and encouraging us when we see you in person.
[time=1034] We love to talk with you, and we love to hear from you through the mail.
[time=1037] So please do write and request timeless insights.
[time=1040] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1042] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=1283] - Jesus, you are our Lord and our Master.
[time=1306] We thank you today for the beauty of a song, so well sung, that can take our hearts and capture them, soothe them and calm them.
[time=1316] God, today, we would pray that your spirit would take to our hearts a continued healing potion of peace.
[time=1324] We would pray today that you as the God of all peace would master our hearts and give us peace.
[time=1332] We pray today for those who are going through some dark valleys, some deep hurts.
[time=1338] Pray for several men in this church who have been abandoned by their wives, some women who are today facing life alone and feel the sting of rejection.
[time=1352] God, we pray for those who today are facing mountains
[time=1358] that seem so large.
[time=1360] We pray today for Jim and Sue that you would encourage them, help them to face each day.
[time=1366] We pray for Marv Degas as he battles an uncertain enemy
[time=1372] that has attacked his body, that you would give doctors wisdom to diagnose and to treat.
[time=1378] We pray that you would encourage his heart and the wife of his years, Hazel, that you might give strength to her inner person.
[time=1389] Pray today particularly for Harry Bloster and his family as he battles cancer and a blood infection that you would make effective every procedure and practice that the medical world has put into place.
[time=1401] God, we would pray today for Lois Clancy as she faces
[time=1407] a surgery that the kidney that is donated might be a strong functioning kidney that her body might accept it totally, that her brother might recover quickly from a transplant donation.
[time=1420] Pray for Troy Clark with the repair that's been done to his eye socket that there might be some freedom from pain.
[time=1428] We pray for his family that you would meet their every need at this time.
[time=1432] God, through your word, we pray that you would take a single message and apply it to hundreds of lives at a completely different point of need.
[time=1443] God, we would pray that today to those who are down, you would pick them up, to those who are discouraged, you would encourage them, for those who are weak that you would strengthen them, for those who are timid that you would make them courageous, for those who are uncertain to give them confidence, for those who are overconfident that you would temper us, that each of us might find your hand gently shaping us today, to be more like the Lord Jesus Christ, in whose name we pray.
[time=1478] [AMEN] He was one of the greatest preachers of American history.
[time=1485] He thundered the word of God out of a strong voice in a committed heart.
[time=1490] His name was Jonathan Edwards.
[time=1493] Jonathan Edwards had a daughter who was probably much like her father.
[time=1499] She was strong.
[time=1500] She was domineering, but she had a boyfriend.
[time=1505] After a number of years, this boyfriend came to Jonathan Edwards, as was the custom of that day, and asked the great preacher, if he could marry Jonathan Edwards' daughter.
[time=1514] Jonathan Edwards sternly rejected the whole proposal.
[time=1519] The young man inquired, "Is there something wrong with me "that I'm not suitable to be your son-in-law?" Edward assured him there was nothing about him that was deemed unworthy.
[time=1531] He said, "What's wrong?
[time=1533] "Is it your daughter?
[time=1534] "Is she not a Christian?" And Edward said, "She's a Christian indeed." Young man said, "Well, then why can't I marry her?" Jonathan Edwards said to the would-be husband, young man, "There are some people "with whom the grace of God can dwell, "with whom no one else possibly could." First Corinthians 13 talks about the qualities of a life with whom somebody could dwell.
[time=1562] The great chapter on love gives to a 16 different descriptions.
[time=1567] We'll look at three of those today.
[time=1569] First Corinthians 13 verses four through eight describes love in this way.
[time=1575] Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy,
[time=1583] it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it does not keep record of wrongs.
[time=1598] Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[time=1603] It always protects, always trusts,
[time=1610] always hopes, always perseveres, love never fails.
[time=1615] Sixteen little words that describe love.
[time=1623] One time a young boy was asked to describe love and he looked into the eyes of his girlfriend and he said, "Love is, well, it's a warm fuzzy feeling deep down inside." Well, this chapter comes to pick up where that fuzzy feeling down inside leaves off.
[time=1640] This is the love that gives us the ability to keep going when all of the emotions, all of its joy, all the good times start wearing off.
[time=1650] It's a love that helps us to accept the brother in this church who is completely different than we are.
[time=1655] It's love that makes us hang in with a son who we would like to put for sale on our next garage sale.
[time=1664] It's the type of ability that makes us embrace people who our arms just don't naturally reach up and want to embrace.
[time=1671] It's a love that begins to trim at us, knocking off our rough spots.
[time=1678] I wanna confess to you that as I'm studying this chapter on love, it has not been the highlight of my life.
[time=1686] It's a lot like taking a trip to the proverbial woodshed
[time=1692] because none of us can say, I'm patient, I'm kind, I never envy, oh, I got proud one time but I was only three years old and I overcame it the next year.
[time=1703] We all fail at this and yet it's God's standard and don't ever fall prey to the false idea of what we need to do is we need to lower the standard so we'll all feel better about ourselves.
[time=1716] We'll feel better about ourselves and we'll feel worse about everybody else.
[time=1721] This is God's standard.
[time=1722] None of us live up to it, but by his grace, he is enabling us to grow day by day in the truth of his word and in the grace of his spirit to become less like ourselves and more like his son and as the button puts it so well, please be patient.
[time=1740] God is not finished with any of us yet.
[time=1744] Three qualities of love.
[time=1747] Love is not rude, it is not self-seeking.
[time=1751] It is not easily angered.
[time=1754] The word rude probably speaks for itself but allow me to throw out a few synonyms and antonyms to help us focus in on a quality of love and I think it's very important.
[time=1768] It's the idea of being insensitive to others or being thoughtless or graceless.
[time=1774] It's the concept of being crude and abrasive.
[time=1779] It's that man or woman whose personality can be best described as coarse sandpaper.
[time=1786] It's the individual who lacks tact in respectfulness and mannerliness.
[time=1793] I heard Chuck Swindall one time describe tact in this way.
[time=1797] Tact is the ability to make people feel right at home when you wish they were.
[time=1803] That's tact.
[time=1807] Ruteness is just the opposite quality.
[time=1810] It's the quality that makes people feel uncomfortable.
[time=1813] It's the quality that makes people feel that they've rubbed up against barbed wire.
[time=1818] Isn't it amazing that we have to be instructed
[time=1824] in God's Word to simply apply appropriate social graces?
[time=1828] Sometimes we have become so spiritually minded that we think as long as we're spiritually minded we can do anything we want socially and people have to love us because we're Christians and you're my brother, Steve, so you have to love me.
[time=1843] And we can therefore behave unkind unlovingly without any graciousness.
[time=1847] And everybody's just supposed to love us.
[time=1850] Well, the truth is we're supposed to love those people.
[time=1854] But if you're one of those people, then you have a responsibility to become mannerly, to become respectful, to become approachable.
[time=1866] There are a lot of personality types and every personality type is like a coin.
[time=1871] It has two faces.
[time=1873] One face is a list of strengths and the other face is a list of weaknesses.
[time=1879] There's no right personality type.
[time=1882] But the person who usually struggles with rudeness is a person whose personality type tends to be the dominant type.
[time=1890] Depending on whose books you read, there are all types of personality behaviors.
[time=1896] Some will call this one melancholy and this one sanguine and this one flagmatic and this one caloric.
[time=1902] Some will say this one's dominant, this one's influencer, this one's steadfast or this one's compliant.
[time=1908] However you divide them, there are some personalities that operate almost exclusively out of position of strength.
[time=1916] They will work by dominating the situation.
[time=1919] If that's your personality, praise God for it but know your weakness.
[time=1926] Your weakness if you're a dominant personality is that you tend to become domineering.
[time=1932] You tend to only be able to function in a situation where you're in charge.
[time=1936] You tend to always speak your peace and you justify your insensitivity by saying somebody's got to stand up for the truth.
[time=1946] Somebody's got to get this place organized and you're almost always right.
[time=1952] It's not a matter of being right.
[time=1955] It's a matter of being gracious.
[time=1956] It's probably becoming my favorite verse.
[time=1962] John chapter one verse 18, said of Jesus Christ, we beheld his glory.
[time=1967] Glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.
[time=1973] Both of those are essential ingredients and both of those are very dangerous ingredients without the other.
[time=1981] We must keep truth and grace in complete balance.
[time=1986] It's like a teeter totter.
[time=1987] I don't know whether you go to parks and ride teeter totters but we ride a lot of teeter totters.
[time=1994] We have two little girls and a little boy.
[time=1996] There's a science to teeter tottering.
[time=2000] This is all free.
[time=2001] You don't have to pay extra for this lesson in teeter tottering.
[time=2004] The key to having a good time teeter tottering is to get people of the same weights on each end of the teeter totter.
[time=2012] Somehow when my three year old son's on one end of the teeter totter and I'm on the other, it just doesn't work.
[time=2020] I'm always on the ground and as soon as I push up, we go up and crash right back down.
[time=2027] The whole thing's out of balance.
[time=2029] But we've got two little girls, Rachel and Rebecca.
[time=2032] Probably only an inch difference in height and a pound or two in weight and you can put those little girls on the teeter totter and it goes back and forth perfectly.
[time=2041] You know why?
[time=2042] There's the same amount on one end as there is on the other end.
[time=2046] If you want your life to balance perfectly, there's gotta be as much grace on this end as there is truth on the other end.
[time=2054] There's nothing positive about only being truthful without being grace us.
[time=2061] The Bible says we are to speak the truth but in love and to let your speech always be full of grace seasoned with salt.
[time=2070] Truth without sensitivity is only condemnation
[time=2076] and you won't find people easily buying into your plan.
[time=2080] But then on the other hand, we can't just throw the truth out and say, "Well, let's just love everybody.
[time=2085] "Let's just be gracious.
[time=2086] "We wanna embrace the whole world for Jesus Christ." That really sounds nice except for we can embrace them and hold their hand all the way to hell if we don't speak the truth in love.
[time=2098] There's gotta be balance.
[time=2101] Now, if you're on that teeter totter and you have a son, like I have a son named Madden
[time=2111] who weighs 30 pounds and you're on the other end and you, like me, weigh a whole lot more than 30 pounds, there's a way that you can make it work.
[time=2122] You see, in the middle of a teeter totter, there's a fulcrum and that is the point of contact.
[time=2128] And if you're out of balance on one end, you simply have to move the teeter totter so the fulcrum, the point of contact, is at the heavier end.
[time=2138] In which end is your life out of balance?
[time=2143] Are you out of balance on the truth side?
[time=2145] Then move the point of contact, God's word, close to that end and start reading everything it says about being gracious.
[time=2154] You're out of balance on the other end and you're a very gracious person but you never get the truth said and you need to take the fulcrum, God's word and move the point of contact closer and start reading what God says about being truthful.
[time=2169] Our lives have to be in balance, full of grace and truth.
[time=2176] It's the rude person who steps forward and demands the attention.
[time=2182] It was insensitive and abrasive to others and most often he or she is sure they're right in what they're saying.
[time=2188] That came up in the area of spiritual gifts with the Corinthians.
[time=2194] It came up in how they treated each other.
[time=2196] You may remember, we studied chapter 11.
[time=2199] In chapter 11, they had what was called a love feast.
[time=2204] They came together and they had really a church carrying dinner, a potluck dinner.
[time=2208] But some of the people raced in, set the food down and as soon as the pastor said amen on your market said go, they dashed over to the table, they loaded up their plates, they took excesses of everything, they gorged themselves, they raced back, beat everybody else to the dessert line.
[time=2224] And then when other people came through there was the lasagna plate.
[time=2229] The only part that was left was the part that was baked solid against the pan.
[time=2233] They had to turn the spatula over, scrape it off.
[time=2238] That was dinner.
[time=2241] Why?
[time=2242] Because there were those who were rude, whose philosophy of life was me first.
[time=2248] Came out in spiritual gifts.
[time=2252] Look at chapter 14, verse 26.
[time=2256] What shall we say, brothers?
[time=2259] When you come together, everyone has a hymn or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue and interpretation, all of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.
[time=2272] If anyone speaks in a tongue, two are at the most, three should speak at one time and somebody must interpret.
[time=2280] Here's what was happening in the Corinthians church.
[time=2284] Song leaders stood up and said, okay, who would like to pick a hymn tonight?
[time=2287] What would you like to sing?
[time=2288] And somebody over here yelled, song 121 and somebody over here yelled, ah, we sang that last week, let's sing 150.
[time=2296] Everybody demanded that their song be sung.
[time=2298] Somebody else said, I've got a word of instruction.
[time=2302] I was reading in timeless insights last week and here's something that you need to hear.
[time=2307] And they were all demanding that they have the right to choose what hymns were sung in and to teach and to preach and to speak in tongues and have a word of prophecy.
[time=2315] And it was basically saying, I've got an opinion, an idea, a gift, and I demand the attention.
[time=2322] They were rude and they were insensitive with each other.
[time=2326] Fully lacking intact grace, life was out of balance.
[time=2331] True love is sensitive to other people
[time=2339] and it puts a guard against rudeness.
[time=2343] Somebody has written what they called the 10 Commandments of Human Relationships.
[time=2347] Let me share them with you quickly.
[time=2349] Rule number one, Commandment number one, speak to people.
[time=2354] There is nothing as nice as a cheerful word of greeting.
[time=2360] Rule number two, smile.
[time=2364] Smile with people.
[time=2366] It takes 72 muscles to frown and only 14 to smile.
[time=2371] If that's not good enough for a reason, just smile.
[time=2375] It will make others wonder what you're up to and it'll make them uncomfortable all day.
[time=2380] But you know, there are some of us that our face is almost permanently shaped in a frown.
[time=2385] And when we smile, we just get our lips back up the level.
[time=2388] And it takes more energy to frown than it does to smile.
[time=2394] And isn't it winsome just to see somebody smile and to hear a little chuckle?
[time=2400] What a difference it can make in someone's life.
[time=2404] Number three, call people by name.
[time=2407] The sweetest music is the sound of our own name.
[time=2410] When Ben Franklin started printing in Philadelphia, he said, I know how to sell more papers than anybody else.
[time=2416] He said, I'll simply print the name of each person in Philadelphia and they'll all rush to buy my papers.
[time=2422] Isn't that true?
[time=2423] Most of the time we kind of fan through the paper and what if somebody called you and say, hey, did you read the paper day?
[time=2429] Oh, I kind of looked at it.
[time=2430] Really, your name's in it.
[time=2431] Really, what page, what section is that?
[time=2433] Save it for me.
[time=2434] Don't throw it away.
[time=2436] We love our name.
[time=2438] We might not have been the one we've picked out, but since we've got it, we love to hear it.
[time=2442] Isn't it wonderful to meet somebody one time and then to not see them for some time and then to see us again and to call us by name?
[time=2452] That's a way of saying to somebody you're important.
[time=2456] I care about you.
[time=2459] Number four, be friendly and helpful.
[time=2463] Number five, be cordial.
[time=2467] Speak and act as if everything you say is a genuine pleasure.
[time=2472] If you're not excited about what you're doing in life, don't expect others to be.
[time=2478] Be genuinely interested in people.
[time=2487] You can like everybody if you try.
[time=2490] Now, I know some people have made it their job to make it challenging, but even the least desirable person has some redeeming and positive qualities in their life.
[time=2501] Focus in on it.
[time=2503] Number seven, be generous with praise
[time=2510] and cautious with criticism.
[time=2513] Bet if we had a show of hands and we said, "How many of you feel like your phone rings too often?" About half of the people would raise their hands.
[time=2521] And I've complained and you've complained about all the phone calls that come at a very busy time in life, but in listening to people complain about phone calls, I've never yet heard a person say, "If that phone rings one more time with somebody telling me how well they think I'm doing, I'm gonna yank it off the wall." I just can't take any more encouragement.
[time=2543] People are always telling me how much they appreciate me and it's driving me crazy.
[time=2548] Have you ever said that?
[time=2551] Have you ever heard anybody say that?
[time=2553] Have you ever met somebody who said, "I can't stand anymore.
[time=2558] I don't think I'm doing that good, but everybody in the world thinks I am and so I'm just gonna accept life and be happy." None of us are over encouraged.
[time=2568] Number eight, be considerate of the feelings of others.
[time=2574] It will be appreciated.
[time=2575] Number nine, be thoughtful of the opinion of others.
[time=2580] I love this one.
[time=2582] There are always three sides to any controversy.
[time=2586] Yours, theirs and the right one.
[time=2588] And aren't we usually certain that our opinion is the right one?
[time=2592] Number 10, be alert to give service.
[time=2598] What counts most in life is what counts most to others.
[time=2605] In some ways, it's strange that on a Sunday morning, we would take two or three minutes to give 10 commandments of human relationships.
[time=2612] But there's probably nothing that is more indicting against Christianity than Christians who are rude and insensitive.
[time=2624] True love is not rude.
[time=2629] Secondly, in our list of studies today, true love is not self-seeking.
[time=2635] A brother and sister were riding on a horse.
[time=2637] It wasn't a big horse and it was a little crowded on the horse, so the brother said to a sister, you know, sis, if one of us was to get off this horse, there'd be more room for me.
[time=2647] True love is not self-seeking.
[time=2654] It sees the other person is more important than that their rights, their privileges, ought to come before my rights, and my privileges.
[time=2666] There is an excellent Bible commentator for history and grammatical insights, for theology, he's not so good.
[time=2676] But William Barclay writes this, love is not self-seeking, or love does not seek its own rights, he writes.
[time=2685] In the last analysis, there are only two kinds of people in this world.
[time=2689] Those who are continually thinking about their rights and those who are continually thinking about their duties.
[time=2697] Those who always insist upon their privileges and those who always remember their responsibilities.
[time=2707] Those who are always thinking of what life owes them
[time=2713] and those who never forget what they owe to life.
[time=2718] It would be the key to almost all the problems which surround us today if men would think less of their rights and more of their duties.
[time=2728] Whenever we start thinking about our place, we're drifting away from Christ's place of being first in our lives.
[time=2740] Rights and privileges, duties and responsibilities.
[time=2745] True love doesn't seek for its own privileges
[time=2754] and its own rights, but for the privileges and the rights of others around them.
[time=2761] This really is reminiscent of chapter 10.
[time=2765] You might wanna turn back there.
[time=2767] Chapter 10 is part of a lengthy discussion, chapters eight, nine, 10, that talk about questionable practices.
[time=2775] Is it all right to go to movies?
[time=2777] Down at the Ariapagos, they're showing Ben Heard, the original version of it, is all right to go.
[time=2783] Well, is it all right to drink wine?
[time=2786] Well, what if it's three parts water and one part wine?
[time=2789] It's all right to eat meat that's on and offer titles.
[time=2792] Is it all right to eat it if you go to somebody's house and you didn't know when you ate it, what you're eating?
[time=2797] All these questionable practices.
[time=2799] Lots of principles.
[time=2801] One of those principles is found, nestled in versus 23 and 24.
[time=2808] Everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial.
[time=2811] Everything is permissible, but not everything is constructive.
[time=2815] Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others.
[time=2821] Verse 33.
[time=2823] Even Paul says, "As I try to please everybody and every way, "for I'm not seeking my own good, but the good of many, "so that they may be saved." True love is a love that doesn't care first what happens to me, but cares first what happens to others.
[time=2844] It's duty and responsibility-oriented and not privilege-oriented.
[time=2849] One of the great tragedies of my generation, some of you are just a little older, but you still fit, is we're a product of the post-war baby boom.
[time=2860] And our parents who went through the Great Depression and then the Great World War II came out of that saying, "I will provide security and privileges for my children.
[time=2873] "I will not allow them to go through the depression, "and I will not allow them to suffer through the things "we suffered in the shortages of World War II.
[time=2882] "I will give them everything they ever needed and wanted, "and most of us, I was one.
[time=2888] "We were giving everything we wanted in life.
[time=2892] "I thought my parents own Cedar Point.
[time=2894] "It was really a shock to me.
[time=2896] "We went there so often, we probably bought part of it.
[time=2900] "What has happened is we were raised "with so many blessings, so many privileges, "so many rights that suddenly adulthood is thrust upon us, "and it starts bringing to our attention "responsibilities, duties, obligations.
[time=2921] "Can I confess to you that a week ago yesterday, "I was at Cedar Point, and I liked it better "when my mom and dad stood in the line waiting for me "for the rides I wanted than standing there, "watching my kids ride rides for 13 hours.
[time=2942] (audience laughing) "I got to ride one ride, but it was my favorite ride, "the French fry stand.
[time=2950] "The rest of the day, it was all on little kids' rides, "and that isn't how I remembered Cedar Point.
[time=2956] "And many of us, we've now grown up, "and the responsibilities are coming to us, "and many of you are saying, if it's responsibility "that makes a marriage work, I don't know "that I want to be married.
[time=2967] "If it's responsibility and duty to raise children, "I'll put them for sale in the next garage sale.
[time=2974] "Three kids, two for the price of one, take your pet.
[time=2978] "We went out because our whole life has been raised
[time=2984] "and oriented to my rights and my privileges.
[time=2990] "I'm a product of that generation.
[time=2994] "I know the harsh realization that the bills "now come to my name and not my dads.
[time=2999] "The true love says, I'm not gonna seek my own.
[time=3003] "I'm gonna seek the best of the others around me.
[time=3008] "That's tough, that's love." Same thing came up with the area of spiritual gifts.
[time=3018] Those that said, "I've got the gift of prophecy, "and this church better have a place for me "to prophesy, somebody else who I've got the gift "of speaking in tongues, and I haven't had a chance "to speak in years in this first church of Corinth.
[time=3032] "And if I don't get a chance, well, "there's a lot of churches that would like "to have my abilities." God gives spiritual gifts, not for you,
[time=3042] but for you to edify others.
[time=3045] I remember Howard May saying, and it's so true, before you go announce what your spiritual gift is and how you ought to have a chance to use it, you ought to find a few other people who agree with you.
[time=3055] Chapter 14, there were those that were insisting upon the exercise of their gifts in verses four and five.
[time=3064] And Paul has to remind them that he weren't given gifts for them, but they were given gifts for others.
[time=3068] Love is not self-seeking.
[time=3072] It doesn't say if one of us was to get out, there'd be more room for me.
[time=3078] And finally, for today, love is not easily angered.
[time=3083] This word for angered is not our usual New Testament word for angered, it's a word that I like translated provoked.
[time=3093] Now, the word provoke is a neutral word.
[time=3096] To provoke somebody is not necessarily bad.
[time=3098] It's what you provoke them to do.
[time=3101] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24 says, "The church service ought to be a great time "where we get together to provoke each other "under love and under good works." Both Ecclesiastes and Proverbs says, "As iron sharpens iron, soul man's countenance "is sharpened by his friends." One of the greatest privileges that God has given me is to be the pastor of this church and to rub up against some of you.
[time=3128] Because so many of you are the iron of my life and I have a privilege of being around you and you sharpen my life.
[time=3135] To be with you is downright encouraging.
[time=3139] When the phone rings and I don't answer it and Kathy answers it at home and says it's so and so, there's an instant feeling that comes across me that's so positive because I know no matter what happened by the time we get off the phone, I'm gonna feel better.
[time=3154] Then there are others.
[time=3159] Maybe I'm one of those others in your life if I am forgive me.
[time=3166] Because it's our job to provoke each other.
[time=3169] That means when we get around them, we feel better about ourselves and better about other people and most importantly, better about serving Christ.
[time=3179] That's what Hebrews 1024 is saying, we provoke each other.
[time=3183] It's like being at a good sales meeting where you're encouraged and refreshed and challenged.
[time=3192] I played a little bit of football and I need to underline the word a little bit.
[time=3197] There are two types of coaches.
[time=3200] Those who at halftime when you're down, 18 to nothing come in and say, you guys are terrible.
[time=3207] You're getting kicked all over the field.
[time=3209] Now I'm cleaning this up.
[time=3211] You guys are an embarrassment.
[time=3213] And by the time the halftime's over, you'd rather go out and get beat up by the other team as they'll listen to him again.
[time=3221] There are other coaches.
[time=3223] You're down 18 to nothing.
[time=3225] They come in and they say, if they can score 18 points in one half, we can score that in the second half.
[time=3231] You guys are all right.
[time=3233] We've got some weaknesses here and you've got to plug this whole defensively and we've got to get more aggressive, but we can do that.
[time=3239] You know what happens?
[time=3241] A group of guys begin to believe they can do that because they're provoked.
[time=3247] Now here it's saying true love is not easily provoked and the obvious understanding means provoked back to self-interest.
[time=3256] That's what we're talking about immediately prior.
[time=3259] The person who is easily angered or easily provoked is the person who goes on and off like a light switch.
[time=3267] It's like the little boy who everything's fine at home.
[time=3272] His mother says, we're going shopping today.
[time=3276] Your sister and I need to buy some things and at age seven, as a little boy, you think there's not anything worse than going shopping with your mother and sister.
[time=3284] At age 33, I can't think of anything worse.
[time=3288] But that little seven year old boy says, I don't want to go shopping.
[time=3294] The mother says, you've got to go.
[time=3296] That we're all going and it's decided you're going to go and he says, I'm going to run away from home.
[time=3300] He runs upstairs, pack some things and he runs away from home.
[time=3304] You may have heard the story about the little boy he was running away from home.
[time=3307] He walked past the same corner four times.
[time=3309] The police officer said, what are you doing little boy?
[time=3312] He said, I'm running away from home.
[time=3314] The police officer said, you're not making it very far.
[time=3317] He said, what do you expect?
[time=3318] I'm not allowed to cross the street.
[time=3319] You know, some of us have that level of maturity, don't we?
[time=3324] Something didn't go our way.
[time=3326] We're going to run away from home.
[time=3327] Our husband said some things we didn't like.
[time=3332] We'll give him the cold treatment.
[time=3335] Our wife said something we didn't appreciate.
[time=3338] We'll hide the checkbook.
[time=3339] We're mad.
[time=3342] Just like that, we go from fine to bad.
[time=3345] That's easily provoked.
[time=3348] All of us have human defense mechanisms and they're like light switches.
[time=3353] One minute they're on, the other minute they're off.
[time=3356] Love becomes the controlling power in our life that keeps us from flipping other people off fast.
[time=3364] We're so quick tempered in our society today.
[time=3366] We go from happily married to filing divorce papers.
[time=3370] Just yesterday I heard somebody on the radio say, quoting a lawyer out of San Francisco that there are two processes that ought to be started only after the greatest of precautions, embalming and divorce proceedings.
[time=3384] Not to rush into any decision, but to be slow in our reaction to others.
[time=3391] Abigail Van Buren writes a column known as Dear Abby.
[time=3398] Here are her words for parents, called a parents prayer.
[time=3403] Oh Heavenly Father, make me a better parent.
[time=3406] Teach me to understand my children, to listen patiently to what they have to say.
[time=3413] And to answer all their questions kindly, keep me from interrupting or contradicting them.
[time=3420] Make me as courteous to them as I would have them to be to me.
[time=3424] Forbid that I should ever laugh at their mistakes or resort to shame or ridicule when they displease me.
[time=3430] May I never punish them for my own selfish satisfaction
[time=3436] or to show my power.
[time=3438] Let me not tempt my child to lie or to steal and guide me hour by hour that I may demonstrate by all that I say and do that honesty produces happiness.
[time=3450] Reduce I pray the meanness in me.
[time=3454] And when I'm out of a sorts Lord help me to hold my tongue.
[time=3459] May I ever be mindful that my children are children and that I should never expect them to act differently.
[time=3467] They're not adults.
[time=3469] Let me not rob them of the opportunity to wait on themselves and to make decisions.
[time=3474] Bless me with the bigness to grant them all of their reasonable requests and the courage to deny them any privilege that I know will do them harm.
[time=3482] Make me fair and just and kind.
[time=3488] And fit me, O Lord, to be loved and respected and imitated by my children.
[time=3495] Love is not easily provoked in its patient.
[time=3503] There's one who's been kind, who's been patient with us.
[time=3507] Who when we said, Lord, if you'd get out of my life there'd be more room for me who refused to leave and only stepped back to come again to fill the throne when we asked him.
[time=3521] - We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our church musicians and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.

[time=3547] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3551] I ask you to come in today and to forgive me and to cleanse me of my sins.
