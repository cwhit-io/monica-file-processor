[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=90] Are you still speaking to her?
[time=92] Why, of course, I am. Why wouldn't I be?
[time=96] Well, after the terrible thing she did to you?
[time=100] Oh, I distinctly remember forgetting that.
[time=104] (dramatic music) Go, go, go, go.
[time=117] (dramatic music) Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=121] With Pastor Rick Hawks, we're glad you've joined us.
[time=125] Today, Rick's message is entitled "Love is Not a Bookkeeper" and is taken from 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=133] Love thinketh no evil, or as the new international translation puts it, "Love keeps no record of wrongs." Love is the subject of our study today on the Bible Hour.
[time=145] True love, God's love makes a distinct effort to forget the injury that others cause to us.
[time=153] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=158] We will be looking at verses 4 through 8.
[time=162] Special music will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir.
[time=167] We'll also be hearing from Bob Veneto and Lynn Rowell.
[time=176] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Port Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=185] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=190] Now, here's Rick.
[time=196] Good morning and welcome today.
[time=198] It's a joy for us to be able to assemble in this place and to sing the praises of our God and to welcome friends who join us by way of television to share the Bible Hour.
[time=209] Last Sunday night, Kathy and I were speaking and singing.
[time=212] She was singing.
[time=213] I was speaking in South Bend at the installation service for Craig Clapper at the Trinity Evangelical Free Church.
[time=220] What a joy it was for us to not only to see Craig and Jan and the ministry there, but I would guess that we met at least 20 or 30 people who were regular watchers of the Bible Hour and shared how this time together was such a strength to their life.
[time=234] That's our prayer today.
[time=236] For those of us who are able to be here in this place, that God would encourage us and strengthen us through singing and through His Word and that He might broaden that ministry through the ministry of television.
[time=247] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=249] We trust today that in your heart there's a desire to say, "Lord Jesus, I love you, and I want to join my heart and my voice in worshiping you." Thank you for joining us today.

[time=474] One of the privilege it is to fellowship together and to learn of the love of God that is available to us, that love Him.
[time=482] That's why we join together in fellowship with one another and sing His praises and give honor to His name and listen to God's word from our pastor.
[time=491] Let's continue singing as we sing Him No. 49.
[time=494] Blessed be the name of the Lord singing together the first, second, and fourth stanzas, Him No. 49.

[time=1884] Thank you Lynn and Lord Jesus we're learning today that your grace
[time=1892] is enough for me. God we would pray that you would send strengthening grace to the lives of many of our brothers and sisters who today are struggling. We'd pray particularly for teenagers today who are under a great deal of stress and strain because of the society in which they're developing.
[time=1916] We'd pray particularly for a young man who last night went through a traumatic car accident in his own heart there's great fear.
[time=1924] We'd pray today for some of the young ladies in our church who are going through some therapy some counseling others who desperately are looking for some answers.
[time=1937] We pray that your grace would be sufficient for them and for their family their parents. God we would pray for Scott and Angie Weaver and the loss of a child through a miscarriage a second time that you would give grace and strength to them.
[time=1957] Father we would pray for little Kyle Maynard and his parents and his grandparents that you would give strength and grace to them as they go through all types of tests and procedures to find out what can be done to help the young boy.
[time=1972] Father we would pray for strength and grace for those who are recovering from surgery Betty Haberger, Jane Faye Browser.
[time=1983] For those who are fighting constant battles with their health like Virgil in Virginia for Harry Blossett. God we would pray that you would give
[time=1993] strength to each one. God we would pray today for those who are battling with resentment. Those who have been hurt they've been injured but they're not able to forgive and they're not able to forget to bring healing to those damaged emotions.
[time=2012] We ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=2017] Are you still speaking to her? Why of course why wouldn't I be?
[time=2026] Well after all the terrible things she said about you you're still talking to her? Well yes. Well I'd never talk to her if she had said about me what she said about you.
[time=2039] Don't you remember what she said? What was it she said?
[time=2046] Well she said this and this and this. Don't you remember?
[time=2050] Oh yes. I distinctly remember forgetting all of those things.
[time=2057] Isn't that a great line? I distinctly remember forgetting all of those things. First Corinthians chapter 13 begins
[time=2067] a list of 16 actions, qualities of love.
[time=2072] And one thing that love does is it distinctly remembers forgetting injuries. Love is patient, verse four.
[time=2081] Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It
[time=2087] is not rude. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs.
[time=2097] Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[time=2101] It always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
[time=2107] always perseveres. Love never fails. I distinctly remember
[time=2117] forgetting all of that. Love does not keep a record of wrongs. In the King James that phrase says love thinks no evil. New international puts it. Love does not keep a record of wrongs.
[time=2130] The Greek word is a word from which we get our English word logic which means to figure, to count, to to deduce something.
[time=2139] It's used in the Bible to say about the Lord Jesus he was numbered among them.
[time=2145] It's also used in the Bible to talk about somebody being counted or somebody else is reasoning how their thought processes work.
[time=2154] But for the most part this word thinks no evil or doesn't keep a record of wrongs is a bookkeeping term.
[time=2163] I'm not a bookkeeper. If you need somebody who gives great attention to detail and keeps meticulous records don't call me. But there are those whose minds are geared in that area and I
[time=2176] marvel at their ability to retain figures.
[time=2179] But even the greatest of minds needs bookkeeping.
[time=2182] In a bookkeeping system there is a journal that is marked
[time=2188] credits. Second one that has marked debits. And we begin to keep track of who do we all and who owes us. And the bookkeeper's job is to keep a sharp crisp accounting of all of those things.
[time=2207] Emotionally we're not very different. Emotionally we tend to be record keepers.
[time=2214] We tend to look at people and we see the things that they've done wrong and perhaps the things they've done right.
[time=2221] We see the things that they should have done that they didn't do and the things that they should not have done that they did do.
[time=2227] And it begins to formulate our attitude towards those people.
[time=2231] He's always late. He never keeps his promise.
[time=2236] He doesn't spend time with the kids. He spends money on golf instead of flowers.
[time=2241] He bought a bumper sticker that says mother-in-law in trunk. You know in the list of all the things that he does wrong goes right over here.
[time=2250] He doesn't know she has that list. He's got his list.
[time=2254] Mother-in-law wouldn't get in trunk.
[time=2258] Burns the bacon. Meets me at the driveway with a list of demands.
[time=2266] Overuses the credit cards. Lists of wrongs. That's what this word means.
[time=2272] It means that person who mentally keeps an inventory of all the injuries that have been done to them and then begins to behave out of a consciousness
[time=2288] that you hurt me. You injured me.
[time=2293] And it best guards their love for that person and doesn't let it flow
[time=2299] and at worst treats them in the same way that they were treated.
[time=2304] Returning injury for injury. Hurt for hurt.
[time=2308] This passage says that love does not keep a record of wrongs.
[time=2313] That it actually not only forgives but it forgets.
[time=2319] The Bible says that God treats us that way.
[time=2322] That God takes us and when we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior He takes all of our sins as though it were a physical commodity.
[time=2330] Packages every one of our sins together.
[time=2333] Takes a boat out to the middle of the ocean and the Bible says He cast them into the deepest sea. That God looks at our sins, erases them and then the Bible says He remembers them no more.
[time=2347] And in a similar way the Bible says we're to be like God. We are to forgive others and forget what they've done to us and treat them in a loving way. Now if you're like me it's real hard work to forgive
[time=2362] and it's nearly impossible work to forget.
[time=2367] And then there's this theological problem. How does God forget?
[time=2372] I remember Pastor Custer being here and talking about that he said how many of you read your Bible? We all raised our hand. We all read the Bible.
[time=2379] Some lied but we all raised our hand. He said how many of you know that David sinned with Bathsheba and nearly everybody raised their hand.
[time=2388] He said well how did you know that? We all said because we read the Bible.
[time=2392] He said but how did God put it in the Bible if God forgot it?
[time=2398] Let me ask you this. How can God on the one hand be omniscient which is just a compound of two words that says He knows everything?
[time=2407] How can God know absolutely everything and forget my sins?
[time=2411] God, do you remember the time in the third grade when I took that paper wad put in a rubber band shot the teacher and said Johnny did it?
[time=2419] God's omniscient. He's going to say yeah I remember that.
[time=2422] Aha you didn't forget. If God says no I completely forgot that.
[time=2427] See you don't know everything God. Now what's the point?
[time=2432] The point is this that God doesn't technically forget anything. He still knows it and you may not technically be able to forget that somebody injured you but what it does mean is that you forgive them and then you treat them as though your mind never knew that that happened. As we began by saying I specifically
[time=2459] remember forgetting all of that. That's what the biblical concept here is.
[time=2466] We're human beings. God's given us wonderful minds and we don't have an eraser button.
[time=2474] We'll still remember but we can treat people as though we did not remember
[time=2480] and we can as God treats us hold that sin against them no more. Forgiven and forgotten we're not going to bring it up again.
[time=2490] It's not going to enter our relationship and it's not going to control the way I treat you anymore. It's behind us.
[time=2499] It's cast into the depths of the sea. It's separated like our sins as far as the east is from the west. If there is ever going to be
[time=2508] any healing to our damaged relationships it will only come when we take our lists and rip them up and throw them away and refuse to be a score keeper.
[time=2523] Now before we develop this much further I need to explain that there are at least three situations where this does not apply.
[time=2530] Most of us are really good at being in a situation and missing the biblical principles that directly applied to that situation and try to hitch on to some tangent principles that we're more comfortable with. Let me give you three times that this does not apply. The first is in a business relationship.
[time=2553] Most of us in this auditorium say we're homeowners but the truth of the matter is we own the keys to the front door the bank owns everything else.
[time=2562] I'll just suppose and I know none of you would be guilty of this but just suppose you're three weeks behind not three weeks three months behind in your mortgage payments. The phone rings and they say hello is this so-and-so and you say why yes it is. This is the loan officer at your bank.
[time=2579] Oh it is. Yes according to our records you are three months
[time=2585] behind in your payments. Why I'm really sorry to hear that Mr. Banker.
[time=2590] Did you know that 1st Corinthians 13 says you're not supposed to keep a record of wrongs. Now what you need to do is you need to go back to your corporate officers and get out your Bibles and study that passage and quit pastoring us. Thank you and have a wonderful day.
[time=2609] Now the principle you need to focus in on is in Romans 13 8 which says let no debt remain outstanding.
[time=2617] Don't worry about what the banker's doing but we have a tendency to want to
[time=2623] bring other principles in that really aren't the issue.
[time=2626] A second time that this principle does not apply is when you're under someone's authority. Perhaps you're under the authority of the owner of your company. He's your boss or maybe you're in a large structure you're not even reporting to the boss but you have a supervisor.
[time=2643] Your supervisor says come into my office we need to talk for a moment.
[time=2648] You were half hour late twice this past week and that's not only true of this past week it's been true of week after week one two or even three days a week you're late. We can't tolerate that in this company.
[time=2661] You know I was just in church last Sunday boss.
[time=2666] It's a great message. I'll buy you the tape. Our pastor got into this neat verse of the Bible that says you're not supposed to keep a record of wrongs.
[time=2675] Now I know you're my supervisor but you're really going to have to try hard or not to notice those things and when you do don't allow your mind to focus on all those negative thoughts. Now you work on that this week boss and get back to me next week and we'll see how you're doing. That's not the point.
[time=2692] God says that we are to honor those who are in authority over us.
[time=2699] If you're a teenager you and your parents may be competing for
[time=2705] some authority in the home. You're to honor your mother and father.
[time=2708] You know it's interesting that teenagers and parents often feel like their goals are mutually exclusive when their goals are exactly the same thing.
[time=2716] Teenagers says I want my own car. I want my own room. I want my own apartment.
[time=2721] Most of the dads I've talked to they want him to have his own car and give dad's car back. They'd like him to have his own apartment maybe on the west coast a little further away wouldn't be bad.
[time=2732] You know parents and teenagers have exactly the same goals.
[time=2736] The goal is independence for their child.
[time=2740] You think about it when you have a brand new baby they're 100 percent dependent upon you. They're dependent upon you to feed them and they're dependent upon you to take care of the aftermath of that feeding.
[time=2751] They totally depend upon you and there's great excitement as a parent when that child makes them first moves towards independence.
[time=2759] I remember going out to eat and dawning on me that my children were all eating themselves and we no longer ate.
[time=2767] A bite for you, a bite for me, a bite for you and you look at that fork and a bite for me and you start switching forks because of all the foreign substance that's coming back. And finally
[time=2781] the child can feed themselves and it's a monumental day in your life.
[time=2787] I received an urgent phone call at the office one day.
[time=2791] It was from my third child who proudly announced daddy.
[time=2796] I go potty by myself now. That may not be a big deal to you
[time=2802] but the Kathy and I that was exciting news.
[time=2806] What are we saying? We're thrilled that our kids are growing towards independence. I'm looking forward to the day that they safely cross the streets by themselves. They safely walk to school by themselves. I'm looking forward to the day that they drive. A little bit. You know what are we looking for?
[time=2827] We're trying to raise our children to be independent.
[time=2831] Parents want the children to be independent. Children want to be independent. The only thing we're arguing over is the timetable.
[time=2837] And while you're in that timetable, honor your father and mother. It's the first commandment with a promise. Don't ever say dad, violating God's word. You keep bringing up the fact that I didn't cut the grass to get the trash taken out. That's a list of wrongs. Dad, you're not supposed to be doing that. Your under is authority.
[time=2857] Third time that this principle should not be used is to stifle openness and honesty in a relationship.
[time=2866] Men, your wife has to be able to say in an appropriate way, graciously and
[time=2872] lovingly, "Honey, I love you. I know you love me."
[time=2879] But I always feel like I come in last. You say we're going to do this on this night and I plan and I get the babysitter and I get everything all done. And you call again and again and say, "Oh, appointments are running late. I've got this. This is going to happen." I feel like I come in last.
[time=2897] Don't ever use this principle to stifle the openness in your marriage.
[time=2903] Wives, your husband's got to be able to say, "Honey, I love you and I love the kids." And I love coming home. But I don't like coming home when you and the kids are racing down the driveway to be the first to tell me what's on the agenda for that night of things that I must do.
[time=2921] There's got to be some openness. There's got to be some honesty. The principle there is found in Ephesians 4, "Speaking the truth in love." But unless we're trying to develop
[time=2936] openness and honesty in our relationship, or we're under another person's authority, or we have a moral obligation that we're not keeping, this principle comes right back home that says, "Don't keep a record of wrongs."
[time=2950] I like to phrase it this way, releasing our resentment.
[time=2957] You know, if you get a little splinter in your hand and I get those quite a bit. A lot of times a splinter, it's only about an eighth of an inch long and maybe a 32nd of an inch wide.
[time=2969] It's no big deal. But if it's a left unattended, it'll start to attract moisture around it. That's simply your body trying to insulate itself. That moisture will puff up and it'll be soft and tender to the touch. And if you let that go unattended,
[time=2990] then what will happen in your life is that will become effective and that little puffed up area will turn from white to red.
[time=2999] And if that goes unattended, that red will start to move in a line following your blood system. It will start to poison your whole life.
[time=3008] A little splinter. You see, when an injury comes into our lives emotionally, it's like a little splinter. And if it goes unattended and it's
[time=3019] loud to fester in resentment, it begins to poison our whole body.
[time=3024] Let me give you three reasons why we must release resentment.
[time=3028] The first is this. It clears us emotionally.
[time=3034] Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 15 says this, "See to it that no root of bitterness
[time=3040] spring up in you and by yet many be defiled." You see, an injury comes to you and that injury grows to resentment. That resentment grows to bitterness and that bitterness begins to spill out of our lives and it poisons our relationship with other people.
[time=3056] Whenever you have resentment, ill feelings about another person, those feelings never affect that other person, but they destroy your life. You're the loser whenever you harbor resentment.
[time=3071] Always the loser. In New York City, a man, a millionaire,
[time=3077] by the name of Joseph Richardson, owned a five-foot strip of ground between
[time=3084] two other pieces of property. Wasn't much you could do with a five-foot strip of ground, so he went to one of the neighbors of the adjoining property, and asked him if he'd purchased it. And the man offered a price that Richardson thought was way too low, and he stormed away to the neighbor on the other side. And he offered that man the property, and he equally was interested in buying it, but also offered what Richardson perceived to be too low of price.
[time=3110] They could never agree to a price, and so Richardson grew angry and resentful, and in an attempt to strike out, he built a five-foot wide house on that property and moved into it. And here was a millionaire living in a five-foot wide house as a way of punishing his neighbors and guess who was punished. Can you imagine the imprisoning
[time=3134] effect of living in a house five-foot wide?
[time=3139] You see what bitterness does to us? You see what happens when we hold on to resentment? It doesn't hurt the other person. It poisons us, and many of us have allowed bitterness to fester, and now we're not only poisoned in our own soul, but we're poisoning other people.
[time=3157] Simply because we refuse to forgive and to forget.
[time=3163] We kept the record alive. Second reason why we must forgive and
[time=3169] forget is it not only clears our emotions, but it clears our perspectives. Once you see that somebody's hurt you, if you don't forgive that person every time you'll see that person, you'll think about that person and how they injured you, and it will shape your every perspective of them.
[time=3191] Without getting into any details, there's an individual who owes Kathy and I a sizable amount of money. To you it's not much to us it is.
[time=3198] We're over in the Philippines and we're introduced to a man who has the same last name, and I want to say do you have a cousin back in America? You know when somebody's injured you, there's a tendency that's what you see.
[time=3216] And it distorts our home perspective. We never see the good in that person, we never see their needs, we never see their hurts, their strengths, their resources, their contributions. Many a marriage has been ruined because
[time=3230] somebody was injured and they never stopped seeing their mate except through the bruise of that injury.
[time=3241] Many a family has been destroyed because a child was injured by a word that was spoken by a parent and they never forgave that injury and healed the relationship.
[time=3256] And so the whole perspective is distorted that when I see you I see you the injury.
[time=3263] Third reason is the most important. Not only clears our emotions and not only clears our perspective but it clears our relationship with God.
[time=3273] Most of us here probably every one of us have prayed the Lord's prayer.
[time=3278] Do you know what you told God in that prayer?
[time=3282] We said God forgive me of all my debts, forgive me of all of my sins, my trust passes, forgive me of all the injuries I've done to other people just as I forgive them.
[time=3296] Wow if that's true God still got a big list of things we've done wrong that he can't forgive because we told him just forgive him the way I forgive and we're still harboring the resentment in our hearts. Matthew chapter 5 verse 23 Jesus said if
[time=3314] you come into the temple there to offer the gift your sacrifice your worship and you remember I've injured Joe. I need to go to
[time=3325] Joe and ask Joe's forgiveness then come back and offer my gift or just the same but maybe I remember that Bob has injured me and I'm resenting that and I need to go to Bob and get that right.
[time=3338] Well we're not a temple and we're not offering sacrifices but we today come to God and we offer him our worship and I believe that passage is saying is our worship is not clear the path is blocked between us and God because we're harboring resentment in our lives.
[time=3354] In Matthew chapter 18 there there's a lengthy parable that I
[time=3360] can only state to you in a paraphrased way.
[time=3365] It's called the parable the unmerciful servant. Jesus was asked by his disciples how often do I have to forgive and forget seven times thinking Jesus would say wow if you can forgive seven times you're a super saint go to it. Jesus wasn't so complimentary he said no seven times seventy which is I think 490.
[time=3388] A lot of debate over what that means some say it means if you forgive 490 times by the time it happens again it'll come natural to keep forgiving.
[time=3397] Somebody else said no seven's the perfect number times seventy is infinite. I think the whole point is God expects us always to forgive. Then he gives this parable.
[time=3408] Tells about a man who had many servants one man owed him ten thousand talents.
[time=3414] He came to the man and demanded the debt be paid and the man had no money he pleaded for mercy and he was given mercy.
[time=3421] And that forgiven man rose up one out and bumped into somebody who owed him money and said hey you owe me a great sum of money about a pittance compared to the debt that he was just forgiven and he immediately demanded payment.
[time=3438] And when that got back to his benefactor he was angered and demanded justice. And the whole parable says this God stands ready and willing to forgive us of any and every sin in the cleanses and the washes casted in the seed to remember them no more to separate them from the east and the west. God's saying I'm going to do everything and anything to forgive you and embrace you.
[time=3465] But I expect you then to turn around and to forgive those who've injured you. Well the words of bookkeeping term it's an accounting term and the same word is used not only to describe our relationship to each other but God's relationship to us. In the great ledger of God God has taken all of my sins and he's done a journal transfer and he transferred them under the account of Jesus Christ and he placed all of my sins there. And then he did a second transfer and he took the righteousness of Christ and he imputed. That's our word. He counted them on my side. Jesus.
