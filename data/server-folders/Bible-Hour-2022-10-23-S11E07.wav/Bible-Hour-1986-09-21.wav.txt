[time=8] If you want to fool the world, tell the truth, Otto von Bismarck.
[time=14] The truth, she is only as good as the truth.
[time=18] But a lie, she is as good as you make her, says an old French proverb.
[time=23] Speak the truth in love, the living word of God.
[time=30] [MUSIC]
[time=32] >> Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=37] Today, Rick's message is entitled "Loving the Truth" and is taken from 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=46] The Bible puts a priority on telling the truth and loving the truth.
[time=50] Today, in our study of 1 Corinthians 13, we find that love is not delight and evil,
[time=56] but rejoices with the truth.
[time=60] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=66] We'll be looking at verses 4 through 8.
[time=69] Today's special music will be provided by the Sensuory Choir.
[time=77] We'll also be hearing from Dennis Kirschner and Marsha Ives.
[time=87] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=95] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=98] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=102] Now, here's Rick.
[time=106] The Black Hawk Baptist Church today, we had an exciting service the last hour, and we're thankful to God that He gives us two opportunities on a Sunday morning to worship Him.
[time=116] Thank you for being a part of this opportunity of praise.
[time=120] We also want to welcome our friends who join us for the Bible hour and trust that both for those of us
[time=126] who are here and the others who watch by television, that God will draw each of us closer to Him and draw us ever near to His side.
[time=135] The purpose of our life says the book of Revelation is to praise Him.
[time=138] It says we're made by God for His glory, and He is well pleased when we praise Him.
[time=144] Isaiah the prophet said that God inhabits the praise of His people.
[time=148] Jesus said, "Where two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be in the midst of them.
[time=154] So today we meet in the name of Jesus to praise Him.
[time=158] Our choir leads us in that worship by singing an anthem of praise."
[time=165] [piano music]
[time=172] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=239] [piano music]
[time=245] [MUSIC - 135 seconds]
[time=394] Worship the Lord, O worship the King, all glorious above.
[time=399] Let's continue to do that as we sing together Him number 11.
[time=403] We'll sing all verses together of O worship the King.
[time=408] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=543] One of the great privileges of our church is not only to have an influence for Jesus Christ
[time=549] in Fort Wayne through our church and beyond through our television ministry, but it is our privilege to support over 40 different missionaries who have dotted their way around the globe on all of the major continents.
[time=563] One of the greatest joys though is to have people who come right out of the rows of Blackhawk Baptist Church
[time=570] who will pick up the cross of Christ and carry it on before them as a gracious soldier of the Lord.
[time=577] Ruth Yokem was the first missionary that our church sent out.
[time=581] She went to Bangladesh a number of years ago, came home, and now believes that it is God's will for her to be serving there as a career missionary.
[time=589] So as of January the 1st, 1985, she took up her residence in Bangladesh.
[time=594] She's just home for a few weeks and we wanted to introduce her to you.
[time=598] Welcome her home, and Ruth we're delighted that you're here.
[time=601] And would you please tell our people a little bit about what you've been doing over in Bangladesh and what you hope to do?
[time=608] It's a real pleasure for me to be here this morning.
[time=612] For 19 of the last 20 months I've been involved in studying the Bengali language.
[time=617] The Lord helped me to move through the program and to finish in a satisfactory way.
[time=622] In August I was able to change my residence and move from Dhaka the capital city down to our hospital location
[time=629] and now I'm on vacation.
[time=632] Well you have a well-deserved vacation after 19 months of language school.
[time=637] Ruth is associated with ABWE and we have two other missionary couples doing the similar type of work that Ruth is engaging in.
[time=645] Larry and Nancy Allen and Bob and Jimmy Nuska and through your work with them in contact, how is the work of evangelism going there?
[time=656] I was in Bangladesh as a short term and then a number of years later I returned to the country and I was really excited to see what was happening.
[time=667] The Lord has raised up Bengali pastors, Bengali evangelists, he has brought men to our Bible Institute training program
[time=676] and although progress is slow, I believe progress has been made over the years and it's exciting to see the Lord work.
[time=684] Well that's good news when we've heard through you and the Allen's of people like him.
[time=689] Am I saying his name right, Ojoy?
[time=691] Ojoy.
[time=692] Ojoy, that's exactly what I thought it was.
[time=694] Ojoy is a Bengali man who has really taken the call of the Lord so seriously and been a powerful influence there.
[time=702] Tell us Ruth, what can we pray for in your life and in the work of the lives of the missionaries and nationals in Bangladesh?
[time=711] I would appreciate if you would pray for me that I would be diligent as I finish my language study.
[time=718] I have a special language project to do when I get back but the thing that is going on my heart mostly for prayer
[time=727] is that you pray for the Bengali believers and also pray for a new pastor who is pastoring the Dampara Baptist Church in Chinnagon.
[time=738] Thank you Ruth and we will pray for those and would you bow with us as we pray?
[time=743] God we are so thankful for Ruth and Bobby and Jimmy Nuskin, Larry and Nancy Allen who are working in Bangladesh
[time=751] for Mary who has been serving in Japan for these years and Denny and Debbie Howard in Germany who are home studying.
[time=759] Mike and Carolyn who are with us this year as they return from the Philippines and Lori Sell as she goes there this year
[time=766] for Ken and Alice as they plan a church and for the 35 believers who attended on the first Sunday in Quezon City.
[time=774] God we are thrilled and today we want to especially pray for the pastors and the national believers of Bangladesh
[time=781] that you would fortify their hearts with courage and give them a holy boldness in Christ
[time=787] so that they like Paul with all boldness might speak the word with all truth and sincerity.
[time=793] God thank you for the privilege that is ours of supporting Ruth and encouragement through prayer.
[time=799] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=802] We have asked Dennis Kirschner today to lead us in music.
[time=806] Many of you carry a heavy heart.
[time=809] Some of you are going through some deep times of physical need, family need, broken relationships
[time=816] but the Lord Jesus promises he will walk alongside of you and he will be your friend.
[time=821] He will walk with you in the lonely moments of the garden Dennis ministers to us of that truth and song.
[time=851] In the rose he hears, and the voice I hear falling on my ear, the son of God discloses.
[time=875] He speaks, and the sound of his voice is so sweet that the birds hush their singing.
[time=893] And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing.
[time=911] And he talks with me, and he tells me I am his own.
[time=931] And the joy we share as we carry there, none other has ever known.
[time=955] Rented Jesus is my plea.
[time=966] Death in my feet was with me.
[time=976] Let it be, dear Lord, let it be, let it be.
[time=990] Let it be, what a friend we have in Jesus.
[time=1009] All our sins and dreams to bear.
[time=1020] What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer.
[time=1041] No one is the oven for fair.
[time=1051] All our people's pain we bear.
[time=1062] All because we do not care be everything to God in prayer.
[time=1080] Take it to the room in prayer.
[time=1106] I hope that today's broadcast has already been an encouragement to you.
[time=1111] In a few moments we'll go back to our worship service, but right now we wanted to take a few moments to encourage you and inform you about some other opportunities.
[time=1121] Joining Pete and me today is George Lantman, one of our pastors who is in charge of our senior adult ministry.
[time=1127] Good morning, George.
[time=1128] Good morning, Rick.
[time=1129] Super 60s anniversary is coming up in about two weeks, tell our viewers just a little bit about the dates and the special things that are coming.
[time=1137] Yes, I'd like to, Rick.
[time=1139] October the third will be our eighth anniversary, and we're looking for 700 people to come on that day.
[time=1145] We have Jay Kessler, the president of Taylor University coming, and Joyce Lantman is going to be singing, and we're just looking for a great time.
[time=1153] We're having dignitaries come from the local area, and we're going to just have a great time there, so we're inviting all the people who can to come on October the third at 10 a.m. in the morning.
[time=1164] We do serve a lunch, like Rick, and of course it's always a good lunch, and we're just going to have a great anniversary that day.
[time=1172] You mentioned dignitaries.
[time=1173] You were speaking of Pete and I, of course, but yes, you're invited too.
[time=1177] George was serious when he said some of the local officials will be coming, and many of you may remember Jay Kessler.
[time=1185] He spoke here on the Bible Hour and in our church back in the early weeks of June, and many of you wrote in and told us what a tremendous ministry he had to you.
[time=1195] As a matter of fact, we probably had more encouragement over his ministry than any of the guests we've had in in a long time.
[time=1201] He's a very gifted communicator, and we want to encourage you to come.
[time=1205] The date again is October the third at 10 a.m. in the morning.
[time=1211] Good. Well, George has been a faithful partner here in the ministry, and senior adult ministry is only part of his work, but this is probably the highlight of the year for our senior adult fellowship called Super Sixties, and we'd love to have you join us for that event.
[time=1226] Pete would like to tell you about timeless insights, an important Bible study tool that's available to you.
[time=1233] Rick, I suppose we've all asked the question many times. Have I read the Bible through?
[time=1238] And I'm asking you that question today. Have you read the entire Bible through, and perhaps even in one year?
[time=1244] Well, I want to encourage you to do that. This is the fall season, and we often hear of the kickoff, as we did yesterday in many of the ballgames that were on television, and I'm saying let's kick off in our Bible reading right now.
[time=1257] October 1st is the beginning of a series from Timeless Insights reading through the Bible.
[time=1263] We begin with the New Testament, and you get a certain amount of reading for each day.
[time=1268] It's not a great amount, but as you read every day and you're faithful, by the end of the year, you will have gone through the entire Bible.
[time=1276] I want to encourage you to write today for Timeless Insights so that you can begin your reading on October 1st.
[time=1282] You can receive Timeless Insights by writing to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1292] Let me encourage you to write today so that you can begin with the rest of us in reading through the Bible in one year.
[time=1298] I would like to add my encouragement right alongside of Pete's that you can grow only through God's Word, and you can only grasp God's Word if you're consistently studying it.
[time=1310] All of us need some help. I need that help, even though my education focuses in on the Bible.
[time=1316] We'd love to send you a copy, so please do write today and request Timeless Insights.
[time=1321] Again, our address is the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1331] Well, last few weeks we've mentioned to you that we're embarking on a great adventure here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1338] By God's grace, we hope to be building a new sanctuary beginning in the spring.
[time=1343] Right now, we're a part of the capital funds drive to raise the finances necessary for that new sanctuary.
[time=1350] The new sanctuary will also be at the home of the Bible hour.
[time=1353] And while we mention this in the weeks past, we've had a tremendous response of people asking about the new building and one family made an enormous contribution simply by hearing it on this broadcast.
[time=1364] So we want to thank you for your letters, your encouragement, and of course for your financial support, both for the Church and the Bible hour.
[time=1372] If you would like to write us, please do. That's such an encouragement. Finally, our address again, the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1386] George and Pete, thank you for being a part of these brief moments.
[time=1389] And now as we go back to our morning worship service, we hope that your heart is open to the Ministry of Music and to God's Word.
[time=1402] [MUSIC]
[time=1409] I've no regrets that I said yes to Jesus.
[time=1418] That when he called, I answered him that day.
[time=1427] I've no regrets that I became a Christian and turned from sin to walk the narrow way.
[time=1444] No regrets, no regrets. For the cup of wine, these filled up to the brim.
[time=1463] Sweet peace is mine, and joy that can't be measured.
[time=1471] I've no regrets, I chose to follow him.
[time=1479] [MUSIC]
[time=1489] I've no regrets, I left my old companions, who scorn the Lord and live for things of earth.
[time=1506] I've no regrets that now I'm serving Jesus.
[time=1515] To me his friendship is a greater word.
[time=1524] I've no regrets, I've suffered some for Jesus.
[time=1532] Have known some pain, have wept some bitter tears.
[time=1541] I've no regrets for when and how he's led me.
[time=1550] To trust his will removes my doubts and fears.
[time=1558] No regrets, I've no regrets.
[time=1567] It's been heaven just to walk with image day.
[time=1576] And besides, when face to face up there I see him.
[time=1584] All the trials of life and labor he'll repay.
[time=1596] I've no regrets, I chose to follow him.
[time=1615] [MUSIC]
[time=1626] Thank you, Marsha.
[time=1628] William Borden left the New England states to go to India to be a missionary.
[time=1634] He stopped in Egypt and there contracted a disease that would ultimately take his life.
[time=1640] He was never even able to leave Egypt, but he said in his dying words, "No reserve, no retreat, no regrets."
[time=1651] God, today we know that there is a price to be paid in coming to Christ.
[time=1656] Your word reminds us that we should count the costs before we say yes to Christ.
[time=1663] Yet God, we are so overwhelmed with the blessing and the benefit that we have no regrets.
[time=1669] Father, we pray for those parts of the body today, those members who have suffered rejection from family
[time=1677] or employers or fellow laborers because of their commitment to Christ.
[time=1683] We pray that you'll encourage them and give them a gracious boldness.
[time=1688] Father, we pray for believers whose spouses have rejected them because of their commitment to Christ,
[time=1695] that you would give them a joy in spite of the circumstances.
[time=1700] Father, we would pray today that you would help us to live with such a confidence in you we would say no regrets.
[time=1708] Father, we would pray today for those members of our fellowship who are suffering.
[time=1714] We pray for Harry Blosford in particular and others who are fighting against cancer.
[time=1721] We pray for those friends who right now are going through days of fear, not knowing what disease it is that has attacked their body, particularly for Marv Degas.
[time=1731] We would ask for wisdom for his doctors and we rejoice at just a slight improvement in a hand.
[time=1738] Father, today, we would also pray for those people who are facing deep, deep loneliness,
[time=1746] that you would not only be their companion, that you would bring friends into their life.
[time=1751] We pray particularly for the elderly and the shut-ins who sometimes go so long without a contact
[time=1758] that you would give to their family and their friends' sensitivity.
[time=1763] Father, today, we would pray that you would direct our lives, that we might please you and give us a hunger to please you more than anything else.
[time=1774] [AMEN] Open your Bibles, please, to 1 Corinthians chapter 13, and verses 4 through 8 are a point of study for a number of weeks as we go through a biblical description of love.
[time=1789] Verse 4 says, "Love is patient. Love is kind.
[time=1794] It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud.
[time=1800] It is not rude. It is not self-seeking.
[time=1805] It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs.
[time=1810] Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[time=1817] It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
[time=1828] Love never fails.
[time=1833] Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[time=1839] That's the phrase that we'll look at and we'll study today.
[time=1842] And while we think of that, can I ask you, what is it that you've developed an appetite for?
[time=1848] What is it that your taste buds are particularly fond of?
[time=1851] For me, it's Mexican Italian food, the hotter the better.
[time=1856] What is it that you like?
[time=1858] What is it that you've developed an appetite for?
[time=1861] What are the things that get you excited about lunch or dinner?
[time=1865] Now, don't get too involved with thinking about lunch.
[time=1868] Now, let's get back to 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=1870] I see some of you beginning to salivate.
[time=1873] Others of your wives are going, "Huh, it's not what you think it is." As most of you know, Kathy and I had the privilege of going on a missions trip.
[time=1882] And amongst other places we visited was Japan.
[time=1886] We learned a lot about Japanese life and culture and Japanese people and religion and geography.
[time=1893] But there's not anything that's stuck in our minds more than Japanese food.
[time=1898] Let me ask you, have you ever just savored long on your taste buds, the delightful experience
[time=1904] of raw carp?
[time=1906] Have you ever had, oh, it's good stuff.
[time=1908] It's a lot better than marinated jellyfish.
[time=1911] Have you ever had your dinner spread around in beautiful colors and arrangements and asked,
[time=1919] what is that attractive looking yellowish ones ball?
[time=1924] Oh, that is the three-day ripe egg yolk.
[time=1927] You'll like it.
[time=1928] Very good.
[time=1930] Have you ever eaten your fish wondering if he was dead?
[time=1938] Well, that meal that I just described was not your typical Japanese meal.
[time=1943] That was your really nice Japanese dinner.
[time=1946] I mean, those were the meals they really looked forward to.
[time=1950] I look forward to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[time=1954] And to find a set of golden arches in the middle of Kofu, Japan was a delightful experience.
[time=1963] My taste buds and their taste buds were not similarly trained.
[time=1968] But a sweet moment of opportunity came when two Japanese girls this past August came to stay with us, and we treated katsumi and masako to French fries, deep fried and animal fat,
[time=1981] to help get your cholesterol count up.
[time=1985] And they looked at the pizza that we got them at Pizza Hut as though they were saying, is it dead or is it alive?
[time=1994] Their taste buds were trained completely different than ours.
[time=1998] What have you trained your spiritual taste buds to like?
[time=2003] What is it that you hunger for spiritually?
[time=2007] And when you taste it, you say, that's good stuff.
[time=2012] What is it that when it comes into your life spiritually, you say, this is foreign.
[time=2018] I mean, this is really foreign stuff.
[time=2023] That's why Jesus said, "Blessed," that word "beatus" means happy.
[time=2028] Happy is the man, blessed is the man or woman who hungers and thirsts for righteousness.
[time=2037] What are you hungry for today?
[time=2041] True love that comes from the Heavenly Father and then fills the life of a believer
[time=2047] is a love that on one hand does not delight in evil, but in distinction to that rejoices
[time=2058] with the truth.
[time=2062] Trying to analyze both the scriptures and our society, what is it that would be representative of delighting in evil?
[time=2070] Let me just give you at least these three examples of what our society does, I fear is really in danger of God's wrath.
[time=2078] The first is probably the most simple, the most subtle.
[time=2081] It is the delight in receiving and transmitting gossip.
[time=2087] Most of us are guilty of being like a relay station that picks up the radio signal that comes from here and receives it and then re-broadcasts it further.
[time=2098] We're like the satellite that there's a beam that goes up and then it shoots it down to make sure the signal gets broader coverage.
[time=2108] The Bible and the book of Proverbs particularly talks about the one whose lips are perverse and who is quick to spread evil about another.
[time=2117] And don't let us think that gossip means telling something that is either untrue or unsubstantiated.
[time=2124] You can gossip and be speaking the absolute perfect truth, but with no spiritually minded purpose.
[time=2135] There's something about us in our humanity, and I'm going to blame it on Adam that we've inherited it,
[time=2142] that we almost rejoice when somebody else suffers.
[time=2149] Why is it that some churches and particularly pastors find it almost encouraging that another church is struggling?
[time=2157] Why is it that we feel better when somebody else is doing worse?
[time=2163] It's because we quite often have an inferiority complex.
[time=2169] We don't feel like we're measuring up to what we ought to be, and when we find out somebody else is doing worse we start feeling better about ourselves.
[time=2179] And we almost rejoice at the news of gossip.
[time=2182] We take delight in that.
[time=2185] I sat with a teenage girl some time ago now who said, "Why is it that the people who said they were my friends were so quick to believe a lie about me
[time=2197] and to tell everybody else?" The Bible says we need to rejoice with those who rejoice and to mourn with those who mourn.
[time=2206] Let's confess it's a lot easier to mourn with the mourners than it is to rejoice with the joyful.
[time=2215] There's even a greater danger than that.
[time=2219] That is delighting in evil, I believe, is also the product not only of receiving and transmitting gossip,
[time=2225] but it is the desensitizing of the modern media.
[time=2232] Remember back to our childhood days those of us who are still in our thirties.
[time=2239] Older people I'm sure will remember them as my parents remember me watching television.
[time=2246] Do you remember the heroes of the 1950s allow me to address my favorite, the Lone Ranger?
[time=2253] Remember the mask?
[time=2255] Silver bullet?
[time=2257] Faithful companion Tano?
[time=2259] He rode scout?
[time=2260] Lone Ranger rode silver?
[time=2262] It wasn't much of a TV show, it was the same every week.
[time=2266] Lone Ranger would ride past this big rock.
[time=2269] It was in every television, it rode by the same rock and he'd say, "Tano, meet me at the old hideout." They'd go to this cabin.
[time=2275] Next show, meet me at the old minor shack, same cabin.
[time=2278] They didn't even change the curtains.
[time=2280] They'd meet me and it was always the same place, but there were two other things that were always the same about that show.
[time=2289] There was always the moral distinction between right and wrong.
[time=2296] It was always there.
[time=2298] I remember watching it just a few months ago and laughing because I knew I didn't understand that at eight years old, but at the end of the show the Lone Ranger turns to Tano and says, "Tano, his greed was his undoing, kimosabi." I never caught that stuff 20 years ago, but there was that clearness.
[time=2318] This is right and this is wrong.
[time=2321] The Lone Ranger never shot anybody.
[time=2323] He shot the gun out of their hand every time.
[time=2325] That's pretty good shooting.
[time=2327] It was always clear, right and wrong, and there was always humility.
[time=2336] The show always ended.
[time=2338] People marveling, who was that masked man?
[time=2342] Why, and today he would have jumped them and said, "It's me." Number one, the greatest, but instead he just humbly rode away and somebody in the background would say,
[time=2353] "Why, that was the Lone Ranger." And in "Kits the William Tell Overture," and we waited another week until he rode again.
[time=2362] And that television show would end, as every other television show with a little logo that came up and it said,
[time=2369] "This television station adheres to the code of ethics and good conduct."
[time=2376] Now, let's review television.
[time=2379] You know who has replaced the Lone Ranger?
[time=2382] Dirty Harry.
[time=2384] Somebody who is violent, who is vulgar, and who is immoral.
[time=2390] And that's the hero of today.
[time=2396] I have had the privilege of teaching at one of the public high schools every year that I've been here, both semesters, and we're into our tenth year here in Fort Wayne.
[time=2405] It's unsexinating and I've asked the question amongst the high school students, secular high school students,
[time=2411] would you agree with me that most of the music on the radio is overt in its sexuality and its violence?
[time=2418] They all started laughing.
[time=2420] One wise guy in the back of the room said, "No, all of it is." And they totally agreed.
[time=2427] Isaiah the prophet, Isaiah 5, verse 20 says, "Woe unto him who calls evil good and good evil."
[time=2438] That is what has happened in our society today.
[time=2442] There is no longer any clarity over right and wrong.
[time=2447] Picked up the newspaper this week, Monday morning.
[time=2451] Leaved through the paper and found an article, talked about teenage sexuality and it looked like the article was learning to say no.
[time=2459] And I was excited about that article and I wonder what believer somehow snuck something into the paper.
[time=2466] But as I read the article, it was basically saying, don't let anybody pressure you into sex.
[time=2472] Say no until you want to say yes and then say yes.
[time=2477] What a vague situational approach to morality.
[time=2481] It's okay to do anything you want to do as long as you want to do it.
[time=2486] And our whole society has become desensitized.
[time=2493] And perhaps the most obnoxious thing in the sight of our God is just the simple honor of his own name.
[time=2506] Whether you agree that this four letter word is crude and this one is immoral and forget that whole discussion,
[time=2514] to ever punctuate our anger with the name of the one who died on the cross for our sins
[time=2521] is absolutely to degrade the cross on which he died and say it's a point of humor.
[time=2527] It's a point of mockery. It's a point of spite.
[time=2531] And yet can I be honest with you, I don't even sense it anymore.
[time=2536] It's so common, my ears don't even notice it.
[time=2540] We become a society that has learned to delight in evil.
[time=2548] There are some real dangers in that learning to delight in evil.
[time=2553] Let me give you these three dangers.
[time=2555] First of all, it is an affront to the very character of God.
[time=2561] The Bible says, "I am holy," says the Lord God of Host.
[time=2568] "Be ye therefore holy as I am holy," 1 Peter 1, 15.
[time=2574] God himself is holy. And Habakkah 2 says that he is of such purity
[time=2580] that he cannot look with any sense of approval on iniquity.
[time=2585] Secondly, it's a crime to delight in evil as much as it is to commit evil.
[time=2595] Back in Romans, it gives the descent of humanity in Romans 1.
[time=2602] And verse 32 ends with this statement, "Although they knew God's righteous decree
[time=2611] that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, and they'll note this,
[time=2622] but also approve of those who practice them."
[time=2629] Saying it is not only wrong for us to commit evil, it is just as wrong to stand by and say,
[time=2635] "Hey, if it's okay for you, it's okay," and they'll give approval to those who do wrong.
[time=2643] And finally, it contributes to the absolute decay and destruction of a society.
[time=2648] Listen to what the proverbs say. Proverbs 24 verse 24.
[time=2654] Whoever says to the guilty, "You are innocent." People's will curse him and nations denounce him. Proverbs 28 and verse 4.
[time=2666] "Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them."
[time=2674] Righteousness, exultination, but sin is a reproach to any people.
[time=2680] You see, in our society, because we have been desensitized and our society has developed an appetite for wickedness, now our whole society is crumbling and decaying.
[time=2696] You know, it's a shame that if we're going to listen to the secularists, that we don't listen to the secularists, because they're warning us of their evil.
[time=2707] One of the most popular songs, if not the most popular song of 1986 says, "Well, you might as well face it. You're addicted to love." Now, if you're going to listen to that, listen to it, because they're the secularists who are saying that sex is addicting.
[time=2724] And if you think that you can just indulge in pornography and not become addicted to it, you're as foolish as the man who takes narcotics and says, "I can quit."
[time=2734] You might as well face it. You're addicted to love.
[time=2739] If we're going to listen to them, then let's listen to them.
[time=2743] They're telling us, they're beating the drums of evil, and they'll capture us and lead us away into slavery of sin.
[time=2754] Well, it's pretty strong stuff, isn't it? Not to delight an evil.
[time=2760] But you know, along with saying no to immorality, and no to vulgarity,
[time=2767] and no to the glorification of violence, and no to pornography.
[time=2772] What do we say yes to? It's not enough to say, "Don't eat cholesterol.
[time=2778] Don't eat fatty foods. Don't eat too much sugar. It'll make you hyper." We've got to say, "What do you eat? What's the healthy stuff?" And there's the balance of God's word. It says, "True love does not delight in evil,
[time=2793] but it rejoices with the truth." Wouldn't it be frustrating if you wanted to know
[time=2801] the answer to a mathematical problem in the teacher or professor begin by telling you everything that's not the answer? Hey, Prof, what is the mathematical equation for pie?
[time=2812] Professor says, "Well, it's not 3.2. It's not 3.3. It's not 3.4. It's not 4.0. It's not 5.0.
[time=2818] It's not anywhere close to 10. You know, that could go on forever.
[time=2822] What is it? 3.1416. Boom, that's it.
[time=2827] You know what God does to us? He not only says, "Stay away from this. Stay away." But he says, "Take this. Eat it. Develop a taste for it. Rejoice with the truth."
[time=2838] Now, that word "truth" has three different unique definitions in the Scripture, and let's apply all three of them. The first thing that truth refers to in the Bible is a delight and a love for integrity. Ralph Waldo Emerson said,
[time=2854] "A little integrity is better than a great career." J.R. Ewing says, "Once you give up integrity, everything else goes easy. Integrity."
[time=2868] Bret Hart wrote some of the greatest short stories about the American West.
[time=2873] Constantly in his writing, he used this phrase, "In the Old West, a man's word was his bond."
[time=2881] That meant you could trust a man at what he said, integrity, honesty, truth.
[time=2890] Mark Twain, the humorist, warned us that it's always best when in doubt to tell the truth.
[time=2898] Otto von Bismarck said, "Tell the truth. It will shock the world."
[time=2904] And then there's this old French proverb, "The truth. She is only as good as the truth, but lies as good as you make it." Now listen to what God says. Proverbs chapter 11.
[time=2920] Proverbs chapter 11 and verse 3.
[time=2927] "The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity." Proverbs 19 verse 1. "Better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse." Ephesians chapter 4 verses 15 and 25.
[time=2952] Speaking the truth to one another in love.
[time=2957] Thomas Fuller said, "Honesty is a fine jewel, but much out of fashion."
[time=2966] It's always easier to tell a lie than to openly surrender to the consequences of the truth.
[time=2980] But truth and time go hand in hand, and the consequences of the lie found out are far greater than the truth one told.
[time=2991] And truth and time always go hand in hand.
[time=2997] Someone who loves God and who is filled with God's love finds the truth a natural delight in their life.
[time=3010] But there's a second meaning of truth. Jesus said in John chapter 17 verse 17, He said,
[time=3016] "Father, speaking of His disciples, sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth."
[time=3026] And one of the most important things, if not the most important thing we can do in our spiritual life is to learn to love God's Word.
[time=3033] Psalm 19 speaks with beauty and simplicity about loving God's Word. Listen to Psalm 19 verses 7 through 11.
[time=3044] The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
[time=3052] The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart, joy to the heart.
[time=3059] The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes. The fear of the Lord is pure enduring forever.
[time=3066] The ordinances of the Lord are sure and altogether righteous. They are more precious than gold, yea than much fine gold.
[time=3075] And now notice this, and they are sweeter than honey, and the honey of the honeycomb.
[time=3082] And by them is your servant warned, and in keeping them there is great reward.
[time=3088] What are you hungry for today? I hope that you have found that the Word of God is sweet, and its sweetness will strengthen your life.
[time=3097] Jeremiah the prophet said these words, "When your words came unto me I did eat them, and I found them to be my joy and my heart's delight."
[time=3109] Turn in your Bible, if you will, to Psalm chapter 1. Psalm chapter 1 I believe gives us a root philosophy of life.
[time=3118] So important is this psalm that I'd like to ask each of you to do something this week. That would be to memorize this 6 verse psalm.
[time=3126] Many of you have already done that, but many of us have not. I'd like to ask you to memorize this in the King James Version.
[time=3133] That way we're all memorizing it the same, and next week we'll stand together and say it.
[time=3138] Some of you just leaned over and said, "We'll go to the lake next week." You can learn 6 verses in 7 days, can't you? Sure you can. Why not make it a purpose this week that each day at some point during the day at a dinner time that the family would sit down together and practice this psalm.
[time=3157] Listen to it. Make it your philosophy of life.
[time=3160] Blessed is the man who does not walk in the council of the wicked, or stand in the way of sinners, or sit in the seat of the markers.
[time=3169] Do you see the progression of Hebrew poetry there? It says, "You don't even walk by it. You stay out of that neighborhood."
[time=3176] And if you ever happen to be in that neighborhood, you don't stop and stand around, and you certainly don't sit.
[time=3183] There's a total avoidance there, but in contrast to all that, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night.
[time=3198] He is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in its season, whose leaf does not wither whatever he does prospers.
[time=3207] Here's the individual who says, "I not only stay away from this, but I find delight. I love it. The Word of God that it feeds me and strengthens my life."
[time=3220] Not so the wicked verse for, they're like chaff, that the wind blows away. Therefore, the wicked will not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
[time=3233] For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the path of the way of the wicked will perish.
[time=3240] I don't know of a greater principle for us to put in our life than Psalm 1, to be rooted and founded by delighting in the Word of God.
[time=3250] Psalm 119 verses 14 to 16, just supplement all of this.
[time=3256] I rejoice in following your statutes as one rejoices in great riches. How many of you open the mailbox with almost a sense of disappointment because you know that you'll fish out a variety of bills and there's no purpose to hope that in that mail will come great riches?
[time=3278] Mondays are nobody's favorite day of the week, at least anybody that I've talked to. Last Monday we had an unusual phone call.
[time=3286] A lady who had visited our church quite often but was really not a regular part of our church called and said, "How much is the new building going to cost?"
[time=3297] So I told her three and a half million dollars at least. She said, "Would twenty thousand dollars help?"
[time=3303] I said, "Well, I think that just might help." I said, "That's really generous of you and your husband to give that kind of gift." She said, "Oh no, this is my money. He's going to do something on his own."
[time=3314] I thought, "Man, this is a good Monday. I can't wait till tomorrow." You see that level of excitement that was contagious with you when somebody said, "Great riches."
[time=3326] Congratulations. You've just won the reader's digest sweepstakes. Here's a picture of your new house.
[time=3333] Good news. You know Uncle Herbie that you never met? He remembered you and his will.
[time=3341] Now look at this psalm in light of all that. I rejoice in your statutes as one, rejoices and great riches.
[time=3350] You know, there's value and there's preciousness in the Word of God that can build your life.
[time=3357] And you can find joy in this far more than you can in great riches.
[time=3362] Uncle Henry was a very wealthy man, very wealthy.
[time=3367] Uncle Henry started a company and he named it after himself, Ford.
[time=3373] When Uncle Henry came to his nephew's wedding, he gave a very nice gift, a Bible.
[time=3381] A little bit disappointing to the nephew who expected a little more from Uncle Henry.
[time=3386] Over a year later, Uncle Henry came to his nephew's house and said, "How do you like that wedding gift?"
[time=3393] "Oh, we like that, Uncle Henry. We really like that wedding gift. Can I see it?" Little Fear went over their faces and they began to scramble around back closets and finally produced Uncle Henry's gift, that lovely Bible.
[time=3406] He opened it up and took out of its page as a check that he had left there.
[time=3411] It's been a privilege to be in your home through the medium of television today, sharing with you the ministry of music from our church musicians and the message from the Word of God from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3422] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, let's take a minute before we close and pray together.
[time=3430] Will you pray this prayer with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3439] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3442] I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3446] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3450] We are always pleased when we hear decisions that are made through the Bible hour.
[time=3454] If you've made a decision this week, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
