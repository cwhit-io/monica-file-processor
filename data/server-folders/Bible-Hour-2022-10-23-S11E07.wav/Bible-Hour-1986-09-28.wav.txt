[time=90] (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres,
[time=119] love says it's too soon to quit.
[time=123] (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=137] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=139] Today, Rick's message is entitled, "Rejoice with the Truth" and is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=147] In our marriage, at work, with our children, or while working on our favorite project, we often feel the urge to say, "I quit." Today, as we study 1 Corinthians 13, we will discover it is too soon to quit.
[time=162] So that you are able to study with us, please locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=169] We will be looking at verses 4 through 8.
[time=173] Special music for today's service will be provided by the sanctuary choir.
[time=178] We'll also be hearing from the ladies' ensemble, and Scott Schindler.
[time=186] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=195] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=200] Now, here's Rick.
[time=205] It is a joy to welcome you today to our morning worship service and also to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=214] Pete Coby is in Oregon.
[time=216] This weekend, his oldest child, who's not a child, Lisa's 22 years old, was married on the weekend and they're out there rejoicing together with old friends after the wedding.
[time=228] Pete and Carol will be back in the middle of the week, and we certainly appreciate Ron leading the choir in our singing, and we appreciate that each of you are here and you're joining us for a time of praise and a Bible study.
[time=240] Our choirs work very hard, and I had the privilege that you didn't have of being here in the last hour, and as they minister to music, I really sense the Spirit of God working in this congregation to quiet our hearts, to humbles before the Lord, and to sit in His presence in awe.
[time=257] Thank you, choir, for your hard work and for your worship with us, and now as they lead us, let us focus our attention on the eternal, loving Father of God, to whom we give glory.
[time=283] [MUSIC - 247 seconds]
[time=548] [AMEN] Turn your hymnals now to number seven.
[time=553] Love divine, all loves excelling.
[time=556] Joy of heaven to earth come down.
[time=558] Fixing us thy humble dwelling.
[time=561] All thy faithful mercies crown.
[time=564] Number seven in your hymnal. Shall we stand as we sing?
[time=567] [MUSIC]
[time=616] On the third and the last dances.
[time=619] [MUSIC]
[time=639] Shall we return to heaven?
[time=648] [MUSIC]
[time=674] Shall we return to heaven?
[time=688] [MUSIC]
[time=704] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=706] I looked out and saw mostly familiar faces,
[time=713] but a few new faces this morning.
[time=715] Let me just ask a few questions.
[time=717] How many of you were here with us last week?
[time=720] Would you just raise your hand if you were here with us last week?
[time=723] Oh, that's the majority.
[time=725] No, just keep your hands up there, okay?
[time=727] Now, how many of you did your homework from last week and memorize Psalm 1?
[time=731] And the hands began to sing.
[time=733] Well, we're going to give you a week of grace, but open your Bible, if you will, to Psalm 1, and we as a congregation are going to read that, or if you haven't memorized, please say that Psalm from memory.
[time=746] We're memorizing that short six verse Psalm.
[time=750] Why memorize the Bible?
[time=752] Isn't that somewhat childish or even infantile?
[time=755] Isn't that what we do with the little ones down there in the nursery?
[time=758] Yes, it is, but just because we do it with the little ones down in the nursery doesn't mean that those of us who are big ones down here in the auditorium don't need to memorize God's word.
[time=769] David said, "Thy word have I hid in my heart." Why?
[time=774] That I might not sin against thee.
[time=776] I know many of you ladies here probably never played football, but you'll probably follow this illustration, the men will.
[time=783] If you don't know the plays, it's really tough to play on the football team.
[time=788] When you go into that huddle and the quarterback says, "We're going to run a right 44 option past." You can't say, "What's that mean?" You've got to walk up there because in 20 seconds they're going to hike that ball and you've got to know what to do.
[time=800] You know, sometimes in life you don't have time.
[time=803] You've got to know the plays.
[time=805] And when you're facing a temptation or a trial or an adversity or an opportunity to speak a word for Christ, you can't say, "Can't remember the verses." We've got to have God's word hidden in our heart.
[time=818] Psalm 1 is a game plan for life.
[time=821] If you have your Bible, please read it.
[time=823] If you know it by memory, say it out loud.
[time=825] We're using the King James Version simply because that's what most of us have.
[time=829] If you have something different, you mutter along, okay?
[time=833] Psalm 1 verse 1.
[time=835] "Blessed is the man." Oh, you don't know it.
[time=839] Let's start over.
[time=840] Now you have to carry that.
[time=841] "Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful.
[time=853] His delight is in law of the Lord, and in his law does he?
[time=858] A in night.
[time=860] He shall be like the tree planted by the rivers of water, that bring forth his fruit in his season.
[time=868] We also shall not wither, and whatsoever he do it shall prosper.
[time=874] Then godly or not so, they are chapped.
[time=879] When driveth away, therefore godly, shall not stand in the dead, nor siteth in the congregation of Christ.
[time=890] For the Lord knows the way of righteous, and the way of God we shall perish."
[time=897] Boy, you did a good job there.
[time=899] I have stopped to make sure you weren't just humming along with me.
[time=902] Many of you memorize that.
[time=904] And I hope this next week you'll sit down and take that passage again and memorize it and make it a game plan.
[time=910] Do you know that little assignment did so much for Kathy?
[time=913] You know, we found ourselves, I can't quite say daily.
[time=916] There was at least one day we didn't.
[time=918] But we began last Sunday and Monday, and last night before we went to bed, we were scrambling, getting that sixth verse down.
[time=926] What an adventure, though, as a couple, to say, we'll memorize God's word together and teach it to our children.
[time=932] God's word repeatedly speaks of his grace, and our ladies' ensemble is now going to sing for us of God's grace that he gives, and he gives, and he gives again.
[time=970] He said that for strength, when the labors increase,
[time=978] to add an affliction, he added his mercy,
[time=986] to vaulted light trials, his vaulted light means.
[time=994] His love has no limit, his grace has no measure.
[time=1002] He was far as no boundary known unto men.
[time=1011] For out of his infinite riches in Jesus,
[time=1021] he gave birth, and gave birth, and gave birth again.
[time=1031] When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
[time=1039] when our strength has failed and the days have come,
[time=1047] when we reached the end of our horn and resources,
[time=1055] our fathers' full giving is only begun.
[time=1063] For his love has no limit, his grace has no measure.
[time=1071] His heart has no boundary known unto men.
[time=1080] For out of his infinite riches in Jesus.
[time=1092] Give birth, give birth, and give birth again,
[time=1106] and again, and again, and again.
[time=1122] Thank you again for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1128] Ron Hackett is filling in for Pete Coby.
[time=1131] Pete's in Oregon this weekend celebrating a great event in the life of his family.
[time=1136] His oldest child, Lisa, has been married on Friday night, and they're out there visiting family and friends in Dubac tomorrow.
[time=1144] With me today is George Lantman, one of our pastors, who's in charge of pastoral care and a senior adult fellowship called Super Sixties.
[time=1152] Good morning, George.
[time=1153] Good morning, Rick.
[time=1154] This coming Friday is a big day for Super Sixties.
[time=1156] Yes, it is, Rick.
[time=1158] It's the eighth anniversary.
[time=1159] Well, I'm looking forward to that, and Jay Kessler being here, but I'll bet most of our people aren't familiar with Jay.
[time=1165] Probably not.
[time=1166] He's the president of Taylor University and probably better known for his ministry at Youth of Christ.
[time=1171] And he has a daily radio broadcast here in Fort Wayne with WBCL called Family Form, and I enjoy hearing that.
[time=1178] Yes, I listen to that many times.
[time=1180] Well, this Friday is Super Sixties' eighth anniversary.
[time=1183] How many people are we expecting?
[time=1185] Well, Rick, we're praying and hoping and trusting God for 700 people.
[time=1189] Well, I think that that's a reasonable goal to hope for 700 people.
[time=1194] Super Sixties began eight years ago with 35 people, so that would be about a 2,000 percent increase in eight years.
[time=1201] I haven't figured it out yet, but probably you're right.
[time=1203] Well, I just did that in my head, and I'm not sure it's right either, so if you can correct that right in and let us know.
[time=1208] Give our viewers some of the times and details like that for this weekend.
[time=1212] Yes, I would like to invite all those in the audience to the Super Sixties' eighth anniversary, and it's on October the third Friday morning at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[time=1223] And we just ask that you come with a smile, bring a friend, and expect a good time, a blessing and a good time.
[time=1230] I'm sure that Jay Kesser has something very interesting to tell us, because he has experiences on life, and also Joyce Lemon, she'll be singing for us, and we'll just have a great time.
[time=1242] We'll have some dignitaries from the local city here, and we're going to have a great celebration here.
[time=1248] You come and join us.
[time=1249] If you can't come on that day, come on a Monday Friday, because we're here every Friday, 10 o'clock in the morning, and we welcome each and every one.
[time=1258] Thank you, George, and let me add to George's words my encouragement to join us this Friday for the anniversary of Super Sixties.
[time=1266] If you're 55 to 105, you're more than welcome to come and to bring a friend.
[time=1272] The program starts this Friday as it does each Friday.
[time=1275] At 10 o'clock, there'll be our special guest, Jay Kesser, who'll be speaking, and we'll have a great time of fellowship together, and then as always at Super Sixties, a tremendous lunch.
[time=1286] We hope that you can come.
[time=1288] We'd love to see you here this Friday.
[time=1290] Today, I would also like to encourage you to write for an excellent little publication called Timeless Insights.
[time=1297] Timeless Insights is a daily Bible study tool to help you and me read through the New Testament in one year.
[time=1304] Studying God's Word is the joy of our life, says Psalm 1.
[time=1308] I hope you were memorizing it with us this week.
[time=1311] Do you remember last week I asked you to memorize Psalm 1?
[time=1315] It says this, "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night."
[time=1331] How are you doing with that principle?
[time=1333] Are you meditating on God's Word?
[time=1335] Could you use a little help?
[time=1337] I could.
[time=1338] Timeless Insights provides that help.
[time=1341] If you would write to us today, we would send you your copy so that you could begin in the month of October with the Book of Matthew and then through the next 12 months, read through the entire New Testament, gaining some timeless insights.
[time=1355] If you would like a copy, simply write to us today at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1367] George, thank you for taking the time away from your class this morning to encourage our viewers to come to Super Sixties.
[time=1375] Thank you for inviting me, Rick.
[time=1377] And thank you for joining us.
[time=1378] I hope that you have both your heart and your Bible open now, so that we can continue in our worship service and study God's Word today.
[time=1397] [MUSIC - 220 seconds]
[time=1631] Thank you, Scott.
[time=1633] Let us pray together.
[time=1637] My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine.
[time=1646] For thee all the follies of sin I resign.
[time=1653] My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou.
[time=1660] If ever I love thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
[time=1668] My Jesus, it is now.
[time=1673] Lord Jesus, we bow before you this morning to humbly share in your love
[time=1682] as a body of believers to exchange a word of greeting, to build a relationship with one another.
[time=1692] But most of all, Lord Jesus, to declare and to affirm freshly today that we love you.
[time=1701] And we are humbled today because we know that we would not love you, or to accept you first loved us.
[time=1711] And we recognize today that it is you who has reached us and not we who have reached you.
[time=1719] And we thank you today, God, for your loving care that forgives us and gives new life.
[time=1727] And as we meet this morning, we call it an hour of worship.
[time=1730] Truly in this moment, God, we want to worship you as the triune being, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
[time=1739] The Father who had the plan.
[time=1741] The Son who died for our sins and the Spirit who makes us alive again.
[time=1746] God, we worship you today.
[time=1749] And as we desperately look for that which gives purpose and meaning to our life today, we've come to you, God, for you have made us and you have made us for yourself.
[time=1759] We want to find rest in our search.
[time=1762] So, God, today, we would ask that you would speak clearly to each one of us,
[time=1768] to the one who has never received Christ, that today they might sense that he alone gives life,
[time=1775] to those who know Christ, that they might be strengthened and fortified in faith.
[time=1781] We pray particularly for those who walk through some dark valleys, those who've lost loved ones, particularly in recent days like Mrs. Mauen and Marilyn Pierce.
[time=1795] God, that you would comfort them in their loss.
[time=1798] We'd pray for those who are battling for their health and their life.
[time=1803] Some with good days and others with dark days.
[time=1808] We would pray today for Joyce and for Harry and Catherine as they battled cancer.
[time=1814] We pray today for families.
[time=1817] For teenagers who are struggling to find a niche in life where they feel accepted,
[time=1823] God make them feel their acceptance by you and a purpose in life in serving you.
[time=1829] We pray for those who've gone through the fracture of a family, that you would give them the ability to hang on when others are letting go.
[time=1839] God, you know us and you know that we are quitters by our nature.
[time=1844] We ask you through your word to strengthen us, to teach us today that it's too soon to quit.
[time=1851] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1858] It had been one defeat after another.
[time=1862] Too many last place finishes.
[time=1865] A dejected athlete opened the door of his locker very slowly.
[time=1870] Tossed the shoes as they hit the bottom, the mud splashed back out on his feet.
[time=1877] Shook his head in frustration and then slammed the door with the words "I quit" and he walked away.
[time=1888] In his office, the father of that young athlete sat with a telephone receiver in his hand.
[time=1897] Again, it was a complaining customer.
[time=1900] A customer who he had watched out for and represented well and with integrity, and again he's called to belittle and to complain.
[time=1910] And when finally he hears the click of the other phone he takes his receiver and jams it down on its cradle and says the same words "I quit."
[time=1922] A few miles away in the suburb, the boy's mother, the businessman's wife,
[time=1928] walks through a home that she has labored to order with care, it's been destroyed.
[time=1935] Dinner sets cold on the table because practice went too late and worked at the office,
[time=1941] demanded some more over time.
[time=1943] And again the labor of a day when unnoticed, unappreciated, unreceived.
[time=1950] She takes the meat, opens the oven door, slides it back in and then purposely releases it
[time=1956] so the springs make it clash shut and says the same words "I quit."
[time=1967] The Bible says that love always protects.
[time=1973] Love always trusts.
[time=1978] Love always hopes.
[time=1983] Love always perseveres.
[time=1988] Open your Bibles please to 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=1992] We've been studying this for some time.
[time=1995] Some of you are nodding your heads and saying too long.
[time=1997] I hope we haven't drugged this out beyond your tolerance but just remember love perseveres.
[time=2003] Verses 4 through 8 this morning.
[time=2007] Love is patient.
[time=2009] Love is kind.
[time=2011] It does not envy.
[time=2012] It does not boast.
[time=2014] It is not proud.
[time=2018] It is not self-seeking.
[time=2020] It is not easily angered.
[time=2023] It keeps no record of wrongs.
[time=2027] Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[time=2037] It always protects.
[time=2039] It always trusts.
[time=2041] It always hopes.
[time=2043] It always perseveres.
[time=2046] Love never fails.
[time=2050] When life is falling apart, it is love that is the glue that keeps us together.
[time=2057] Each of us face a variety of frustrations, temptations, adversities, and disappointments
[time=2064] to which our normal human instincts want to say, "I quit."
[time=2071] I don't know how many times businessmen have taken their keys off of the ring to stick them in an envelope to throw it on the boss's desk to never return again.
[time=2081] I don't know how many times a mother has started to walk out of the garage of a home saying I quit to remember she had one more load of laundry to do and walk back in.
[time=2093] I don't know how many times the adolescent said, "I can't take this family anymore.
[time=2100] I quit." It ran away.
[time=2103] Didn't make it home until supper time.
[time=2106] Love is a glue.
[time=2107] It's an adhesive.
[time=2108] It's a healing agency that keeps us going when the machinery breaks down.
[time=2115] It holds us together.
[time=2117] Four little statements build, and this chapter is a crescendo of all the things that love
[time=2123] is and all the things that love does not do.
[time=2126] Everything has been a do or a don't.
[time=2129] This or that, but now we come to a different type of grammatical structure.
[time=2134] Just four rapid short statements that says, "Love does this."
[time=2140] It covers or protects.
[time=2143] It trusts or believes.
[time=2145] It hopes and it endures.
[time=2148] Let's look at those one at a time.
[time=2151] First of all, in the King James, it says, "Love, beareth all things are in the new or in the new international version," as we were reading today.
[time=2158] It says, "That love always protects." That word "protex" or "bears" can also mean "the cover." All of those things are brought into mind there.
[time=2171] I like the word "cover." I like the pit on the garage with wood, and we're making some things right now.
[time=2177] After you cut that board just right, and then you router it, and then you sand it,
[time=2183] and then you finish sand it, and then you stain it.
[time=2186] There's one thing you better do before you take it in the house, and you set that cool ice-cold coke, a cola bottle right down on it.
[time=2196] You better protect it.
[time=2198] You better take some polyurethane or some varnish or some satin, something that will cover that wood and that finish, and that layer then becomes a covering, something that protects, something that bears up the coca cola from the wood to protect it.
[time=2215] That's the concept of this word here.
[time=2218] It says that there is a dimension about love, that when we love one another, when we love our fellow man, when we love God, when we love our family, when we love our church, when we love our fellow workers, that there is a quality of love that has a layer about it that protects, that covers, that shields.
[time=2241] One of the great qualities about love is that it is a unique membrane that is both tough and tender.
[time=2248] That it's tender in that it lets our love flow out through us, but it's tough on the outside so that the little things that others say are, "Dude, don't hurt us," a unique quality.
[time=2261] It's a lot like the touch of our fingers.
[time=2264] Have you ever noticed the unique way God has made fingers?
[time=2268] Why fingers are pretty tough.
[time=2270] You know, if you take your fingers and you touch something hot, that will feel to your fingers very hot, but those fingers won't burn nearly as easy as your lips when you bring that hot cup of coffee to your mouth.
[time=2284] They're tough, and yet they're tender.
[time=2287] Did you ever try to pick up a dime with your elbow?
[time=2290] It just doesn't work too well, but those fingers, they're so capable of feeling that the tenderest, slightest difficulty, they can pick up something little.
[time=2299] That's a quality of love.
[time=2301] It says that I can take what's hitting me on the outside and yet not become callous that I'm not feeling about you.
[time=2309] A unique dimension.
[time=2311] Love has that ability to cover or to protect.
[time=2317] You know, as parents, we have certain instincts that we are protective of our children, particularly when somebody else accuses them, and we think accuses them unjustly.
[time=2328] We're so quick to say, "Well, that's not really what happened.
[time=2331] My son just didn't understand what you were saying, and if he had understood, he wouldn't have done that." Now, when your son does it, I say, "What do you expect?
[time=2341] He's just like his old man.
[time=2343] You can't ask for more out of him." Love for our children makes us kind of watch out for them, kind of protect them,
[time=2351] to think the best about them, and it's admirable.
[time=2355] Turn if you will to James chapter 5, and this same concept comes up again.
[time=2361] In James chapter 5 verses 19 through 20, it reads, "My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back, remember this, whoever turns a sinner from the air of his way
[time=2378] shall save him from death and cover a multitude of sins." There is something God honoring about taking sin and covering it up as quickly as we possibly can.
[time=2393] Now, in our society, that is not what is traditionally done, that sin is covered up.
[time=2400] Usually, if there's some offense, if there's some scandal, the first thing that's done is a phone call is made to the national inquirer.
[time=2408] So that next Monday morning, it can be blasted across every grocery store in America, and we can get the latest scandal on who's who.
[time=2418] True love does just the opposite.
[time=2420] It seeks not to bear B-A-R-E, but to bear
[time=2427] B-E-A-R.
[time=2430] Did I spell those right? I think I did.
[time=2433] My third grade teacher, both of them would be proud.
[time=2436] Do you see the difference, though?
[time=2438] One says that I'll bear it, I'll expose it, I'll reveal it.
[time=2441] The other one says I'll carry that burden.
[time=2444] That's the difference between love, as the Bible knows it, and the love that uses people as our society knows it.
[time=2453] It covers it, it bears it.
[time=2456] Just quickly, Proverbs, chapter 10, verse 12 said, hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs.
[time=2467] It covers it over.
[time=2469] It's not talking about a Watergate where we whitewash dishonesty, but it's simply saying that when I'm hurt, when I'm disappointed, when I feel like I've been violated, that I'm willing to instead of magnify that,
[time=2485] to cover it over.
[time=2487] Someone wrote these words.
[time=2489] Love is not blind, it sees more, not less, but because it sees more,
[time=2497] it's willing to see less.
[time=2502] You see, we have very limited perspective.
[time=2506] Once our mind flips from good to bad, we're somewhat binary.
[time=2510] We either think a person's good or bad, and once somebody does something and that hurts us, we begin to look at that person through the filter of their failure,
[time=2520] and we always see him that way.
[time=2523] But love takes that failure, and it covers it up so that when we look at them, we don't see that anymore.
[time=2531] Because love sees more, it chooses to see less and to overlook some shortcomings,
[time=2537] some faults.
[time=2539] First Peter, chapter 2 says this.
[time=2545] I'll jump in in verse 20.
[time=2548] But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it, but if you suffer for doing good and endure it, this is commendable before God.
[time=2558] To this you were called because Christ suffered for you leaving you an example
[time=2564] that you should follow in his steps. He committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth.
[time=2572] When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate.
[time=2576] When he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he trusted himself to him who judges justly.
[time=2583] He himself bore, bore our sins in his body on the tree so that we might die to sins
[time=2592] and live to righteousness. Do you see that pattern?
[time=2595] The pattern there is this that when you're hurt, not simply getting just punishment, but when somebody breaks your trust, when somebody misuses your name, when somebody attacks your character, breaks the agreement that you are willing to suffer,
[time=2612] not retaliating, not striking back, but instead you're like the Lord Jesus who was truly loving,
[time=2618] and he bore our sins. He is a sin bearer. That means that he came down on the cross
[time=2626] and he died for our sins, collecting them as if it were in his arm, and he carried them to Mount Calvary with him, and he bore those.
[time=2636] He carried those so that when his blood was shed, it could be a covering for our sins.
[time=2643] And now he says, that's our example, that we look at others who've wronged us through that same perspective of love,
[time=2652] and we cover, we block it out, and we bear their sins.
[time=2659] Then secondly, it says, love not only always protects or always bears, but secondly, love always trusts.
[time=2670] Some of the translations will say, love always believes.
[time=2673] Now you're saying, you mean we're supposed to believe anything and everything?
[time=2676] I mean, one of somebody tells you something and you know it's alive, or you're supposed to sit there and say, well, I love you, so I believe you.
[time=2684] You say, that's not faith, that's stupidity. You know what? You're right.
[time=2690] This little word always, I don't want to diminish its power or take away from it,
[time=2696] but this word always is being used in grammar as a hyperbole, which means an obvious exaggeration for the point of emphasis.
[time=2706] I've told you before that all means all, all the time, except for when all doesn't mean all.
[time=2711] The Bible uses all, or always, often to give us emphasize and to maximize the point.
[time=2718] For example, it said all of Jerusalem came out to see Jesus.
[time=2722] Well, they all didn't come, but it seemed like everybody came, and the crowd was enormous that the writer took a literary liberty of saying they all came.
[time=2732] Well, this word always doesn't mean that we believe the lie.
[time=2737] Just in the previous verses, it says, love does not rejoice in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
[time=2744] 1 John 4 verse 1 says, beloved, believe not every spirit, but test the spirits
[time=2750] to see whether they are of God or not.
[time=2753] Chapter 13 falls in the larger context of chapters 12, 13, and 14 on spiritual gifts,
[time=2759] and it begins like this in verse 12.
[time=2761] I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning spiritual gifts.
[time=2766] You know that when you were pagan, somehow or other, you were influenced and led astray to dumb idols. Therefore, I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says Jesus be cursed, and no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Spirit.
[time=2782] You know what he's saying there? He's saying discerned.
[time=2785] Test that one. What are they saying? Is it true?
[time=2789] Well, then what does it mean? If always doesn't mean you believe everything, what does it mean?
[time=2795] I think it means this, that it's our first instinct to trust somebody.
[time=2801] It's our first instinct to believe them. That we don't approach people with a skepticism and a cynicism, but there is a genuine trust of that individual.
[time=2813] Someone says, well, what if I did that?
[time=2818] What if I trusted somebody without reservation and they broke my trust?
[time=2825] What do I do? I believe the Bible gives this formula.
[time=2830] First, we forgive. That means we refuse to hold it against them.
[time=2836] It's as though a debt has been canceled and Mark paid off.
[time=2841] Just as God canceled the debt of our sin, and he said, I forgive it.
[time=2845] Secondly, after we forgive, we forget.
[time=2849] We may not be able to erase it from our memory, but we can erase it from our conduct.
[time=2854] We refuse to treat them as though they did that offense, even though they did it.
[time=2858] We forget that it happened and we restore them to a normal relationship.
[time=2862] And then thirdly, we trust.
[time=2865] Now, I really believe that trust is more earned than it is given.
[time=2871] So if you have been the guilty party and you've broken trust, don't look at your dad in the face and say, "Dad, they said this morning you're supposed to always trust."
[time=2881] Don't worry about the car. The body shop will take care of it.
[time=2884] Just trust me, the keys please.
[time=2888] You've got to earn trust.
[time=2892] If you are the type of person who is always late, and finally your contemporaries say,
[time=2899] "We can't trust you," don't say, "Oh, that's not very biblical." You've got to earn their trust.
[time=2906] You know, there's one person that I have daily interaction with who is consistently late.
[time=2912] Always this guy is late.
[time=2915] Now, I've learned to work with that guy.
[time=2918] And what I do is if I need him to be somewhere at 1 o'clock, I tell him 1245.
[time=2925] And that guy's name is Rick Hawks.
[time=2930] And I've got the lie to myself because I will be late.
[time=2934] Always take five more minutes to do this.
[time=2936] I'll sneak one more little errand in before I get there.
[time=2939] And so when I take out my little day timer, I write down, if I'm supposed to be somewhere at 1 o'clock, I write down 1245.
[time=2947] Now, you know what the problem is?
[time=2949] Then two weeks later I say, "Now, did I write down the right timer?
[time=2952] Or did I write down the Hawks time?
[time=2954] Do I need to be there then, or 15 minutes later, or should I leave 15 minutes earlier?" Isn't it frustrating when you can't trust somebody?
[time=2963] That's really a tough person to live with.
[time=2966] And you know what we have to do?
[time=2969] We have to earn trust.
[time=2972] You can't stand up to somebody and say, "I know that I've broken trust the last 20 times you gave it to me, but you're obligated to give it to me again.
[time=2980] You're obligated to earn it." And the person whose trust you have broken, I believe their responsibility is this.
[time=2988] Not so much to trust you when you're not trustworthy, but they are responsible to give you an opportunity to earn trust.
[time=2997] That's the father who says, "Son, I can't trust you with that car, but I'll give you another chance to earn trust." And so here are the new crown rules, and when you live by those, I'll trust you again.
[time=3010] It's the husband who says to his wife, "You violated trust in our marriage, and I can't just say I trust you, but I know that if we work at it,
[time=3020] we can re-earn that trust, and I'll give you that opportunity to earn that trust, will you give me that opportunity?" That's what it means to always trust.
[time=3030] It means to extend that opportunity again.
[time=3034] You say, "Well, what if I extended that opportunity, and they broke trust, and I extended, and they broke trust, and I extended, and they broke trust, and I can't keep track of how many times they've broken that trust.
[time=3048] What do you do?" Next phrase, "Love always protects, love always trusts, love always hopes."
[time=3058] Hope is the recognition that failure does not have to be final.
[time=3067] Hope is the ability that says, "I know they've broken trust again, and again, and again, but I hope, and I pray, that there's a change in their heart, and it's too soon for me to quit.
[time=3080] And to give up on that individual, I will hope for them." It has been said and said, "Well, each day of our life we're writing a book, a chapter a day.
[time=3090] Love looks at that individual who the last ten chapters are failure, failure, failure, and they hope and they pray that before the last chapter is written,
[time=3101] there's victory, that there's victory." Little boy had failed tests rather consistently.
[time=3110] He was distracting in class and holding the group back.
[time=3114] Finally, the teacher sent an old home with Tommy and said to his mother, "Please keep Tommy at home. He can't learn like the other children.
[time=3124] He has failed everything." And so, Mrs. Edison kept young Thomas Elva at home because he couldn't learn like the rest of the kids.
[time=3137] That's when a teacher said, "There's no hope." "Where there is faith, and where there is God, there is hope."
[time=3149] Admiral Judson was a missionary to the country of Burma.
[time=3153] To our knowledge, no one had been there as a missionary in centuries before Judson arrived.
[time=3160] For six years, Judson labored amongst the Burmanese people and for six years, no one professed Christ.
[time=3168] No one was baptized.
[time=3170] There were those that reviewed the situation with Judson and said, "Isn't it time to come home? Isn't it time to quit?
[time=3179] What hope do you have?" And Judson said, "As long as there is a God who is fulfilling his promises,
[time=3188] there is hope." And 100 churches were planted and 1,000 people responded to Judson's ministry
[time=3197] because he had hope.
[time=3200] He saw that it was too soon to quit.
[time=3204] By our nature were quitters.
[time=3207] By our attitude, we give up in the face of adversity.
[time=3212] But God says it's too soon to quit.
[time=3215] Some of you have fought long battles with your health.
[time=3219] Others of you are battling with your emotions daily.
[time=3223] Some of you are battling to be faithful to a spouse that's broken your trust.
[time=3228] Some of you are fighting with the rebelliousness of a student.
[time=3232] Others of you are laboring in a business that's yet to sow a prophet.
[time=3236] But it's too soon to quit.
[time=3242] Never quit on a person.
[time=3245] We may have to protect.
[time=3247] We may have to cover.
[time=3249] We don't have to give up hope.
[time=3252] We can endure.
[time=3254] And that's the last statement.
[time=3256] It says, "Love always endures." Or, "Love always perseveres." That word means to hold up under pressure.
[time=3265] When the pressure coming down is so great, there's a tendency to want to squirm out on the sides.
[time=3273] Do you ever shoot watermelon seeds?
[time=3275] You take your thumb and you come down on a watermelon seed and you apply enough down pressure, and then if you just tip your thumb in the right direction, it'll squirt out in that direction.
[time=3285] That down pressure is our word for persevering.
[time=3290] It means to stand up under pressure and to not squirt out.
[time=3295] Actually, it's used as often as any other way as a military term.
[time=3299] A military term that means to stand up in the face of adversity.
[time=3306] During the early days of the Civil War, the Southern Army called the Army of Northern Virginia under generally consistently routed the Northern Army of the Army of the Potomac.
[time=3317] But in one battle, the Army of the Potomac, the Yankee forces begin to drive the Southern Army back.
[time=3322] And they were retreating, and Lee and his forces were retreating, and the other flank was retreating.
[time=3327] But one flank stood their ground.
[time=3330] One man, a general, marched to the front, and he stood his ground.
[time=3335] And Lee could see across the battlefield Thomas Jackson standing his ground, and he yelled to his men, "Look, there stands Jackson like a stone wall!" And you know that Southern Army stood, and they fought, and they drove the Union Army back to the streets of Washington, D.C., because someone said, "I'll stand like a stone wall." That's what this word means, standing in the face of battle.
[time=3364] The Persian Army had landed on the Peloponnesis of Greece.
[time=3368] They had conquered their known world except for that peninsula country.
[time=3374] They were beginning to move south.
[time=3377] They had to move through a narrow strait, and after that, the plane was open all the way to Athens.
[time=3382] The Athenian Army was not ready to battle, but 300 Spartans went to that strait.
[time=3387] And 300 Spartans stood in a gap.
[time=3390] And in that narrow SMS, 300 Spartans held off the thousands of the Army of Persia,
[time=3399] held them off long enough until one man could run 26 miles from the Straits of Marathon to the city of Athens to declare that 300 Spartans stood, and they held them off until the Athenians could be mustered and victory could be given.
[time=3418] That's what that word means.
[time=3420] It means to stand up in the face of adversity.
[time=3424] One hymn writer has written these words.
[time=3427] "Am I a soldier of the cross, a follower of the Lamb?
[time=3432] And shall I fear to own his cause or blush to speak his name?
[time=3438] Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others fought to win the prize and sailed the bloody seas?
[time=3447] Are there no foes for me to face?
[time=3450] Must I not stem the flood?
[time=3453] Is this vile world a friend of grace to help me unto God?
[time=3459] Surely I must fight if I would reign, increase my courage, Lord,
[time=3465] all bear the toil, endure the pain, supported by thy word.
[time=3473] Today there are those who must fight the fight, as Paul did with Nero.
[time=3478] Behind the bamboo or iron curtain, you and I have been spared that fight.
[time=3483] But there is the battle for integrity.
[time=3486] There is the fight to love an unfaithful mate.
[time=3490] The fight to love a rebellious teenager.
[time=3493] A fight to love a brother or sister that's broken trust.
[time=3497] And it's too soon to quit.
