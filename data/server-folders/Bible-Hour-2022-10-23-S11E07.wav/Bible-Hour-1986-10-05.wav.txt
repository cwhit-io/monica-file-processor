[time=981] Again I want to thank you for joining us today and I trust that as Craig preaches your heart
[time=987] will be open both to his message and to the Word of God.
[time=991] It's a privilege to have him as a friend and to have him here to minister to us.
[time=995] Thank you for joining us today and may God bless you.
[time=1013] All the laughter is gone and the sounds of the songs that I say slowly fade it away.
[time=1030] Simple joys that I knew when I walked close with you and in hand in the cool of the day.
[time=1043] I just, memories, or are they true?
[time=1063] How I hold to the hope that the music will come back again.
[time=1079] Bring back the glory won't you show me what life is for.
[time=1092] Bring back the glory, make me open once more.
[time=1104] Bring back the music and the trust, the wonder that's just like a child who has never known
[time=1119] you, bring back the glory, the glory again.
[time=1133] Give me a cause that is grand and a vision to stand that calls for the best I can be.
[time=1154] Everything worthy to live for and a reason to give, everything I ever could be, oh there
[time=1165] must be more.
[time=1167] Take me home.
[time=1168] How I need you to give me a glimpse of eternity.
[time=1173] You are the glory, you have shown me what life is for, you are the glory.
[time=1196] Make me like you once more, you are the music and the trust, the wonder that's just like
[time=1221] a child who has never known pain, you are the glory, you are the glory, you are the glory
[time=1238] of the glory, you are the glory, you are the glory, you are the glory, you are the glory
[time=1265] of the glory.
[time=1274] Our dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this morning and we realize that people have
[time=1281] come from various circumstances this morning.
[time=1285] Some having heard from loss of loved ones, some rejoicing because of physical restoration
[time=1292] in their body after operations and we thank you for the healing power and we thank you for doctors who have the wisdom to help our people and their body illnesses that you can
[time=1304] indeed show them how to restore.
[time=1308] We pray for people here who are spiritually hurting and need to pray out to you Lord, restore the joy of my salvation, bring back the glory of knowing you as personal Savior.
[time=1321] We pray that our hearts and spirits might be open to the message from God's Word.
[time=1326] You allow us to listen carefully and we pray for Pastor Craig as he speaks to us that you
[time=1332] will just anoint him and give him the freedom, bring forth God's Word this morning.
[time=1338] In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[time=1343] We've had a lot of illness and death in our family at Blackhawk just in the last couple
[time=1349] days and we want to pray for families as George has already prayed today.
[time=1354] We also praise the Lord for the restoration and Lois Clancy's body and how he's healing her after her very serious operation and David McIntosh's home from the hospital.
[time=1364] We've had a lot of joy in our household in the last week or so and celebration of Lisa's
[time=1370] wedding.
[time=1371] This morning during the first service I got a call from Carol and her dad passed away this morning.
[time=1376] So I hope that you'll pray for us and the Lord will intercede and we know that he knew
[time=1382] Christ as his personal Savior and we're rejoicing in that and trusting in the peace that we've talked about many times that God can give for us right now.
[time=1390] Craig Clapher has been at Blackhawk more many times.
[time=1394] A few years ago he came from Grace Seminary to teach a Sunday school class here at Blackhawk and I heard many good things about him through our Pastor Rick.
[time=1403] We're good friends and you remember that Rick was at his church not too long ago as Craig became the new pastor of Trinity Evangelical Free Church in South Bend, Indiana.
[time=1414] Today Craig is with us and he's going to speak in the absence of our pastor.
[time=1417] We're glad that he's here and we welcome him to the pulpit.
[time=1420] The Lord bless you Craig.
[time=1425] Thank you Pete.
[time=1426] It is a great joy for me and my family to be here today and see many friends from the
[time=1432] past.
[time=1433] As Pete stated while at Grace Seminary we traveled over here on weekends and would spend the day here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1440] We would usually go to the mall and eat and the children would ice skate for the afternoon
[time=1446] and then we would come back for the evening service.
[time=1449] We really enjoy coming here because of you but also because of our dear friend Rick Hawks.
[time=1454] I knew Rick and Kathy as we were probably in our late teens early twenties working in
[time=1460] camps together and it's so good to be back in this area to be able to rub shoulders with
[time=1467] Rick Hawks.
[time=1469] Proverb states that iron sharpens iron and in that same way one man has the ability to sharpen another man.
[time=1475] I'm never with Rick that I don't leave believing that I'm a better person for having been with him.
[time=1481] It's so good to be here, so good to be even back believe it or not in the South Bend,
[time=1488] Indiana area after moving to Florida.
[time=1491] We moved to Boca Raton, Florida where I was an associate pastor but may I say I found a gold mine in South Bend.
[time=1498] Trinity Evangelical Free Church is a great church and it was well worth leaving the coastline
[time=1504] to come back up.
[time=1505] Some laugh and say you haven't been here for the winter yet.
[time=1508] Well, I hope I can say that on January 1st.
[time=1512] Let's pray and ask God's blessing upon this service.
[time=1515] Father, it is a joy to know you to speak on your behalf and now I pray that the words
[time=1522] of my mouth, the meditations of my heart would be acceptable and I cite that you would empower
[time=1528] me that your spirit would speak through me, guide and direct my thoughts and my spirit
[time=1534] and then I pray that same thing for each person here.
[time=1537] Father, we give you this time, we've met to worship, but we've also met to be touched
[time=1543] by you to know the experience of experiencing you.
[time=1548] I pray that that happens in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1553] There's a book out called Beyond Forgiveness by Don Baker.
[time=1559] Don Baker is currently the pastor of the Rockford, Illinois Evangelical Free Church in Rockford,
[time=1566] Illinois.
[time=1567] Previously, he had been out in Portland, Oregon at a church that was very historical.
[time=1572] Many great pastors had been there in the past and it was a great honor for Don Baker to take that church into pastor Hinson Memorial Church.
[time=1580] He spoke very openly about some situations that occurred in that church in his book Beyond
[time=1586] Forgiveness.
[time=1587] As I stated, it was a historical church, a church well known that it had many tremendous
[time=1593] pastors.
[time=1594] It attracted a tremendous staff.
[time=1597] They had a great growth occurring.
[time=1600] It was a tremendous church with a bright future, but into the midst of all of that wonderful
[time=1609] experience came a phone call.
[time=1612] The silence of my study was interrupted by the persistent ringing of the telephone.
[time=1618] A longtime friend from a distant city was calling, "I'm sorry Don, I bad news for you."
[time=1624] One of your people has been deeply involved in sin for many years.
[time=1629] The whole sordid story is just beginning to surface here and I thought I'd call you so that you could deal with it before it comes to you second hand.
[time=1637] I listened as he described a long series of events, 11 affairs in four churches over
[time=1644] 13 years with all the confirming evidence that was needed.
[time=1650] It was not just one of my people, it was one of my dear friends, it was one of my staff.
[time=1657] When he finished, I replaced the phone, sat in stunned disbelief for a few moments and
[time=1665] then I laid my head on my desk and I cried and I cried.
[time=1672] There was another man that had had a wonderful experience, his name was Ezra, Ezra the priest, the man well known for his study of the Word of God, his obedience to the Word of God and his teaching of the Word of God.
[time=1685] He was probably born and raised in exile because you see Israel was brought out of Egypt, brought
[time=1691] into a new land and told do not mingle with the other people in this land.
[time=1697] If you do before long you'll start worshiping their gods and following their ways which are detestable in my sight.
[time=1704] They hadn't obeyed and as chastisement but also to bring them back to God, God had brought
[time=1711] another nation Babylonian, taken Israel into captivity for 70 years and then after 70 years
[time=1719] as Jeremiah the prophet had declared they would be able to return to the land.
[time=1723] Zareb Babel led the first wave, almost 50,000 Jews returned back to Jerusalem and although
[time=1730] there was much hostility, much opposition they were able to rebuild the altar and the temple and go back and have their religious services.
[time=1741] Almost 60 years later Ezra the priest got a burden to go back to Israel also to Jerusalem
[time=1749] and with him he took almost 2,000 spiritual leaders, apparently there was a need for priest,
[time=1756] for Levites, for doorkeepers, ushers and for singers.
[time=1762] Because of his great leadership ability he was able to instill a vision within these people and they returned to Israel.
[time=1770] All things were going so good, now they had a great fantastic leader in Ezra and the staff,
[time=1778] they had all the staff in place and they had just conducted a marvelous worship service
[time=1784] in which they had presented a sacrifice of what today would be almost $5 million and
[time=1792] he gave great sacrifice of animals but into the midst of that the phone call came.
[time=1800] Would you turn with me to Ezra chapter 9, the book of Ezra chapter 9 and if you're
[time=1806] like me some of those Old Testament books are still difficult to find so I'll help you, goes first and second kings, first and second chronicles Ezra then Nehemiah, the book of
[time=1819] Ezra.
[time=1830] Ezra had been there for four and a half months, things were going oh so well and then came
[time=1838] the leaders report.
[time=1841] Ezra chapter 9 and verse 1, after these things had been done the leaders came to me and said
[time=1849] the people of Israel including the priest, the Levites have not kept themselves separate
[time=1855] from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices like those of the Canaanites, the
[time=1862] parasites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites, they have taken some
[time=1870] of their daughters as wise for themselves and their sons and have mingled the holy
[time=1876] race with the peoples around them and the leaders and officials have led the way in
[time=1883] this unfaithfulness, the phone call came, the leaders came and they said Ezra something's
[time=1889] wrong here, out of that first wave of Zarebabel the almost 50,000 some have not kept themselves
[time=1895] pure.
[time=1896] As we see later there were about 17 priests, 10 Levites, those were the priest assistants
[time=1903] and 84 others that had come back and Ezra they went back and they sang the same old
[time=1909] song in a sense, Ezra they went out and they mingled with the other peoples and took on
[time=1915] their detestable practices, what would be some of these detestable practices that would
[time=1921] cause God not over racial reasons but rather over religious reasons to say I don't want
[time=1928] you to mingle with these people, well first of all they didn't worship the God of creation but rather they worship the creation and in doing so to get the crops fertilized they may have a fertility right, an orgy to worship and bring down the favor of the fertility
[time=1944] God or goddess.
[time=1946] They began to not only have a bad relationship with Yahweh but in their worship service they
[time=1952] would use each other for pleasure, they had detestable practices and then to sacrifice
[time=1960] to their gods they gave what they considered the ultimate sacrifice, they would take their children and throw them into the fire, something which God said in the book of Jeremiah I never
[time=1971] even thought of such a thing, that's not the way I am, I don't want those type of sacrifices,
[time=1978] they didn't understand God, these heathen people, therefore when God brought Israel into the land He said drive them out, do not mix with them, I want you to be a holy race, that's
[time=1989] why I began this in the first place, I took one man Abraham and I taught him about myself and I said Abraham keep yourself pure, oh Abraham I want to do great things for you, I want to produce a nation that knows me, I know them and I can prove to the world what kind of a God I am, keep yourself pure so that can be accomplished, Abraham be God Isaac, Isaac be God Jake and we see that there was always some problems with this intermarrying,
[time=2014] this mingling with the other races, not being pure.
[time=2017] He said but I want a holy race, my seed my son will come through this holy race, purity
[time=2024] was extremely important to God and yet look over at verse 11, chapter 9 verse 11 says
[time=2033] you gave through your servants the prophets when you said the land that you are entering
[time=2039] to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its people, by their detestable practices
[time=2046] they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other, therefore do not give
[time=2052] your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, do not further their welfare or prosperity at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good
[time=2062] things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.
[time=2068] God said I have eternity in view, looking on down the road, stay pure, don't mix with
[time=2074] the people, drive them out instead because I have great things planned, don't lead your
[time=2080] own children astray, as I stand in this pulpit and I think of Rick Hawks and I have shared with you that I am so much better for having known him in my life and to know Kathy over the years, Rick shared with me, he said Craig remember all those we used to work with in camp years ago, I said yes and even at our age we look out at those that have fallen,
[time=2101] did you know that so-and-so doesn't walk with God anymore, do you know that so-and-so did not keep themselves pure and has a horrible blot upon their name and have gone off away
[time=2112] from God today and we're young, we're young, someone said few Christians end well, it's
[time=2119] so easy to get off the track to not remain pure for God.
[time=2124] Well that was the leaders report, what would be the response of a great spiritual leader
[time=2131] such as Ezra to this type of report, Don Baker said I laid my head on my desk and I cried,
[time=2139] the dream is over, all these wonderful things it doesn't matter, let's look at Ezra's response
[time=2146] chapter 9 and verse 5, when I heard this I tore my tunic and my cloak, I pulled hair
[time=2155] from my head and my beard, I sat down appalled, appalled me to become overwhelmed almost like
[time=2162] in horror with emotion, then everyone who trembled at the words of God of Israel gathered
[time=2168] around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles, I sat there appalled into the evening sacrifice, it's time for church now, it's time to go do the evening sacrifice,
[time=2179] Ezra's the leading priest but he's appalled, he's a mess, he's overwhelmed with emotion,
[time=2187] it's time for the evening sacrifice, what does he do, he said then at the evening sacrifice I rose for myself a basement and with my tunic and my cloak torn, I fell on my knees with
[time=2198] my hands spread out to the Lord my God and prayed, oh my God I am too ashamed and I'm
[time=2204] too disgraced to lift up my face to you my God because of our sins which are higher
[time=2210] than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens, from this day on our forefathers
[time=2216] until now our guilt has been great, because of our sins we and our kings and our priests
[time=2223] have been subjected to the sword in captivity, to pillage, to humiliation at the hands of
[time=2229] the foreign kings as it is today, let's stop there.
[time=2234] No evening sacrifice, he said God when I worship you, when I lead people worship I'm to lift
[time=2240] up my face and my hands to you but representative of the nation my hands are dirty and he could
[time=2247] remember what Isaiah the prophet said, they too were in that condition and would traipse right on in to their evening worship service, Isaiah the prophet declaring what God would
[time=2258] say said this, God said why are you trespassing on my courts, why are you coming to this worship
[time=2265] service, when you lift up your hands to me in your face I'll cover my eyes I don't want
[time=2272] to see you, when you pray I'll plug my ears I don't want to hear it, when you burn your incense I'll plug my nose I don't want to smell it because your hands are dirty, your
[time=2285] hearts are dirty, instead cleanse yourselves come let us reason together say it the Lord
[time=2291] though your sins are scarlet I'll make you white as snow, red light crimson you'll be clean, God expects purity rather than just going on with worship, we see a man who is
[time=2305] devastated by impurity, let's go on verse 8 he said but now for a brief moment the Lord
[time=2315] our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant, giving us a firm place in his sanctuary and
[time=2322] so our God gives light to our eyes a little relief in our bondage though we are slaves our God has not deserted us in our bondage, he's shown us kindness in the side of the kings of Persia, he's granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair
[time=2338] its ruins, he's given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem but now oh my God what
[time=2344] can we say after this we've disregarded your commands that you gave through your servant
[time=2351] he says God for a little while we thought that the old cycle was over with of having
[time=2358] a period of peace and then going right back into sin but God it looks like the old cycles
[time=2364] back what's next God captivity again we can't go on with worship God we're impure, last
[time=2370] time you took us in the Babylon the ten tribes have been wiped out in the Assyrian captivity
[time=2376] here we are God we're so small fifty some thousand and now only a remnant are keeping themselves pure God are going to wipe us out you could, you would be justified in wiping us out God we have no reason to stand in your presence God because we are guilty we have
[time=2393] great guilt he said he said we thought we had a firm place your translation may read
[time=2399] God we had a nail to hang on there for a little while God we had a peg God we thought we were
[time=2406] back in the land and things were going to be different and things were going to happen we were going to grow we were going to be a shining light God we were going to be that pure race that you could bring your son through but God the dream is over here we are sitting
[time=2421] in pollution again God God the other nations you said drive them out you wouldn't treat us any differently God we stand before you this day and we cannot lift our faces up to
[time=2433] you Don Baker in his book states this the church has concerned itself with its theological
[time=2442] position and its church growth programs for so long that it has neglected its need for
[time=2449] personal and collective purity the scriptures make clear that theological
[time=2456] preciseness extensive church growth programs are wasted in the shadows of undisciplined
[time=2465] living preaching and programs can be instantly suffocated when submerged into the murky waters
[time=2473] of just one church scandal what's he saying he's saying like myself of all the mail that
[time=2480] I get from Christian organizations there are so many telling you how to grow and of all
[time=2487] the seminars that we go to it seems how do we grow how can we get bigger bigger bigger
[time=2493] and it seems that we're so concerned with theological preciseness how can I parse this
[time=2501] verb how do I know I am correct on this theological issue we are so caught up in that but I don't
[time=2509] see anybody too concerned putting on a seminar or sending out literature on how to be pure
[time=2520] it's time that the church concerns itself with personal and collective purity I shared
[time=2529] that I just took a church in South Bend Indiana one of the desires of my heart would be that we would grow oh I want to win people to Jesus Christ I want to reach South Bend Indiana for Jesus Christ our missions week is going on right now I want to win people in Indonesia
[time=2545] for Jesus Christ I want to be theologically precise but I hope that our church and myself
[time=2554] are even more concerned about being a good representation to be holy to be set apart
[time=2562] to be clean to be pure after all why are we really here I don't think we really got involved
[time=2568] in Christianity because we had a a real fetish with theology and I don't believe it was was
[time=2574] because we had this great desire to just attend an organization that got bigger and bigger
[time=2580] no someone declared that the church is a society of sinners who have gotten together to do
[time=2586] something about it the desire of my heart is to do something about it to be pure to be
[time=2593] clean do you know who Vance Havner is Vance Havner died just a few weeks ago he was 84
[time=2599] years old started preaching at age 12 in the boondocks of Tennessee Vance Havner said
[time=2606] he lived so far back in that he not only didn't know what was happening he didn't even suspect
[time=2615] Vance Havner was a clean pure man Billy Graham gave his eulogy and I can't think of a better
[time=2621] eulogy than this he said everyone is born an original but most people die carbon copies
[time=2630] Vance Havner died an original he was different he was pure he was clean he was holy I can
[time=2638] remember hearing him speak once and he stated this this was in Chicago at Moody Bible Institute
[time=2644] he stated this that he remember going into an underground restaurant in Chicago to eat
[time=2651] but he couldn't read the menu he didn't know what he was going to do but after a few moments he looked at the menu again and he commented to his friend that he could read the menu and then he looked at his friend and he said isn't it funny how we get used to the dark
[time=2670] isn't it funny how we get used to the darkness that all of a sudden those others it doesn't
[time=2676] seem so bad those detestable practices are not quite so bad to us after all we need to
[time=2682] be understanding and yet God has called us here to be different to be pure to be clean
[time=2688] to be his representation as was response he said I'm appalled I'm ashamed I'm disre I'm
[time=2696] I'm disgraced I am guilty what was the response of the people what would be the congregations
[time=2702] response to viewing a man their leader who was so devastated by impurity chapter 10 in
[time=2709] verse one would you read there with me while Ezra was praying and confessing weeping throwing
[time=2724] himself down before the house of God a large crowd of Israelites men women children gathered
[time=2732] around him they too wept bitterly then shekiniah son of jahyle one of the descendants of elam
[time=2740] said Ezra we've been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples
[time=2746] around us but in spite of this there is still hope for Israel now let us make a covenant
[time=2754] before our God to send away all these women and their children in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of all those who fear the commandments of God let it be done according to the law rise up this matter is in your hands we'll support you go take courage do
[time=2770] it Ezra what did he suggest Ezra not ashamed of being overwhelmed by his impurity the congregation
[time=2779] come they say Ezra it's time for the evening sacrifice let's go on with the worship service let's have stirring music Ezra Ezra I like your ushers Ezra I'm glad I like all your
[time=2790] priests in your Levites Ezra you got we got the greatest preacher we've got the greatest
[time=2796] most wonderful staff Ezra we got the greatest choir the ushers are so friendly they always
[time=2803] smile and always keep the right seat for me Ezra let's have a grand worship service
[time=2809] where's Ezra he's crying he's got his clothes ripped up his beards ripped out his hairs
[time=2815] plucked out all the signs morning and then the word comes out seventeen priest ten Levites
[time=2824] which included some singers some gatekeepers and eighty four others out of Israel have not kept themselves pure they've married the foreign women and by marrying the foreman foreign women they've had children and by having the children they polluted the race they've taken on the detestable practices it's influencing the whole congregation we are polluted and they all put their heads on their desk and they cried they were repentant
[time=2853] one man shekiniah said wait our whole history's been this way it seems there'd be a period
[time=2859] of peace shalom and then what would we do we would sin and then we would crowd the God
[time=2865] there'd be supplication and you know what God always did he always sent a savior and he always purified us and then we would go back to peace again he'll do it again Ezra Ezra the dreams not over four and a half months wasn't all there was Ezra we can still have a glorious time even here in Israel what's the remedy shekiniah get rid of all the women
[time=2887] and their children divorced them send them back to their heathen countries if they don't become a proselyte if they are determined to pollute our race and they will not turn
[time=2898] to our God and worship our God then we expect everyone to divorce their wives and their
[time=2904] children send them back come on Ezra we're behind you do it Ezra and said Ezra did
[time=2911] it you to read the rest of the chapter they had a meeting they stood in a downpour of rain and repentance was cold it was terrible and they said we'll do it it took a few months
[time=2922] they had hearings with each family 111 families and they cut themselves off and sent their
[time=2929] wives and children back unless those wives and children would convert over become a proselyte
[time=2935] of Judaism and worship the true God and not pollute the race you say well that's pretty drastic isn't it yes it is yes it is deal drastically with sin you say well I thought
[time=2947] the Bible said God hates divorce he does malachi where it says that he hates divorce that's
[time=2953] the place where he also says I hate what you're doing you're divorcing your own wives and children not paying any attention to them and taking in these other women you're not only polluting your relationship with me the world but your own people it's all rotten
[time=2969] it is so horrible we're going to have to do something drastic divorce them and send them back Jesus Christ himself said in Matthew chapter 5 there comes a time to deal drastically
[time=2981] with sin speaking in hyperbole that means exaggerating for effect Jesus said if you're right I
[time=2988] offends thee if it causes you to go into error you're right I the one that you aim with the
[time=2994] one that you trust if it offends thee pluck it out and throw it away if you're right hand you're strong one the one that you trust in for strength to protect yourself if it offends you if it leads you astray although you love your hand although you need it chop it off and throw it away it's better to go through life maimed than to go to hell the words of
[time=3014] Jesus Christ God son the loving one it's better to cut it out to deal drastically with sin
[time=3023] than to go through life polluted drastic measures a friend of mine Dr. Whit Ewing in Akron Ohio
[time=3033] was a part of a series I did as a youth minister in which we brought in different professions and we called it Christians on the job each week into the youth department would come a certain person with who was a he worked a certain job him or her and we had school
[time=3048] teachers firemen different vocations would come in and they would share why they went into that profession what they like about it what they dislike about it how they got there what type of schooling they needed to do why you might want to go into that profession
[time=3064] and then how being a Christian affects them in that profession we went through various
[time=3071] types of professions but one day we had Dr. Whit Ewing in a great orthopedic surgeon that did the scopes his wife shared with me that he used to go home when they were learning to do that and so the insides of great fruits and oranges together the tissue to practice
[time=3087] he came in but he wasn't himself something was wrong that morning he was overwhelmed by grief he started to share but he broke down but then through sharing he said this he said this morning as I made my rounds I went to the bed of a young nine year old
[time=3102] boy we'll call him Bob I don't know what his name was Bob had cancer he was going to have to amputate Bob's leg he sat down at his bed and he started to explain cancer and
[time=3114] then he finally told me said Bob you have cancer you have cancer in your leg and that's why it's not working he said Bob I love you so much I don't want that cancer to get up
[time=3124] in the rest of your body if we just let it go it'll come up in your stomach and all throughout your body and Bob before long it'll go all throughout your body this disease and then Bob you'll die a little boy so I want to die he said I want you to die either Bob Bob I love you so much I'm going to have to do something I don't want to do oh it's
[time=3145] so drastic Bob I hope you understand Bob do you have any idea what I'm going to have to do you're going to cut my leg off aren't you he says yeah I'm going to cut your leg
[time=3157] off I hope you understand little boy cried he cried too the next morning this was Sunday
[time=3163] he was going to chop his leg off me doctor right no because he loved him do you know that
[time=3172] the Lord Jesus Christ loves you too I'm not saying divorce your wives it's a call to
[time=3178] purity deal drastically with sin personally collectively Don Baker in an article speaking
[time=3186] about his book beyond forgiveness he was interviewed said this the most important statement that
[time=3192] I make in this book is church discipline is designed for restoration not retribution restoration
[time=3205] God has a way of amputating something out of our life and yet one day we'll look back to him and say thank you so much God God I thought I needed that you cut it out it hurt so awful I didn't understand God but God it was good is there an area of your life I'm speaking to myself my own church is there an area of your life it seems to always be there you know you ought to chop it off you know you ought to throw it away but it seems to be so needed it's the one that gives you strength it's the one that seems to give you a vision in life you need it drastically cut it out cut it out would you turn with me to second
[time=3241] Corinthians chapter six the Apostle Paul loved a group of people but they were pretty corrupt
[time=3265] they needed some things cut out they even needed some people one man in particular cut out of the assembly he said I'm cutting him out not to reject him but rather let's restore him let's restore him back chapter six verse fourteen says do not be yoked together with
[time=3284] unbelievers for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common what fellowship can
[time=3290] light have with darkness what harmony is there between Christ and Belial what is the believer
[time=3297] have in common with the non believer what agreement is there between the temple of God
[time=3303] and idols for we are the temple of the living God as God has said I'll live with them and
[time=3310] I'll walk amongst them I'll be their God and they shall be my people therefore come out
[time=3316] from them and be separate says the Lord touch not the unclean thing I'll receive you I'll
[time=3322] be to you like a father you will be my sons and daughters says the Lord God Almighty
[time=3328] since you have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates our body and our spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for God do you reverence
[time=3341] God do you really trust him do you really stand in awe of God then perfect holiness because
[time=3348] you reverence God he's a good God he loves us all he wants is pure have you known that experience Kathy saying about in a sense those seasons when we're out of God's when we're saying well the sunlight ever come back well I ever know that joy my salvation again I've known the experience of being out of fellowship with God because I didn't chop it off I didn't throw it away I didn't pluck it out my guess is if you've traveled very far with him you've
[time=3373] known that experience ah let's know the joy of the salvation let's know that as King David
[time=3380] said it was good for me that I was afflicted that guy cut it off because now I experience a deep meaningful relationship daily as I walk with Jesus Christ my Savior Ezra could
[time=3392] not go to the assembly to sacrifice ah but we've had a great sacrifice the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=3399] on our behalf therefore we may enter boldly to the throne of grace in time of need because
[time=3406] of his death the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf let's be clean and pure let's pray
[time=3418] our God and Father as I stand here as the pastor of another church I pray that we would
[time=3424] be a pure church that we would be more concerned about being a representative to you in purity
[time=3432] rather than in size or in preciseness because I believe that's the desire of your heart and
[time=3440] I pray that for Black Hawk Baptist Church also and for my friend Rick Hawks that Black
[time=3446] Hawk would be known as a church that is pure and clean and out of that purity there is growth that occurs new buildings new visions a bright future great services a wonderful
[time=3457] pastor wonderful people may they penetrate South Bend or rather Fort Wayne and may they
[time=3465] penetrate the world through their missions department for you bless this church I pray
[time=3471] that if there's anyone here this morning that feels overwhelmed by their guilt they're appalled
[time=3477] that they too would know that great sacrifice the Lord Jesus Christ on their behalf speak
[time=3483] to their hearts now in Jesus name Amen.
