[time=90] Love conquers all as such a popular phrase, yet it is not true, for you see the Lord Jesus was love perfected, yet he was despised and rejected.
[time=118] Love's more like a Time X Watch, it takes a licking, but it keeps on ticking.
[time=126] (music playing) Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks, thank you for joining us.
[time=141] Today, Rick's message is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 13, and is entitled, "Love Never Fails."
[time=149] Love never fails as the climax of the divine list of qualities of love.
[time=153] Today, we conclude our six-week study on the Love Chapter.
[time=157] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=162] We'll be looking at verses 8 through 13.
[time=167] Special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir.
[time=172] We'll also be hearing from celebration, and Kerry Johnson.
[time=183] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=192] We pray the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=197] Now here's Rick.
[time=200] For our morning worship service, and to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour,
[time=206] this is a monumental day in the history of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=210] And all the years that I've been here, I don't remember a time that anyone ever sat in the front row of our church,
[time=216] and we've got a deacon in his wife in this row and a group of young people in this row, and this is an exciting day.
[time=222] Nick, I don't think anyone's ever sat in front of you, have they?
[time=225] Nick's reserved that seat in the second row, but we are delighted that you're here today, and this overflowing crowd is an encouragement to the fact that God's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is alive.
[time=237] And He is alive within our hearts, and it's Him that we come to worship today.
[time=242] And I sincerely hope that you know Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=246] And if you do not, that today you would open up your heart and investigate the claims of the Scripture,
[time=252] the words of Jesus Himself, that He died on the cross for our sins, that we could have newness of life.
[time=259] It's a delight to have you with us today.
[time=261] Our choir begins our worship service with an old hymn of praise, calling us to attention to the Lord Jesus Christ, whom we worship today.

[time=1875] There it is to your table we come today and we would sit at your feet.
[time=1879] We would worship you, Lord Jesus, and declare that we love you.
[time=1883] And we love the life that you've given us, a forgiveness through a new birth.
[time=1889] And we come today to share our excitement as a body of people and to strengthen the one who is discouraged, to comfort the one who has suffered loss, and to rejoice with that one who has sensed victory.
[time=1902] Father, today, we pray that you would break forth your word as bread, and you would feed us as though it were food for our soul.
[time=1910] We would pray today that you would feed those who are in need of comfort.
[time=1915] We would pray today for Jackie Claire and Lenta Bander, Carol Coby and Midge Burton, as each of them have lost one of their parents.
[time=1924] They have lost part of their heritage. They would today need to know of your comfort.
[time=1929] Father, we today would pray for Ila and her family as Harry.
[time=1933] This past week would pass away after a long battle with cancer.
[time=1937] You as the God of all comfort would feed them with a word of comfort.
[time=1942] Father, we pray that you would feed parents with a word of encouragement many today wrestle with children or even grown children who have not walked in obedience to you and have made shipwrecked their life, that you might give parents that extra grace of perseverance.
[time=1960] Father, we would ask you to feed them with that word of encouragement.
[time=1965] Father, we would pray for our church that we would be a spiritual hospital, that we would receive those brothers and sisters in Christ who have been wounded, who have gone astray with a spirit of forgiveness.
[time=1978] God drive away from us, a spirit of accusation, a tone of rejection, an air of condemnation.
[time=1988] Help us today to sense that we are sinners, but we are saved by your grace and we thank you for your grace.
[time=1996] We would pray today that you would feed many who are in a time of extreme conflict and crises in their life, you would feed them with a word of wisdom.
[time=2006] We pray for Don in his family, for Tonya and her family, as they go through these difficult days, give them wisdom from above.
[time=2015] Father, through your word today, we would ask that you would teach and strengthen each one of us for it's in Christ's name that we pray. Amen.
[time=2025] I hope you have your Bible with you, and if you do, please open it to 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=2030] For about six weeks now, we've been studying this great chapter, the Bible, that's been called the love chapter because it speaks in nearly every verse about God's love and the love that God wants us to have and flow through us.
[time=2045] There are 16 descriptions of love, and we come to the last description.
[time=2050] Love never fails, but as we end with that phrase, love never fails, it begins to speak about other matters as well.
[time=2058] Please look as I read this for you.
[time=2061] 1 Corinthians 13 verse 8, "Love never fails, but where there are prophecies they will cease,
[time=2069] where there are tongues they will be stilled, where there is knowledge it will pass away,
[time=2076] for we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.
[time=2084] When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child,
[time=2092] when I became a man, I put away childish things.
[time=2097] Now we see, but a poor reflection, then we shall see face to face.
[time=2103] Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
[time=2110] And now these three remain, faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love.
[time=2120] Well as we conclude with, love never fails, we then enter into a whole 'nother conversation
[time=2126] about spiritual gifts.
[time=2128] I want to share with you that I am not sure that I can put my finger on another passage of the Bible that is more difficult to interpret than this one.
[time=2138] Over the past weeks in preparing for this, I've looked through literally dozens of commentaries
[time=2144] and not two of them are identical.
[time=2146] It's a little bit presumptuous for me to say then, since scholars have wrestled with this for two thousand years, I've got it all figured out, and aren't you lucky today to be the first to hear it?
[time=2157] I want to confess with you that this is a difficult passage yet.
[time=2161] I have come to a point of great conviction in my own thinking.
[time=2164] This will not be the easiest message for me to give or the easiest one for you to receive.
[time=2169] Reminds me of the time when we are studying through 1 Peter and we came to words like predestination
[time=2175] and foreordination.
[time=2176] Those are confusing terms.
[time=2178] Huckleberry Finn was drugged to church by the withered Douglas when his pastor spoke on these subjects.
[time=2184] He came home and said, "I don't know what that pre-fore or destination means, but the preacher sure got the folks worked up over it." Well, this is a difficult passage like those ones that speak about election and predestination.
[time=2199] When we spoke on that passage back in 1 Peter two years ago, the very next day I went to visit a cancer patient who was a very avid Bible hour viewer and an extended family member of our church.
[time=2211] I walked in the room and I said, "How are you doing today?" And she reflecting on the day before his message said, "I'm doing better today than you were doing yesterday."
[time=2222] She said, "Do you know I had called several friends and told them to watch the Bible hour that they had really liked it?
[time=2228] I had to call them back yesterday afternoon and tell them to give you a second chance, because you usually did better than that." Well, I hope today that you've got a sensitive heart because today we're going to have to think.
[time=2240] You just can't come today and watch.
[time=2242] You're going to have to think.
[time=2243] You got your thinking hats on?
[time=2245] Okay.
[time=2246] The Bible says, "Love never fails." That's the 16th description of the quality of love that God would have.
[time=2253] Now, when you and I hear that word fail, we usually put that in the context of athletics or achievement.
[time=2260] Failure versus success.
[time=2262] Yesterday, the Ohio State Buckeyes were a success.
[time=2266] The IU Hoosiers failed.
[time=2269] Well, that's how we think of that word success and failure.
[time=2273] But this word failure is not being used to distinguish it between that which is successful, that which is not successful.
[time=2280] It's actually talking about that which never ends.
[time=2284] It never fails.
[time=2285] It never stops.
[time=2287] There's a very popular phrase that says, "Love conquers all." Isn't that a nice thought?
[time=2294] It's a wonderful thought, but it's just not true.
[time=2296] Love doesn't conquer all.
[time=2299] Too often we come into a relationship saying, "I will act lovingly towards this other
[time=2305] person because I think that if I act lovingly, then they'll respond appropriately and I'll get what I want." But you know that you can be everything that this long list describes love to be
[time=2318] and still not be successful in winning that other person.
[time=2322] You see, David loved Absalom.
[time=2326] He loved Absalom, he was his son, but Absalom was a rebel.
[time=2331] And Absalom destroyed David's family, then he destroyed David's kingdom, and David still never stopped loving that son.
[time=2341] But he never won that son to his side again.
[time=2346] Isaiah loved Gomer.
[time=2348] Gomer was his wife.
[time=2350] Gomer was unfaithful.
[time=2352] He was sexually promiscuous.
[time=2356] She literally took her body to the streets and sold it.
[time=2360] Isaiah loved her.
[time=2362] That love couldn't win her back.
[time=2366] If love always won, then the Lord Jesus would have never died, because he was love in its perfect form, and yet the Bible says he was despised and rejected.
[time=2380] Love never fails.
[time=2383] I believe that teaches us this important, practical lesson that we are to keep on loving even when we're not winning.
[time=2392] Too often we are willing to enter into a relationship that says, "I'll do the loving thing towards you, but it better be pretty soon that you do the loving things towards me," or that's it.
[time=2406] This character of love says love, it never stops.
[time=2410] It keeps loving and loving and loving.
[time=2414] Someone said, and I fully understood their heart this past week, "Why should I love him after all he's done to me, and he'll never change?"
[time=2426] I don't know that he'll never change, but you could very well be right.
[time=2429] So why should she love him?
[time=2432] Let me share with you three reasons why our love should never fail.
[time=2437] Reason number one is it pleases God.
[time=2440] The way you're made and the way I made my instincts tell me to do what pleases me, and yet the Bible says that our ethic is not to be what is it that pleases
[time=2451] me, but my ethic is what is it that pleases God?
[time=2456] Secondly, when we love the unlovely, when we love that one who has hurt us,
[time=2462] it pleases the Heavenly Father, and he looks to us and he says, "Well done.
[time=2468] Thou good and faithful servant. Well done." It's his will for your life, for mine.
[time=2476] Secondly, when we love, even when we're not being successful at winning that other person, it not only pleases God, but secondly, what it produces Godliness in our lives.
[time=2489] Galatians 5 verse 22 begins to list the description that God wants to be descriptive of our life.
[time=2496] If we were to describe you, how would you be described today?
[time=2499] Five, eight, and three quarters.
[time=2502] Brown hair, blue eyes.
[time=2505] That's my description.
[time=2507] Thirty-three years old, born in Akron, Ohio.
[time=2511] Graduate of a certain high school, graduate of another college, that becomes a description.
[time=2516] You know, God's not interested in that description.
[time=2518] God doesn't care where you're born, how tall you are, what athletic ability you possess, what musical talents you have.
[time=2525] God says, "Here's the description." When somebody says, "What does that person like?" God says, "I want it to be this way." He's loving.
[time=2533] He's peaceful.
[time=2534] He's joyful.
[time=2536] It's got a lot of self-control.
[time=2538] An amazing measure of faith.
[time=2542] That's what God says.
[time=2544] You see, when we love, even when we're losing, it produces godliness in our
[time=2550] life, and it pleases the Heavenly Father.
[time=2553] A third reason is this.
[time=2555] It not only pleases God, produces godliness, but it protects us.
[time=2562] It protects you.
[time=2564] You see, if somebody does an injury to you, if they break your trust, if your son is rebellious beyond your worst nightmare, if your business partner has undercut you, if your boss has misrepresented you, you have been unfairly treated.
[time=2586] That's already one hurt.
[time=2589] But if you do not forgive them and never fail to love them, you will grow bitter.
[time=2596] And that bitterness will never hurt that other person, but it will hurt you.
[time=2602] Hebrews, chapter 12, verse 15, I commend to your reading.
[time=2607] It says to this, "See to it that no one failed by the grace of God and that no root of bitterness spring up in you and by it many be defiled." I don't know whether you are about your front yard like I am about my front yard.
[time=2623] I agree with Irma Bombek. Our front yard is our statement to the world of who we are.
[time=2629] I don't know if your statement to the world occasionally has dandelions covering it, but mine does.
[time=2636] And it will do you no good to run around picking off the yellow flowers.
[time=2642] It won't do you any good to go and to take that broad leaf and to grab all six or seven of those leaves and to rip them off because down under the ground is this root.
[time=2653] And no matter how many times you cut that top off, pick that flower off, that root is there and it will spring up again and again and again.
[time=2663] It has to be taken out by the root.
[time=2666] And if that dandelion isn't pulled out by the root, then when that flower comes off and goes to seed, it will cover your yard and more will come up.
[time=2677] Sometimes bitterness sinks deep into our lives and its root is down there
[time=2686] and we gloss it over with nice little phrases.
[time=2690] That's like pulling the flower off. No one sees it.
[time=2694] It's like taking the leaves and ripping them off, but we've never dealt with the root.
[time=2701] And that root will be in there and it will simply grow back and pop up again and again and again.
[time=2709] And that root will go to seed and pollute other lives as well.
[time=2714] Bitterness is more contagious than any disease that we could ever communicate to each other.
[time=2720] And you see, when we fail to love, a root of bitterness is in our life.
[time=2727] And that root of bitterness will never hurt the person who hurt us.
[time=2732] It will only hurt us.
[time=2735] We'll be tied up in emotional knots.
[time=2738] They won't even know about it.
[time=2740] We'll be steaming with anger. They're unaware of it.
[time=2744] We will destroy our health. They'll feel great.
[time=2748] We'll be an emotional wreck. They'll be fine.
[time=2753] Bitterness never hurts them. It only hurts us.
[time=2757] And we've got to remember that love never fails.
[time=2761] Never comes to a time when it doesn't end.
[time=2764] It's not saying love is always successful.
[time=2767] Love always wins the other person.
[time=2769] Love always triumphs in the end.
[time=2771] Unless you mean the judgment day by the end, it doesn't always triumph.
[time=2776] But it keeps going.
[time=2779] Love never fails.
[time=2785] There was a time in history when God spoke through prophets and gave us His inspired word.
[time=2792] But He doesn't do that anymore.
[time=2795] There was a time when God walked on the earth in the person of Jesus Christ, but He's not doing that anymore.
[time=2803] There was a time when God required animal sacrifices, but He's not doing that anymore.
[time=2811] But there was a time when God said, "I love you, and I sent my son to die for you,
[time=2819] and that time never ends." Love never ends.
[time=2825] Got that? That's the easy part. Ready for the tough part?
[time=2830] Not only does He say love never fails, but now He says there are some things that will fail.
[time=2835] Verse 8, "But where there are prophecies, they will cease.
[time=2840] Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.
[time=2843] Where there is knowledge, it will pass away." He's referring to three particular spiritual gifts.
[time=2851] Prophecy, tongues, knowledge.
[time=2854] Let me in a very summary way describe what those gifts are.
[time=2857] The gift of prophecy was when God had a message, and He revealed it to the mind of a prophet,
[time=2865] and that man or woman then revealed it to the people of God.
[time=2870] It was inspired by God.
[time=2872] It wasn't just a good song.
[time=2874] It wasn't just beautiful poetry. It wasn't a fine message.
[time=2877] It was actually from God to the prophet, from the prophet to the people.
[time=2882] Now the gift of knowledge was a companion to prophecy that God enabled His prophets to know things they could never know unless God told them that.
[time=2893] Joseph would have never known that Mary was pregnant of the Holy Ghost if God had not told Him.
[time=2901] That was a word of knowledge.
[time=2903] By the same token, the Old Testament figure, Joseph would have never known Pharaoh's dream or its interpretation unless God gave him a word of knowledge.
[time=2913] It was God supernaturally telling a man or woman what they could never know through human experience.
[time=2921] Tongues was that ability demonstrated on the day of Pentecost for an unlearned, ignorant man who never studied any language who only spoke his native tongue to be able to instantly communicate to a group of people on the day of Pentecost in a language they had never heard before.
[time=2939] That was the gift of tongues.
[time=2941] Now what are you saying here is that love never fails, it's going to keep on going, there's never a time when love is out of date, but there is a time when these gifts are going to end.
[time=2953] Now the question of course is when did these gifts end or if they haven't ended as some would suggest, when will they end?
[time=2961] Now comes the tough part.
[time=2963] Okay, ready for a little grammar lesson, one who should be in grammar class is now about to teach you grammar.
[time=2971] There are two verbs here.
[time=2974] First it says, prophecy is going to cease, that's one verb, and then later in the verse it says, knowledge will pass away, that's the exact same word that's being used there.
[time=2987] That word is in a unique voice of the Greek language called the passive voice.
[time=2993] Now when you and I hear voice we usually think you mean soprano, alto, bass, tenor, not at all.
[time=2999] Voice and grammar actually means who's doing the action versus who's receiving it.
[time=3004] Let me illustrate for you.
[time=3006] If we said, Rick hit the ball, you would say that's a miracle, but just follow, Rick hit the ball.
[time=3012] Rick is the subject, hit is the verb, Rick the subject did the hitting, that's active voice.
[time=3020] Got that?
[time=3021] Now if I say the ball was hit by Rick, the ball's the subject, hit still the verb, but the ball wasn't doing the hitting, it was being hit.
[time=3031] That's called passive voice.
[time=3033] That's when the subject is receiving the action rather than doing the action.
[time=3038] Does that make sense?
[time=3040] Great, one person said yes, I'm going to bank on that person's judgment.
[time=3045] Now how does this apply to what we're studying so far?
[time=3048] You see this verse is saying that prophecy and knowledge will be brought to an end.
[time=3055] Obviously it's saying God will bring these to an end.
[time=3060] God's in control, he will bring these gifts to an end.
[time=3064] Now there's a different verb that is used though when it says tongues will be stilled, they'll be silenced.
[time=3072] That verb there is not only a different verb but it's in a different voice.
[time=3076] Now I really confuse you, it's not active.
[time=3079] You say oh it's passive again right?
[time=3081] No it's not passive.
[time=3083] It's in what the Greek language calls a middle voice.
[time=3087] Allow me to explain middle voice to you.
[time=3090] We've got a three year old little boy who needs at least one if not two to three baths a day.
[time=3096] Now I can say an active voice.
[time=3099] Adam, I'm messing it up here, let me back up.
[time=3105] I gave Adam a bath.
[time=3108] I'm doing it to Adam, I'm the subject that's active.
[time=3113] I can say Adam was given a bath.
[time=3116] Adam's now the subject but he didn't do the action, I still gave him the bath.
[time=3121] That's passive.
[time=3123] If I said Adam gave himself a bath that's called a national disaster.
[time=3129] That's the middle voice.
[time=3132] The middle voice is when someone or something does it to themselves.
[time=3137] Active you're doing it, passive it's being done to you, the middle you're doing it to yourself.
[time=3142] Now how is that important? This verse is saying that tongues will bring themselves to an end.
[time=3149] They'll cease of their own power.
[time=3153] I believe the best illustration of that is like a battery.
[time=3157] No matter what kind of battery you buy, you may buy a die hard, you may buy a delco freedom battery,
[time=3163] you may buy a freedom battery too, you may buy an ever ready battery, your die hard will die, your freedom will fail you, and your ever ready will not always be ready.
[time=3176] Batteries only have a limited power and a limited lifetime, a limited usage.
[time=3183] And then that battery brings itself to an end.
[time=3187] That's what God is saying here, tongues will bring themselves to an end.
[time=3193] The question is when is that? And if you'll come to our Sunday evening service tonight,
[time=3199] we have slides, not slides, transparencies, notes.
[time=3202] We're going to cover this for a fourth, full 30 minutes.
[time=3206] But let me just share this with you. I believe the tongues were coming to an end at the very time.
[time=3210] Paul wrote this in about 55 to 60 A.D. Now why do I think that? Just very quickly, I'll tell you why.
[time=3218] First of all, do you know this is the last reference in the Bible to tongues? Chronologically, this is the last reference to tongues.
[time=3226] All of the other lists of spiritual gifts that were written later don't include tongues.
[time=3231] And all of the Bible that was written later which is most of the Bible never mentions tongues.
[time=3238] Why? Because they were coming to an end because they had fulfilled the purpose for which God intended them.
[time=3244] This verse is saying, tongues will bring themselves to an end. That was right when Paul was saying it.
[time=3250] Now he goes on further though to talk about prophecy and knowledge. This even gets trickier, you're going to love this stuff.
[time=3257] Love never fails but where there is prophecy and knowledge they're going to be brought to an end.
[time=3263] Now when is that? Verse 9 says this, "For now we know in part." That makes sense, that's easy.
[time=3271] They only had partial knowledge and partial revelation. Why did they only have partial?
[time=3276] Because this was one of the first letters that was ever written in the New Testament. One of the very earliest letters.
[time=3282] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts were not written when 1 Corinthians was written.
[time=3287] Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1st and 2nd Peter, 1st, 2nd and 3rd John, Judon Revelation, none of those were written.
[time=3298] So what he's saying to the Corinthians, you have prophecy and knowledge and that's given you part.
[time=3303] But when the perfect, which also means complete, comes, then the partial will be done away with.
[time=3310] You know what I think he's saying there? It's really simple. He's saying you've got spiritual gifts and they're giving you part of the revelation.
[time=3316] But when the completed revelation comes, the spiritual gifts, the part passes away.
[time=3321] Make sense? Say yes, even if it doesn't. God, you're saying yes. Thanks, Jim.
[time=3326] Alright, now he even takes knowledge a step further though.
[time=3331] He says, verse 11, "When I was a child, I talked like a child. I thought like a child. I reasoned like a child.
[time=3337] When I became a man, I put away childish things.
[time=3340] I probably should have read that verse a long time ago because there's still quite a few childish things I've yet to put away.
[time=3346] My brother-in-law, who's even older than I am, has a sweatshirt that says it's never too late to have a happy childhood.
[time=3353] Isn't that great? We take my kids and his kids out to a farm market where they have bundles and bundles of hay and crawl around for two hours.
[time=3362] Kids don't like it, but we have a great time.
[time=3365] Childish things. Now that's not saying there's anything wrong with childish things.
[time=3370] It's just simply saying when you're a child, you play with certain things.
[time=3373] When you get a little older, you play with different things. When you get a little older, your toys get real expensive, don't they?
[time=3380] We progress through life. There is growth that takes place. We begin to think different. We begin to reason different.
[time=3387] My kids say, "I want it. I say how much is it?" You see how the mind works completely different?
[time=3393] Now what he is saying is when the church was in its infancy, it was dependent upon spiritual gifts.
[time=3400] But once those gifts had brought about the Word of God, now the church could stand on the Word of God, the completed revelation.
[time=3408] I'd like to call that adolescence if you'll let me.
[time=3411] And yet even though God's Word is complete, our understanding of it is not complete.
[time=3417] There is nobody that I even heard say, "I understand every part of the Bible. Ask me any question."
[time=3424] We don't understand it completely and we'll never know that until we see Jesus face to face, then we'll know everything.
[time=3431] So there's a threefold progression. There's the infancy of dependent upon revelatory gifts, then there's the adolescence of depending upon the Word,
[time=3440] and finally we're in heaven with Christ and we say, "That's what it means when our knowledge is complete."
[time=3447] Now let's try to draw practical truth. Other than saying these gifts have passed away, these gifts have remained.
[time=3454] Love has remained. What is the bottom line that he's trying to say here? Verse 13.
[time=3459] And now these three remain. Faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love.
[time=3470] I think what God's saying here is rather than us always belabor the theology and the knowledge that there ought to be character in our life.
[time=3479] It ought to be marked first of all by faith, that we receive Jesus Christ as Savior and we order our thinking in the faith of the Word of God,
[time=3488] that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.
[time=3492] Secondly, that we live a vibrant hope, that we take God at His Word. We not only believe it, but we expect it to come true.
[time=3499] Every promise we live with hope. And finally, that we're controlled by God's love.
[time=3504] For you today, aware of the fact that God loves you, that He's sent Christ to die for you, and you can receive Him as Savior.
[time=3520] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music through celebration and soloist, Kerry Johnson, and the ministry of God's Word from our pastor, Rick Hawks.

[time=3538] Will you pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3547] Today I sense the need for Christ to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me.
[time=3552] I ask you to do that now. In your name I pray, amen.
