[time=110] A number of years ago, an S-4 submarine was struck by another ship off of the coast of Massachusetts, almost instantly the submarine sank.
[time=123] In a rear compartment were a small number of crew members desperately waiting to be rescued.
[time=130] When divers entered into the water and put their helmet against the side of the submarine, they could hear one of the crew member tapping in Morris code.
[time=139] Is there any hope? Is there any hope?
[time=148] Listen today and you'll hear the beating of a generation saying, "Is there any hope?"
[time=158] [MUSIC]
[time=169] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour. We're glad you've joined us.
[time=177] Today Rick's message is entitled, "Is There Any Hope?" and is taken from Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=183] As you may be aware, Black Hawk Baptist Church is planning to build a new large sanctuary and supporting facilities.
[time=191] Today Rick's message asks the question, "Why should we build a new church?" From Ephesians 2 comes the answer, because Christ is the hope of the world.
[time=200] Stay with us now, not for a building program presentation, but for a study of God's Word about His Son, Jesus Christ, the hope of the world.
[time=210] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Ephesians chapter 2. We will be looking at verses 11 through 13.
[time=219] Music today will be provided by the sanctuary choir.
[time=224] It worships.
[time=226] And our special guest soloist is recording artist Lana Young.
[time=231] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=243] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=248] Now here's Rick.
[time=250] Welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour. We trust both to them who join us by television and to you who are here, that they'll come a sense of great love for God.
[time=261] When you realize the amazing love with which He has loved us, Charles Wesley also wrote that Him and can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's name.
[time=273] Our choir sings that majestic anthem of praise for us today, and I hope it nits your hearts together as one in praising the Lord.
[time=303] He left His Father's throne of life so free, so open, and His grace, and His Son of all.
[time=332] O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave and the home of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=635] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=665] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=801] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=830] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=917] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=946] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=1004] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=1034] O'er in the midst of a financial campaign it's great to allow David and Sally to remind us of the attitudes that we want to have in celebrating God's grace during this time and keeping our eyes fixed on the Lord Jesus Christ and what he'd have us to do as Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1052] We can rejoice today that we stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene and wonder how he could love us.
[time=1058] A sinner condemned unclean but he does doesn't he.
[time=1067] May he save your love.
[time=1081] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=1195] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1213] O'er the land of the brave and the home of the brave and the home of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=1360] Thank you again for joining us today, for the Bible Hour.
[time=1365] You've already met our special guest, Lanna Young, and we're certainly delighted to have her here with us today.
[time=1371] Yes, Rick, Lanna is from Hillsdale, Michigan. She was here just a few years ago.
[time=1375] She's only 15 years old, but does a tremendous job in ministering through music.
[time=1379] Well, I'm excited to have her back. I remember her from her previous visits.
[time=1383] It was so impressed not only with her talent as a young lady, but the sincerity from which she spoke from her heart.
[time=1389] I think that's the combination that we here at Blackhawk are looking for.
[time=1392] And on the Bible Hour, we like to present people that really show forth the love of Christ through their music.
[time=1397] And if you're watching us today, we'd like to encourage you to come to the Blackhawk Baptist Church tonight.
[time=1402] At 6 p.m. where Lanna will be presenting a concert, you'll enjoy it.
[time=1406] Try to make a point to join us for our evening service.
[time=1409] I would like to add to Pete's encouragement, my invitation for you to be with us tonight at 6.
[time=1414] Our services in the evening are a little less structured, a little more informal.
[time=1419] We relax and have a great time celebrating and worshiping the Lord.
[time=1423] Along with Lanna singing, we'll have a Bible study. We'd love to have you as a part of that.
[time=1429] Well, Lanna's here today, but we start the living Christmas tree very soon.
[time=1433] We've already begun to work on the music. We have our retreat this weekend.
[time=1437] We spend some eight hours on music and fellowship during the weekend.
[time=1441] And that's really the kickoff for our preparation for the 14 concerts that we'll be doing in December.
[time=1447] And what will the theme be for this year's living Christmas tree?
[time=1450] The title this year is Everlasting Light. And in timeless insights, you know, we've been studying in the Book of Matthew.
[time=1456] And the musical really takes his text again from the story of Jesus Christ being born of Mary.
[time=1463] And the purpose for him coming was to save us from our sins and to allow us then as Christians to be the light of the world.
[time=1469] And he has a tremendous message. And the theme is Everlasting Light.
[time=1473] Well, I hope that you can be a part of this year's living Christmas tree.
[time=1477] And when literature becomes available through the mail or in the newspaper, please do act quickly upon that
[time=1483] so that you don't miss out in the 1986 living Christmas tree.
[time=1487] Pete did just mention timeless insights. And we from time to time mentioned that to you
[time=1493] because there is nothing that we could say or do that would be more important than getting you into the habit of studying God's Word.
[time=1502] The Bible says of itself, "Faith comes by hearing and hearing by God's Word." God has no other plan for your spiritual growth or mine than through a study of His Word.
[time=1513] If you're like me, you need help from time to time to know what to study and exactly how to systematically plan our daily devotions.
[time=1522] Some of us make the habit of opening up our Bible and just reading those passages to ourselves that we like.
[time=1529] But we miss so much of God's Word by just going back to the familiar.
[time=1533] Timeless Insights guides us through the New Testament in one year starting with Matthew ending with Revelation, a study of God's Word.
[time=1542] It's a Bible study tool that you'll want to have and we want to send to you absolutely free for your trial.
[time=1549] If you'll simply write to us today, we'll send you a copy.
[time=1553] You can receive timeless insights by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1562] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1569] Again, we want to invite you to be a part of not only this broadcast but our evening service with Lana Young.
[time=1576] We would love to see you in person. Thank you for joining us today and we hope that your hearts and your Bibles are both open.
[time=1583] As we study God's Word, each of us will take the next step of spiritual growth in our life.
[time=1589] Thank you again for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1606] I got a call from an old friend. We laughed about how we had changed, but I could tell things weren't going as well as he claimed.
[time=1626] He tried to hide his feelings, but they only gave him away.
[time=1635] The longer I listened, the more I kept wishing that I knew the right words to say.
[time=1645] Can you reach my friend? You're the only one who can. Lord, I know you love him. Make him understand.
[time=1664] Can you reach my friend? Bring his searching to an end. Help him give his heart to you.
[time=1683] We talk more than an hour. Smile when he mentioned your name. I said that I knew you and told him the difference you'd make.
[time=1702] He never thought he would need you. Maybe he's changing his mind. As we said goodbye, Lord, he told me that I had found something he'd like to find.
[time=1720] Can you reach my friend? You're the only one who can. Lord, I know you love him. Make him understand.
[time=1739] Can you reach my friend? Bring his searching to an end. Help him give his heart.
[time=1752] Because maybe he's ready to help. Lord, he said that he might need to call on you.
[time=1772] Can you reach my friend? You're the only one who can. Lord, I know you love him. Make him understand.
[time=1790] Can you reach my friend? Bring his searching to an end. Help him give his heart to you.
[time=1809] Help him give his heart to you.
[time=1825] Thank you, Lana. She'll sing again in the moment, but I have two words of announcement, one of great joy and one of great concern to share with you.
[time=1835] Start off with the announcement of great joy. At the time we did our budget this past year, we made plans financially to allow the church to employ one more pastor to serve in the church in a variety of ways.
[time=1848] During the middle of the year as a staff and Deacon team, we reviewed that and came up with a plan of hiring rather than a person to work full-time, several people who could work with us part-time, and that's largely because we are so Sunday intensive.
[time=1864] We just don't have a lot of programs that run Monday from one o'clock to three o'clock in the afternoon, but we need everybody who's alive and breathing that we can get on Sunday mornings and Sunday nights.
[time=1875] We came up with a plan of identifying some part-time areas of responsibility.
[time=1881] One month ago, Jim Pearson began to work part-time with children, and today I'm pleased to announce that Mark Clough, who is a part of our church for a number of years, is going to be working with us part-time
[time=1892] as the coordinator of our adult Bible fellowships. He'll be working with the Sunday school teachers and the Deacons to help develop that flock ministry stronger and stronger to keep our large church growing small and more intimate.
[time=1907] In many ways, Mark is one of the pioneers of the flock ministry because when it began, he was a Deacon in our church and provided some of the keen wisdom and leadership.
[time=1916] And Mark is the head of the guidance department at Snyder High School, and is going to sneak a few hours in after school to be of help to us.
[time=1923] We're certainly thankful for Mark's willingness to serve the body of Christ in that way.
[time=1928] On a more unfortunate note, I would like to ask you to be praying particularly for Lois Clancy.
[time=1934] Lois is a part of our church. She sings in our choir. She teaches in our school.
[time=1939] And about three weeks ago, she had a kidney transplant. The tissue was a 100% match from her brother, but right now she is going through a process of rejection.
[time=1950] We would want you to pray very specifically for that, and not only for that, but she's down in Indianapolis and she is alone.
[time=1958] So if you're thinking, boy, how to write somebody a note, make it Lois. If you can go to Indianapolis, she would love a visit, but we want to pray for Lois.
[time=1966] So before Lana comes and sings again, I'm going to ask Mark who's just joining us as a staff member now to lead us in prayer as we pray for Lois.
[time=1976] Let's pray again, please.
[time=1979] Dear Father, we know that you're the great physician.
[time=1983] And at a very special time in Lois's life, we ask that you would reach down and help that body to be, help that kidney to be assimilated into that body.
[time=1995] So that you would have the honor and the glory for her healing.
[time=2000] Father, we thank you that you are a person who cares about each one of us individually. You love us.
[time=2007] We would want to show our love for Lois today by praying for her and meeting for her needs and for the needs of her family.
[time=2017] Your son's name, we pray. Amen.
[time=2025] Oh, oh my God. Oh, oh my God. Oh, oh my God. Oh, oh my God.
[time=2050] Oh, oh my God.
[time=2059] When I in awesome wonder, consider all all the worlds thy hands have made.
[time=2077] I see the stars. I hear the rolling thunder.
[time=2090] Thy power throughout, thy universe displayed.
[time=2103] Then sings my soul. I save your God today. How great thou art.
[time=2121] How great thou art. Then sings my soul. I save your God today.
[time=2138] How great thou art. How great thou art.
[time=2157] When I think that God his son, not sparing, sent him to die.
[time=2174] I skips can't take it away, let on the cross.
[time=2189] My burden gladly buried, he bled and died, to take away my sin.
[time=2207] When I shall call, we shall direct the mission and take me home.
[time=2227] To join self in my heart, when I share my soul.
[time=2239] Being humble, let a race shine.
[time=2255] How great thou art. Then sings my soul. I save your God today.
[time=2297] How great thou art. Then sings my soul.
[time=2318] How great thou art.
[time=2364] Someone asked me, "Why is it at Black Hawk?" "You clap. Is it because you want the entertainer to know you think they have talent?"
[time=2372] We certainly have an ear and an eye for talent. We recognize that, but that's not why we clap.
[time=2379] We clap because we want to say, "We agree." We just heard a song that speaks of the greatness of our God in a great way, and we just can't sit there and just smile back.
[time=2390] There's got to be a sense, and a way that we can say, "Yes, God we agree." How great thou art.
[time=2397] And God we do love you today, and we declare that you are God, and that you are our great God.
[time=2404] And that song that you gave to us is a theme song that we would sing Sunday by Sunday speaks of your faithfulness to us day by day.
[time=2415] How great thou art. Lord we love you, and we meet today in our humble hearts to take what we have by time.
[time=2425] By musical talent, by teaching skills with children, by greeting a friend to say that we love you, and that you are our God.
[time=2436] And apart from you we are hopeless, but in Christ we have the hope of the world.
[time=2442] We today want to see Him in the pages of Scripture, the hope of the world, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=2452] A number of years ago, right off the coast of Massachusetts during peacetime, an S-4 submarine collided with another large ship, puncturing the side of the submarine and it almost instantly sank to the bottom of the ocean.
[time=2469] A number of crew members were trapped in an airtight compartment in the back of that submarine.
[time=2475] As rescue teams made their best efforts, one diver went down and put the side of his diving helmet against the side of that submarine and he could hear some tapping.
[time=2487] He recognized the tapping as a definitive message that was given in Morse code.
[time=2493] The diver understood Morse code and the message that was being repetitiously tapped was this.
[time=2500] Is there any hope? Is there any hope? I invite you to listen with me to the tapping of this generation.
[time=2517] As the voices of all parts of our society cry out, is there any hope? Is there any hope?
[time=2531] May I share it with you today that the Scripture says that in Jesus Christ there is hope, there is hope.
[time=2540] Our congressman Dan Coates was speaking to a group of leaders in our community, the Association of Non-Public Schools.
[time=2548] He gave this report that amongst all the facilities across our nation, one particular facility was noted for its success in working with adolescents who were struggling with drug and alcohol.
[time=2564] And so a congressional committee went to investigate this one particular facility and as they interviewed students at this facility, they were very disheartened.
[time=2575] Because all of the dollars of government, all of the wisdom of man, all of the programming skills that were available, and this was the finest gave to them this report.
[time=2587] Student after student gave the word and the impression that when they left that institute, they were waiting to get home to go back to the same lifestyle from which they had just been rescued.
[time=2600] That was the report again and again and again. Until congressman Coates came to this one individual who gave just the opposite report.
[time=2609] This student said that when I'm out of here, I'm going to have a completely different life. I'm looking forward to going home and being changed.
[time=2618] Student was asked why is it that you have that hope? He said because one of the counselors here was helping me and the counselor told me how if I asked Jesus Christ to come into my life, he would forgive me and give me new life and I found that to be true.
[time=2634] There is hope. Jesus Christ changes lives.
[time=2640] Open your Bibles if you will to Ephesians chapter two and we'll study there today that Jesus Christ is the hope and the only hope for all of the world.
[time=2653] We have departed from our study of first Corinthians and we're going to be asking ourselves some very probing questions these next four or five weeks.
[time=2662] The probing questions are these. Why should we build a new larger church and how should we build it?
[time=2672] I believe we need to answer those questions. Before we take another step, why is it that we're endeavoring to build a new church?
[time=2680] Is it because we're bored with a gymnasium, with lights, baskets, we look at overflow rooms and we say that's not good enough?
[time=2688] That is not at all why. We can live in a gym forever. But the reason why we need to build a new large auditorium is this single reason.
[time=2697] Jesus Christ is the only hope of the world and that new facility is going to facilitate us spreading that message.
[time=2707] And if that's not true, we need to stop the machinery right now. Hebrews, or excuse me, Ephesians chapter two verses 11, 12, and 13.
[time=2720] Therefore, remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that, which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands.
[time=2737] That at that time, ye were without Christ. Being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, having no hope, and without God in the world.
[time=2762] But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who were, sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
[time=2773] I don't know of a passage in all the Scripture that speaks more clearly of the fact that we are either in the world or we are in Christ, and if we are not in Christ, we are without hope and we are without God.
[time=2789] The Bible speaks in very high contrast. The Bible says that we are either alive in Christ or dead in our trespasses and sins.
[time=2799] That's Ephesians two, verse one. It says, you who were dead in trespasses and sins, he has made alive in Christ. Are you dead spiritually? Are you alive?
[time=2814] You know, there's no middle ground with that. You're either dead or you're alive spiritually, which is it today? High contrast, dead or alive.
[time=2824] He said, you are either a far off from God or you can be made very near. You are either lost, not that you don't know your own way home, but you don't know your way to heaven or you're saved.
[time=2841] That is rescued from that lostness. You are either in the world. That whole system of thought and philosophy are you are either in Christ. High contrast.
[time=2860] And the only hope of going from dead and lost to alive and saved, the only hope is Jesus Christ. Look at verse 14. It says, "For He Christ is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall partition between us."
[time=2887] Now in the previous verses, he was describing Jews and Gentiles. But before we get all tied up in that ethnic description of backgrounds and of heritage and of lineage and of race, don't understand it in that concept.
[time=2903] Because Romans chapter 2 verse 28 makes this keen point. They are not all Israel who are Israel of the flesh. What? Verse 29. But they are all Jews who are Jews of the heart.
[time=2920] Now what was Paul trying to say there? Is that a head scratching situation? He's trying to say, being a Hebrew of the Old Testament was not a man's birthright.
[time=2932] But it was a person's spiritual position that you could be born a Jew but be of heart, not a believer. You could be born a Gentile but be born of an ethnic background that's different but be spiritually alive in the heart.
[time=2951] Now verse 14 talks about Jews, Gentiles, and it says there is a middle wall of partition. Let me describe that for you. In the temple that Herod built, of which Paul was writing about, the temple had four sections.
[time=2969] Over here is the innermost court called the courts of the priests and only the priests could go in there. Nobody else could go. Jew, Gentile, man, woman, nobody but the priests.
[time=2984] But outside that was an outer court. Not only could priests go into this outer court, the court of Israel, but so could all Jewish men. They could enter in. But women and non-Jews could not enter in to that second area.
[time=3003] Outside of that second area was an even larger area called the court of the women, but only Jewish women could go into that court. And if you were not a Jew, you could not enter in to that court.
[time=3019] Between that court of the women and the court of the Gentiles was a wall called the middle wall of partition. Archaeological digs have revealed a great deal of insight about this wall.
[time=3035] When you left the court of the women, you went down five steps before you approached that wall. The wall itself was somewhere between one and a half and two cubits thick. Call it five feet.
[time=3052] And as you went through that wall, you then descended another 14 steps down to get to the court of the Gentiles so that if you, most of us here are, are non-Jewish in our background.
[time=3070] The closest we could come to this point of worship is the court of the Gentiles and in front of us separating us is a wall 14 steps above our height, five feet thick separating us.
[time=3087] And that wall stood as a physical visualization of a spiritual truth that mankind was separated from God.
[time=3101] Now go back to verse 11. It speaks of time then and verse 13 of time now. Verse 11 says, "Remember that in time pass Gentiles." Verse 12, that at that time you were.
[time=3120] Of course those are past tense. Verse 13 says, "But now in Christ." That middle wall has been broken down.
[time=3131] And you see, God used that wall as not a statement about Jews and non-Jews, but a statement about those who are separated from God.
[time=3142] And he describes those people who are separated from God in verse 12. They are without Christ being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel.
[time=3154] You see, God before Christ was trying to speak to all of humanity through one nation. He would reveal his word to prophets, from prophets to those people and those people to the world.
[time=3169] But if you didn't become a believer in those promises, then you were aliens. You were outsiders. You were separated from God.
[time=3181] Not only were you aliens from that ethnic group of Israel, but that spiritual group of believers, but you were also strangers from the promise of the covenant.
[time=3194] That meant you had no idea that there was hope for you. That was information that had been kept from you. It was strange to you.
[time=3204] Have you listened to the news since yesterday? Congress has passed a lenient, gracious law allowing those who were illegal aliens into this country before 1982 are now legal aliens.
[time=3218] And news has now going out and interviewing these people and they're finding out they're now legal here and the freedom and the release because they discovered that they've been included.
[time=3230] That's what was happening here spiritually. There were people who were alienated from God, but God is reaching out in Christ and wants to include them.
[time=3240] That was their condition and the consequences those conditions follow it says, and they being strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope.
[time=3254] They had no hope of ever knowing God, of ever knowing forgiveness, of ever knowing the assurance of eternal life, of ever knowing Christ living in them, giving them power and purpose in life today.
[time=3267] They had no hope.
[time=3270] History records the hopelessness of humanity. The study of the classics brings to us Greek literature. And of all Greek literature, the literature that is most highest elevated is the literature of the Greeks called the tragedies.
[time=3291] You see the Greek playwrights did not write about visions of future and glory and hopeful prospects. Antigone speaks of being caught in a trap, inescapable the fates are in control.
[time=3306] Oedipus Rex speaks of a man who is always trying to do the right thing, but it ends in tragedy. Hopelessness.
[time=3317] And like the Greek Shakespeare, whom World Book Encyclopedia gives more pages to than any other topic or person is again most famous for his tragic writing of the hopelessness of humanity.
[time=3332] Macbeth, tempest, tragedies. Listen to this line from Shakespeare late in his life as he wrote about his view of life in the tempest.
[time=3344] The cloud-caped towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, yay all which it inherit shall dissolve.
[time=3360] And like this and substantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made of.
[time=3375] Our little life itself is rounded with a sleep.
[time=3383] Whether you look at the great palaces that mankind builds, the temples, the towers, or this globe, or your life or mine, Shakespeare said, it's insubstantial, and it all vanishes to nothing like a sleep.
[time=3402] Ten years ago, a contemporary music group by the name of Kansas wrote a song with this title, Dust in the Wind.
[time=3414] All we are is endless dust blowing in the wind.
[time=3421] You see, apart from Christ, there is no hope. There's absolutely none.
[time=3428] You see, without hope, and then secondly, without God.
[time=3434] You see, there's no hope because there's no God. If there's no God who made you and me, then there's no purpose to life or accidents.
[time=3443] And if there's no God, there's no ethic to live by. We just go by our feelings.
[time=3448] And if there is no God, there is no thing after this.
[time=3456] We are, as the title of a popular television show of the 60s, lost in space without hope.
[time=3467] But look at verse 13. It says, "But now in Christ Jesus, those who were once a far off, aliens separated, now have been brought near."
[time=3478] How? By the blood of Jesus Christ, that when Christ died on the cross for our sins, he made a sacrifice of himself that steps over and breaks down that wall of partition and brings us to Christ and gives us the hope of eternal life.
[time=3500] That's the hope of the world, Jesus Christ.
[time=3518] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our special guest, Lanna Young, and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3526] Just before we close today, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3531] If you've made a decision today concerning Christ in your life, I'd like to have you bow your heads and pray with me.
[time=3538] Heavenly Father, I thank you for this day, and I thank you for the fact that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3547] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3555] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3559] If you've made a decision today and you prayed that prayer with me, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3565] And then when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Your Decision to Help You Get Started in Your Spiritual Walk with God."
