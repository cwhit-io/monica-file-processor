[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=90] This past year Kathy and I have had the privilege of being on several different mission fields.
[time=108] One that comes to my mind is a country where only 1% of the entire populace know Jesus Christ
[time=115] is their personal Savior and are a part of an evangelical Bible teaching church.
[time=120] That was the first mission stop we made in the country of Japan.
[time=124] One of the last mission stops we made was very similar.
[time=128] Here the situation was only slightly better.
[time=131] Only 2% of the entire population of this community attended a Bible teaching church.
[time=138] That community was not located in Asia or Africa.
[time=142] That was Bible town, community church in Boca Raton, Florida.
[time=147] And in the counties of southeast Florida only 2% of the people know Jesus Christ is their Savior
[time=154] and are attending a Bible teaching church.
[time=157] That's why here in America we must build new churches.
[time=162] (music)
[time=173] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=179] We're glad you've chosen to spend part of this Lord's Day with us.
[time=182] Today Rick's message is taken from Acts chapter 2 and is entitled "Why Should We Build a New Church?"
[time=190] Francis Shafer said, "We are living in a post-Christian era.
[time=194] We must continue to keep our focus on world missions, but must also double our efforts of evangelism and church growth in our own culture.
[time=204] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Acts chapter 2.
[time=209] We will be looking at verses 37 through 42.
[time=213] Special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir.
[time=217] (music) We'll also be hearing from Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=225] (music) The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=236] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=240] Now here's Rick.
[time=242] Good morning and welcome and welcome to our friends who are joining us for the Bible hour.
[time=247] This is a Sunday morning that I've been looking forward to for several weeks.
[time=252] I love everything we do musically, but I have been prepared ahead of time for the song "The Choir is Singing Today"
[time=259] and with anticipation I've been humming the tune around the house.
[time=263] Kathy's been singing it.
[time=265] We were on a trip yesterday to Indianapolis and talking about it.
[time=268] Don, one of the maintenance men on our staff, told me Thursday night you'll want to be in church Sunday.
[time=273] Rick, it's going to be good.
[time=275] Are you preaching today Don?
[time=278] But this is a song that so powerfully speaks of the very purpose of our life, the praise God.
[time=284] We get so caught up in our task-oriented society and our production-minded world
[time=290] that we forget the very purpose of our life is the praise God and the shout forth with praise.
[time=296] I am so thankful to be privileged to be a part of this church where God has enabled us to do exactly that, to shout forth his praises.
[time=304] And so today as we worship, the joys are of listening to a choir lead us musically
[time=310] in singing "Shout forth with praise."
[time=326] Come and see the words of God.
[time=332] Awesome to the sons of men, for the greatness of his power.
[time=339] Let us all rejoice in here.
[time=342] Be the rule by might forever.
[time=345] He keeps watch on all the land.
[time=348] Rest the Lord with all your being.
[time=352] Raise your voices, flap your hands.
[time=358] Shout, joinfully to God.
[time=362] Sing the glory of his name.
[time=365] Shout his praises evermore.
[time=368] He alone will never change.
[time=372] Sing the glory.
[time=378] Sing the glory of his name.
[time=384] Come and hear what God has done.
[time=391] Gealing mighty mind and song through the working of his power.
[time=398] Making us completely home.
[time=401] Certainly he hears us pray.
[time=404] The Lord Jesus, bring me come.
[time=408] All the earth will worship you.
[time=411] Sing a praise Almighty one.
[time=417] Shout, joinfully to God.
[time=421] Sing the glory of his name.
[time=424] Shout his praises evermore.
[time=427] He alone will never change.
[time=431] Sing the glory.
[time=437] Sing the glory of his name.
[time=444] Shout, joinfully to God.
[time=447] Sing the glory of his name.
[time=451] Shout his praises evermore.
[time=454] He alone will never change.
[time=457] Sing the glory.
[time=464] Sing the glory of his name.
[time=470] Shout, joinfully to God.
[time=474] Sing the glory of his name.
[time=477] Shout his praises evermore.
[time=480] He alone will never change.
[time=484] Sing the glory.
[time=490] Sing the glory of his.
[time=511] [APPLAUSE]
[time=516] It's kind of nice when I just allow the choir to say, okay, now forget the notes.
[time=523] I don't say that very often.
[time=525] We work hard to try to get the notes, but on that particular song, just kind of forget the notes and just shout joyfully to God.
[time=531] There's joy in serving our Lord Jesus.
[time=534] That's the theme of our next song, Him number 615.
[time=537] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanza enthusiastically, knowing and showing that we love the Lord and love to serve Him 615.
[time=547] [MUSIC]
[time=556] There is joy in serving Jesus as a journey of our way,
[time=565] so that it fills our heart in praises, every hour and every day.
[time=575] There is joy, joy, thanks are in Jesus, joy that crops within my heart, every home and every hour.
[time=589] As I crawl upon His throne, there is joy and joy that never shall be heard.
[time=604] There is joy in serving Jesus.
[time=609] There is joy in serving Jesus, joy that crops within my heart, every home and every hour.
[time=619] There is joy in serving Jesus, joy that crops within my heart,
[time=634] every home and every hour.
[time=639] As I crawl upon His throne, there is joy, joy that never shall be heard.
[time=654] There is joy in serving Jesus, joy that crops within my heart,
[time=669] every home and every hour.
[time=676] There is joy, joy in serving Jesus, joy that crops within my heart,
[time=686] every home and every hour.
[time=690] As I crawl upon His throne, there is joy, joy that never shall be heard.
[time=698] Never shall be heard.
[time=711] Today we have the privilege of not only singing of our joy for the Lord Jesus Christ, but assembling together with hundreds and hundreds of other believers to do that very thing.
[time=723] There is a power that comes to our lives when we unite with others.
[time=729] The book of Ecclesiastes said that a chord of two threads is strong, but a chord of three threads is not easily broken.
[time=737] That's simply an Old Testament way of saying there's strength when we come together.
[time=741] And I sense the strength of my life in being with you.
[time=745] And yet there is a unique privilege not only of being together, but once God has strengthened us to send believers out to build other churches,
[time=755] to do the work of missions and evangelism around the globe.
[time=759] And today it's our privilege to introduce to you Lori Sell, who is one of those sent out ones from our church.
[time=765] I'm going to ask Lori to come and join me.
[time=767] Lori has been a part of our career class for a number of years, and God has led her to go to Manila for the next three months to serve as a short-term missionary.
[time=777] Kathy and I were in Manila just six months ago, so our heart is very fond of the challenge that Lori has.
[time=783] I told her last week that I would just introduce her, and we would pray for her.
[time=788] And then in the first service I said, "Oh, tell them what you're doing." So I cheated.
[time=793] Will you allow me to do that again?
[time=795] She doesn't have any choice with 500 people looking at her.
[time=798] She has to say yes.
[time=800] Lori has been serving the Lord in our college class, in evangelism, in all studies, in mainstream ministry, in missions prayer group, and God has said of her, "Send her out." What a privilege it is to send her out.
[time=814] Lori, tell our church with whom you're going and what you'll do.
[time=817] Well, I'll be going with an inter-denominational Christian organization called Youth with a Mission.
[time=824] And we're going to be celebrating God's grace over there also.
[time=828] Our church has been focusing on God's grace these last few weeks, and I'm just excited about the joy that we'll be celebrating over there.
[time=838] And right now the Filipino people are just real open to hearing God's message
[time=844] that He loves them and that they need to accept them, except Him as their Savior and their Lord.
[time=852] And I just would have you pray for the Filipino people that they understand God's love and the need for Him in their lives.
[time=859] And that is only through Christ that they can have that right relationship with Him.
[time=864] I'm excited about what God has in store.
[time=867] Well, Lori, in three months you'll be able to have a tremendous impact, and we want to pray for you as your home church and sending church that God would use this time, not just in your life, but give you a great opportunity to serve Him.
[time=879] Would you join me as we pray for Lori?
[time=882] God, our hearts are thankful that you have raised up from our church, men and women, who would take the work of spreading the gospel to Japan like Mary,
[time=893] or to Germany like Denny and Debbie, or to Africa like Doug and Tammy, and now Lori to go as a short term missionary to Manila.
[time=902] God, we're thankful for the fact that your hand is upon this church and sending forth missionaries, and we would pray today for Lori that you would give her great opportunities to not only use her medical talent and her education, but to give her opportunities to share the Lord Jesus Christ with men and women.
[time=922] You've said that the world is white on the harvest, and we know that the Philippines are open, and we pray that you would use her and bless her in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=934] Thank you, Lori.
[time=935] We have, at this point in the last five years, seen 15 people who have at one point been a part of our church go to the mission field.
[time=943] Now, Lori goes for a short term, but that's not only a responsibility to send people around the world.
[time=949] We need to be sent out ones ourselves.
[time=951] Those of us who work at Magnavox, or at Dana, are in an office building downtown, or who manage a home, we need to be sent out into this community and be ambassadors for Christ.
[time=962] It's a joy today to know that Lori's going, but just as much a joy to know that you and I are sent out into our communities for Christ.
[time=971] We're celebrating God's grace.
[time=973] So many of you have already helped.
[time=975] We've had hundreds of people involved in the home visitations, in publicity, and working as hostess, captains, a variety of things that have happened this morning.
[time=985] Could I just ask those who have already, there'll be an opportunity for everybody in the future, but those of you who have already had an assignment have helped out in some way with celebrating God's grace.
[time=995] Would you just stand right now so we can see how many of our people have been involved?
[time=999] Don't be shy. Just stand up right now.
[time=1001] Thanks, George, for starting us off.
[time=1003] Isn't that great? God's using us to build a new church.
[time=1007] Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1009] Tonight we'll have some more meetings, but we are thankful for your labor for each one of you.
[time=1014] If you haven't had a chance to serve, we'll give you one in just a few days.
[time=1018] This morning, Dave and Debbie Johnson come to remind us of the fact that Jesus loves us.
[time=1023] They use their talents on string instruments to say, "Jesus, lover of my soul."
[time=1056] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=1192] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1197] Pete, this has been a very busy weekend for you and the whole music department.
[time=1201] Yes, Rick, this is the time of the year when the choir gets together in preparation for the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=1206] We rehearsed this last weekend on Friday evening and all day Saturday.
[time=1211] Well, along with that special emphasis on the choir retreat weekend, you've got another musical coming up in just a few weeks.
[time=1219] Yes, we have to kind of temporarily table the Living Christmas Tree music, and we are preparing for a worship and celebration service that's going to be held here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church on Saturday, November 8.
[time=1231] Rick, we're combining with the Sunnycrest Baptist Church from Marion, Indiana, the Emmanuel Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne, and the Bible Baptist Church from Auburn, as well as our choir, singing a great number of worshipful songs in an evening of celebration to the Lord.
[time=1246] Well, that sounds like it's going to be a huge choir for that night.
[time=1249] We anticipate at least 200, and there'll be a live orchestra with us, and hopefully a large congregation that'll be singing some of the same songs with the choir and orchestra, and it'll be a great night of music.
[time=1261] Well, I'm looking forward to that, and if you can join us at 7 o'clock on November 8, this is one concert that you will not have to have tickets for, so don't worry about writing in or calling.
[time=1272] Just feel free to come on November 8 at 7 o'clock.
[time=1275] All right, that's absolutely right.
[time=1277] We have been talking about the Living Christmas Tree also, and the concerts for those are still quite a distance into the future, but Pete, I hate to inform you, people were calling long distance yesterday from as far away as Missouri, wanting tickets.
[time=1291] Well, this is always encouraging to us that people do write in early, and we do need to announce that the public distribution of tickets is Saturday, November 15.
[time=1301] That's a very important day, and you can come to the Blackhawk Baptist Church here at 7321 East State Boulevard and receive tickets at that time.
[time=1310] Well, I know many of our friends who watch by way of television make an extra effort to come to the Living Christmas Tree, and we do so much enjoy meeting you.
[time=1319] As a matter of fact, yesterday, I was visiting a friend in the Indianapolis Hospital and walking out.
[time=1325] I met a Bible or viewer as far away as Indianapolis.
[time=1328] Again, that's encouraging to us.
[time=1330] It seems like when we're around, particularly in the Fort Wayne area, that people do stop and say that they watch the Bible hour.
[time=1337] To those friends of you who support us financially, we want to thank you and let you know how much we not only appreciate your support, but how far-reaching it is.
[time=1346] There's hardly a time that Peter I are in a hospital or even a shopping mall that somebody doesn't tell us of the impact of the Bible hour in their life.
[time=1354] And that was true yesterday in Indianapolis, where a family was there from Marion, and we were just able to have a word of encouragement there together, because you made our paths possible to cross through television.
[time=1367] Before we go back to the live part of our Morning Worship service, we want to ask you once again to write in for a helpful booklet entitled "Timeless Insights."
[time=1376] Many of you who watch regularly have probably heard us talk about this often.
[time=1380] We won't be sharing timeless insights with you for several more weeks.
[time=1383] This will be the last for some time.
[time=1386] So if you've been thinking about it, the time to act is now.
[time=1390] Timeless Insights is a helpful little booklet that will direct you through a personal Bible study of God's Word.
[time=1396] The Bible says that faith comes by hearing and hearing by God's Word.
[time=1401] Today in our study, when we open up our Bibles to Acts chapter 2 in the little bit, we'll discover that the early church grew because it says they continued steadfast in the teaching of the apostles.
[time=1414] Wouldn't that be an excellent description for our lives today that we continued steadfast in the teaching of what God wrote in this book?
[time=1423] How do you do that?
[time=1424] How do you gain insight from it?
[time=1426] Well, this booklet "Timeless Insights" is a helpful tool to guide you through reading the New Testament in one year,
[time=1432] and we'd love to send you a copy for simply writing and asking for it.
[time=1437] To get your copy of "Timeless Insights" right to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1446] Thank you again for joining us today for the Bible hour, and as we go back to our morning worship service, we're going to hear from Dave and Debbie Johnson again, and then studying on the book of Acts, why should we build a new church?
[time=1461] Well, we are in a building program here at Blackhawk, but it's not just a building program of building buildings.
[time=1468] It's not just a building program of building brick walls and roofs and cement and floors.
[time=1474] It's a program of building lives through God's Word.
[time=1477] I hope you'll stay and be a part of the rest of today's broadcast.
[time=1498] [MUSIC - 100 seconds]
[time=1608] ♪ Thank you, Dave and Debbie, and God, we thank you for a song that reminds us that I am his and that he is mine,
[time=1626] that calm assurance that we do indeed belong to the Lord Jesus.
[time=1631] Father, today through this hour, we would pray that you would strengthen the faith of each believer in Christ,
[time=1637] that they might have that abiding peace, that inner voice that says yes, I have been forgiven.
[time=1645] I have been included in God's family.
[time=1648] Father, today through your Word, we pray that you would stimulate us to walk in obedience, that we might know even by the walk of our life, the assurance of our salvation.
[time=1658] And Father, we would pray today that you would encourage and comfort the hearts of many today who are discouraged.
[time=1666] We pray for those who fight for health.
[time=1669] We're thankful for Lois Clancy's progress that her body is no longer rejecting the kidney.
[time=1675] We pray that her white corpuscle count might allow for the continued treatments in therapy.
[time=1682] We would pray for Jane Faye Broger and her senior years that as you give to her days that you might give to her strength in life and health.
[time=1691] We would pray for Don Maley that your good and perfect will would be worked out in his life,
[time=1697] that your watch care would protect his family and friends.
[time=1702] Father, we would ask today that your spirit would work in the hearts of men and women who have out of bitterness
[time=1709] fractured their relationship with each other or their children or their parents or their neighbor or this church.
[time=1718] God, that you would be a source of healing for damaged emotions.
[time=1722] We would pray today for Ron Hackett that you might give recovery to his back and strengthen him that he might be able to work,
[time=1730] that he might be able to continue in his service to you.
[time=1733] Father, we would pray today for Ileana Lots as she faces yet another surgery.
[time=1738] Your hand would guide her doctors and give wisdom to their mind.
[time=1742] We would pray for Chris Dick that his recovers from this surgery that he would not only grow strong physically,
[time=1748] but he might spiritually sense your love.
[time=1751] Father, today, you know the needs of those who are here, the needs of my own life.
[time=1757] We would pray that as we worship you, we would find not only a declaration of your grace,
[time=1763] but a personal experience of your goodness.
[time=1766] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1769] [AMEN] As most of you know, Kathy and I had the privilege of being on the mission field this past year.
[time=1778] Some of her stories of the things that we ate remind you of the difference of culture.
[time=1784] But of all the things that we learned, probably this one thing stuck in my mind from that mission's trip.
[time=1791] One of the countries which we visited was a country where less than 1% of that entire population
[time=1801] attend a Bible teaching church.
[time=1805] Less than 1% of the people of Japan attend a church where the Bible is taught in Jesus Christ is declared as Lord.
[time=1814] 99% of that whole country don't hear that message.
[time=1821] Just a few months after we returned from that mission's trip, we found ourselves on another mission's trip.
[time=1826] Though we didn't know it was going to be turned into a mission's trip, it indeed became one.
[time=1832] During the month of June, we were speaking in another church with very, very similar statistics.
[time=1839] This church was located not in Japan, but in a different community.
[time=1843] And in this community, only 2% of this entire community attended a Bible teaching church.
[time=1853] Much to your surprise, this community was not located in Asia or in Africa or in South America.
[time=1861] It was the city of Boca Raton, Florida.
[time=1864] And the Tri-County area from Miami to West Palm Beach was targeted by a Billy Graham research team.
[time=1872] And as they explored the possibility of having a crusade there, they discovered in Southeast Florida,
[time=1879] less than 2% of the people attend a Bible teaching church.
[time=1885] As Francis Shafer put it, we are truly living in a post-Christian era.
[time=1891] There has to be to this church and to every church a too-pronged attack in evangelism.
[time=1897] There has to be a commitment to evangelism here and ascending of missionaries there.
[time=1904] We've got to send Lori Sells and Mary Crews and Mike and Carolyn Ballis overseas.
[time=1912] But we have got to be as committed to evangelism here as we are there.
[time=1919] Because at the present rate of church growth, there will not be missionaries to send from here.
[time=1925] As alarming as this may seem, it is projected by the year 2000 by mission strategists
[time=1931] that North America will no longer be the sending agency for missionaries.
[time=1937] That Africa will lead the world's continents in sending out missionaries.
[time=1943] Today, Lori told me of a lady she met.
[time=1946] A lady who was French, who was sent out from France as a missionary to these United States of America.
[time=1956] We've got to be committed to evangelism and missions as a too-pronged strategy for the future.
[time=1964] As we face celebrating God's grace and an endeavor to build a new building, why on earth should we build one more building?
[time=1973] What purpose would that have?
[time=1975] Some said, do we need to build a new building because we can no longer meet in a gym?
[time=1980] Not at all. This gym is great.
[time=1983] You know, there are people who don't even know that this is a gym until we tell them.
[time=1987] They go, oh, yeah, this is a gym and they look up and they see baskets.
[time=1991] One year during the living Christmas tree, a gentleman came up to me and said, I've never been here before, but I watch the Bible every week.
[time=1998] Where's your other auditorium?
[time=2000] He said, this is it, friend.
[time=2002] He said, this is it, this is it.
[time=2005] And, you know, we could serve the Lord Jesus Christ here forever.
[time=2008] There isn't anything wrong with meeting in a gym.
[time=2011] There's only one thing wrong with this gym.
[time=2014] It's not big enough to give us enough opportunity to reach more people for Christ.
[time=2019] You see, we're not building a new auditorium and a larger auditorium so that you and I can have seats.
[time=2026] We've got our seats.
[time=2028] At least I've got mine. Anybody want one?
[time=2030] We've got three right here today.
[time=2032] We're building that auditorium that we might be able to reach more people for Christ.
[time=2037] I'd like to steal a comment of Bill Bodek, or as one of the men of our church, without his permission.
[time=2043] So Bill, if I'm stealing your quote, you didn't want me to forgive me.
[time=2048] We were in a meeting in the chapel about a month ago.
[time=2051] Bill just shared spontaneously a word of testimony.
[time=2055] He stood up in the chapel and he said, when my wife and I came to this church, somebody before us had the vision in the faith to build this auditorium that we call the chapel.
[time=2066] Because they did that, there was room for me and my family.
[time=2070] Bill said, now it's my turn to help build a new building so there's room for somebody else.
[time=2077] Our church has a great opportunity to serve the Lord Jesus Christ and to reach out by winning men and women to Christ.
[time=2085] We need new facilities to do that.
[time=2088] Why should we build a church?
[time=2090] I believe for this reason.
[time=2092] So that this church can be all that God intends for it to be.
[time=2097] So it was important to me to look back at the early church and to say, what was that early church and how did they function?
[time=2105] Turn in your Bible if you will today, please, to Acts chapter 2 and verse 36.
[time=2110] Acts 2 verse 36 and through verse 42 will be our study today and tonight.
[time=2118] We're going to cover a lot of concepts, so we'll spill this over into our evening service tonight and I'm sure that you'll want to be here tonight in spite of the fact that there's a little league baseball game.
[time=2132] Acts 2 verse 36.
[time=2135] This is the end of Peter's message on the day of Pentecost.
[time=2139] I'm just picking up his last statement and then discovering the reaction of people.
[time=2144] Acts 2 verse 36.
[time=2147] "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye crucified both Lord and Christ."
[time=2161] Now, when they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts.
[time=2167] And said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do?
[time=2177] Then Peter said unto them, repent and be baptized.
[time=2184] Every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2196] For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
[time=2207] And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying save yourselves from this crooked generation.
[time=2218] Then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls.
[time=2231] And they continued steadfast in the apostles doctrine and in fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers.
[time=2243] The early church, how did they function? I believe that that is a study worth our time because we want to follow the principles of God's Word.
[time=2253] Someone's going to say, gotcha. I already read ahead of you, reckon way down in verse 46 it says, and they met continually daily with one accord in the temple.
[time=2264] The early church didn't build any buildings, therefore we should not build any buildings. Early church didn't do that.
[time=2270] You know what? You're absolutely right. But can I give you first of all a principle and then a history lesson?
[time=2276] Principle is this. As we're studying how the early church function, we need to be careful that we're lifting out of that and distinguishing between principles and experiences.
[time=2290] Just because they did do something or they didn't do something doesn't make it a principle that we should follow.
[time=2298] You see, the early church met in tombs. In the city of Rome there were these underground catacombs where they buried dead people.
[time=2306] And that's where the church met. And yet of all the people I hear say, the church should not build buildings, no one says.
[time=2313] And we had to go out to the cemetery, pry open the mausoleums and get in there and pray.
[time=2320] Well that's what the early church did. Shouldn't we do that? You see we're confusing simply what was an experience with what was a principle.
[time=2328] I heard a tape of a man put this together hilariously this past week.
[time=2332] He was talking about just because something happened in the Bible doesn't mean that God meant us to do it that way every time.
[time=2338] He said one time and only once Jesus healed a man through this process.
[time=2343] He spit on the ground, formed some mud out of the spit, put it on a man's eyes and pronounced him healed.
[time=2352] Now if we say that experience as principles then probably the most biblical people in America are amongst the national baseball league.
[time=2362] Because they spit more than anybody else I know.
[time=2366] The speaker went on to say someone will get a hold of this passage and start the first church of the holy saliva.
[time=2372] That's the way Jesus did it.
[time=2375] Now let's talk. What are we really trying to say here?
[time=2380] Yeah they didn't build buildings. Now the history lesson. You know why they didn't build buildings?
[time=2385] Phase one they had the temple. They walked into an existing building and used it and they were welcome to use it until Acts chapter 4.
[time=2394] Acts chapter 4 they said you can't come in here, you can't use our building, you can't mention the name of Jesus and they drove them out.
[time=2404] And right after that Rome called Christianity in Latin religio illicata.
[time=2413] That simply means this. Rome declared Christianity an illegal religion.
[time=2420] And you weren't allowed to be a Christian. You weren't allowed to buy property and build buildings and put the first church of Rome.
[time=2427] It was illegal. That's why they didn't build buildings. That's why they went to the catacombs. It was the only safe place in town.
[time=2436] But in 313 AD Constantine was emperor of the Roman Empire and went through a conversion experience of his own.
[time=2446] And in 313 he issued what was called the edict of Milan that made Christianity no longer religio illicata but religio lissata, a legal religion.
[time=2458] And instantly the church came out of the tombs. They didn't like it down there.
[time=2463] And they went above ground and the gospel was spread and immediately they began to build facilities.
[time=2470] Now I'm not here today really to emphasize building buildings but I do want us to understand a little history.
[time=2477] I took four years of history and two more classes in graduate school and somewhere along the way you have to teach all this stuff.
[time=2484] So I'm sneaking it in on you.
[time=2486] But we just need to understand that they didn't build buildings. Why? They had buildings available and when the building was unavailable they were not allowed to be there.
[time=2495] That's why they didn't build them.
[time=2497] We need to build buildings today only to allow the gospel to spread.
[time=2502] If the building is built as simply a monument, a man or so we can simply say look what we have then we shouldn't build the building.
[time=2510] But if a building allows us to increase the effectiveness of the ministry what greater investment could we make?
[time=2517] Now in this early church we want to look at them and answer these two questions, at least I do.
[time=2523] What is the church and what did they do in the church?
[time=2528] Well in this early church the church was not a building and we should never confuse the Black Hawk Baptist Church with the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2536] They're not the same thing. You see the Black Hawk Baptist Church are those people who are born again into the family of God.
[time=2545] And you should never confuse that with the Black Hawk Baptist Church which is a concrete cement building on the corner of state and lay mire.
[time=2553] Because the church isn't on the corner of state and lay mire, the church is wherever we who are committed to Christ go.
[time=2561] And in this concrete building there are many people here today who are not part of the church.
[time=2568] The church are those who are described here in three ways and that's the heart of what we're going to study today.
[time=2575] What was this early church? It was nothing more of than people who had these three things as a part of their life.
[time=2586] First of all, to use a good old-fashioned word, they were people who were saved.
[time=2594] Look down at the text we've read at verse 40, right in the middle of our study Peter said, with many other words, did he testify and exhort them saying,
[time=2605] "Save yourselves from this perverse, our crooked generation."
[time=2612] Now I'm going to make a confession. Before I ever gave my heart to Christ there were emotional religious words that made me grit my teeth every time I heard them, saved.
[time=2624] Does that word say something to you that conjures up images of religion that you don't want to have?
[time=2633] When I hear that word saved I remember going to a meeting as an unbeliever in Christ with a good friend of mine.
[time=2640] And at the end of this meeting they sang just as I am at least a dozen times.
[time=2647] And no matter how it worked they sang one more verse.
[time=2651] If nobody comes we'll sing one more verse until somebody comes.
[time=2655] If somebody came they sang, "Since somebody came we better sing one more verse." And my friend and I often talked about maybe we should go forward so they'll let us go home.
[time=2666] And you know we get bad images of good words.
[time=2670] And if I want to accomplish anything today for those of you who don't know what this word means is to take a good word and restore it to a good image for you.
[time=2681] Because it speaks so clearly of what God wants to do to you and to me.
[time=2687] That is he wants to save us. He wants to rescue us.
[time=2693] How can an individual be saved? What does this word mean?
[time=2697] Out of the text we've studied today can I tell you four things that you must do to be saved.
[time=2703] The first thing you must do is found in the first verse we read verse 36.
[time=2709] You must recognize that Jesus Christ is both Lord and Christ.
[time=2716] That's the whole bottom line of the message that we declare to you today.
[time=2722] That Jesus is Lord.
[time=2726] That he was not just a good man.
[time=2729] A good man with some miraculous powers and a good man with a great message.
[time=2734] That he was actually God come to earth and that he was Lord.
[time=2738] And that he was the Christ the appointed God man to take away the sins of the world.
[time=2745] You see today for you to be a Christian.
[time=2748] It's not a matter that you were born into a family that attends church or that you're a part of a culture.
[time=2754] To be a Christian is not a matter of heritage.
[time=2757] It's a matter of recognition that Jesus Christ is God and that he is Lord.
[time=2766] Men and women throughout the centuries have investigated.
[time=2769] They've attacked that principle and the testimony of history stands that the evidence is in
[time=2775] and that Jesus Christ died for our sins and he bodily arose from the grave to prove that he was Lord.
[time=2784] If you would be saved today you have to recognize that he is Lord.
[time=2790] The second thing you have to do to be saved today is to recognize that you are in danger.
[time=2799] You see nobody is going to be saved who doesn't recognize that they're in danger.
[time=2805] When Peter was walking on the water he was so amazed that he was walking on the water that he began to panic.
[time=2812] His faith doubted and he began to sink and he prayed the simplest prayer imaginable.
[time=2817] Lord save me.
[time=2821] Why did he say that? Because he recognized he was in danger.
[time=2827] Peter wanted that audience I want you today to recognize that you're in danger.
[time=2832] He said save yourselves from this crooked generation.
[time=2837] He was saying that Jesus Christ died because all of our generation is in danger of God's punishment and of hell because of the sins of our life
[time=2851] and that we desperately need to be rescued.
[time=2855] We need to be saved.
[time=2858] You must secondly recognize that you are a sinner separated from God.
[time=2864] Last week we talked about the temple with its various areas and there was an outer court that was separated by that huge middle wall of partition.
[time=2873] That middle wall in the temple has been destroyed but there is still a middle wall standing today.
[time=2878] It is a wall that separates us from God.
[time=2881] It is a wall made brick by brick with each of the sins of our lives.
[time=2888] And only Christ can break that wall down and we're on the opposite side from God in danger of judgment.
[time=2897] You must recognize that Christ is Lord.
[time=2900] You must recognize that you're a sinner in need of a Savior.
[time=2904] Thirdly you must repent.
[time=2906] Now there's another one of those old words that may conjure up wrong images for you.
[time=2910] Many times people think when they hear the word repent that that means great weeping and gnashing and expression of emotion.
[time=2917] That may or may not be a part of repentance.
[time=2921] The actual word repent is a compound of two words to change your mind.
[time=2927] When a person repents they look at their life and they say I've always said that this is okay.
[time=2933] It's my life. I can do this.
[time=2935] And now I recognize from God's perspective that all of these things are wrong in their sin and I change my mind.
[time=2945] You see you've got to change your mind.
[time=2947] You said it's your life and you can do with it what you want.
[time=2951] Now you're changing your mind saying my life belongs to God.
[time=2954] I must surrender to him.
[time=2956] You said Jesus is some obscure figure of history whom I can ignore.
[time=2960] You change your mind and say he is both Lord and Christ.
[time=2964] You said I can do all of these things because it's my life.
[time=2968] You say I can no longer do these things they're wrong.
[time=2971] It is a changing of the mind.
[time=2973] When your mind changes maybe you'll show emotion maybe you won't.
[time=2977] But repentance is that changing of mind.
[time=2981] And the final thing you must do is receive.
[time=2985] Verse 38 says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus
[time=2993] for the remissions of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3001] We've studied recently spiritual gifts.
[time=3004] This is not talking about spiritual gifts that Bob may have the gift of teaching and Jim the gift of exhortation and Steve the gift of helps and Amy the gift of hospitality.
[time=3014] This is talking about the initial gift of salvation.
[time=3019] What must you do to be saved today?
[time=3021] Recognize Christ as Lord.
[time=3024] Recognize your own sinfulness and repent and receive Christ as your Savior.
[time=3030] That's who the early church was.
[time=3032] It was first of all people who had been saved.
[time=3034] Can I ask you point blank?
[time=3036] Have you truly been saved?
[time=3039] I didn't ask you how long you've come to this church.
[time=3042] I've asked you have you been saved?
[time=3045] It doesn't matter whether you've been a part of our Sunday school.
[time=3049] Have you been saved?
[time=3051] Have you received Christ as your Savior?
[time=3054] That's what the early church was.
[time=3056] It was people who were saved.
[time=3058] Secondly, it was not only people who were saved, but people who identified with Christ.
[time=3065] This comes up twice.
[time=3067] Verse 38 says, "And they ask what shall we do?"
[time=3074] And Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized."
[time=3080] And in verse 41 it says, "And they that gladly received his word were baptized."
[time=3088] This can be a very confusing issue.
[time=3091] Is this passage saying that you've got to repent and be baptized in order to be saved?
[time=3097] And if you don't repent and if you're not baptized, you're not going to be saved?
[time=3101] That's not what this passage is teaching.
[time=3105] Baptism is very, very important and we're going to emphasize that.
[time=3109] But you don't have to be baptized to be saved.
[time=3112] This verse is saying, "Repent and after you have repented, give testimony of that.
[time=3121] Give reference to that by being baptized." Elsewhere in the Bible it tells us how we can be saved in many, many places without being baptized.
[time=3132] For example, the very next time Peter preaches in Acts chapter 3 and verse 19 he says,
[time=3139] "Repent therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out." He didn't include baptism.
[time=3146] For those of you from a mathematical background, you may remember a little formula called the greatest common factor.
[time=3154] The greatest common factor says if I take the numbers 3, 15, 30, 60, what are the greatest common factors?
[time=3166] 3.
[time=3167] That's the one number that can be divided into all those evenly.
[time=3171] In some verses the Bible God will say, "Believe and be baptized follows that."
[time=3177] Another place it may say, "Believe and it won't mention baptized." And another place it may say, "Believe and be converted." But the common element is that believing Christ and repenting from calling Him a man to calling Him God.
[time=3196] Unless it rained on the day of the crucifixion, the thief on the cross was not baptized.
[time=3202] You don't have to be baptized to be saved.
[time=3205] But the point of this passage is not to minimize baptism, but to maximize it.
[time=3211] And in that Jewish community, there were many who believed, but never publicly identified themselves with Christ.
[time=3219] In John chapter 12 it said, "Many of the religious leaders of His day, the Pharisees, believed, but they would not testify of their belief in Him because they loved the praises of men more than the praises of God."
[time=3233] And so there was a sharp line in the church between those who believed and identified with Christ and those who had not made that identification.
[time=3243] And you were never included in the church until you were baptized.
[time=3248] And to be baptized in that day was a public identification with Christ.
[time=3255] And it says in verse 41, "They that received His word gladly, the natural response of that was to identify with Christ in baptism."
[time=3265] Allow me to make two practical points here.
[time=3268] First of all, baptism is important today.
[time=3271] Can you go to heaven without being baptized? You most certainly can.
[time=3275] Should you be baptized? If you're a believer in Christ, you certainly should.
[time=3280] Second application is this. It's not only a matter of identifying with Christ in a church building by being immersed underwater.
[time=3291] Baptism was a statement to a watching world of uncompromising commitment to Christ.
[time=3299] You see, in those days when a Jewish young man would give his heart to Christ, his family would raise concerns, but they would still accept him.
[time=3308] But if that son was to be baptized, they would literally excommunicate him from the family, and they would have a funeral service and count him as dead.
[time=3320] And from that day on, when someone would say, "How is your son?" The Jewish father would say, "I have no son."
[time=3329] That was identifying with Christ.
[time=3332] And we today need not only to be baptized, but we need to do more than that.
[time=3337] We need to identify with Christ before this community in every way that we can.
[time=3342] Jesus said, "Whosoever would confess me before men, him will I confess before my father is in heaven."
[time=3349] And whosoever will deny me before men, him will I deny before my father who is in heaven.
[time=3356] That was what the early church was.
[time=3358] It was made up of men and women who were first saved and secondly, publicly identified with Christ.
[time=3366] I've said it before, allow me to say it again, "God has no secret agents."
[time=3374] A couple of years ago, I met a friend from high school.
[time=3378] When I met him, he was now working for a church as a youth pastor.
[time=3383] And I said, "Phil, when did you come to know Christ?" He said, "Oh, I came to know Christ in junior high school." And I wanted to grab him and say, "Where were you in high school? You wimp?" He never let anybody know he was a Christian in high school.
[time=3398] He didn't have the courage to take a stand for Christ.
[time=3402] These men and women were men and women of courage who said, "I'll not be ashamed of the Christ who died for me."
[time=3410] That's what this church is to be.
[time=3412] It's to be men and women who have received Christ as Savior and who are not ashamed.
[time=3417] Yes, we're winsome.
[time=3418] Yes, we're graciousness.
[time=3419] But like Paul, we pray that we might have boldness to speak in his name.
[time=3425] And finally, they were not only those who believed and were baptized, they were those who made a commitment to that local fellowship.
[time=3433] It says they were added unto the church.
[time=3436] I don't know that the early church had membership in the sense that we had membership today, but I can tell you these four things were true about church membership.
[time=3444] One, there was recognition on the part of the individual that they belonged to that church.
[time=3449] Secondly, there was recognition on the part of that church that that individual belonged to them.
[time=3455] Thirdly, there was a sense of responsibility that that individual had to that church.
[time=3461] And formally, there was a formal recognition that that church had responsibility to that individual.
[time=3468] The Bible says we're to do good unto all men, but especially those who are of the household of faith.
[time=3473] In 1 Timothy chapter 5, it says that there was to be a list kept.
[time=3479] And this list was to identify those who were widows who had identified with the church.
[time=3485] In 1 Corinthians chapter 5, there was obviously an official awareness of who was a member and who was not,
[time=3492] because one man was told because of a sin, he was to be put out.
[time=3496] I believe this church needs to be three things, people who are saved and preach that message.
[time=3502] People who are baptized and not ashamed to profess Christ in the marketplace.
[time=3507] And people who have said, "Yes, I'll make a commitment to that church." We've been sharing with you the ministry and music from Dave and Debbie Johnson and the ministry from God's Word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3521] Perhaps you're a new viewer today or you've been watching for several weeks, and today is the day that you would make a decision concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3530] If that's true in your life, will you take a moment and pray with me, let's pray together.
[time=3535] Our Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3542] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3546] I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of my sins.
[time=3550] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3554] If you've made a decision today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
