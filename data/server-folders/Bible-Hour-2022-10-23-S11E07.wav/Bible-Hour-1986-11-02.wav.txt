[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] When I was a student at a Christian University, I sat in the back of the chapels with a number of friends doing several things that we shouldn't have been doing.
[time=118] One of those was rewriting popular Christian hymns, such as Amazing Grace, "How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like you, or I was sinking deep in sin, won't you come and push me in, or this one? Take my life and let it be."
[time=136] Yeah, Lord, just let it be. It's my life. I wonder today how many of us are saying that to God. My life. Let it be.
[time=152] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour. We're glad you've joined us. Today, Rick's message is taken from Matthew chapter 21, and is entitled, "Correct Assumption About Ownership."
[time=172] Paul says, "You are not your own. You were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God of your body and spirit. Perhaps you have said, "It's my life. Let it be."
[time=184] We invite you to study with us today and to discover that your life is not your own. It actually belongs to God.
[time=192] Please locate your Bible and have it open to Matthew chapter 21 so that you are able to study with us. We will be looking at verses 33 through 40.
[time=202] Today's special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir. We'll also be hearing from Crystal Hall and Scott Schindler.
[time=216] The Bible Hour is an extension ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=228] We pray that the Lord will use this worship service to minister to you. Now here's Rick.
[time=238] [MUSIC]
[time=248] Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=250] The Apostle Paul said...
[time=258] The Apostle Paul said that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=268] Today, as we meet this as our morning worship service, we've come today to glorify God by praising the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=278] Thank you for worshiping with us today. For those friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour, thank you for the privilege of coming into your home.
[time=286] Or perhaps your hospital room with the message that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=292] Our choir leads us this morning with that praise note that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=300] Thank you for joining with us. And with your heart today, may you be a part of this worshiping song.
[time=308] [MUSIC]
[time=332] Jesus, though He was God, did not cling to His right as God, but laid aside His mighty power, His mighty power and glory.
[time=358] [MUSIC - 172 seconds]
[time=546] It's great to proclaim that truth.
[time=548] In spite of the fact of what we see in this world today and some of the commercials and just things that are done secularly,
[time=554] you do realize that sometimes it's not really equitable that it appears that God is honoring those that are not honoring Him in this world as much as He's honoring the Christians and that could indeed be true.
[time=566] But we look forward to the day when every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=574] It is so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take Him at His word. Him number 534 will sing the first, second, and third stanzas together, 534.
[time=588] It is so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take Him at His word, just to finish the promise, just to roll the step for more.
[time=614] [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=718] It's my privilege this morning in our morning service to give you
[time=726] somewhat of an update of our celebrating God's grace campaign.
[time=732] Many times we have congregational business meetings.
[time=734] They're almost always after an evening service.
[time=738] And if you miss that meeting occasionally you miss some of the information.
[time=742] I learned this past week for people to understand something they have to hear it seven times.
[time=748] The first time we hear something we don't even hear it.
[time=750] The second time we hear it we hear it but we don't think about it.
[time=754] The third time we hear it we hear it and we don't like it.
[time=756] The fourth time we hear it we say that won't work anywhere.
[time=760] Next time we hear it we hear it and we say well that will work somewhere but not here.
[time=764] The sixth time we hear it we say well maybe that will work here and the seventh time we hear it we say.
[time=770] Isn't that the way we've always done it?
[time=772] So there's always a need to keep informing and informing and informing.
[time=776] So if you know all this you can say well I heard it from my sixth time.
[time=782] If it's your second time please do listen.
[time=784] Our church is going through a tremendous opportunity in these days of reaching out and drawing men and women to Christ.
[time=794] The last hour there were about seven people who came forward.
[time=796] Some from membership one for rededication a young man in his twenties to receive Christ as Savior.
[time=802] That is happening because of your outreach and because there's room.
[time=806] There has to be those two things.
[time=808] There has to be your outreach and there has to be room.
[time=812] Well if we keep reaching out for the Lord Jesus Christ we need additional space.
[time=816] This is our second of two hours and as you can see we're full to the overflow room and half of the choir was in the first hour
[time=822] and so half of those hundred people are going to be coming in in just a moment to gobble up every remaining seat.
[time=828] We need to grow.
[time=830] Well about 18 months ago we made a decision as a church to build a new sanctuary on the south side of State Street.
[time=838] People who weren't here often say well why are we going over there?
[time=842] It's quite easy.
[time=842] The size sanctuary we need to build won't realistically fit on the north side of State Street.
[time=848] Even if we did the future need for additional facilities would have to be on the south side of State Street.
[time=854] So it's not a matter if if we're going to build on the south side it's simply a matter of when.
[time=860] So our church voted and voted unanimously at that point to go across the street to South State.
[time=866] There our plans are to build a new sanctuary that seats about 1750 seats to 2,000 seats.
[time=874] Now in a sanctuary we're planning pews not chairs.
[time=878] So the number is not exact.
[time=880] Normal building codes say that you figure about 18 inches per person on the pew.
[time=886] So you can decide whether you need a half a seat, a full seat, a seat and a half.
[time=892] So I can't tell you exactly how many seats there'll be.
[time=896] It depends on how big you sit when you come.
[time=898] But it's designed to be about 1750 seats.
[time=902] Now to have a 1750 seat auditorium you need a large foyer.
[time=908] One of the greatest problems we have with two services is we can get 600 people in here the first hour
[time=914] and we can get 600 people here the second hour.
[time=916] It's getting them out and you win that is one of the major dilemmas.
[time=920] For an auditorium that size the foyer will need to be just about the size of this auditorium floor that you're in right now.
[time=928] And so it dawned on us very early that you don't want to build a space that big simply to get people into another space and to get them out.
[time=936] So we're designing that to be multiple purpose use.
[time=940] It can be the home for Super 60s, it can be midweek Bible studies, it can be an auditorium for a fellowship hall.
[time=946] That will be multiple use.
[time=948] Inside that sanctuary and foyer will be not only a choir loft but a choir room for the music department to rehearse and practice.
[time=956] During this next month they have a special concert coming up next Saturday night, 15 concerts at the Christmas time plus all the Sunday morning services.
[time=966] They need those rooms to train and to prepare in.
[time=968] There'll be a room that will be multiple use.
[time=970] It will be first of all a counseling room when people come forward as they do Sunday mornings.
[time=976] They'll be directed to that room where someone will meet with them and pray with them.
[time=980] But while it's not being used in that way it'll be multiple use.
[time=984] It will serve as a studio for our television ministry for the prerecorded parts of our broadcast.
[time=990] Inside that area that we're calling phase one will be enough nursery space to handle children from four years old and down.
[time=998] All of that will cost somewhere around three and a half million dollars for the land to be developed, the parking, the paving, the entrances, the exits, the buildings, the site work and all of that.
[time=1010] I remember as a young boy hearing Everett Dirksen say you take a few million dollars from this account and a few million dollars from that account and before long you're talking about real money.
[time=1020] Three and a half million dollars to build that sanctuary.
[time=1024] It's not going to be elegant but nor is it going to be a multiple use facility where everything is movable and damaged.
[time=1034] It will be a sanctuary that we will use for other purposes than Sunday morning but it will be for worship oriented events.
[time=1042] That building will try to design it to be simple and elegant. There will not be brass, gold or silver fixtures in the restrooms but hopefully there will be restrooms.
[time=1054] Now as a part of that we would love to build four to eight classrooms as a part of the initial building.
[time=1062] That way fewer people will need to cross from here to there.
[time=1064] But even if we can't build those classrooms there won't be a great deal of people who have to go back and forth.
[time=1070] Some will be here, some will be there and probably only a handful of classes that will need to go back and forth just like they do now between the middle school and our counseling center.
[time=1080] But if by God's grace we were able to raise the funds to build those classrooms that would be our desire to do that as a part of the initial construction.
[time=1090] That could be another 350 to 500 thousand dollars putting it a little over four million.
[time=1096] While we need to have a commitment out of our church of a million and a half dollars that's a bottom level threshold.
[time=1102] If we're able to see that commitment then we'll be able to build.
[time=1106] If we can exceed that commitment then that will be that much less money that we'll need to borrow and that many more classrooms we can build.
[time=1114] So we're asking you to in these days be praying about celebrating God's grace.
[time=1118] Crystal Hall is going to come now and sing for us out of the pages of Scripture again the 23rd Psalm.
[time=1124] The Lord is my shepherd. Crystal thank you for your ministry today.
[time=1144] The Lord is my shepherd. Crystal Hall is my shepherd. Crystal Hall is my shepherd.
[time=1158] He to the down in green pastures beside the still waters.
[time=1170] He restoreth my soul. Illideth in paths of righteousness for his namesake.
[time=1184] I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=1196] I will be no ill for that with me.
[time=1214] Thy rod and thy staff. They comfort me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[time=1232] I'll prepare a table before me. Before me the presence, the presence of my enemies.
[time=1252] Make a planet away. Make a planet away.
[time=1266] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
[time=1282] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord.
[time=1312] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible hour.
[time=1322] Pete how are you doing during these busy days? Rick we're doing fine.
[time=1326] We're anticipating the 14 concerts that will be coming up for the living Christmas tree in December.
[time=1330] And as of this taping we're just about a month away.
[time=1332] Well you're very busy not only with the living Christmas tree and the regular program but your family's about to move.
[time=1338] We'll be moving this week. If you have a paintbrush just come right over.
[time=1340] We'll be glad to have you come over and visit us.
[time=1342] I'll be glad to help you move but you don't want me to help you paint. It could ruin a good friendship.
[time=1348] Pete did mention that we're one month away from the living Christmas tree.
[time=1352] We've pre-recorded today's broadcast because of a preemption here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1356] So as you watch it we are beginning to distribute the living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=1362] On November the 15th is the time that we have begun to disperse the tickets and we don't know at this date how many are available and how many are gone.
[time=1370] But if you would like tickets to the living Christmas tree you can do one of two things.
[time=1374] You can stop by the Black Hawk Baptist Church and pick up your tickets in person.
[time=1378] Or you can call and have tickets reserved.
[time=1382] But if you do call us and have your tickets reserved then we'll only be able to hold those for you for a short period of time without redistributing those to others.
[time=1390] Pete could you give them the number to call?
[time=1392] Yes if you'd like to call and ask for information concerning living Christmas tree tickets just call 749-8524.
[time=1402] And Rick I might add that if they reserve the tickets that they need to pick them up before November 30th and in any other case we will redistribute them.
[time=1410] You know people often don't understand but we have a demand for living Christmas tree tickets probably about two to one.
[time=1418] Even though we have tickets for 15,000 people to come there are usually twice that many people who will request tickets and we just can't hold on to tickets and then have people not show up to get them.
[time=1428] So I hope they understand that.
[time=1430] Living Christmas tree is a major part of our outreach and we'd love to have you as a part of one of those public concerts.
[time=1436] And perhaps some of you would like to be a part of supporting Christian education, Black Hawk Christian School and be a part of our benefit concert.
[time=1444] If you would like information on the benefit concert simply call us here at the church office at 749-8524.
[time=1454] Pete a little bit about the theme of this year's living Christmas tree.
[time=1456] Well the title of the living Christmas tree performances is Everlasting Light and the main thrust will be the fact that Jesus Christ comes into our heart and becomes the light of the world through us and that as we let that light shine before men they'll understand that Jesus Christ is the true light
[time=1474] that can give blessing and peace not only in this season but throughout the year.
[time=1478] Well I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1480] Thank you for the hard work you and the choir have already put into it.
[time=1482] You're welcome.
[time=1484] Today we have a little pamphlet that I believe could be a major help to each of you.
[time=1488] As a pastor counselor I encounter people nearly every day of my life who are filled with worry, concern and anxiety.
[time=1498] Quite often there are some legitimate reasons for their concerns.
[time=1502] Other times our concern is far disproportionate to the reality of our problem.
[time=1508] Perhaps you're one of those like me who struggle from time to time with worry.
[time=1512] If you are we have an excellent little pamphlet to strengthen you in your spiritual life and it's entitled worry.
[time=1520] We'd love to send you a copy of How to Live Without Worry Today.
[time=1524] If you would simply write to us we would send it to you as a gift from us to you so that you can pour over the scriptures in this booklet
[time=1532] and the helpful insights and begin to combat the problem of worry.
[time=1536] Write to us today and we'll send you your copy.
[time=1540] You can receive this pamphlet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1548] Write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1556] Please do write for that helpful booklet on worry but unfortunately we cannot encourage you to write for living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=1564] When people write in for tickets quite often we get their request when the tickets are gone for the concert they wanted.
[time=1570] We write them back with available dates, they write back and by that time every ticket is gone.
[time=1576] So you must either call us or come by and pick those tickets up.
[time=1578] But for the booklet on worry please do write to us today.
[time=1582] Once again our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1590] Thank you for joining us today and we trust that as our worship service continues you'll stay with us and allow the Spirit of God to minister in your life.
[time=1606] [MUSIC - 176 seconds]
[time=1790] Thank you Scott, would you pray with me? God you've quieted our hearts through a song. The gentleness of a string instrument.
[time=1800] This hammer would strike a chord. Familiar words would come to our mind. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=1812] God we've come today to this hour of worship. Too many of us out of tradition. It's Sunday. It's 11 o'clock.
[time=1822] Yet God there is also that compelling awareness that we are saved, that we've been forgiven and we've come today to celebrate your grace.
[time=1832] And Father today we would pray that you would capture every mind that is here today and hold it captive and force our attention to focus on you.
[time=1844] We worship you today because you are God and because of the grace that you have given to us in Christ.
[time=1852] Father we pray that there might be those who are with us today who understand like Michael did in the first service that they need Christ and who would receive him.
[time=1864] We pray for believers who are struggling today with obedience that there would come a sense of realization that God owns our lives and we must obey him.
[time=1874] We pray for some young men who've had the heritage of a Christian home but who have violated that trust and that inheritance and are following is in the words of Paul the ways of this world.
[time=1886] We pray that you would give parents and students alike strength as they fight spiritual battles against strong powers.
[time=1896] The power of alcohol and of drugs, the power of sexual temptation, the power of materialism, the power of hate and of greed and of pride.
[time=1906] God we pray that you would work in those lives of young men and young women who today need to be rescued from themselves and the sins that they're choosing.
[time=1918] We would rejoice today in those who have found victory over sin for those lives that have been redeemed.
[time=1926] We thank you for progressing in Doug's life and in Tonya's life.
[time=1930] Father we would pray today for single parents who face life's greatest responsibility alone that they would find you as their partner in their enablement.
[time=1942] We pray for those today God who aren't fighting problems of health or family or fortune.
[time=1950] That in those days of comfort we would not rest in ourselves but trust in you and not simply be given over to pleasure but look at today as a unique opportunity for service in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1966] While I was a seminary student, a number of things were required. Greek, Hebrew, theology, Bible and chapel.
[time=1974] Four days a week, chapel at ten o'clock.
[time=1978] I found a comfortable spot in the last row of the chapel.
[time=1982] There I was joined by some friends of equal commitment to enjoying chapel.
[time=1988] One of the ways we passed the time was to rewrite some of the great hymns of the faith.
[time=1994] And so while the rest of the student body was singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=2000] We sat in the back and sang amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like you and you and you and you up in the front.
[time=2008] Or I was sinking deep in sin, won't you come and push me in?
[time=2014] Or heaven came down, watch out, here it comes we'd make little noise and sound effects and get them giggling halfway up.
[time=2022] You have to know all the deans at every school I want to quite well.
[time=2026] But there's this Christian song.
[time=2028] Take my life and let it be.
[time=2032] I wonder how many of us don't want to sing that to God.
[time=2034] Take my life and let it be.
[time=2038] God just let it be, it's my life.
[time=2042] Instead of take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to the my life.
[time=2050] God let it be.
[time=2052] Is it your life?
[time=2054] Turn with me if you will to Matthew chapter 21 in verse 33.
[time=2060] This is one of Jesus many parables, one of those unique ways that he taught people by taking illustrations out of their everyday life and teaching an eternal principle from that.
[time=2072] This parable is called the parable of the householder, it might be better called the parable of the wicked tenants.
[time=2080] I'm going to read verses 33 through 40 for you.
[time=2084] Here another parable.
[time=2088] There was a certain house holder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and dig the wine press in it and build a tower and let it out to husband men and went into a far country.
[time=2106] And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husband men that they might receive the fruits of it.
[time=2116] And the husband men took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another.
[time=2124] Again, he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise.
[time=2134] But last of all, he sent unto them his son, saying, they will reverence my son.
[time=2142] But when the husband men saw the son, they said among themselves, this is the heir.
[time=2150] Come, let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance.
[time=2156] And they caught him and they cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.
[time=2162] When the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those wicked husband men?
[time=2172] Jesus was here trying to teach a very basic lesson.
[time=2178] He used a historical situation, one which they understood very, very well.
[time=2184] Something that was not only common then, but it's common now.
[time=2188] It's a man who has a fair degree of wealth who owns a piece of property and he's not interested in farming the ground himself.
[time=2196] What he would really rather do is get somebody to rent the property and go to Florida for the winner.
[time=2202] So that's exactly what he did.
[time=2204] He rent out the property and it says he went away to a far country.
[time=2208] He was an absentee landlord.
[time=2210] That was not uncommon then and it's not at all uncommon today.
[time=2214] In recent years our church has been land rich and cash poor.
[time=2218] And in those days some of the land we owned at Arlington Park and across the street, we would rent out to farmers just as this was being done in the biblical times.
[time=2228] When that occurred there was some type of financial arrangement that was agreed upon.
[time=2234] It might be a simple price per acre, a hundred dollars per acre rent for the farmland.
[time=2240] Or instead of a cash agreement it might be a share crop agreement where the owner agrees to lease the land to the farming tenant in exchange for 33% of the yield or some other agreed amount.
[time=2254] Or there could be a third arrangement where it wouldn't be a percentage it would just be a bushel per acre.
[time=2262] Regardless of how big or small the yield was, the land owner first got his amount.
[time=2268] That was the situation here.
[time=2270] The farmer agreed to let the land out for agricultural purposes and when the productivity was ended he sent his collecting agency to get his share of the crop.
[time=2284] That was very common in those days and today.
[time=2288] So they understood the principle that Jesus was teaching.
[time=2290] But when Jesus talked about a vineyard they understood it even more clearly.
[time=2296] Back in Isaiah chapter five you might want to stick your bulletin right here and Matthew and turn to Isaiah chapter five.
[time=2306] There's another passage about a vineyard.
[time=2312] Without reading all of these verses for you verses one through six says God speaking he said I've planted a vineyard and I have taken care of my vineyard and I've given it everything that it needs.
[time=2324] And in verse seven of chapter five he says this for the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel.
[time=2334] Every Israeli who heard Jesus parable not only understood the agricultural illustration that he was giving here but when he talked about a vineyard that perked their ears up and they knew he was talking about them.
[time=2350] Now as we look at this a parable often is trying to parallel a natural situation with a spiritual truth.
[time=2362] And there are four key principles of parallel here.
[time=2366] The first of all when you read the story the first person you meet is the land owner.
[time=2372] This land owner has developed the ground.
[time=2374] It's not just a bare piece of farmland he's developed it in three ways.
[time=2380] First of all he has put a stone hedge about it that is to not only define the boundary of the land but that stone hedge will keep out marauding animals.
[time=2390] Secondly he's equipped the land with a wine press that allowed the tenant to take the raw product the grapes and to convert it into something that was marketable, transportable, preservable and profitable.
[time=2404] It was set up for business ready to go and finally he developed it with a tower.
[time=2410] That would be a place where a man could watch for robbers and for fire.
[time=2414] It was kind of an early security and smoke detection system.
[time=2420] The land was developed and ready to go and it was then turned over to the tenants.
[time=2426] Now the point of parallel is this, just as there was a land owner who owned that developed piece of ground there is a land owner who owns you, me and everything that we think we possess.
[time=2438] And that of course is God.
[time=2442] In Psalm 24 verse 1 it says the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof.
[time=2448] Now most of us when we picture the earth globally this big sphere we say yes the earth is the Lord but notice that next phrase and the fullness thereof.
[time=2458] That means everything that's on this globe God also owns it.
[time=2462] He just doesn't own the sod, he owns the house and the things in the house and the people who live in the house he owns it all.
[time=2472] In Psalm 50 verse 10 it says every animal of the forest is mine.
[time=2476] I guess I think of the wild deer and the elk and the moose, those belong to God.
[time=2482] But he says the animals of the forest are mine and the cattle on the thousand hill.
[time=2490] Those domesticated animals, those animals walking around with somebody else's brand on their backside God says I don't care whose brand they are, I own them.
[time=2500] They are mine.
[time=2502] God claims ownership over everything.
[time=2504] In Leviticus chapter 25 God said this the land must not be sold permanently because the land is mine and you are but aliens and strangers.
[time=2518] How many of you own your own house, you don't need to raise your hand.
[time=2520] I own my own house.
[time=2522] Now that I've said that actually I own the keys to the front door.
[time=2528] I don't own the house.
[time=2530] The house is owned by a kind lady that we bought it from on land contract who lives in Columbia City.
[time=2536] But actually she doesn't own the house, she still has a mortgage on it with a bank back here in Fort Wayne Indiana.
[time=2544] Ah, they own the house.
[time=2546] No, they don't own the house.
[time=2548] That bank was bought out by a bigger bank in Michigan.
[time=2550] They own the house.
[time=2552] I'm not sure there may be some other deal going on up in Michigan.
[time=2556] Whoever owns that house, I wish they had come cut the grass.
[time=2560] It desperately needs it.
[time=2562] I don't own that house.
[time=2564] Somebody else owns that.
[time=2566] But beyond the land contract and beyond the banks and beyond the conglomerates, they don't own that land.
[time=2574] God owns the land and you and I are but strangers and aliens passing through here.
[time=2580] Temporary residents.
[time=2582] We don't own a thing.
[time=2584] Some of you are saying, "Well, I've been at this game a little bit longer than you have, Rick.
[time=2588] And I've got all my mortgages paid off and I still own that land." Is that right?
[time=2594] You don't have to pay any taxes.
[time=2596] You see, the United States government thinks they own that land.
[time=2598] And there's a law called the law of eminent domain.
[time=2602] If they decide that your house would be a wonderful place for a freeway, they won't ask you.
[time=2608] They'll come and say, "Here's how much your property is worth." Kindly move by the 15th of the month.
[time=2616] And yet the United States government doesn't own that land.
[time=2618] God owns that land.
[time=2620] And he's the one that raises one nation up and another nation down.
[time=2626] Haggie I-28, God says, "I'm not only on the land.
[time=2628] I own all the gold and I own the silver.
[time=2630] I own the hill.
[time=2632] I own the cattle on the hill and I own the branding iron." You use to put your name on them with.
[time=2636] God says, "I own it all." God says, "I own your life." Ezekiel, chapter 18, verse 4.
[time=2646] "For every soul belongs to me, the Father and the Son.
[time=2652] Both belong to me and the soul that sins it will die." God's got two titles on our life, two claims.
[time=2660] One is the claim of Creator.
[time=2662] He has made us, we are His creatures.
[time=2664] We belong to Him.
[time=2666] The second is that we were enslaved to sin and Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins.
[time=2674] We've been bought with a price.
[time=2676] We are not our own.
[time=2678] The Apostle Paul wrote that to the Church of Corinth, 1 Corinthians, chapter 6, verses 19 and 20.
[time=2684] Just like this man owned the land that he rented out, God says, "I own your land.
[time=2692] I own your house.
[time=2692] I own your clothes.
[time=2694] I own everything." It all belongs to you.
[time=2698] I don't own these clothes.
[time=2700] I don't own the changes that I keep in my pockets on Sunday morning so I can sneak over to the pop machine between services.
[time=2706] I don't own a thing.
[time=2710] You don't either.
[time=2712] You don't own your own life.
[time=2714] How many of you chose to be born?
[time=2716] How many of you said, "God, I'm ready to be born?" October the 29th, 1952, vintage year, I'll go then.
[time=2726] How many of you chose who your parents were?
[time=2728] We will not ask how many we would like to re-choose who your parents are.
[time=2732] We didn't choose that.
[time=2734] How many of you chose where you were going to be born?
[time=2736] None of us will choose how long we'll live.
[time=2740] Our days are in His hand.
[time=2740] He owns you.
[time=2742] He owns me.
[time=2742] He owns everything that we think we own.
[time=2746] There's a second parallel.
[time=2748] The parallel of the owner is followed by the parallel of the tenant.
[time=2752] The tenants were meant to represent the house of Israel.
[time=2756] They knew that from Isaiah chapter 5 that when he was talking about the vineyard, he was talking about them.
[time=2764] But let's not just take this in such a strict dispensational sense that we push this back to Israel.
[time=2770] It's talking just as much to us today that we belong to God.
[time=2774] But the tenants were the nation of Israel who had entered into a covenant relationship with God and who were failing to keep their covenant.
[time=2782] They had the land.
[time=2784] They had the developed hedge, tower and wine press.
[time=2788] They had the productivity of the land, but they didn't honor God with the first fruits of their lives.
[time=2792] And that leads us to the third person, the third parallel.
[time=2800] And those were the servants.
[time=2802] Today we would call those servants, accountants, lawyers, collection agencies.
[time=2810] The man sent his servants again and again, and they were mistreated and even killed.
[time=2816] The parallel of that is the parallel of the Old Testament prophets all the way down to John the Baptist.
[time=2822] Turn two chapters later, if you will, to Matthew 23.
[time=2826] And while you're looking for that, allow me to introduce Matthew 23 to you.
[time=2830] If you find Christianity undesirable because you picture Jesus Christ as a soft, easygoing guy,
[time=2840] who never had a callous in his hands and never confronted life at its difficulty,
[time=2846] a guy who always spoke softly and gently, you've misjudged the Savior.
[time=2850] Matthew 23 and verse 33, this is Jesus' remarks to the religious leaders of his day.
[time=2860] You serpents, you generation of vipers, comes right out of Dale Carnegie's book on how to win friends and influence people.
[time=2870] Today's translation would put it this way. Jesus looked at him and said, "You snake in the grass." I mean, that's not actually a soft, passive guy. I'm able to confront life.
[time=2880] And he says to these people, "How shall you escape the damn nation of hell?
[time=2888] "Wherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes, "and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in synagogues
[time=2898] "and persecute them from city to city, that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth,
[time=2906] "the blood of righteous able unto the blood of Zachariah." A little bit of lesson here. First of all, he says in verse 34, "You shall shed it."
[time=2916] It's future. He was looking at his own life and he was looking at the life of Stephen
[time=2922] and of Peter, who would later be put to death and scourge.
[time=2926] But he was also looking past from the righteous blood of Abel.
[time=2930] That was the first man who died, the book of Genesis, to the life of Zachariah who reigned during the time
[time=2936] or who prophesied during the last times of the Old Testament.
[time=2940] He was saying, "From them till now and from now till future, the tenants have mistreated my representatives."
[time=2950] There's a fourth and final parallel. There's the parallel of the owner, the parallel of the tenants,
[time=2956] the parallel of the servants, and the parallel of the son.
[time=2960] Verse 37 of chapter 21 says, "But last of all, he sent unto them his son, saying they will reverence my son."
[time=2970] In fact, they did not only fail to reverence him, they mistreated him.
[time=2978] They recognized him coming as the son and their greedy mind says, "If we can get rid of him,
[time=2984] there'll be no heir to the throne or excuse me, heir to the title of this land, and it'll be ours."
[time=2992] Possession is nine-tenths of the law. We'll homestead this ground. We just need to get rid of him.
[time=3002] The parallel of course is the son that was sent, is the son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=3008] who came giving a final message of appeal and was crucified and put to death.
[time=3014] Hebrews chapter 1 says this, "Speaking of Christ, his son, by whom he hath appointed heir of all things,
[time=3022] by whom also he made the world, who is being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person,
[time=3028] and upholding all things by the word of his power." Christ is that son, that heir.
[time=3040] Those four parallels can now give to us four very, very practical lessons.
[time=3048] The first practical lesson that I would like to share with you is this one.
[time=3052] They're each a responsibility. The first is a responsibility to recognize God's ownership over everything.
[time=3062] God has blessed our family with two cars, a white one and a blue one.
[time=3068] I'm not an overly fussy person. My kids probably would disagree with that if they had the microphone today.
[time=3076] I don't like to keep bananas under the car seat for three or four weeks at a time.
[time=3080] They do. And I always am saying, "Keep my car clean. My car."
[time=3090] You want to know something? That's not my car. It's your car.
[time=3094] The church leases that car and gives it to me to use. It's not my car, it's your car.
[time=3098] Actually, it's not your car. It belongs to an Oldsmobile dealership here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, from whom you lease it.
[time=3106] Actually, it's not their car because they turn the lease over to a bank. But I've got the keys.
[time=3112] That's what our life really is. We don't own a thing, but because we've got the keys, we think we own it.
[time=3120] Because we have the suit, we think we own it. Because this life is called Rick Hawks.
[time=3126] I think Rick Hawks owns it. We don't own a thing.
[time=3130] And our first responsibility is to recognize God owns everything.
[time=3134] Our second responsibility is this. It is to respond to God's message.
[time=3142] These people had God's messengers coming again and again and again, and they refused to respond to it.
[time=3148] They ignored it, and when it became too strong to be ignored, they refused it to the point of rejecting it at death.
[time=3158] Starting off by talking about the song. Take my life and let it be.
[time=3164] That's responding to God's word. Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to thee.
[time=3172] Take my hands. Take my feet. Take my moments. Take my hours. Take my will and make it mine.
[time=3180] You see, we have a responsibility to respond in obedience to what God has said in his word.
[time=3186] Not to respond to what our appetites want to do. Not to respond to what our friends are pressuring us to do.
[time=3192] Not to respond with what we think. If I do that, I'll really impress them.
[time=3200] But to respond in obedience to God's word.
[time=3204] Our third responsibility is the responsibility to return to God his part.
[time=3210] The landowner sent out his representatives to collect only what was his due.
[time=3220] They weren't trying to extract anything that wasn't due.
[time=3222] There was an agreement and they failed to keep the agreement.
[time=3228] We have a responsibility to God. In the word of God, we're called stewards.
[time=3232] A steward is a middle manager. We don't own it. We simply represent somebody else who does own it.
[time=3238] And we are to use those funds and resources according to the wishes of the owner.
[time=3244] If God owns everything and he entrusts it to us as middle managers,
[time=3250] then it's our responsibility to return to him for his use, his things, his money as he directs.
[time=3258] We'll study this concept for a whole Sunday, next Sunday morning.
[time=3260] But it will allow me to repeat this simple outline. It is a responsibility.
[time=3266] 1 Corinthians 16 2 says, "On the first day of the week, let each one of you lay up in store as God has prospered him."
[time=3274] That makes it a responsibility.
[time=3276] Giving and returning to the Lord is not the responsibility of those who've been here long.
[time=3280] It's not the responsibility of those who make more.
[time=3284] It's not the responsibility of those who come more often and therefore are taking more.
[time=3288] It says, "Let each one of us." Secondly, it's not only a responsibility. It's something that we're to do regularly.
[time=3296] It says, "On the first day of the week." We don't give because we like that project and we don't stop giving because we don't like that one.
[time=3302] We don't give because that needs in crisis and we don't stop needing because there's not a crisis.
[time=3308] We give regularly, systematically and orderly.
[time=3312] Thirdly, we give proportionally, it says, "Out of our resources, as God has prospered you, so let a man give."
[time=3322] That's a third responsibility to return to God, what is his.
[time=3326] And then there's this fourth responsibility, the responsibility to receive his son as our Savior.
[time=3338] Earlier in our service, the choir sang from Philippians chapter 2 verses 9 and 10.
[time=3344] "Every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess to the glory of God that Jesus is Lord."
[time=3354] You will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=3356] There is no question about if you will make that confession.
[time=3360] The only question is when will you make that confession?
[time=3364] You have two choices.
[time=3366] Your choice is not if it's a choice between two possible wands.
[time=3370] You could receive him now.
[time=3374] Out of grace, you could ask him to come into your heart and to be your Savior and he will forgive you.
[time=3380] And when you confess that he is Lord, he will forgive you of all of your sins and give you a new life.
[time=3386] That's your first choice.
[time=3388] Your second choice is to not receive Christ as Savior, not to confess him today, and they'll come a day after you die.
[time=3396] That you'll stand before him, no longer a Savior and Lord, but as judge and Lord, and you will be forced.
[time=3404] Before you are sent the hell, you'll be forced to bow your knee and confess that Jesus is Lord.
[time=3412] You will make that confession.
[time=3414] The only choice is when.
[time=3416] Now, receive him in love as Savior or later to meet him as judge.
[time=3424] These wicked servants rejected him.
[time=3430] What will you do with him?
[time=3432] One hymn writer put it this way.
[time=3436] We're the whole realm of nature, mine, that we're an offering far too small.
[time=3444] Love so amazing, so divine demands my soul, my life, my all.
[time=3456] Would you today accept these four responsibilities to recognize God's ownership over everything, including you?
[time=3468] To respond in obedience to him at his word.
[time=3476] To return unto him faithfully, that which he asked of you.
[time=3482] And finally, most importantly, though final on our list first in your order of decisions,
[time=3488] receive Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3494] We're the whole realm of nature, mine, that and offering far too small.
[time=3500] Love so amazing, so divine demands my soul, my life, my all.
[time=3512] We've been sharing with you today the music ministry of Crystal Hall and Scott Schindler
[time=3522] and the message from the Word of God from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3526] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3530] Just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3534] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3538] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3544] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3548] I ask you to come in today and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and to cleanse me.
[time=3552] Please come in to my heart right now, in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3560] If you've made a decision today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3564] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3572] To receive a copy of "Your Decision" or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "How to Live Without Worry",
