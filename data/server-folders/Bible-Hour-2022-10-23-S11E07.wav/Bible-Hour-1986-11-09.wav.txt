[time=90] I know that church is not the place to use or to talk about four-letter words.
[time=112] But there's one four-letter word that we must talk about from time to time.
[time=116] I know that this will be offensive to many of you, but please forgive me.
[time=120] The four-letter word for today is the word "give." Speaking about giving and money can be a frustration to many, many people.
[time=129] Will Rogers once said that we spend money that we have not earned to buy things we don't even want to impress people that we don't like?
[time=139] (bells ringing)
[time=150] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=153] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=155] Today Rick's message is taken from 2 Corinthians, chapters 8 and 9, and is entitled Principles for Giving.
[time=163] Nothing is more discomforting than a sermon on money, both for the listener and for the speaker.
[time=168] Why is this so?
[time=170] Largely because we misunderstand God's principles on the subject of money.
[time=176] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 2 Corinthians.
[time=180] We will be looking at chapters 8 and 9.
[time=184] Today's special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir.
[time=189] We'll also be hearing from Rejoice and Lynn Rowell.
[time=197] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne,
[time=204] Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=208] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=214] Now here's Rick.
[time=217] I want to share a special word of welcome to our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=222] Today we're glad that each of you are here, but it's always special to look out and to see friends who are here, but we don't often get to see.
[time=230] Mike and Carolyn Ballast have been missionaries for the last 4 years in the Philippines.
[time=234] They've been home for about 5 months, but they're hardly ever home because they're always visiting other churches,
[time=240] holding Bible conferences and missions conferences, and they're here today.
[time=244] Mary Cruz is home here with us from Japan.
[time=247] Charles Johns is on our platform from India and Steve Maria Gardner are home.
[time=252] We're gathering them from the four corners of the globe, and each of you are here today, and it's a joy to come together.
[time=259] What's our purpose?
[time=260] To worship our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=263] To lift up His name, to magnify His name, and to proclaim His glory.
[time=269] I know of no greater way to do that than to listen to our choirs they sing of the majestic name of our Savior and of our God.
[time=282] [MUSIC - 134 seconds]
[time=426] And may we continue to lift the name of the Lord high and worship His name.
[time=431] Oh, worship the King all glorious above.
[time=434] Him number 11 will sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=439] Him number 11.
[time=441] [MUSIC - 93 seconds]
[time=544] As I mentioned a moment ago, we have with us today one of our missionaries, Charles John.
[time=551] It's our privilege as a church to support over 40 different missionaries, and I wish there was a way that all of us could keep every one of their names and missions and missionaries in our mind.
[time=563] One of the ways that we can do that is to have them here as often as we can.
[time=567] And the second way is in the lobby of this auditorium we're hanging the pictures of all of our missionaries.
[time=573] So as you go out today, along with fighting the crowd, look up on the wall to the south side and you'll see the beginning of the pictures of many of our missionaries.
[time=582] I'm going to ask Charles to come and introduce him to you.
[time=585] Charles has been a missionary to the country of India where actually the modern missions movement began.
[time=592] It was there that William Carey began his work as a missionary and inspired so many others.
[time=597] Charles, how long have you been serving as a missionary to India?
[time=601] We have been in the country of India since 1977.
[time=605] So somewhere between nine and ten years you've been there serving in India.
[time=609] Are there many other missionaries there co-laboring with you?
[time=612] At the place where we have been working, we are all by ourselves.
[time=617] There are five other missionaries under the Baptist Midmissions in the south central part of India, a place called Bangalore.
[time=624] Now you have told me earlier that that number of six missionaries is greatly diminished from days gone by.
[time=631] That is correct, Pastor.
[time=633] There was a time when we had over 33 missionaries under the Baptist Midmissions in the land of India.
[time=640] Today we have just six missionaries, five of them in Bangalore and my wife in Trivandrum, India, that makes six people in India at the moment.
[time=650] Well, he said his wife is there, his wife and youngest son went back to maintain the ministry.
[time=655] There will be two more months before he's reunited with them on January the 9th.
[time=660] But explain a little bit why it is that the number has shrunk from 33 down to 6.
[time=666] Ever since India got independence in 1947.
[time=669] It has been the policy of the government to reduce the number of foreign missionaries present in the country.
[time=677] It is their contention that if the Christianity is a national religion, the national Christians ought to be proliferating that into various parts of the country.
[time=689] In other words, they should be doing the evangelization rather than foreign missionaries.
[time=695] Well, God has really made you a unique ambassador for Christ then.
[time=699] You don't have any trouble getting a visa, do you?
[time=701] That is correct. I do not require a visa because I am a citizen of India.
[time=705] My wife also is a citizen and two of our children are citizens who are preparing to go back to India.
[time=713] They are in different schools in the States at the moment.
[time=716] Charles, last hour described his work there in India as what he called multi-dimensional.
[time=722] Explain some of the different ministries you are involved with there.
[time=726] The first ministry that we are heavily involved is the first Baptist Church of Trevandrum,
[time=733] which was founded during our first term of service.
[time=737] And then in 1978 we started a Good News Bible Correspondence School.
[time=743] Today we have over 12,000 students enrolled in the Good News Bible Correspondence Program.
[time=749] This means that we are reaching 12,000 different homes throughout India.
[time=754] Otherwise, we would have never been able to reach them.
[time=758] This includes several hundreds in Hindus.
[time=763] Our students of our Correspondence School, we have a number of Muslims or Islam, and then we have hundreds of nominal Christians who do go to church or do not go to church,
[time=774] but do not know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=778] Many of these people, down through the last nine years, have come to the saving grace of Jesus Christ
[time=784] through the study of our Good News Bible Correspondence School.
[time=787] Charles, that's exciting to hear about that.
[time=790] What one thing would you most want our people to pray for as they think of you and as they think of India?
[time=795] Pastor mentioned about these multi-dimensional ministries, which include the first Baptist Church of Trevandrum,
[time=801] the Good News Bible Correspondence School, the Baptist Evangelistic Center, then we have an Evangelistic Youth Movement, which came out of the graduates who graduated from the Good News Correspondence School,
[time=814] and also we have a ministry among the Islamic people called Project Islamic Evangelization.
[time=820] In spite of all these various ministries, the one thing, if you are praying only for one thing, we want you to pray for the Ministry of the Good News Bible Correspondence School.
[time=829] The main reason is that we are training nationals to reach out to other nationals.
[time=835] So these graduates from the Good News Correspondence School will go into different parts of India, and they will establish independent fundamental Baptist churches.
[time=845] Let's pray for that right now.
[time=847] God, we are thankful that you have raised up Charles and his family as Indians to missionary work to the country of India.
[time=856] As we see the doors creeping shut to outside influences, we pray for his influence as a national,
[time=864] that you would allow the Good News Correspondence Bible Classes to train other nationals so that they could in turn multiply the work of the ministry.
[time=873] We pray for their influence amongst every part of India, but particularly amongst those Muslim people who do not know Christ and the Hindus,
[time=882] and those who know the name but do not know faith in Christ.
[time=886] We pray your richest blessing upon them, that you will meet their every need and spiritually in power
[time=892] and strengthen them, that they might have power in winning people to Christ.
[time=897] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, Amen.
[time=901] Well, we've taken Charles off to train our college and career class and a heart for missions.
[time=908] So he's going to be speaking there. He was with us the full hour last time, but do pray for Charles.
[time=914] And we would pray for the whole sphere of missions that we might have influence for Christ.
[time=919] Our music group Rejoice is now going to encourage us to do just that by proclaiming the glory of the Lord.
[time=950] We pray in proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=954] Let every tongue confess He reigns without His name in praises forever proclaim.
[time=960] The glory of the Lord.
[time=963] Let long as my teachings you all take up the call, let every nation know.
[time=969] These are Messiah, our Savior and our King.
[time=973] Let all of our sisters join us one and fill the earth with singing.
[time=978] Glory to our God, His greatest we applaud.
[time=982] Let every race on every shore proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=1000] We pray in proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=1008] Give honor to the Prince of Peace for if we cease the storms we'll start shouting.
[time=1014] We pray in proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=1018] With hands afflicted, let us raise Him or to praise Him who reigns on high.
[time=1024] Let all of our sisters join us one and fill the earth with singing.
[time=1029] Glory to our God, His greatest we applaud.
[time=1033] Let every race on every shore proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=1043] The glory of the Lord is our Messiah, our Savior and our King.
[time=1050] Let all of our sisters join us one and fill the earth with singing.
[time=1054] Glory to our God, His greatest we applaud.
[time=1058] Let every race on every shore proclaim the glory.
[time=1065] Proclaim the glory, proclaim the glory, proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=1081] Hello again, in this moment we're taking a brief exit from our live morning worship service.
[time=1089] So the Pete and I can share a few moments with you about some other events coming up in the life of our church.
[time=1094] For which we would like to include you.
[time=1097] Please forgive us if we seem a little tired, but Pete had a major concert here last night.
[time=1102] And how you've gotten the gym turned back around into a church service and have that smiles beyond me.
[time=1107] Oric, I think we have to attribute a lot of that to our maintenance crew.
[time=1110] Sometimes they're behind the scenes and don't get the recognition that they need, but they were into the wee hours of the morning getting ready for our worship service today.
[time=1118] As a result of the worship and praise service we had with far other churches in our area.
[time=1124] And it was a great time of fellowship and praise to the Lord.
[time=1127] Well, for those of you who had a part to see that, I know that you enjoyed it.
[time=1131] But for those of you who didn't, you missed a great opportunity last night with, oh, probably a 150 voices singing and praising the Lord.
[time=1139] We had a joyful time listening and being encouraged.
[time=1143] But there's another great opportunity coming up and that's the 1986 Living Christmas Tree.
[time=1148] A number of concerts and tickets will become available this coming Saturday, November 15th.
[time=1154] Saturday, November 15th we open our Convocation Center here at 9 o'clock and we're here all day to present to you the public tickets.
[time=1163] They're free, you need to come early, you get a number and we quickly disperse probably about 12 to 13,000 tickets just that day.
[time=1171] Well, that's a task that I'm thankful. I'm not responsible for it, but there's a great crew of volunteers who pass those out.
[time=1178] And if you would like to have tickets to this year's Living Christmas Tree, you can come to the church at 7321 East State Boulevard this Saturday, November 15th,
[time=1189] anytime from 9 o'clock into the afternoon and the tickets will be available here.
[time=1194] They're available on the first come, first serve basis and they're available in limited quantities.
[time=1199] From time to time people show up, want to know if they can have as many as several hundred tickets and of course we cannot do that.
[time=1205] That deprives others of having tickets, but we would love to have you and your friends come, so if you would like tickets it's this Saturday, November 15th.
[time=1214] That's right and we do encourage you to come that day.
[time=1217] There are tickets available from now till December 11th, the first concert, but of course as you come early you have a better choice of 14 concerts that will be presented.
[time=1227] Now, we don't want you to worry about getting your tickets, so we have a booklet for you today called Worry.
[time=1233] It's a booklet that gives some principles from God's Word as to how each of us can learn to live without worry.
[time=1242] That's one of the most common problems. It's something that every one of us will deal with.
[time=1247] We'll always have concerns, we'll always have health, finances, children, marriage, business problems.
[time=1254] But how do we live with those and how do we beat worry?
[time=1257] Well, the Bible gives us a number of good prescriptions.
[time=1260] It tells us to be anxious about nothing but instead come to God in prayer about everything.
[time=1268] Well, that's just one of many biblical principles that will be shared with you in this booklet.
[time=1273] And we'd love to send you a copy free as a gift from us to you for simply writing and asking for it.
[time=1279] We'll send you this booklet on how to live without worry.
[time=1282] If you'd like to receive this booklet, just simply write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1292] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1299] Well, thank you again for joining us for our morning worship service.
[time=1303] And for those of you who do not have an evening worship service, we always want to invite you to join us here at Blackhawk Baptist Church at six o'clock.
[time=1311] During this week, we're having what we call a practical living seminar.
[time=1315] There are 11 different elective classes you can take on dealing with the drug problem, Zig Ziglar's film on how to raise positive kids in a negative world, how to discover God's will for your life, and the list goes on and on.
[time=1329] We'd love to have you as a part of our evening ministry.
[time=1332] If your church does not have an evening service, feel free to join us.
[time=1336] Again, we hope that you do write for the book on how to live without worry and we'll send you a copy today.
[time=1342] Thank you for joining us, and may God encourage you and bless you as you faithfully study His Word and follow Him.
[time=1370] We are your children, help us know just what to say.
[time=1383] Teach us to worship.
[time=1388] Love and adore thee with your understanding to each other.
[time=1402] Teach us to pray.
[time=1418] Lead us in truth.
[time=1423] Show us thy way.
[time=1428] Grant us thy wisdom.
[time=1433] Speak and we'll obey.
[time=1439] Teach us to worship.
[time=1444] Love and adore thee with your understanding to each other.
[time=1459] Teach us to pray.
[time=1479] With your understanding, teach us.
[time=1488] Teach us to pray.
[time=1508] Thank you, Lynn.
[time=1512] Our Father, as those disciples did ask, we too today would say Lord, teach us to pray.
[time=1522] Father, as I would listen to that song, I must confess to you that my own prayer life sounds too much like my children's Christmas list.
[time=1532] An endless list of wants and expectations.
[time=1537] Father, we today would come to confess to you that we more often come in prayer to ask for ourselves than to give of ourselves, and we today want to pray like your disciples were taught.
[time=1553] And we say today, Father, your kingdom come and your will be done on earth just as it is in heaven.
[time=1562] God, forgive us for always trying to make our will your will instead of submitting.
[time=1568] And so today, God, as a church and as individuals, we recommit ourselves to your will.
[time=1575] We subordinate ourselves to your kingdom.
[time=1580] We make of ourselves clay and put ourselves as clay into your hands.
[time=1586] So as the potter, Lord, shape us into instruments of your use.
[time=1591] If you choose to exalt us to glorify yourself, God, then lift us up.
[time=1595] If God, if you choose to humble us as a way of glorifying yourself, then Lord cast us down in humility.
[time=1602] We are yours.
[time=1604] Do with us as you will.
[time=1608] And yet, Lord, with that spirit of submission, we still today find ourselves asking, and asking with boldness and confidence through Jesus Christ.
[time=1618] He has given us the privilege of asking, so today, Father, we ask.
[time=1623] We would ask for your hand to be upon Carol Chapin as she carries a child and has suffered miscarriages before.
[time=1631] We pray for Audra Richard as she has been victim of several seizures in her infancy that you would give her doctor's wisdom.
[time=1640] We would pray today for those who have suffered loss of loved ones and who are still adjusting.
[time=1647] And perhaps never will fully adjust to the loneliness that you would be their companion.
[time=1653] We would pray today that through your word, each of us would be challenged.
[time=1659] As you said in the parable Lord, the cares of the world often choke us out.
[time=1664] God, keep anyone today from missing you because of the cares of the world that preoccupy their mind.
[time=1673] God, we don't want to know about you.
[time=1676] We want to know you.
[time=1678] As Paul said in the fellowship of your suffering and in the power of your resurrection, make yourself known today in Jesus' name.
[time=1688] [AMEN] A number of years ago, a circus went from community to community with a variety of side shows.
[time=1698] One of the most popular was the circus strong man.
[time=1701] The circus strong man would do a variety of feats that seemed superhuman in power,
[time=1707] taking a barbell that very few men could lift off of the ground and picking it up as though it was nothing and lifting it straight over its head.
[time=1716] But one of the favorite tricks of the strong man was to take a regular orange in the palm of his hand
[time=1722] and before the crowd squeeze it, every drop of juice dripping out of it and crushing it into pure pulp.
[time=1732] Then turning to the audience and saying, "I'll give a hundred dollars to any man who can squeeze one more drop of juice out of this."
[time=1741] In one particular town, the local hero, the local athlete and strong man stepped up with a swagger sure that he could get at least one more drop out.
[time=1750] And he grabbed it with one hand and he squeezed and he squeezed and you could see the muscles bulging in his arm,
[time=1757] the blood rushing to his head, the veins popping out and he squeezed and not one drop came out.
[time=1765] The crowd both laughed and cheered and the man went back to his seat defeated and the strong man puffing out his chest
[time=1773] about to brag until one more voice was heard.
[time=1776] This time a rather high voice saying, "Let me give that a try." Everyone turned around and this was no athlete, this was no strong man about to try.
[time=1785] Upstood a man whose biceps looked very much like that crushed orange, not much there.
[time=1792] On his way up to the platform he tripped, pushed the glasses back on his eyes and took the pulp in his hand
[time=1800] and without even a look of strain he squeezed the orange and two drops came out.
[time=1805] The crowd cheered and laughed even louder this time.
[time=1809] The circus strong man looked greatly defeated and handed over the hundred dollars and said, "Tell me something."
[time=1816] How did you get juice out of that?
[time=1819] The little man said, "Really, there's not much to it.
[time=1822] I'm the treasure of the local Baptist Church. I'm used to squeezing." Isn't that the way we feel sometimes?
[time=1833] When somebody talks about money, our finances are giving, all of us begin to feel the fingers of the church treasure circling our body,
[time=1844] gripping us tighter, drawing around us like the python.
[time=1848] We feel squeezed.
[time=1852] Most of us can take any amount of discussion or finger pointing about giving more of our time or giving more of our talent,
[time=1860] but you mentioned giving more of our money and we all feel uncomfortable and underline the word "we."
[time=1866] I didn't say "you." We treat in most of our churches words like "give" as though they're a four-letter word.
[time=1877] Incidentally, it is.
[time=1880] And to talk about sacrificial giving and offerings, it's almost like a form of verbal pornography.
[time=1888] It's an obscene discussion.
[time=1890] Doesn't he know they're children in the auditorium? He shouldn't be talking like that.
[time=1895] And yet Jesus spoke more about money than any other subject in all of the New Testament.
[time=1901] You know, if you took all the things Jesus said about heaven and hell, that list wouldn't be as long as a list of things that Jesus said about money and giving.
[time=1909] If you simply took a list of everything that Jesus said about morality and immorality, sex and marriage in the family,
[time=1916] that list would not be as long as what he said about personal financial management.
[time=1922] Yet we are very uncomfortable with that subject for which Jesus was so often a spokesperson.
[time=1930] It's a strange thing, but it is certainly true.
[time=1935] Today I'd like to suggest four reasons why we're often uncomfortable, and then turn in 2 Corinthians 8 to find four biblical principles about giving.
[time=1945] But first, four reasons why many of us are very uncomfortable with the subject of money.
[time=1952] The first is that because many of us are living an un-surrendered life.
[time=1958] Now, some of us have an un-surrendered life in that we've never given our hearts to Christ.
[time=1964] There are many of you that have come here Sunday by Sunday or perhaps watch this telecast, but you've never made a commitment of your life to Christ.
[time=1976] Some of you have been here so long you're comfortable that you pretty much sit in the same row every week in the same chair, and folks pretty much know that's your seed.
[time=1987] But it's not your savior.
[time=1990] Your life is un-surrendered.
[time=1992] So anything that represents an encroachment upon your life is going to be treated as a terrorist
[time=1998] invading your sanctuary.
[time=2002] But what about those of us who have received Christ?
[time=2006] You know, we can still have an un-surrendered life.
[time=2011] Because you see, when we allow Christ to come into our heart as Savior, He takes residence within, but that's a new birth.
[time=2018] It's not called the new finish.
[time=2021] He's not finished.
[time=2023] He's beginning.
[time=2024] And what he's beginning to do is take lordship over increasing areas of our life.
[time=2031] And many of us have never surrendered the lordship of our personal finances to the deity of Christ.
[time=2038] And there's time for a coup d'etat, a holy revolution where we dethrone self and money and elevate Christ.
[time=2049] Money is a strange power.
[time=2053] Too often we think of money as a neutral force.
[time=2058] It is neither good nor evil.
[time=2060] It just is.
[time=2061] And it possesses no intrinsic worth or power of itself.
[time=2064] And that is not true.
[time=2067] There are two key statements of Jesus that teach us the power of money.
[time=2072] For us either to possess it or it to possess us.
[time=2077] The first is found in Matthew chapter 6 verse 24 where Jesus said, "No man can serve two masters.
[time=2083] He will either love this one and despise that one, or he'll cling to this one and hate the other." And he concluded that by saying, "You cannot serve God and Mammon."
[time=2098] Now that word "mammon" is something we hear often enough.
[time=2101] We think we know what it is.
[time=2103] Allow me just a brief history lesson.
[time=2106] In the land of Palestine, three or four languages would have been common.
[time=2110] There would have been the classical Hebrew of the scribes, the Pharisees, and the intelligentsia of the Hebrew community.
[time=2118] But the common man didn't speak that.
[time=2120] He spoke more of a slang called Aramaic.
[time=2125] And then the influence of the Greeks left Koine Greek stamped around the country
[time=2131] and then the Romans came with their Latin.
[time=2134] But the common language, the lingra franco of the people, was this Aramaic, a ground level Hebrew.
[time=2142] And in that language called Aramaic, the word for money is the word "mammon."
[time=2150] Jesus now elevates "mammon" to a position as a rival God.
[time=2161] Jesus views money as the potential to be the single replacement of God in our lives.
[time=2169] And isn't it interesting?
[time=2170] He said that to a very un affluent society.
[time=2173] These weren't people who were transferring their CDs into mutual funds.
[time=2178] These were people who were paid daily and who lived hand to mouth.
[time=2184] And he said, "There is a rival God who is bidding for the throne of your life and many of you have already advocated and surrendered." And that is the God of money.
[time=2196] In a second passage found a little later in Matthew's gospel, we meet an individual who is described as being rich, being young, and being a ruler.
[time=2206] Nowadays we call him the rich young ruler.
[time=2210] This man comes to Christ and Christ says something to him that to my knowledge Jesus never said to another person.
[time=2217] Jesus said to the rich young ruler, "If you would come and follow me then take everything you have, sell it, give it away to the poor, and then come and follow me." Now I know that Jesus demanded of Matthew that he leave his tables and of James, John, and Peter that they leave their nets, but never did he say everything.
[time=2237] Sell it, liquidate it, distribute it to the poor.
[time=2242] Why then do this man?
[time=2245] I think quite obviously because this young rich ruler was a man who did not possess his money, but his money possessed him, and that was the God of his life.
[time=2254] And Jesus was saying, "Until you totally dethron your other God, there is no room for me to sit on the throne of your life."
[time=2264] And so he demanded that he have a totally surrendered life.
[time=2269] In each of our lives there are rival gods.
[time=2272] I must confess to you that the rival God of the life of my youth was swimming.
[time=2281] If the Bible said one thing, the Cowgo Falls High School code said another thing, I went with the coach.
[time=2289] It didn't matter what he demanded.
[time=2291] That was the God of my life, and that's who my served.
[time=2297] A little introspection, please. Who is the God of your life today?
[time=2303] Well, I know many of you have accepted Christ as Savior, but on that throne, who today sits crowned with scepter in hand and movingly dictates your life?
[time=2314] Is it the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=2317] Or is it your financial consultant?
[time=2321] Or is it God? Or is it your personal interest?
[time=2326] Who's in control?
[time=2329] For many of us, when somebody mentions money, it's like a knife going to the very heart of our life.
[time=2336] We have an unsurrendered life.
[time=2338] There's a second possible reason why we feel the squeeze, though.
[time=2341] It's not only the unsurrendered life, it's the unresolved guilt.
[time=2346] Some of you have guilt over how they've gained their money.
[time=2349] More of us have guilt over how we spend our money.
[time=2353] Will Rogers once said this?
[time=2356] He said, "Americans spend money, they haven't earned to buy things they don't want to impress folks they don't like." Isn't that the truth?
[time=2365] Credit cards in hand, we attack the shopping center to buy all kinds of things, because that's what the other folks have.
[time=2372] You don't like those other folks, but we don't want them to think they're one up on us.
[time=2376] So in the force of the American buying power, we say, "Charge." And off we go.
[time=2384] Many of us have great guilt over the way we spend our money.
[time=2388] Tony Campolo tells this story.
[time=2391] Being on the island of Haiti, going into a somewhat nice restaurant, being seated at a table next to the window and being served a very delicious meal, and just as he is about to enjoy the first bite of it, I look through the window and saw two faces of starving Haitians staring at his abundance.
[time=2411] A waiter in the distance saw what was taking place, quickly rushed over and said, "Here, don't worry about that." And he lowered the blinds.
[time=2421] No many of us want to keep the blinds down.
[time=2424] We don't want to see other needs, because that makes us guilty over how we're using what we have.
[time=2431] Still, others of us have unresolved guilt, not only for how we use the money, but how we have mismanaged money.
[time=2440] I've been reading a number of books on finance and have heard other statistics, but do you know that most of us think that by the time we're 65, we will retire on our life savings and be very comfortable?
[time=2451] Statistics show that most of us will be in one of two categories by the time we're 65.
[time=2457] You'll either be in the category of debt or in the category of debt broke.
[time=2463] Most of us spend it all as fast as it comes in, and at age 65, we're in the most precarious position we've ever been in in our life.
[time=2472] We have great guilt for the way we've mismanaged our money.
[time=2475] A third reason why this often creates pressure when someone talks about giving is because there are unsettled conflicts with our mates.
[time=2484] For those of us who are married and we share a home and a checkbook,
[time=2490] that is often the area of marriage that we find it the most difficult to talk about.
[time=2495] There are many couples that can talk about everything in their life, and somebody mentions where's the checkbook, and immediately the air chills as though their freezer door was just opened.
[time=2509] And there's conflict.
[time=2511] He doesn't like how she spends the money.
[time=2517] And there becomes a sense of, "I only did that because you did this." Well, I wouldn't have done that intention.
[time=2525] Accusation, hostilities, because in our marriage we've never solved that problem,
[time=2531] and we've never solved that problem because that problem is the most difficult and challenging in our whole life.
[time=2539] A fourth reason why many of us feel pressure is this one, a lack of clear biblical principles as to how we should give.
[time=2549] Many of us are inundated, I for one, by letters that come through the mail,
[time=2555] and every one of them is a legitimate need.
[time=2558] Every one of them is an urgent need.
[time=2560] I turn on the television set, and the appeals keep coming.
[time=2565] And I don't know where to go, or what to do.
[time=2569] Because each one of them has an ability to make me feel like, if I don't do what they're asking me to do, then the kingdom of Christ will not come.
[time=2579] And we misunderstand all of those fundraising appeals just like my little children misunderstand them.
[time=2586] Rebecca came and said, "Can we have a new baby?" Fear came across my heart.
[time=2595] Psalm 127 says, "Children are in a heritage from the Lord.
[time=2598] Blessed is the man whose quiver is full. There are three holes in my quiver. It is full."
[time=2605] And we tried to explain to this five-year-old that, you know, having children wasn't all that difficult.
[time=2611] I mean, wasn't all that easy. It was, you know, there was a lot involved.
[time=2619] I explained it to a five-year-old.
[time=2622] She explained to me that it was very simple.
[time=2625] You just had to dial 1-800 in the following number, and they would send you one of these babies.
[time=2630] Because she saw a fundraising appeal that if you sent this money, you could adopt this baby who would stay in Mexico, but you would finance it.
[time=2638] It seems so simple to a five-year-old, but raising and financing children is not that simple.
[time=2646] We misunderstand. What is it God wants us to do?
[time=2650] I'd like to share with you four principles from the Bible about giving.
[time=2654] Found in 2 Corinthians chapters 8 and 9.
[time=2659] And if you're fearful today that we're going to preach through these two chapters of 39 verses,
[time=2665] rest assured that the roast will not burn.
[time=2670] 2 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 1, "Moreover, brethren, we make known to you with the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia." How that in a great trial of affliction.
[time=2682] The abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
[time=2687] For to their power I bear witness, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves.
[time=2694] Beceaching us with much in treaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us
[time=2700] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
[time=2703] And this they did not as we had hoped, but first gave themselves to the Lord and unto us by the will of God.
[time=2711] In so much that we besought Titus that as he had begun so, he would also finish in you the same grace also.
[time=2720] Therefore, as ye abound in everything, in faith, in utterance, and in knowledge, and all diligence, and in all love, to us, see to it that you abound in this grace also.
[time=2730] Let me speak not by commandment, but by occasion.
[time=2734] Let me give you from these seven and a half verses, one single principle of which
[time=2740] dozens of good principles could be drawn, but this single principle.
[time=2744] God wants only willing gifts.
[time=2755] It's interesting that this church, the church of Macedonia, of whom it's being reported to the Corinthians, was a church in a paradoxical situation.
[time=2765] Look at verse two it says, how that in a great trial of affliction, things were tough in Macedonia.
[time=2773] And out of that came joy.
[time=2779] He didn't say folks it's tough up in Macedonia and they're really hurting and the joy has been robbed and they're just not going to be able to do anything.
[time=2786] It says, out of their affliction came joy.
[time=2790] And the paradox continues and it says, and out of their affliction, the abundance of joy,
[time=2796] and out of their deep poverty came their generosity.
[time=2802] Here were a group of people who were in a position where giving would be very difficult.
[time=2807] And being sensitive to somebody else's need would be more than they could logically bear because they had their own problems.
[time=2814] And yet listen to their response.
[time=2817] Verse four it says, the Macedonians beseeching us with much in treaty that we would receive the gift.
[time=2826] Paul saying they were made aware of a need and they came to us and said, hey there's got to be something we can do for the saints back in Jerusalem.
[time=2835] And Paul said with much it wasn't as though they casually said, well if there's anything we can do let us know take the phone off the hook quick.
[time=2844] It says they consistently repeatedly wanted to do something.
[time=2850] They were willing.
[time=2852] Look again at verse three.
[time=2854] For to their power I bear witness, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves.
[time=2862] No outside force, no external pressure, no manipulation.
[time=2867] They were willing of themselves.
[time=2870] The last verse we read was the first phrase of verse eight.
[time=2874] It says, I speak not by commandment.
[time=2878] You get me the flavor, God wants only willing gifts.
[time=2887] In this passage the most common word is the word grace which stands in direct opposition to the law of demand.
[time=2894] It says in verse one more over brethren we make known unto you the grace of God.
[time=2899] Verse seven, verse six, finish this same grace also.
[time=2907] Verse seven, see that you abound in this grace also.
[time=2913] The first principle is this, God wants only willing gifts.
[time=2917] It's certainly not my purpose or the purpose of any ministry or program of this church
[time=2923] to ask of you to give anything that's not your heart's desire to give.
[time=2928] That's not what we're after.
[time=2930] It's not what God's after.
[time=2932] He only wants and we like He only look for the willing gift.
[time=2937] When the Tabernacle was built in Exodus and later in the Old Testament the Temple of Solomon was built
[time=2943] both times the offering was taken and said from those who had a willing heart.
[time=2951] Please don't feel any pressure as this church endeavors to grow in the future,
[time=2957] to do anything other than give what you're willing to give.
[time=2963] One of the exciting things that happens is that once we're willing and we begin to pray God creates all kinds of
[time=2971] creative thoughts as to how we can give and how we can do what we really thought we couldn't do.
[time=2977] One of our staff members said this morning, "When is it that you want us to turn our commitments in?" I said, "Well, in the near future," he said, "I'm ready to turn it in now because every time my wife and I talk about it, it goes up." Could I turn it in today?
[time=2990] That's that willing heart.
[time=2992] That's what we're looking for. That's what God's looking for.
[time=2995] We're not asking for you to do anything that you're not willing to do.
[time=2999] Why? Because God's not.
[time=3002] The second principle comes up in these next verses. Verse 8, "I speak not by commandment, but by occasion
[time=3009] of the earnestness of others and to provoke the sincerity of your love." For you know the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor,
[time=3020] that you through his poverty might be rich.
[time=3023] And then this I give my advice.
[time=3025] For this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago.
[time=3033] Now therefore perform the doing of it, that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have.
[time=3044] For if there be first a willing mind, it is acceptable according to that which a man hath, and not according to that which he hath not.
[time=3054] Second principle I'd like to share with you is we not only are invited to give willingly, but secondly we're invited to give consciously.
[time=3062] There's always a temptation when we care about someone, or we care about a ministry, or we care about a program,
[time=3069] to unconsciously, unthinkingly promise to do something that we can't do.
[time=3078] And there's also the opposite danger of saying here comes another fundraising appeal.
[time=3085] And do consciously or unconsciously shut our heart and our mind to it immediately.
[time=3092] Both are equally as wrong.
[time=3095] This passage says we're to give conscious of three things.
[time=3098] First of all in verse 8 it says, "I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the earnestness of others."
[time=3105] Paul's saying here to the Corinthians, "I want to make you conscious of what the Macedonians are doing.
[time=3112] I want you to realize that there are other people who are standing by your side so that together we can stand by the side of the Church of Jerusalem to meet this need."
[time=3122] Now I agree with the concept that the right hand should not know what the left hand is doing.
[time=3127] It's not my business what you give, it's not your business what anybody else, including I give.
[time=3133] But there needs to be a sense that we realize that others are doing something, and that we stimulate each other by the earnestness of one another's commitment in appropriate dignified way.
[time=3149] Secondly, and more importantly, we're to not only be conscious of what others are doing, but we're to be conscious of the Lord Jesus Christ in what He's done.
[time=3158] The next verse, verse 9 says, "You know the grace," that lovely word again.
[time=3163] Of the Lord Jesus who was rich, I mean He had a bigger house in heaven than you'll ever see on earth.
[time=3173] And He had everything in that house that could ever be.
[time=3177] And He had all the help He could ever want.
[time=3181] And He left all of that and He became poor.
[time=3186] You talk about being poor, you go from the biggest house in heaven to a stable in Jerusalem.
[time=3193] That's coming down, folks.
[time=3196] And He who was rich became poor so that we who were poor spiritually might be made rich.
[time=3206] Whenever we think about giving of our time or our money, we need to be conscious of the Lord Jesus and what He's done.
[time=3214] And then finally it's saying here that we need to be conscious of our own resources.
[time=3221] It says here, don't give what you can't give.
[time=3225] Don't say I'm going to make this enormous commitment and then go home and realize that'll be 100% of your salary for the next 13 years.
[time=3233] It says it's not acceptable according to what a man does not have, but what he does have.
[time=3241] We're going to be conscious of what is within our potential to do.
[time=3246] It's not a faithless decision.
[time=3251] It's a decision that includes faith, but it's also a decision that includes wisdom.
[time=3259] Ron Blue in his new and excellent book Mastering Your Money says there are only five things we can do with our money.
[time=3267] It sounds so simple, but I needed to read it to discover this.
[time=3270] It's only five things that you and I can do with money.
[time=3273] The first thing we can do with it is pay our taxes.
[time=3276] And please do. If you don't, I have a jail pass and I'll be glad to come see you.
[time=3281] Second thing you can do with your money is that you can reduce debt.
[time=3286] Third thing you can do with your money is you can give it away.
[time=3290] The fourth thing you can do with your money is that you can save it.
[time=3296] And the final thing you can do with your money is spend it on a lifestyle.
[time=3301] Now, Ron Blue points out in his book that we as Americans immediately go to that fifth option and spend every penny we have on a lifestyle.
[time=3313] Most Americans live very effluently.
[time=3317] They have no money in savings.
[time=3322] And they have no money that they're giving away.
[time=3326] And they do have enormous amounts of money that they all win debt.
[time=3332] And so what they do is they consolidate all those loans into a new debt.
[time=3337] So they can have a little bit of cash to pay the taxes that they should have paid earlier.
[time=3344] And it's our habit to take all that we have, quickly go down those five things, come to spend on a lifestyle, spend it all, and we have nothing for the future and nothing to give.
[time=3356] We are a nation of consumers.
[time=3359] And the reason why we may have a trade deficit may be not because of inferiority of American products over foreign products,
[time=3370] but simply because Americans consume more than the rest of the world combined.
[time=3376] And the only way that we can have all that we want is for the rest of the world to be busy producing it.
[time=3383] When we took a trip to the mission field of which you're aware, we saw thousands of things in Japan that were made in Japan
[time=3391] and the Japanese people never owned any of it. They make it just to sell to us.
[time=3401] We often say I don't have anything to give because we don't have anything to give.
[time=3404] We have so mismanaged our money, we are cash broke, and in debt as far as the creditors will allow us to go.
[time=3414] A third principle is that we give faithfully. Look back again at verse 10.
[time=3420] And this I give my advice, for this is expedient for you, notice this,
[time=3427] who have begun before not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago.
[time=3433] There are three steps that you take. Step number one is a willing heart.
[time=3438] Step number two is a decision to begin to give, and step number three is to follow through and give.
[time=3443] This passage is saying God wants us to give willingly, to give consciously, and to give faithfully.
[time=3449] And by that he says don't say you're willing to do something, make a commitment, and then not be able to live by that commitment.
[time=3456] It's like the man Jesus told about who had two sons. He said to the one, "Come help me in the field."
[time=3462] And the other son said, "No, it's Saturday, cartoons are on. This is a paraphrase." He said, "The other son, come help me in the field." He said, "Dad, as soon as I get my shoes on, I'll be right there."
[time=3472] One who said, "I'm going to watch the cartoons felt bad and went out and helped." One who said, "I'll be right there and never showed up." And Jesus said, "And which son was the father more pleased with?"
[time=3483] Obviously the one who did what he should do, not the one who committed to do it, and then was unfaithful in doing it.
[time=3493] You know, when we failed to pay a debt or to keep a commitment, it often ruins the relationship with that person.
[time=3500] But you know God wants to have a relationship with you today by paying every debt in the blood of his son, Jesus Christ, if you'll hardly see him.
[time=3508] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our church musicians and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3527] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3532] Just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you. Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3538] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3545] Today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me today.
[time=3552] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3556] If you've made a decision, we'd like to have you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3561] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3582] For a set copy of today's message, please write and request take number 1264, or use the sermon title "princibles for giving."
[time=3592] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this take.
