[time=1224] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1235] Thank you, second generation, from the majesty of the orchestra and the bells and the energy of a youth group, there's a call to worship this morning that says that Jesus Christ is alive and it's our greatest desire today to glorify Him and to magnify Him and I want to thank you and welcome you for joining us here today as we celebrate God's grace and a great culmination service that we call just that, a celebration.
[time=1264] We're delighted that each of you are here and to see this large auditorium full this morning and the voices that we have together to praise Him, what a privilege it is.
[time=1273] But there's also the privilege of knowing one another.
[time=1276] Right now, would you simply stand and you're in a unique situation?
[time=1280] There aren't two services.
[time=1281] You don't have your reserve seat at Blackhawk Baptist Church and you're probably surrounded by people you don't know.
[time=1287] Greed at least one person and learned one new name today.
[time=1290] Would you do that?
[time=1291] Let's stand right now.
[time=1293] [ Pause ]
[time=1318] Thank you and you may be seated.

[time=2224] [MUSIC - 81 seconds]
[time=2322] - Good morning to you, I welcome you to our service.
[time=2338] Rick has already done that.
[time=2339] We're glad that you're here.
[time=2341] As you know, when we come here, it's difficult to sing in this building 'cause it's not just reverberant, but you're capable, I know you are, and you're accustomed to singing "How Great Thou Art." So would you stand with me, please, as we sing two stanzas together of "How Great Thou Art."
[time=2365] [MUSIC - 100 seconds]
[time=2480] Would you please remain standing by your heads and hearts before the Lord?
[time=2484] As Pastor Lattman comes to lead us.
[time=2487] God, our Heavenly Father, quite our hearts now
[time=2498] and help us to focus our attention upon You, that one who is all praiseworthy, that one who we've been singing to praise and glory to.
[time=2508] We've come here for a purpose God, and that is to worship a holy, loving,
[time=2514] caring God, one who does provide grace upon grace.
[time=2520] We thank You for the grace You provided to us individually, and to the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and for the grace today, and for the grace in the future.
[time=2530] Thank You, God, for each and every measure of grace that You extend to us,
[time=2537] and I would pray for today that You would just extend that grace to each one here,
[time=2543] that they may sense the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ in their heart, that they may be able to say, "It has been well with my soul."
[time=2553] But yet we understand that there's some here that don't have that personal relationship, and I would pray today that they may have that personal relationship with God's Son, Jesus Christ,
[time=2563] that they would bow their knee and accept Him.
[time=2566] So bless us, our Lord, use it to glorify Your name.
[time=2569] And we praise You, and thank You in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=2574] You may be seated.
[time=2594] Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel, our Father forever and ever.
[time=2599] Dine, O Lord, is the power, and the glory, and the majesty.
[time=2603] For all that is in the heaven and in the earth is dine.
[time=2607] Dine in the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all, both riches and honor come of thee.
[time=2613] And in thine hand, it is to make great and to give strength unto all.
[time=2617] Now there, O Lord, God, we thank thee in praise thy glorious name.
[time=2623] Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[time=2630] Praise him, all creatures, here below.
[time=2637] Praise him, all of thee, and thee go.
[time=2643] Praise, Father, Son, and all thee go.
[time=2651] I will come on the Lord.
[time=2658] Who is worthy to be trained?
[time=2661] Shall I be set?
[time=2663] Shall I be set from my enemies?
[time=2666] The Lord, deliver, and bless to be my rock and look through all of my salvation.
[time=2680] Be it's all dead.
[time=2686] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.
[time=2691] I will sing.
[time=2695] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.
[time=2707] I will sing.
[time=2712] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.
[time=2720] Who is worthy to be trained?
[time=2725] Be it's faithful, as is faithful, as is the mercies of the Lord forever.
[time=2730] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.
[time=2858] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His voice.
[time=2866] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, let the people reach out.
[time=2874] Come to the Father through Jesus the Son, and give Him the glory.
[time=2887] Give Him the glory, give Him the glory.
[time=2895] Praise the Lord.
[time=2921] Thank you, choir.
[time=2922] How exciting.
[time=2923] To God be the glory, great things He has done.
[time=2927] That's our very purpose as a church.
[time=2929] Not only on this special Sunday, but week by week to assemble together, to lift our voices in praise, to say to God be the glory.
[time=2939] The very purpose of our life is to glorify Him, and we hope that that spirit is captured your heart in a unique way on this Sunday morning.
[time=2948] Inside the special bulletin there are a few announcements, and for the brevity of time I would like to share just three with you very quickly.
[time=2956] First of all, if you are looking for your living Christmas teary tickets, Scott Schindler, or one of our volunteers will be in the lobby of this auditorium after we dismiss, and good luck in finding Him in the crowd.
[time=2970] But if you're looking for your ticket, Scott, or one of the volunteers will be in the lobby so that you can pick those up on this morning.
[time=2977] Tonight at six o'clock, not here, back at home in the chapel at Blackhawk,
[time=2983] we'll be having a very important meeting called the Commitment Visitation Training.
[time=2989] We have asked a number of men and women already to meet tonight at six o'clock to be trained for the final phase of celebrating God's grace.
[time=2997] If you haven't been asked and you would like to be a part of that training, please feel invited officially, as of right now, to join us at six o'clock in our chapel.
[time=3007] If you're not sure what commitment visitation training is all about and you have a nervous bone in your body, just come tonight and observe and I'm sure you'll be excited and enthusiastic just as I have been as I've been a part of the advanced training and commitment times.
[time=3023] That's at six o'clock tonight, and because everything that we own is down here at the Grand Wayne, and every piece of talent, music, little and otherwise that we have we're using this morning, and because of that important meeting at six o'clock, we'll not be having a regular service tonight.
[time=3039] So if you feel like you're getting shorted today, come for the training at six o'clock. David Norton has been the chairman of Celebrating God's Grace. He's done a marvelous job.
[time=3051] He's been a friend for many years, and I couldn't have asked for a better friend than Dave Norton to lead this program and ray train to be the chairman of our Board of Deacons and to have the staff that we have here at Church to serve the Lord. David's going to introduce our steering committee to you and the people who have worked with them.
[time=3071] Thank you, Pastor. It's been a privilege, and as I said here and watch all of you come in and I listen to the choir and to the orchestra, you know, we're no greater than the sum of our parts.
[time=3083] Not any one person is more significant than another we each sometimes have a more upfront opportunity than others do, but we're only as great as the sum of our parts.
[time=3095] And I've been privileged to, frankly, to have two co-chairmen. I've been the spokesperson, but I haven't been the real thrust behind this, and I wanted you to meet them. Frankly, what they've become, they've become co-partners in prayer. We've been meeting weekly for prayer, and Dr. Ken Castor is one of our co-chairmen. Ken, would you stand? And under Ken's responsibility, I'm going to introduce the chairman, and then of those that are associated with that particular area of the steering committee's work, if they would stand with their chairman. But Ken made a comment last week. He says, "I'd like this not to end because we've developed a relationship and a kindred spirit that's gone beyond Celebrate God's Grace." And I suspect that Ken, and our other co-chairmen, and Rick and I will probably continue that because God is so often the case, gives us more when we're involved than when we're on the perimeter.
[time=3147] Ken's responsibilities and his co-labors are Griggs, who is our information director. Jeff, where are you located?
[time=3155] There's Jeff. He's the one that's been responsible for all the brochures, the writing, the printing. And one of those kind of fellows that said, "Jeff, we better get," and he says, "I know you're looking for this." And they just had it all ready for us. Thanks so much for a good job. Those associated in Jeff's committee, would you please stand? We want to take it and then collectively we'll let you see the power behind this. Jeff, you had some more people, where are they?
[time=3179] We didn't do all of this yourself. "Oh, they're already standing. They're behind me," he says.
[time=3183] Serving in more than one capacity. Then we had Gary Layman.
[time=3187] I refer to him as Bulldog Layman.
[time=3191] He was our advanced commitment chairman, and what a perfect guy, because what he demonstrated was commitment.
[time=3199] And that's what it takes. And Gary, with his own life, does that, so it was not hard for Gary to get a meaningful group of people to follow and like kinder? Are there those besides the choir that are out there that were a part of Gary's group, and would you stand? Part of the advanced commitment we had, we have, "I know we have you out there. I saw you. I worked with you." They must be embarrassed. They did a good job, and we're grateful for that. And then one that's not here I know is Elsie Saylor. Elsie is a lady who has made all of the refreshments, who has made it difficult for me to retain a diet that I'm supposed to be on, and retain a weight that I'd like to maintain. And Elsie has Jack, who just faithfully brought refreshments for every meal and continues to do that. Elsie is visiting family in the east. And I must admit, Elsie told me, last week as we walked out the door, that there was a lady that she had assigned to her job while she was gone. "I don't know who you are. I've forgotten your name, but would you please call me this afternoon because I've got some work for you to do, and I don't know who to talk to." And then the responsibility for all of this along with our music pastor Kobi is Ron Hackett. Ron, where are you? In the back, guiding and directing, thank you so much. Are there any others that were out there with your group Ron that have helped besides those in the choir, would you please stand?
[time=3287] I think we're all intimidated with all of the family here in one place, but we're grateful. And then our other co-chairman, I could pick, you know, you pick your prayer partners out.
[time=3299] When I looked in the crowd today, I immediately saw Dr. Kaster because he's been part of my heart, and my other co-chairman has been Brad Moore over here. I picked him out, but I picked him out for a couple of reasons. I'm going to dress like I feel today. I'm going to dress for a celebration, and that he did. And Cole Labering with Brad was Chuck Nelson, who was in charge of our home visits.
[time=3319] Chuck, where are you? There's Chuck Nelson off to your left.
[time=3323] He was on the bubble right up front. He didn't have any time to worry or fret. We got right after Chuck at the very beginning and all of this, and some of you received visits. Some of you didn't, but we're sorry, and Chuck tried, and I know that his heart was that he would visit every family that was a part of this church or desire to visit.
[time=3343] Thank you, Chuck. And then Linda Banner, the secretary who's in the arts and work just kind of flowed through the entire organization. Linda, where are you?
[time=3355] Linda's to the back, and the only thing that I guess if I were to give Linda a title, it would be servant. Thank you.
[time=3363] And then Bill Bodecker, who will all be watching on our regular basis, Bill is hopefully that the early parts of this campaign go well because these are three-year follow-up chairman, and he says, "David, I'm going to be right after you for 36 months, so don't let up." Bill Bodecker, Bill's at the back, ushering.
[time=3379] Isn't it neat that most of the men that I'm naming are also serving in other parts of the church?
[time=3383] They have that kind of a heart. And then last, and a man that I was privileged to meet early on into this church and was a part of the beginning families, the founding families, is Bob Mishler who's in charge of our commitment visits which will begin after this evening. And I would like if they would, and please do this, this is important. I want the church family and the friends of Black Hawk to see. All of those who were at the meeting for training last week stand up, along with all of those who intend to come tonight as well as the rest of Bob Mishler's commitment visit committee. Would you please stand right now? All of you.
[time=3419] And those in the choir, would you raise your hands?
[time=3423] I want the rest of the church, if I stay remain standing, if you will, I want the rest of the church family to look around because these are the people that will be visiting you in the next few days.
[time=3435] And I want you to know that they're not there to coerce you, embarrass you. They're not there to convince you to do something or to change your mind about doing something more.
[time=3447] Their whole purpose is to go and to receive what God has already laid on your heart. And I would like more than anything else tonight.
[time=3455] You can see the size of this group and you can see the size of the family that's remaining seated. You can make our jobs a whole lot easier if just a few more of you would come tonight and we could break the task down into more chewable bites. And now I would like to ask one more thing, are there any others that have had the part of Celebrate God's Grace? Behind the scenes, the technicians, would you please stand as well? Wives, husbands that are in the congregation, and anyone else that has had a part, any part of the campaign, would you please stand at this point?
[time=3487] Would you all stand at one time now?
[time=3491] Yeah, each are getting a little more courage.
[time=3497] Anyone else? It does take a lot of people.
[time=3501] And we're grateful. And I would like now for the rest of you if you will stand and we'll have a prayer for our morning offering. And I would like in a fashion to challenge the people that will be going for the commitment visit or commitment visits this week and the following week along with you who would love to have help us.
[time=3521] I'm reminded of a quote I saw this morning in my quiet time by Oswald Chambers. He said, "The test of the life of a saint is not success, but faithfulness.
[time=3533] Faithfulness in human life as it actually is." And well, I think that's what God is calling us to do.
[time=3537] Not live life in some fantasy or in some manipulated circumstances that we feel pressure, but he wants us to live life in a faithful manner where we are daily. Let's pray.
[time=3549] Father of all of the people who have experienced and seen your grace certainly we of Blackhawk have in these last several years.
[time=3561] We've been beaten down. We've been forced at points to look up Father, but we've never given up because we have a great God upon whom which we relied and who we know depends our success.
[time=3573] Father, I would just this morning would like to dedicate the men and women to youth that have already participated in Celebrate God's Grace, and I would like to extend that commitment to those now that will be going out and doing their part in this important program.
[time=3589] Father, I would like to pray for those hearts that are wavering.
[time=3593] Why are they not the ought to come tonight to help the fear?
[time=3597] Father, we're not going out in these days ahead to sell anything. We're going out to share what the Savior's already given us and ask us to be stewards of it. We're not owners of it, Father. We are just stewards of it. I would like to Father bless the visitors and the families that have been a part of this and will continue to be a part of it. Father, I would trust that we would be empowered and in field commissioned, each one of us in these days ahead, are your Holy Spirit. And as we give yet on a daily basis that offering that is needed for the continuation of what we're already responsible for this morning, Father. We do that out of hearts that are giving with joy and giving with a sense of sacrifice for a Father and His Son who gave us a sacrifice that can never be matched, eternal life.
[time=3649] And it's in that Savior and that Father's matchless name that I pray.
[time=3653] [AMEN]
