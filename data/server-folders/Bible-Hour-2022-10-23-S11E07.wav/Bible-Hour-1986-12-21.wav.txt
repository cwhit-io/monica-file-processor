[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] A recent article described the high cost of Christmas.
[time=76] It said that we spend November buying the gifts, December enjoying them, and then January moaning over the bills.
[time=86] Many of us spend a great deal of our savings on Christmas.
[time=90] And too many of us spend our future on credit cards to purchase gifts for Christmas.
[time=96] But the highest cost of Christmas was paid centuries ago by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=102] And many of us have not yet discovered how the gift that was purchased by that high cost of Christmas can be ours.
[time=120] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=127] We're glad you've chosen to spend part of your day with us.
[time=130] The high cost of Christmas is the title of Rick's message today, and comes from 2 Corinthians 8, where the scripture says, "The Lord Jesus, though he was rich, yet for your sakes became poor." Today's study is designed to draw our attention this Christmas to the Lord Jesus.
[time=147] He is the reason for the season.
[time=150] So that you are able to study with us, please locate your Bible, and have it open to 2 Corinthians 8. We'll be looking at verse 9.
[time=158] Today's special music will be provided by the living Christmas tree choir, the children's choir, the handbell choir, and for joys.
[time=173] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=179] and can be seated on this station each week at this time.
[time=183] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=188] Now here's Rick.
[time=190] Thanks for joining us now for the Bible hour.
[time=193] We've come today to worship Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the light of the world,
[time=199] the one whom Isaiah called the everlasting light.
[time=203] But he's not only a distant light, he's a light that you can know personally, that you can receive, that he can give your eternal life and a new life today, as though the light of a million mornings can be your heart.
[time=237] Then in my darkest hour, you touched me with your power,
[time=250] and when I looked, your light was everywhere.
[time=260] The light of a million mornings filled my heart,
[time=272] the sound of a million angels sent my songs.
[time=283] The warmth of a love so tender touched my light and said it more.
[time=297] The light of a million mornings dawned in me.
[time=314] I never tried to understand the sunrise.
[time=324] I only know it takes away the dawn.
[time=335] I can't explain your healing, or all the joy I'm feeling.
[time=345] I only know you've come into my heart.
[time=355] The light of a million mornings filled my heart.
[time=366] The sound of a million angels sent my songs.
[time=377] The love so tender touched my light and said it more.
[time=389] The light of a million mornings dawned in me.
[time=402] And though that your glory has come shining through,
[time=412] it might be a candlelight that shines for you.
[time=422] The light of a million ago.
[time=432] The light of a million days filled my heart.
[time=446] The love of a million angels sent my songs.
[time=457] The love so tender touched my light and said it more.
[time=470] The light of a million mornings.
[time=477] The light of a million days filled my heart.
[time=490] The light of a million mornings.
[time=497] The light of a million days filled my heart.
[time=532] What a magnificent sound that's going to be when we join with the angels in eternity and sing songs like the light of a million mornings.
[time=540] While angels from the realms of glory are still singing praises to our Lord, let's join them again as we sing Him number 108.
[time=548] Angels from the realms of glory will sing the first and second stanzas together 108.
[time=578] Angels from the realms of glory are still singing praises to our Lord, let's join them again as we sing.
[time=595] Shall you give me the light of a million months for you, for I am ready to bow beside you.
[time=609] Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[time=628] We've had a tremendous blessing each evening presenting the living Christmas tree.
[time=633] We are grateful for the many musicians, ushers and other people who have been so helpful during this time and we want to thank you for that.
[time=641] It's indeed a privilege to sing the songs that represent the birth of our Savior and the light of the world, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=650] That can be done in many different ways and as we sing about the third song into the living Christmas tree, the children come down the aisle and somehow around the base of the tree it just lights up a little more
[time=662] because of the beauty of those children and their glorious voices.
[time=666] Well, we put them all together and there's a great number of young people, your children, that are going to tell the Christmas story this morning.
[time=674] So let's listen as Kathy Hawks and Wade Holbrook and all of our children sing that famous Christmas story about our Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=703] It's almost story time. Everyone come in and find a seat and we'll begin.
[time=733] Tell it once again how Jesus Christ was born one night to light the hearts of men.
[time=753] Well, this is a story about the very first Christmas gift ever given and it all began long ago and far away in a little desert town called Bethlehem.
[time=783] Joseph was a carpenter, a simple man but strong. He and his young wife Mary traveled a long way to get to Bethlehem.
[time=791] They were going there to pay their taxes. It had been a very hard trip for them both but especially for Mary because she was going to have a baby.
[time=800] Most of trying to find a comfortable place for them to sleep in Bethlehem but the town was so crowded that night the only place he could find was a stable.
[time=810] You mean like a barn and they were going to have a baby? Well, what happened next?
[time=817] Well, that night Mary had a baby boy and they named him Jesus. Jesus. Yes, Jesus. And he was a very special baby. The most special baby ever because he is God's own son.
[time=847] The day down his feet and the stars in the sky, the down where he lay, the little Lord Jesus must be on the chest.
[time=867] In nearby fields some shepherds were watching their sheep and suddenly the sky was filled with angels and the poor shepherds were just terrified but the angels told them not to be afraid for they had wonderful news and it was about the baby.
[time=886] That's right. The angels were singing about the birth of the newborn king.
[time=899] The world was so well. The angels did say a search in poor shepherds and fields where they lay.
[time=913] If he is heavy, if he is their sheep are a momentous life that was some king.
[time=927] Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, or is some king of his fire.
[time=944] Once the shepherds heard the news that God's own son had been born in Bethlehem, they rushed to see him and they were praising God all the way.
[time=955] The world, the Lord, has come, let earth be seen for peace, let every God be buried in blue, let heaven be true, see, let heaven be true, see.
[time=979] Three kings from the east had also received God's good news about the birth of his son. They followed a bright star for many miles until they reached a place where the Christ child laid.
[time=993] Three kings of warrior talks, varying history travels so far, healed and loved, adored and loved, and followed by the star.
[time=1008] Oh, star, one of the star of light, the star of royal beauty, bright, the last for thee, still for thee, died as you, that earthly father.
[time=1025] And all who had heard and all who believed came to the cradle of the newborn king and they worshipped him.
[time=1040] Oh, Lord, ye name of joyful and triumphant, oh, come ye, oh, come ye to enter him.
[time=1058] Come, let me hold him, Lord, the king of angels, oh, come, let us adore him, oh, come, let us adore him.
[time=1082] Come, let us adore him, let us adore him, let us adore him, let us adore him.
[time=1094] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1105] So that's the ancient story, all about how this great big God sent this little baby Jesus to the earth to be his present to them.
[time=1115] Well, I'm sure he was probably a mighty cute little baby boy, who sure got a lot of cute kids running around this place today.
[time=1123] But comfort, tell me this, why would such a big God, if he was going to give a gift to this earth, why did he just send him a little baby?
[time=1133] Oh, don't you see, Jesus wasn't an ordinary baby?
[time=1137] He wasn't.
[time=1138] No, he wasn't. You see, when God sent Jesus to earth, he was really sending himself.
[time=1145] I don't get it.
[time=1147] Well, let me see, how can I say it?
[time=1150] When God sent Jesus, he put all of his love and joy and peace into that little baby, and then he sent him here to earth for you and me.
[time=1159] Well, for all of us, see what happened that very first Christmas is that God sent us a savior, a king, a best friend.
[time=1170] And that's the reason we celebrate.

[time=2119] - Thank you, ladies.
[time=2121] And if you have your Bibles with you today, would you open them to study with us from 2 Corinthians and the 8th chapter, and we'll look at one verse today, verse 9.
[time=2134] A great deal has been written and said on the news about the high cost of Christmas.
[time=2140] One person said, "We spend all of November buying the gifts, all of December enjoying them, and all of January moaning over the bills." Christmas can be very expensive.
[time=2154] Gifts are amazing.
[time=2157] Some of the baby dolls, believe it or not, cost over $100.
[time=2164] But then, of course, that baby doll talks to you.
[time=2168] We've been trying to get our children to talk a little less.
[time=2171] I don't know why we would buy one more of the talks.
[time=2175] Christmas is becoming expensive.
[time=2178] The high cost of Christmas.
[time=2180] But with all the gifts that are given and purchased, all the prices that are paid, of course, the greatest price was paid by the Lord Jesus Christ centuries ago.
[time=2193] We're told of that.
[time=2194] In 2 Corinthians, chapter 8 and verse 9, it says, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[time=2203] that though He was rich, yet for your sakes, He became poor, that you, through His poverty,
[time=2214] might be rich." That's the greatest price of Christmas.
[time=2222] That the Lord Jesus Christ, who was rich, became poor so that we who were poor could become rich.
[time=2231] It's a divine transaction that only God could put together.
[time=2237] Now, if you'll notice it says, "The Lord Jesus Christ, though He was rich," that's telling us something first of all about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2246] It's telling us that Jesus Christ existed before He was ever born at Bethlehem.
[time=2252] The verb tense tells us that.
[time=2254] He was rich before He entered the world and at that point became poor.
[time=2260] This Jesus who was born in Bethlehem whose birthday we celebrate was the pre-existent God who lived in eternity past and who chose
[time=2271] of his own volition to enter humanity as the baby Jesus through
[time=2277] Mary in the city of Bethlehem.
[time=2280] And why did He do that?
[time=2282] It was out of His grace.
[time=2284] That word is one of the most consistent words of all the New Testament.
[time=2290] You know the grace of our Lord Jesus.
[time=2293] Grace is a judicious term.
[time=2296] It speaks of favor that is given that is undeserved.
[time=2301] It's a gift and more.
[time=2304] It's not a gift that's given in the gift exchange where I think you're going to give me a gift, so I'm going to run out and give you a gift so that when you give me my gift I can say, "Here's your gift." That's a merited gift.
[time=2318] It's an exchange.
[time=2320] Grace speaks of an unmerited gift.
[time=2323] Someone who doesn't deserve it has nothing to give back in exchange, who hasn't earned it but receives a gift.
[time=2335] That is the spirit of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2338] His grace caused him when he was rich to become poor.
[time=2345] When we speak of the riches of Christ we could go on forever talking about all of the riches of Christ.
[time=2354] Please allow me to suggest these three for you today though.
[time=2358] One of Christ's first riches, perhaps foremost above all others, was that in heaven before he came to earth he had an intimate, involved relationship with God the Father.
[time=2374] I don't know how you are with your children, but most of the time I really enjoy mine.
[time=2380] Now there are few opportunities that I would give them away, but not most of the time.
[time=2387] And to be separated from them for any length of time is one of the hardest things you'll ever experience.
[time=2396] At least it is for Kathy and I.
[time=2399] Back in March we were on a missions trip and gone for almost three weeks and the kids were between grandparents most of the time.
[time=2407] They had a delightful time.
[time=2408] We missed them and they missed us.
[time=2411] But it was never more graphically than when we had picked them up.
[time=2415] We had hugged and kissed and done all those "I miss you" type things.
[time=2418] We're now at Grandma's house and we're ready to leave to come back to Fort Wayne.
[time=2422] The girls hop in the back of the station wagon.
[time=2425] Kathy buckles Adam in the back seat and starts to get in the front seat and he grabs us.
[time=2431] You ride here with me and points to the back seat.
[time=2435] So here I am driving from Akron, Ohio.
[time=2438] Two little girls in the back of the station wagon.
[time=2441] Kathy and Adam in the middle and the chauffeur driving them home.
[time=2445] But there was a relationship there.
[time=2448] Between a mother and a son.
[time=2452] It was intimate.
[time=2454] Several years ago a family that was very dear to us in this church went through a tragic situation.
[time=2462] We received the phone call while we were at home visiting our parents.
[time=2467] Kathy and I were both deeply hurt by this tragedy.
[time=2470] We were crying.
[time=2472] Rebecca was two and a half at the time.
[time=2474] She sized up the situation, walked into the bedroom and pulled out her bunny blanket.
[time=2481] Walked over and handed it to Kathy and to me.
[time=2487] And this look was, see, everything's going to be all right.
[time=2491] You can have my bunny blanket.
[time=2494] You know, there are some intimate moments of parenting.
[time=2497] There's a relationship between a mother or a father and a son or a daughter that can't be rivaled anywhere.
[time=2508] And as strong as our relationships are here, they are nothing
[time=2514] compared to the eternal relationship between God the father and God the son.
[time=2522] That was the first of the great riches of Christ.
[time=2527] His eternal relationship with God the father.
[time=2531] A second one of his riches that I would like to suggest was his home in heaven.
[time=2536] The Bible tells us a great deal about heaven.
[time=2539] However, the heaven it tells us a great deal about is not the one that existed then or now.
[time=2545] Most of the heaven we read about in the book of Revelation is a future heaven.
[time=2549] The scripture teaches us that heaven and earth will pass away and that God will make a new heaven and a new earth.
[time=2557] But what little we know about heaven only causes our mind to race with speculation of how marvelous it would be.
[time=2567] Now let's face it, who wouldn't like to have a host of 10 or 12,000 angels waiting to take care of everything you needed.
[time=2576] I could adjust to that.
[time=2579] That was heaven.
[time=2581] Christ was in his glory.
[time=2582] He was recognized as God and the merians of angels were there praising him and serving him.
[time=2591] That's quite a place to be.
[time=2593] That was one of the riches that Christ possessed.
[time=2596] And then this third one was he had the proper identification as
[time=2602] the Son of God.
[time=2604] He was in the terms of Jesse Jackson, somebody.
[time=2608] He was God and God the Son.
[time=2612] And so when the scripture says that you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he were rich, think of a thousand things but at least think of these three.
[time=2623] That he had an intimate relationship with his father.
[time=2627] He had a home in heaven and a clear identification as the Son of God.
[time=2634] However the passage reads on.
[time=2637] It says though he were rich, yet for your sakes he became poor.
[time=2648] Jesus gave up all of those three things.
[time=2651] He gave up his relationship with the father.
[time=2654] He left heaven and he entered the world no longer as the Son of God but as the Son of man.
[time=2661] When you speak of poverty perhaps Jesus was unequaled.
[time=2666] When he was born he had to borrow a feeding trough from a cow for his first cradle.
[time=2673] He had to borrow some rags from a stall for his first clothing.
[time=2678] He had to borrow of earthly father to teach him a borrowed trade.
[time=2683] Later in life he had to borrow lunch from a young lad so that he could feed himself and his friends.
[time=2692] He had to borrow money from a fish to pay his taxes.
[time=2699] He had to borrow a donkey to ride into Jerusalem.
[time=2704] He had to borrow a tomb in which to be laid.
[time=2708] But that made good sense because he wasn't staying long.
[time=2713] Someone said reverently we could say that Jesus was one of the greatest scrounges of history.
[time=2719] He never owned anything except for what he borrowed.
[time=2724] He was physically as poor as a person could be socially the same.
[time=2733] In Philippians chapter two verse five it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God and now notice this phrase and made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant.
[time=2757] Jesus became a social enigma.
[time=2763] A person known Graziada.
[time=2766] He had no status.
[time=2768] He had no recognition.
[time=2770] He became of no reputation.
[time=2773] Let's picture the globe in the time in which Christ was born and let's point out the major cities.
[time=2781] Of course you would start with Rome.
[time=2783] All roads led to Rome and it was the capital of the world.
[time=2786] But equally as significant would be Athens.
[time=2790] Athens was the school of the world.
[time=2793] Though the Romans conquered the Greeks militarily the Greeks conquered the Romans in philosophy.
[time=2801] There was Alexandria the largest library in the world.
[time=2805] The scholars would meet there as well.
[time=2811] Then there was Bethlehem.
[time=2814] Bethlehem made nobody's map.
[time=2818] The people who lived in Jerusalem just a Sabbath's journey away.
[time=2825] Might not have even known about Bethlehem.
[time=2831] And he was born son of Mary and Joseph of Nazareth.
[time=2838] When people talked about Nazareth they said can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
[time=2846] He was a nobody.
[time=2848] Socially he was an outcast.
[time=2850] As a matter of fact his whole birth was suspect.
[time=2855] I mean after all they're not even married and she's pregnant.
[time=2858] No wonder they came to a new city.
[time=2861] Maybe no one would know.
[time=2864] The Romans was socially as poor as poor could be.
[time=2868] He was born into the most despised race on earth at that time.
[time=2873] Though they were God's chosen people the world rejected the Jewish nation.
[time=2880] The Romans mocked them the Egyptians hated them.
[time=2884] Their enemies surrounded them.
[time=2887] To be born an illegitimate Jew was socially impoverished as a soul could be.
[time=2897] Jesus was poor emotionally.
[time=2900] Oh not that he didn't have his emotions in check and balance.
[time=2904] But he was not constantly reinforced by well-wishers.
[time=2908] Padded on the back.
[time=2909] Most of the time when we see Jesus he's an anguish and often in tears.
[time=2915] A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief is how Isaiah described him.
[time=2923] And spiritually poor again.
[time=2930] He was physically removed from the presence of his father and then ultimately on the cross he would cry out.
[time=2936] My God my God.
[time=2940] Why hast thou forsaken me?
[time=2944] And spiritually he was reduced to our level of total poverty.
[time=2953] It says though he were rich yet for our sakes he became poor.
[time=2958] So that.
[time=2960] All of this had a purpose.
[time=2962] This wasn't a tragedy.
[time=2964] The Greeks loved to write about tragedies.
[time=2966] To them the hero was the victim.
[time=2970] It was the man who was caught in the trap such as Oedipus who faded, dictated this and chance had taken over.
[time=2979] And life is reduced to purposelessness.
[time=2982] That is not the story of Christmas.
[time=2985] The story of Christmas is yes Christ was rich and yes he became poor.
[time=2990] But all of that was a part of God's purpose so that we through his poverty might be made rich.
[time=3003] We were certainly poor in the very ways that Jesus was rich.
[time=3008] We had no relationship with God.
[time=3010] We had no home in heaven and we had no identification as the children of God.
[time=3019] We were spiritually as poor as poor could be.
[time=3022] As a matter of fact the Bible describes us in Romans chapter 5 in three ways.
[time=3027] It says that while we were yet sinners, that's the first description, Christ died for us.
[time=3035] God's view and assessment of us is that spiritually we're sinners.
[time=3039] Secondly it goes on to describe us as ungodly.
[time=3044] We were not only without God but we were ungodlike.
[time=3049] And finally in verse 10 it describes us in the most harsh but honest of terms.
[time=3055] It says that we were God's enemies.
[time=3060] We were the poor ones.
[time=3062] But Christ died to make us rich.
[time=3065] And the very way he made us rich is the exact same way he became poor.
[time=3072] And the same way he became poor was the riches he gave up.
[time=3077] First of all Christ was rich.
[time=3080] He had a relationship with the Father.
[time=3082] He became poor.
[time=3083] He gave up that relationship with the Father so that we who were poor who had no relationship with the Father might be rich and have a relationship with the Father.
[time=3094] In Ephesians chapter 2 it describes the relationship of all humanity and God as aliens.
[time=3102] Strangers separated from God.
[time=3105] It's as though God's over here Paul said all of humanity over there.
[time=3109] And there's a huge wall in between.
[time=3112] We are separated from God.
[time=3115] But Jesus Christ broke down that middle wall of partition so that we can have a relationship with God.
[time=3122] A relationship Paul said whereby we call him Abba Father.
[time=3127] That's Aramaic.
[time=3128] That little word Abba is a term of endearment.
[time=3131] We all have different names that we call our parents or children call us.
[time=3137] Dad, Father.
[time=3140] But this word Abba, maybe it's best described as daddy.
[time=3145] Intimate, clear and direct.
[time=3149] Christ gave up his relationship with the Father so that we through him could have a relationship with God that would be otherwise absolutely impossible.
[time=3164] Secondly Christ was rich.
[time=3167] He had a home in heaven.
[time=3169] He became poor.
[time=3170] He gave up that home in heaven so that we who were poor having no home in heaven might be rich having a mansion there.
[time=3178] Jesus said in my father's house there are many mansions.
[time=3182] If that weren't so I would have told you.
[time=3185] He said I'm going to prepare a place for you.
[time=3188] And when I go I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you might be also.
[time=3196] Thomas was the skeptic in the group and he said Lord you keep looking up.
[time=3201] We have no idea where you're going.
[time=3204] How do you expect us to know the way?
[time=3207] And Jesus said I am.
[time=3210] The way, the truth and the life.
[time=3214] No one comes to the Father but by me.
[time=3218] But through Jesus becoming poor we now have not only the opportunity for a relationship with God but we also have a home in heaven if we will come through the way of Christ by receiving him as our Savior.
[time=3236] And as our Lord.
[time=3238] The hymn writer put it this way.
[time=3241] Out of his ivory palaces into a world of woe my Savior's deepest love made him to go.
[time=3257] Jesus gave up his home in heaven to purchase a home in heaven for each of us.
[time=3265] Finally Jesus gave up his title Son of God.
[time=3270] He was rich, he was a somebody, he was the Son of God.
[time=3274] He gave that up became the Son of man so that we who were poor the sons and daughters of men might be called the children of God.
[time=3286] Vance Habner was one of the great preachers of all time.
[time=3289] He just died recently.
[time=3292] I heard him speak when I was a seminary student back in 1977 and Jimmy Carter was president.
[time=3300] Vance Habner said I have been called a lot of things in life, a lot of them I would like to give back.
[time=3306] But he said there is one thing that I have been called that I never will give back and that is the name Son of God.
[time=3313] And then Habner said him even being president of the United States why that is just peanuts compared to being the Son of God.
[time=3323] And in John chapter 1 verse 11 it says Jesus came unto his own but his own would not have anything to do with him.
[time=3333] They would not receive him but to as many as who do receive him to them he gave the power to become the children of God.
[time=3344] You today can become one of God's sons or more appropriately for your gender one of God's daughters.
[time=3352] God wants to adopt you into his family.
[time=3356] As a matter of fact the word in scripture adoption is simply a compound of two other words, the word son and the word to make, adoption means to make a son.
[time=3365] God wants to make you one of his sons, one of his daughters.
[time=3371] Christ became poor. He gave up a relationship with the Father that we could have a relationship with the Father.
[time=3377] He gave up a home in heaven that we could have a home in heaven.
[time=3381] He gave up the title son of God and became the son of man so that we might have the title sons and daughters of God.
[time=3392] Someone has written these majestic words under the title the incomparable Christ.
[time=3399] He was born contrary to the laws of nature. Lived in poverty was reared in obscurity and only once crossed the boundary of the land and childhood.
[time=3411] He had no wealth or influence. He had neither training nor education in the world's schools.
[time=3419] His relatives were inconspicuous and uninfluential.
[time=3424] In infancy he startled a king. In boyhood he puzzled the learned doctors.
[time=3431] In manhood he rolled the course of nature. He walked upon the billows and he hushed the sea to sleep.
[time=3438] He healed the multitudes without medicine and never made a charge for his services.
[time=3444] He never wrote a book. Yet all the libraries of the country could not hold the books that have been written about him.
[time=3451] He never wrote a song. Yet he has furnished the theme for more songs than all the songwriters together.
[time=3458] He never founded a college. Yet all the schools together cannot boast of as many students as he has.
[time=3466] He has never practiced medicine but he has healed more broken hearts than the doctors broken bones.
[time=3478] This has been an inspiring morning as we've shared with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, the children's choir, the handbell choir and rejoice.
[time=3487] Also the inspiring message from our Pastor Rick Hawks I hope was a challenge for you.
