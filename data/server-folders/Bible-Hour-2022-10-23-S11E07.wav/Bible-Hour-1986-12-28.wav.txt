[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] During the Roman Empire, the Emperor had some of his most select warriors for the battlefield and for the arena.
[time=114] They had a song that went like this.
[time=117] We, the wrestlers, wrestle for the O emperor to win for thee the victory and from thee the crown.
[time=125] During the days of the Roman Empire, a number of those prime soldiers came to Christ.
[time=131] And in order, went out from the Emperor that any soldier who professed Christ had to die.
[time=136] In the battlefield of Gaul, which we now call France, this nation called his men together and asked if there were any who professed Christ.
[time=146] Forty of those key soldiers stepped forward.
[time=149] He gave them till sundown to renounce Christ.
[time=152] And at sundown he asked them again, "How many professed Christ?" And all forty of them claimed the Lord.
[time=159] Not wanting any of the Roman soldiers to have to put their own comrades to death, he sent them naked onto the frozen lake of France.
[time=169] And there they perished in the cold.
[time=172] But as they were dying, they sang this song.
[time=176] Forty wrestlers wrestling for thee O Christ to win for thee the victory and earn for thee the crown.
[time=186] As the first one died, they began to sing.
[time=190] Thirty-nine wrestlers wrestling for thee O Christ to win for thee the victory to win from thee the crown.
[time=198] The Roman soldier who was to guard them.
[time=202] Sitting by a fire a few hundred yards away could hear the number change from forty to thirty.
[time=207] And he was so moved by their commitment to Christ.
[time=210] When he saw their commitment, he knew Christ had to be real.
[time=214] And he jumped off, tore off his clothes and yelled, "No, no, not thirty-nine, but forty.
[time=221] Forty wrestlers wrestling for thee O Christ to win for thee the victory and to earn from thee the crown."
[time=233] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=246] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=248] Today, Rick's message is taken from 1st Corinthians chapter 15 and is entitled Resurrection Living.
[time=255] If Jesus is dead, we are of all men most miserable.
[time=259] It was Paul's reasoning.
[time=261] On the other hand, if Christ is risen, that is motivation for conversion, commitment and character.
[time=267] This is our study for today.
[time=269] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1st Corinthians chapter 15.
[time=274] We will be looking at verses 29 through 34.
[time=278] Today we will be hearing special music from our own Steve and Maria Gardner and Crystal Hall.
[time=287] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=294] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=297] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=301] The greeting of our celebration this morning.
[time=305] Welcome to the Black Hawk Baptist Church and to you friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=310] We welcome you today.
[time=312] We've come this morning to worship Jesus Christ, who is not only the child born at Christmas, but he's the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and we've come to worship him today.
[time=323] Thank you for being a part of this service.
[time=325] We have from our own church some dear friends who are traveling most of the year, but home on this special holiday, Stephen Maria Gardner, who are ministering to us in music, and we're delighted that they're home and we have this opportunity to have them as a part of our morning worship service.
[time=341] And we're equally delighted that each of you are here to join in the celebration of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=359] Angels, we have heard on high, sweetly singing all the flames,
[time=368] and the mountains in reply, echoing their joyous sing with us, will you?
[time=377] Gloria, In a celsius day, oh, Gloria, In a celsius day, oh, Gloria,
[time=406] Shepherds, why this jubilee, why your joyous strains prolong,
[time=415] But the gladsome tidings be, which inspire your heavenly song, Gloria,
[time=433] In a celsius day, oh, Gloria, In a celsius day, oh,
[time=454] That's good singing. Those of you who are at home, we don't want you to be left out.
[time=458] Next time we come to the chorus, you join the folks here at church and sing with us, will you?
[time=462] Come to Bethlehem and see Him who is worth the angels sing.
[time=474] Come our door unbended me, Christ the Lord the new, all together now.
[time=485] Gloria, In a celsius day, oh, Gloria, In a celsius day, oh,
[time=514] That's great to be back home, and in spite of the holidays and people gone on vacation
[time=531] to see so many people here this morning, to see so many friends whom we have missed, we're glad that you're back, we're glad that we're back.
[time=540] It's a traditional old Christmas carol that we seldom get to hear except during these days around Christmas.
[time=546] The story of wise men and a shepherd and an angel said the night went to the little lamb.
[time=555] Do you see what I see?
[time=560] We're up in the sky, little lamb. Do you see what I see?
[time=569] A star, a star dancing in the night, with a tail as big as a kite, with a tail as big as a kite?
[time=585] Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy. Do you hear what I hear?
[time=595] Bringing through the sky shepherd boy. Do you hear what I hear?
[time=604] A song, a song high above the trees, with a voice as big as the sea, with a voice as big as the sea.
[time=623] Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king. Do you know what I know?
[time=633] In your palace war mighty king. Do you know what I know?
[time=642] A child, a child shivers in the cold. Let us bring him silver and gold.
[time=651] Let us bring him silver and gold. Said the king to the people everywhere.
[time=662] Listen to what I sing, pray for peace people everywhere.
[time=671] Listen to what I sing, the child, the child sleeping in the night.
[time=681] He will bring us goodness and light. He will bring us goodness.
[time=691] And light.
[time=706] [APPLAUSE]
[time=713] This is our last opportunity for one year to stand in front of the living Christmas tree.
[time=718] It came and went so quickly, it's even hard for those of us who were here for all 14 to believe they are over.
[time=725] Rick, it just seems like we anticipated and it comes so quickly and goes, but we had a wonderful year this year and it's just a delight to look at the tree and just realize the number of lives that were affected by the music in the ministry of the living Christmas tree.
[time=739] Well, that has been exciting, but the hard work comes tomorrow, doesn't it?
[time=743] We tear down tomorrow, if there's anybody that's interested in coming, we will have an all-day project of putting everything back into the trailer and stored for another year.
[time=751] You know, excitement seems to build as the tree is building, but coming down just isn't quite that exciting.
[time=757] Somehow there are more donuts left over when we tear down than when we put it together.
[time=762] It has been a joy to share the Lord Jesus through the living Christmas tree with you friends who have joined us these last two Sundays by way of television.
[time=771] Today we will not be using the living Christmas tree musically, but we have our special friends, Steve Maria Gardner with us today.
[time=778] Rick, Steve and Maria have been very busy, but we're just delighted that they're a part of our program today.
[time=783] They travel full-time as a music ministry and they've been out of the state of Indiana the entire four months of this fall and early winter season, but it's a delight again to welcome them.
[time=794] We always enjoy their ministry and I know that all of you that are watching enjoy the ministry of Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=800] They'll be back to sing for us in just a few moments.
[time=803] Right now I would like to introduce you to a pamphlet that I believe can be of tremendous help to each one of us in the growth and development of our spiritual lives.
[time=812] It's a booklet on discovering principles to determine God's will for our life.
[time=818] The scriptures make it very clear that God's will is first of all for us to know Christ as Savior.
[time=824] Secondly, Jesus said he that would do his will, meaning God's will, should know the scriptures studying God's word is his will for our lives.
[time=834] But then there are some decisions that we have to make every day about careers, marriages, decisions of financial planning, relationships that perhaps we're not quite sure what God's will would be.
[time=846] And how do you know that?
[time=847] Here's a booklet that can help called principles for decision making and the will of God.
[time=853] We would love to send you a copy if you would simply write to us today.
[time=857] If you write to us right to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=865] Once again, the address is the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=874] Pete, we have two special events coming up in our calendar.
[time=878] The first one is next Sunday morning with the life action singers.
[time=881] Yes, Rick, we've invited life action singers from Buchanan, Michigan to be with us for an all day event.
[time=887] They'll be singing in our morning services next Sunday, and then they will put on a drama on the life of the family, a very important drama concerning the family and how it can stay together and encouraging one another to just live those kinds of lives that will keep our families together.
[time=903] I think it'll be a very enjoyable time for everyone.
[time=906] Well, that's next Sunday, January, brand new year, January the 4th.
[time=911] Life action singers will be with us musically and the morning, and then they'll be with us for a dramatization in the evening service at 6 o'clock.
[time=919] We invite any of you that don't go to church or don't have an evening service to come and join us and visit Blackhawk Baptist Church at that time.
[time=927] On the last weekend of January, January the 30th and 31st, we're having a special seminar here at Blackhawk called a Walk Through the Bible Seminar.
[time=937] It's on Friday night, January the 30th, and Saturday morning, January the 31st.
[time=943] In this seminar, you'll be exposed to the entire Old Testament in a dramatic yet educational way so that at the end of the seminar, everyone who participates will have about a 95 to 100% remembrance of the major themes of the Old Testament.
[time=961] Although I've been to seminary and have graduated with a three-year degree, I don't know of anything that can put, for my mind, the Bible together more concisely than the Walk Through the Bible Seminar.
[time=974] It's available to the public and we want to ask you to reserve that date Friday night and Saturday morning, January the 30th and 31st.
[time=982] Over the next few weeks, we'll give you details how you can register.
[time=986] Before we go back to our morning worship service, I want to thank all of you who have prayed for and supported the Bible Hour in this past year.
[time=994] Many of you have received a letter from us concerning our need for new television equipment, and if you have, we want to thank those of you who have responded.
[time=1002] Those of you who are still thinking about it, we encourage you to decide quickly.
[time=1006] This is our last Sunday of the year, and it's important that if you're going to give and receive the advantage tax-wise, that you postmark your letter and your gift to us before this year's end.
[time=1017] Again, thank you for joining us today. As we go back to our morning worship service, we're trusting that God will use this hour to build your life spiritually.
[time=1029] Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf and stubborn, then shall the layman lay person hurt, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing.
[time=1059] [MUSIC]
[time=1083] For he shall feed his flock like a shear, and he shall learn the land with his own.
[time=1110] [MUSIC]
[time=1123] For he shall feed his flock like a shear, and he shall gather the land with his own.
[time=1152] [MUSIC]
[time=1164] And carry him in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young, and gently lead those.
[time=1193] And gently lead those that are with young.
[time=1213] And carry him in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.
[time=1242] And gently lead those that are with young.
[time=1268] [MUSIC]
[time=1298] On the hay of a manger bed, Mary laid her beautiful baby boy. So much had happened in such a short time. The words of the angel, her marriage to Joseph, the journey to Bethlehem, and finally, at last, the birth of her son Jesus. Just the sound of his name caused her heart to rejoice.
[time=1323] There's a silent celebration in this heart of mine. It's like a gentle lullaby I see.
[time=1339] And as I look with quiet wonder at my sleeping child, I know that he is born to be a king.
[time=1360] There's a silent celebration only God can see, for he understands the mystery that I own.
[time=1374] That an angel spoke my name, and told a prophecy. And tonight my love can touch what he foretold.
[time=1388] A silent celebration for a sleeping child. The lips that long to sing, Hosanna, only wear a quiet smile. And there is simply now to speak his name.
[time=1408] How lovely Jesus is. His name speaks peace to me.
[time=1430] There's a silent celebration of a miracle. Just to think that God would let me have a heart.
[time=1444] When he placed his might and power in a little child, he placed a silent celebration in this heart.
[time=1459] There's a silent celebration in my heart.
[time=1490] Joseph too was filled with wonder as he held the child in his arms for the first time. He had really worried about this moment.
[time=1499] How could he be the father to God's son? And yet as he looked at the child at night and held him closely, his heart was flooded with an incredible sense of peace.
[time=1515] His name speaks peace to me so softly and tenderly.
[time=1533] And the worries inside of me seems to be when his name speaks peace to me.
[time=1576] His name speaks peace to me so softly and tenderly.
[time=1596] The worries inside of me seems to be when his name speaks peace to me.
[time=1624] When his name speaks peace to me.
[time=1664] Jesus Christ entered this earth in a scene of glory with angels singing. And he left this earth when we think of the crucifixion in quite a different scene.
[time=1677] Yet we know that he is returning again and that more than anything else of God's creation, more than any other way in which God has revealed himself to us.
[time=1686] He has revealed his glory through Jesus Christ, his son who is the Shekinah glory of God.
[time=1696] Jesus, the image of the father come to save us.
[time=1705] Jesus, the holy one of Zion come to earth, reflecting God's own light.
[time=1717] He is the brightness of his father's eye.
[time=1722] He is the splendor of Shekinah glory.
[time=1729] The fullness of God was made flesh in his son, Shekinah glory.
[time=1738] Now we can see the invisible one.
[time=1744] The ancient of day worthy of praise Shekinah glory.
[time=1756] The image and brightness of God wrapped in his son.
[time=1770] In days gone by God revealed his love in many ways, his love to show.
[time=1779] By miracles and prophets words he showed us who he was.
[time=1789] But in these last days he has revealed to us his secret plan so we can understand the temple could not hold his glory.
[time=1811] Neither could the tablets made of stone nor the precious mighty arch of the covenant.
[time=1828] They were mere reflections of the story to unfold.
[time=1837] Shekinah glory.
[time=1841] How we're in majesty worthy is Christ.
[time=1847] Shekinah glory.
[time=1850] Create harmless Zion soon coming here.
[time=1863] The obedient son.
[time=1865] Shekinah glory.
[time=1869] How we're in majesty worthy is the Lord.
[time=1877] Shekinah glory.
[time=1888] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1898] Thank you, Steve Maria.
[time=1900] The child that was born was the king of kings and he is the Shekinah glory of the Lord and we've come to worship him.
[time=1909] We've gone today from the quiet tenderness of he will feed his lambs as crystal would sing it to the majesty of the king of kings and the Shekinah glory.
[time=1920] And it's the same Christ who tenderly offers to feed us and who ultimately will reign over us.
[time=1927] And the privileges are of knowing him, whom they know as eternal life.
[time=1932] We're delighted that each of you are here to be a part of this worship service this morning.
[time=1938] Let's just take a moment in the midst of the formality to be in form on to greet one another and say hello to those who are around you.
[time=1945] If you don't know somebody introduce them by name and greet one another this morning.
[time=1950] Let's stand and do that now.
[time=1953] [background noise]
[time=1978] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1980] [background noise] We're delighted again that each of you are here with us this morning.
[time=1989] We've come to worship God, to know him, and to know his power in our lives.
[time=1996] Let's look to him in prayer.
[time=1999] God, before we open up our Bibles, we first open up our hearts to you, and we today would want to hear a message not just from another speaker, but a message that rises out of your word and is directed by your spirit.
[time=2016] We would ask you to speak to every heart, including mine, with the diversity of needs God made you uniquely meet each one.
[time=2026] We would pray today for those who are discouraged that a word of encouragement would fill their cup today.
[time=2034] We would pray for those who are physically not well, that you would strengthen them.
[time=2038] We pray for Dr. Ken Cole and Manila, that you would give strength to his body and use them in a unique way in these days when there's so much political unrest to bring spiritual rest.
[time=2051] Father, we would pray this morning for Peter Davis, that your hand would be upon his young body and give his body the ability to fight this infection.
[time=2062] We'd pray for Ed and Marsha as they take care of their little baby, that you would give the doctor's wisdom to control these seizures.
[time=2070] We'd pray for Jack Beebe this morning, that you would aid him in his recovery.
[time=2075] Father, we would pray today for those whose hearts are heavy.
[time=2080] They've lost loved ones, and this holiday season brings back the lingering memory of death.
[time=2087] You would comfort them, even though they'd be adults that you would cradle them in your arms.
[time=2095] And as Steve and Maria sang, you would give peace.
[time=2099] Father, we'd pray for young men and women who today are living in a fast lane.
[time=2105] Some of them have already found the consequences.
[time=2108] Others feel that they can beat the odds, that you would draw them to yourself.
[time=2114] Father, we would pray today for senior adults, some very lonely, some financially insecure, but many of them spiritually in need of Christ.
[time=2125] We pray that you would speak to them.
[time=2128] Let no one think because of their years that there's not time to change, not time to receive Christ.
[time=2135] Whom to know is eternal life. Amen.
[time=2141] The Apostle James was arrested.
[time=2144] And according to Fox's book of martyrs, he was such a godly man, there was no charge on which they could hold him.
[time=2152] So like the Lord Jesus, James was arrested under false accusation.
[time=2157] A scoundrel was found who would falsely accuse James and then he would be held.
[time=2164] James, however, was given the opportunity to secure his release and to gain back his life, only one requirement.
[time=2172] That he renounced Christ and pledged not to speak anymore in his name.
[time=2178] James could do neither.
[time=2181] He was taken to a point of public execution and again given the opportunity of life and of freedom and he professed Christ even more boldly.
[time=2190] He was put to death. He was beheaded.
[time=2194] In the crowd that watched this public execution was a man.
[time=2198] A man very familiar with the setting, for he had helped perpetrate it.
[time=2203] It was the scoundrel who had falsely accused James, the pond in the hand of the Romans.
[time=2209] And he was so convicted when this man, James was willing to die that he reasoned that Christ must be alive because no one would die unless they truly believed that the cause for which they were giving their life was real.
[time=2231] And that scoundrel, when he saw James's death, not only reasoned in his heart that Christ was real, but he believed on him and gave public faith in Christ.
[time=2243] And in turn was executed himself.
[time=2246] What motivates people to be converted? What motivates people to be committed to Christ, to live for him daily, even in these cases to die?
[time=2261] Turn with me, if you will, to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and the 29th verse.
[time=2267] For those of you who are a part of our church week by week, you know we've been studying through 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=2273] We're working our way through this great book of the Bible.
[time=2276] And today we're reading chapter 15 verses 29 through 34.
[time=2285] Now, else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all?
[time=2295] Why are they then baptized for the dead? And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
[time=2303] I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=2309] I die daily.
[time=2313] After the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me if the dead rise not?
[time=2325] Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die.
[time=2330] Be not deceived.
[time=2332] Evil communications corrupt good manners.
[time=2337] Oh, wait to righteousness and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God.
[time=2345] I speak this to your shame.
[time=2348] Here the Apostle Paul speaks about the motivating power of the resurrection of Christ.
[time=2354] Throughout this entire chapter he's arguing rhetorically with some real people.
[time=2360] Some naturalists in the Greek world they would have been called atheists perhaps and in the Hebrew world Sadducees.
[time=2369] Those who denied the resurrection, both the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the resurrection of any who die.
[time=2376] They taught that when you die it's over.
[time=2381] But now the Apostle Paul speaks about the resurrection of Christ as a motivation for conversion, for commitment and for character.
[time=2390] Verse 29 may be one of the most difficult verses in all of the New Testament to understand.
[time=2397] One particular commentator cites 34 different interpretations of this passage.
[time=2403] I'm not going to pretend today that I've got him all figured out and I'm here to tell you the 35th one which beyond the shadow of a doubt is correct.
[time=2412] We cannot be dogmatic about what this verse means, but I am certain that we can be dogmatic about what it does not mean.
[time=2420] Let me read verse 29 again, this time in the new international version.
[time=2425] Now if there is no resurrection what will those do are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all then why are people baptized for them?
[time=2436] Let me tell you what this verse does not mean.
[time=2439] Centuries ago there was a man by the name of Marcian who taught that if I died, well apart from Christ I would go to the grave bodily into the pit of hell spiritually and there I would be in hell because I never receive Christ as Savior.
[time=2459] But while I'm suffering down in hell suppose a friend of mine Jim Pearson goes down to the chapel and he's baptized for Rick Hawks.
[time=2473] According to Marcian Jim's baptism for me would get me out of hell and into heaven because he was being a living man baptized for a dead man me and now I would be spiritually relieved of my sins and sent to heaven.
[time=2487] That's not only an ancient belief of a man by the name of Marcian, there are numbers of people that believe today that someone living can be baptized for someone who's dead and release them from hell.
[time=2499] A number of groups believe that.
[time=2502] The Mormons in particular teach that that's why they're so involved with genealogies because they want to know who their ancestors are so that they can be baptized for them and release them.
[time=2514] Raised Edmond says that he has met a woman who has been baptized hundreds of times for family members in such notable personalities as George Washington and Julius Caesar.
[time=2528] Now how can I be dogmatic and say that's not what this verse means because I must confess to you a simple reading of that would lead you to believe that people were being baptized for dead and that was somehow bringing them spiritual life.
[time=2543] Well again this is one of the most unclear passages of scripture, no one debates that.
[time=2549] A good rule of biblical interpretation is to take what you do know and use that to interpret what you don't know.
[time=2558] Verse 29 is what we don't know but let's talk about two things that we do know.
[time=2564] First thing that we know that's abundantly clear in scripture is that baptism doesn't save anyone.
[time=2572] The Bible teaches that the only thing that saves us is our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that we've got to be born again into the family of God.
[time=2581] Baptism of course is important but it's not essential and it's certainly not saving.
[time=2587] So if baptism doesn't save anyone it's living it's illogical to say it's going to save someone who's dead.
[time=2594] And if baptism can't save Jim who's getting baptized how on earth is it going to save me who's not on earth?
[time=2604] Second thing the Bible teaches that's very clear is no one can be saved by proxy.
[time=2609] Every year at this time most of us hear from the banks with which we do business.
[time=2614] The board of directors are asking our right to vote in our behalf by proxy.
[time=2620] Proxy simply means that I relinquish my rights to someone else who will now act in my behalf.
[time=2629] I cannot be saved for any of you nor can any of you be saved for me or the person next to you.
[time=2638] The Bible says whosoever will call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but it's reflexive.
[time=2645] That means it refers back to the person themselves.
[time=2650] You see the Bible is so clear first that baptism saves no one and secondly no one can be saved for anyone else so it's impossible then to believe that baptism by one person can save another person.
[time=2665] Well then what does this passage mean?
[time=2668] Well allow me to read this list of 34 interpretations.
[time=2671] No I won't do that this morning.
[time=2674] Let me just suggest to you one that I believe is the best.
[time=2679] I believe what this is saying is exactly what happened in the life and death of James.
[time=2686] That when a believer in Christ died for Christ and an unbeliever saw the power of that testimony they often came to Christ and were baptized into the church to take the place of that fallen Christian soldier.
[time=2706] And in the tradition of the early church there are some records of people who had come to Christ, been baptized publicly and publicly shared how someone's death influenced them to Christ and they were now coming to Christ in that person's place to serve the Lord.
[time=2729] I believe the Bible is here saying that the resurrection of Christ is so real that it was one of the major motivations for people being converted and coming to know Christ as their Savior.
[time=2744] In his excellent commentary on 1 Corinthians John MacArthur tells of this historical event.
[time=2751] In the war between Finland and Russia seven Russian soldiers were taken captive, none of them believers.
[time=2759] They were captive and to be executed the next morning.
[time=2763] On the eve of their execution one of the men was contemplating his own fate.
[time=2768] And as he did that memories of his childhood and the teachings of his mother came very clearly to his mind.
[time=2776] He recalled verses that he was forced to memorize as a youth.
[time=2780] They came back to his mind and led him to make a recommitment of his life to Christ.
[time=2786] And a song came back to his mind that he began to sing.
[time=2790] They came safe in the arms of Jesus and throughout the night he led those other captives and singing safe in the arms of Jesus.
[time=2800] The next morning they were led to be executed and they were requested their wish to sing one final time that him safe in the arms of Jesus.
[time=2812] At least one of the other Russian soldiers came to Christ during the night.
[time=2818] In addition the Finnish officer in charge said what happened in the hearts of the others I don't know.
[time=2827] But I was a new man from that hour.
[time=2830] I had met Christ in one of his loveliest and yet youngest disciples.
[time=2837] And I had seen enough to realize that I now could be his.
[time=2843] You see the resurrection of Christ is the greatest motivation to be converted to the Lord Jesus.
[time=2851] Because if he is alive then that forces us to live in view of eternity and to be converted and to follow Christ.
[time=2862] In the next verses he talks about the resurrection of Christ not only is the motivation for conversion but the motivation for commitment.
[time=2871] Now Paul speaks about his own life.
[time=2874] He describes a number of events that have taken place in his life.
[time=2879] In verse 30 he says this.
[time=2885] And as for us why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
[time=2892] The King James Bible says why stand we in jeopardy every hour.
[time=2896] Paul was not involved in any game shows.
[time=2899] When he was talking about being involved in jeopardy he was talking about his life being threatened repeatedly.
[time=2907] Back in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 Paul gives a partial list of what he meant when he said I'm in jeopardy every hour.
[time=2917] Verse 23 says this.
[time=2921] Are they servants of Christ?
[time=2923] Am I out of my mind to talk like this?
[time=2926] I am more.
[time=2928] I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, been exposed to death again and again.
[time=2938] Five times I received from the Jews 40 lashes minus one.
[time=2944] Three times I was beaten with rods.
[time=2947] Once I was stoned.
[time=2949] Three times I was shipwrecked.
[time=2951] I spent a night and a day in the open sea I have been constantly on the move.
[time=2957] I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from gentiles, in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea, and in danger from false brothers.
[time=2976] Paul wasn't speaking euphemistically. He wasn't exaggerating when he said that he stood in jeopardy constantly.
[time=2984] When 2 Corinthians was written it was fairly early in Paul's ministry.
[time=2989] He had not been arrested in Jerusalem.
[time=2991] He had not been tried by Festus or Felix or Agrippa.
[time=2994] He had not made his voyage to Rome on which he was shipwrecked again.
[time=2998] Snake bitten.
[time=3001] Paul said why on earth would I do all this?
[time=3005] One reason, because Jesus Christ is alive and that motivates him to be committed to suffering and to service.
[time=3015] Then he gives a second event.
[time=3018] He says I die daily.
[time=3020] Now as often as Paul was beaten shipwreck and otherwise threatened physically, it wasn't every day that he was nearly put to death.
[time=3029] I think when he said I die daily he was referring to a different death, that he was dying to himself.
[time=3036] That like everyone of us, Paul fought a daily battle between the old man and the new man.
[time=3042] The new nature and the old nature for whom would he live for himself or for Christ.
[time=3048] And he had to go through the experience that every one of us are called to and that is the daily die to ourselves.
[time=3055] But Paul said why on earth would a man die to himself and not just live for himself?
[time=3060] Because Jesus Christ is alive, the resurrection.
[time=3063] It motivated him to serve us.
[time=3066] Then he gave a third event.
[time=3069] He said that he fought against wild beasts in Ephesus.
[time=3072] We have no other historical record other than this passing comment.
[time=3076] But apparently Paul was exposed to wild animals and his life was threatened.
[time=3083] And he said what profit is there?
[time=3086] What advantage is there for me if when you die you die and it's over?
[time=3095] Paul says the only reason why men would live as I has lived is because Jesus Christ is alive and he gives resurrection life.
[time=3106] Paul said if that's not true then we ought to just eat and drink, be merry because tomorrow we die.
[time=3115] Oh it may not be tomorrow December the 29th.
[time=3118] It may be next year on December the 29th but we're going to die and we might as well live it up while we've got life.
[time=3125] The first time that famous statement eat drink for tomorrow we die is found in recorded history.
[time=3131] It's probably in the Old Testament, Isaiah 22.
[time=3134] Where God called Israel to repent and they would not.
[time=3139] And God said I'm going to send judgment on you and you're all going to die tomorrow.
[time=3144] And instead of mourning and repenting they said well if we're going to die tomorrow this is our last chance we better live it up today.
[time=3155] That thought was picked up by the Greeks and what we now call hedonistic philosophy started in a colony of North Africa, Greek colony by the name of Cyrene.
[time=3167] The inhabitants and the philosophy were called the philosophy of the serenaics.
[time=3172] It started by a man by the name of Aristipas who taught that the ethic of life was pleasure that man ought to seek pleasure.
[time=3181] He was greatly influenced by Pythagoras who was a naturalist.
[time=3185] Pythagoras taught the only thing that you can know are the things that you can know through your own senses.
[time=3190] There's not any God or any revelation you only know what you experience and you want to experience pleasure.
[time=3197] It was taken even further by a man by the name of Theodorus who was also called the atheist.
[time=3203] Theodorus said theft, adultery, sacrilege are all fine as long as you can escape the penalties.
[time=3211] It's like the modern statement anything is okay as long as you don't get caught.
[time=3216] Live for your own pleasure.
[time=3219] Paul was putting in sharp contrast that you either live your life for Christ and say because he's alive it's worth living for him or your mind will become a total hedonist and says I live for my own pleasure.
[time=3231] Whatever my appetite dictates that's what I'll take.
[time=3237] Paul said why would I suffer the way I've suffered only one reason because Jesus Christ is alive and that motivated him to be committed.
[time=3249] Finally he says it's also motivation for character.
[time=3254] Do not be misled verse 33. Bad company corrupts good character.
[time=3261] Mark Twain said ten years from today you'll be exactly the same person you are today except for two things.
[time=3267] The books that you read and the people that you meet.
[time=3271] If Mark Twain lived in our area he would have said ten years from today you'll be exactly what you are today except for three things.
[time=3278] The books that you read the people you meet and the television you watch.
[time=3283] Your good character can so easily be corrupted by bad company.
[time=3291] Paul was saying separate your life out from the hedonists from the unbelievers and surround yourselves by godly people because Mark Twain was right.
[time=3302] You're going to be exactly what you are today with the only difference being tomorrow the influence that other people have on your life.
[time=3312] That's why it's so important that we're very selective about our friends and the younger we are the more important it is that we're selective.
[time=3319] There's no one who owes more influence in the life of a teenager than their friends.
[time=3325] So if you're a teenager today by the friends you choose you're going to shape your own character.
[time=3330] You choose good friends you're going to shape a character that's godly.
[time=3334] You choose corrupt friends they're going to corrupt you.
[time=3338] But that's not only true of adolescence that's true of adulthood.
[time=3344] It's important that we shape our character and the resurrection of Christ is the motivator to do that.
[time=3353] Motivate us to be converted to Christ.
[time=3356] Motivate us to be committed to him and to motivate us to shaping good character.
[time=3364] Psalm one once is blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly nor does he stand in the way of sinners nor does he sit in the seat of the scornful.
[time=3375] But his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night.
[time=3382] He will be like a tree planted by rivers of water that brings forth its fruit in its season.
[time=3388] And whatsoever he does will prosper.
