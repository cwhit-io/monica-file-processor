[time=0] circumstances that we feel pressure, but he wants us to live life in a faithful manner where we are daily. Let's pray. Father of all of the people who have
[time=14] experienced and seen your grace, certainly we have Blackhawk have in these last several years. We've been beaten down, we've been forced at points to look up
[time=25] father, but we've never given up because we have a great God upon whom which we relied and who we know depends our success. And Father, I would just this
[time=36] morning would like to dedicate the men and women to youth that have already participated in Celebrate God's Grace and I would like to extend that commitment to those now that will be going out and doing their part in this important program. Father, I would like to pray for those hearts that are wavering. Where they're not the ought to come tonight to help the fear. Father, we're not going
[time=59] out in these days ahead to sell anything. We're going out to share what the Savior's already given us and ask us to be stewards of it. We're not owners of it, Father, we are just stewards of it. I would like to Father bless the visitors
[time=74] and the families that have been a part of this and will continue to be a part of it. Father, I would trust that we would be empowered and in field commissioned each one of us in these days ahead by your Holy Spirit. And as we give yet on a
[time=88] daily basis that offering that is needed for the continuation of what we're already responsible for this morning Father, we do that out of hearts that are giving with joy and giving with a sense of sacrifice for a Father and His Son who
[time=104] gave us a sacrifice that can never be matched eternal life. And it's in that Savior and that Father's matchless name that I pray. Amen.
[time=139] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=268] The last two or three days I've been at the praise gathering in Indianapolis and really got my heart fulfilled. Just before I left though I went to value city and I looked for a red tie. The best I could do was kind of a rose color and I realized now why they were out of red tie. So Dell Rogers has a red tie on, Rick has a red tie on, David Norton has a red tie on and several of you in the audience. This is the best I could do. The time that we had together down there
[time=296] was really refreshing and one of the speakers got up and he after some of the music and he just said wow and I want to say that backwards. Wow. And that's the
[time=307] way I feel about having been down there and getting my heart so full with speakers and music and anticipating this morning with all the bells starting out so beautifully and our orchestra coming along so well and the special groups second-generation singing for the first time and our choir being so faithful. I'm grateful. This is one area where we've got to have people just as a visitation and in this campaign. People have to join together. We've been singing a chorus from Sunday after Sunday celebrate God's grace. It's at the bottom of your program. Do you know that sing along? We're going to sing it twice and I hope that you know it well enough to just sing right out. Celebrate God's grace.
[time=368] Celebrate God's grace. Celebrate God's grace. Celebrate God's grace. Celebrate God's grace.
[time=417] Celebrate God's grace. Celebrate God's grace.
[time=467] Celebrate God's grace. Celebrate God's grace. Celebrate God's grace. Celebrate God's grace.
[time=494] Celebrate God's grace.
[time=514] I post none of words nor tell of good deeds.
[time=524] O not have I done to bear it is grace.
[time=534] O glory and praise shall rest upon Him.
[time=544] So will it in time in my place.
[time=553] I will glory in the cross in the cross.
[time=593] My trophies and crowns my robe stained with sin was all that I had to lay at his feet
[time=614] unworthy to read from the table of life to own the tradition for me.
[time=634] I will glory in the cross in the cross.
[time=644] Let me suffer in all being made.
[time=655] I will weep no more for the cross that he wore.
[time=664] I will glory in the cross in the cross.
[time=674] I will weep no more for the cross that he wore.
[time=685] I will glory in the cross.
[time=706] Thank you men singers I hope you have your Bible with you and if you do please turn in
[time=718] it now to Hebrews chapter 12 and verses 1 and 2.
[time=726] In Hebrews chapter 12 the writer is using an analogy between the Christian life and the
[time=734] world of athletics that's a great illustration for the American mind because we are inundated
[time=741] with sports and with television.
[time=745] One lady kissed her husband on the first day of September and said honey I've sure enjoyed this and all look forward to seeing you after the Super Bowl.
[time=753] I hope you have a great fall.
[time=756] We love sports in our culture and I believe athletics can teach us some great insights
[time=762] about life and God obviously thinks that way too because he uses athletics in several
[time=768] key passages of the scriptures.
[time=771] First Corinthians chapter 9 it talks about a runner.
[time=776] Philippians chapter 3 it talks about a runner.
[time=779] First Corinthians chapter 9 it talks about a boxer, a fighter, a wrestler and here in
[time=785] Hebrews chapter 12 once again a runner.
[time=788] That reads like this in the King James Bible, wherefore seeing we also are compassed about,
[time=796] surrounded if you will with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[time=806] and the sin that so easily besets us and let us run with patience the race that is set
[time=817] before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that
[time=825] was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand
[time=835] of the throne of God.
[time=839] I would like to take from this passage four principles that rise out of athletics that God wants us to apply to our lives as believers in Christ.
[time=850] Just as the athlete trains conditions and peaks for one event we as a believing body
[time=858] of Christians have been trained and we have been peaked for this one event that we have gathered here today to celebrate.
[time=868] These four principles I believe are principles that need to mark us day by day as individual believers and these are four principles that need to govern the decisions that you and I will make as families as it relates to celebrate God's grace.
[time=882] Now for some of you you've heard principles one and four because we shared those upstairs three weeks ago in the ballroom at our advanced commitment reception but let me share those four principles with you again.
[time=895] Now before I get into the four principles though I need to explain one thing.
[time=901] Many of you have been a black hawk for a number of years and know a little of my background others of you do not know.
[time=907] I spent my high school years in the field of competitive swimming.
[time=912] Now I'm going to use some things I learned as a competitive swimmer to illustrate these points but I need to explain something to you first of all.
[time=920] From time to time you hear speakers like Bill Glass who was an all pro defensive end for
[time=927] the Cleveland Browns and a spokesperson for Christ.
[time=930] The man who led me to Christ David Burnham was a four time all American at Wheaton College
[time=936] and drafted by the Washington Redskins.
[time=940] Some guys are all pro and other guys are all American.
[time=944] Now when it came to swimming I was not all pro.
[time=949] I was not all American.
[time=952] I was not all state of Ohio.
[time=955] I was not all Cowell Falls High School.
[time=958] The only all that I was in swimming was all wet and that didn't amount to very much.
[time=963] My coach said to me at the end of my junior year he said hawks you are an amazing swimmer.
[time=968] As a matter of fact you're the only swimmer I know it can swim in three gears slow stop
[time=974] and sink and he shared with me that there weren't a lot of college scholarships available
[time=980] with those credentials.
[time=983] All that's to say please don't get enamored with the illustrations.
[time=985] It was bush leg at best but four principles.
[time=990] Principle number one is this remember you're a part of a team.
[time=998] Various sports take place as individuals and others as a part of a team.
[time=1003] If you're a golfer once you get your grip and your swing down and you make the circuit you really only represent yourself.
[time=1010] You're not a part of a team you're an individual.
[time=1014] If you're a part of a track team but you're a simple individual man you throw the shot putter of the disc or you throw the javelin and keep the audience alert.
[time=1025] Or if you're a 100 yard dash man but never a part of a relay you only win or lose for yourself.
[time=1032] But if you're a part of a football team or a basketball team or you're on a swim team you're part of a relay if you're on a track team and you're part of the 400 relay then you represent more than just yourself you represent others who are part of that team.
[time=1048] So if you win you win not only for you you win for that relay team and if you lose you
[time=1055] not only lose for yourself but you lose for the others who are on that relay team.
[time=1062] Now if you look at the first word of Hebrews chapter 12 it's the word wherefore at risking
[time=1069] offending our English teachers who are here today.
[time=1071] I believe that word is a conjunction.
[time=1075] Words like wherefore therefore and but are conjunctions they're trying to tie what has
[time=1082] already been said with that which is about to be said.
[time=1086] Now we've already read what follows the wherefore but what we haven't done is look at what preceded it.
[time=1092] Now remember this when God inspired his word he inspired it as one narrative the book of Hebrews it wasn't until later that chapters and verses were inserted.
[time=1102] So Hebrews chapter 11 actually flows straight into chapter 12 there's no real break there.
[time=1109] Someone has correctly identified Hebrews chapter 11 as God's Hall of Fame and as you look back
[time=1116] at Hebrews chapter 11 verse 7 it says "By faith Noah being warned of God of things not
[time=1124] seen as yet moved with fear." In verse 8 it says "By faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receiving inheritance obeyed not knowing where he went."
[time=1139] Verse 9 "By faith he sojourned." Verse 20 "By faith Isaac." Verse 21 "By faith Jacob." Verse 22 "By faith Joseph" verse 23 "By faith Moses when he was born was hidden by faith
[time=1155] verse 24 Moses." Then you come down to verse 35 "And women received their dead raised to life again and
[time=1165] others." I believe what the writer of Hebrews wants us to see is that God has always had a people.
[time=1175] Someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=1182] What is being pictured here is that God took Noah and out of all humanity he raised Noah
[time=1188] up to be a single spokesperson and Noah like a relay runner ran his life serving God and
[time=1197] at the end of his life God had another person or another group of people and Noah simply stretched out his arm at the end of his life and placed the baton into the hand of the next generation and they ran and God called an Abraham and Abraham ran with his life
[time=1214] and he took the baton at the end of his life and he placed it into the hand of his son Isaac and Isaac lived for God and at the end of his life Isaac would give the baton to his
[time=1226] son Jacob and Jacob ran and he lived for God.
[time=1231] And Jacob took the baton and he placed it at the end of his hand life in the hand of his son Joseph.
[time=1239] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry
[time=1248] the baton and Hebrews chapter 11 moves us all the way through the Old Testament right up to the very day that this writer would pen his words and he was God's spokesperson
[time=1260] for that day, he was the one that would carry the baton.
[time=1265] Peter was given the baton by Christ, Peter gave it to Clement of Rome, Clement of Rome
[time=1271] passed it on through the church, it came into the hand of Augustine and Augustine would write of the city of God and the city of man and he would shape theology for the centuries and would carry the baton and throughout history it would go from hand to hand to Anselman
[time=1287] from Hasta Luther and Luther would stand up in front of an angry diet of worms and he
[time=1295] would say to a council of cardinals, "Sola Scriptura, the scriptures only" and out of
[time=1304] that phrase was born a reformation that would bring life back to the church of Jesus Christ because someone would say, "The scriptures only" and Luther gave his life for Christ
[time=1316] and he carried that baton and it went from Luther to the Anabaptist.
[time=1321] Those weren't folks who were against baptism, Anamines again, they were people who said, "We've got to be baptized again and be committed" and it went from them and it crossed throughout to the Hugonauts of France and went across the English Channel to John Wesley and Charles Wesley who had come up with a method of teaching children God's Word and the method was so
[time=1341] good they called them the Methodists.
[time=1345] God has always had a people.
[time=1348] Someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=1355] Wesley sent over missionaries to the wilderness land of the Americas, Francis Asbury, came
[time=1363] into this part of the United States to convert the settlers and the Indians that they might know that Jesus Christ is alive and he carried the baton and churches began to spring up
[time=1374] across the Midwest and went from church to church, people carrying the baton.
[time=1379] God raised up a Charles Finney who would preach to 20,000 people standing on a tree stump
[time=1386] without a microphone proclaiming Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1391] The baton went throughout history being passed from person to person from a Charles Finney
[time=1397] to a Dwight L. Moody, a man who couldn't speak the King's English with any dignity.
[time=1404] A man who would stand before Cambridge University and say, don't think God don't love you before he do and they would laugh and mock but they would come to put their faith in Christ because
[time=1416] he carried the baton that went from a Moody to a Billy Sunday, a man who knew how to steal bases on a baseball field but he learned to tell people about Christ from a Billy Sunday
[time=1428] to perhaps a Billy Graham.
[time=1432] But while that was going on there were churches that were being built into the time went into the hand of a man by the name of Tom Younger, pastor of a manual Baptist church who God
[time=1443] would give the vision of planting churches and so the baton would go not only into Tom's hand but he would place it in the hand of a dozen different churches throughout northern Indiana and western Ohio so this very day the baton is placed in our hands.
[time=1466] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=1478] The baton is now placed in your hands.
[time=1487] You are God's runner today.
[time=1492] God has no other plan for evangelism, God has no other plan for missions, God has no
[time=1498] other plan for outreach than this church today and other churches just like it.
[time=1508] You see, when you're a part of a relay there is a unique sense of obligation that if you
[time=1517] run or in my case swim well you are swimming for those three other people and if you disqualify
[time=1524] yourself you disqualify all of the rest of them as well.
[time=1530] If you're ever at an athletic meet you'll find all kinds of people cheering for you.
[time=1535] But the fans from your school are not the ones who will cheer the loudest.
[time=1540] If you win they'll say we won and if you lose they'll say you lost.
[time=1545] They won't be the ones who will cheer the loudest.
[time=1548] Not even the parents of the participants will be the ones who will cheer the loudest although they are very very faithful.
[time=1554] The ones who will cheer the loudest are the ones who are a part of the team with you.
[time=1561] I can remember swimming in the Ohio State and Auditorium in the state championships.
[time=1566] It was a 400 or 200 medley relay and I was the butter flyer.
[time=1571] I can remember swimming down 25 yards.
[time=1575] There were a thousand people in an auditorium that held 500 screaming and shouting for every other cheer but I could hear John Cooper, the breaststroker at the other end of the
[time=1586] poll that every time my head came up for air I could hear him like a mad man yelling go he was insane but he moved us and he was in all American and he was committed to that
[time=1603] relay.
[time=1605] This passage is saying as we sit here today remember we are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses
[time=1614] in heaven at this very moment Noah is sitting there, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Luther, Haas,
[time=1624] Calvin, Zwingley, Asbury, they are there and they are saying I have run and I am giving
[time=1630] you the baton.
[time=1632] What will you do with it?
[time=1636] Remember we never represent ourselves in Christ.
[time=1640] We always represent the church of eternity and the Savior who gave his life for it.
[time=1648] A second principle, these words, "Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does
[time=1660] so easily beset us." A runner in my case a swimmer must not only race remembering the team they are a part
[time=1670] of but they must always race unencumbered.
[time=1674] I don't know if you have ever been to a swim meet but if you haven't you can probably imagine that this is true.
[time=1681] You will never see a swimmer swimming in his warm-ups.
[time=1686] Big sweat clothes, hooded shirt, you will never see him stand up on the blocks, bend down and take that leap right into the pool.
[time=1693] If you do, bet on the other guy.
[time=1697] A swimmer and a runner has to be totally unencumbered.
[time=1700] As a matter of fact, swimmers do a number of strange things.
[time=1705] One of which is a process they call a shave down.
[time=1709] Maybe you have seen it on television at the Olympics.
[time=1711] But swimmers will shave the hair off their arms, from under their arms, off their head, off their legs, off their chest, those who had hair there.
[time=1720] I never did.
[time=1723] But they shave everything down because that little bit of resistance may make the difference.
[time=1729] In 1969, the Big Ten freshman championships were held at Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[time=1736] There was a young guy from Santa Clara Swim Club swimming for IU by the name of Mark Spitz.
[time=1744] In the 50-yard freestyle down and back, a good friend of mine from Calga Falls High School, the name of Billy Cat, was swimming for Ohio State.
[time=1754] For Spitz, this was just another meet.
[time=1756] But for Cat, this was all there was.
[time=1760] So Spitz came in as though it was just another race, but Billy Cat came in bolder than a cue ball.
[time=1766] His red hair didn't even have nubs.
[time=1769] He was completely shaved down.
[time=1771] 50 yards down and back, the swimming is so fast and so close that no human referee could
[time=1778] ever tell who won.
[time=1780] There are electronic plates in the water that when the swimmer touches it, it shuts off electronic clocks and stops the clock to the nearest one-thousandths of a second.
[time=1790] Swimmers took their mark, they went down and back, and in less than 21 seconds the race was over.
[time=1795] And literally every team that had a player in that race jumped up and yelled we won.
[time=1800] You couldn't tell who won.
[time=1802] Since all the electric clocks running wild and they stopped, and when they all stopped,
[time=1810] Bill Cat beat Mark Spitz by three-one-thousandths of a second, three-one-thousandths of a second.
[time=1824] I haven't seen Bill Cat since that day, but I bet he's told that story a few times.
[time=1830] And the reason why he beat the greatest swimmer in the world is because he swam unencumbered.
[time=1838] Nothing holding him back.
[time=1840] This passage says let us run unencumbered free from two things.
[time=1846] First of all, free from every weight.
[time=1851] Anything that would hold the runner back, he or she quickly shedded.
[time=1858] So you and I must shed anything that can hold us back.
[time=1862] And this is not talking about sin, we're going to come to that in a moment.
[time=1865] This is talking about good things that can hold us back.
[time=1869] You see if Satan can't get us to be disqualified by sin, then what he'll do is he'll get us entangled and encumbered in so many other affairs, we don't have time to do what God wants us to do.
[time=1879] Let me ask you this.
[time=1883] In light of eternity from which everything will be measured, what difference does it make
[time=1889] if we sell more insurance than anyone else, but we never lead anyone to the assurance
[time=1895] of a home in heaven?
[time=1897] Measure that against eternity.
[time=1900] What difference does it make if we build houses with the most magnificent quality as a contractor, but we never teach anyone how they can build a home in heaven that they can have at eternity?
[time=1914] What difference does it make if we have the voice of a virtuoso and we can sing that
[time=1921] a charm is not only the audience but the city, that we haven't tuned our hearts to
[time=1927] sing his praises?
[time=1930] What difference does it make if you can run or shoot a basketball or swim or strike a
[time=1937] tennis ball or race but you're not in God's race?
[time=1945] The athlete like the soldier lays everything aside to achieve his or her one critical goal
[time=1951] and ours is to serve Christ, to know him and to make him known.
[time=1956] We must be unencumbered from that.
[time=1959] Secondly, we must be unencumbered from sin.
[time=1964] This passage says these sin that does so easily beset you and theologians throughout the centuries have each given their opinion as to what these sin is.
[time=1973] I'm here today to tell you what it is.
[time=1976] It's whatever sin Satan tempts you with.
[time=1979] It may be one thing for you and another thing for you and a third one for me, but sin simply
[time=1985] means to fall outside of the acceptable standard.
[time=1991] In 1970 our high school was participating in the Fairview Relays.
[time=1996] It was the biggest relay event in the state of Ohio.
[time=1999] My team had never won it, but this was our year.
[time=2002] We had done so well that going into the last relay, the 400 free relay, we were 15 points
[time=2009] ahead of the team in second place.
[time=2012] The exciting thing is you only get 16 points for winning the relay.
[time=2016] If Firestone High School came in first, they got 16 points and if we only came in last,
[time=2022] we got one point and we were tied for first place.
[time=2026] More exciting thing is the four guys we had on that relay were all juniors and sophomores.
[time=2030] They were sixth in the state of Ohio.
[time=2032] There were not six teams that could beat them.
[time=2037] So that relay began.
[time=2039] We knowing that the race was going to be ours and the meat would be ours.
[time=2046] Next man in that relay dove in, swam down and back down and back and brought us in in a dead tie for first place.
[time=2052] Only Firestone High School was even close to us.
[time=2054] The others were already about a half a length behind.
[time=2058] The next guy went and it was a dead tie and the next guy went and it was a dead tie and the next guy went and we got touched out for first place.
[time=2065] Firestone got 16 points, but we got 13 points for second place.
[time=2070] We won the meat and very humbly began to yell, "We're number one, we're number one."
[time=2076] And I'll never forget Mark.
[time=2078] Jumped up on the starting blocks, took a big black towel with a gold CF for Calga Falls,
[time=2084] trolling it over his head, yelled, "We're number one," and flipped himself into the water, came up cheering.
[time=2091] And as he did that, the official walked over to our starting block, took a red flag out of his pocket, laid it on our block, signifying we were disqualified.
[time=2100] Because in swimming there is a incidental little rule that says a contestant cannot re-enter the water until a race is officially declared over and outside in lane six from
[time=2110] Berea Med Park was a guy just barely finishing the race.
[time=2117] And instead of our 13 points, 13 points for second place, we not only didn't get those 13, we didn't even get one for last place, we got zero and we lost the meat.
[time=2129] Because we were disqualified.
[time=2132] If also Paul said, "I bring my body into subjections so that after I've spent my life
[time=2138] preaching the others, I will not be disqualified."
[time=2144] If we are going to serve Christ, it's got to be encumbered from both good things that keep us from doing the best thing and certainly from sin that will weight us down.
[time=2153] The third principle is this, it says, "Let us run with patience." Patience is a fine translation, let me suggest an alternate one, "Let us run with endurance."
[time=2166] You see, serving Jesus Christ is not a hundred yard dash if it were, all of us would be great.
[time=2173] Any one of us can rise to the occasion for today and do what God wants us to do.
[time=2177] The question is not just what will you do for Christ today, but what will you do for him tomorrow and in all the tomorrows of your life.
[time=2186] Christian race is not a sprint, it is a lifelong marathon, it has to be run with endurance.
[time=2193] And so the commitments that we make to serve, and particularly on these critical days to give, need to be commitments not only that we can make today, but commitments that will make for three years.
[time=2204] It's a long endurance.
[time=2206] For the brevity of time, let me move now to the fourth principle.
[time=2210] This principle is always true of athletics, it is this principle, that the sacrifice always
[time=2220] precedes the satisfaction, but that the satisfaction always exceeds the sacrifice.
[time=2231] Our high school coach, I believe, was trained under the Marquis desaude.
[time=2238] Swim practice under him was something less than a pleasant experience.
[time=2242] First of all, it began at 6 a.m. in the morning, you had to be there, changed and in the water and warmed up at 6 a.m. and he locked the door.
[time=2251] And we swam until 12 minutes till eight.
[time=2255] He figured it couldn't possibly take you more than 12 minutes to get out of the water, shower, rinse the chlorine out of your eyes, change clothes and be over, pick your books out of the locker and be in your first class at eight o'clock.
[time=2268] And swim practice started seven minutes after the school bell rang and went for another three hours.
[time=2273] Can I tell you that after four seasons of swimming, 11 months a year, I'm still trying to remember the first practice I liked.
[time=2283] I hated them all, but I love the meats.
[time=2291] I love the races.
[time=2293] And I had to give the sacrifice before I could have satisfaction.
[time=2302] When it comes to serving Jesus Christ, it's hard work to be a part of evangelism, it's hard work to teach children, it's hard work to be a nursery worker, it's hard work to be an usher, it's hard work to go through the music practices for the living Christmas tree.
[time=2316] But when that tree lights up, you bet it's true, the satisfaction exceeds the sacrifice.
[time=2326] Jim Elliot knew that and he said, "He is no fool who gives up that which he cannot keep,
[time=2332] to gain that which he could never lose." I'm going to be very blunt, we're asking you to give up an awful lot.
[time=2338] I don't know what it will be for you to give to celebrating God's grace.
[time=2343] It will be a sacrifice.
[time=2344] For some of you, it will be a small one because of your great resources you can give and maybe
[time=2350] it not greatly affect you, but for others of you, it will be an enormous sacrifice.
[time=2358] But the principle of God's word is that he calls us to sacrifice.
[time=2362] The promise that the satisfaction will always exceed the sacrifice.
[time=2371] Where did I get that?
[time=2372] Verse 2, it says, "Looking unto Jesus, he's the beginner and the finisher.
[time=2378] Who, for the joy, that's the satisfaction that was set before him, endured the cross
[time=2385] despising the shame, that's the sacrifice.
[time=2391] But Jesus had the ability to be visionary and to see beyond the three years that he
[time=2398] suffered as a prophet and priest and king and died for the satisfaction of redeeming
[time=2404] us to Christ." And you know, the exciting thing is, we already know who won.
[time=2411] A couple of years ago, it was in August, I was watching a football game and Cathy walked in the room.
[time=2416] I said, "Watch, this Joe Mantown is going to drop back, he's going to throw it past.
[time=2420] The white car is going to jump up in the end zone, pull it down, it's going to be a touchdown." That's exactly what happened.
[time=2424] I should have seen her look at me, she thought a prophet was in her midst.
[time=2429] Few more plays I called it play-by-play and finally I explained to her that the game we were watching was a replay of the previous year's Super Bowl.
[time=2439] Pretty easy to know the outcome of history, isn't it?
[time=2443] And you know why we're sitting here today, we're looking at the next three years and we're saying that's future and to us it's future, but the God, it's history.
[time=2450] He said, "Jesus is the beginning and Jesus is the end, he's the one who is and the one who was and the one who is now and the book of Revelation tells us don't worry about the score.
[time=2460] At the end of the game, Jesus wins.
[time=2463] And I speak for me, my house, that we want to do all we can to be on that team.
[time=2471] Oh God today, we would pray that you would put in our hearts a determination to win.
[time=2478] I'm not just for ourselves and our church, but because you've always had a people, someone
[time=2486] who would run for you, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=2497] God give us victory, not just for ourselves, but for your church, glorious, universal and
[time=2505] most of all for your son or savior, to him be the glory in the churches, both now and
[time=2511] forevermore, amen."
[time=2531] "Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses.
[time=2540] Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with
[time=2546] patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and to set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
[time=2571] "God has always had a people, a people who had run his race, a people who had followed
[time=2599] him by faith.
[time=2601] By faith, Noah, being warned of God of things not sinning yet, moved with fear.
[time=2608] By faith, Abraham obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went.
[time=2616] By faith, Moses refused to be called to son O'Carol's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction
[time=2622] with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[time=2629] By faith, Joshua, by faith, Rahab, by faith, Gideon, by faith, David, by faith, Samuel.
[time=2641] God has always had a people, someone to run for him, someone to carry the baton.
[time=2648] Solar Scriptura, with those words Martin Luther founded the Reformation on the commitment
[time=2654] to the scriptures only.
[time=2657] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=2665] Two brothers, John and Charles Wesley, teamed up, one to preach, one to write music.
[time=2672] In his lifetime, John Wesley wrote many miles on horseback to spread the gospel.
[time=2678] Charles Wesley wrote dozens of hymns that remain precious to the church this very day.
[time=2684] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=2692] Charles Finney spoke to audiences of 10,000 people and more without the aid of a microphone,
[time=2698] standing on a tree stump in the wilderness of Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana.
[time=2702] Historians called it the second great awakening.
[time=2707] White El Moody, a shoe salesman, gave his heart to God and covenanted with a Savior that he
[time=2713] would not let a day pass in which he failed to tell at least one soul about Jesus Christ.
[time=2722] Billy Sunday was called off a dusty baseball diamond to call a nation to repentance.
[time=2732] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=2737] In 1969, through the vision of the Immanuel Baptist Church, a commitment of seven families
[time=2746] and the energy of a young pastor, David Jeremiah, the Black Hawk Baptist Church began.
[time=2753] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton for him.
[time=2759] That's what those first seven families did, as they met in two mobile homes that the Black Hawk Baptist Church first called home.
[time=2767] Within a year's time, the young, growing congregation hired an architect to develop a 20-year master plan and authorized to buy an issue of $200,000.
[time=2777] At groundbreaking on August 30, 1970, Pastor Thomas Younger and Immanuel Baptist Church presented
[time=2784] us with a deed to the five acre tract of land on State Street as a gift.
[time=2788] The big day arrived in September 1971 as the congregation moved into their new sanctuary.
[time=2794] Once again, Black Hawk had room to extend a warm welcome to the community they were striving to reach for Christ.
[time=2802] But in 1972, Black Hawk expanded again as groundbreaking for phase two, known as the
[time=2808] educational wing occurred.
[time=2810] Another major step of faith was taken in 1973 when Black Hawk Christian School was founded
[time=2816] offering grades pre-kindergarten through four.
[time=2819] Thirty-nine students were enrolled that first year.
[time=2822] Black Hawk also had our first taste of TV when we broadcast our first half hour Christmas special in December of 1973.
[time=2831] On Sunday, September 8, 1974, we began broadcasting this service live.
[time=2836] It was then known as the Heritage Island.
[time=2839] In 1974, with our nation's 200th birthday just around the corner, we celebrated the first patriotic panorama.
[time=2847] Today, 13 panoramas later, we're still singing about the freedom we enjoy as a country and
[time=2853] as individuals, the freedom we know through Christ our Savior.
[time=2857] On September 15, 1975, the impossible offering was collected meeting the goal of $75,000.
[time=2864] This was the exact amount needed for the planning and development of phase three, the Convocation Center.
[time=2873] On May 16, 1976, the congregation worshiped together in the new Convocation Center for the first time.
[time=2880] Previously, part of the worshipers met and watched the morning service via closed-circuit television in order to accommodate visitors.
[time=2889] In 1977, the first living Christmas tree was presented.
[time=2893] Today it is enjoyed by almost 20,000 people annually.
[time=2897] God continues to use it as a tool to once again reach the lost around us and also to encourage believers.
[time=2904] It makes Christmas special to many of us and reminds us of the true meaning of Christmas.
[time=2911] In the fall of 1978, George and Mary Lampman joined us to start the Super 60s Ministry.
[time=2918] 1980 brought another first as Blackhawk Christian High School graduated their first class of seniors.
[time=2925] In 1983, Rick Hawks accepted the call to become our senior pastor.
[time=2932] But now it is 1986 and new challenges await us.
[time=2936] Do we share the same joy and vision of those first seven families?
[time=2941] Are we ready to celebrate with the same commitment and dedication that made what we enjoy today possible?
[time=2947] God has always had a people, someone who would run for Him, someone who would carry the baton for Him.
[time=2954] A new day is rising for Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2958] Increased opportunities and blessings face us daily.
[time=2961] These are not ordinary times and this is not an ordinary task before us.
[time=2966] God has entrusted so much to us we must work together as never before.
[time=2972] The challenge before us requires this congregation to be at its best.
[time=2977] For that to happen, it requires each of us to be at our best.
[time=2982] Our best coupled with God's best will ensure the victory that is ahead.
[time=2987] We must build an additional building.
[time=2989] A new sanctuary must be constructed to meet the needs we face.
[time=2995] We will not build a gigantic auditorium, but one that will allow us to begin with one service and expand to two worship services if necessary in the future.
[time=3005] It will be functional and practical.
[time=3008] It is desperately needed right now.
[time=3011] Through the Celebrate God's Grace program, we will construct that facility.
[time=3017] Today, more than ever, we must visualize the opportunities ahead and recognize the importance
[time=3023] of this challenge.
[time=3025] This is not merely the building of buildings, but a focal point where God can minister to and through His people, where the body of Christ is being matured into His likeness
[time=3036] and where the Word of God is being sent forth in great power.
[time=3040] We will meet this challenge as we move together in the sharing of the resources God has entrusted to us.
[time=3047] We must construct this facility to enlarge our ministry base, and it must be paid for.
[time=3053] This is the enormous challenge that is before us.
[time=3057] God's work on this earth is done primarily through the church.
[time=3061] He needs committed people through which to carry out His will.
[time=3065] Every believer is a minister with time, talents, gifts, and financial resources to share.
[time=3072] Commitment is not a burden.
[time=3073] It is a joy which leads to obedience and to further and fuller joy.
[time=3078] It is now our opportunity to discover how God will work to us and celebrate God's grace.
[time=3084] It is our opportunity to witness that God can do the seemingly impossible.
[time=3090] You are wondering what your part is to be?
[time=3093] Each individual and each family should consider their stewardship responsibilities.
[time=3101] God has always had a people, someone who would run for Him, someone who would carry
[time=3107] the baton for Him.
[time=3131] The challenge to your heart from God's Word.
[time=3151] We want you to know, brothers, of the divine grace that has been granted to the Macedonian churches under terrible ordeal of affliction, and their great happiness combined with their
[time=3162] deep poverty have overflowed into a wealth of their generosity.
[time=3167] How up to their ability, yes, and I bear them witness beyond their ability, they voluntarily,
[time=3174] cheerfully, willingly gave, most urgently begging us for the favor of taking a part in
[time=3183] this service to the Lord.
[time=3187] They did not do simply what we hoped for, but they gave themselves first to the Lord,
[time=3196] and so to us and in keeping with the will of the Lord.
[time=3202] Would you bow your heads with me just for a moment?
[time=3205] We're going to read a lengthy passage in a moment.
[time=3208] Before I do, though, I want us to bow our heads and do exactly what Paul said the Macedonian
[time=3215] people did.
[time=3217] Before they gave their dollars, they recommade themselves to the Lord and to their fellow
[time=3223] Christians.
[time=3224] Would you bow your heads with me?
[time=3226] Our Heavenly Father Lord, today, you and all of those saints who have gone before us,
[time=3234] the cloud of witnesses that Pastor spoke of, watch in expectancy what we will do.
[time=3247] And Lord just now, before we talk about dollars, we talk about commitment and Father as a group,
[time=3261] as a team, but as individuals, we recommit ourselves to you.
[time=3270] We ask for forgiveness for those sins and the weights that do so easily beset us.
[time=3276] Remove those from us, Father.
[time=3279] And then, Father, having recommitted ourselves to you, we recommit ourselves to the body of
[time=3285] Christ, our fellow Christians.
[time=3289] The team with whom we run, and Father, we do that to the glory of Jesus Christ in celebrating
[time=3301] your grace to us, amen.
[time=3306] I'm not issuing an order, Paul said, but I would test the genuineness of your love by
[time=3314] the eagerness of others, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how although He was rich yet, He became poor for your sakes, so that you by His poverty might become rich.
[time=3327] Let me advise you in this matter, it is to your interest because when you made the commitment a while back, the first act that you did was to make that commitment, and now then complete
[time=3338] the enterprise so that your readiness and desiring it may be equaled by the task accomplished
[time=3345] to the measure of your means, for if there is present a willing mind, the gift is appreciated
[time=3353] in proportion to what one possesses, not to what one does not possess.
[time=3359] In order to afford relief to others, you need not put on a heavy burden on yourself, rather
[time=3365] share fairly.
[time=3367] Let your abundance at this time make up their shortage so that their surplus may go toward your lack and thus conditions may become equalized as it is written the one who got much had
[time=3379] nothing left over and the one who had little did not lack.
[time=3384] Show them then of your love and of our boasting about you such as will be evidenced before
[time=3394] all the churches.
[time=3397] I know of your willingness and I boast about you saying that they were ready a year ago
[time=3403] and your zeal has stirred up a large number of other Christians.
[time=3412] And I say this that he who sows sparingly shall reap sparingly and he who sows liberally
[time=3422] will reap also liberally.
[time=3425] But each one give as he has planned in his heart neither grudgingly nor by compulsion
[time=3434] for God loves a cheerful, a happy, a willing giver and God is able to pour out on you richly
[time=3443] every possible grace so that you will always and under all circumstances have plenty for
[time=3452] your own need and an abundance for every good work as it is written.
[time=3458] He that scattereth abroad he has given to the poor his righteousness never fails.
[time=3466] Now he who provides seed to your sowing and food to eat will also supply and multiply
[time=3474] your store of seed and will increase the harvest of your righteousness.
[time=3483] You will be enriched in every respect in all kinds of generosity and your liberality
[time=3494] as it is worked out through us will cause thanksgiving unto God.
[time=3500] For the rendering of this service not only supplies amply the wants of the saints but it also abounds in its causing many thanksgiving to God.
[time=3511] Because of the proof of this service they are praising God for your loyalty to the good
[time=3517] news about Christ which you confess and for the liberality of your contribution to them
[time=3523] all and for them all and we all feel a yearning for you in our prayers because of the unusual
[time=3532] measure of divine grace that is upon you.
[time=3539] Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[time=3548] I hope that as you and your family pray earnestly about your commitment that you will make
[time=3555] it all that God would have it to be not anymore and not any less but that it will show back
[time=3566] to the Lord your thankfulness for the grace that has been bestowed upon you and it will
[time=3576] show to those round about you as you share with others that you have committed to the
[time=3583] work of the Lord here the grace that is God is working in your heart and life.
[time=3592] An African missionary was standing with a visitor beside the road as a progression of
[time=3598] pagan worshipers marched up a mountain to make their offering to their pagan God.
[time=3608] The visitor noticed a young mother with two children one of them was crippled and deformed
[time=3616] and she held in her arms the other was beautiful and whole and walking by her side.
[time=3628] The visitor commented to the missionary about that scene ask the missionary where they were
[time=3636] going and the missionary said they're going up the mountain to make an offering to their
[time=3642] God.
[time=3645] The next day they were standing there again by the road the missionary was speaking a good word to each of those who passed by and giving a cup of water to those in the name of Christ as they passed.
[time=3658] The visitor saw that same young mother again but this time she only had the deformed child
[time=3664] in her arms.
[time=3668] The other child the whole the beautiful child was not there the visitor said where is the
[time=3676] other child?
[time=3679] The missionary said she gave it to her God.
[time=3689] The visitor said why did she not give the deformed child why did she not keep the perfect
[time=3696] child for her own?
[time=3700] The missionary cut to the very heart of that visitor's soul when he answered it's a pagan
[time=3710] God but they would not think of offering anything but the best to their God.
[time=3725] Our Lord gave his best he gave himself to you and me God gave his best his only son
[time=3740] to you and me can we do any less as you pray through about your commitment would you make
[time=3752] it an act of grace.
[time=3782] that's what we have to do.
[time=3786] We are going to have a good day.
