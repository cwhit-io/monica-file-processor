[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] Hello, I'm Rick Hawks, and it's my privilege to be the pastor of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=136] Just a few weeks ago, our church had an exciting service in downtown Fort Wayne at the new Grand Wayne Center.
[time=144] At this point in our church's life, we're planning a program called Celebrating God's Grace.
[time=150] It's our church's attempt to honor God by building a new sanctuary that will allow our growing congregation to meet at one time in one place
[time=160] and still have room for you and other friends to join us.
[time=164] We went to the Grand Wayne because our church is presently in two crowded services, and by going to that one large civic auditorium, we could meet together for that special Sunday.
[time=175] During that hour, actually two, we had a variety of great music and a challenge from God's Word.
[time=182] We wish we could have shared it with you at that time live, but because of the intensity of that day we were not able to.
[time=189] But through the labor of love of our television ministry and its crew, today we can share the excitement of that event with you.
[time=198] I hope you'll join us in praying for the future of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and its growing needs as a congregation
[time=205] as we endeavor to reach out to the community of Fort Wayne through our church and our television ministry.
[time=211] We've been looking forward to sharing this hour with you.
[time=214] Thank you for joining us today for this special edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=228] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=238] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=240] As Rick mentioned, today's program is based on a very special service, which our church experienced on November 16 at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=249] On that Sunday, over 1,700 members and friends of Black Hawk Baptist Church gathered for a two-hour celebration of music, fellowship and sharing of God's Word.
[time=259] Today's program will feature special music from that service, including the sanctuary point, second generation, the Black Hawk singers,
[time=273] Maryland Wall, and celebration.
[time=279] As a part of this special service, Rick will be sharing with us from Hebrews 12-1 and 2 in a message he is entitled, "Hasing the Botan."
[time=290] The Bible Hour is an extension ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=299] Now from the Grand Wayne Center, let's begin our service by listening to the sanctuary choir and orchestra.
[time=309] It is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul, it is well with my soul.
[time=333] As a part of my soul, as a part of my soul, and all that is within me, as a part of my soul,
[time=382] let all that is within me, as it's all within me, as a part of my soul.
[time=412] I'm just going to tell you what's happening to me, cause trying to keep still is an impossibility.
[time=427] All the time they tried to show me, but now you wouldn't know me, I'm changing.
[time=438] I'm just going to tell you what's happening to me, cause I met this Jesus for myself, my feet won't touch the street.
[time=448] I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, cause I'm just going to tell you what's been happening to me.
[time=468] If you could see inside of me, you'd be excited too.
[time=473] What I dream that I could be is starting to come true.
[time=478] There's been a renovation, an awesome transformation, and I just can't keep myself from telling you.
[time=488] I'm just going to tell you what's happening to me, cause trying to keep still is an impossibility.
[time=501] All the time they tried to show me, but now you wouldn't know me, I'm changing.
[time=511] I'm just going to tell you what's happening to me, cause it's no extra secret and I've got to make you see.
[time=521] I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, and I'd sure like to show you what Jesus did for me.
[time=542] I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, I'm just going to tell you, just got to tell you, just got to tell you, I'm just going to tell you what's happening to me.
[time=566] Got to tell you, I'm just trying to keep still is an impossibility.
[time=572] All the time they tried to show me, but now you wouldn't know me, I'm changing.
[time=582] But I'm changing, I'm changing.
[time=596] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for this special edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=604] Pete, two weeks ago when we were at the Grand Wayne, it was an exciting Sunday, wasn't it?
[time=609] That was a spectacular day, Rick, it really was.
[time=612] You know, I can't imagine how much work it was for you and the whole music department to put an hour of music together as a part of that two-hour service.
[time=620] Well, I think as a highlight of the word that comes to my mind is involvement, from preparing it to Saturday afternoon's involvement of our television crew and sound crew and then all of the people that sang and just participated in the entire service, that was exciting.
[time=636] You know, it's hard for people who are watching the television ministry to imagine how many man hours of work went into simply moving all of our television equipment from here to the Grand Wayne for one broadcast and then move it all home.
[time=649] There's about seven miles of cord in our ceiling here at the Convocation Center and most of that was taken out to prepare for the lighting and the sound that we used at the center.
[time=660] You know, for me, one of the exciting things was to feel the intensity of our people as we talked about our church's future.
[time=667] We're in a program that we're calling Celebrating God's Grace and it is a program amongst the people, Blackhawk Baptist Church, to design and to commit ourselves to the financial responsibilities of building a new sanctuary.
[time=681] And I'm certainly excited about that.
[time=683] Rick, there's a realism when you start thinking about a sanctuary that holds maybe 2,000 people, that there's a plain fact that it costs a lot of money.
[time=692] And I think in the hubbub and the interest of building that building, we've been working very hard to continue to serve God with praise in our hearts.
[time=700] You know, occasionally when people start hearing the cost of a 2,000-seat sanctuary, that it's nearly $4 million, that blows your mind.
[time=708] It's a little bit above our budget for our family. Mine too, even yours and mine put together.
[time=713] But you know, when you break that down and you realize that 2,000 people can be seated in that auditorium, the cost for one person to come and worship in that church is no greater than if it was a small church that only seated 100 people.
[time=726] That's right, Rick. Every seat costs so much money, but as you multiply it over the number of people that we have in our congregation and those that faithfully give, we're just thankful that they do that.
[time=736] And we're looking forward to seeing all of us join together in one service in just a couple years.
[time=742] Oh, that would be exciting. Our church presently meets in a multi-purpose convocation center that meets our needs extremely well.
[time=750] Fortunately, or unfortunately, we fill it, the two morning worship services beyond the auditorium into the overflow room.
[time=757] And there's a need for us if we're going to continue to reach more people for Christ to build a larger auditorium to allow us to reach out and bring more people under the hearing of God's Word.
[time=769] And so this is an exciting process, isn't it?
[time=771] Yes, Rick. Not only are the people here in our convocation center, and we are bulging the seams in two services, but there's been a great outreach with our television ministry.
[time=781] It doesn't make any difference really where we go. There just seems to be people that are supporting the ministry.
[time=787] And we're really anxious to continue to upgrade that particular portion of Black Hawk Baptist Church's ministries.
[time=794] You know, the church has the privilege of sharing our services by way of television.
[time=799] And as Pete mentioned, we always meet people, whether we're at the mall, the hospital, a basketball game, who take the time to tell us that they appreciate the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=809] As a matter of fact, this past week, one man accepted Christ as Savior who heard about the Lord Jesus through the Bible hour through our senior adult ministry, and a trip you took him on on a trip with Super 60s last winter.
[time=821] Right? We've been praying for a long time for Chris, and we're just praising the Lord that he did accept him as his personal Savior.
[time=827] Now, that's exciting.
[time=829] And as our church is growing, so is our television ministry.
[time=832] And just as our church is in need of new facilities and equipment, so is the Bible hour.
[time=838] The average life expectancy of television, cameras, and equipment is about seven years.
[time=843] Well, this faithful camera and set of equipment that we have is already 10 and a half years old, and by the time we're able to replace it, we'll probably be 12 to 13 years old.
[time=854] It's equipment that is vital for the outreach of the Bible hour, and it's equipment that we're going to need to replace.
[time=861] So as we share the challenge with our people here at Blackhawk, today we're sharing that exact same challenge with you friends who watch us by way of television.
[time=870] For many of you, you write in often and share with us that this ministry is your spiritual lifeline, and now we're asking you to help us with the life of your lifeline, the Bible hour.
[time=881] Pete, you're such an important part of the church and the Bible hour and the music that you supply is always refreshing, and I certainly appreciate this special effort that went into last Sunday when we were at the Grand Wayne.
[time=893] Well, we're talking about involvement again, Rick, and I just want to publicly thank all the people that involved in the music program because certainly we can't do it alone.
[time=902] And that shows a real strength in our program here where people are involved because they want to represent Jesus Christ this way, and it's an avenue of service for them, and we're grateful for all of them.
[time=913] You know, the Bible hour is a lot like our choir. It's not just one person all by themselves. It's more than a hundred people strong, and our strength as the book of Ecclesiastes is teaching us is not when one man stands alone, but when there's two and three, and we stand together.
[time=931] And at this time, we're asking you to stand with us as a television ministry. At the end of the broadcast, I'm going to share with you how you can help support the Bible hour in a very critical need that we have, and that is a need for new television equipment.
[time=945] We have a very meager budget. Almost all of our budget goes for airtime and equipment costs. Our salaries are extremely small. We have a few people who work for the church and work part-time for the Bible hour in the office, and one man who coordinates it.
[time=960] Salaries are very small. It's the airtime and this equipment that we need your help with, and as this show comes to an end today, we'll share with you how you can have a part in celebrating God's grace.
[time=972] The same program that we're doing as a church you can be a part of by way of the television ministry as you support the Bible hour.
[time=980] The next message that you're going to hear is one that we shared at the Grand Wayne. It's something that came from the depths of my heart. To be honest, I've shared this message a number of times, but never hear it black off until this very special day.
[time=993] Now I'm looking forward to sharing it with you as we celebrate God's grace together.
[time=1023] Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful, yes wonderful. Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful, it is to me.
[time=1038] Ooh, all this has the universe around me, reaching to the farthest soul away. Baby keeping love it was a down knee.
[time=1052] That is why my heart can truly say. Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful, yes wonderful. Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful?
[time=1067] Wonderful, it is to me. Ooh, there will never be a sweeter story. Story of the Savior's love divine.
[time=1082] I love that writing thrown around the fully. Just to say the simple soul like mine.
[time=1090] Thank the love of Jesus something wonderful, yes wonderful. Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful, wonderful. It is to me.
[time=1106] Love beyond all human comprehending. Love of God in Christ how can it be? This will be my theme and never ending.
[time=1129] Great Redeeming Love on Calorie. Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful? Wonderful, wonderful. Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful?
[time=1143] Wonderful, it is to me. Oh, isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful? Yes wonderful. Isn't the love of Jesus something wonderful?
[time=1157] Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. It is to me.
[time=1177] All you children of peace and all you lovers of freedom. All you seekers of justice and all who wait for Messiah to come rejoice in the Lord rejoice, rejoice in the Lord rejoice.
[time=1198] For soon he is coming to love here, rejoice in the Lord rejoice.
[time=1211] All you trust in his love and all who wait for his righteousness. All who tasted his mercy and all who hope in his faithfulness.
[time=1225] Rejoice in the Lord rejoice. Rejoice in the Lord rejoice. For soon he is coming to rule of the earth, rejoice in the Lord rejoice.
[time=1246] Hallelujah. Hallelujah is His name. Hallelujah He will reign forever He will reign.
[time=1264] All you children of peace and all you lovers of freedom. All you seekers of justice and all who wait for Messiah to come rejoice in the Lord rejoice.
[time=1282] Rejoice in the Lord rejoice. For soon he is coming to rule of the earth, rejoice in the Lord rejoice.
[time=1313] I hope you have your Bible with you and if you do please turn in it now to Hebrews chapter 12 and verses 1 and 2.
[time=1324] In Hebrews chapter 12 the writer is using an analogy between the Christian life and the world of athletics.
[time=1335] That's a great illustration for the American mind because we are inundated with sports and with television.
[time=1343] One lady kissed her husband on the first day of September and said honey I've sure enjoyed this and all look forward to seeing you after the Super Bowl.
[time=1352] I hope you have a great fall. We love sports in our culture and I believe athletics can teach us some great insights about life
[time=1362] and God obviously thinks that way too because he uses athletics in several key passages of the scriptures.
[time=1369] First Corinthians chapter 9 it talks about a runner. Philippians chapter 3 it talks about a runner.
[time=1377] First Corinthians chapter 9 it talks about a boxer, a fighter, a wrestler and here in Hebrews chapter 12 once again a runner.
[time=1387] It reads like this in the King James Bible.
[time=1390] Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about, surrounded if you will with so great a cloud of witnesses.
[time=1400] Let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily besets us and let us run with patience.
[time=1414] The race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,
[time=1422] who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1437] I would like to take from this passage four principles that rise out of athletics that God wants us to apply to our lives as believers in Christ.
[time=1448] Just as the athlete trains conditions and peaks for one event, we as a believing body of Christians have been trained and we have been peaked for this one event that we have gathered here today to celebrate.
[time=1466] These four principles I believe are principles that need to mark us day by day as individual believers and these are four principles that need to govern the decisions that you and I will make as families as it relates to celebrate God's grace.
[time=1480] Now for some of you you've heard principles one and four because we shared those upstairs three weeks ago in the ballroom at our advanced commitment reception.
[time=1490] But let me share those four principles with you again.
[time=1493] Now before I get into the four principles though, I need to explain one thing.
[time=1499] Many of you have been a black hawk for a number of years and know a little of my background, others of you do not know.
[time=1505] I spent my high school years in the field of competitive swimming.
[time=1510] Now I'm going to use some things I learned as a competitive swimmer to illustrate these points but I need to explain something to you first of all.
[time=1518] From time to time you hear speakers like Bill Glass who was an all pro defensive end for the Cleveland Browns in a spokesperson for Christ.
[time=1528] The man who led me to Christ David Burnham was a four time all American at Wheaton College in a drafted by the Washington Redskins.
[time=1538] Some guys are all pro and other guys are all American.
[time=1542] Now when it came to swimming I was not all pro.
[time=1547] I was not all American.
[time=1550] I was not all state of Ohio.
[time=1553] I was not all Calga Falls High School.
[time=1556] The only all that I was in swimming was all wet and that didn't amount to very much.
[time=1561] My coach said to me at the end of my junior year he said hawks you are an amazing swimmer.
[time=1566] As a matter of fact you are the only swimmer I know it can swim in three gears.
[time=1571] Slow, stop and sink.
[time=1574] And he shared with me that there weren't a lot of college scholarships available with those credentials.
[time=1581] All that is to say please don't get enamored with the illustrations.
[time=1584] It was bush leg at best.
[time=1586] But four principles.
[time=1588] Principle number one is this.
[time=1591] Remember you are a part of a team.
[time=1595] Various sports take place as individuals and others as a part of a team.
[time=1601] If you are a golfer once you get your grip and your swing down and you make the circuit you really only represent yourself.
[time=1608] You are not a part of a team.
[time=1610] You are an individual.
[time=1612] If you are a part of a track team but you are a simple individual man you throw the shot put or the disc.
[time=1619] Or you throw the javelin and keep the audience alert.
[time=1623] Or if you are a 100 yard dash man but never a part of a relay you only win or lose for yourself.
[time=1630] But if you are a part of a football team or a basketball team or you are on a swim team you are part of a relay.
[time=1637] If you are on a track team and you are part of the 400 relay then you represent more than just yourself.
[time=1643] You represent others who are part of that team.
[time=1646] So if you win you win not only for you you win for that relay team.
[time=1651] And if you lose you not only lose for yourself but you lose for the others who are on that relay team.
[time=1660] Now if you look at the first word of Hebrews chapter 12 it is the word wherefore.
[time=1666] At risking offending our English teachers who are here today I believe that word is a conjunction.
[time=1672] Words like wherefore therefore and but are conjunctions they are trying to tie what has already been said with that which is about to be said.
[time=1684] Now we have already read what follows the wherefore but what we haven't done as looked at what preceded it.
[time=1690] Now remember this when God inspired his word he inspired it as one narrative the book of Hebrews.
[time=1696] It wasn't until later that chapters and verses were inserted. So Hebrews chapter 11 actually flows straight into chapter 12.
[time=1704] There is no real break there.
[time=1707] Someone has correctly identified Hebrews chapter 11 as God's Hall of Fame.
[time=1713] And as you look back at Hebrews chapter 11 verse 7 it says by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear.
[time=1726] In verse 8 it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receiving inheritance obeyed not knowing where he went.
[time=1737] Verse 9 by faith he's sojourned. Verse 20 by faith Isaac. Verse 21 by faith Jacob.
[time=1745] Verse 22 by faith Joseph. Verse 23 by faith Moses when he was born was hidden by faith verse 24 Moses.
[time=1756] Then you come down to verse 35 and women receive their dead raised to life again and others.
[time=1765] I believe what the writer of Hebrews wants us to see is that God has always had a people.
[time=1773] Someone who would run for him someone who would carry the baton.
[time=1780] What is being pictured here is that God took Noah and out of all humanity he raised Noah up to be a single spokesperson and Noah like a relay runner ran his life serving God.
[time=1795] And at the end of his life God had another person or another group of people and Noah simply stretched out his arm at the end of his life and placed the baton into the hand of the next generation.
[time=1807] And they ran and God called an Abraham and Abraham ran with his life and he took the baton at the end of his life and he placed it into the hand of his son Isaac and Isaac lived for God.
[time=1821] And at the end of his life Isaac would give the baton to his son Jacob and Jacob ran and he lived for God.
[time=1829] And Jacob took the baton and he placed it at the end of his hand life in the hand of his son Joseph.
[time=1837] God has always had a people someone who would run for him someone who would carry the baton.
[time=1847] And Hebrews chapter 11 moves this all the way through the Old Testament right up to the very day that this writer would pen his words.
[time=1857] And he was God's spokesperson for that day. He was the one that would carry the baton.
[time=1863] Peter was given the baton by Christ. Peter gave it to Clement of Rome. Clement of Rome passed it on through the church.
[time=1871] It came into the hand of Augustine and Augustine would write of the city of God and the city of man and he would shape theology for the centuries and he would carry the baton.
[time=1882] And throughout history it would go from hand to hand to Anselman, from Anselman to Hasim, from Hasta Luther.
[time=1889] And Luther would stand up in front of an angry diet of urns and he would say to a council of cardinals, "Sola scripture, the scriptures only."
[time=1902] And out of that phrase was born a reformation that would bring life back to the church of Jesus Christ because someone would say, "The scriptures only!"
[time=1912] And Luther gave his life for Christ and he carried that baton and it went from Luther to the Anabaptist.
[time=1919] Those weren't folks who were against baptism, Anamines again. They were people who said, "We've got to be baptized again and be committed."
[time=1926] And it went from them and it crossed through out to the Hugonauts of France and went across the English channel to John Wesley and Charles Wesley who had come up with a method of teaching children God's Word.
[time=1939] And the method was so good they called them the Methodists. God has always had a people.
[time=1946] Someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=1953] Wesley sent over missionaries to the wilderness land of the Americas, Francis Asbury, came into this part of the United States to convert the settlers in the Indians that they might know that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1968] And he carried the baton. And churches began to spring up across the Midwest and went from church to church, people carrying the baton.
[time=1977] God raised up a Charles Finney who would preach to 20,000 people standing on a tree stump without a microphone, proclaiming Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1989] The baton went throughout history being passed from person to person from a Charles Finney to a Dwight L. Moody.
[time=1999] A man who couldn't speak the King's English with any dignity. A man who would stand before Cambridge University and say, "Don't think God don't love you before he do."
[time=2009] And they would laugh and mock but they would come to put their faith in Christ because he carried the baton.
[time=2016] They went from a Moody to a Billy Sunday, a man who knew how to steal bases on a baseball field but he learned to tell people about Christ.
[time=2025] From a Billy Sunday to perhaps a Billy Graham.
[time=2030] But while that was going on, there were churches that were being built into the time and went into the hand of a man by the name of Tom Younger.
[time=2038] Pastor of a manual Baptist church who God would give the vision of planting churches and so the baton would go not only into Tom's hand but he would place it in the hand of a dozen different churches throughout Northern Indiana and Western Ohio.
[time=2056] So this very day the baton is placed in our hands. God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=2079] The baton is now placed in your hands. You are God's runner today. God has no other plan for evangelism. God has no other plan for missions.
[time=2095] God has no other plan for outreach than this church today and other churches just like it.
[time=2108] You see when you're a part of a relay there is a unique sense of obligation that if you run or in my case swim well you are swimming for those three other people and if you disqualify yourself you disqualify all of the rest of them as well.
[time=2128] If you're ever at an athletic meet you'll find all kinds of people cheering for you. But the fans from your school are not the ones who will cheer the loudest. If you win they'll say we won and if you lose they'll say you lost.
[time=2144] Not even the parents of the participants will be the ones who will cheer the loudest although they are very very faithful. The ones who will cheer the loudest are the ones who are part of the team with you.
[time=2160] I can remember swimming in the Ohio State Natatorium and the state championships. It was a 400 or 200 medley relay and I was the butterfly. I can remember swimming down 25 yards.
[time=2173] There were a thousand people in an auditorium that held 500 screaming and shouting for every other cheer but I could hear John Cooper, the breaststroker at the other end of the pole that every time my head came up for air I could hear him like a madman.
[time=2189] Yelling go! He was insane but he moved us and he was an all-American and he was committed to that relay. This passage is saying as we sit here today remember we are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses in heaven at this very moment.
[time=2215] Noah is sitting there, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Luther, Haas, Calvin, Zwingley, Asberry, they're there and they're saying I've run and I'm giving you the baton. What will you do with it?
[time=2233] Remember, we never represent ourselves in Christ. We always represent the church of eternity and the Savior who gave his life for it.
[time=2246] A second principle, these words. Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us. A runner, in my case a swimmer must not only race remembering the team that they're a part of but they must always race unencumbered.
[time=2273] I don't know if you've ever been to a swim meet but if you haven't you can probably imagine that this is true. You'll never see a swimmer swimming in his warm-ups.
[time=2283] Big sweat clothes, hooded shirt, never see him stand up on the blocks, bend down and take that leap right in the pool. If you do, bet on the other guy.
[time=2295] A swimmer and a runner has to be totally unencumbered. As a matter of fact, swimmers do a number of strange things. One of which is a process they call a shave down.
[time=2306] Maybe you've seen it on television at the Olympics but swimmers will shave the hair off their arms from under their arms, off their head, off their legs, off their chest, those who had hair there. I never did.
[time=2321] But they shave everything down because that little bit of resistance may make the difference. In 1969, the Big Ten freshman championships were held at Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[time=2334] There was a young guy from Santa Clara Swim Club swimming for IU by the name of Mark Spitz.
[time=2342] In the 50 yard freestyle down in back, a good friend of mine from Cowga Falls High School, the name of Billy Cat was swimming for Ohio State.
[time=2352] For Spitz, this was just another meet but for Cat, this was all there was.
[time=2358] So Spitz came in as though it was just another race but Billy Cat came in bolder than a cue ball. His red hair didn't even have nubs.
[time=2367] He was completely shaved down. 50 yards down and back, the swimming is so fast and so close that no human referee could ever tell who won.
[time=2378] There are electronic plates in the water that when the swimmer touches it, it shuts off electronic clocks and stops the clock to the nearest one thousandths of a second.
[time=2388] Swimmers took their mark, they went down and back and in less than 21 seconds the race was over and literally every team that had a player in that race jumped up and yelled we won.
[time=2398] You couldn't tell who won. You saw the electric clocks running wild and they stopped.
[time=2405] And when they all stopped, Bill Cat beat Mark Spitz by three one thousandths of a second.
[time=2418] Three one thousandths of a second. I haven't seen Bill Cat since that day but I bet he's told that story a few times.
[time=2428] And the reason why he beat the greatest swimmer in the world is because he swam unencumbered. Nothing holding him back.
[time=2438] This passage says let us run unencumbered free from two things. First of all free from every weight.
[time=2449] Anything that would hold the runner back, he or she quickly shedded.
[time=2456] So you and I must shed anything that can hold us back. And this is not talking about sin.
[time=2462] We're going to come to that in a moment. This is talking about good things that can hold us back.
[time=2467] You see if Satan can't get us to be disqualified by sin, then what he'll do is he'll get us entangled and encumbered in so many other affairs.
[time=2474] We don't have time to do what God wants us to do. Let me ask you this.
[time=2481] In light of eternity from which everything will be measured, what difference does it make if we sell more insurance than anyone else but we never lead anyone to the assurance of a home in heaven?
[time=2495] Measure that against eternity. What difference does it make if we build houses with the most magnificent quality as a contractor but we never teach anyone how they can build a home in heaven that they can have it in eternity?
[time=2510] What difference does it make if we have the voice of a virtuoso and we can sing that a charm is not only the audience but the city but we haven't tuned our hearts to sing his praises.
[time=2528] What difference does it make if you can run or shoot a basketball or swim or strike a tennis ball or race but you're not in God's race?
[time=2543] The athlete like the soldier lays everything aside to achieve his or her one critical goal and ours is to serve Christ, to know him and to make him known. We must be unencumbered from that.
[time=2557] Secondly, we must be unencumbered from sin. This passage says the sin that does so easily beset you and theologians throughout the centuries have each given their opinion as to what the sin is and I'm here today to tell you what it is.
[time=2574] It's whatever sin Satan tempts you with. It may be one thing for you and another thing for you and the third one for me but sin simply means to fall outside of the acceptable standard.
[time=2590] In 1970 our high school was participating in the Fairview Relays. It was the biggest relay event in the state of Ohio. My team had never won it but this was our year. And we had done so well that going into the last relay, the 400 free relay, we were 15 points ahead of the team in second place.
[time=2610] Now the exciting thing is you only get 16 points for winning the relay. So if Firestone High School came in first, they got 16 points and if we only came in last, we got one point and we were tied for first place.
[time=2624] The more exciting thing is the four guys we had on that relay were all juniors and sophomores. They were sixth in the state of Ohio. There were not six teams that could beat them.
[time=2636] So that relay began. We knowing that the race was going to be ours and the meat would be ours. First man in that relay dove in, swam down and back down and back and brought us in in a dead tie for first place.
[time=2651] The Firestone High School was even close to us. The others were already about a half a length behind.
[time=2656] The next guy went and it was a dead tie and the next guy went and the next guy went and we got touched out for first place. Firestone got 16 points but we got 13 points for second place.
[time=2668] We won the meat and very humbly began to yell, "We're number one. We're number one." And I'll never forget Mark. Jumped up on the starting blocks, took a big black towel with a gold CF for Calga Falls, trolling it over his head yelled, "We're number one," and flipped himself into the water, came up cheering.
[time=2689] And as he did that, the official walked over to our starting block, took a red flag out of his pocket, laid it on our block signifying we were disqualified.
[time=2698] Because in swimming there is a incidental little rule that says a contestant cannot re-enter the water until a race is officially declared over and outside in lane six from Berea Medpark was a guy just barely finishing the race.
[time=2715] And instead of our 13 points for second place, we not only didn't get those 13, we didn't even get one for last place, we got zero and we lost the meat because we were disqualified.
[time=2731] The apostle Paul said, "I bring my body into subjections so that after I've spent my life preaching to others, I will not be disqualified."
[time=2742] If we are going to serve Christ, it's got to be unencumbered from both good things that keep us from doing the best thing and certainly from sin that will weight us down.
[time=2751] The third principle is this, it says, "Let us run with patience." Patience is a fine translation, let me suggest an alternate one.
[time=2760] Let us run with endurance.
[time=2764] You see, serving Jesus Christ is not a hundred yard dash if it were, all of us would be great.
[time=2771] Any one of us can rise to the occasion for today and do what God wants us to do.
[time=2775] The question is not just what will you do for Christ today, but what will you do for him tomorrow and in all the tomorrow's of your life.
[time=2784] Christian race is not a sprint, it is a lifelong marathon, it has to be run with endurance.
[time=2791] And so the commitments that we make to serve, and particularly on these critical days to give, need to be commitments not only that we can make today, but commitments that will make for three years.
[time=2802] It's a long endurance.
[time=2805] For the brevity of time, let me move now to the fourth principle.
[time=2808] This principle is always true of athletics, it is this principle, that the sacrifice always precedes the satisfaction, but that the satisfaction always exceeds the sacrifice.
[time=2829] Our high school coach, I believe, was trained under the Marquis Desaude.
[time=2836] Swim practice under him was something less than a pleasant experience.
[time=2840] First of all, it began at 6 a.m. in the morning, you had to be there, changed and in the water and warmed up at 6 a.m. and he locked the door.
[time=2849] And we swam until 12 minutes till 8.
[time=2853] He figured it couldn't possibly take you more than 12 minutes to get out of the water, shower, rinse the chlorine out of your eyes, change clothes and be over, pick your books out of the locker and be in your first class at 8 o'clock.
[time=2866] And swim practice started seven minutes after the school bell rang and went for another three hours.
[time=2872] Can I tell you that after four seasons of swimming, 11 months a year, I'm still trying to remember the first practice I liked.
[time=2881] I hated them all.
[time=2885] But I love the meats.
[time=2889] I love the races.
[time=2891] And I had to give the sacrifice before I could have the satisfaction.
[time=2900] When it comes to serving Jesus Christ, it's hard work to be a part of evangelism, it's hard work to teach children, it's hard work to be a nursery worker, it's hard work to be an usher.
[time=2910] It's hard work to go through the music practices for the living Christmas tree.
[time=2914] But when that tree lights up, you bet it's true.
[time=2919] The satisfaction exceeds the sacrifice.
[time=2925] Jim Elliott knew that.
[time=2926] And he said, "He is no fool who gives up that which he cannot keep to gain that which he could never lose."
[time=2933] I'm going to be very blunt.
[time=2934] We're asking you to give up an awful lot.
[time=2936] I don't know what it will be for you to give to celebrating God's grace.
[time=2941] It will be a sacrifice.
[time=2942] For some of you, it will be a small one because of your great resources you can give.
[time=2948] And maybe it not greatly affect you, but for others of you, it will be an enormous sacrifice.
[time=2956] But the principle of God's word is that he calls us to sacrifice with the promise that the satisfaction will always exceed the sacrifice.
[time=2969] Where did I get that?
[time=2970] Verse 2, it says, "Looking unto Jesus, he's the beginner and the finisher.
[time=2976] Who, for the joy, that's the satisfaction that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame?"
[time=2986] That's the sacrifice.
[time=2990] But Jesus had the ability to be visionary and to see beyond the three years that he suffered as a prophet and priest and a king and died.
[time=3001] For the satisfaction of redeeming us to Christ.
[time=3005] And you know the exciting thing is, we already know who won.
[time=3009] A couple of years ago, it was in August, I was watching a football game and Kathy walked in the room.
[time=3014] I said, "Watch this, Joe Mantone is going to drop back, he's going to throw it past.
[time=3018] The white car is going to jump up in the end zone, pull it down, it's going to be a touchdown." That's exactly what happened.
[time=3023] She had a senior look at me, she thought a prophet was in her midst.
[time=3027] A few more plays I called it play by play and finally I explained to her that the game we were watching was a replay of the previous year Super Bowl.
[time=3034] It's pretty easy to know the outcome of history, isn't it?
[time=3039] And you know why we're sitting here today, we're looking at the next three years and we're saying that's future.
[time=3044] And to us, it's future, but the God, it's history.
[time=3047] He said, "Jesus is the beginning and Jesus is the end.
[time=3050] He's the one who is and the one who was and the one who is now and the book of Revelation tells us, don't worry about the score.
[time=3057] At the end of the game, Jesus wins." And I speak for me and my house that we want to do all we can to be on that team.
[time=3069] Oh God today, we would pray that you would put in our hearts a determination to win.
[time=3077] Not just for ourselves and our church, but because you've always had a people.
[time=3084] Someone who would run for you.
[time=3088] Someone who would carry the baton.
[time=3093] God give us victory, not just for ourselves, but for your church, glorious, universal, and most of all for your son or savior.
[time=3105] Do Him be the glory in the churches, both now and forever more.
[time=3111] [AMEN]
[time=3118] [MUSIC]
[time=3123] This time is now, receive it all, and it here attends a favor from the king.
[time=3134] His reward is grand.
[time=3137] His gift is in his hand.
[time=3140] For all who reach to hold it is there.
[time=3146] He'll miss it every way.
[time=3151] He's here to do what he came to do.
[time=3156] He's the Savior, healer, delivery, deamer.
[time=3163] Counselor, Refiner, Jesus, Messiah, now.
[time=3179] This time is now.
[time=3181] His love is here to work a total transformation in your soul.
[time=3190] Follow every care.
[time=3193] His supply is there for strength to hold and power to be changed.
[time=3201] He'll set the captain's screen, provide for every name.
[time=3207] He's here to give what he came to give, if we allow Him to.
[time=3212] He's the Savior, healer, delivery, deamer.
[time=3219] Counselor, Refiner, Jesus, Messiah, He says,
[time=3225] If you'll come to me, I'll run, not walk to you.
[time=3230] Give me a heart that's faithful and watch what I will do.
[time=3236] I'm able to accomplish it according to my word.
[time=3241] You just wait on me and see.
[time=3246] He says, If you'll come to me, I'll run, not walk to you.
[time=3250] I'm not walking to you.
[time=3252] Give me a heart that's faithful and watch what I will do.
[time=3256] That's what I will do.
[time=3258] I'm able to accomplish it according to my word.
[time=3263] You just wait on me and see.
[time=3267] The time is now to celebrate.
[time=3272] And thank Him for His resurrection life.
[time=3276] Oh, that He came to revive.
[time=3281] Every dream that died.
[time=3283] And certain motion, all that's standing still.
[time=3289] Invite His presence in, just ask Him to begin.
[time=3295] He's here to be what He came to be, if we allow Him to.
[time=3300] He is the Savior, He learned to live a redeemer.
[time=3307] Counselor, Refiner, Jesus, Messiah.
[time=3313] Helper, restore, build a rewarder.
[time=3318] The giver of life is here.
[time=3322] Receive Him now.
[time=3338] The time is now to celebrate and to thank Him for His resurrection power.
[time=3347] I love that song both for the music but also for the message.
[time=3351] And the time is now in the life of the Blackhawk Baptist Church and in the life of the Bible hour for us to celebrate, to celebrate God's grace.
[time=3361] As the church we're doing that right now, endeavoring to raise one and a half million dollars or more in financial commitments to build a new sanctuary and supporting worship facilities.
[time=3372] I'm excited to share with you that just one week into that project, we're almost there.
[time=3378] We're celebrating God's grace and our people are making an enormous commitment to the future of reaching this community with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3387] The time is now to celebrate.
[time=3390] To celebrate God's grace not only is a church but as a television ministry and we need your help to do that.
[time=3398] Many of you have written often, sharing your encouragement with us, telling us how the Bible hour has ministered in your life.
[time=3405] We deeply appreciate those letters and phone calls and personal words of encouragement when we meet in the streets of our city.
[time=3413] Many of you have received a letter from us entitled Celebrating God's Grace.
[time=3418] In that letter we shared with you that we need to raise several hundred thousand dollars towards the purchase of new television equipment.
[time=3426] Cameras, switches, control panels that allow us to broadcast the Bible hour.
[time=3432] Now I know that we can't raise those hundreds of thousands of dollars all at one time but we need to take the first step.
[time=3439] And that step is to at least raise twenty five thousand dollars before the end of this year and we need to ask your help.
[time=3447] The scripture invites each of us to give who have a willing heart and we're not trying to manipulate you or entice you to do anything you don't want to do.
[time=3455] But many of you do want to help and because of that we do want to ask for your help.
[time=3460] If you receive that letter please don't do what Rick and Kathy do.
[time=3464] We often receive mail and we look at and we say we need to do something about that and then we lay it down in the stack right next to our telephone and it goes unheated.
[time=3474] If you receive that letter I'd like to ask you right now to take the letter out, read it and pray about what God would want you to do.
[time=3482] If you haven't received a letter from us and you would like to know more information please forgive us.
[time=3487] We didn't write simply because we didn't know you were one of our viewers.
[time=3491] But if you would write to us today and include whatever questions or gifts you have we would be so appreciative of a letter and a gift from you.
