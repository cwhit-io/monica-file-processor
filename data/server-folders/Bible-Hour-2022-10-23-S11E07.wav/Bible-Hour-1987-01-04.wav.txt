[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] When Paul wrote to the Corinthians about the Resurrection Body, he anticipated two questions that they would have, and probably two questions that most of us are thinking about today.
[time=119] The first question was this, how are the dead raised?
[time=123] What about somebody who was killed in a house fire and their body was totally destroyed?
[time=128] How can God raise that body up?
[time=131] Or what about somebody whose body was mutilated in a car accident?
[time=135] How can they be raised up?
[time=138] And then the second question was, and what are those bodies like?
[time=143] I mean, if somebody was born mentally handicapped and they die, is God going to raise them up to be forever mentally handicapped?
[time=152] Or if a child dies?
[time=154] Is it going to inherit eternity forever in diapers?
[time=160] What does the Bible say is the answer to these very honest questions?
[time=177] Thanks for joining us, Rick's message today is taken from 1 Corinthians 15 and is entitled "New Hope for Old Bodies."
[time=191] What will our heavenly bodies be like?
[time=193] Most of us would like to make some operations to our bodies, some of us would like to be taller or thinner, others would like to be free from arthritis or cancer.
[time=203] We don't know everything about our heavenly bodies, but 1 Corinthians 15 gives us some new hope for old bodies.
[time=211] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=216] We will be looking at verses 35 through 15.
[time=220] We'll also be hearing special music from our own sanctuary choir
[time=226] and our special musical guests, the Life Action Singers.
[time=232] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=241] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=246] Now here's Rick.
[time=248] It's so privileged to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=252] We trust that God will use this service in every life to strengthen our faith in Christ and to challenge us to serve Him.
[time=261] Many of us are coming off of a great week of joy.
[time=264] Time spent together with the family, a family visiting from out of town, perhaps a break from work.
[time=272] Still others of us have gone through some difficult times.
[time=276] But for each of us, God offers a singular gift, the gift of peace.
[time=281] Jesus said, "My peace, give I unto you, and my peace is not fragile like the peace the world gives.
[time=288] Let your heart be not troubled. Neither let it be a frame." A song that's become a favorite of our church is that promise of Christ, that there is peace.
[time=298] In the midst of every storm of life, there is peace.
[time=303] May the peace of God be with you.
[time=318] [MUSIC]
[time=335] In a world that's right, my sin and sorrow,
[time=343] there is peace.
[time=348] When you find no hope for your tomorrow,
[time=356] there is peace.
[time=361] When it seems your heavy burden is much too much to bear.
[time=374] In Jesus there is perfect peace.
[time=386] There is peace.
[time=399] In the midst of every storm of life, there is peace.
[time=412] Give your blood your trust in Jesus, and let him have his way.
[time=425] Give my peace.
[time=438] If you're tired of all life's rush, and there is peace.
[time=454] If your mind is filled with fear and worry, there is peace.
[time=471] Your problems overwhelm you, and fill you with despair.
[time=484] In Jesus there is perfect peace.
[time=496] There is peace.
[time=510] In the midst of every storm of life, there is peace.
[time=523] Give your blood your trust in Jesus, and let him have his way.
[time=536] You'll find peace, perfect peace today.
[time=555] You'll find peace, peace, wonderful peace.
[time=568] Come again from the Father of God.
[time=578] Sing over my spirit, forever my praise.
[time=594] In heaven the skills and rules of man.
[time=604] Tell of the skills of those.
[time=614] I'm your God, peace.
[time=634] It's comforting to know that Jesus Christ can bring peace in the midst of a storm.
[time=639] What a blessing that is to our hearts today.
[time=642] Let's continue to worship the king as we turn to him number 11.
[time=645] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas of all worship, the king.
[time=663] Let's sing the first, third, and fourth, and fourth stanzas of all worship.
[time=754] Thank you for your good singing today.
[time=756] Again, we appreciate it when you worship with us through the medium of music.
[time=760] There are certain times in the life of our church that we invite people to come into the sanctuary choir.
[time=766] Usually at the beginning of the fall season or in January.
[time=770] We are now beginning a new season of music in the choir.
[time=774] If you've been interested in joining the choir and would like to have more information concerning your membership in the choir,
[time=780] please sign the gold registration card or call the music office.
[time=784] We'd be glad to have you join us and tell you about the ministry of our sanctuary choir.
[time=791] For some weeks now, we've been advertising that the Life Action musical team would be with us from Buchanan, Michigan.
[time=796] They're here today. They're going to be singing for us in the morning service.
[time=801] And then tonight, I want you to make a special point to come back and join us for our evening service at six o'clock.
[time=806] They will be presenting a program that's entitled "The Family Holding On For Life."
[time=812] It'll be three-screen multimedia presentation along with some great music and some music and preaching that will challenge your heart
[time=819] concerning the ministry of the family. Please make it a point to come back with us and join Life Action for their ministry at six o'clock in our evening service.
[time=828] Now, let's listen to the musical ministry of Life Action as they sing for us at this time.
[time=833] [MUSIC][MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] Come into His chorus with praise and sing a joyful song [MUSIC] Sing out with gladness [MUSIC] Sing from all sadness [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] Come into His chorus with praise and sing a joyful song [MUSIC] Sing out with gladness [MUSIC] Sing from all sadness [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] I'll be triphoned in the Lord [MUSIC] So many souls have tested Him [MUSIC] Throughout the course of time [MUSIC] So many still reach out to Him [MUSIC] With broken hearts and minds [MUSIC] And every one of them will say [MUSIC] With no exceptions that they find [MUSIC] Jesus never fails [MUSIC] Even in the days of old [MUSIC] He brought His people through [MUSIC] And then He came to show His love [MUSIC] And He died for me and you â™ª
[time=1028] Then He rose again to grow. Every story had been true. Jesus never fails.
[time=1043] Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails.
[time=1057] You might as well get me behind. Be sick then. You cannot prevail because Jesus never fails.
[time=1071] Never fail. Sometimes this world brings trouble. We find so hard to bear. We know we could make it without Jesus being there.
[time=1088] It's so encouraging to know how ever deep we're in despair.
[time=1101] So what did we do to prove to you? How can you deny? No one told facts, no mysteries. It's also kind and dry.
[time=1114] On the wind you stand with your light. We'll be the first to test it all.
[time=1122] Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails.
[time=1143] You might as well get me behind. Be sick then. You cannot prevail because Jesus never fails.
[time=1186] You might as well get me behind. Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails.
[time=1198] You never fails.
[time=1212] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1219] Thank you for joining us again today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1223] This is our first broadcast of a brand new year, 1987. Pete, after the living Christmas tree, are you rested up and ready to go?
[time=1232] Yes, we are, Rick. We had a great December with the ministry of the living Christmas tree, but we're already excited about the ministries that we have for 1987.
[time=1240] Well, they begin today in a special way with the Life Action Singers.
[time=1243] Already we've heard the ministry of Life Action Singers in our service today, and they'll be with us tonight.
[time=1249] We'd like to encourage those of you that are watching to come to the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 6 p.m.
[time=1254] where Life Action Singers will be presenting the family holding on for life.
[time=1259] An ideal program for the entire family, and Rick, I think it's just going to really encourage us to hang on to our families and to love one another.
[time=1267] I'm looking forward not only to the music which we always enjoy with the Life Action Singers, but this particular message that they've planned.
[time=1274] If they have a multimedia presentation with three large screens, and I think it's going to be very graphic, very inspirational,
[time=1280] and certainly we'll tug at the heart and remind us of the family and our responsibility. That's so important.
[time=1286] We hope that many of you are able to come. If you're a church-going person and your church has an evening service,
[time=1293] please understand we're not trying to steal you away from your church.
[time=1297] So many of you are not going to church or your church doesn't have an evening service, and we want to invite you, friends in particular,
[time=1304] to join us not just today by way of television, but come in person tonight for the special program by the Life Action Singers.
[time=1311] If you're watching and don't know our location, we're on East State Boulevard here in Fort Wayne, just about a mile past Georgetown Shopping Center.
[time=1320] At 7321 East State Boulevard, you'll find the Blackhawk Baptist Church and the programs tonight at 6 o'clock. I'm sure looking forward to that.
[time=1329] Coming up in just a few weeks on the last two days of this year, January the 30th and the 31st, we have a special seminar with Walk Through the Bible Ministries.
[time=1340] It is called a Walk Through the Old Testament.
[time=1343] During this seminar on Friday night and Saturday morning, you'll be taught in an entertaining, lively, enthusiastic way, a way that calls for you to participate, the whole Old Testament.
[time=1356] All of those 39 books with their various personalities and historical events will be put down in a brief, easy-to-remember format that will give you a good grip on God's Word, the Old Testament.
[time=1370] If you would like to be a part of the Walk Through the Bible seminar, please simply write to us or call us. Our church phone number is 749-8524.
[time=1382] Again, that is 749-8524, and request information on the Walk Through the Bible seminar, and we'll be glad to give that to you so you can be a part of it.
[time=1393] We'll be right here at Blackhawk and we want you to join us. Walk Through the Bible seminar come from Walk Through the Bible Ministries who provide an excellent pamphlet for us called Timeless Insights.
[time=1404] We also want to share that with you today. Timeless Insights is a systematic way of studying through the New Testament over a one-year time period.
[time=1414] As we've begun a new year, we want to encourage you to commit yourself to the habit of studying God's Word daily.
[time=1422] The Bible says of itself that it is food for our souls. If we're going to grow physically, we have to eat, and the same is true spiritually.
[time=1431] Timeless Insights takes you through a New Testament in one year, giving you a selected passage of Scripture to read, and then an insight, a timeless one, if you will, from some of the great men of faith.
[time=1442] And then it gives you some great applications. Every day you can use it, only take about 10 or 12 minutes, but it will enrich your life in great ways. We'll send it to you free if you'll simply write to us today.
[time=1455] Let me encourage you to write for Timeless Insights today. You can write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1466] If you've made a New Year's resolution, if anyone, you should make this one, that you will covet to pray and read your Bible. Let me give you that address again. It's the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1481] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, we're so pleased to have the life action singers with us. I know you'll enjoy their ministry again. And then please open your Bibles and your hearts to study 1 Corinthians chapter 15, and we'll be looking at verses 35 through 50 today, a message that we've called New Hope for Old Bodies.
[time=1511] When I survey the wondrous cross on which the prince of glory died,
[time=1537] my richest king, I count but false,
[time=1551] and for the Gentile, my friend,
[time=1567] for be it Lord, and I should vote.
[time=1580] Save Jesus in the death of Christ, my God.
[time=1593] Oh, love in things shall let you leave us.
[time=1607] I sacrifice them to His blood.
[time=1621] See from His head, His head, His feet.
[time=1634] Sorrow and love the meaning of God.
[time=1684] Therefore, God also hath highly exalted, and given the name which is without every name, that after the name of Jesus, every nation without, and every time to death, that Jesus Christ would vote.
[time=1703] Pray the whole land of nature and life, that war on presence, and far to His blood.
[time=1724] God so amends it in, that the divine demands my soul, my right, my heart.
[time=1745] Depends my soul, Depends my life, Depends my life.
[time=1766] God, we today have come to say to you that your love compels us to give our life our all.
[time=1786] Father, in these brief moments of worship today, we've come to say that you are God, and we are your people, and that we love you.
[time=1795] And we want to serve you with our life.
[time=1797] We thank you for the majesty of a song that brings praise your name and motivates us to surrender.
[time=1805] God today, we would ask that you would challenge us today by your word and by your spirit, that you would restore us to a full measure of faith.
[time=1817] We pray that you would rekindle the fire and fan the flames that we might burn hot with enthusiasm for Christ.
[time=1827] Father, we confess to you that indifference and selfishness, apathy and greed of own desire often have squeezed us to the point of spiritual compromise.
[time=1840] And we today want to make a statement of recommitment to you.
[time=1845] And we, as we on this first Sunday of a new year meet, we would ask that your spirit would meet with us, and that there might be a reconsecration of our lives for a new year to be new and fresh in service.
[time=1861] Father, today, we would pray that you would not only renew all of us, but that you would particularly refresh those missionaries who are a part of us who are supposed to be home on furlough resting, who still have major responsibilities and enormous workloads
[time=1880] that in spite of it all, you would renew them and fill their cup.
[time=1884] We pray for Mike and Carolyn and the whole ballast family, Mary Cruz, Lori Eby, Debbie and Denny Howard.
[time=1893] As they are studying and working, even though it's a time of rest, that you would refresh them so that as they return to their fields of service, they might have new power and new energy.
[time=1904] Father, we would pray today for Peter Davis that the medication would fight the infection and that he might be able to return home.
[time=1913] We pray that you'll help him to pass the time in the hospital quickly and meaningfully.
[time=1918] Father, we would pray today for the family of Alberta Swallow that as she is now absent from the body and present with the Lord that you would be present with their family and comfort them.
[time=1930] We pray for Steve McFarlane as he wrestles with arthritis, that you would give doctors wisdom.
[time=1937] We pray for others who are suffering, that you as the God of all comfort would comfort each one.
[time=1943] Or it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1948] I hope that you brought your Bible with you today, and if you did, please open it to 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[time=1957] If you're visiting with us here at Black Hawk today, or perhaps watching by television for the first time, we are a Bible-studying church.
[time=1966] So as you worship with us, please bring two things, an open Bible and an open heart.
[time=1972] We've been studying for several weeks from 1 Corinthians 15, and today I would like to read for you chapter 15 verses 35 through 50.
[time=1984] These are the words of the Apostle Paul as he wrote to the Church of Corinth.
[time=1989] They begin with two rhetorical questions.
[time=1993] But some will say, "How are the dead raised up, and with what body do they come?"
[time=2002] Thou fool.
[time=2004] That which thou soest is not made alive except it die, and that which thou soest thou soest not, that body that shall be, but a bare grain.
[time=2019] It may chance of wheat or of some other grain, but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed its own body.
[time=2035] All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another kind of flesh of beasts, another of fish, and another of birds.
[time=2046] There are celestial bodies, and there are bodies terrestrial.
[time=2053] But the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
[time=2059] There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for one star differs from another in glory.
[time=2070] So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in incorruption. It is raised in incorruption.
[time=2078] It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness. It is raised in power.
[time=2088] It is sown a natural body. It is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
[time=2100] And so it is written, "The first man, Adam, was made a living soul. The last Adam was made a life-giving spirit."
[time=2111] The first man is of the earth, earthly. The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[time=2122] As is the earthly, such are they also that are earthly. And as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
[time=2136] And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
[time=2145] Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither death, corruption, inherit, incorruption.
[time=2160] This passage is written with an insight into the questions that were being raised by some of the Corinthians.
[time=2169] Questions that were raised then and now, two of them to begin with. The first question is this. Some man will say, there is always somebody somewhere, right?
[time=2180] Some man will say, "How are the dead raised up?" And the second question, "And with what body will they come?"
[time=2191] If you remember from our earlier studies, there were Jewish skeptics who didn't believe in eternal life, didn't believe in the resurrection of the body, didn't believe in angels, they were naturalists, they were called Sadducees.
[time=2206] Not only were there Jewish people of that mind, there were even more of that mind who were of the Greek persuasion. Some were Gnostics, some were just naturalists.
[time=2215] The Gnostics divided everything and life into two, the good and the bad. The good was the spirit part of us. The bad was the body part of us.
[time=2227] And since heaven was good, they could imagine a spirit going to heaven, but they couldn't imagine a body going to heaven.
[time=2233] And so they began to raise some questions, kind of questions that were really objections, trying to undermine the whole belief in the resurrection.
[time=2242] They said, "How are the dead raised up?" For example, suppose that you died in a house fire and your whole body was burned to a crisp, there was nothing left but charred bones and ashes.
[time=2256] How's God going to raise that up? Or what about Roger Williams, founder of Providence, Rhode Island?
[time=2265] When Roger died, the people buried him right under an apple tree. Years later, they exhumed his body to put it in a more appropriate cemetery and to make a national monument out of it.
[time=2277] And when they got down, they discovered that the root of that apple tree had driven right through the wood coffin and into Roger Williams' body and had assimilated it.
[time=2287] Now the theological problem is this, everybody who ate one of those apples ate part of Roger Williams. And in the resurrection, who's going to get that molecule?
[time=2298] Is it going to be those that ate the apple or Roger? Is Roger Williams going to be in heaven with a bite out of his right shoulder?
[time=2308] You can see the tremendous problems of this whole belief in the resurrection, and there are those who want to say, "It can't work, let's just dismiss the whole thing."
[time=2317] In 1637, the emperor of Japan gave an order that every Christian was to be executed, and in one grave alone are buried 11,111 Christians.
[time=2331] And they were all executed by being decapitated, and their heads were buried in a completely different grave so that none of them could be resurrected.
[time=2341] The missionaries had done such a fine job of teaching about the resurrection that they thought, "Well, if we put their bodies over there and their heads are over there, they can't be resurrected."
[time=2351] Once again, no resurrection possibilities.
[time=2356] There was a second question. Not only how is it possible that heads over here and bodies over here can be resurrected, but the second question is, "What kind of bodies do they come?"
[time=2369] I mean, if a child dies as an infant, will it inherit eternity to be forever in diapers? That doesn't sound like heaven to most mothers, I know.
[time=2381] Or, what if somebody dies tragically and their body is disfigured?
[time=2389] Will they have that mar disfigured body forever in heaven?
[time=2394] So you see, these were questions that were being raised, Paul knew it, and so he writes down the question, and he gives his answers.
[time=2403] He gives two answers. The first is an answer to the will, and the second is an answer to the mind.
[time=2412] Now, quite often, questions are raised that aren't actually questions, they're really objections.
[time=2420] Let me give you two classic examples. The first example is this.
[time=2425] Is God all powerful? Yes.
[time=2429] Then could God make a rock that is so big, so enormous, so heavy that nobody in the world, not even God, could pick it up?
[time=2438] Now, if you say yes, God could make a rock that big, you're saying God's not all powerful because he can't pick it up.
[time=2445] And if you say no, God can't make a rock that he can't pick up, then he's not all powerful because he can't make the rock.
[time=2452] Or this one. How many angels can dance on the head of a pin at one time?
[time=2461] The answer to that one is quite simple, they don't dance, none.
[time=2466] Now, let's be honest. There's probably no one who has ever lost a night's sleep pondering that deep concerning question
[time=2477] as to the number of angels that could dance simultaneously on the head of a pin.
[time=2483] And yet those type of questions are thrown around, asked again and again.
[time=2488] Why is that? It's because you or me, whenever God is putting a demand on our life to repent of our sins and to receive Christ a Savior,
[time=2501] the heat is on. The Bible calls it conviction, and none of us like conviction.
[time=2509] And so what we do is we start smokescreening. We start raising questions, hopefully the person sharing Christ with us won't be able to answer the question
[time=2519] saying ah, I got you. And I don't have to believe because you couldn't answer my questions.
[time=2526] And you see, those aren't questions that say I want to know. Those are questions that say I don't want to know.
[time=2534] These are questions not being raised by someone who wants to know, but by someone who thinks they already know.
[time=2541] And there are objections of the will as much as they are questions of the mind.
[time=2545] So Paul gives one answer to the will and another answer to the mind.
[time=2549] His answer to the objection of the will is one word. He says fool.
[time=2554] Now, Paul wasn't a name caller. When he used that word fool, it meant someone who was ignorant.
[time=2561] Someone who was without knowledge, somebody who had missed the whole point.
[time=2568] There are two other appropriate passages of scripture for us to consider when we hear that word fool.
[time=2574] The first one is found in Psalm 53 verse 1 where it said the fool has said in his heart there is no God.
[time=2586] And secondly, Proverbs 9-10 which says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[time=2594] Knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
[time=2599] You see, these questions were foolish because they started with a reference point that excluded God.
[time=2609] Now let's admit, if you exclude God, the resurrection is very, very difficult.
[time=2614] If you take a closed naturalistic system that says we are all the product of time plus space plus chance,
[time=2620] this evolutionary scheme and there is no God, there is no power, then that resurrection is a little bit hard to swallow.
[time=2628] But that's the foolish beginning because the beginning of wisdom is God.
[time=2633] And when you start with God, the resurrection is quite believable.
[time=2638] Couldn't he who spoke the world into existence speak again recreating our dead bodies for eternity?
[time=2646] Yes, he could.
[time=2648] Couldn't the God who summoned the great fish to restore Jonah's body to life summons again from the grave and bring our bodies back to life?
[time=2660] Yes, he could.
[time=2662] Couldn't he that called Lazarus out of the grave, restoring his decomposed body speak again calling each of us on resurrection morning restored?
[time=2674] Yes, he could.
[time=2676] Couldn't he who broke the grip of death on Easter morning break it again for every one of us when that trumpet sounds?
[time=2684] Certainly he could.
[time=2686] You see, these questions are all very answerable when you start with God, but without him they are enormous problems.
[time=2696] These were for some questions but for others objections.
[time=2700] You know, we call them the life of Jesus.
[time=2702] They constantly came at him with questions not that they wanted to know the answer but they wanted to try to trap him into a box and say,
[time=2710] what's this Jesus? No, he couldn't even answer our question. discount everything else he has to say.
[time=2716] In Matthew 22, first the lawyers came, then the scribes, then the Pharisees, then the Herodians.
[time=2722] Every one of them with a trick question, not that they wanted to know.
[time=2726] They simply wanted to push Jesus aside but they could not.
[time=2732] Now Paul gives for those who really did have a heart to know not just an answer to the will, foolishness,
[time=2739] but an answer to the mind.
[time=2741] And he does that initially by giving to us three illustrations from nature.
[time=2747] Found first of all in verse 36 it says, "Thou fool, that which thou soest is not made alive except it die,
[time=2754] and that which thou soest thou soest not the body that shall be but a bare grain."
[time=2760] It may chance of weed or of some other grain, but it pleases of God.
[time=2766] But God giveth it a body as it pleases with him and to every seed its own body.
[time=2773] He uses first an illustration from agriculture, from plants.
[time=2779] He talks about a seed and the fact that that seed ultimately gives rise to a stock of wheat or of corn
[time=2787] or a soybean plant to be appropriate for us Hoosiers.
[time=2791] And he makes three illustrations. First illustration he makes is when you take that little seed
[time=2797] and you put it in the ground it has to die before it can give rise to a living plant.
[time=2805] And so our bodies have to die so they can give rise to a living resurrected body.
[time=2812] Secondly, there is a big difference between the seed that is planted and the plant that grows.
[time=2818] Now, I don't know anything about farming.
[time=2822] But most of us who are not farmers do know something about dandelions.
[time=2827] First of all, we know that they are very expensive to get rid of.
[time=2831] We go out and we spread this fertilizer around in this weed killer.
[time=2835] And then our kids go out just when they are going to blossom and pick them all up and say, "Daddy, look at this!" And they blow the seeds all over the yard.
[time=2844] Well, those little seeds, white and fuzzy and cute to a five-year-old, they don't look anything like a broad leaf yellow blossom dandelion.
[time=2855] But they will give rise to one.
[time=2858] And he is simply saying, "Our physical bodies are not identical to our resurrection bodies.
[time=2864] They are just the seed. You plant it and something different comes up." Third thing he says out of this illustration is though they are different yet they are similar.
[time=2873] Verse 38 it says, "But God giveth it a body as it had pleased him and to every seed its own body."
[time=2879] If you plant corn, you don't need Jimmy the Greek to tell you it will be corn that will grow.
[time=2885] If you plant rye, it will be rye that will grow.
[time=2889] Every seed reproduces the same thing.
[time=2893] There is difference between the seed and the stalk, but yet there is similarity as well.
[time=2898] And so our resurrection bodies are going to be different yet similar to our physical bodies.
[time=2905] Now he changes the illustration.
[time=2907] He now goes through the illustration from the plant kingdom to the animal kingdom and he gives four different creatures there.
[time=2913] Human beings, then he uses animal and we by that think of a more traditional animal like a cow or something like that.
[time=2921] And then he goes to birds and to fish and all of those are flesh, every one of them.
[time=2926] But yet not all flesh is the same flesh.
[time=2930] Rose beef doesn't taste like turkey.
[time=2934] And when was the last time you saw a chicken cackling around the farm with gills are fish swimming with feathers?
[time=2941] They are all different and yet they are flesh.
[time=2945] Similar yet different.
[time=2948] Our physical bodies and our resurrection bodies are similar yet different.
[time=2955] Then he gives this third illustration.
[time=2958] It's an illustration that comes from the heavens.
[time=2961] He says there is a sun and there is a moon and there is all these stars in the glory of the suns different in the glory of the moon.
[time=2968] The glory of the moon is different in the glory of the stars.
[time=2971] And this keeps statement verse 41.
[time=2976] And the glory of the stars is different from the moon for one star differs from another in glory.
[time=2984] Again he is saying they look similar but they are different.
[time=2988] But what is amazing is from the human eye standpoint you take the sun and the moon and everything else looks the same.
[time=2996] Our human eye can't tell the difference between a star and another star or this star and the planets.
[time=3003] They all look the same.
[time=3004] We called today Venus the morning star because it looks so much like a star.
[time=3009] And yet Paul without the aid of a telescope that didn't come until the 1500s with Galileo said every one of those stars is different.
[time=3018] And he was absolutely right.
[time=3020] Modern astronomy tells us how different every star is.
[time=3026] I think God slipped that one little statement in.
[time=3030] To help those of us who are part of this modern technological age to see that the scriptures are written not by the pen of a man but by the spirit of an all knowing God.
[time=3044] And he has given us some time barriers that are broken.
[time=3052] In space and time Paul knew nothing of the differences of stars but the God who made them knew they were different.
[time=3059] And put that into the word of God so that you and I as modern people would say marvelous is God's word.
[time=3066] It must be true for tells us of things no man could have ever known only God.
[time=3073] And Paul's point is this the stars are all similar and yet they're different.
[time=3079] And the bottom line conclusion is our resurrected bodies what are they going to be like?
[time=3084] They're going to be similar to our bodies but yet they're going to be different.
[time=3087] How so? Now he gives four contrast.
[time=3090] The first is this verse 42.
[time=3095] So also is the resurrection of the dead.
[time=3098] It is sown perishable or corruption and it is raised in perishable or in corruption whichever translation you have.
[time=3107] So the first comparison is our physical bodies are perishable but our heavenly bodies are not.
[time=3115] Perishable refers to that which is decaying, dying, ultimately destroyed.
[time=3122] We bought a lot of fruit during the holiday season and a lot of fruit was given to us and we had one little basket over in the corner we forgot all about.
[time=3131] You don't want to do that with fruit for ten days.
[time=3134] If any of you are short penicillin stop over we've got plenty.
[time=3138] It's growing on the oranges.
[time=3141] It's perishing. Our bodies are perishing.
[time=3146] No matter how old or how young we are we're all in the process of decaying.
[time=3152] Do you remember when you used to go out back and throw the football round to get a workout?
[time=3156] Now watching the Browns beat the Jets is more workout than you can handle.
[time=3161] Remember when you used to jog up and down the stairs and now you're asking directions to the elevator?
[time=3168] We're all growing older. Even those of us who are young and our bodies are still growing actually we're already in the process of decay and dying.
[time=3180] Dr. John Wickham illustrates it this way. Take a ball and if I throw that ball up in the air as soon as it leaves my hands it's on its way down even though it's on its way up.
[time=3192] Because the thrust is over and it's going to be just a matter of time before that energy starts to fail and it comes down.
[time=3204] Do you ever notice even in the middle of life how much easier it is to put on fat than it is to put on muscle?
[time=3211] And how much easier it is to lose muscle than it is to lose fat? It's part of the process.
[time=3219] We're all perishing. Ultimately that process of perishing takes over and we die.
[time=3228] It's the aging process. One of the older members of our church who's in this service this morning we came down the hallway together and I said how are you doing today?
[time=3236] And he said pretty good with a push. We all need that. We're all perishing.
[time=3244] Those new heavenly bodies they're going to last forever. They're not going to decay. They're not going to get tired.
[time=3249] They're not going to get old. They're not going to get diseased. The eyes aren't going to have to squint to read the fine print.
[time=3255] They're not going to perish. Second description he gives is not only are they not going to perish.
[time=3261] These physical bodies are sown in dishonor but they're raised in glory.
[time=3268] We as a nation worship and honor those who are attractive and beautiful.
[time=3274] But you know the most attractive and most beautiful of us still have our flaws.
[time=3280] We still have our weaknesses. We still perish and we still die.
[time=3285] Even those most beautiful people who we see on movies and television we think they're so attractive they really aren't that attractive.
[time=3293] A number of years ago I lived in California was given some tickets to the Bob Hope Desert Classic.
[time=3298] We drove out into the desert and it rained. I'm not kidding you.
[time=3302] We drove out the Palm Springs were in the middle of the desert and it rained for two days.
[time=3307] We're sitting around the 18th hole watching the golf tournament.
[time=3312] And my friend Obos points two people down one row over and says do you know who she is?
[time=3318] No. And he gave her name and I didn't know who she was but he said she's the star of this television show.
[time=3326] I looked at her without her fancy hairdo, $500 wardrobe and makeup and perfect lighting.
[time=3334] She didn't look any better than the rest of us.
[time=3337] But we say oh what honor no there's no honor to our bodies.
[time=3342] And the greatest frustration is our bodies were made to glorify and honor God and sin has such a grip on us.
[time=3349] We can't even do that the way God wants us to do but not so with our new bodies.
[time=3355] They are going to be full of honor full of glory and full of power.
[time=3361] The third comparison he makes is that these physical bodies are weak but our new bodies are going to be strong.
[time=3371] Let's talk about weakness in two ways.
[time=3373] First of all physically most of us who are young don't think of ourselves as being weak but we are so weak.
[time=3378] The littlest thing can rob us of our strength.
[time=3382] You take a strong person and give him a little virus and they'll be laid low fast.
[time=3388] A number of years ago I had the privilege of meeting an outstanding professional football player.
[time=3393] He was retired living in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3397] John was only five foot eight but he was five foot eight by five foot eight by five foot eight.
[time=3405] And he was more powerful than a locomotive.
[time=3410] A group of us went canoeing one time.
[time=3413] Friend and I went over the 10 or 20 foot waterfall in our canoe and we went to the bottom tipped over
[time=3420] and the two of us struggled to get our canoe out of the water and shake the water out of it.
[time=3425] John and his girlfriend went over the water fall.
[time=3428] The canoe went into the water.
[time=3429] John picked it up, carried it out and shook it out and got back in.
[time=3433] He was strong.
[time=3436] But I met John because he had a terminal case of cancer.
[time=3441] And in the one year that I knew him, cancer took over his body and he needed help to put a little Vaseline on his lips.
[time=3453] No matter how strong we are, we're really pretty weak.
[time=3458] But John is strong again because he received Christ as a savior.
[time=3463] He's got a new body, a body that was better than the one that played in the NFL.
[time=3468] He's strong again.
[time=3471] Finally it says that we are given natural bodies and that's what dies but it's raised a spiritual body.
[time=3481] God says in the Psalms we're fearfully and wonderfully made and these bodies that he's given us are made and we're perfect here on earth but they're not suited for heaven.
[time=3490] That's why in heaven he gives us a new body that is spiritual, prepared for us.
[time=3512] We've been sharing with you the music ministry of our special guest, the life action singers that the message from the word of God from our pastor Rick Hawks.
