[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] There is a preacher of the old school, yet he preaches as boldly as ever.
[time=110] He's not popular, although the whole world is his parish and he travels every part of
[time=116] the globe and speaks every language.
[time=121] He preaches the people of every religion and no religion.
[time=127] He visits the poor and he calls upon the sick.
[time=131] The subject of his sermon is always the same.
[time=136] He is an eloquent preacher, stirring feelings that no other preacher could ever stir and
[time=142] bringing tears to eyes that have never wept.
[time=147] His arguments, none can refute, nor is there any heart that has remained unmoved by the
[time=154] force of his appeal.
[time=157] He shatters life with his message.
[time=160] Most people hate him, everyone fears him.
[time=164] His name, death, and every tombstone is his pulpit.
[time=171] Every newsprint is his text and some day each one of us will be his sermon.
[time=190] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoffs.
[time=193] We're glad you've chosen to spend part of your day with us.
[time=197] Today, Rick's message is entitled The Resurrection, Our Hope for the Future and Now.
[time=203] The grim reality of death can be overcome by the Lord's promise of eternal life.
[time=208] Christ's own resurrection is God's proof of our ultimate victory over death.
[time=213] Today, we will see that the resurrection is our hope for the future and now.
[time=219] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[time=224] We will be looking at verses 50 through 58.
[time=228] Special music for today's services will be provided by the sexual require.
[time=235] We'll also be hearing from Kevin Rowe and the Ben Singers Quartet.
[time=244] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=253] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=259] Now here's Rick.
[time=260] I want to say a word of greeting and welcome to the Bible Hour to our friends who are joining us from hospitals, their homes, perhaps prisons that today in this place and throughout the community we can share the fact that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=275] That the light of the world Jesus Christ is shining down.
[time=279] One of the joys of this Christmas season was to hear a great song of faith called Shine Down.
[time=285] A song that speaks to the fact that God shines his light down on each one of us.
[time=289] We hope that today, if never before, you have experienced the light of the love of Christ
[time=296] that you experienced that today.
[time=298] Our choir leads us in a hymn of worship, Shine Down Your Light on Me.
[time=315] Shine Down Your Light on Me, Let the people see that in Your presence darkness please,
[time=327] Father of light, Shine Down on Me, Shine Down Your Light on Me, Let the people see that
[time=338] in Your presence darkness please, Father of light, Shine Down on Me, Father of light,
[time=350] Shine Down on Me, You have sent us your glory in the life of Your only Son, and in Your
[time=359] presence the light of the Spirit shines the light of the ever-lastly one, a light that
[time=368] He's reaching to the people of every life that He's longing to fill the heart of every
[time=379] life that Shine Down Your Light on Me, Let the people see that in Your presence
[time=390] darkness please, Father of light, Shine Down on Me, Shine Down Your Light on Me, Let the
[time=401] people see that in Your presence darkness please, Father of light, Shine Down on Me,
[time=409] Father of light, Shine Down on Me, Bring us into Your presence, where Your love is
[time=423] the only light, the left of salvation, the hope that He's always shining bright, His
[time=433] shatters of darkness, swept away by your mighty hand, held in nations and worship, fingers
[time=445] off of the chorus well, hallelujah, glory to the man, thanks and honor, strength and
[time=460] love, dear to You, the great I am, dear to You, the great, just from Your light on Me,
[time=471] Let the people see that in Your presence darkness please, Father of light, Shine Down on Me,
[time=502] what a great message to share with the world that the light of the world has come, our
[time=521] heavenly Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, you can but look and live, look and live, my brother live, look to Jesus, him number 360, we'll sing the
[time=532] first, second and fourth Standses together, join us please, all together as we sing.
[time=562] [MUSIC - 101 seconds]
[time=680] There are times in our lives when we look to material things that we assume will allow us to prosper in years to come and will be our support in our strength and then circumstances
[time=691] allow us to have some setbacks and we're really not always aware of what's going to happen in the years to come.
[time=698] We can however trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and know that once we accept Him as our personal Savior we will have eternal life and when our name is written in the Lamb's book of life that assures us that we'll have that joy of fellowshipping with the Lord in heaven.
[time=712] Our special music today first of all is Kevin Rowe and he's going to be singing in a few minutes about the joy of Jesus Christ and the love that we can have in our hearts and the
[time=723] assurance that Christ has written our name in the book of life if we've accepted Him as our personal Savior and Kevin Rowe is now coming.
[time=733] I thought maybe he wasn't back there but he is.
[time=735] Let's listen to him now as he ministers to us.
[time=738] Very few are born to riches, very few.
[time=766] If you are ever famous, very few.
[time=778] But that won't matter much at all, on the day your name is called when this earthbound
[time=786] life is through and your Father says of you.
[time=796] This one was born in Zion, make no mistake, this one is mine, this one was born in Zion,
[time=815] this one will never, this one will never, this one will never die.
[time=832] Very few are ever famous, very few at all.
[time=845] Very few will ever live the dream that they choose, but that won't matter much at all,
[time=861] on the day your name is called when this earthbound life is through and your Father says of you.
[time=875] This one was born in Zion, make no mistake, this one is mine, this one was born in Zion,
[time=892] this one will never, this one will never, this one will never die.
[time=904] And every dream left unfulfilled and every worthy goal is just a shadow of the joy that
[time=916] waits forever to unfold, this one was born in Zion, make no mistake, this one is mine,
[time=940] this one was born in Zion, this one will never, this one will never die.
[time=970] Thank you for joining us again today for the Bible hour, this is a new year and I'm excited about what God has for us in this coming year.
[time=978] Rick we've had a lot of music but we have a lot of great events that take place throughout our year and my wife and I are looking forward to going to a seminar that's not really all that involved in music but has biblical overtones to it.
[time=990] That will be exciting, Pete's referring to a walk through the Bible seminar that we're hosting here on January 30th and 31st and I have to admit that if I had to today put
[time=1001] the whole Old Testament together I would have a difficult time doing that.
[time=1005] I'm sure that's true with me too, Rick.
[time=1007] I had a similar seminar when we were on the West Coast not by the same company but it was really exciting to see the Old Testament come to life and I'm sure the walk through the Bible seminar is going to be an outstanding exercise in knowing for sure what took place in the Old Testament in the chronological order.
[time=1024] That's one of the things that many of us have difficulty.
[time=1026] We can put the kings of Israel maybe in order that we know Saul was first and David's second
[time=1032] and then Solomon but where does Ezra and Nehemiah fit into that and then where do the prophets Amos and Obadiah come together and yet it's important to have an understanding of the chronology and the Old Testament how it all fits together.
[time=1046] Jesus said if any man would do his will meaning his the father he should know the scriptures and we want to invite you to be a part of this seminar on January 30th and 31st.
[time=1057] That's a Friday night and a Saturday morning.
[time=1060] You could come for the evening on Friday and then Saturday we start about 8 30 or 9 o'clock in the morning and it ends at 1 o'clock.
[time=1067] It won't take your whole day but it will give you a whole overview of the Old Testament.
[time=1071] If you would like information on that you could either write to us here at the Bible hour or call the church office and the address is 7 3 2 1 East State or the phone number
[time=1084] is 7 4 9 8 5 2 4.
[time=1087] We'd love to have you right to us or call us either one for information on the Bible seminar.
[time=1093] The same people who do this provide us with timeless insights which I think is a very helpful tool.
[time=1099] If that's another tool that certainly gets us into the Word of God and gives the all of us an opportunity to read the scriptures on a daily basis it really doesn't take that much of your time.
[time=1109] If you're just disciplined to read a little bit every day you'd be surprised how quickly you can read through the entire Bible.
[time=1116] That was to work out well that the walk through the Bible seminar is the Old Testament and timeless insights is the New Testament.
[time=1122] If you're struggling getting into God's Word on a consistent basis or getting something
[time=1128] out of the Word when you're getting into it timeless insights could be exactly what you need.
[time=1133] We'll send you your first copy free if you'll write to us and it serves as a daily Bible study guide taking you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=1142] It asks you to read about a chapter a day and then gives you some timeless insights from great men of the faith such as John Wesley or his brother Charles Wesley, Martin Luther
[time=1152] or A.B. Simpson.
[time=1153] If you would like a copy simply write to us here at the Bible hour Pete would you give them our address please.
[time=1159] Yes, we'd like to encourage you to write for timeless insights today.
[time=1163] Simply write to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1171] That's the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1177] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service I would like to share with
[time=1183] you friends in the South Bend area that my wife and I are going to be at the Trinity Evangelical Free Church on Friday night February the 6th for our biblical seminar on dealing
[time=1194] with doubt and discouragement.
[time=1196] The church is located on the crossroads of Miami and Roosevelt and the meeting will be at 7 o'clock in the evening.
[time=1203] We'd love to meet many of you and encourage you to be a part of that biblical seminar.
[time=1207] We'll remind you about that again next week.
[time=1211] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible hour as we go back to the morning worship service we're going to hear from our men singers, a male quartet that's going to encourage us with a song that let us know that God is the one who's always there that He never changes
[time=1226] and He is there for you to come to Him today.
[time=1229] Then if you don't have your Bible would you get it right now and open it to 1 Corinthians 15 that we can study the scriptures together to find out our hope for the future and for
[time=1239] now.
[time=1245] The life is moving faster than it ever has before.
[time=1265] What tomorrow brings us isn't certain anymore.
[time=1271] So many paths from which to choose don't know which way to run cause every road leads nowhere.
[time=1282] Every road except for one prays the Lord.
[time=1294] He never changes, I come to Him, He's always there.
[time=1307] He comforts me on every level, Tastes the burdens that I bear, prays the Lord.
[time=1323] He never changes, He's never any other way and He'll be the same tomorrow as He was and
[time=1344] He is today.
[time=1354] Friends and faces come and go like ashes in the wind, and a truth arise that I don't
[time=1364] understand, the things that you can cut upon grow fewer every day, but when the number
[time=1377] gets to one that one will show the way, prays the Lord.
[time=1390] He never changes, I come to Him, He's always there.
[time=1403] He comforts me on every level, Tastes the burdens that I bear, prays the Lord.
[time=1420] He never changes, He's never any other way and He'll be the same tomorrow as He was and
[time=1440] He is today and He'll be the same tomorrow as He was and He is today.
[time=1463] Father, we've come today to rest in those unchanging arms and to praise you for the
[time=1485] song that these men would sing, it reminds us that you are the same, and Father, we need
[time=1492] today to know of that steadfast character supporting our lives.
[time=1498] We would pray that the unchanging character of you, our God, would support those today who are going through the difficult adversities of life.
[time=1507] We pray today for Marv Dagetz as he battles an unknown enemy that attacks his body and
[time=1514] weakens it.
[time=1515] We thank you for the strength of his own mind and heart, the determination of his own character
[time=1521] and his partner in life, Hazel.
[time=1524] Father, we rejoice with those who have had victory.
[time=1528] We are thankful that Peter Davis is home from the hospital.
[time=1532] We pray today for those who are battling an enemy like cancer, for Catherine Northrop
[time=1538] and Kila Garten, we pray that the treatments that they're going through will be effective.
[time=1542] We pray today for Nancy Patti that you would strengthen her body as she recovers from surgery
[time=1549] and Brian Gerlach.
[time=1552] Father, we would pray today for families, we are thinking of those who are today struggling
[time=1559] husband against wife, women who fear the one that promised to provide for them and protect
[time=1565] them, men who find there's no love from the one who promised to love and to cherish them.
[time=1572] And yet, God, we thank you for those marriages that you've restored in this past year.
[time=1577] Those are damaged relationships that you've healed between fathers and sons and daughters.
[time=1583] Father today, we would pray that you would encourage each one of us through your word.
[time=1588] We would pray today for the outreach of our missionaries, particularly for Ken and Alice Cole as they planned a new church in Manila and for Ken's health.
[time=1598] We would also pray for Dave and Ed Southwell as they in the Portugal 2020 plan endeavor to
[time=1604] plant twenty churches in twenty years outside of the capital city of Portugal.
[time=1610] We would pray today for our many servants in Bangladesh for Ruth and Bobby and Jimmy and
[time=1616] Larry and Nancy.
[time=1617] As that country begins to shut its doors more and more to missions, we pray that you'll make effective their work.
[time=1624] We'd pray today for Hong Kong as the lease is up and the opportunity for missions may be dark in the future that you'll give effectiveness to those who are working there today.
[time=1636] Yet, God, for this church, we pray that your hand would be upon it, that you would teach us now through your word, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1650] There is a preacher of the old school, not very popular, though his whole world is his
[time=1657] parish, he travels every part of the globe and speaks every language.
[time=1663] He visits the poor and calls upon the rich.
[time=1668] He preaches to people of every religion and those of no religion.
[time=1673] The subject of his sermon is always the same.
[time=1679] He's an eloquent preacher, often pulling feelings out of people who never expressed them before, causing tears to come from eyes that have never wept.
[time=1690] His message, none can refute.
[time=1694] More can any stand against the persuasive eloquence of his appeals.
[time=1702] He shatters life with his message.
[time=1707] Most people hate him.
[time=1709] Literally everyone fears him, his name, death.
[time=1716] And every tombstone is his pulpit, every newspaper is his text, and someday, each of
[time=1725] us will be his sermon.
[time=1730] But thanks be unto God who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[time=1735] It's no wonder that death has been called the Grim Reaper, because apart from Christ
[time=1741] is exactly that, the Grim Reaper of lost souls.
[time=1746] But the apostle Paul looked into the face of death and said, "Thanks be unto God through
[time=1753] Jesus Christ, our Lord." If you have your Bible, open it with us for a time of study today in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verses 50 through 58.
[time=1765] These verses come as the climax of all that Paul has been teaching, both the Church of
[time=1771] Corinth and us today, about the resurrection of Christ.
[time=1776] It's a crescendo.
[time=1778] For those of you who do not know that term, a crescendo is a musical term.
[time=1783] It speaks of an orchestra or a choir that begins very soft and very slow, very subtle,
[time=1790] but the music gradually builds to a point of dominance and then to a climax with loudness
[time=1796] and energy and intensity to the man's attention.
[time=1800] Paul began teaching very clearly about the facts of the resurrection, the logical implications
[time=1806] of denying the resurrection, the implications positively of the resurrection, the nature of our resurrection body, and now it's as though he comes to a victory shout, "Thanks be unto God." Those I read these verses for you, beginning with verse 50.
[time=1822] Now this, I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither
[time=1830] does corruption inherit in corruption.
[time=1834] "Behold, I show you a mystery.
[time=1839] We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[time=1853] be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed.
[time=1858] For this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality.
[time=1866] So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put
[time=1873] on immortality, then shall be brought to the past, the saying which is written, death
[time=1879] is swallowed up in victory, oh, death where is thy sting, oh, grave where is thy victory?
[time=1890] The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law, but thanks be to God which
[time=1898] giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ, therefore my beloved brother, be ye
[time=1907] steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know
[time=1917] that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[time=1923] As the grim reaper is not the ultimate victory, the victory in the end belongs to Christ and
[time=1933] all who belong to the Lord.
[time=1936] In this passage, Paul brings everything he's been teaching about the resurrection down to some very practical, encouraging remarks.
[time=1944] He's going to give us here our hope for the future and our hope for now.
[time=1949] To begin with, he gives us our hope for the future.
[time=1951] Look at verse 50, it says, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither
[time=1958] does corruption inherit incorruption.
[time=1961] When he thinks of our hope for the future, he gives us four thoughts.
[time=1964] The first is this, death is but a door.
[time=1968] It's not doom, it is but a door.
[time=1970] He says that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1975] Now a lot has been written about what flesh and blood is, whether that's some reference to our old nature or if it's a reference to sin, I really have come to a rather solid
[time=1986] conclusion that flesh and blood means flesh and blood.
[time=1991] This stuff here.
[time=1992] What you and I are made of, a little bit of muscle, a little bit more fat, some broken down cartilage, some bones that don't flex the way they used to, are bodies.
[time=2002] I believe the Bible saying these bodies are not designed for heaven.
[time=2008] Heaven is a completely different place, it's a completely different order of nature and our natural bodies will not be suited for heaven.
[time=2018] In the verses we looked at last week, he compared fish, birds, human life and said we're all
[time=2024] different because we inhabit different areas.
[time=2028] Just think what it'd be like if right now the law was passing, that we now had to live like birds and every one of us had to live in the trees, wouldn't work.
[time=2037] If you were out of your tree already, that wouldn't do.
[time=2042] Our bodies aren't made to live in trees, they're made to live right here on the earth and because they're made to live right here on the earth, they're not made to live up there in heaven and aren't you thankful?
[time=2053] Those of you who are over 30, have you noticed any differences in your body since you were
[time=2059] 20?
[time=2063] Somebody's noticed a few.
[time=2067] I have a friend and I said how tall are you and he said I used to be 6 foot, now I'm about 5'10, the last 10 years have been hard on me.
[time=2075] Now just think of that, we do shrink you know that, what it is, all these bones are settling,
[time=2081] the muscles aren't strong to hold them in place, the cartilage and the ligaments are breaking down.
[time=2086] Now if you had to use that body you're in for the next 2000 years, could you imagine what it would look like?
[time=2093] You would not only be 6 foot, you wouldn't be 5'10, we'd be saying hello how are you down there?
[time=2099] These bodies aren't made for eternity, all of us need a retread about every 40,000 miles.
[time=2106] And the Bible is simply saying here, these bodies were not made for that place that we call heaven and flesh and blood cannot inherit heaven.
[time=2118] And so death is the doorway that God takes us through, these bodies die, our souls go
[time=2126] to heaven and on the resurrection day God brings these old bodies back as brand new
[time=2132] remade bodies that aren't made of flesh and blood but are made to inhabit eternity.
[time=2139] And death isn't doomed, it's simply the doorway that God must take us through.
[time=2146] I've never talked to a butterfly.
[time=2149] Some of you have, let me know, we have a counseling center.
[time=2153] But if you were to talk to a butterfly they would probably say to you that they did not enjoy their days as a caterpillar.
[time=2163] They couldn't fly, they weren't beautiful, they couldn't get away from danger but that
[time=2169] was a natural process that they went through.
[time=2173] Death is the natural process that God takes us through, they take these bodies as good or bad as they may be and then bring them through the doorway of death into a brand new form of existence that will be suitable for heaven.
[time=2187] Because flesh and blood can't inherit it, neither can corruption and our bodies like our old pipe are rusting, they're deteriorating, they're falling apart, we're not made for heaven.
[time=2199] And so the resurrection is our hope for the future that God's going to remake these old bonds.
[time=2205] Second thing he says is this, while it appears that therefore everybody has to die, not everybody is going to die.
[time=2212] Look at verse 51, "Behold I show you a mystery." Now a mystery is a truth that God is revealing that he's never before revealed.
[time=2221] He says, "I'm going to tell you something new, we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[time=2228] be changed." Now some have hung that over the nursery, we will not all sleep but we all be changed.
[time=2237] There are some deeper theological implications than that.
[time=2243] Sleep is obviously a euphemism for death, I'll bet you've said it, trying to comfort a bereaved family at a funeral home, you've noticed their dead love when you said why he looks like he's just sleeping.
[time=2255] We like to hide the harsh realities of death and sleep is a euphemism that we often use.
[time=2262] And an appropriate one for a believer because as a believer dives, their soul goes to heaven and their body is in a sense sleeping because it's going to wake up one of these days.
[time=2272] As the Negro spiritual put it on that great getting up morning, temporarily it is sleeping.
[time=2278] Paul here says, "The mystery is that not every believer is going to die, but every believer
[time=2285] will be changed." Now this passage has its parallel 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, stick your church bulletin right
[time=2293] here in chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians and go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4.
[time=2301] The apostle Paul is talking about this same event and to give it a name we call it the rapture.
[time=2306] The word rapture as I've shared with you before simply is a Latin word that means the snatch to steal the seas.
[time=2313] Verse 13 said, "But I would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning those who are asleep, those who have died, that you sorrow not even as others who have no hope.
[time=2324] For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus
[time=2330] will God bring with him.
[time=2333] For this we say unto you, by the word of the Lord that we who are alive and remain at the
[time=2339] coming of the Lord shall not precede those who are asleep.
[time=2343] For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall be raised first.
[time=2353] Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
[time=2363] These two passages both talk about this event that we call the rapture.
[time=2367] At one point in the future we don't know when but Christ will come again to the clouds and he will call forth all believers, dead will rise their bodies and living will rise.
[time=2381] So not everyone will go through the door, we have death, nearly everyone except for the terminal generation, they won't die.
[time=2389] And it's described this event in three ways.
[time=2392] The first way it's described it says it'll happen in a moment.
[time=2396] The Greek word for moment is pronounced in English atum, A-T-O-M.
[time=2402] It's made up with two other words, not actually words, but a prefix, the letter A which negates
[time=2408] whatever follows.
[time=2410] If you're a moral person that means you have character.
[time=2412] If you're an A moral person that means you do not have morals or character.
[time=2417] The little letter A negates what follows and the word that follows the T-O-M stands for
[time=2425] a word that means divideable or breakable.
[time=2429] And so the word atum means that which is so small it cannot be broken.
[time=2434] Isn't it interesting that long before Einstein, long before our generation, even before Christ
[time=2441] the Greeks believed in what they called the atomic theory, they weren't running around dropping bombs on people.
[time=2448] By atomic theory we mean they recognized that all material substance was made up of infinitely
[time=2454] small little particles so small that it could not be broken.
[time=2459] Now what's this have to do with in a moment?
[time=2462] It is saying that when Christ comes again it will happen in an instantaneous moment so
[time=2469] brief a period of time it cannot be divided smaller than a nanosecond.
[time=2474] Christ is going to come and he's going to take dead and living just like that.
[time=2480] I've seen movies and artist renditions of the rapture and they're all fine but they
[time=2486] picture these graves slowly and mysteriously opening and these bodies coming out and it
[time=2492] looks like they're in a time warp or they're in slow motion and they're going to heaven and then one goes out of this car and the pilot out of this airplane goes isn't going to be like that.
[time=2501] It's going to be boom, gone, done, Christ is come, is raptured to dead and living saints
[time=2507] their bodies and souls are united and they're gone in a moment.
[time=2511] It's also described in the twinkling of an eye.
[time=2514] Some of you come from those real small towns.
[time=2517] The towns that if you blink you missed it, you know the town council saved money.
[time=2522] I put one pole in the ground and it said welcome and goodbye was on the same sign.
[time=2527] You know when those brief little stops that's how quickly this is going to be.
[time=2532] If you blink your eye you would have missed it.
[time=2535] If you've heard the old expression the hand is quicker than the eye, it's not.
[time=2540] It may be more deceitful than the eye but it's not quicker.
[time=2544] Probably the fastest human reflex that you have is the blinking of your eye and that's
[time=2550] how quickly Christ will come.
[time=2552] Thirdly, it's described as when the last trumpet will blow.
[time=2558] We know in the book of Revelation God has seven trumpets that are going to blow and that's going to be far after this trumpet.
[time=2564] This isn't the last time a trumpet will ever be blown in history.
[time=2567] It's actually a military term.
[time=2570] When the Romans build a camp they might stay there for any length of time but a certain blowing of the trumpet meant that they were to strike their tents and prepare to move.
[time=2580] The second blow of the trumpet meant that they were to be done and to line up and the third or final blow of the trumpet meant begin marching.
[time=2588] The final trumpet is when Christ comes in a moment in the Twinkling Eye and he blows that trumpet and he said ready march I'm taking you home to be with me.
[time=2599] When God speaks about our home in heaven and our hope he said first of all don't be afraid
[time=2605] of death.
[time=2606] It is not due.
[time=2607] It's the doorway that I'll take you through.
[time=2610] Secondly, not everyone's going to die.
[time=2612] Jesus could come today.
[time=2614] Right after the Cleveland Browns beat the Broncos he could come.
[time=2619] We have a lot of Buckeyes here.
[time=2622] Now if the Browns are behind then he may come before the end of the game.
[time=2629] Now that's really what the rapture is meant to be.
[time=2631] It's meant to be our hope in the face of tribulation.
[time=2635] All of us are going to go through personal tribulations but the whole world is going to go through a catastrophic tribulation that it's never known before but your hope in mind is that Jesus will come like that in a moment and the twinkling of an eye before
[time=2651] disaster strikes us he'll rapture us out of here.
[time=2655] That's our hope.
[time=2656] Here's our third hope.
[time=2658] It says this we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed verse 53 for this corruptible
[time=2664] must put on in corruption and this mortal must put on immortality whether we're dead
[time=2670] or whether we're alive at the moment of the rapture all of our bodies are going to be transformed.
[time=2678] Just as God translates them from heaven to earth he's going to transform them from physical bodies to spiritual bodies from bodies that are corruptible to bodies that are incorruptible from bodies that are mortal to bodies that are immortal we're going to be transformed.
[time=2695] Benjamin Franklin had this put on his tombstone.
[time=2699] It reads like this in a cemetery of Christchurch of Philadelphia.
[time=2704] The body of Franklin printer like the cover of an old book its contents torn out and stripped
[time=2711] of its lettering and gilding lies here food for the worms but the work will not be lost
[time=2718] for it will appear once more in a new and more elegant edition revised and corrected by the
[time=2724] original author.
[time=2726] That's what God's going to do he's going to take these old bodies he's going to revise them correct them and take them to heaven to be with him will all be changed.
[time=2736] Our fourth and final hope not final as though the message is over in case you've got your hopes out.
[time=2741] Our fourth and final hope under our hope for the future is this victory will ultimately
[time=2749] be won over death.
[time=2752] When look at verse 54.
[time=2757] So when this corruptible shall have put on in corruption and this mortal shall have put
[time=2765] on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written death is swallowed
[time=2774] up in victory.
[time=2776] This is though this is an ongoing contest an ongoing war an ongoing athletic event and
[time=2784] Jesus Christ has scored the ultimate points when he died on the cross from our sins and rose again but the contest is not over and the enemy death continues to strike a blow
[time=2797] here and there as this one dies and then that one and still another and the ultimate victory
[time=2803] of Christ has not yet been realized.
[time=2806] When will it be realized when he comes again and he totally resurrects our dead bodies
[time=2813] and then death reigns no more.
[time=2820] As you look at these next verses we might phrase it this way.
[time=2824] Three stings and death is out.
[time=2827] Verse 55.
[time=2828] The death where is thy sting, O grave where is thy victory?
[time=2834] The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law.
[time=2839] Herein we find three enemies three stings but three victories death.
[time=2849] The words here translated death and grave are the same word Thanatos.
[time=2856] Death is one enemy but death sting is only the power that it gets from sin because if
[time=2863] you or I never sinned then we would never die.
[time=2866] So the real sting of death is another sting which is sin and you know sin would have no power in our lives if there wasn't a law that said thou shall or thou shall not.
[time=2877] So there are the three stings death sin and the law.
[time=2885] Many of you are studying the book of Romans and the adult Bible fellowships all of you should be.
[time=2892] In that study of Romans you'll discover in chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 that Christ had victory
[time=2900] over death, had victory over sin, and he had victory over the law.
[time=2905] And this is though God the eternal umpire said three stings and death is out.
[time=2912] This is the recipe of the God who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=2916] Dr. Dihon explained it this way.
[time=2920] He said that he used to keep bees and he took his two sons out to the beehive and one big bee got after the boys and stung the oldest brother right in the forehead and then went
[time=2930] after the youngest brother who was crying and screaming.
[time=2934] Dihon said, I told my youngest son you don't need to be afraid, a working bee can only sting one time and your older brother already took the sting and that bee can't hurt you
[time=2950] anymore.
[time=2953] Jesus our elder brother our Savior already took the sting of death and that bee can't
[time=2962] hurt us anymore.
[time=2966] All that Paul has been teaching us about the resurrection was designed to lead us to have
[time=2972] confidence for our hope for the future that death is but a door.
[time=2979] Not something to be afraid of but it's a doorway that God will take us through.
[time=2983] Secondly not all will die.
[time=2986] Thirdly all of us will be changed and fourthly that there's a victory over death that will
[time=2994] ultimately realize.
[time=2997] In the last two verses he is turning back to a very practical section.
[time=3001] He doesn't want us just to have heaven and eternity on our mind and wants to talk about life today and how the resurrection is our hope for life today.
[time=3009] Verse 57 says, but thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3017] This can be very accurately translated who continues our keeps giving us the victory.
[time=3024] You see Christ not only was victorious over sin the law and death one time he is continually
[time=3031] victorious over all of those things because his power is in us today.
[time=3038] He keeps on giving us the victory.
[time=3042] Even if you will to chapter three of the book of Philippians we're in first Corinthians second
[time=3048] Corinthians Galatians Ephesians Philippians Philippians chapter three and verse nine.
[time=3056] You also Paul wrote these words.
[time=3059] I want to be found in him Christ not having my own righteousness which is of the law but
[time=3069] that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith
[time=3076] that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering
[time=3082] being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain under the resurrection
[time=3088] of the dead.
[time=3089] What Paul was saying there was this he said I so want to die to myself and my own righteousness
[time=3098] and sin in the law that Christ lives in me and the life that I now live is empowered
[time=3104] by the resurrection of Christ.
[time=3107] And that's what he meant in verse fifty seven when he said thanks be unto God who keeps on giving us the victory Christ not only died in the past to give us victory in the future every day he wants to give us victory over sin victory over the law and victory over death.
[time=3123] He's got power available to us.
[time=3125] As Charles Wesley wrote he breaks the power of canceled sin he sets the captive free.
[time=3131] His blood can make the vilest clean his blood avails for me long my imprisoned soul said
[time=3142] in sin's night but his eye diffused acquitening Ray I awoke my chains were gone my heart was
[time=3154] free I arose went forth and followed the that's the power of the resurrected Christ that's
[time=3160] available and God gives us that power because he has a plan look at verse fifty eight therefore
[time=3167] it's not only a grammatical conjunction a word of conclusion but it's a word of application because of the power of the resurrection how ought we to live therefore my dearly beloved
[time=3180] those who were like family brother those that were dear to him beloved be he steadfast that
[time=3190] word steadfast actually means to be seated not as though somebody quit and they walked over and they said I'm done I quit and many of us do that in the Christian life we said
[time=3200] I've had enough I quit doesn't mean sit down and take a break the word to be seated means to be settled to be in position and the Bible is saying that because of our faith in Christ
[time=3213] we ought to be seated settled with our feet planted knowing exactly what we believe why
[time=3221] we believe it and not given to moving over here because we heard somebody say that we
[time=3227] never heard that before so maybe that's true and then we overheard on the radio somebody else had a different plan and then a new church was starting and and they had some new doctrine and always moving toss to infrow now be settled turn to Ephesians chapter four one book prior
[time=3246] to Philippians where we were a moment ago Ephesians chapter four and verse fourteen that
[time=3254] we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about by every wind of
[time=3261] doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness by which they lie and wait to deceive
[time=3268] but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him and all things who is the head even Christ God's will for your life is that he gives you resurrection power so that you can
[time=3280] solidly position yourself as steadfast secondly almost similarly it says unmovable steadfast
[time=3296] actually means you positioning yourself unmovable means resisting those who would like to push
[time=3302] you or shove you into a different direction someone who is unmovable someone who doesn't budge on their beliefs or compromise on their convictions someone who's unmovable knows
[time=3313] what they believe and when it's challenged congraciously say I don't believe that I really
[time=3319] believe what the Bible says are someone who's when they're pressured to compromise their convictions can look into the face of popularity and say no my convictions lead me not to compromise
[time=3332] someone who's unmovable and then finally someone who is always abounding in the work of the
[time=3340] Lord you know most of us are like the back of a box of cereal we want to know what the daily minimum requirements are what is it that God expects of me what is it I have to do
[time=3352] to get by this passage says we're not supposed to do the minimum but the maximum we are always
[time=3358] to abound in the work of the Lord not what is it I have to do but what can I possibly do
[time=3364] what is my greatest opportunity and then to go for it then he gives a logical reason why
[time=3371] should we do that for as much as you know that your labor your work of the Lord is not
[time=3378] in vain a lot of vain things in our life that are important at one point and later we see
[time=3385] how ridiculous they are after four years of swimming I had collected all of my trophies
[time=3391] and awards and strategically placed both of them on a shelf I remember I was a high school
[time=3398] graduate and came home from Taylor University as a freshman I used to like to look at those and reminisce and think about the race when it was in the awards ceremony when it was getting out one of those things were really important about five years after that my parents said he's never coming home we got to remodel this into a den and they said what do you want us to do with all these old trophies and stuff you want to come pick them up and I said come pick up that junk pitch it I'm not going to drive Indiana and pick up a box of junk and haul it around I've got no place to put it it's just old high school stuff pitch
[time=3432] it isn't amazing the number of things in life that we hold to so dear it's so important
[time=3439] we've got to have it a few years later we say ah pitch it doesn't matter but there's
[time=3447] some things in life that will matter for eternity you've heard the old expression it says it so well only one life will soon be passed only what's done for Christ will last
[time=3461] may I close with this question what will you do with Jesus neutral you cannot be someday
[time=3475] your heart will be asking what will he do with me what would you do with Jesus if you've
[time=3486] never before received him a savior today would you open up your heart to him admit
[time=3492] you're a sinner and ask his forgiveness if you'll do that he will come in
