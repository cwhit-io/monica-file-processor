[time=0] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=104] Vision is that rare quality of having an eye for the future.
[time=109] Solomon said in the book of Proverbs that where there is no vision, the people perish.
[time=116] In describing his brother, Senator Kennedy said, "Most men look at things the way they are and say why." My brother dreamed of things that never were and said, "Why not?"
[time=130] Vision. Do you have an eye for the future?
[time=134] [MUSIC]
[time=145] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=151] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=153] Today, Rick's message is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 16 and is entitled "Always Abounding in the Work of the Lord." Vision, having an eye for the future, is essential to the growth of any church
[time=167] and for that matter, our individual lives.
[time=170] So that you are able to study with us, please locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=177] We will be looking at verses 1 through 12.
[time=180] We will be hearing special music today from our sanctuary choir.
[time=185] Denise Mitchell, and second generation.
[time=192] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=198] in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=203] We pray that the Lord will use this worship service to minister to you.
[time=208] Now here's Rick.
[time=210] It's a privilege to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=215] We trust that today this service brings glory and honor to the name of our God and of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=223] We hope that we do that not just through the singing of the choir and the singing of the congregation, not just through the study of His Word but by the very attitudes of our heart.
[time=234] God says that we must worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[time=239] It's more a matter of the heart than it is what we do outwardly.
[time=243] And so we hope today that your heart is prepared to worship the Lord.
[time=248] Our choir leads us in worship with an anthem of praise of Hebrew flavor.
[time=253] He is Jehovah.
[time=255] And if your attitude isn't ready to worship the Lord now, it will be in just a moment.
[time=260] He is Jehovah.
[time=290] He is the great I am.
[time=297] The God of Abraham.
[time=300] Jehovah, Shalom.
[time=302] The God of peace I am.
[time=305] The God of Israel.
[time=307] The everlasting one.
[time=309] He is Jehovah.
[time=311] The God that we would be.
[time=314] Saint Alleluia, Saint Alleluia, Saint Alleluia, Saint Alleluia, Saint Alleluia.
[time=329] He is the Holy Ghost and He is the Holy Ghost and He is the Holy Ghost.
[time=340] He is your Almighty, Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah, God of salvation, God of Messiah.
[time=350] The Holy Ghost and He is the Holy Ghost and He is the Holy Ghost and He is the Holy Ghost.
[time=358] (singing in foreign language)
[time=416] (applause) - The beauty of some of the songs we sing
[time=424] is the power in it, and then the joy to sing.
[time=426] God is our provider, our healer, the balm of Gilead, the prince of peace.
[time=433] We sing of the almighty power of God in hymn number 32.
[time=437] We'll sing the first and third stanzas together, number 32.
[time=443] (singing in foreign language)
[time=503] [MUSIC - 18 seconds]
[time=531] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=533] Appreciate the leadership of the choir and our accompanist, Darlene Johnson and Dennis Kirschner, as they work from week to week, leading us in our worship together through song.
[time=544] Denise Mitchell comes now to sing about the glorious dwelling place that the Lord has provided for us.
[time=551] And I hope that your heart is set on desiring to be in that dwelling place.
[time=556] As Psalm 27.4 says, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, "that will I seek after that I may dwell "in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, "to behold the beauty of the Lord "and to inquire in his temple." Let's draw near to the Lord as Denise sings.
[time=572] (gentle music)
[time=589] [MUSIC - 220 seconds]
[time=814] Again, we want to welcome you today to the Bible Hour.
[time=832] I trust that what's already taken place has been a special encouragement to your heart.
[time=838] I particularly like the song that Pete and the choir provided about God is our Jehovah and our provider.
[time=844] Joining Pete and I this morning is a good friend of ours, Dr. Marvin Eastland.
[time=848] Good morning, Marv, how are you?
[time=850] - Just fine, Rick.
[time=851] - Good, thank you for getting up early on a Sunday morning and joining us.
[time=855] Dr. Eastland is a specialist, as a doctor, tell 'em a little bit about your practice.
[time=860] - I'm a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, presently doing gynecology only in my office because of an illness that I've had and I've been very busy at that.
[time=871] - I remember a time that you practiced obstetrics at least three times.
[time=874] - Yeah, that's right with your wife.
[time=876] - And we certainly appreciate your caring spirit along with professional skill when each of our children were born.
[time=882] - Thank you.
[time=883] - We've asked Dr. Eastland to join us today because he's a part of a very special program that's coming up next Saturday that we wanted you to be informed about.
[time=892] It's a very important movement of the pro-life movement.
[time=896] - We as believers have a responsibility to teach what God's view of life is and God's view of prenatal life.
[time=903] Marv, you have had a long-term interest in abortion issue, tell us just a little bit about that.
[time=908] - I've, of course, in my specialty deal a lot with the unborn baby and this has always bothered me to see the ability to kill this baby willingly.
[time=924] Abortion just does not make sense to me.
[time=926] And because of that, I've spoken out, I've written editorials and this year I've been asked to be the keynote speaker at the right to life march that is coming up this next Saturday.
[time=937] - Well, we would be pleased to have you here at any time but particularly with this march coming up and the speaking that you'll be doing to try to stir our community's interest in protecting the life of the unborn child.
[time=949] This, I believe, is the 14th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion and opened up a gate that flooding of abortion has poured through.
[time=961] And we as believers have a responsibility to teach what God's word has to say.
[time=965] Tell us a little bit about the rally and what you'll be speaking about.
[time=969] - The rally will be held on the next Saturday, the 24th.
[time=974] It starts at noon with a march at the city county building.
[time=979] The march ends up at the Scottish right around one o'clock at which time there'll be approximately an hour program where I'm speaking part of the time on the issue of abortion.
[time=991] I plan to talk along the topic of exposing the truth about abortion and exposing some of the scientific knowledge that is already available that speaks out loudly against this atrocity.
[time=1005] - Well, I don't want to ask you to give your speech now and steal all of your thunder, but could you just give us one little taste of what you're talking about when we say the scientific knowledge that's available in speaking the truth?
[time=1016] - Well, we're commanded in the Bible to speak the truth.
[time=1021] And the science of today, our technology, has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that life exists at the very moment of conception.
[time=1031] And the taking of that life is murder.
[time=1035] And I plan to pull out some of the knowledge that is already available and then challenge the people who write about abortion, especially in the press and in the media, who tend to write in the pro-abortion stand instead of the pro-life stand to give us equal time and to expose the truth about this issue.
[time=1057] - Well, I certainly appreciate you not only being here this morning, but being a consistent spokesman for the unborn child, the right of that child, and then more importantly, speaking with the word of God in truth, and I appreciate that.
[time=1070] - Thank you, Rick.
[time=1071] - Let me just remind you of that date.
[time=1073] It's next Saturday, January the 24th, and there's a march at 10 o'clock, and then a rally at one o'clock at the Scottish Rite Auditorium at which Dr. Eastland will be the speaker.
[time=1084] And I want to add my encouragement to all that's been said this morning for you to come and be a part of that rally at Scottish Rite Auditorium.
[time=1092] Pete has a copy of Timeless Insights, and would you just share about that ministry with our guests?
[time=1098] - For several months now, we've been advertising the monthly pamphlet entitled Timeless Insights, and we'd like to send you your first copy, absolutely free, if you'll write to us, Timeless Insights at the present time is studying the book of John, and there are some great riches in that book.
[time=1112] After you read the scriptures and get some insight for that particular day, you'll also see some biographies, and in this case, it's A.W. Tozer.
[time=1121] We'd like to encourage you to read the Bible on a daily basis so that you can grow in your spiritual life, and we'd like to send you a copy of Timeless Insights.
[time=1129] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1138] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1146] - Thank you, Pete.
[time=1147] We do hope you'll write for Timeless Insights, and while you're writing, I would like to remind you that Bruce Wilkinson, who spoke here last summer, who so greatly challenged us, is the president of Walk Through the Bible Ministries, from which we get Timeless Insights.
[time=1163] And in addition to that, on January the 30th and 31st, we're having a Walk Through the Bible seminar.
[time=1170] We'd love to have you come.
[time=1172] It takes place on Friday night and Saturday morning.
[time=1175] If you would like to come and learn how to put the whole Old Testament together and a concise way and understand it, please come to this seminar.
[time=1184] If you'd like to register, you can write to us at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1193] And please do write quickly because the seminar is just two weeks away.
[time=1198] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, we have the opportunity of hearing from our youth group here called Second Generation.
[time=1205] And Dr. Eastling, your daughter, Shelly, is a part of that.
[time=1208] - That's right.
[time=1209] - Well, great.
[time=1210] We'll look forward to sharing that ministry with you right now.
[time=1213] [MUSIC - 416 seconds]
[time=1651] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1661] That was great.
[time=1663] Thank you, Second Generation and Heather in particular.
[time=1667] That's what our praises to God today.
[time=1670] We're not what God ultimately wants us to be.
[time=1673] We, everyone, are still marked with sin.
[time=1676] There's no super Christians here.
[time=1679] We're not what we're someday going to be.
[time=1682] But it's still true that we're not what we used to be either.
[time=1686] That Christ has come into our life and he's changed us.
[time=1690] And that's worth thanking him for.
[time=1692] God, we do thank you today that we're not what we used to be.
[time=1698] We don't pretend by that Lord that we're better than anyone else, but we just know that we've been forgiven.
[time=1704] And we thank you because you've done it, we haven't.
[time=1708] You've given us a new life and we thank you.
[time=1711] And we ask you by your spirit to work in our lives today, to make us less like what we are and more like what we ought to be.
[time=1720] And as the song said, Father, we want to be made fully alive in your spirit.
[time=1725] God, take our lives that are clogged and slowed down, burdened with the cares of this world and liberate us.
[time=1736] And set us free by your spirit.
[time=1738] Give us a spiritual mind that looks beyond the cares of today in this life.
[time=1744] Father, release us from the shackles of bitterness and greed.
[time=1749] The anger of bitterness for things that have gone wrong in the past and the greed of wanting more for the future.
[time=1757] God, make us alive by your spirit.
[time=1760] Father, we pray that your spirit would give to us a sense of urgency to live for Christ and to share Christ.
[time=1768] Father, we pray that you would capture the heart and mind of students today, that with their youth and enthusiasm, they might have a purpose in serving Christ.
[time=1780] Father, we pray for those of us in the middle of life, as we're so involved with work and jobs and home and family that the very focal point of all of that activity would be Christ.
[time=1792] And Father, for those in the senior years, we pray that you would keep them fresh by your spirit.
[time=1799] Make them fully alive in your power.
[time=1803] Father, we pray today that you, as the God of all healing, would work in the lives of those who are physically suffering today.
[time=1811] We pray particularly for Lynn Grubart and Kila Garten
[time=1818] and Clarence Yokolat and Alberta Hires.
[time=1824] We pray that your hand would be upon them and strengthen them.
[time=1829] They walk through some difficult valleys in their health.
[time=1833] We pray that you would refresh their family members and strengthen them.
[time=1838] Thank you for friends that you bring into their lives and ours who are a real source of comfort and a representative of you and from you.
[time=1847] And now through your word, Father, we pray that you would strengthen us.
[time=1852] And as we study your word that it would give us a new perspective, we pray that you'll make of us great forgivers.
[time=1861] People who take the initiative to say, "I'm sorry." God help us to cope with when we're misunderstood or misrepresented
[time=1871] when our words are taken wrong or we said them wrong but didn't mean that.
[time=1876] God help us particularly as men to say words like, "I am sorry.
[time=1881] I love you. Will you forgive me?" God make of us a generous people and a visionary people.
[time=1892] What's in Jesus' name that we pray? Amen.
[time=1897] If you have your Bible with you, please open it to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=1902] For some of you, chapter 16 is the site of good news.
[time=1906] It's the last chapter of 1 Corinthians and we started studying 1 Corinthians
[time=1912] in September of 1985. That's a long time.
[time=1918] Some of you are shaking your head yes.
[time=1920] Let me tell you why we've taken such a long time to study this.
[time=1925] First of all, it's a long book. This isn't 3 John, which is just a few verses making one chapter. It's a pretty long epistle in the New Testament.
[time=1934] Secondly, this is an intensely practical book of the Bible.
[time=1938] It talks about life today in terms of morality and money.
[time=1943] It talks about contemporary issues that face our Christian life, like the do's and the don'ts and the charismatic movement.
[time=1951] It talks about eternity and the resurrection and our hope for heaven.
[time=1955] So practical that when Chuck Swindall preached his way through it, he changed it from 1 Corinthians to 1 Californians.
[time=1961] This is practical stuff.
[time=1964] And then the third reason why we do that is we really want to study the scriptures, not just use a verse to be a door opener to some topic and then give whatever our opinions are on that topic.
[time=1975] We like to study the Bible, verse by verse.
[time=1978] And so we've taken our time and you've been patient, but probably two more weeks and we'll end 1 Corinthians.
[time=1985] But let me read for you the last verse of chapter 15 and the first 12 of chapter 16.
[time=1992] 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 58.
[time=1998] "Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable,
[time=2005] always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
[time=2014] Now, concerning the collection for the saints as I have given order to the churches of Galatia,
[time=2022] even so do ye.
[time=2025] Upon the first day of the week, let every one of you lay up by him in store
[time=2033] as God has prospered him so that there be no gatherings when I come.
[time=2041] And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, then will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
[time=2052] And if it be suitable that I go, also, they shall go with me.
[time=2059] Now, I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia, for I do pass through Macedonia.
[time=2066] And it may be that I will buy ye and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey wherever I go.
[time=2075] For I will not see you now, by the way, but I trust to carry a while with you if the Lord permits.
[time=2085] I will tear you at Ephesus until Pentecost, for a great door and a factual is opened unto me,
[time=2094] and there are many adversaries.
[time=2098] Now, if Timothy come, see that he may be with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord,
[time=2106] as I also do.
[time=2108] Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct him forth in peace,
[time=2114] that he may come unto me, for I look for him with the brethren.
[time=2119] As touching our brother, Apollus, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren.
[time=2125] But this was not at all to come at this time, but he will come when he shall have a convenient time.
[time=2134] The last chapter, 1 Corinthians 16.
[time=2137] In some ways, this, like last chapters of other of Paul's letters, they get kind of homey.
[time=2143] He talks about friends of Paul, and Timothy.
[time=2146] In some of them, he becomes kind of practical, down to send Titus when he comes by way of my friend's house
[time=2154] and haven't picked up my coat.
[time=2155] I left it there and I'm cold.
[time=2157] I haven't heard any great sermons out of that text.
[time=2160] Is this just homey information?
[time=2163] I don't think so.
[time=2164] I think in these last verses, Paul is getting down to some practical applications of what he said in verse 58.
[time=2172] He builds them up to this great crescendo, talking about the resurrection.
[time=2176] Christ is coming in the moment in the twinkling of an eye, and he's got them on the edge of their eschatological seats.
[time=2184] And then he says, "Now wait a minute.
[time=2186] Don't get so futuristic in your thinking that today you fail to be steadfast, unmovable."
[time=2194] And then this phrase, "Always abounding in the work of the Lord." It's like the runner who is approaching the finish line.
[time=2203] The difference between a winner and a loser is the loser says, "Ah, there's the finish line.
[time=2207] I can slow down now." And the winner says, "There's the finish line." And he pushes it that much harder.
[time=2214] Paul wanted us to all be winning for Christ.
[time=2218] And when he said, "Be therefore steadfast, unmovable." He says, "In light of Christ coming abound in the things of the Lord." I feel like chapter 16 is some practical application of how to go about this somewhat nebulous description of abounding in the work of the Lord.
[time=2237] Throughout the chapter, there are a number of descriptions we'll give to abounding in the Lord's work, but this morning just these two.
[time=2245] First of all, the individual, that's you or me, or the group, that's us, the church that's abounding in the Lord's work will, first of all, be generous.
[time=2256] Chapter 16, verse 1, all of our favorite phrases of the Bible, now concerning the collection.
[time=2266] All of us get this little tingle in our back when they say, "And would the ushers please come at this time?"
[time=2273] All of us probably have some chagrin at offerings and discussion of money.
[time=2279] At least I do. I don't particularly enjoy the part of my job that is necessary, and that is representing the financial needs of a ministry.
[time=2289] But I have to admit to you, I somewhat enjoy it when we're simply studying through a book of the Bible and God has something to say about this practical area of money,
[time=2298] then we're simply studying it in context and really not trying to manipulate people.
[time=2304] There is always a eye of suspicion, a condescending view that's given to those that talk about money, one very popular television evangelist got himself into a little trouble this past week for how he was going about it.
[time=2319] Yesterday we had a deacons meeting, and I hope, humorously, they suggested that I might try the same tactic.
[time=2326] And so I just wanted to say something to you today that if I don't raise $3 million in the next two years for our new building, then Ray Tream, the chairman of our board is going to die.
[time=2342] It was his idea, so I thought that's where the application ought to go.
[time=2348] Oh, it's good to laugh because we feel so uncomfortable about money, and how we talk about money, or how someone else talks about money.
[time=2356] You remember the story of Flip Wilson's "Don't You" when he played the preacher, and he got the congregation all revved up, and he said, "This church is going to have to get up, and it's going to have to crawl for the Lord," and they all said, "Amen," and he said, "This church is not going to have to crawl for the Lord, this church is going to walk for the Lord, and they amend all the louder," and he said, "This church is not only going to walk, it's going to run, and they amend all the louder," and he said,
[time=2377] "If this church is going to run, it's going to take money," and they said, "Let her crawl. Let her crawl."
[time=2384] That's a tough subject for all of us to either talk about or swallow.
[time=2388] But here, let's just look at it for what God has to say.
[time=2391] We're not trying to raise money today for television, new building, church budget, missions.
[time=2397] Let's just look at the principles today, okay?
[time=2400] First of all, there was a particular purpose that Paul was addressing.
[time=2404] The purpose was found in verses 1 and 3, he said, "A collection for the saints." Particularly, verse 3 tells us in Jerusalem.
[time=2412] See, the church of Jerusalem was suffering greatly so for two reasons.
[time=2417] First of all, in general, Jerusalem had just gone through a famine.
[time=2421] How do we know that?
[time=2422] Lax chapter 11 tells us that there was a famine in the land of Israel in Jerusalem.
[time=2427] It was hard times for everybody.
[time=2430] But it was particularly hard time for believers in Christ because they were ostracized from the community.
[time=2438] Many of them were forced to leave their homes, to close their businesses, and they had nothing.
[time=2444] Acts 7 culminates with that persecution in the stoning and death of Stephen.
[time=2451] And Acts 8 tells us believers were simply scattered everywhere.
[time=2457] These were hard times for them.
[time=2459] And so the purpose of Paul's writing was that he was writing to the Corinthians to help support the church in Jerusalem.
[time=2468] And he said, "I'm not only writing to you, I've written to the churches of Galatia, and we'll find in Romans chapter 15."
[time=2474] He wrote to the church of Rome.
[time=2476] He did it all without a word processor, isn't that amazing?
[time=2480] That was his purpose.
[time=2482] And in sharing the purpose, he gives these three principles to guide our giving.
[time=2489] We've shared these before, so I'm going to cover them really fast and move on to new ground.
[time=2494] But the first is that it is to be regular.
[time=2498] It says, "On the first day of the week," he says, "it's up a pattern, a systematic program as to how we're to order our lives."
[time=2510] Sometimes we confuse two things that don't necessarily have an equivalency.
[time=2516] Spirit-ledness with spontaneity.
[time=2520] Now I believe the spirit can lead us to do things spontaneously, but I believe the spirit more often leads us to do things regularly.
[time=2528] You know, in our ministry, it takes right around 100 Sunday school teachers to take care of the children through the adult ministry.
[time=2535] And we need to know they're going to be there.
[time=2538] We can't say to you, "Would you like to teach Sunday school for the next quarter, 13 weeks?" Well, I'll do it every Sunday morning, the spirit leads me.
[time=2546] I'll let you know about 9.30 if the spirit's moving or not.
[time=2551] Wilbur, that just won't fly.
[time=2554] You see, God is really more able to use us, not based upon our abilities, but upon our dependabilities.
[time=2563] It's a lot easier to use someone who has little ability, but he's very dependable than it is used as someone, although she may have great abilities, but she's not the least bit dependable.
[time=2575] It's not only true of Sunday school teachers.
[time=2578] It's true of every area of life, including the area of giving.
[time=2583] He said, "On the first day of the week, take the money, set it aside, lay it up in store."
[time=2590] Now why did he say that?
[time=2592] In that economy, you got paid daily.
[time=2594] At the end of the day, the common labor got his wages paid, and many of them were subsistence livers, meaning they got their money, they went to the store, they bought their food, and they were basically broke.
[time=2606] So he said, "Every day, just lay up a little bit in store so that on the first day of the week, there, when the offering is taken, you can participate."
[time=2616] I believe the spirit can lead us to do some things spontaneously.
[time=2620] We got to call this past week.
[time=2622] Somebody wanted to know if I could come to Florida and speak for a week.
[time=2625] Boy, the spirit was leading fast.
[time=2627] Spontaneously, I wanted to say, "Yep, give me the dates." But you know what the spirit led me to say?
[time=2635] You've already got five commitments that week.
[time=2638] See the difference?
[time=2640] You may want to do something spontaneously, and that may be fine, but that doesn't make its spirit led.
[time=2645] The spirit will lead us in a systematic way, just as much as in a spontaneous way.
[time=2651] You know, usually when the spirit leads, it's the wrong spirit.
[time=2654] It's not the Holy Spirit, it's our spirit.
[time=2657] Many people get up on the morning like this.
[time=2659] They look outside, they say, "It's Sunday morning.
[time=2661] The roads are snowy.
[time=2663] It's coming down now.
[time=2665] Church is in a half-hour bar humbug." We'll watch the Bible hour.
[time=2669] I'm so thankful you came today, because the old spirit would have said, "Stay home." Spontaneously.
[time=2677] Giving is to be generous, and that'll be marked for one thing, on regularity.
[time=2683] Secondly, it'll be something that we see as a responsibility.
[time=2688] On the first day of the week, let every one of you.
[time=2693] You know, in Corinth, there were some wealthy merchants.
[time=2695] That was a Metroplex.
[time=2697] There were a lot of small cities.
[time=2699] This was the major city.
[time=2701] It was a commercial city.
[time=2702] It was a cosmopolitan.
[time=2704] There was a lot of money flowing through this city, and some of those merchants knew how to not only make it flow, but to make it stick.
[time=2712] It's interesting.
[time=2713] Paul didn't say, "Now, all of you who are merchants, who own your own business, who are in the high-income bracket, you folks really need to do something." He said, "Let every one of you." Jesus' most powerful teaching on money was when he zeroed in on a widow who gave such
[time=2731] a meager amount financially that it would cost more to mail in the gift than the gift was worth itself.
[time=2739] About 40 cents in today's economy.
[time=2742] You couldn't send the gift in and send back the receipt.
[time=2745] It cost 44 cents.
[time=2748] Jesus commended her for her generosity.
[time=2752] The Bible says every one of us has a part, and you may be able to give to the Lord's work, maybe the Portugal 2020 plan that they even have South War doing in Spain,
[time=2763] Portugal.
[time=2764] That's why they call it the Portugal 2020 plan.
[time=2767] You may be able to give $100,000.
[time=2770] That's great.
[time=2771] God bless you.
[time=2772] You may only be able to send a dollar.
[time=2774] Do you know what?
[time=2775] That's worth just as much in God's economy.
[time=2778] Every one of us have a responsibility.
[time=2780] The third principle is this.
[time=2783] It's to be given out of our resources.
[time=2787] There's a lot of debate.
[time=2789] How much are we to give?
[time=2791] There are some churches that teach 10% time.
[time=2795] That's God's standard.
[time=2796] Old Testament, New Testament.
[time=2798] That may be.
[time=2799] There are other churches that teach what they call a modern tie.
[time=2803] That's 5%.
[time=2804] Maybe there's some validity to that.
[time=2807] You know what?
[time=2808] I believe the Bible teaches.
[time=2809] I believe the Bible gives us nine different words in the New Testament for giving.
[time=2814] One of those is tithing.
[time=2816] But the only time the word tithing occurs is when it's the New Testament telling us what they did in the Old Testament.
[time=2823] And the tithe in the Old Testament, if it was a tithe of Israel, was a tithe of somewhere
[time=2829] between 20 and 25%, they gave two 10% tithes, and then a third tithe every three years.
[time=2837] However, that was not really a gift to God.
[time=2841] Those tithes were to support the religious and particularly the political structure of Israel.
[time=2847] Those were their taxes.
[time=2849] There was an awful lot of us who would be happy to have the church pay our taxes.
[time=2856] But that's not the plan.
[time=2858] The words in the New Testament that describe giving are words like grace.
[time=2863] Liberality, generosity, and I believe God is more concerned with the motive than the amount.
[time=2871] Because once the motive gets settled, the amount tends to grow rather quickly.
[time=2876] It says out of our resources, and to be quite candid and blunt, with very few exceptions,
[time=2883] all of us here have an abundance, an abundance.
[time=2891] Paul's principles were these.
[time=2893] Give regularly.
[time=2895] It's your responsibility to do it out of your resources.
[time=2899] Well, those were the principles, and he even gets into the procedure a little bit.
[time=2903] Two notes about procedure.
[time=2905] First of all, I like Paul for what he said at the end of verse two.
[time=2909] "That there be no gatherings when I come." It seems that Paul had an aversion to fundraising as much as the rest of us.
[time=2916] He didn't want to have to come in and be the fundraising guy.
[time=2920] He simply wrote to them ahead of time so they can be taken care of.
[time=2924] I like to think that why stewardship has a high element of anticipation.
[time=2929] There are no doubt in our ministry and in other ministries crises that occurs.
[time=2936] But most of us schedule our lives, and we know what's happening,
[time=2942] and a little planning could allow information to be given before there's a crisis.
[time=2948] Paul said, "I'm writing to you now so that you can take care of it now so that I won't have to come in and say I'm going to be leaving in one week or in one month and we've got to do this great financial fundraising." We anticipated it.
[time=2962] And then secondly, he had demonstrated it.
[time=2964] He said in verse three, "Whomever you want to manage the money, you recommend them and we'll send the money with them.
[time=2971] If you want me to go, I'll go.
[time=2973] We'll make sure that this thing is properly administered." I think it's always wise that we take our money, give it to the Lord's work, and we know that it's going into ministry, that the money is going to go where we said it was going to go, administrative properly.
[time=2989] Well, the marks of, I think, this first characteristic of abounding in the work of the Lord is generosity.
[time=2998] Now a second mark, vision.
[time=3002] Now before you get confused, let me define the word vision.
[time=3005] I believe vision is an eye for the future.
[time=3010] Someone who not only assesses what needs to be done now, but someone who looks to the future and assesses the needs and the opportunity.
[time=3018] Paul was a great visionary.
[time=3021] In verses five through eleven, excuse me, five through eight, he tells us of his vision that come back to Corinth and to minister with them again.
[time=3033] As a matter of fact, Paul not only wanted to make it to Corinth, but in Romans 1, he told that church that he hoped to make it to Rome.
[time=3041] And then in chapter 15 of Romans, he said, "I want to make it to Spain." You know what Paul was really saying?
[time=3048] To Paul, the world was the Roman Empire.
[time=3051] The Eastern extremity would be Israel and Jerusalem.
[time=3055] The Western extremity would be Spain.
[time=3058] The central focal point would be Rome, and Paul had a vision.
[time=3062] He said, "I want to tell my world about Christ.
[time=3065] From shore to shore, from the least of the cities to Rome itself." He was a visionary, a man with an eye for the future.
[time=3076] And in this discussion about his desire, his goal to come to Corinth, I want to make these four notes about a visionary.
[time=3084] If you're a visionary today, first of all, you've got to have a plan.
[time=3088] And Paul had a plan to make it to Corinth.
[time=3091] Look at verse 5, he said, "I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for my plans do call on me to pass through Macedonia.
[time=3099] And it may be that I'll abide with you and winter with you." Remember the time you got a letter from your in-law coming for the winter?
[time=3107] I'm a winner with you that you may bring me on my journey wherever I go,
[time=3115] for I will not see you now, by the way.
[time=3118] What he's saying is, "I'm not just going to come see you for a moment.
[time=3122] Stop on the way somewhere else." He said, "I'm going to put together a definite plan, and here's my plan.
[time=3128] I'm going to go to Macedonia and Corinth on the same trip." For those of you that don't know geography, Corinth is in somewhat central or southern Greece and Macedonia is in northern Greece.
[time=3141] Paul's over an Ephesus in western Turkey, and he's saying, "I'm not just going to make a little boondoggle over and back.
[time=3147] I'm going to make a plan to visit all the churches in Macedonia and Corinth,
[time=3153] and then I'll stay for a while." A successful visionary is someone who can come up with a plan to get from point A to point B.
[time=3165] A visionary is someone who looks at opportunities and then goes for them.
[time=3172] Senator Kennedy, in eulogizing his brother, said this.
[time=3177] Some men look at things the way they are and say, "Why?" My brother looked at things and dreamed of things that never were and said, "Why not?"
[time=3189] That's a visionary.
[time=3191] It's absolutely critical that if we're going to go abound in the Lord's Lord, the Lord's work that we have a vision for the future.
[time=3199] William Carey said, "We've got a great God.
[time=3202] Therefore, we should expect great things from God and attempt great things for God."
[time=3210] An eye for the future.
[time=3212] Solomon in his wisdom and inspiration of God wisely noted, "Where there is no vision, the people will perish."
[time=3222] Churches die.
[time=3224] Sunday school classes die.
[time=3226] Missionaries, pastors, Christian workers die when there's no vision.
[time=3234] When nobody has their eye to the future.
[time=3236] When everybody looks at now and says, "I like it the way it is." Let's not make alterations for tomorrow.
[time=3244] The death of the church is this short phrase.
[time=3249] We've always done it this way.
[time=3253] A visionary dreams of things that never were and says, "Why not?"
[time=3261] But you've got to have a plan.
[time=3263] Secondly, if you're visionary, you've got to be flexible.
[time=3266] Notice the Paul said in verse 6, "It may be that I will come to you."
[time=3273] And then at the end of verse 7, he says, "If the Lord permits." Paul is so wise, he says, "Here's my goal.
[time=3281] Here's my vision.
[time=3283] Here's my dream, and I've got a plan, but I've got to put some flexibility in this." James says, "Woe unto you." Say, "Today we're going to do this, and tomorrow we're going to do this, because you don't even know that God is going to give you a tomorrow." Your life's been a vapor.
[time=3298] It could be gone tomorrow.
[time=3302] Many a visionary has developed a plan, but failed to live out their plan
[time=3308] because they didn't build into both their plan and into their personality flex ability.
[time=3315] Many people start off with great goals, great expectations, great drives, and they've got this plan, and the first time their plan runs into a snag they quit.
[time=3325] A visionary's got to be flexible to make mid-course adjustments.
[time=3330] A visionary's not only somebody who's a great starter, but somebody who's a great finisher.
[time=3335] In the Olympics, they do not give gold medals for those who are in first place at the halfway mark of the race, only for those who are in first place at the end of a race.
[time=3347] Those of us who are visionaries have a tendency to be quitters and start a new vision when we run into adversity.
[time=3355] Paul said, "I got some flexibility here.
[time=3358] I may come." It's a good thing that he was flexible because in 2 Corinthians 1, just one page later, he's writing an apology saying, "When I said I was going to come, I meant it.
[time=3368] I wanted to come, but I didn't make it. It just didn't work out.
[time=3371] It wasn't Lord's will." He said, "I'm not one of those guys that says just everything and then fizzles out." With me, yes is yes and no is no, but it just wasn't the Lord's timing.
[time=3382] Flexibility.
[time=3384] Thirdly, a visionary is someone who has an eye for opportunity.
[time=3390] Verse 9, "For a great door and a factual opportunity is opened for me."
[time=3398] Do you know we're surrounded by opportunities?
[time=3403] Daily to witness for Christ, to teach a Sunday school class, to sing, to join an E.E. class, to work for the Lord.
[time=3411] There's an opportunity around us all the time, but most of us don't have our eye trained.
[time=3418] You see the opportunity.
[time=3422] And then finally, a visionary will face adversity.
[time=3428] Great door of opportunity is open for me.
[time=3431] There are also many adversaries.
[time=3438] We've got great plans for this church.
[time=3440] We've got great plans for Manila 88.
[time=3442] We've got great plans for missions.
[time=3444] We've got great plans for family growth.
[time=3448] But we're going to face adversity and opportunity.
[time=3452] And that's the good news.
[time=3454] Say good news, sure.
[time=3456] You see, a church, an individual who's going nowhere will face no opposition.
[time=3461] It's only those who are going somewhere that the enemy will seek to oppose.
[time=3466] So count it all joy, my brother, when you fall into various trials.
[time=3470] Knowing this, the detesting of your faith works patience.
[time=3474] And let patience have its perfect work that you might be entirely complete.
[time=3480] Lacking in nothing.
[time=3484] The marks of abounding in the work of the Lord, the first two are these.
[time=3489] Generosity, secondly, visionary, and I for the future.
[time=3500] It's been a privilege today to share with you the special music from Denise Mitchell
[time=3516] in our high school ensemble second generation.
[time=3519] And then the message from our pastor Rick Hawks.

[time=3528] I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3530] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3533] Dear Heavenly Father, I want to thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3540] And today I know that there's a need in my heart for you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3547] I ask you to personally come into my heart today.
[time=3550] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3554] If you prayed this prayer with me, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3558] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
