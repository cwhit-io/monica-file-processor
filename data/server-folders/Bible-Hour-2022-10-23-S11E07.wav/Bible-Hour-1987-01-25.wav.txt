[time=109] There are several critical qualities of abounding in the Lord's work.
[time=114] One of those is a cooperative spirit.
[time=117] A number of churches have been planted around Fort Wayne.
[time=121] When one of them was being started, one of the men who was going to help start the church was asked by the pastor, "What do you think of the idea?" He said, "We hire pastors to lead us, and that's what they ought to do is lead, and we ought to follow them until they prove they can't lead, then you fire them." Well, beneath all that was a real hunger to cooperate abounding in the Lord's work.
[time=150] (bell chimes)
[time=161] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=164] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=166] Rick's message today is entitled Abounding in the Work of the Lord and is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=175] Generous, visionary, and cooperative are critical qualities of the individual or church that desires to always abound in the work of the Lord.
[time=186] Of course, that is God's will for each of us.
[time=189] Today's study is designed to help us abound in the work of the Lord.
[time=194] Please locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=198] We will be looking at verses 12 through 24.
[time=202] We will be hearing special music from the sanctuary choir,
[time=208] Marsha Ives, and Rejoice.
[time=214] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=223] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=228] Now here's Rick, joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=232] I look forward to being here each week and sharing God's Word with you, but this week in particular.
[time=237] Two things have me excited about being home.
[time=240] First of all, I was at a conference in Colorado and it was so encouraging to me that I just couldn't wait to get back and to be a part of this church.
[time=249] And then secondly, it took me four airports and seven airplanes and a bus to get home.
[time=253] So I'm really glad to be home too.
[time=256] As I was talking to some people in the airport and they were talking about their problems, I told them mine and they deduced that I was the problem, that I jinxed the airplanes, and they were talking about taking me and putting me off the plane and see if it would then work.
[time=269] Reminding me of Jonah and the whale, they figured out Jonah was the problem, they threw him overboard.
[time=274] At 30,000 feet, I'm glad they decided not to do that.
[time=278] It's always good to be here, but for me, particularly good to see you today.
[time=282] I hope that there's a spirit of expectation in your heart.
[time=285] To know God, and to know of His love for your life, He is a strong and mighty God whom we worship today.
[time=292] [MUSIC]
[time=303] He's strong in the Lord, and He of the courage, or defender, is He.
[time=315] Who is always the same, now done with means, as He of the standing.
[time=327] If free is sure when you walk on His name,
[time=334] be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord,
[time=342] and be of the courage, for He is your God.
[time=350] Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord,
[time=357] and rejoice for love in free His rules.
[time=369] Good on the armor, the Lord has strong lighted,
[time=376] and sure He builds in His unfairly clear.
[time=384] Trust Him for He will begin with you in battle.
[time=392] Mighty your hand to avoid every stare.
[time=398] He's strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord,
[time=406] and be of the courage, for He is your God.
[time=413] He's strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord,
[time=421] and rejoice for love in free His rules.
[time=430] Be strong in the Lord, and be of the courage,
[time=440] the mighty, the member will then face the foe.
[time=448] Fear on the battle, for love in free His always is.
[time=455] He will project you wherever you go.
[time=462] Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord,
[time=469] and be of the courage, for He is your God.
[time=476] Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord,
[time=484] and rejoice for love in free His rules.
[time=491] Be strong, be strong, be strong in the Lord,
[time=499] and rejoice for love in free His rules.
[time=506] Be strong!
[time=515] What a blessed privilege to write.
[time=520] We lie on the Lord regardless of our circumstances and be strong through Him and not of ourselves.
[time=527] Continue praising the Lord by singing together Him number 407.
[time=531] All the way, my Savior leads me.
[time=532] We'll sing all three verses, Him number 407.
[time=549] All the way, my Savior leads me.
[time=553] Lord, have I through as we sign, and I doubt His tender mercies.
[time=561] Good who lie, because in my God, Heavenly peace, in my His comfort, hereby faith in Him to dwell.
[time=574] For I know, for here we've called me, Jesus, do with all things well.
[time=593] All the way, my Savior leads me.
[time=597] Jesus, why we've got them?
[time=601] Yes, He prays for every trial.
[time=605] It's me with the living prayer.
[time=609] Though my weary steps may falter, and my soul at first may be.
[time=618] As He crown the rock before me, love us free of joy I see.
[time=638] All the way, my Savior leads me.
[time=642] Oh, the chorus of His love, perfect rest of me is promised, in my Father's house of love.
[time=655] And my spirit woe immortal, makes us fly throughout our day.
[time=664] This my song through endless angels, Jesus, may be all the way.
[time=685] Someday, life's journey will be or, and I shall reach that distant shore.
[time=690] I'll sing while entering Heaven's door, Jesus led me all the way.
[time=696] Again, what a great thrill it is to put our trust in Jesus, and to allow Him to have the music come forth from us because of His salvation and the Holy Spirit dwelling within us.
[time=707] Listen to the music now of Marsha Ives as she comes to sing for us, a song that's entitled, "Jesus Is My Music." Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=740] My life was out of tune and happiness eluded me.
[time=747] My life was dissonant and missing in her harmony.
[time=754] But then I met the Savior and received His gift of grace.
[time=761] And now my heart sings melody.
[time=769] [MUSIC - 175 seconds]
[time=972] Hello again and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=976] We hope that this time together is something that will strengthen your faith and encourage you in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=983] Hello Pete, how are you this morning?
[time=985] Good morning Rick.
[time=986] You mentioned the folks getting strengthened in their faith and I hope they are receiving encouragement each week and I'm sure that you received some encouragement as you went to the pastors conference this week.
[time=996] I really did.
[time=997] I had the privilege of being a part of a select group of pastors who were brought together to exchange ideas on how to sharpen our focus on the ministry and that was great.
[time=1007] Everything was tremendous except for the flight home.
[time=1009] I understand that that wasn't a direct flight.
[time=1012] No, I've been to four different airports and on seven different airplanes and missed four of them but I'm home and I'm glad.
[time=1019] Rick, we've been talking for several weeks now about the walk through the Bible seminar that we're going to have this weekend.
[time=1024] That's going to be an exciting event.
[time=1026] Well, I'm looking forward to that and we want to encourage you and invite you to join us for the walk through the Bible seminar on the Old Testament.
[time=1034] It's this coming Friday night and Saturday, January the 30th and 31st where you friends
[time=1040] in Marion and South Bend, it's already happened but for you friends here in Fort Wayne you have the next few days to plan on being a part of a walk through the Bible seminar.
[time=1049] What we'll be doing on this seminar is explaining the whole Old Testament from the book of Genesis
[time=1055] through the book of Malachi in an exciting, dramatic way that will help each of us and I did say us because I need that help to understand how the Old Testament fits together.
[time=1066] If you could possibly come on Friday night and Saturday from nine to one in the morning or one in the afternoon, we're not going to keep you up to one in the morning.
[time=1074] For those four hours you'll have a great opportunity to understand the Old Testament.
[time=1078] Pete, I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1081] While I had just a little taste of that several years ago in California with a similar type project and it was very worthwhile, helped us put into perspective the chronological order of the events of the Old Testament.
[time=1092] If you would like to be a part of this year's walk through the Bible seminar, you can either call the church office at 749-8524 at number again as 749-8524 or you can simply come at
[time=1107] 7 o'clock Friday night and register at that time.
[time=1110] It would be a big help to us if you could call but if you can't, please feel free to come.
[time=1115] We'd love to have you as a part of this seminar.
[time=1117] The cost is $25 for a couple or $12.50 for an individual and I know that it will be money
[time=1123] well spent in strengthening your understanding of the Scriptures.
[time=1127] Walk through the Bible comes to us in a variety of ministries, not only the seminar but timeless insights.
[time=1133] We've been offering again timeless insights for several weeks and we feel that it's a very fine magazine for all of you to use on a daily basis.
[time=1142] There's a short scripture portion that really helps you understand the New Testament and God's Word for you on a daily basis.
[time=1150] One of the things people often tell me they struggle with is how to consistently study God's Word.
[time=1156] As a matter of fact, I'll be in South Bend in a few weeks and that's one of the things they wanted to talk about was studying God's Word.
[time=1163] I don't know of a better plan than timeless insights.
[time=1165] It takes you through the New Testament in one year and it gives you a daily guide.
[time=1170] Too many of us read the same passages again and again and again because we like those but we don't grow by hearing the same thing over and over.
[time=1178] So this gives you a systematic guide.
[time=1180] It also gives you some applications as to not only I read it and I think I understand but what do I do with this?
[time=1186] It applies it to each of our lives.
[time=1189] If you'd like an introductory copy, please write to us today and we'll send you one free.
[time=1194] You can receive a copy of Timeless Insights by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000,
[time=1200] Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1205] That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1212] Thank you Pete and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1215] I hope that you'll stay with us as we go back to our morning worship service and that together we'll grow in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1232] We'll be back to our morning worship service.
[time=1257] He is forever and ever and ever will cease our never-ending, ever-lasting peace.
[time=1276] Mountains may crumble and fall after all what are they, but He is a joy that endures.
[time=1289] We are sure He will say He is forever and ever for time can't destroy.
[time=1297] He is the song of joy, He is forever and ever and time can't destroy.
[time=1305] Our never-ending, ever-lasting joy.
[time=1314] Praise the Lord, He will never cease.
[time=1318] Praise the Lord, He is joy at peace.
[time=1330] We are like castles of sand and now we stand super cold.
[time=1339] But He is the love that we live, He is the love that we change, He goes on.
[time=1346] He is forever and ever a father above, He is the heart of God, He is forever and ever a
[time=1357] father above our never-ending, ever-lasting, ever-ending, ever-ending, all.
[time=1370] Praise the Lord for He reigns above.
[time=1375] Praise the Lord for never is love.
[time=1381] Praise the Lord for He reigns above.
[time=1385] Praise the Lord for never is love.
[time=1391] He is God.
[time=1406] Thank you, ladies, that is encouraging to hear that shouting forth, they are praising the Lord.
[time=1411] God, we do come to praise you today.
[time=1415] We want your lives to glorify your being on this first day of the week, God.
[time=1420] We are starting a new week and we want to start it with you.
[time=1423] We want to start it praising you.
[time=1427] Father, though many of us have been believers for weeks or months or in most cases, even years, today we make a fresh start.
[time=1436] We surrender to you.
[time=1438] We look forward to this new week with anticipation and God make our lives to count for eternity,
[time=1448] help us to do more at the end of this month and to balance the budget of the church or our family checkbook.
[time=1455] God make us to have an impact for Christ, give us sensitivity to the people who really
[time=1462] want to know who you are and help us to express Christ in love.
[time=1470] Make us win some, Lord, we love you and we love people.
[time=1475] We so desperately want people to know you.
[time=1481] So Father, we commit ourselves afresh today to serving you and to serving one another.
[time=1489] God make us a growing church, not just in numbers, but in lives that have an impact
[time=1495] for Christ.
[time=1498] God, through your word today, we want to know you, we want to know your will, we want to
[time=1506] know it all personally.
[time=1507] God, make this hour more than just a vague study of academics, make it a session in
[time=1514] life.
[time=1515] We ask you to enrich and encourage us.
[time=1521] We might abound in your work, we know it's not in vain.
[time=1528] Father of many today need a special nudge to get off their point of apathy.
[time=1538] Some of us need a swift kick and we'll be vulnerable today and ask you to do that.
[time=1544] Lord, you know that there are still others that need a gentle stroke.
[time=1550] When we ask you to today help them to sense the tender hands of a tenderhearted God, particularly
[time=1559] those who are walking through some deep valleys of separation and divorce, others with critical
[time=1566] health problems, others with strain in their family that they just don't know how to solve.
[time=1576] Gently stroke that Lord.
[time=1581] Bring revival.
[time=1582] Not sensationalism, just quiet revival into our hearts, into our homes.
[time=1590] Make us alive for Jesus' sake.
[time=1595] [AMEN] If you have your Bible, please open it if you would to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=1604] Last week we began talking about the church or the individual that's always abounding
[time=1612] in the work of the Lord.
[time=1614] That individual who is steadfast, unmovable, always abounding.
[time=1623] Last week we gave two qualities of that church or that individual.
[time=1628] The first one was that they're generous, that there are people who give, who give of their lives, who give of their financial resources, who give their very hearts to people.
[time=1639] Paul gave some principles about generosity in verses 1 through 4.
[time=1643] And if you want to have an impact for Christ, do this one thing, give yourself away.
[time=1651] There's an excellent book not really written from a Christian perspective called Whatever Became of Sin.
[time=1658] It talks about the secularization of our society and how in the vague realm of morality there are no absolutes.
[time=1665] So this man writes whatever became of sin.
[time=1669] This man is actually a secular behaviorist.
[time=1675] And he gave as his number one cure for depression this advice, if you're depressed, the best
[time=1682] thing you can do is go lock your back door and walk out your front door and go give yourself
[time=1688] away to somebody else.
[time=1691] Depression causes us to be so focused in on ourselves and our problems that it becomes a death trap.
[time=1697] So lock the back door and walk out the front and give yourself away to somebody else.
[time=1702] You know, that's exactly what Jesus said, be generous with our lives.
[time=1707] He said, "Whosoever would keep his life, the same will lose it." And whosoever would lose his life for my sake in the gospels, they'll find it, generosity.
[time=1718] A second quality we talked about last week was vision.
[time=1722] Solomon said, "Where there is no vision, the people perished." I want to ask you to join me in a difficult exercise with me.
[time=1730] You're going to have to talk to one another.
[time=1731] If you didn't do that when we gave you a chance to earlier, you've got to do it now.
[time=1735] Once you do a little brainstorming together, here's the question and you share an answer with the people around you.
[time=1742] What do you think is the average attendance in 50% of the churches like ours in America?
[time=1750] No, by a church like ours, I mean a church that believes the Bible to be God's Word.
[time=1756] And a church that's committed to reaching out to people and bringing them to Christ.
[time=1760] Now, what do you think the average attendance is in America?
[time=1765] All right, now share that with your husband or wife.
[time=1768] If you're not with your husband or wife, you're next to somebody who's single and you're single and you'd like to get to meet them, then just go meet them, invite them to lunch, but find out what they think.
[time=1777] Found that out?
[time=1779] Good.
[time=1780] A little brainstorm.
[time=1781] Now, by average, maybe average isn't the right word.
[time=1784] Maybe I should use the word mean attendance, not that the people will go there are mean, just when you start at one end or the other, you come to the middle.
[time=1791] All right, have you done that?
[time=1794] Here are two statistics that are discouraging to me.
[time=1799] Over 50% of the churches in America have an average weekly attendance of less than 100.
[time=1822] Doesn't that boggle your mind when you read the scriptures?
[time=1825] And it says, we're to always be abounding in the work of the Lord.
[time=1829] Now, we're not here today to glorify the large church and certainly not this one.
[time=1835] But we are here today to talk about how can we abound in the Lord's work?
[time=1840] And if a church is 70 years old, they've been at it for three generations and there's still
[time=1846] not 100 people, something's missing.
[time=1851] What makes churches abound is that it's full of people who are abounding.
[time=1855] The first thing we've got to be as generous, and last week we said the second thing is we've got to be visionary.
[time=1863] Almost all of us would say, yes, we're a visionary.
[time=1866] We want to see people come to Christ, but let me ask you this.
[time=1869] Are you visionary?
[time=1871] Now let me help you measure that.
[time=1874] Unless these three things are true, you have no personal vision for Christ.
[time=1879] One, you have an active list of people that you're praying for by name who need Christ.
[time=1887] I don't mean God help the missionaries and all those heathen, amen.
[time=1891] I mean people you're praying for by name, Uncle Fred, everybody in the family knows Uncle
[time=1897] Fred needs something, it must be Christ.
[time=1900] Pray for him, your neighbor, that person you work with.
[time=1904] If you don't have a list of people that you're actively praying for, you've got no vision for Christ.
[time=1911] Number two, you are presently trained and equipped to share Christ if he gives you an
[time=1917] opportunity.
[time=1918] Now for some of you who've been trained and equipped, but you've already forgot it and that doesn't count.
[time=1924] But you're fresh and relevant, you're ready to share the gospel.
[time=1929] Peter said, "Be ready always to give answer to every person and answer for the reason
[time=1936] for the hope that's in you." If you're not prepared to share the gospel, you've got no vision for Christ.
[time=1944] And number three, when you take out your calendar and plan the week, you purposely plan some
[time=1950] time to give you a chance to pray around people who need Christ the most.
[time=1955] If those three things are not true, you don't have a vision for Christ.
[time=1960] You may have a vision for others having a vision, but you don't have your own vision for Christ.
[time=1965] And you will not be abounding in the Lord's work unless those three things are true.
[time=1970] Now if you feel good, great.
[time=1972] If you don't feel good, you can feel good by tomorrow morning at this time.
[time=1975] You just have to do those three things, start praying for people by name, get involved in a class where you can learn to share your faith, and three, start scheduling yourself around the people.
[time=1987] Not to hit them up with the gospel, but to love them to Christ.
[time=1990] Those two qualities start a church abounding in the work of the Lord.
[time=1994] Now we're ready for today's message.
[time=1996] Okay.
[time=1997] Chapter 16, verse 10.
[time=1999] Would you open your Bible there, 1 Corinthians chapter 16 and verse 10?
[time=2005] I'm going to reread two verses from last week because we didn't cover them, and then today we'll start with verse 12.
[time=2011] But here's verse 10.
[time=2013] Now if Timothy come, see that he may be with you without fear, for he worketh the work
[time=2019] of the Lord, as I do.
[time=2023] Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto
[time=2029] me, for I look for him with the brethren." Now verse 12, "As touching our brother Apollus, I greatly desired him to come unto you with
[time=2042] the brethren, but his will was not to come at this time.
[time=2050] But he will come when he shall have a convenient time."
[time=2056] Watch, stand fast into faith, quit you like men, be strong, but all your things be done
[time=2071] with love.
[time=2073] I beseech you brethren, you know the house of Staphonus that it was the first fruits and a cayah that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints, that you submit
[time=2085] yourselves unto such, and do everyone that help with us and labor earth.
[time=2091] I am glad of the coming of Staphonus, and fortuenatus and a cayus, for that which was
[time=2098] lacking on your part, they have supplied.
[time=2103] For they have refreshed my spirit and yours, therefore acknowledge them that are such.
[time=2114] The churches of Asia greet you, Aquil and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, with the church
[time=2122] that is in their house, all the brethren greet you.
[time=2127] Greet one another with an holy kiss, the salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand.
[time=2136] If any man loved not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, marinatha, the grace
[time=2146] of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with you.
[time=2150] My love be with you all in Jesus Christ.
[time=2154] The church that abounds, here are some more qualities, we are going to end up with a total of seven.
[time=2160] I am not sure how long it will take us to get all seven, but you have got two generous in visionary, now here is a third, cooperative.
[time=2168] In verses 10 through 12, and then in verse 16, the apostle Paul talks about a church cooperating
[time=2177] with one another.
[time=2180] He first mentions a young man by the name of Timothy.
[time=2183] Timothy was probably to them a stranger, but he is going to come visit Corinth on some official business.
[time=2190] The second individual was a Paulus who was really not much of a stranger to them.
[time=2194] They had encountered a Paulus before, but particularly there was Staphonus and those
[time=2200] who were like them who were intimate companions with them.
[time=2206] If you look at verse 10, Paul says, Timothy is going to come, and when he comes, I want
[time=2212] him to be with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord as I also do.
[time=2219] Not no man therefore despise him, but conduct him forth in peace.
[time=2225] When the apostle Paul talks about cooperation, I believe he is talking about one of the most needed characteristics of our lives.
[time=2233] Do you know that the worst plan that you could possibly come up with, I mean just a dumb lousy
[time=2239] idiotic plan will work every time, if everybody would just cooperate, and the best plan that
[time=2246] any of us could ever come up with will fail miserably without cooperation.
[time=2251] For a number of years, our young people have gone to Florida on beach evangelism.
[time=2255] I think this will be their tenth year when they go this spring, and we can train them in evangelism and we can teach them all kinds of techniques, and they can pray, and they can sing.
[time=2265] They can do the whole nine yards, but the thing will fail miserably if they don't have cooperation.
[time=2270] As a matter of fact, we even made up a little cheer where they spell out C, O, P, you know
[time=2276] cooperation, it's critical, and they've got to cooperate, because you see they get on a bus and it stops for dinner at McDonald's, they get back on the bus and it stops at McDonald's for breakfast, they get back on the bus and it stops at McDonald's for lunch, and it's like that for nine straight days.
[time=2294] I mean you have withdrawals from grease burgers at the end of the week, and you can hear the groaning in the back of the bus every time they pass, the golden arch is no, no, please don't stop there, in the bus goes.
[time=2307] But you know what?
[time=2308] They make it because they've got a spirit of cooperation.
[time=2311] That is so important to our lives, and if we're going to have an impact for Christ, we're going to have to have cooperation.
[time=2318] This past week, I was really privileged to go to a conference.
[time=2321] It wasn't the typical conference where somebody comes and speaks, and the rest of us sit and go, oh, ah, ah, great stuff, I'll steal that and share it next Sunday in my church.
[time=2331] This was a different type of conference.
[time=2333] Twelve of us were there by invitation from considerably large churches that were growing.
[time=2341] To talk about what can we do to strengthen each other's churches and to grow?
[time=2347] What problems do we have here at Blackhawk that maybe a friend in Texas said, we crossed that bridge last year.
[time=2354] It was a cooperative effort.
[time=2356] As a result of those type of meetings, a great deal of work and research has been done on what makes churches grow.
[time=2364] There are a number of qualities, but in reading this book, Church Growth, State of the Art,
[time=2370] it makes a simple statement.
[time=2372] The churches grow when there's cooperation between pastors and lay leaders, hired staff
[time=2380] members and volunteers.
[time=2383] When the people in the Pew are as committed as the people in the pulpit, and I just shut
[time=2389] the book and said, God, thank you, Blackhawk's such a place.
[time=2396] What a privilege it is to be here, and your God will continue to use this church in your life if there's that spirit of cooperation, but let's define that just a little bit, okay.
[time=2407] Now Paul said verse 11, let no man therefore despise him, but conduct him fourth in peace
[time=2413] that he may come unto me.
[time=2414] Three things mark Paul's expectation of cooperation between the Corinthians and Timothy.
[time=2421] First of all, they expected them to recognize Timothy.
[time=2426] He said, when he comes, don't let him be amongst you with fear, but you recognize him as a worker for Christ just as I am.
[time=2434] And Paul was saying, you'd receive me, receive Timothy because we're co-laborers in Christ and to recognize people.
[time=2441] You know one of the greatest things we can do for each other in this church or with other churches is to recognize the worth of the other person.
[time=2449] All they may do it differently than you would do it.
[time=2451] They may do it completely opposite of the way you'd prefer it, but you know if you're honest, you'll recognize that God is using them, that they've got gifts.
[time=2460] They're not all the same, but we'll recognize one another.
[time=2466] That'll lead to cooperation.
[time=2468] Somebody said, Lord, bless my fore and just us and no more.
[time=2473] God's got a big plan and it calls for cooperation that requires us to recognize one another.
[time=2481] Second thing, it calls us not only to recognize but to respect.
[time=2485] It says, see to him that no man despise him.
[time=2488] Now that word despise when King James had it used was not quite as harsh a word as it
[time=2494] is today.
[time=2495] The word despise means to hate.
[time=2497] A year ago Adam was two and a half.
[time=2500] Kathy was sick, it was a Sunday night and I said, Adam, come on, you go to church with me.
[time=2504] Little boy put his hands in his pockets, he looked up at me and he said, Dad, I hate going to church with you.
[time=2511] I didn't know whether that hurt me more as a parent or as a pastor.
[time=2514] That was tough to take, hate.
[time=2517] Now Paul's not saying, don't any of you hate Timothy.
[time=2522] By despise he simply meant disrespect him, ignore him, push him to the side and that
[time=2528] would be easy to do.
[time=2529] They had some reasons why they might choose to push Timothy aside.
[time=2532] First of all, he was an outsider, probably had never been to Corinth before and none
[time=2538] of us like outsiders coming in and telling us what to do.
[time=2542] And here comes Timothy, cross the Aegean Sea with a letter in his hand from the Apostle Paul and he's going to tell the Corinthians what to do.
[time=2549] That doesn't go down easy with me, I don't know about you.
[time=2554] Paul said, don't push him aside.
[time=2557] Not only was Timothy coming from the outside but he was coming with authority.
[time=2562] He was coming to tell them what to do.
[time=2565] Timothy was coming because Corinth had problems and he was coming as Paul's emissary to set
[time=2571] it straight.
[time=2572] I don't like outsiders and I don't particularly like outsiders who are coming to tell me what to do.
[time=2577] And finally, Timothy was young, now I have a warm spot in my heart for him.
[time=2583] Timothy, 10 years later was being coached by Paul saying, Timothy, don't let them put
[time=2589] you down because you're young, you hang in there.
[time=2592] Here's this young guy coming from the outside with authority and you can imagine how easy it would have been for the Corinthians to try to minimize that, Paul said, don't minimize
[time=2602] him, cooperate from him, grow from him, work with him.
[time=2609] Finally, he says, receive him.
[time=2613] Not only respect him but receive him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come.
[time=2619] He's coming to you, you take good care of him, you receive him and then you take such good care of him that you'll send him back to me in peace, not bruised and battered emotionally but in peace to receive him.
[time=2634] That's what a cooperative spirit is, someone who recognizes others, respects them and receives
[time=2643] them.
[time=2644] I don't know about you but I would love to share in whatever rewards God's got for Billy Graham.
[time=2650] I think Billy Graham's going to receive some particularly great awards for what he's done for Christ.
[time=2655] I imagine Chuck Swindall is going to receive some very special awards and I wouldn't mind being there to receive what he receives and you know what you can and so can I.
[time=2665] Because Jesus taught this principle, Matthew chapter 10 verses 40 and 41, Jesus and whosoever
[time=2671] receives you, Christ said, receives me, whosoever receives me receives him that sent me and whosoever
[time=2679] receives a prophet in a prophet's name, they'll receive a prophet's reward.
[time=2684] And whosoever receives a righteous man in a righteous man's name, they'll receive a righteous man's reward.
[time=2693] What that's saying is if we cooperate with others, we're going to be partners with them
[time=2699] in ministry and partners with them in reward.
[time=2702] Do you know that if you're praying today for some ministries, maybe you're praying for Ken and Alice Cole in the Philippines, maybe you're praying for Ruth Yolkam in Bangladesh
[time=2711] or Kathy Bristol in Liberia.
[time=2713] If you're praying for them, if you're cooperating with them, maybe even supporting them, you're going to receive the same reward they do.
[time=2722] A church that's successful will have a cooperative spirit.
[time=2728] In this book that I referred to a moment ago, it was written in California about growing dynamic churches across America.
[time=2737] One particular story is told about a church that was starting another church.
[time=2743] One man had been praying about it, but he had never said another thing to another person.
[time=2748] On Monday morning, he got up, drove around town, found a spot that he thought would be a good place for a church, and he's never once mentioned it to anybody else.
[time=2758] This man calls all of the deacons of his church and says, "Meet me at such and such
[time=2764] a place at five o'clock." All the leadership of that church meant at five o'clock, and for the very first time, this man said, "I think we ought to start a branch church in this city, and I think it ought to be right here and ought to start next Sunday." That's pretty abrupt planning, isn't it?
[time=2785] That man was a pastor, and he looked at one of the deacons, and he said to the deacon, he said, "What do you think of that idea?" Deacon looked around the church.
[time=2795] It was a nightclub.
[time=2796] Well, it wasn't a nightclub.
[time=2798] It was just a rented hall that usually had some pretty wild things happening at night.
[time=2804] The smell of liquor was still lingering in the air, and the man crossed his arms, and he said, "Well, pastor, the way I see it's this way.
[time=2811] We pay you to lead.
[time=2813] And we ought to follow your leadership until you prove you can't lead, and then we'll fire you." But until then, we'll follow you.
[time=2821] That book was written in California, but it wasn't written about California.
[time=2825] It was written about Fort Wayne.
[time=2828] And that little spot is right out here on Laymeyer Road called Bojab Clubhouse.
[time=2834] It was the start of one of twelve churches that a manual Baptist church started because
[time=2842] there is a spirit of cooperation.
[time=2845] By the way, we were the twelfth.
[time=2849] We were the twelfth.
[time=2852] Because you see, Tom Younger had a vision, and there was a body of people that said, "I'll go with it.
[time=2859] I'll cooperate." Now to be sure, no organization should be led by an autocrat, but every organization
[time=2867] ought to be spirited by cooperation.
[time=2871] That's what makes things happen.
[time=2874] The next quality of a church that is a growing and dynamic church, a bounding in the work of the Lord, is not only is it a cooperative church, but it's a supporting church.
[time=2885] Look down at verse 15, and we meet somebody who's relatively new in the pages of Scripture.
[time=2890] "I beseech you, brethren, to know the house of Staphonus." Now, by knowing, it means to do more than to just say, "Oh, yeah, I remember Staphonus, good old Steve." What a guy.
[time=2903] It means to take note of him and to learn from him.
[time=2908] What is it Paul wanted Corinth and Blackhawk to learn?
[time=2913] About the supportive spirit.
[time=2915] At the end of that verse, it says that, "His household that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints." Verse 17, "I am glad for the coming of these three men, Staphonus, Fortune, Anus, and
[time=2928] Cakias, for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied, for they have refreshed
[time=2935] my spirit and yours.
[time=2938] Therefore acknowledge them that are such." Now by somebody that's a supporter, what is somebody who is a supporter, a team player?
[time=2949] Three things come out of this passage to me.
[time=2952] First of all, it's somebody who is sensitive to needs.
[time=2955] It says in verse 15, "They devoted themselves to the ministry." Notice it says, "They devoted themselves." The structure of that language is saying that not that they were self-appointed to some great position, it just simply said, "They of themselves devoted themselves."
[time=2973] Nobody had to come and ask them and say, "Hey Fred, you know we're putting together this new missions project and we really need somebody who will make 500 phone calls and we prayed about it and you're the guy." Then somebody was button-hold.
[time=2988] It was somebody who saw the need and of themselves, they began to take care of it.
[time=2994] William Barkley makes this comment about the early church.
[time=2998] He states, "In the early church, willingness and spontaneous service was the beginning
[time=3007] of an official office.
[time=3010] A man became a leader in the church, not by some appointment, but as a matter of his
[time=3016] life and of his work."
[time=3022] Many of you, like me, enjoy listening to John MacArthur on the radio, one of the dynamic churches of America, Grace Community Church in Panorama City, California.
[time=3032] You know how you become a staff member at Grace?
[time=3036] What you do is you're a part of the church and when you build up a ministry that is so growing and so vital that it takes all of your time, then they hire you.
[time=3045] That's how they add staff members.
[time=3048] Somebody saw a need, started to meet it, made themselves available to God and they just
[time=3054] began to serve people and they were a supporter because they were sensitive to needs.
[time=3061] You know the church will grow, this church or any church will grow, not when leadership organizes programs but when people are sensitive to each other's needs.
[time=3074] Nobody can be sensitive to everybody's needs but if we're all making our job to be sensitive to those people around us, it'll click, it'll work, it'll grow and it will sponsor
[time=3085] spontaneous ministry.
[time=3089] One of the keys to the early church was it was decentralized.
[time=3093] Now Peter was not apathetic but when they came to him and said listen Peter, we don't like the way the food's being divvied up here.
[time=3101] It looks all the time like these widows are getting more than these widows.
[time=3105] You know what Peter said, fine, you take care of it.
[time=3108] Just choose out amongst you seven guys, fool the Holy Spirit, whiz them, let them take care of it and run with the ball, I'm going to go pray.
[time=3114] What would happen in most churches if the pastor said to get a problem, okay go take care of it, I'll pray, but that was their decentralized approach, keeping people close
[time=3125] to people sensitive to each other's needs.
[time=3130] Not only is a supporter somebody who's sensitive to needs, it's somebody who's steadfast in service.
[time=3137] If you have your King James Bible, there's an interesting word here, very familiar to us.
[time=3141] In verse 15 my translation says they devoted themselves to ministry.
[time=3147] The King James says they were addicted to ministry.
[time=3152] That's a word we often hear but not coming out of the pages of Scripture.
[time=3156] Somebody who has addicted to something is somebody who has first of all a habit that has been formed.
[time=3163] If you're addicted to narcotics, it's because you've formed a habit of using those narcotics.
[time=3168] If you're addicted to alcohol or nicotine, it's because you've made a habit of those.
[time=3173] If you're addicted to Coca-Cola like I am, it's because you've made a habit of that.
[time=3179] Second thing about an addiction is it's not only a habit, you will experience withdrawal
[time=3186] if you break the habit.
[time=3189] If you're used to smoking 10 cigarettes a day and you try to quit, your body's going to start talking to you about that.
[time=3198] There's not only a habit there, there's a withdrawal that you'll go through.
[time=3203] Finally, there'll be an inner urge compelling you to do it.
[time=3209] Wouldn't it be great if we were all addicted to serving?
[time=3213] I mean we've just got a habit of serving.
[time=3215] That's just the way we live our life.
[time=3216] We just serve over here and we serve over there.
[time=3219] We've got a habit of it and then one day we stop doing it and we've got a headache.
[time=3223] Oh man.
[time=3224] What do you think's wrong?
[time=3225] I don't think I've been serving enough today and I've got this headache.
[time=3228] Man, I think I'll just go serve somebody.
[time=3230] Oh, I feel better.
[time=3231] It's great.
[time=3232] The urge is satisfied.
[time=3235] That's a way Stefanus in his household work.
[time=3239] They were people who not only say, "Yeah, I saw and needed and I did that." Now it's somebody else's turn.
[time=3245] You know, one of the tendencies for many of us who've been here a long time at Black
[time=3251] Caucus is when something comes up is to say, "Well, I've done that before." And then with a false party, I'll let somebody else have the chance.
[time=3260] Oh, how generous of you.
[time=3265] These people were supportive because they not only saw the knee, they were steadfast.
[time=3270] They were addicted to it.
[time=3271] They just kept doing it and they kept doing it and they kept doing it.
[time=3276] Third quality of a supporting person is that they are spiritually refreshing.
[time=3283] Spiritually refreshing.
[time=3285] Verse 17, "I'm glad for the coming of these three men." They supplied what was lacking on your part for they have refreshed my spirit.
[time=3293] 10 years.
[time=3294] Do you ever notice there are some people when you get around them, the tempo of the conversation
[time=3301] picks up, the level of joy is just, it's right there.
[time=3306] And after you're with them for 10 minutes, you've got twice the energy as you did before.
[time=3312] Then there are other people.
[time=3315] I mean, they could make a brand new razor blade dull with one pass over their face.
[time=3322] I mean, they have got the spiritual gift of discouragement and it is epidemic in its contagious nature.
[time=3329] Solomon says, "Iron sharpens, iron soul a man's countenance is shortened by his friends." And there are people in this church that every time I rub up against them, it feels good.
[time=3340] They're sharpening.
[time=3341] And I've got to admit to you, there are some people in this congregation that they're
[time=3347] so lethargic that a funeral seems like an upbeat program next to them.
[time=3357] They are not a well of refreshment.
[time=3361] They're like a dry, salty cracker.
[time=3366] Let me ask you something.
[time=3367] Which kind of person are you?
[time=3369] When people get around you, are they refreshed?
[time=3373] Are they encouraged?
[time=3374] Are they picked up?
[time=3375] Or after they're around you, they say, "Boy, I didn't know it was that bad." Now, how did these men refresh Paul?
[time=3383] Well, it says in verse 17, "They simply did it by supplied what was lacking."
[time=3389] It's subjective to say what was lacking.
[time=3392] Some would say it was money and they brought money.
[time=3394] That could be, but I don't think so, because Paul is usually pretty blunt about money.
[time=3398] When he talks about money, he says money.
[time=3400] You know what I really think it is?
[time=3403] I think it was simple concern.
[time=3405] I think Paul had gone from Athens, to Corinth, and Corinth, to Asia.
[time=3409] He had been around the whole Mediterranean world, and the basic attitude of the Corinthians was, "So what?" They didn't follow up, they didn't keep in contact, they didn't care.
[time=3421] And what these three guys did is they cared.
[time=3424] Now, we're going to take a group to Manila, and I hope many of you are with us in 19 88.
[time=3429] And we're going to work on planting four churches.
[time=3432] We're going to work establishing a medical clinic, but you know one of the things we're going to do that the Filipino Christians are looking forward to more than anything else?
[time=3439] We're going to have a hot dog roast together.
[time=3442] Isn't that a deep spiritual ministry?
[time=3445] If you've never thought you qualified for missions before, if you can boil water, you qualify, you can cook hot dogs, say, "Well, why on earth are you going halfway around
[time=3456] the world to make hot dogs?" Well, we're going to do more than that, but those people will be so encouraged just to
[time=3463] see you, and that you would come to their country, that you were concerned about them, that you loved their people like they loved their people, and that concern refreshes their heart, and they just want to sit down and tell you they love you for coming and have a hot dog together.
[time=3480] To them that is a tube steak, to us it's little, to them it's more than just food, it's refreshment.
[time=3490] May God make of each of us, and of this church, people who are spiritually refreshing.
[time=3498] There's no shortcuts.
[time=3499] We've got to be sensitive to needs and steadfast in service, and then we'll be spiritually refreshing.
[time=3511] It's a very cold day in Fort Wayne, but I hope that you received a warm response as you
[time=3517] listen to the special music from Rejoice and Marsha Ives, and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3524] If as a result of today's program you made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God and accepting Him as personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3534] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3537] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus.
[time=3540] Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3544] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3547] I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of the sins that I've committed, and give me eternal life.
[time=3553] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3557] We are always pleased with decisions that are made, and if you've made a decision today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3564] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision to Help You Get Started in Your Spiritual Walk With God." To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Tideless Insights," please write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
