[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=113] The Christian life is also a life of joy and conflict.
[time=118] We're called to be good soldiers and to fight the good fight, but many of us aren't certain where the battle is and with whom we should fight.
[time=126] When World War I broke out, a dispatch was sent from the war ministry in London
[time=132] to all of the British outpost.
[time=134] It came to one remote outpost in North Africa.
[time=138] The message read, "War declared.
[time=142] Arrest all foreign aliens in your district." Two days later, a message came back from that North African outpost.
[time=150] It read, "We have arrested ten Germans, six Italians, four Belgians, one American,
[time=157] and two Australians.
[time=160] Please advise us as quickly as possible with whom are we at war?"
[time=165] [MUSIC]
[time=176] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=179] We're glad you've chosen to spend part of your day with us.
[time=183] Today, Rick is continuing his series, "Abounding in the Work of the Lord" with a message entitled "Spiritual Warfare." His text is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=194] The scriptures repeatedly remind us that we are to be good soldiers, that we are engaged in a war.
[time=201] Many Christians, however, are not only unprepared for the battle, they have no idea who the enemy is.
[time=208] In this last lesson of 1 Corinthians, we will receive the final marching instructions from Paul to the church at Corinth.
[time=215] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=220] We will be looking at verses 13 through 24.
[time=224] We'll be hearing special music from our sanctuary choir, Brian Lowson, and the Black Hawk Singers.
[time=236] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=245] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=249] Now here's Rick.
[time=252] Second morning worship service, and to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=258] We look forward every Sunday morning to coming to this place and praising God together, because He has transformed our life.
[time=266] He's called us out of darkness into the gospel of His marvelous light, and there's coming a day when there will be no more night.
[time=275] Our choir is going to sing a great majestic song of praise with that title, "No More Night." And right after they sing, we're going to sing together when we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be.
[time=288] So right now take out your hymn books and turn to hymn number 673, and after the choir sings, we're going to transition right into that anthem of praise when we all get to heaven by singing the first and fourth verses together.
[time=302] We're glad you're here. Thankful for our choir's preparation and leadership and worship and your participation.
[time=332] [MUSIC - 322 seconds]
[time=673] Would you just put your hymnals away and just raise your voices now one more time on that chorus and we all get to heaven smile and anticipate that day, sing it together when we all get to heaven
[time=688] [MUSIC]
[time=710] Amen. What a glorious privilege to sing together with the choir and the congregation, the instrumentalists.
[time=718] We appreciate everyone that's here today and those of you that did participate, we thank you for it.
[time=723] I trust that you've got a blessing from your neighbor as you sang when we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be.
[time=731] Just a few weeks ago in our summer, our evening Bible study, excuse me, we had the opportunity to listen to Rick as he talks about
[time=739] this we believe in our church spoke of the literal creation of the seven days of God creating our world.
[time=747] He can just speak a word and things can happen because of his great power and yet we are to be here today to praise his holy name.
[time=755] I trust that you can get in the attitude of praise as Brian sings for us.
[time=759] The song is not asking for anything, it's just simply saying may I praise you for who you are and may we indeed do that as he sings.
[time=767] Brian Lawson.
[time=769] [MUSIC]
[time=774] You spoke the words and all the words came into order.
[time=781] You waved your hand and planets filled, the empty skies.
[time=789] You placed the woman and the man inside the garden, and though they fell they found compassion in your eyes.
[time=804] Oh Lord I stand in awe of the wonder of your deeds, yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees.
[time=818] Lord I praise you because of who you are, not because of all the mighty things you've done.
[time=832] Lord I worship you because of who you are, to all the reason that I need to voice my praise because of who you are.
[time=854] One holy night you brought your promise from a virgin, and promise grew as he revealed to us your heart.
[time=869] Enduring love displayed throughout his crucifixion, and in the dark you tore the grave and death apart.
[time=883] Oh Lord I stand in awe of the wonder of your deeds, yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees.
[time=897] Lord I praise you because of who you are, not because of all the mighty things you've done.
[time=911] Lord I worship you because of who you are, you're all the reason that I need to voice my praise.
[time=926] Lord I praise you because of who you are, not because of all the mighty things you've done.
[time=940] Lord I worship you because of who you are, for all the reason that I need to voice my praise because of who you are,
[time=961] because of who you are, because of who you are.
[time=991] Lord I thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=995] We were just here reflecting on how well the Old Testament walked through the Bible Seminar went.
[time=1000] Rick last night we had a high school ball game and many of the people that attended the Seminar were there, and just everyone that I talked to come in and how valuable it was to put the Old Testament in chronological order and in perspective,
[time=1011] and I think it was well worthwhile.
[time=1013] You know that was a little hard for me to take because my wife came home and said that was the best thing I've ever seen on the Bible.
[time=1019] I have that occasionally when my wife hears things on the radio and says that's the best music group I've ever heard.
[time=1024] Well it keeps us in our place doesn't it, but we did have a delightful time but also a building time in our life spiritually,
[time=1031] and we're already talking about when we'll offer the walk through the New Testament Seminar, and when that comes we'll make sure that we let you know.
[time=1039] I'm sure many of you are watching came when you grew in your understanding and appreciation of God's Word.
[time=1045] Pete we're having a special music guest on the Thursday night coming up this month.
[time=1050] Yes Rick, Greg Buchanan was recently at the Christian Booksellers convention where I saw him and got a call the other day
[time=1057] that he's coming from Los Angeles through to New York and asked if we had an opportunity to have him,
[time=1063] and I'd like to encourage all of you to mark on your calendar Thursday February 26th at 7 p.m.
[time=1069] We'll have him here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church Convocation Center. Rick, he's an outstanding harpist,
[time=1075] and I like to think that we need a little knowledge about the harp and he won't just strumma, but he just does everything with that harp and plays a variety of music that you've never heard on the harp before,
[time=1086] and he's just an exciting, exciting musician.
[time=1089] Well being on the Thursday night will give many of our friends a special opportunity to come who are committed elsewhere on Sundays.
[time=1097] Many of you right in are when we meet you personally, you tell us how active you are in your own church, and then this is just a supplement to your Christian life.
[time=1105] Well having a concert on a Thursday night allows you to come without the interruption of your church services,
[time=1111] and we're glad that we can have this special event. The date and the time again please.
[time=1116] Yes the concert is on Thursday evening February 26th at 7 p.m. here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church Convocation Center.
[time=1124] Today when we come to the part of our broadcast where we're studying the scriptures, we'll be having our final message from 1 Corinthians and the 16th chapter.
[time=1134] There Paul turns from his gospel preaching about the love of the Lord Jesus Christ to teaching the church how to get ready to fight,
[time=1144] and how many of us fail to remember that we are in a real fight.
[time=1148] Most of us don't know who our enemy is, most of us don't know how to go about fighting the enemy, and we want to teach that today. And to go along with today's message, we have this booklet called "Contemporary Counterfeits" by John Jay Davis.
[time=1162] Dr. Davis is a friend, a former professor of mine who is an expert in studying the scriptures,
[time=1169] and looking at some of the key issues about counterfeits today, the occult, Satanism, false prophets today.
[time=1177] Every year we meet people who say, "I predict." Well, are those people prophets of God or are they not?
[time=1184] This booklet will go a long way into teaching you what God's word the Bible has to say about some of these modern counterfeits,
[time=1192] how you can know who they are, how you can discern between truth and air.
[time=1196] It's a thoroughly biblical study, and we'll send you a copy if you'll write to us today.
[time=1201] It'll be a free copy from us to you simply write to us.
[time=1205] This week we are offering the book "Contemporary Counterfeits" by John Jay Davis.
[time=1210] You'd like to receive a copy simply right to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1220] Once again, that's the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1228] We do hope that you'll write today, along with requesting this booklet, your words of encouragement,
[time=1235] our suggestions about the ministry are always well taken.
[time=1238] We love to hear from you.
[time=1240] Your letters, your comments are part of what shapes our philosophy of ministry, because we want to be sensitive to the needs that you have spiritually.
[time=1248] So we do encourage you to write, and we would enjoy hearing from you this week.
[time=1253] Once again, our address is the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1260] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1263] Thank you for joining us today, and as we go back to our morning worship service, we'll be looking forward to hearing from the ministry of our music department once again, and then studying about spiritual warfare.
[time=1283] [MUSIC]
[time=1290] Father, the more you've given me your love, and pulled me on,
[time=1305] the more my praise is not enough, is not enough.
[time=1315] You said, he who would go first, go last, and so I pray that you'll be first in all I ask.
[time=1339] The highest praise is more than spoken words is what my heart would say.
[time=1349] All I have to offer you in my small way is to live for you, for you.
[time=1364] The highest praise, not to see and yet believe you died for me.
[time=1374] Sometimes in the night I thank you silently, for all you do.
[time=1390] The highest praise I can give today is to give my life to you.
[time=1416] [MUSIC]
[time=1423] Father, if you ask for something great,
[time=1434] I would have tried, and yet you only wanted me.
[time=1447] The highest praise is more than spoken words is what my heart would say.
[time=1457] All I have to offer you in my small way is to live for you, for you.
[time=1472] The highest praise, not to see and yet believe you died for me.
[time=1483] Sometimes in the night I thank you silently, for all you do.
[time=1498] The highest praise I can give today is to give my life to you.
[time=1524] [MUSIC]
[time=1538] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1545] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1547] We've come today to give him our highest praise.
[time=1551] Let's pray together and do that.
[time=1554] God, we give you our highest praise.
[time=1557] We praise you above everything we know, above life itself.
[time=1562] Father, we praise you because you are God.
[time=1566] You have made us and you've made us for yourself, and we praise you.
[time=1572] And we praise you above our greatest joy and satisfactions.
[time=1576] We praise you above our greatest accomplishment.
[time=1580] We praise you above our greatest possession.
[time=1584] We praise you above our greatest achievement.
[time=1588] God, we've come today to worship and to praise you.
[time=1592] And to declare today, at this first day of the week, our allegiance to you.
[time=1600] We pledge to you our love and our life to serve you this week.
[time=1606] We ask you to refresh us in our spiritual commitments and awaken us and arouse our spiritual sight.
[time=1614] We might see life from your perspective and not our own.
[time=1619] God, we would pray today that we would be reminded of the great spiritual battle that is round about us
[time=1626] and in which we do fight.
[time=1628] Father, we pray for the warfare that the spirit might win.
[time=1635] We pray that in the war for those who need Christ today there might be those who would be born again into the family of God.
[time=1645] We pray for those who are flirting with temptation and sin who see it so attractive but fail to see that's danger and that they would make shipwreck their lives.
[time=1659] God, we pray that you would turn the hearts of fathers towards their children.
[time=1664] The hearts of mothers towards their homes and the hearts of children towards their parents.
[time=1671] We pray that you would heal our homes.
[time=1673] Make them a citadel for our peace and for the prosperity of the gospel.
[time=1679] We pray today for those who have suffered great loss.
[time=1683] We pray for Kathy Russell and the loss of her loved one.
[time=1688] Beth Ward and the loss of her stepfather pray for Debbie Patterson and the death of her father.
[time=1697] God, we ask you to comfort them.
[time=1700] Father, we pray for those who are ill and particularly for Dean Lockwood that you administer to them both physically and spiritually.
[time=1709] Father, we would pray today for those who are going through the terrible, terrible
[time=1715] herd of rejection that you would give peace and strength.
[time=1721] Pray for single parents today.
[time=1725] Life's toughest job being tackled alone.
[time=1730] God, through your word, we would now want to see you to know you not just to know about you, God, but we hunger to know you.
[time=1739] So we ask you to speak to our hearts today.
[time=1743] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1746] [AMEN] At the outbreak of World War I, the London Ministry of War sent a dispatch to all of their military posts.
[time=1758] The dispatch read, "War has been declared, arrest all of the enemy aliens in your district."
[time=1769] Well, that dispatch went from London all the way around the world and one particular outpost in North Africa, very remote outpost, received the memo.
[time=1779] And so they immediately put it into action and wrote back this message.
[time=1785] We received your instruction.
[time=1788] We have arrested 10 Germans, six Italians, four Belgians, two Frenchmen,
[time=1796] two Australians, and one American.
[time=1800] Please kindly advise us with whom we're at war.
[time=1806] Our spiritual lives are often like that.
[time=1810] There's a war going on, but we're not quite sure who is the enemy.
[time=1816] There was a quote by an executive of one company who described his firm in this way.
[time=1821] He said, "Our corporate policy is like this. Ready? Fire? Aim."
[time=1828] A lot of us live our life like that, don't we?
[time=1831] We're out there going. We're doing something. We're fighting.
[time=1834] But who is the enemy and who are we supposed to be aiming at?
[time=1838] Turn in your Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 16, and today I just want to read a few verses for you.
[time=1846] Chapter 16 and verse 13 for now, actually 13 and 14.
[time=1852] We'll look at some more verses, but for right now, let me just read these two.
[time=1857] He says, "Be on your guard. Stand firm in the faith.
[time=1863] Be men of courage. Be strong. Do everything in love."
[time=1871] Those commands are very military in nature.
[time=1874] As a matter of fact, there are five commands.
[time=1877] Four of them arise out of the ranks of soldiers.
[time=1882] The Bible makes it abundantly clear that we are in a war, a spiritual war, and that we daily exist in battle.
[time=1892] That's an imagery and a reality that many times our churches lose,
[time=1899] and we as individuals fail to remain conscious.
[time=1903] There's a war going on.
[time=1906] Maybe it's the pacifism movements of the late '60s and early '70s.
[time=1911] Maybe it's our disillusionment with military buildup around the world.
[time=1916] Maybe it's our fear of molecular holocaust.
[time=1920] But somehow we've retreated from the reality of talking about the fact that we are in a spiritual battle
[time=1928] and that we are called consistently in the scriptures, soldiers, and that we are to be fighting the good fight.
[time=1938] Keep your church bulletin here in 1 Corinthians chapter 16, and turn with me, if you will, to Ephesians.
[time=1944] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, that neighborhood.
[time=1949] Just a few books past where we are, chapter 6 and verse 10.
[time=1956] Paul wrote these words to the church at Ephesus.
[time=1959] "Finally be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
[time=1966] Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand against the devil's schemes
[time=1974] for our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[time=1980] but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[time=1986] against the powers of this dark world, and against forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[time=1997] Therefore put on the full armor of God so that when the evil day comes,
[time=2005] you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything to stand,
[time=2011] stand firm." You see that imagery?
[time=2017] But that's just not imagery.
[time=2019] These are not selected words of life chosen to be an analogy to the Christian life.
[time=2026] This is actuality.
[time=2029] We are in a spiritual battle today, and the enemy is Satan.
[time=2039] But he is only one enemy that you and I must fight.
[time=2043] There is a second enemy.
[time=2045] Turn with me now if you will to 1 Timothy.
[time=2047] Just a few more letters back.
[time=2049] 1 Timothy, chapter 6.
[time=2058] Verse 10 says, "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
[time=2065] Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and have pierced themselves with many griefs.
[time=2073] But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness,
[time=2079] godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.
[time=2084] Fight the good fight.
[time=2087] Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good conscience confession in the presence of many witnesses."
[time=2098] Again, the reality of a fight.
[time=2100] This time, Timothy is the one charged to fight, to pursue righteousness and battle and wage war fighting a good fight.
[time=2111] This time it's against not Satan, but actually self.
[time=2117] Our inner desire to please ourself, to please ourself with more things, to please ourself with more money, to please our appetite sexually, dietarily, simply to live for ourself.
[time=2129] There is a constant battle to deny ourself and to live for Christ.
[time=2135] It is a spiritual battle.
[time=2139] There's a third enemy.
[time=2141] Turn with me if you will to 2 Corinthians.
[time=2143] Just turn back to where your bulletin is and then go one book past that.
[time=2148] In Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 4, actually verse 3,
[time=2158] "For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.
[time=2166] The weapons we fight with are not weapons of the world.
[time=2170] On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
[time=2176] They have to demolish arguments.
[time=2178] And every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captivity, take captive every thought to make it to be obedient to Christ." This enemy, not Satan, not self, but secular thinking.
[time=2199] In a biblical phrase out of the King James Bible, the world, and I are in a battle against three enemies, Satan, our old nature,
[time=2209] and this world in which we live in.
[time=2212] We're in a war against Satan because he is constantly trying to keep us and everyone from coming to the knowledge of Christ and those who have the knowledge of Christ from being effective in service.
[time=2223] We're in a battle against ourself because each of us have two natures.
[time=2228] There's an old nature that was born simply and lives within us and a new nature that came when we received Christ, and the two are contrary, and there's an inner war going on.
[time=2239] It's like the man who said, "Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm schizophrenic, and so am I." Inside us, there are two different dimensions, two different natures, and one of them says, "Please yourself, you deserve it. Go for it."
[time=2257] The other one says, "I belong to Christ and I need to live for him." And there is a war.
[time=2264] The third battle is with secular society, not that it's us and them.
[time=2269] We love the people, but we hate the thinking that constantly says, "Live for this world, follow this philosophy, drink from this well,
[time=2281] and box is out God and calls us in the words of Paul to be conformed to its image."
[time=2290] There is a spiritual battle and a spiritual warfare.
[time=2294] But somehow we've lost that.
[time=2296] That isn't being a part of our thinking as Christians.
[time=2299] Take out your hymnbook just for an illustration today.
[time=2302] Turn with me, if you will, to hymn number 619.
[time=2306] I think you, like me, will be impressed with how some of the saints of yours
[time=2313] going by have so clearly perceived the spiritual war that we're in.
[time=2318] All we're going to do is look at some titles.
[time=2322] We're certainly not going to sing at this moment.
[time=2326] 619, the title Stand Up for Jesus, 620, onward Christian soldiers marching as to war,
[time=2339] 621, who is on the Lord's side?
[time=2342] Who will serve the king?
[time=2345] 622.
[time=2347] We're marching to Zion, 623, the banner of the cross.
[time=2355] Then the editors of our hymnbook gave us a break from the combat in 624 and 625.
[time=2360] We're just going to sit down, take a rest, count our blessings.
[time=2363] 626, marching beneath the banner.
[time=2368] 627, "My soul be on thy guard."
[time=2374] 628, "The fight is on." 629, "I'm trusting the Lord Jesus." 630, "Sound the battle cry." 631, "Soldiers of Christ arise."
[time=2393] 632, "To the work." 633, "Hold the fort." 634, "Fight the good fight."
[time=2408] 633, "It's something about the perception of the Christian life over the centuries." 634, "It's a war.
[time=2416] It's a battle." I'm all for it, but we've been flooded with the how to be happy books to the point where we think the spiritual war that we're called to is to a happy and fulfilled life.
[time=2429] And we're actually called to do battle against our old nature, against secular thinking that exalts itself up above the name of Christ and against Satan himself.
[time=2440] I like these words of Charles Wesley.
[time=2443] "Soldiers of Christ arise.
[time=2446] Put your armor on.
[time=2448] Strong in the strength which God supplies through his eternal Son.
[time=2453] Strong in the Lord of Host and in his mighty power.
[time=2457] Who in the strength of Jesus trust is more than conqueror."
[time=2463] Church had grown rather liberal.
[time=2465] They had lost their mission.
[time=2467] They had lost Christ as the center of its life.
[time=2470] But on a Sunday morning of tradition, they had a little boys choir that was scheduled to sing.
[time=2475] As little boys were lined up out back, one of little boys noticed a cross that was a part of the Easter pageant was tucked behind the door.
[time=2484] On Sunday morning, they were singing onward Christian soldiers and he really wasn't prepared and didn't have his words memorized.
[time=2490] All the rest of them came out and sang the right words, but he sang.
[time=2493] Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus hid behind the door.
[time=2501] Unfortunately, that was too true of the church.
[time=2505] We're hiding.
[time=2507] We're afraid.
[time=2510] We've retreated from the battle.
[time=2514] Chapter 16, verses 13 and 14, give us some military commands.
[time=2522] One quality of a church that's abounding in the work of the Lord.
[time=2526] A quality of an individual who is steadfast, unmovable.
[time=2532] Sounds like a counterdiction in terms, but please allow it.
[time=2536] Lovingly militant.
[time=2539] Here are the five commands.
[time=2541] The first one says, be on your guard.
[time=2544] It means be alert.
[time=2546] Many of you are my age.
[time=2548] Some of you are older and you'll remember Rin Tin Tin.
[time=2551] Do you remember Rin Tin Tin, Fort Apache?
[time=2554] And you picture that wood stockade and on every corner was a little tower.
[time=2559] On top of the tower would be a century.
[time=2562] Somebody who would be guarding.
[time=2565] A sentinel.
[time=2566] And this individual's job was while everyone else was sleeping, he was to be alert.
[time=2572] To be on guard watching for the enemy's activities.
[time=2580] The Corinthian church had failed miserably to be alert.
[time=2585] To be standing guard.
[time=2587] Division had crept into their church.
[time=2589] There's chapters one, two and three.
[time=2591] This person didn't like this person.
[time=2595] That person didn't like anybody.
[time=2598] And their meeting together was often simply more than a verbal denunciation of one another.
[time=2608] They hadn't kept their guard.
[time=2610] Immorality had become a part of their church.
[time=2613] Not only were there those in the church that were immoral, but there were those in the church that bragged about their immorality.
[time=2618] Some had failed to keep guard on their lives.
[time=2623] They had turned the Lord's Supper into a pagan bash.
[time=2630] If you'll pardon the bluntness at times, a drunken orgy.
[time=2636] They hadn't kept their guard.
[time=2639] There were those that were so caught up in charismatic confusion that they uttered out things not knowing what they were saying.
[time=2646] They were saying and they said Jesus be cursed.
[time=2651] Chapter 12 verses 1 through 3.
[time=2656] There were people there who had been so caught up in secular thinking that they denied the resurrection of Christ.
[time=2665] They hadn't kept their guard.
[time=2669] You've got to keep up your guard.
[time=2672] You've got to be alert because the opportunities for sin are like mosquitoes.
[time=2678] They are always after us, trying to suck the lifeblood out of us.
[time=2687] We've got to keep our guard up.
[time=2690] A second military command here says be standing firm in the faith.
[time=2700] Another military term.
[time=2702] Remember in these days they did not have ground-to-air missiles.
[time=2707] They didn't have computer-operated artillery.
[time=2710] They didn't have nuclear-powered submarines.
[time=2712] They weren't trying to kill the enemy from a range of 100 miles away.
[time=2717] They fought in what we call hand-to-hand combat.
[time=2721] I mean eye-to-eye, nose-to-nose, hand-to-hand, knee-to-knee.
[time=2728] And if you're going to be in hand-to-hand combat, one of the most important things is your footing.
[time=2735] You see, when that other soldier comes at you with his sword and he throws a blow, even if you can get your shield up to defect that sword, if your feet aren't strong and well planted,
[time=2749] the blow, though not piercing, would knock you to the ground and leave you totally vulnerable.
[time=2754] How you stand is so important in hand-to-hand combat.
[time=2759] We know more about athletics than we do about military.
[time=2763] So, at Sunday afternoon, the Washington Redskins are playing.
[time=2768] John Madden's the announcer.
[time=2770] It's a muddy field.
[time=2772] The Redskins are on the one-yard line and they're trying to push the ball across the goal line.
[time=2777] And Madden said, "Look at those hogs dig in.
[time=2780] They're rooting. They need grass for their feet." That's true.
[time=2786] If you're going to be a football player, the strength of the blocker is not in his arms.
[time=2791] It's in his legs.
[time=2794] It's how well the feet are planted.
[time=2798] How well are your feet planted in the faith?
[time=2803] The faith here I don't think, and I don't think, I'm sure it doesn't mean just to accept in Christ.
[time=2807] Don't go, "I've accepted Christ." Being rooted in the faith refers to the body of what we believe, the faith, this stuff.
[time=2817] How well are your feet planted in the scriptures?
[time=2822] Your strength spiritually will be directly proportional to your position in the Word.
[time=2828] You don't know the Word? You're not going to be strong spiritually.
[time=2831] You're not feeding yourself of God's scriptures.
[time=2834] You're not going to be strong spiritually.
[time=2839] There's a war out there, and if you're going to fight, and you are, you can only choose to win or lose.
[time=2849] If you want to win, you better root your mind, your heart, your emotions in the Word of God.
[time=2856] Stand firm in the faith.
[time=2859] The third command says, "King James, quit ye like men." Let me give you the new international version. It's very accurate.
[time=2867] It says, "Be men of courage." Let me give you my definition of courage.
[time=2876] Courage is the ability to make the hard choice, and then to live by its consequence.
[time=2893] The Corinthians had acted childish all along, back in chapter 3, verses 1, 2, and 3.
[time=2899] Paul amends that he cannot address them as many.
[time=2902] He says, "Brothers, I would not address you as spiritual, but as worldly, mere infants in Christ.
[time=2910] I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you're still not ready."
[time=2918] They were immature. They weren't men. They weren't ready to make the hard choices, and to dig in.
[time=2927] To be fearful is to be childish. My children are very much afraid of animals, so we got them a pet.
[time=2934] Little goldfish. They're doing fine. They really adjusted to wildlife in our home.
[time=2940] My sister has a Siberian Husky. When she stands up, puts her front paws on my shoulders, the dog's taller.
[time=2947] My kids don't do so well around her. They're afraid, but they're children.
[time=2954] You're not children. You're adults. You're to be a man of God, a woman of God, and that's marked my courage.
[time=2966] Courage is making the tough choices. Many, many of you are businessmen.
[time=2973] A week or so ago, I got stranded in an airport in another town.
[time=2977] I saw three people from our church stuck in the same airport.
[time=2981] Lots of us travel. Some of you travel with the same people week after week for your company.
[time=2988] They believe in working hard all day and partying hard all night.
[time=2993] You've got to make a hard choice. That's courage.
[time=3000] Some of you are high school and college students.
[time=3005] Your friends have begun to experiment with what they call the fast lane.
[time=3011] They say to you, "Come on. What's the matter? Are you afraid?"
[time=3018] They'll say, "If you love me, you'll let me." They'll say, "Go ahead. Everybody else is doing it." I mean, "Hey, it's not hip to be square. I don't care what Huey Lewis says. Do it."
[time=3033] The courage is that ability to make the right choice and then to live by the consequences of it.
[time=3041] It's hard. It's a battle and we're finding spiritual warfare.
[time=3051] God said to Ezekiel in Ezekiel 22.30, "I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall
[time=3059] and who would stand in the gap." God is always looking for a man, for a woman who is courageous.
[time=3070] Who can look into the eye of society and say, "Yes, when all of society says no."
[time=3077] But God said, "Yes." And a person who when all of society says, "Yes." They say, "No." When God says, "Say no."
[time=3091] Courage.
[time=3093] The fourth command is, "Be strong." Technically, this is a passive verb which means you don't do it yourself.
[time=3099] You have it done to you. In other words, be strengthened.
[time=3103] You can't make yourself totally strong.
[time=3109] Ultimately, that strength has to be imparted to you by God.
[time=3114] There are two things you must do to be strengthened.
[time=3117] The first is you must submit to God.
[time=3120] James chapter 4 verses 7 and 8 say these words, "Draw near unto God, he'll draw near to you.
[time=3127] Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=3130] You must submit yourself to God." He said, "Humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he will exalt you.
[time=3138] Submit yourself under the Lord." You must advocate the throne of your life.
[time=3143] Depose self and exalt Christ and submit to him.
[time=3148] And the second thing you must do, along with submitting to God, is you must self-discipline.
[time=3155] 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verses 24 through 27, Paul says this, "Any man who is striving for the masteries," that means the athletic championship,
[time=3166] must discipline himself. Paul said, "I beat my body." He wasn't talking about sadomasochism. He was saying, "I discipline myself.
[time=3175] Put it through all kinds of painful ordeals so that I can win."
[time=3185] If you want God to strengthen you, you must submit to him and be ready to discipline yourself.
[time=3192] Those are military terms, aren't they? That's what a soldier would hear from his commander.
[time=3198] That's what a new recruit are enlistee would hear from his training sergeant.
[time=3206] Be alert.
[time=3210] Be strong.
[time=3212] Stand firm.
[time=3215] Be courageous.
[time=3218] Let us never forget that we're in a battle, and our strength comes from the Lord and not ourselves.
[time=3226] Martin Luther put it so well in the second verse of Almighty Fortress is our God.
[time=3231] If we in our own strength can find, our striving would be losing.
[time=3237] If not the right man, we're on our side, a man of God's own choosing.
[time=3242] Does ask who that may be? Christ Jesus. It is he.
[time=3247] Lord, Sabbath off his name from age to age the same, and he shall win the battle.
[time=3257] Four military commands, and yet this fifth one, verse 14.
[time=3265] Do everything in love.
[time=3269] Obviously not a military command, but every bit as important as the first four, and in many ways it serves as a balance.
[time=3277] One time a Chinese girl was asked what's the difference between evangelism and her country, China and our country, the state.
[time=3284] And she said you Christians over here witness out of aggression.
[time=3290] We share Christ out of love.
[time=3293] There's a war, we're soldiers, and we must fight the big three.
[time=3299] But we must always approach people with the balance of love.
[time=3303] Perhaps Paul put it here because we must always remember that people are not the enemy.
[time=3310] That individual who anger controls him, he's not the enemy.
[time=3314] He's the victim of the enemy.
[time=3316] That individual is so abusive is not the enemy.
[time=3319] She is the victim of the enemy.
[time=3322] That individual who denounces Christ and lives a life of excess is not the enemy, but the victim of the enemy.
[time=3332] Do everything in love.
[time=3334] And so at the end of the chapter there are these final words, greet one another with a holy kiss, a Priscilla and Aquila.
[time=3342] They greet you in the church that's in their home.
[time=3347] There has to be a love and openness.
[time=3350] These people were appropriately affectionate.
[time=3354] They greeted each other with a holy kiss.
[time=3356] And to be honest in church history that got out of hand, there were those that abused it and looked at as an opportunity to fulfill the flesh.
[time=3363] But many times it was men greeting men, women greeting women, and each greeting others of their opposite sex.
[time=3370] Sometimes they just kissed the hand to be so discreet, but it was a sign of their love and their devotion.
[time=3378] One to another.
[time=3380] And it was appropriate.
[time=3382] It says a holy kiss.
[time=3385] It wasn't meant to be an expression of intimacy beyond the fact that they were brothers and sisters in Christ, and they were comrades in the same battle.
[time=3395] They were not only affectionate, they were open people.
[time=3399] Priscilla and Aquila, you'll find them in Rome.
[time=3403] You'll find them in Corinth, and now you'll find them in Asia.
[time=3406] They got moved all around because they were open people, and God could use them open lives to share the gospel.
[time=3415] First they were in Rome, persecution came, Christians were chased out of Rome, they went to Corinth.
[time=3420] There they took in the apostle Paul, they opened up their heart and their home to him, and the church began in Corinth to meet in their home at one point.
[time=3428] Then they moved some time later to Asia, what's now Turkey, and now we read this, it says in the church that meets in their house.
[time=3437] They are open people.
[time=3439] You know, God uses people to win people.
[time=3445] Although God may use a pulpit somewhere to win someone to Christ, he usually does it through personal evangelism.
[time=3453] Although God wins some people to Christ through a literature campaign when things are mailed out, God most often uses the witness of a person.
[time=3462] Although occasionally God uses a television ministry, perhaps like this one to bring someone to Christ.
[time=3469] He usually uses people, people who are open, people who are affectionate, people who are militant, and yet do all things.
[time=3482] In love.
[time=3485] 1 Corinthians 1558 says, "Let us therefore be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord."
[time=3497] One of those qualities is to be lovingly militant.

[time=3538] Before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you. Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3543] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3550] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3553] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me and to forgive me of my sins.
