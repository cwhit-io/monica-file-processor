[time=90] >> The distinction between knowledge and wisdom is not always clear.
[time=110] One man who is known as a brilliant scholar, a genius in his field of study, receives requests
[time=116] from all over the country to come and to speak.
[time=119] From one occasion, he made a great speech, went to the airport and flew home.
[time=125] When he arrived at the airport, he called his wife and said, "Would you pick me up?
[time=128] I'm at the airport." She said, "Honey, I'd love to, but you drove the car to your speaking engagement."
[time=136] He had to get back on another airplane, fly back for his car where he had spoken and then
[time=142] he had to drive back home.
[time=145] Wisdom is the ability to take knowledge and apply it to life.
[time=161] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=166] We're glad you joined us.
[time=168] Today, Rick's message is taken from First Kings, Chapter 3 and is entitled, "What Would You Want?" During our lifetime, we have experienced an explosion of knowledge.
[time=178] We know more now than we ever have known.
[time=181] Many parents find it difficult to help their fifth grade student with his or her homework.
[time=185] Some of our senior adults remember life before the airplane, before the car, and yet their eyes have witnessed a man walking on the moon.
[time=193] There is so much knowledge available today that one writer says that we are suffering from information pollution.
[time=200] But with all our knowledge, there is still a shortage of wisdom.
[time=204] But today, we will begin a new study on the Book of Proverbs, God's Wisdom for the Ages.
[time=210] So that you are able to study with us, please locate your Bible and have it open to First Kings, Chapter 3.
[time=216] We will be looking at verses 1 through 14.
[time=220] We will be hearing special music from our sanctuary choir, our handbell choir, Crystal Hall, and
[time=230] Marilyn Wong.
[time=232] Our Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=240] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=245] Now, here's Rick.
[time=246] In worship service, we trust that God will encourage each heart that's here.
[time=251] We want to welcome you and also welcome our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=256] And it's our prayer and our desire that, first and foremost, God would be glorified today in our singing, in our praying, in our study.
[time=265] And then secondly, each of us would grow in the grace and in the knowledge of the Lord
[time=271] Jesus Christ.
[time=272] The Book of Deuteronomy gave this principle, "To love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[time=278] with all thy soul, and with all of thy might." Jesus was asked, "What is the greatest commandment?" And He gave that exact statement, "To love God with all of our being."
[time=290] Our choir teaches us that truth in this song entitled, "Love God's."
[time=320] And we'll bless you and keep you, and make His say shine upon you, for you are His own,
[time=337] for you are His own.
[time=344] Love God, and the brain is good, and He will prosper you way, day by day, as you walk
[time=365] through His world, for He loves His own, He loves His own, His own.
[time=381] He loves His own, He loves His own, He loves His own, he loves His own, He loves His own
[time=381] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 657 seconds] He loves His own, He loves His own, He loves His own, he loves His own, He loves His own...
[time=1063] He loves His own, He loves His own,
[time=1073] Hello again and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1078] It's always a joy for us to be able to share the Lord Jesus Christ with you through television and often through your letters that come back to us.
[time=1085] We have a letter that we'll be sharing with you later today that was so encouraging but we're glad to have you with us right now.
[time=1092] Pete, we're looking forward to a very special concert coming up on Thursday the 26th.
[time=1097] That's true, Rick, you know, so many of our musicians work and sing Sunday after Sunday and we're so grateful for all the groups that we have and the time that they put in in preparation but we are having a special guest at our church on Thursday evening February 26th.
[time=1111] He'll be here at seven o'clock. His name is Greg Buchanan and he's a harpist.
[time=1116] Now when we think about a harp and I guess we think of it with the orchestra and involved
[time=1122] with other instruments of the orchestra but Greg is a phenomenal harpist and he does many,
[time=1128] many things with the harp. I listened to his record this week and sometimes I really couldn't tell that it was the harp. It sounded like the piano sometime and he's just a brilliant musician who's given his heart to the Lord and his musical talent and he's blessing people across the country with his music and testimony. You know, this same individual, Greg Buchanan, was at the Christian
[time=1148] booksellers convention. One of the men from our church was there and he heard that a harpist was going to be playing. He said, "Well, I'm not sure that I really like a harp." But he went to the concert and he came away saying, "That was a harp." He said it was one of the most exciting music concerts he's been to in a long time. That's right, Rick, and let me encourage those of you that are watching again to set aside Thursday evening, February 26th at 7 p.m. and we'll have the harpist Greg Buchanan
[time=1174] here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and we certainly invite you to come and enjoy a marvelous evening of music. For those of you who regularly watch the Bible Hour, you know that nearly every
[time=1185] Sunday we offer a very helpful piece of literature to you. We often change what the title is and
[time=1191] today we have a new booklet for you that I believe will be of immense help to each of us.
[time=1195] The title is called "Overcoming Depression." Now many of us, when we hear the word depression,
[time=1201] we begin to think immediately of some severe neurosis, somebody who is suffering from paranoia, our manic depression, our form of schizophrenia. Actually, depression is something that usually
[time=1212] grips each one of us from time to time. Maybe we could put it in a softer term, discouragement.
[time=1218] But many of us face those days and sometimes more than days, even weeks where motivation is gone,
[time=1225] joy is gone, the ability to function at our best just isn't there. We're forming a mild case of
[time=1232] depression. It's not anything unusual. All of us will struggle with that. This booklet is designed
[time=1238] to give 10 simple principles that every one of us can do. We can do it alone that will help in a
[time=1244] great way. Of course, if you're suffering from some severe form of depression, we want to encourage
[time=1250] you to seek a Christian counselor immediately. But for those of us who just struggle occasionally
[time=1256] in our Christian life with doubt, discouragement, and mild depression, this book by Tim LaHaye will
[time=1262] go a long way to giving us some principles to get us back moving full speed with full joy once again.
[time=1269] We'd love to send you a copy if you would simply write to us and ask for the booklet on depression.
[time=1274] If you've received discouragement in your life in recent days, let me encourage you to write for this book. You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1286] and the zip code is 46815. That's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=1296] The Bible Hour is broadcast live here in Fort Wayne and then a week later on tape delay in South
[time=1303] Bend and in Marion, Indiana. And we receive a great deal of encouragement and support from a pastor
[time=1310] and a church down in Marion. And it's now our opportunity to support them and to pray for them.
[time=1316] Pete, just tell our friends a little bit about the need. This I received a call last night, Rick, from one of the members of the Sunnycrest Baptist Church where Pastor Morrison is the pastor.
[time=1326] His wife, Carol, is very active in the ongoings of that church, Secretary of the Church, and she's
[time=1332] been involved in the church choir and has come here with their choir several times and we've gotten to know her very well. She's a wonderful lady and we found out last night that she has two tumors
[time=1342] near the brain and she's going to be operated on very soon. And they've asked for churches around
[time=1349] the country to pray that God's hand will be in the operation and that if all goes well that they
[time=1355] can remove the tumors. This is very serious and we want to just encourage everyone that's listening
[time=1361] to pray for Carolyn Morrison. She's the wife of the pastor of the Sunnycrest Baptist Church in Marion, Indiana. We do hope that you'll be praying for that family. They're encouragers of the
[time=1372] Bible hour and friends of all of us, particularly those of you in Marion. And in just a few moments
[time=1378] in the live part of our morning worship service, we'll be praying for her, their family, and others.
[time=1383] I want to encourage you to do the same. Just before we go back to the church service, we want to ask
[time=1389] you to do us a major, major service. We would love to hear from you a letter, a note letting us know
[time=1396] what God has been doing in your life is such an encouragement. This past week, I went through the mail that came in and found this delightful letter, came from a lady right here in Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1407] who wrote and said, "Please send me timeless insights and the booklet your decision because
[time=1413] while I was watching the Bible hour, I made a decision to allow Christ to come into my life."
[time=1419] Well, for us, that's the bottom line. We're here to minister, to encourage, to promote worship,
[time=1425] but more than anything else, to help those of you who are watching who don't know Christ is your Savior to come to that point of decision. We'd love to hear from all of you whether you've made a
[time=1436] decision to accept Christ through the Bible hour or that's been a part of your life for years.
[time=1441] Let us know how God is using this ministry in your life. If you're right to us, we would greatly
[time=1447] appreciate that. Once again, our address is the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1458] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1471] And why I serve the King. I just have to share my thoughts with you and let you know
[time=1481] just why I sing. You see, he reached right down and changed my life. He cared so much for me.
[time=1492] So I'll lift my voice in place to him. Thank you, Lord, for Calvary.
[time=1501] I will praise him as long as I live. I'll serve him, and I'll love him. I'll give all.
[time=1517] I have to give, and I'll lift up my heart and voice and praise him till I die.
[time=1527] Then I'll still be singing this song to him when I meet him in the sky.
[time=1542] Well, my life is so much different now since I found the source of love.
[time=1549] Now it's not an earthly source, my friend, but it's the Savior from above. Now you can have this
[time=1559] life unlimited, abundant, whole and free. Jesus said he came to give us life, a life of joy.
[time=1573] And victory. I will praise him as long as I live. I'll serve him and I'll love him.
[time=1590] I'll give all I have to give, and I'll lift up my heart and voice.
[time=1602] Praise him till I die. Then I'll still be singing this song to him when I meet him in the sky.
[time=1630] I will always praise him.
[time=1646] Thank you, Marilyn. A song both of praise and of anticipation. Praising God for what he's done in
[time=1655] our life and anticipating the day when we see him face to face and behold him. That's our very
[time=1662] purpose for being here today to praise him and to anticipate. Let us bow together in prayer
[time=1668] and invite you to pray with me silently before God.
[time=1698] Jesus, oh, let thy glory have our own resisting. Come, oh, come, Lord Jesus, we ask you to come
[time=1728] this day. You have promised that where two or three are gathered in your name, you would be there.
[time=1734] And so today, Lord Jesus, we meet here in this place in your name, and we ask you to be present,
[time=1742] that we might know you, we might know your power, we might know your peace. Father, today, we've come
[time=1752] to magnify the name of your son and to glorify you, and yet we feel so inadequate in doing that.
[time=1760] Each of us senses a clear unworthiness, an inability to even imagine ourselves before the
[time=1773] God-creator-sustainer. Wow. God, we are overcome with your greatness,
[time=1782] and yet we rejoice in your love. And we today come to reaffirm our faith
[time=1791] to declare our allegiance. God, some of us have compromised this past week. Others of us are on
[time=1801] the very verge of defection, and we've come here today. God is a final effort to rekindle,
[time=1809] to strengthen. So, God, we ask your son Jesus to be present and to fortify our faith,
[time=1818] to encourage that one who is so weary that they want to quit,
[time=1826] to help those who have burnt bridges, to learn to say, "I am sorry, will you forgive?"
[time=1833] Father, today, we would pray for your healing in so many relationships,
[time=1841] fathers and sons who can hardly tolerate being in the same company,
[time=1847] husbands and wives who are only together in their words for the children's sake.
[time=1857] God, pour out your healing. Father, we pray for those who have erred in their walk,
[time=1865] who have heaped upon themselves some grave consequences, that you would turn their hearts with wisdom. I'm rejoicing in Don Maley's growth, Father, and as he faced sentencing,
[time=1880] in these days, we pray that your good and perfect will would be worked out in his life.
[time=1886] God, we pray for those who walk through critical valleys in their health, particularly for Carol Morrison. Your hand would be upon her and our doctors.
[time=1898] We thank you for Keeler Garten's progress and pray that it would continue. We ask you to encourage
[time=1906] Gertrude Geller. She recovers from a surgery. God, each of us need a perspective that stands
[time=1916] taller than us. I do. Now as we open your word, God, we ask you to put into us
[time=1924] some insight for life that would make the difference today. In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1931] Open your Bible, please, to the Book of First Kings. If you're new to our church or if you're new
[time=1939] to Bible study, in the front of most Bibles is a table of contents that will help you find
[time=1945] First Kings. In my Bible, it's about three quarters of an inch from the front, but I don't know if that will help you. First Kings is one of those Old Testament books, and it gets its name because it
[time=1956] tells us about the kings of the nation of Israel. Now while you're looking for that,
[time=1962] let me ask you to do something. If you have a pen or a pencil, take that out, take your bulletin, our piece of scrap paper, and write something down. Write down what it is if you could have this
[time=1974] said to you. You can have anything you want, but just one thing, what would it be? Now take a moment and write that down. If you don't have paper or a pen,
[time=1984] at least very clearly affix that in your mind, what one thing would you like? I'm going to scribble mine down right here. All right. I don't know how to spell it, but I can write it down.
[time=1995] Okay, you've done that. Now about ten minutes ago, we asked you to greet some people around you.
[time=2001] You know everybody around you. Just turn and tell them what it is that you would like. Do that. I know that's risky. One of the single guys in our church wrote down, "I want to date with this girl
[time=2012] next to me," and then he had to tell her. But turn around right now and let some of the people know
[time=2018] what that one wish is. Would you do that right now? What is it? If you could have one thing,
[time=2026] what was it that you would ask for? Well, some honesty, some laughter.
[time=2035] All right. Good. I hope that's helpful to you to identify that one thing that you would want.
[time=2045] Unfortunately, I cannot say to you, line up at the back door and we'll give you what you
[time=2051] ever ask for on your way out today. Not able to do that. But you know, that was the real experience
[time=2058] of a man by the name of Solomon in 1 Kings chapter 3. Turn your Bible, if you will, to 1 Kings chapter
[time=2066] 3 and to verse 4. I'm going to read it for you today in the new international version. It reads
[time=2074] like this. "The king went up to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high
[time=2081] place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. At Gibeon, the Lord
[time=2090] appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream." And God said, "Ask for whatever you want me
[time=2097] to give you." Solomon answered, "You have shown great kindness to your servant. My father David,
[time=2106] because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this
[time=2113] great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on the throne this very day."
[time=2122] "Now, O Lord, my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David,
[time=2129] but I'm only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties.
[time=2135] Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count
[time=2145] or to number. So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people, to distinguish between
[time=2158] right and wrong, for who is able to govern this great people of yours. The Lord was pleased that
[time=2167] Solomon asked for this. So God said to him, "Since you have asked for this and not for long life or
[time=2174] wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies, but for discernment in
[time=2181] administrating justice, I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart
[time=2190] so that there will never have been anyone like you nor will there ever be. Moreover, I will give
[time=2199] you what you have not asked for, both riches and honor, so that in your lifetime you will have no
[time=2207] equal among kings. And if you walk in my ways and obey my statutes and commandments, as David
[time=2217] your father did, I will give you a long life." Well, here's Solomon. We probably have heard his name
[time=2225] before, but many of us wouldn't be able to create much of a biography. He's the king over Israel.
[time=2231] He's the son of David, and he went through the experience and exercise you and I just did, only it wasn't just by way of illustration. It was reality. God said, "Solomon, what is it you
[time=2241] would like?" I just want all of you to know that I put down as my wish I wanted wisdom. Of course,
[time=2247] I knew what the passage said, and I had a head start on you. Perhaps you heard the story about the man who miraculously found this enchanting bottle. We opened it up and this genie came out and said,
[time=2258] "You may have three wishes." Well, instantly, he wished for a new car. There was his new car. He got in and drove away, but he was discouraged to find there was no radio. So he said, "I wish
[time=2269] there was an AM FM stereo cassette recorder." Boom, there it was. Now, he said, "I'm going to think
[time=2276] before I waste my last and final wish." So he was just driving along listening to the radio. A
[time=2282] commercial came on and he began to sing along with the commercial. "Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Meyer wiener." That is what I'd truly like to be. I don't know if you wasted your wish today.
[time=2294] It really doesn't matter. I'm not in the business of granting wishes. And God doesn't invite us to
[time=2302] come to him as though he is a genie or a fairly godmother who dispenses every little wishes.
[time=2308] But to Solomon, he gave that unique privilege of granting a wish. In a word, Solomon wished
[time=2318] for wisdom. To be sure he already had some wisdom, to have the wisdom to ask for wisdom.
[time=2324] A fool wouldn't have even thought of that. But Solomon looked at the task that was before him
[time=2330] and said, "Wow, there's a lot of people here. My dad was a great king. I'm just a young man.
[time=2338] God, I can't handle it. I need the ability to have discernment and to distinguish between right
[time=2346] and wrong." And he asked for wisdom. Well, the good news is this. God not only gave Solomon wisdom,
[time=2354] but he gave him the wisdom to write down his wisdom. And it's all put together in one little book
[time=2360] called The Book of Proverbs. Now, all 31 Proverbs were not written by Solomon. There were some other
[time=2367] contributing editors, but he wrote most of the Proverbs. And they are a collection of the wisdom
[time=2373] that has come from the wisest man who has ever lived. God said, "I'm going to make you wise,
[time=2379] wiser than anyone who's ever preceded you or anyone who will ever follow you." And we have
[time=2385] the privilege of grabbing onto that wisdom. In the next several weeks, we're going to be studying major themes out of the Book of Proverbs. I call it getting a grip on life. But before we do that,
[time=2397] we needed to meet the man who was the author and discover a little bit about wisdom in particular.
[time=2403] The Book of Proverbs is an exciting, practical book. And today I want to introduce you to Proverbs
[time=2410] and tell you a little bit about what a proverb is and what a proverb is not. A proverb according to
[time=2418] Webster is a short pithy saying or a bit of wisdom. And that's a good definition. But when we think
[time=2425] of Proverbs, we need to think of them as more than just a short pithy saying that's wisdom that
[time=2431] comes from God. Proverbs is different than every other book of the Bible. Let me give you four
[time=2437] characteristics. First of all, what a proverb is. A proverb is a short statement. Many of the
[time=2444] passages in the Bible are long-flowing narratives. Do you know that Matthew chapter 5, 6, and 7 was
[time=2451] one sermon that Jesus gave? We call it the Sermon on the Mount. But Proverbs, unlike the Sermon on
[time=2459] the Mount, which was a long-flowing test, most of them just are one little verse that stands on its own and has quite often no relationship to the preceding verses. They're just short, direct little
[time=2470] statements like these. "Spare the rod and spoil the child." As I was growing up, my family was
[time=2478] relatively unchurched and I seriously doubt that my father had any idea what John 3, 16 said.
[time=2485] But he did know at least this one Proverbs, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." Short, simple, but he was able to grasp that. He was also able to grasp me at just the appropriate moment.
[time=2497] The Proverbs by their nature are short little things. Secondly, they're concrete. By that,
[time=2504] I mean that they're clear, simple images that you can picture immediately. They're not abstract
[time=2511] thoughts like Aristotle would say, "What is the true good versus that which is not?" Could you repeat the question? Proverbs aren't like that at all. Proverbs are clear little
[time=2524] statements that you can immediately picture like this one, and I'm sure you won't have any trouble with your imagination picturing it. As a gold ring in the snout of a pig, so is a woman without
[time=2535] discretion. That's kind of clear, isn't it? I don't know about you. I can picture that.
[time=2540] The Proverbs are like that. Or this proverb that says, "Better a dry crust of bread with peace
[time=2550] than feasting with strife." I can picture that one. That's the nature of the Proverbs. They're short,
[time=2559] they're very clear. You just take them at face value. The third thing about Proverbs is that they're
[time=2566] very general. What I mean by that is these are things that are generally true, but not always,
[time=2573] but generally true. Things like this, a soft answer turns away wrath. That's generally true.
[time=2582] If you're in sales and you've got an angry customer and they're calling you up to tell you how bad
[time=2588] they think your company is and how slow production is and delivery is worse, one of the best things you can do is say, "Boy, I understand your frustration. I regret that you
[time=2598] have to tolerate with that and I'll do anything I can to correct the situation." Wow, that soft
[time=2604] answer can really calm things down. But you know, it's just a general principle. It's not always true,
[time=2611] because Jesus answered people with the soft answer and he got hit. But generally, it's true.
[time=2619] Here's another general statement. "When a man's ways please the Lord,
[time=2626] he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him." You know, that's generally true,
[time=2632] but not always. Paul's ways please the Lord and he never made motel reservations. He just stayed
[time=2639] in the local jail. But his ways really did please the Lord. They're generally true. A fourth thing
[time=2647] that's true about a proverb is that they're practical. They're just talking about day to day
[time=2654] living. They're a proverb that tells us about anger. A soft answer turns away wrath. Practical
[time=2660] ones that talk about money, contentment, and greed, spending, borrowing, lending, and co-signing.
[time=2668] Practical advice that talks about the elusiveness of the affair and the importance of saying no.
[time=2675] It talks about promises that are made and then broken and how to deal with friends who did both.
[time=2681] Practical things. A proverb is described as these four ways. It's something short,
[time=2688] something concrete, something general, something practical. Two other descriptions about
[time=2695] proverbs of what a proverb is not. First of all, a proverb is not a law. When you read the book of
[time=2702] proverbs, these are not commandments. God is not saying in Proverbs 6, "Do not ever co-sign."
[time=2710] But God is saying, "Generally, you'll live to regret it." And if you co-sign with somebody
[time=2717] who's a high risk before the paper gets processed, change your mind. But it's not a commandment
[time=2724] that thou shall never co-sign. It's a proverb. But many of the proverbs parallel other passages
[time=2733] of the Bible that are commandments. But the proverb itself is usually not. More importantly,
[time=2741] to remember is this, a proverb is not a promise. It's a general thing that's most often true,
[time=2749] but not always so. We make two mistakes as we come to the Scripture. First of all, we interpret everything as a promise, and many things are not. And secondly, we interpret everything that is
[time=2760] a promise as though it was a promise given to us when it was not. You see, in the book of Proverbs,
[time=2766] it says things that are proverbial true. Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he's old he will not depart from it. That's generally true, but I've met some wonderful godly parents who had some real brats. I'm talking about kids my age. They're the brats. But generally,
[time=2783] that's not true. Generally, if you raise your children, they'll grow up to honor that.
[time=2788] But that's a proverb, not a promise. As I mentioned, the other mistake we make is we take
[time=2797] every promise in the Bible and we personalize it. There's a little children song that sounds
[time=2803] cute. It's unfortunately not true. It goes like this. Every promise in the book is mind, mind, mind. Every verse, every word, every line, line, line. Rhymes sounds good, but it's not true.
[time=2816] And I, for one, am thankful that every promise in the Bible is not true.
[time=2820] Take the problem, the promise that was given to Abraham. God said, "I'll make you a great nation.
[time=2827] I'll multiply your children that there'll be as the stars of the heaven and the sands of the seas.
[time=2832] Thank you, Lord, that belonged to Abraham and not me. I don't want to be a great nation, and I don't want to buy that many Christmas presents. Three is enough for the hawkses." But that was God's promise to Abraham, not to me. Another promise that God made to Abraham,
[time=2847] I particularly would like to avoid. God said, "Abraham, you're a hundred years old and you're going to have a son." That, I would not greet as good news. Fortunately, that belonged to Abraham
[time=2860] and not to you and not to me. You see, when we approach the Scriptures, we've got to approach it, eyes open, thinking. And remember, a proverb is a general rule, not a principle,
[time=2872] or it's a principle and not a promise. Now go back to 1 Kings chapter 3, and we're going to talk a little bit about Solomon and this great gift of wisdom. 1 Kings chapter 3, as we've read it,
[time=2885] let me give you this simple outline that will help you follow the flow. First of all,
[time=2891] God reveals a choice. God came to Solomon, this time it was in the form of a dream,
[time=2899] and he gave to him a choice. His choice was that he could choose anything that he wanted.
[time=2909] Verses four through five give us that choice, and God said, "Ask for whatever you want
[time=2916] me to give you." It was reality. It wasn't just the exercise we did a few moments ago, but God says, "Choose it." He gave him a choice. God is a God who gives choices.
[time=2929] Now he doesn't give us all the choice that he gave Solomon. I don't think there's anyone in this auditorium that God has said, "Ask whatever you want and I'll give it to you." If there is, by any chance, would you see me and at least consider some of my suggestions?
[time=2945] But God still gives each of us choices. Every day of our life we live a life of choice.
[time=2951] God could have made us robotic in nature, that we follow him instinctively, intuitively,
[time=2959] and mechanically without regard to any personal preference. I'm thankful he gave us choice.
[time=2965] Here God revealed to Solomon that he had a choice, and then secondly we find the request
[time=2974] that Solomon gave. It describes himself as young and inadequate. It's always great to find humility
[time=2983] in a king. If there's anything that will mark us apart as leaders, as men and women for Christ,
[time=2994] it will be an obvious humility that's sincere. I find disgusting a pious pride.
[time=3006] That wasn't Solomon's case. He just generally looked at the task and he looked at himself and
[time=3012] he said, "Oh boy, I'm the boy. I can't handle it." So he requested something. He asked for a discerning
[time=3022] heart, insight, in a single word he asked for wisdom. We live in a world where knowledge
[time=3032] is exploding around us. We live in a time where it's not just the amount of knowledge,
[time=3038] but it's the acceleration of knowledge that is absolutely overwhelming. Do you know that there are people in this church who are of the senior generation and they remember when the right
[time=3050] brothers were grounded and in their lifetime they have seen by way of television a man walk on the
[time=3060] moon. In our lifetime technology and knowledge have exploded to a point that many writers say
[time=3069] we live in a time of information pollution. We are flooded with so much meaningful factual data that we can't even digest and assimilate at all. And many, many of the people in this congregation
[time=3081] are absolutely brilliant. Some of you in your fields of business have knowledge and professional
[time=3089] insight that's second to none. Others of you have taken great academic disciplines. You have trained
[time=3097] your mind and you have acquired knowledge. But there's a difference between knowledge and wisdom.
[time=3104] Knowledge is simply the acquiring of facts and wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge into
[time=3115] successful, godly living. There was a man who was a great scholar, a genius and a very gifted
[time=3123] communicator. So gifted and so scholarly that people from all over the country asked him to come and speak. He made a trip, made a marvelous presentation, received the approval and the applause
[time=3134] of the crowd. He went home, landed at the airport, picked up the fay phone and called his wife and
[time=3142] said, "I'm at the airport. Could you come pick me up now?" She said, "Honey, I'd love to come pick you up, but you have the car. You drove it to your speaking engagement." You had to get back
[time=3153] on an airplane, fly where he was, find his car and drive it home. Brilliant mind, genius. He just
[time=3160] flunked the game of life. He had knowledge but very little practical wisdom. Solomon rightfully
[time=3169] asked for wisdom, the ability to discern between right and wrong. Third thing, let's note this,
[time=3176] God's response. The Bible says in verses 10 through 13, first of all, God was pleased.
[time=3183] Wouldn't it be great if right now somebody was standing before God and mentioned your name.
[time=3190] God said, "I'm pleased with that guy. I'm really pleased with her." The words of Jesus,
[time=3200] well done. Now good and faithful servant. God was pleased with Solomon and he was not only pleased
[time=3207] with Solomon for what he asked for wisdom but for what he did not ask for. He did not ask for
[time=3213] the proverbial Christmas list. Money, a little more money, car, a little nicer car, a little
[time=3219] bigger house, nor did he ask for wealth or health. Or on the negative side he didn't say,
[time=3229] "Yeah, God, none of you mentioned there are these three guys that have given me grief all my life, given grief for me." God was pleased with what he asked for and what he didn't ask for.
[time=3243] It would be a great thing to take our prayer life and to do a similar inventory and see how many times we pray for health and wealth and miss the wisdom that God wants to give us.
[time=3256] Solomon rightly asked for wisdom and that pleased God. Please God so much. God said, "I'm going to give you the wisdom like nobody else has ever had it and moreover, I'm going to give you what you didn't ask for. I'm going to give you a long, prosperous life." And then finally in form of an outline, Solomon's responsibility. Notice verse 14,
[time=3280] keyword in this whole passage I think is the little two-letter word if and if you walk in my ways
[time=3290] and obey my statutes and commandments as David your father did, I will give you a long life.
[time=3297] Obviously there are two types of promises God gives. A promise that is unconditional. God says,
[time=3306] "I'm going to do this for you. Doesn't matter what you do, I'm going to do it." And then a conditional promise where God says, "I'm going to do this if you will." And the promise
[time=3318] is contingent upon our fulfilling of a condition. If you know Solomon's life, you know that he was
[time=3325] blessed with great wisdom but he also made some serious mistakes. And one has to ask the question,
[time=3332] "How can the wisest man ever to have lived do such foolish things?" And the answer is found that
[time=3339] when he was irresponsible, the wisdom was lacking. Allow me to draw this down to three practical
[time=3348] applications. Application number one is in Proverbs 1 verse 7. We've seen it in a biography of Solomon.
[time=3356] It says this, "The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord." If you would want to be wise
[time=3362] today, then it's going to start not with your MBA, it's not going to start with your PhD,
[time=3369] it's not going to start with your graduate program, it's going to start when you say,
[time=3375] "God, I recognize you as my ruler, maker, and sovereign God, and I will honor you with my life."
[time=3384] Wisdom will not begin until God is placed on the throne of your life. You may be smart,
[time=3391] you may be smarter than I are smart, but that's knowledge. And wisdom comes when you
[time=3402] put God in the person of his son at the very center of your life.
[time=3409] Practical application number two is this, that wisdom is developed and retained by the walk
[time=3416] of obedience. He said, "Solomon, if you walk in my commandments, then all of this is going
[time=3422] to happen, but you take one step out of it and you're on your own." And a biography of Solomon's
[time=3428] life is one of high extremes, almost divergent personalities. On one day, he's giving the greatest
[time=3436] insight and wisdom ever, and on the next day, he's marrying his 395th wife. In total violation,
[time=3443] everything God had said about purity. Why? Because he didn't walk in the work. If you want to be
[time=3451] wise today, beloved, you've got to walk in the Word. Many of us are in desperate need of wisdom,
[time=3458] not knowledge. Some of you are flirting with a temptation. You have carried it in your mind and
[time=3465] you have caressed it, and now it is like sin wanting to burst forth in the life,
[time=3471] and your head has already rationalized it. Your will has already made its choice,
[time=3480] and it's calling you to take that plunge of sin. And you desperately need wisdom to walk
[time=3490] in obedience. Wisdom comes by obedience.
[time=3500] It's been a special blessing for us to present the music from the handbell choir and our soloists
[time=3511] today, and then the message from God's Word from our pastor Rick Hawks. If as a result of today's
[time=3517] program, you've made a decision concerning your life with Christ. I'd like to take a moment and pray with you before we close. Would you bow your heads and pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father,
[time=3527] we rejoice when somebody comes to know you as personal Savior. And today, if there's anyone
[time=3533] that senses a need for Christ to come into their hearts, I pray that they will pray this prayer.
[time=3538] Father, I'm a sinner. I know that I have sinned in my life, and I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of my sin. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. We are always pleased when you make a
[time=3552] decision such as that, and we are also thankful when you write us and tell us the nature of your decision. And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God. To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet
[time=3568] mentioned earlier by Dr. Tim Lehay entitled "10 Steps to Victory Over Depression," please write
