[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=60] There are no locks on the doors to wisdom, knowledge and insight.
[time=75] God said they're here.
[time=77] They're yours for the digging.
[time=90] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=95] We're glad you've joined us this morning.
[time=97] Today Rick's message is taken from Proverbs chapter 1 and is entitled "Wisdom, Insight that Makes the Difference." In James chapter 1 verse 5, God invites us to ask Him for wisdom.
[time=111] Most often He chooses to answer us through His Word.
[time=114] In particular, the Book of Proverbs is God's wisdom for all ages.
[time=119] Today we begin a new study in this very practical book by studying these timeless principles God can help us get a grip on our lives.
[time=128] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Proverbs chapter 1.
[time=133] We will be looking at verses 20 through 33.
[time=137] Our special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir.
[time=143] Celebration and Lynn Roll.
[time=150] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=159] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=164] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour and trust that by way of television we can have a ministry of encouragement to each life.
[time=174] We're delighted that you're here in this place because Jesus promised that we're two or three or gathered in His name, that He would uniquely bless that location with His own personal presence in a way that He's differently present than the fact that He's in each of our hearts.
[time=191] He has promised to meet with us today.
[time=193] This auditorium is a very basic building.
[time=196] It's a gym more days than it's a sanctuary.
[time=199] It's just a building.
[time=201] But when Jesus Christ blesses us with His presence it's transformed into Holy Ground.
[time=207] And we are standing in His presence today in Holy Ground.
[time=228] As I walk through the door,
[time=234] I sense His presence.
[time=240] And I knew this was a place
[time=246] with a heart.
[time=252] For this is a temple, temple of God, the high sea.
[time=264] We are standing in His presence
[time=270] from Holy Ground.
[time=276] We are standing on Holy Ground.
[time=289] And I know that there are angels of the realm.
[time=315] We are standing in His presence on Holy Ground.
[time=327] In His presence there is joy beyond measure.
[time=340] And that His feet, feet of mind can still be found.
[time=353] If you have the need, I know He has the answer.
[time=364] Just reach out and claim it child.
[time=369] You're standing on Holy Ground.
[time=377] We are standing in His presence
[time=384] on Holy Ground.
[time=390] And I know that there are angels of the realm.
[time=402] And that our prayer is Jesus now.
[time=414] We are standing in His presence
[time=420] on Holy Ground.
[time=426] We are standing on Holy Ground.
[time=440] And I know that there are angels of the realm.
[time=453] We are standing in His presence.
[time=485] on Holy Ground.
[time=507] Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty.
[time=510] Him number nine, continue to celebrate the holiness of God as we sing the first, second, and fourth stanza.
[time=537] Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty.
[time=622] Holy Lord Almighty.
[time=649] Holy, Holy Christ Almighty.
[time=663] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=665] Just a couple of weeks ago, Pastor Rick was speaking about the responsibilities in Heaven, and he suggested that the music directors would continue to have a job.
[time=674] There was plenty of room for choir directors, and then I'd be working in Heaven.
[time=678] Just last week in the kindergarten class, one of the young girls said to her teacher that she was very concerned
[time=684] that all of us were going to be enjoying Heaven and that Mr. Colby had to continue working.
[time=690] The teacher assured her that it would be a marvelous opportunity to lead redeemed saints,
[time=696] and I agree with her that what a privilege it would be to have all of us singing the praises to our God.
[time=702] A little later on, they went to prayer, and this young lady could not get it out of her mind, so she continued to pray for Mr. Colby that he would enjoy his job in Heaven.
[time=712] I think I'll enjoy it, and I would have the privilege.
[time=715] If this is anything like a little bit of a taste of Heaven, when we sing together the praises,
[time=721] it'll be marvelous up there.
[time=723] Sometimes we think that God only does good things to people who do not honor Him.
[time=729] But I don't think that's true.
[time=730] I think God knows everything that happens to us.
[time=733] Nothing good, nothing bad, takes place without our Father knowing about it.
[time=738] Let's listen to that theme as celebration sings for us.
[time=742] Nothing will happen to me today.
[time=750] Nothing good, nothing bad.
[time=753] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=760] Nothing will happen to me today.
[time=764] Nothing good, nothing bad.
[time=768] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=774] There were three men who lived a long time ago.
[time=777] Shat racked me, shacked up, that nickel.
[time=781] They would not bow to the idol that day, and from the flames of the furnace you could hear each one say.
[time=789] Nothing will happen to me today.
[time=793] Nothing good, nothing bad.
[time=797] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=803] Then there was Daniel who prayed every day.
[time=806] The decree of the king, he just would not obey.
[time=810] When they decided to put him away above the roar of the lions you could hear Daniel say.
[time=819] Nothing will happen to me today.
[time=823] Nothing good, nothing bad.
[time=826] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=833] Nothing will happen to me today.
[time=836] Nothing good, nothing bad.
[time=840] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=846] Nothing will happen to me today.
[time=850] Nothing good, nothing bad.
[time=853] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=860] Nothing will happen to me today.
[time=863] Nothing good, nothing bad.
[time=866] Nothing will happen to me today without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=872] Without passing through my Father's hands.
[time=879] Good morning and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=888] We're looking forward to sharing this whole hour with you and trust that God's already encouraged you through the ministry of music that you've heard so far.
[time=897] Pete, I've enjoyed that song Holy Ground quite often and that is a great song of praise.
[time=902] Yes it is, Rick.
[time=903] We were studying about it this week and just finding some scriptures and where the Lord is that can certainly be Holy Ground and we can worship His Holy Name.
[time=911] And this has been a great day as all weeks are as we celebrate together the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=918] It is exciting.
[time=919] There's not anything greater than to worship the Lord.
[time=922] God has made us for that purpose and there's an inner joy that cannot be compared to in any other way when we worship Him.
[time=930] We're having a special worship service with Greg Buchanan coming up in a few weeks.
[time=935] Rick there are many avenues to serve the Lord as the Psalm in particular Psalm 150 mentions all the instruments of the orchestra and using our voices and everything we can to serve the Lord.
[time=946] We're excited about the ministry of Greg Buchanan as he comes and performs with us on the harp.
[time=951] That will be Thursday evening February 26th at the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church and that program begins at 7 p.m.
[time=960] Rick Greg is in Los Angeles right now and he's beginning his tour this week and coming across the country to New York.
[time=967] He was at the Christian Booksellers Convention this summer in Washington DC and is just a world-renowned harpist and we have the privilege of having him here on Thursday evening.
[time=977] Well you don't normally think of a harp as a solo instrument but we are really looking forward to that special opportunity.
[time=984] I want to encourage you to join us on Thursday evening. I know if you're watching in some of the outlying areas that will be a trip worth the taking.
[time=992] That's special to have him here on a Thursday so that we're not competing with your home church on a Sunday or a Sunday night.
[time=999] So Thursday night the 26th of February at 7 o'clock right here we'll be hosting Greg Buchanan.
[time=1006] I want to encourage you to come as well. Last week we asked you to pray for Carol Morrison and we want to thank you.
[time=1013] She has done marvelously through surgery and the prognosis has much improved. We want to thank you for your prayers.
[time=1020] And then ask you to pray for another friend today. We're a little short-handed here this morning but that's not as important as the need.
[time=1027] Ed Richard one of our technical people who coordinates a lot of the efforts of the Bible hour is home this morning.
[time=1034] Their daughter is in the hospital and we've been praying for them and need to keep doing that.
[time=1038] Yes Rick, Audra has had some difficulties and she is in the hospital.
[time=1043] They're taking tests trying to determine just what the problem is and she's been a very sick little girl.
[time=1048] And we need to pray for Ed and Marsha the parents and also for Audra that God will intervene and heal her
[time=1055] so that the doctors will have the wisdom to know how to treat this illness.
[time=1059] And we'll pray for her in just a moment but we wanted to ask you to be doing that also.
[time=1064] This morning we have a booklet that we want to share with you that I believe will be of tremendous help to every one of us.
[time=1070] The title may intimidate you because it deals with depression and I personally don't feel like I'm depressed and you probably don't either.
[time=1079] But this booklet is designed to help each of us to make it through the valleys in life.
[time=1084] I wish that life was just a constant steady climb upward but for all of us there's some downturns and some returns up and then down.
[time=1091] How do you deal with those valley experiences?
[time=1094] This booklet is called Ten Steps to Victory Over Depression.
[time=1099] Now if you're suffering from a form of diagnosed depression such as manic depression or a form of paranoia,
[time=1107] please know that you're going to need more help than this booklet.
[time=1110] But for those of us who are going through life at somewhat of a normal pace but face occasional downturns,
[time=1117] maybe we would better call it discouragement.
[time=1120] This book is a great help.
[time=1122] It comes from Tim Lahay, one of the finest biblical teachers on our emotions that I know of and it's simple.
[time=1129] You don't have to be a scholar, you don't have to look up medical terms the whole way through.
[time=1134] It's just a clear book of wisdom on dealing with depression and discouragement.
[time=1140] And we'd love to send you a copy.
[time=1143] This booklet can be an encouragement today for you and we'd like to have you right to the Bible Hour,
[time=1149] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1155] The booklet is entitled Ten Steps to Victory Over Depression and again you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour,
[time=1162] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1168] As you were just looking at that booklet, Ten Steps to Victory Over Depression, you saw that it was silhouetted over the Bible.
[time=1176] And we believe that everything that is taught whether it is psychology or sociology, whether it's philosophy of government or philosophy of life, is something that has to be first integrated through the Bible.
[time=1188] That's God's word of wisdom and if it doesn't pass the biblical test, then we would not encourage you to follow it.
[time=1195] But this book does and we hope it will be a big help to every one of us who struggle with a normal degree of discouragement.
[time=1201] I for one face that from time to time and I'm sure you do too.
[time=1205] So if you would like a copy, please write to us today at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=1216] Thank you for joining us and as we go back to our morning worship service, we're looking forward to music and a message that we trust will build wisdom into each of our lives.
[time=1226] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=1414] - Thank you, Lynn.
[time=1422] Let us pray together.
[time=1424] God, you've transformed our usual meeting spot
[time=1430] into Holy Ground by Your presence, and we've come to worship You.
[time=1435] We sense that we are here today in Holy Ground because of the glory of who You are.
[time=1443] Father, we've come to worship You and to praise You for Your unfailing, unchanging character.
[time=1451] God, we thank You that You've changed not in the world that relationships that seem so solid then fail, that we can come to You and find You never failing.
[time=1463] Father, we thank You for the confidence we can have that You're in control and that though we may not like all that life serves us, we know that nothing good, nothing bad can happen to us today without passing through Your hands.
[time=1483] God, that gives us confidence and we praise You for that.
[time=1489] Father, we give You the adoration of our soul.
[time=1494] You have made us and we sense that we belong to You.
[time=1497] You've given us that by instinct.
[time=1499] And yet, God, today, some would rebel.
[time=1504] They would find it offensive to think of You as Lord of their life.
[time=1510] Others would even glory in the title, Rebel.
[time=1513] So, God, we ask You to speak to hearts and to souls at the depth of a human's being to sense the majesty of who You are.
[time=1526] Father, we would pray today that You would give us insight and wisdom for life.
[time=1531] Not just that we would know, but that we would know how to and not just that we would want, but we would want to.
[time=1538] God, give us discipline to bring our lives into harmony with the principles of Your Word so that You can bless us.
[time=1547] Father, today, we would ask for discernment to our minds and discretion to our choices.
[time=1557] Father, we pray for those who are really struggling with various habits of sin that have grabbed them and held them captive.
[time=1566] Some are in midst of an emotional and tangling affair that You have so clearly called sin and they refuse to admit it and to flee from it.
[time=1576] Others are caught into the trap of work
[time=1582] that instead of working for life, they are living for work.
[time=1586] Others are enslaved by their own anger and temper.
[time=1591] Others are addicted to alcohol or drugs or to pornography.
[time=1596] God, we would ask that Your Spirit would send liberty and set captives free and give discretion to their choices.
[time=1605] Father, we would pray for those who are suffering today, for surely and neither Hershey, as they have lost a loved one.
[time=1613] Again, we pray for Ed and Marcher Richards who are not well themselves and their little girls hospitalized that you would give wisdom to their doctors to treat her.
[time=1623] Father, we would pray today for those who've lost loved ones.
[time=1628] This time of year for many is a grim reminder of the separation and the loss.
[time=1636] We ask You as the God of all comfort to be that to them today.
[time=1642] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1644] If you have your Bible, please open it to the Book of Proverbs in the first chapter.
[time=1652] If you open your Bible to the middle most often, you'll come to a book called The Book of Psalms, PSALMS.
[time=1659] The next book after that is The Book of Proverbs, very near to the center of your Bible.
[time=1664] Proverbs chapter one, I would like to read for you verses 20 through verses 33, and I'm reading today from what's called a new international translation.
[time=1676] A lot of good translations.
[time=1677] I use this one a lot simply because it's readable in today's English.
[time=1683] It's not necessarily putting another translation down, just explaining to you that we use several, and this is a good one.
[time=1690] Proverbs one, verse 20 reads, wisdom calls aloud in the streets.
[time=1698] She raises her voice in the public squares, at the head of the noisy streets.
[time=1704] She cries out in the gateways of the city.
[time=1709] She makes her speech.
[time=1712] How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?
[time=1716] How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?
[time=1722] If you had responded to my rebuke,
[time=1728] I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you, but since you rejected me, when I called, and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,
[time=1744] since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke, I in turn will laugh at your disaster.
[time=1757] I will mock when calamity overtakes you.
[time=1760] When calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and troubles overwhelm you.
[time=1774] Then they will call to me, but I will not answer.
[time=1780] They will look for me, but will not find me.
[time=1786] Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord, since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,
[time=1796] they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes for the waywardness of the simple will kill them and the complacency of fools will destroy them, but whosoever listens to me will live in safety
[time=1816] and be at peace without fear of harm.
[time=1820] In the book of Proverbs it has its very central theme, wisdom,
[time=1826] and in several passages like this one, wisdom is personified.
[time=1831] Personification means that you take something that is not alive and bring it to life.
[time=1838] Here wisdom is viewed as a lady who has a voice and who actually goes out into the streets and calls and a voice that we need to hear and a call that we need to heed.
[time=1849] Picture this in your mind.
[time=1853] It's just a few days before Christmas, and you're at Glenbrook Mall.
[time=1860] I wish that on none of you.
[time=1862] I do not believe in purgatory, but if there is such a place, that is it.
[time=1871] You're at this mall, you and your small son, and the crowd is just moving literally in every direction.
[time=1878] There's no sense of traffic flow.
[time=1879] People are just walking, trying to get everywhere and tripping all over each other, and you can feel the constant rub of shoulders and the push of another person's weight against you.
[time=1890] Through all this, you've got a good grip on your little one and he's reluctantly shopping with you.
[time=1896] And as you begin to rearrange the packages in your arms, you release that young hand just for a moment, but a moment was a little longer than you thought.
[time=1906] You assumed he was right there by your side and now you look down and he's not there.
[time=1911] Most of us have had that experience.
[time=1915] At first, we begin to look with a sense of reserve.
[time=1919] There are others around here and we don't want to cause too much of a scene, so we're looking.
[time=1924] It's conspicuous that we're looking desperately and we're not seeing our son.
[time=1930] But still with a voice of reserve, we say, Adam, Adam, hoping that this little blond hair blue-eyed guy is going to peek around the corner any moment now, say, here I am, but he doesn't.
[time=1945] And so you look into this store and you see no little heads and you look over here and you don't see him.
[time=1950] And now you realize that you're the one doing the pushing and the shoving.
[time=1953] You're the one trying to desperately get through the crowd and no longer is there a reserve in your voice.
[time=1959] There's an obvious desperation.
[time=1961] As you start calling out Adam, where are you?
[time=1964] Desperate hopes that he'll hear your voice
[time=1970] and he'll respond and that voice is calling us today like the desperate call of a mother.
[time=1977] Wisdom is saying, my son, my daughter, please listen.
[time=1982] This is the message of life and if you'll heat it, your life will prosper and if you ignore this, your life will be filled with the calamity of a barn destroyed by a whirlwind.
[time=1996] And like a mother calling her lost son, wisdom is calling.
[time=2002] With no reserve, no cautiousness, she's pleading for her undivided attention.
[time=2010] And the wisdom of God is available to us.
[time=2014] There are no locks on the doors to God's wisdom and to God's knowledge.
[time=2021] Just a simple opportunity to know it, to hear it, and most importantly to heat it.
[time=2029] I'd like to share four things with you about wisdom this morning.
[time=2034] I fear we'll only get through three, but maybe you'll come back sometime to hear that fourth.
[time=2040] These things about wisdom.
[time=2041] First of all, the book of Proverbs tells us the purpose of wisdom.
[time=2045] In chapter one, verses one through six, it says this.
[time=2049] These writings that we're about to receive are the Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel.
[time=2056] And now look at these next verses.
[time=2058] For attaining wisdom, for understanding words, for acquiring a disciplined life, verse four, for giving prudence to the simple.
[time=2069] And then verse six, for understanding Proverbs and parables.
[time=2072] In my translation, that word four occurs five times.
[time=2077] You may have the King James, and you'll find the word two.
[time=2079] T-O occurs in those same five places, five times.
[time=2084] Two are four.
[time=2087] Well, you don't have to be a grammatical expert to discover that the words two and four each introduce to us what's called a purpose clause.
[time=2096] And right here at the very front of this book of wisdom, God wants us to know what the purpose of wisdom is, and there's a fivefold purpose for us to see here.
[time=2105] First of all, it says, for attaining wisdom and discipline.
[time=2109] I'd like to say that the first purpose of wisdom is to give us direction for our lives.
[time=2118] All of us have devoted our life to something.
[time=2122] Just a week ago, we had the privilege of being with some friends at the Philharmonic, and we saw one of the greatest violin players alive today play the violin.
[time=2132] He could stroke that bow so slowly and make the most consistent of sound, and then he could take that bone, he could move it so fast, you could hardly see it moving, making a rapid variety of sounds.
[time=2146] Why the fingers on the neck were moving so fast that you had no idea what he was doing.
[time=2151] Just on appreciation, not only for the sound, but almost the sheer magic of his hands on that instrument.
[time=2160] Why, I tried playing a violin one time, and I made a sound, it was none too pleasant.
[time=2168] What was the difference?
[time=2171] Well, I'm sure that his violin cost more than the beginner's violin in my nieces that I was stroking, but it probably wasn't the instrument.
[time=2180] It was obviously that one set of hands had devoted their lives to playing that instrument where another thought, "Hmm, I'll try that once." Each of us have devoted our lives to something.
[time=2195] This man had devoted his life to the violin.
[time=2198] Some of you have devoted your life to your business.
[time=2203] Some of us have devoted our lives to our children.
[time=2207] Some of us have devoted our lives to doing as little as possible and getting by.
[time=2212] Some of us are working harder at trying to do less than if we had to just work harder doing the right thing.
[time=2219] But all of us are devoting our lives to something, and wisdom is that ability to devote your life, your time, your energy, and every one of your resources in the right place.
[time=2234] How important that is.
[time=2235] I've shared this with you before, but I like it so well, I just wanna give it to you again.
[time=2240] It comes from E.V. Hill, one of the great preachers of America who said this, "The problem with the proverbial ladder of success is once you climb it to the top, you discover that somebody leaned it against the wrong wall." Wisdom is that direction for life
[time=2262] that tells us where to devote our lives.
[time=2264] That's the purpose of this book.
[time=2267] God wants you to know where to apply your energy, where to spend your resources, how to use your time.
[time=2275] What's going to count?
[time=2276] Not just now, but for tomorrow and tomorrow's tomorrow's, and most importantly for eternity, direction for life.
[time=2284] Second thing, here in verse two, it says for understanding words of insight, I say that that wisdom is to give us discernment to our minds.
[time=2294] Understanding word of insight, I believe means to have the ability to see beyond the obvious.
[time=2301] A person who has insight is a person who not only sees what's being given to us as face value, but who sees the downstream implications of all of their thinking.
[time=2313] Not just what will happen now, but what will happen in the future.
[time=2317] It's the ability to look beyond the immediate
[time=2323] and the obvious, those downstream abilities.
[time=2327] God wants to give us a sense of discernment, so that when we're making our steps and our choices through life, we're not just making them with reaction to what everybody else is doing.
[time=2342] We're not making them simply because that's the steps that we always thought we would take when we came to this crossroad, but there's a sense of discernment in our thinking.
[time=2351] Not that we're judgmental in the critical sense, but that we are judgment in the sense that we think through each move before it's made.
[time=2361] A third purpose says this in verse three, that it's to give discipline to our steps.
[time=2369] For acquiring or a discipline in prudent life, doing what's right, just and fair, do you want an exercise that you won't like?
[time=2378] It's worse than push-ups and sit-ups.
[time=2380] Take out a piece of paper and write down all the things you know to do and that you don't do.
[time=2385] My list was embarrassing.
[time=2388] Just a few of the highlights.
[time=2391] I know that when you take out your checkbook and you write a check, you need to flip it back to the ledger section, record what that check is and then subtract out the balance.
[time=2403] I know to do that.
[time=2404] Why don't I?
[time=2407] Discipline.
[time=2410] It is far easier to take those few seconds, maybe 10 at the most to write down Rogers, food, too much and balance it.
[time=2421] Few seconds and that's so much easier than sitting down at the desk three days later.
[time=2429] Honey, do you remember who checked 55, 37 was written to and how much?
[time=2436] I know to do that stuff, but I don't.
[time=2441] That's discipline or the lack of it.
[time=2443] I know to stop after one trip through the buffet line, but I have this inner urge to punish the manager for offering so much food at one price.
[time=2455] But I know not to do that, but I still go back.
[time=2461] I know to stop and to think and even to pray before I correct my kids, but I usually don't.
[time=2471] I know that it's needful for me to exercise every day, even if it's just 10 minutes.
[time=2479] But when I have those 10 minutes, I tend to lay down to the urge passes.
[time=2482] But I know to do those exercises, but I don't.
[time=2488] I know that when I've got a list of jobs to do, the right thing to do is to do the most important one first, but I always gravitate to the easiest one.
[time=2501] If you're a student today and you've got homework in three classes and you can snap it off in two and you really need to struggle and work over the third one, do that third one first.
[time=2510] Get it done.
[time=2513] I know to do that, but I don't.
[time=2516] What's missing?
[time=2519] Well, it's not knowledge.
[time=2520] I already know what the right moves are.
[time=2523] What's missing is the discipline to do the right thing.
[time=2527] Proverbs are given for giving us the ability to acquire discipline and a prudent life so that you'll do what's right and fair and just instead of what's easy and gratifying.
[time=2539] Yet we usually don't do it.
[time=2541] A fourth purpose is found in verse four, another fourth in verse four, for giving prudence to the simple and knowledge and discretion to the young.
[time=2554] This fourth purpose of wisdom is to give discretion to our choices.
[time=2560] Every one of us are going to make countless choices today.
[time=2565] Some of them seem minor and inconsequential.
[time=2568] Some of those have relative significance and many of those are life-changing choices.
[time=2572] And we need to have discretion.
[time=2575] Most of us are guilty of never deferring pleasure.
[time=2582] My children get a dollar allowance every week.
[time=2586] Some of you would like to get off so cheap.
[time=2589] I'm not saying they earn it, I'm just saying they get it.
[time=2592] They get that dollar bill and they're already handling it and talking about going to the store right now.
[time=2598] And so Kathy and I appeal to them now, you could take your money and you could spend it now or you could save it.
[time=2604] And you could save up over a few weeks and you could buy something really neat and something special.
[time=2609] We make this thing sound like it's the Taj Mahal.
[time=2612] You know, I'm gonna save them.
[time=2613] Kathy's giving the speech and I'm in the background going save your money, save your money, save your money.
[time=2619] And at the end of that speech, the question comes out, do you want to go to the store now or do you want to save your money for this special thing?
[time=2626] Let's go to the store now.
[time=2628] You know what, they're five years old
[time=2634] but there aren't many that are 65 that are much different.
[time=2637] We've never learned to defer pleasure and to hold off gratification because we don't have discretion in our choices.
[time=2647] And sometimes that lack of discretion becomes consequential.
[time=2652] It ruins relationships, it damages our testimony.
[time=2655] It's an outright violation of God's standards for which we will pay.
[time=2661] But wisdom says, I want to give you discretion in your choices and notice the different groups of people that this is addressed to giving prudence to the simple.
[time=2674] The simple guy, it's not necessarily dumb.
[time=2676] She's not necessarily stupid.
[time=2678] Simple just means they haven't been experiencing all the complexities of life.
[time=2684] They think that everybody's honest.
[time=2686] They're simple.
[time=2688] This is the inexperienced person.
[time=2691] And the person who's young, my and youth, how we need discretion.
[time=2697] You know, when you're only 14 years old, the year seems like a long time.
[time=2701] When you're 55, a year doesn't seem like such a long time because it's only one 55th of your life but when you're 14, that's one 14th of your life.
[time=2711] And so when you're young, you need to learn early the principle of deferring pleasure and gratification.
[time=2717] But look again at verse five.
[time=2722] It says, listen, not just those who are simple and young but let the wise listen and add to their learning and let those who already have some discernment, let them get guidance.
[time=2734] Many of you, perhaps most of you here today are older than I am and I respect you.
[time=2741] I respect your maturity and your wisdom and many of you have a treasury of knowledge on which I've leaned often.
[time=2748] But just because you do have wisdom and you've got some knowledge, don't shut the machinery down.
[time=2759] Keep the car running on all eight cylinders.
[time=2762] It's too soon to quit growing in the principles of life.
[time=2766] Some of the most difficult choices and decisions you'll ever make in life will be the ones you make after age 65.
[time=2774] God's word is full of wisdom and the purpose of that wisdom
[time=2780] is to give us discretion to our choices.
[time=2783] And then this fifth purpose is found in verse six where understanding proverbs and parables, sayings and riddles of the wise.
[time=2791] Do you know that not all wisdom comes simple?
[time=2794] I mean, there are some simple basic truths in life and I'm thankful because I need to keep it simple.
[time=2800] But you know, there are some things in life that are like Latin, they come hard.
[time=2804] I don't know about you, but I didn't like Latin too at all.
[time=2808] Most people who get D's in Latin one don't like Latin too.
[time=2812] That came tough to me.
[time=2817] And I'm not here to promote ancient languages today, but can I tell you that those two years that I suffered in Mr. Howard's Latin class, they have served me well.
[time=2827] They really have.
[time=2829] I learned more English in Latin than I did in English class.
[time=2832] But it came hard.
[time=2835] Some of the lessons that God has for us require development of our minds.
[time=2842] It's not just for simple free thinkers who wanna catch the truth fast.
[time=2847] It's for people who have keen insight and God's wisdom will help develop that.
[time=2853] I'm dying to tell you this story.
[time=2856] This Buckeye from Ohio went into a little cafe
[time=2862] where he saw a lot of Hoosiers and he was sitting there having the ball suit and he said to the waiter, "Hey, would you like to hear a good Hoosier joke?" The waiter looked a little bit upset about the even suggestion of a Hoosier joke.
[time=2875] He said, "You look over in that corner.
[time=2876] "You see those two big guys?" The guy said, "Yeah?" He said, "Those two guys are ex-Hockey players.
[time=2882] "They are mean.
[time=2884] "They beat people up and they're Hoosiers." You see those other two guys over there?
[time=2890] They're ex-marines.
[time=2890] They've been through the war.
[time=2891] They've seen death and dying and they're twice as mean as those hockey players and they're Hoosiers.
[time=2896] And I'm a Hoosier.
[time=2900] Now, do you want to tell that joke in here?
[time=2902] The guy said, "No.
[time=2904] "I don't want to have to explain it five times." (audience laughing) Now, you can go home and tell that on this Hoosier who went over to Ohio and told a Buckeye joke.
[time=2913] You know, there's some of us that we aren't going to catch it the first time.
[time=2919] Someone's always having to explain it to us.
[time=2922] Explaining life.
[time=2924] Because we've never developed our mind to accept anything more than the obvious.
[time=2928] And we really prefer to let somebody else do the thinking and that's when we're at our most dangerous point.
[time=2933] Let me just repeat these.
[time=2935] Five purposes that God has for us in this book of wisdom.
[time=2939] The first is to give direction to our life so that you'll apply your life and you'll know where to apply it.
[time=2944] The second is that it might give discernment to our minds.
[time=2949] So that we'll sharpen our focus and separate between the issues and see beyond face value.
[time=2955] Thirdly, to give discipline to our steps.
[time=2958] I need it most right there.
[time=2960] Fourth, to give discernment to our choices, we're going to be making them constantly.
[time=2965] And then finally, the purpose of wisdom here is to develop our minds to grow in truth and knowledge.
[time=2973] But I got some bad news for you.
[time=2978] God's wisdom is sitting here on the pages, but it's not just sitting there on a silver platter.
[time=2986] Let's look beyond the purposes of wisdom and let me ask you now to think with me about the pursuit of wisdom.
[time=2991] Turn one chapter back.
[time=2992] This is chapter two, the first five or six verses.
[time=2996] It says, "My son, if you accept my words and store out my commandments within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding, and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the Lord gives wisdom.
[time=3023] And from his mouth come knowledge and understanding." We notice the little word two or four in the first few verses.
[time=3032] Again, there's a word that's critical and it's repeated in these verses.
[time=3037] Look at verse two, "My son, if you accept my words,
[time=3044] verse three, and if you call out for insight, and verse four, and if you look for it, then verse five, then, if, if, if, then."
[time=3060] God is not saying, "You want wisdom?"
[time=3067] Spam, I'll zap you, there it is.
[time=3070] All of a sudden you've got all the smarts you've ever wanted.
[time=3073] Nope, God says that wisdom is granted conditionally.
[time=3078] And here are the three conditions.
[time=3082] First of all, you must study diligently.
[time=3084] That's verses one and two.
[time=3086] "My son, if you accept my words," that's the first lesson you're gonna have to learn if you're ever gonna be a student.
[time=3092] You've gotta accept the word of God.
[time=3094] Too often we only want to accept it conditionally, the conditions if I like it.
[time=3100] If I don't like it, I push it aside.
[time=3102] My son, if you will accept my words, then store them up, not only accept them, say, "All right, that's fine," but keep it.
[time=3110] Store it up, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding.
[time=3117] The first condition of getting the wisdom that God has for us is that we study diligently.
[time=3123] Second thing is that we search desperately.
[time=3128] Verse three, and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, we talked about the analogy of that mother who's lost the son.
[time=3137] Now picture the son who realized he's lost his mother.
[time=3141] He's got no sense of social consciousness.
[time=3144] He knows two things.
[time=3145] One, he's lost and two, he wants his mother.
[time=3148] And he will pour out the tears and cry.
[time=3151] He will cry so loud and so obviously that when you see him in the mall, you don't need to ask what's wrong.
[time=3156] You instantly know this little one's lost.
[time=3160] The caring one can simply just bend down and say, "Have you lost your mom and dad?
[time=3165] "I'll help you find him." Their cry is so obvious.
[time=3171] Their search is so desperate that it's unmistakable.
[time=3177] God said, "If you want the wisdom here, "you're going to have to search as desperately "as a lost child searches for his misplaced mommy."
[time=3189] And the third if is verse four.
[time=3191] "If you look for it as for silver, "and search for it as hidden treasure." I am not a prospector and don't even think I'd like to try it.
[time=3201] But having watched enough old Westerns to picture the prospector in my mind, I've never seen one set out with a whisk broom.
[time=3208] Prospecting is not taking a little whisk broom and dusting off the rocks and saying, "Oh, silver, look over here, some diamonds." Let's turn over this next leaf and see if there isn't a ruby under there.
[time=3220] No, mining is tough work and it's only for those who are willing to scratch deep.
[time=3226] If you want the treasures of God's word, you have to be willing to scratch deep.
[time=3234] Not just scratch the surface, but to dig deeply into God's word.
[time=3239] You see, the wisdom that God has, he's got it for a purpose in our life, but it only comes to those who are willing to study diligently, to search desperately, to scratch deep.
[time=3252] Then, and here's the good news, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.
[time=3260] For the Lord gives wisdom and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
[time=3264] You want to have wisdom, then what you've got to do is bring yourself into a right relationship with God and that can only be done by accepting his son Christ unconditionally as your savior.
[time=3276] And if you want knowledge to add to that wisdom, then it comes from the mouth of God.
[time=3280] You've got to live in his words to the point that his word lives in you.
[time=3284] Then you'll have wisdom and knowledge.
[time=3287] It's a pursuit.
[time=3288] It's learned in the laboratory of life.
[time=3292] And many of you are already turning it off because you're saying, man, I don't want to hear that.
[time=3297] I like 10 easy steps to financial freedom.
[time=3300] Five minutes a day keeps the devil away, but it's worth it.
[time=3307] 'Cause fine, let me tell you about the preciousness of wisdom.
[time=3310] One more chapter over, chapter three, verse 13 says, blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding.
[time=3318] For she is more profitable than silver and her yields, that's for you investment managers, her yields better returns than gold.
[time=3328] She is more precious than rubies.
[time=3331] Nothing you desire can compare with her.
[time=3336] Wisdom is precious.
[time=3337] And take this from a man who knows.
[time=3339] Solomon had gold and silver and rubies and wisdom, like nobody else in the world of his day.
[time=3345] And when he took an inventory of assets and he took all those things and we put those on one ledger sheet and he put this on the other.
[time=3353] He said this is more valuable and more precious than that.
[time=3359] There's a story told about Henry Ford.
[time=3363] His nephew got married and the nephew was looking forward to quite a wedding gift from Uncle Henry.
[time=3369] The wedding came and so did the gift.
[time=3371] It was a Bible much like this one.
[time=3373] With artificial gratitude, the nephew and the new niece-in-law said, well, Uncle Henry, thank you.
[time=3379] Just what we had hoped we would get from you.
[time=3382] They took the book home and shelved it.
[time=3385] Till a year later when Uncle Henry came by and asked about it, have you read the Bible I gave you?
[time=3389] Oh yes, yeah, we really appreciate that Bible.
[time=3393] Uncle Henry said, could I see it?
[time=3395] Glances went back and forth as neither was certain where to retrieve the well-treasured book that Uncle Henry had given.
[time=3403] But after a moment of searching, the Bible was retrieved and presented back to Uncle Henry for his examination.
[time=3409] Uncle Henry opened it up to a particular place and pulled out from its pages a check that he had inserted a year before for several thousand dollars.
[time=3419] And he destroyed the check in front of them.
[time=3423] Returned the book and sit here.
[time=3425] The greatest riches are still there.
[time=3434] I wish for every one of us long life,
[time=3440] good health, financial prosperity.
[time=3444] But no more of it than we can handle with humility and discretion.
[time=3449] But I wish more for every one of us, a personal relationship with Jesus Christ so that we can begin the adventure of knowing his wisdom.
[time=3459] Come.
