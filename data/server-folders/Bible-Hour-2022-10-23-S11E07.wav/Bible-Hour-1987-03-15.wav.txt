[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] There is a preacher of the Old School, yet he preaches as boldly as ever.
[time=102] He's not popular, although the whole world is his parish.
[time=106] Without a doubt, D. L. Moody is one of the greatest evangelists of all times.
[time=113] Oh, to be sure, he was a bit abrasive.
[time=115] He weighed somewhere close to 300 pounds, spoke a crude form of the King's English and was famous for his direct speaking about the Lord Jesus.
[time=126] But he was a great evangelist.
[time=129] After one of his meetings, a lady came up to him, a little bit disturbed and said, "Mr. Moody, I really don't like the way you share your faith in the Lord Jesus."
[time=140] And Moody said to her, "Why, ma'am, are you a believer in the Lord Jesus?"
[time=146] And she said, "Well, to be sure, I am." He said, "Well, let me ask you this.
[time=151] How do you share your faith?" Lady was a bit taken back and stuttered and finally said, "I don't."
[time=162] And Moody replied, "Well, madam, I like the way I'm doing it, better than the way you're
[time=169] not doing it."
[time=178] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on The Bible Hour.
[time=187] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=189] Today, Rick is continuing his series on the missionary with a message entitled A Missionary is an evangelist.
[time=197] Sharing our faith in Christ is not always easy.
[time=201] Sometimes we fear rejection.
[time=202] Other times we fear being misunderstood.
[time=205] None of us want to be viewed as a pushy salesman or as an overbearing scalp hunter.
[time=211] Too often we do nothing, nothing at all.
[time=214] But Christ commands each of us to spread the good news.
[time=218] Don't forget that it is the Good News.
[time=221] Please have your Bible ready as we study biblical principles for sharing the good news.
[time=227] The sanctuary choir will be singing a song entitled "People Need the Lord" taken from their recent album.
[time=235] We will also be hearing from Rejoice and Bob Vanetta.
[time=242] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=250] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=256] Now here's Rick.
[time=257] So joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=260] We trust that this hour of worship will be that which strengthens our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and challenges each of us who know Christ to serve Him fully.
[time=270] We're delighted that you've come that we can share this opportunity together.
[time=275] There are a number of people that each of us meet during a week.
[time=280] A man who closes his ledger book in his office sees the prophet for the year but also sees
[time=288] his life as empty and says, "So what?" He needs the Lord.
[time=296] An older woman who now lives in the retirement, assisted living home, oh she's able to get
[time=302] around but not as much as she used to.
[time=306] Life seems boring, the future seems bleak.
[time=310] She often wonders about eternity.
[time=314] She needs the Lord.
[time=315] There's a lady who lives in the house just like mine or perhaps just like yours in suburbia.
[time=323] Children keep her busy all day, she doesn't have time to think.
[time=327] She wonders what's life really all about.
[time=330] She feels so alone.
[time=332] She needs the Lord.
[time=334] People need the Lord.
[time=353] Every day they pass me by, I can see it in their eyes.
[time=378] Empty people feel with care, and in through the strength.
[time=392] And in the heart of the Lord, they feel with care.
[time=424] They feel with care, they feel with care, they feel with care.
[time=424] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 160 seconds] They feel with care, they feel with care, they feel with care....
[time=614] Sometimes the profoundness of an anthem like that and the words and the responsibility
[time=624] that we have, knowing that there are people all around us that need the Lord, and have asked us the question, "What are we doing?" Even as we leave that and sing it together, there's that dilemma that we have of accepting the fact that we are responsible to tell others about Jesus Christ.
[time=644] Christ does receive sinful men, that's the title of our next song, "545."
[time=674] Christ is living in the Holy Spirit, and that we are all in.
[time=698] Christ is living in the Holy Spirit, and that we are all in, that we are all in, that we
[time=713] are all in, that we are all in, that we are all in, that we are all in, that we are all
[time=713] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 1271 seconds] are all in, that we are all in, that we are all in, that we are all in, that we are all...
[time=2010] that means that less than 75 of the 1500 people here, in your whole lifetime will ever tell
[time=2018] anybody else about Christ, that means 1,425 of us who know Christ is Savior will never
[time=2025] share that with another person, and yet it is God's plan of salvation, it is forgiveness
[time=2033] of sin, it is home and heaven, it is an unlimited supply and it is free and 1,425 of us will
[time=2039] keep it to ourselves, wow.
[time=2044] Why is that?
[time=2045] Well I think there are three basic reasons why most of us don't share Christ, the first one is the fear of rejection, let's admit it we are all human and all of us hate to be rejected, men you remember back to somewhere around 15, 16, 17 years old, the first time
[time=2060] you asked to grow out for a date, oh man, I would have rather tried to swim across the
[time=2066] Atlantic Ocean is that first phone call, do you men remember that?
[time=2070] First of all there was the problem of trying to get to the phone at a time when nobody else was in the room, nobody was going to overhear this conversation, then I can remember
[time=2080] dialing a phone, hoping she would answer and yet hoping nobody would answer, I can remember
[time=2088] starting conversations and trying to keep conversations going because I was afraid to say will you
[time=2094] go to the basketball game with me, what if she said no, how would I live, how would
[time=2100] I face a high school tomorrow, what if we got out that I was shot down, oh that fear
[time=2106] of rejection runs deep, that person is on the other end of the phone and instead of
[time=2112] asking the question you keep making conversation, then somebody walks in the room and you drag the phone, you know, in the next room you shut the door, you crawl under the pill and you're still there, yeah I'm still there, you know, you don't want anybody to hear this, it's traumatic, some of our high school guys are taking notes, then finally you just can't
[time=2133] come out and ask it so you start to probe a little bit, do you want anything Friday night,
[time=2139] no, no, really, you're not doing anything Friday night, you like basketball, yeah, you
[time=2146] like our team, yeah, so finally you get up the curtain you say them, well what I wanted to know was about the basketball game, who do you think will win, finally you get it out,
[time=2161] will you go to the basketball game with me, and it wasn't as bad as you thought, really
[time=2167] bothered you that that was her night to wash her hair but it wasn't as bad as you thought, remember why we don't make those fear of rejection, all of us are afraid that if I tell somebody
[time=2179] else about the Lord that they might reject me, what we're saying is I like me better and
[time=2185] I like them, second reason why we often don't share the Lord is a fear of failure, I mean
[time=2195] what if I start to tell somebody about the Lord, what if I say to them in an appropriate way why something exciting has happened in my life can I tell you about it and they say yes and I said well a few years ago I came to know Christ personally and it's made such
[time=2209] a difference in my life, what if in that conversation they say you know I've always wondered how many angels can dance on the head of a pin at the same time and I wouldn't know and I'd
[time=2220] fail, another reason why we often don't share Christ is a fear of being misunderstood, all
[time=2230] of us have been the victim of the overly aggressive sales person, the person who doesn't pick
[time=2237] up nonverbal signals, you know doors slammed in their face, they don't catch the drift, they ring the bell again, somebody who is relentless and we're afraid that we'll be viewed like
[time=2250] that, too pushy, too aggressive, all of those are real reasons but let me ask you to do
[time=2260] this, measure on one end of the scale the fear of being rejected, then lay next to that
[time=2269] the fear of being misunderstood, then lay next to that the fear of failure, you've got that
[time=2276] all on one side, I'll put on the other side of the scale, the people who you love and
[time=2282] know who don't know Christ and what eternity holds for them, which to you is more significant,
[time=2291] your comfort or their eternity, that's really the issue, I think the book of Proverbs gives
[time=2298] us three good words to remember about sharing our faith in Christ, the first is a word about
[time=2306] being wise, Proverbs 11 verse 30, if you have your Bible, book of Proverbs is found just
[time=2312] about in the middle, unless you've got pages and pages of maps and stuff in the back, but just about in the middle, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, that's the neighborhood we're in, chapter 11
[time=2324] verse 30, reads like this, the fruit of righteousness is a tree of life and he who wins souls is
[time=2337] wise, the Bible says that if a person is really wise, they'll win people to Christ, now what's
[time=2348] so wise about winning people to Christ, let me just suggest these five reasons very quickly and then we're going to move on. First of all, it's wise to share the gospel of Christ with other people for this reason, people are living spirits that will live on beyond death, when
[time=2369] we go to that funeral home and from there on that slow drive to the cemetery, we're only
[time=2375] placing a body in the ground, the person is still as much alive as they ever were and their soul, their spirit lives on an eternity and that spirit can be eternally lost. A wise
[time=2388] person lives beyond their comfort of today and thinks about eternity and the high stakes
[time=2394] that are involved here. So a wise person tries to win others to Christ. A second reason
[time=2403] why it's wise to win people to Christ is because they're coming to eternal life and forgiveness
[time=2410] is so important that Christ had all died for their sins. You talk about a high price value,
[time=2420] what could be more valuable than the life that Christ gave, his own. And so a wise person
[time=2427] says, if it's important enough for Christ to give up his life to die, it's important
[time=2433] enough for me to give up my life to live so that other people can know him.
[time=2440] A third reason why it's wise to win people to Christ is that it's God's will for them
[time=2446] to come to Christ. In Peter it says, it is not God's will that any should perish. If
[time=2453] anyone ever dies and perishes spends eternity in hell, it will not be because that was God's
[time=2460] desire. It's God's desire for every person to come to Christ and you're simply teaming
[time=2467] up with the God of eternity when you share it with somebody else. A fourth reason is
[time=2473] this, it's God's will, his desire for them to come to Christ by you and me sharing the
[time=2482] Lord with him. I've shared this with you before but allow me a second pass. It's not
[time=2489] a true story, it's totally fictitious but excellent in its power. The story is told
[time=2496] that after the Lord Jesus died on the cross and ascended to heaven, he was greeted by the angels and they were all impressed with his love for humanity. And Michael said to
[time=2506] the Lord, Lord we saw how you gave up your life and how you have paid for the sins of the world, Lord it is a marvelous plan. But this question Lord, how will everybody know
[time=2520] of your love and of your death? And Jesus said to the angel, well I have 11 men that
[time=2527] I called disciples and I've asked them to tell everybody. The angel said, well what
[time=2536] about the next generations and the whole world? Lord said, well those 11, I've asked them
[time=2542] to tell everybody and to tell the people they tell to tell others and do so pass it on from
[time=2549] every corner of the world around the world and from this generation to all future generations.
[time=2554] My plan is for them to tell and those that are told to tell others. The angel said, well
[time=2562] Lord what if the 11 don't do that or what if the people they tell are the third or fourth
[time=2568] generation, what if somewhere along the way the people don't tell other people, what's your plan? And the Lord said, I have no other plan. The story is totally fictitious, the
[time=2588] point is not. God has no other plan for people to come to Christ but for you and for me to
[time=2599] tell them. God has no other plan. There's a fifth reason why it's wise to tell other
[time=2608] people about Christ because when you do you'll find the greatest joy in life. If you're
[time=2614] not telling people about Christ you're missing out. And I'm not saying that because it's
[time=2620] my job to say it, I believe that as deeply as I believe anything in my life. I'd like
[time=2627] to tell you about other lives but I don't know them as well as I know mine so I'm going to tell you something out of my own life. I was a high school swimmer, not all that good
[time=2637] but good enough to be on a team and I enjoyed it. Not only did I enjoy it, I lived for it.
[time=2643] I mean you have to be a little bit off, I understand that to start every morning at 6 a.m. soaking your head in ice water but that's what we did. It was a great life. And nothing was
[time=2654] more important or more fulfilling to me than swimming on a good swim team and occasionally winning a race. That was life. One afternoon, an afternoon practice, I'd only been a believer
[time=2666] a few months. I sensed that there was something exciting about knowing the Lord. We were swimming
[time=2674] quarter miles. You swam a quarter mile every six minutes so if you got done in four minutes you had two minutes rest. If you got done in five minutes like I did, you got a minute's rest. Several guys in the lane you go down one side and back the other and at the end of the pool you hang on for a minute and talk and try to catch your breath hoping that the coach forgets to come out and blow the whistle to start the next quarter mile. I'm hanging on the wall with about a minute and 15 seconds of rest. Jeff stops, he's got about a minute and 10 seconds and we start to talk and he says, Dale says you're going to church. I
[time=2709] said yeah, I didn't know I was supposed to be embarrassed. I said it's really neat. He said it is. And we just talked for a few moments and the whistle blew. Off we went on another
[time=2720] quarter mile swim. Five minutes later we stopped and we hang on the wall and he asked another question. Whistle blows and we take off on another quarter mile and it was during the fourth quarter mile that it dawned on me. I liked talking to Jeff more than I liked swimming
[time=2738] and I realized there's not anything more thrilling in life than to be a part of God's process
[time=2744] in seeing someone else come to Christ. It is a joy. That's what Proverbs 11, 30 says.
[time=2752] The fruit of righteousness is a tree of life. That phrase tree of life is a Hebrew expression
[time=2758] for inner joy, satisfaction and fulfillment. Psalm 1, 2, he shall be like a tree of life
[time=2765] planted by rivers of water that bring fruit fruit in its season and its leaf also shall
[time=2771] not wither. It's just saying life booms from inside out. It's a joy to work with people
[time=2777] coming to Christ. And you know what? 1425 of you will never know that joy. How unwise.
[time=2791] We live in the world where people are running around desperately saying life is empty. It's
[time=2797] a bore. It's a rip off. And you and I have the privilege of saying oh man you're missing
[time=2805] it. Christ can give you a purpose in life and the greatest purpose in my life is to tell
[time=2811] you about it. It's a tree of life. Sometimes you'll see our high school students when
[time=2818] they come back from operation outreach or our summer mission students when they come back or somebody who's been out on a Wednesday night sharing their faith in Christ or just the neighbors told someone about the Lord and you see the joy and you know what it can be yours and it's free. You just have to share it. A word about being wise is this wise people
[time=2839] try to win others to Christ. Now the word win there sometimes conjures up competitive
[time=2846] images, me against you, one on one, taking it to the hoop. Well first of all five eight
[time=2853] you don't take it to the hoop. You don't even get involved in the game. This is not a competitive
[time=2859] word. We live in a very hostile competitive society but this word win actually means let
[time=2867] me change a verse on you. Turn with me if you will to Proverbs 25 verse 15 and that will
[time=2873] explain this word win. It's our second thing that Proverbs teaches us about sharing. Our
[time=2880] faith not only a word about being wise but secondly here it is a word about being winsome.
[time=2889] It says through patience a ruler can be persuaded in this phrase and a gentle tongue can break
[time=2896] a bone. That word win actually means to draw somebody by taking them by the hand and drawing
[time=2905] them to yourself and embracing them. It's a good courtship word, trying to win and to
[time=2911] woo somebody that you love to your side. It's not talking about competition more talking
[time=2918] about courtship and that's the second dimension that Proverbs gives us about sharing our faith
[time=2924] is we have to do it winsomely. It's good to do what we did last week and that's to equate serving Christ of being a soldier and the New Testament is full of that imagery. Timothy
[time=2935] be the all a good soldier but there's something unique about the Christian soldier. Stick your
[time=2942] bulletin here in Proverbs and turn to the New Testament the book of 1 Timothy to begin with in chapter 6. In a regular war the idea is to either kill or capture the enemy. In
[time=2959] the spiritual war the idea is not to kill them or to capture them the idea is to release
[time=2965] them and to win them and so the whole strategy is different. In 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse
[time=2973] 11 it says but you oh man of God flee from all this pursue six things righteousness,
[time=2979] godliness, faith, love, endurance and the sixth word in my translation is gentleness from
[time=2988] the next phrase fight the good fight. Isn't that strange? It says be gentle and fight.
[time=2995] The image doesn't fit. Can you picture this drill sergeant saying now I'm in we're going up the front lines right now and I want you to go out there face that in me eyeball eyeball and I want you to give him a big hug. First of all I'm not going to join that army. You
[time=3011] won't make it eyeball. The image doesn't fit. Can you picture for those of you who like
[time=3017] boxing? Angelo Dundee he's in the corner with Mohammed Ali. He's rubbing the champ's shoulders
[time=3023] down and he says now smoking Joe's over there in that corner and I want you to go out there and I want you to keep that left up but don't hit him. I want you to be gentle. I want you
[time=3036] to be winsome. I want you to smile a lot. It isn't what they say. This is a strange
[time=3043] fight we're in. This is a unique war and we never win it by being hostile. We never win
[time=3050] it by being militant. We only win it by being gentle. It never pays to argue. Someone put
[time=3057] it this way. A man persuaded against his will is of his own opinion still. It never pays
[time=3067] to argue with somebody. It never pays to try to win the debate because you will always
[time=3074] lose the person. Proverbs 25, 15 says that a gentle word can break a bond. Somebody's
[time=3084] got a hard heart and you attack that hard heart. You know what they're going to do?
[time=3089] They're going to fortify the gates. They're going to bar the door and brick up the windows.
[time=3096] You know what? A soft word, gentle spirit can open some tough doors. It can break a bone.
[time=3107] It can break a hard heart. Proverbs 15, 1, compliments the theme beautifully. It says
[time=3113] a soft answer turns away wrath, grievous words stir up anger. It never pays to debate. No
[time=3121] one is ever drug into the kingdom of God against their will. So there's no purpose in us trying
[time=3127] to do it. Being winsome is the key to being a witness. Being one of those people who are
[time=3136] soft, yet firm, those people who are huggable, embraceable, who just care. That's all they
[time=3150] just care. The proverbs have a third word for us. A word about being wise, a word about
[time=3159] being winsome and then in chapter 24, a severe word, a word about being warned. You see,
[time=3171] the Bible puts it squarely on our shoulders. It is our responsibility to bring other people
[time=3179] to Christ. It's our job. God's got no other plan. It's for you to do. It's for me to do.
[time=3186] Yet as human beings, we have an amazing ability to dodge responsibility. We have three children
[time=3193] and occasionally our family room qualifies for disaster relief funds. They're toys upon
[time=3199] toys upon toys. They play with one, get out another, play with a third and on it goes in with three kids. It goes exponentially. Occasionally, I say kids, time out here, time
[time=3211] to clean up the floor, put all the toys away. Occasionally, no more than two or three times the half hour. As soon as I suggest that it's time to pick up the toys, all of them plead
[time=3223] innocence. I didn't play with any of these. Somebody else got them out. These aren't mine.
[time=3229] I have to walk back into the kitchen and say, Kathy, have you been playing with the Legos and Barbie again? None of them will ever claim, yep, that's my job. Everyone of them claims
[time=3240] innocence. Or you say to the children, did you know that when you ride your bike and
[time=3249] it's raining out, you're supposed to bring it inside? I didn't know that. Let's do a
[time=3257] little educational process. From now on, when you're outside riding your bike, it's raining out, you come in, the bike comes in. Got it? Got it. Next day, it rains, bikes out. Did you remember supposed to bring your bike? I didn't know that. Isn't it amazing? You
[time=3275] know what we do that as adults? Our ability as adults to admit that it's my responsibility.
[time=3281] I blew it. It's my job. We can't handle that any better than my kids can. These are true
[time=3287] stories. You're going to believe these are made up, but these were actually in print.
[time=3291] These are claims. People turned into their insurance company, and this is the description
[time=3297] of how the accident occurred. First one says, I turned the corner and a fire hydrant struck
[time=3304] me on the side of a car. Second one said, I dodged to the right and then to the left.
[time=3313] I made several attempts to get out of its way, and the parked car hit me. This is true, someone
[time=3322] said. An invisible car appeared out of nowhere. With an invisible driver who struck my car
[time=3329] and then vanished. This fourth one, they may have paid the claim. One simple explanation
[time=3336] it said, my mother-in-law was in the back seat. It's tough for us to say, I did it. It's my
[time=3349] fault. I was careless. Art, that's my job. I should have gotten it done. I should have
[time=3357] gotten it done on time. Look at Proverbs 24, verse 11. It says, rescue those being led
[time=3368] away to death. Hold back those staggering towards the slaughter. Here's the image that
[time=3374] there are people either willingly or ignorantly. They're marching into their own death. Picture
[time=3380] in our society that bridge that was struck by a ship in the Tampa Bay in a foggy night.
[time=3388] And now cars are driving off the damaged bridge into the ocean. And a man gets his car stopped and he begins to walk back. And he's frantically telling people, stop, stop the bridges out.
[time=3404] Could you imagine a man walking back, knowing the bridges out, watching car after car just
[time=3410] drive off the edge? No. None of us would do that. Here the Bible saying, rescue them.
[time=3420] They're perishing. Rescue them. They're walking into death, eternally. Hold them back. Notice
[time=3429] what the Lord says in verse 12. If you say, well, I didn't know, that's what it says.
[time=3436] I didn't know, but we didn't know this, Lord. We didn't know a thing about it. Here's what
[time=3442] the Lord says. Doesn't he who weighs the heart perceive it, does not he who guards your life
[time=3451] know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? God says two things. First
[time=3460] of all, it's your job to know it. And secondly, you already know it. God will not take excuses.
[time=3467] He will not take lame explanations as I was afraid they would reject me or I didn't want
[time=3473] to be misunderstood. God said, I told you, rescue them. Hold them back. It's our responsibility
[time=3487] to share Christ. We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of Rejoice and soloist
[time=3506] Bob Vanett. Our pastor talked on a dynamic theme of being an evangelist and our choir sang
[time=3512] a song that was entitled, People Need the Lord. If as a result of today's program, you've
[time=3518] made a decision concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ. Just before we pray, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you. Will you bow your heads and pray this prayer with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the
