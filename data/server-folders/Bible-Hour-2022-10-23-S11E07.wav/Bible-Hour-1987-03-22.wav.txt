[time=148] - It is a joy on this first Sunday of spring to welcome you.

[time=819] Thank you for joining us again today for the Bible Hour.
[time=826] As you can tell, I have a cold, but I have the good fortune that we're having an exciting guest speaker here today.
[time=832] So like you, I have the opportunity of enjoying the message from our speaker, Norm Nicholas.
[time=838] Rick, Norm has been around for many years in the missionary circles and is an outstanding speaker.
[time=843] And I haven't seen him for several years, but I'm looking forward to his message today.
[time=847] And then this evening, we have the privilege of having the Taylor University symphonic band with us.
[time=852] That's a 45-member band directed by Albert Harrison.
[time=856] And Taylor is just down the road a little ways.
[time=858] We have some of our young people that go there.
[time=860] They're going to be with us tonight in our 545 hour.
[time=863] We've moved the service just 15 minutes to the 545 time slot.
[time=868] So I hope that you can come and be with us for the concert.
[time=871] And then Norm Nicholas will be speaking to us again tonight.
[time=875] I'm looking forward to that, and I encourage you to come if you can.
[time=879] We're fast approaching a holiday season that probably is the most significant holiday for Christians.
[time=885] Not just in terms of what we celebrate, but certainly the most significant in its meaning.
[time=891] Good Friday when we remember the death of the Lord Jesus, and then Easter Sunday morning when we remember that he arose again.
[time=899] We have two special services.
[time=901] The first one is at the Grand Wayne on Good Friday over the lunch hour.
[time=906] We're going down there so that many of you who are working throughout the community can merge on this one central location.
[time=913] The service will be at 1215 to 1245 so that you can come during your lunch hour if you're working that day.
[time=920] We'll be having an exciting drama, music, and a message untitled.
[time=925] Why do they call it Good Friday?
[time=927] There'll be plenty of parking at the Civic Garage and throughout the area.
[time=931] We certainly hope that you'll come.
[time=934] Rick Christmas, I'm sorry, Easter is an exciting time to talk about the triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=940] And there are some wonderful songs that speak of that.
[time=943] And for me, it's exciting to direct the choir and that kind of music.
[time=947] We'll be having our Easter musical on Easter evening.
[time=951] That's April 19th at 6 p.m.
[time=953] We encourage any of you that are available and have the time and can come to come with us and join in a great musical festival as we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Sunday evening April 19th at 6 o'clock here in the Black Hawk Convocation Center.
[time=969] I'm looking forward to that.
[time=971] Just before Jesus' death and his resurrection, he made a promise.
[time=975] He said, "Peace, I leave with you.
[time=978] Not peace that the world gives.
[time=980] It won't fade.
[time=981] It won't vanish.
[time=983] A peace that will last." We have a booklet entitled "Peace in spite of panic." Every one of us have situations in our life which cause us great anxiety, fear, prompt an instant response of panic.
[time=998] But God says, "I've got a stable life as it enfours that come into your life that will sustain you in spite of the circumstances.
[time=1007] Peace in spite of panic is an exciting book by Charles Windall that we're offering this month if you'll simply write and ask for.
[time=1016] It's a way of helping you to grow in your spiritual life and to gain strength during those crises moments.
[time=1022] If you'd like a copy, simply write to us today.
[time=1025] This is a great booklet of encouragement, and if you'd like to receive it, write to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1036] The address once again is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1045] Thank you for joining us again today.
[time=1047] And we trust that this message from Norm Nicholas will strengthen your faith and challenge you in a great way
[time=1054] so that at the end of the hour, you'll have a new sense of spiritual power in your life.
[time=1059] We deeply appreciate those of you who've watched, and those of you who write in with words of encouragement are perhaps suggestions. We appreciate those just as much.
[time=1068] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, we hope that you'll stay with us and you'll find the ministry of music as encouraging as the first part of this service.
[time=1084] [MUSIC]

[time=1338] Cast all your cares on him, for he cares for you.
[time=1348] He is our peace.
[time=1373] Thank you, Marilyn and Marsha.
[time=1376] Let us pray together.
[time=1378] God, you have promised to us a peace.
[time=1382] Jesus would offer us a peace that is incomparable.
[time=1387] Father, today it is our heart's desire to know that peace.
[time=1392] We would pray today for those who carry great burdens that you would be to them, that gift of peace.
[time=1400] We pray for those who are facing a critical crossroads in their life.
[time=1405] They have decisions to make that are consequential, life-altering.
[time=1411] We pray that you would give them a gift of peace, a resignation in the spite of panic that they could trust you today.
[time=1421] God, we ask you to give peace to those who are lonely today, particularly the elderly who feel abandoned, exiled, discarded.
[time=1433] Father, we pray that you would give peace today to those who are struggling in their spiritual life, uncertain as to where they stand with you.
[time=1445] Father, we pray that your spirit would cause them to see the complete forgiveness in new life that they can have in Christ, that they might have peace from God.
[time=1456] Father, today we pray for those whose health is so volatile, some are battling cancer, others a serious heart condition.
[time=1466] One friend, a need very great but so sensitive that you can't even have it mentioned.
[time=1473] God, we ask you to give peace to those.
[time=1477] We ask you to give peace today to parents, whose hearts are broken because of the excess of the rebellion of their children.
[time=1487] We ask you to give peace.
[time=1491] We ask you to give peace to young men and women who are striving to follow you, but their parents are not.
[time=1500] We ask you to give peace. Father, we today more than anything else ask you to give us a lack of peace as we look at a world who so desperately needs Christ.
[time=1512] God don't allow peace to turn into complacency than even worse complacency to contempt.
[time=1520] God give us a holy dissatisfaction until we reach out with long arms of love and embrace a world that so desperately needs Christ.
[time=1531] We pray that you would make of each of us ambassadors to this community, that you would raise up from this church, those who would go out as ambassadors to new lands, to kofu Japan, to Manila.
[time=1544] God keep our eyes on the cross, quiet us, convict us as we survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of glory died.
[time=1574] God keep our eyes on the cross.
[time=1722] Indiana is a great basketball state so I'm sure you can understand and relate to the illustration I'm going to give.
[time=1730] My son Timothy, he's just entered into seventh grade and he likes basketball.
[time=1736] Now we were from Brazil and I was hoping he was going to pursue a course in soccer but he has developed a real passion for basketball.
[time=1743] And recently we had the opportunity to go over to the Cherry Hill Mall and meet in person Charles Barkley.
[time=1750] Charles Barkley plays for the 76ers and he's quite a fella and my son was all excited about seeing Charles Barkley in person.
[time=1758] So he took his nice new basketball and it was going to be autographed by Charles Barkley.
[time=1763] So he weighed in line about an hour and a half and finally we got up to the place where we could shake hands and Tim reaches out and shakes hands with the famous Charles Barkley.
[time=1774] And Charles takes that ball and his hands and he signs it and he was so excited as we walked away and he says, "Dad, you think I'll ever be as tall as Charles Barkley and be able to play like him?"
[time=1785] Well I thought of the size of my dad and I'm about four inches taller than my dad and I'm just pushing five foot nine so I says to Tim.
[time=1792] I'm really not sure that you're ever going to be quite as tall as Charles Barkley.
[time=1796] Why don't you try and be as tall as a spider web?
[time=1800] Now if you're familiar with basketball he's a fella just about my size or a little shorter and he is quite adept at playing professional basketball.
[time=1809] So my son now in seventh grade he made the junior varsity team.
[time=1812] He scored six points in one of his games as high score and he's so excited about becoming maybe.
[time=1819] I don't know a young boy like that, a very impression. Maybe he likes to become a professional basketball player.
[time=1825] And he has some skills but I don't know if he's ever going to reach those heights of skills and development.
[time=1833] But that relates to our theme of our missionary conference for today.
[time=1837] We've been talking during the month about missions and a missionary is one who has a vision.
[time=1842] He's a visionary. He's able to see what God can do around the world.
[time=1845] A missionary is also an evangelist, one who shares the good news of the gospel.
[time=1850] And a missionary is also a soldier. He's involved in fighting the evil forces of this world
[time=1857] and bringing into existence churches that will oppose the devil and endeavor to establish the peace and the reign of Jesus Christ.
[time=1866] And now we're talking about our theme today.
[time=1869] Missionary is you. And you might say, "Well, Brother Norm, I could never be a professional missionary.
[time=1876] And my stage in life or my training or the ability that God has given me, I'll never be a professional missionary."
[time=1882] So how did that then relate to me? Well, very, very applicable.
[time=1889] Because although not everyone is going to be a professional missionary, each one of us should be involved in doing missionary activity.
[time=1898] There are activities that should be in your life and my life as a Christian.
[time=1903] Now, Jesus Christ said to the Apostle Paul, "I have appeared unto you to make you a witness."
[time=1911] Now, that's really when we're talking about the theme. A missionary is you.
[time=1915] We're talking about you as a witness, as a person who knows Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, who had the opportunity to have a changed life, and now you want to share and communicate to other individuals
[time=1927] what God has done in your life. You are a witness.
[time=1931] And the Bible says that Jesus said to Paul, "I have appeared to you to make you a witness.
[time=1936] I'm going to take you and I'm going to mold you and develop you so that you will have the ability to share your faith."
[time=1943] And Paul did that for many years in a non-professional way.
[time=1947] He was not a missionary, but he was a missionary in training.
[time=1951] And then fighting the time came when his skills and development and his spiritual maturity had reached a point
[time=1957] where the Holy Spirit didn't separate me.
[time=1960] Paul, for the work we're on to have called him.
[time=1963] So as we talk about missionary service, as it relates to you this morning, and as it relates to me,
[time=1969] we're talking about being a missionary, being a witness, sharing your faith.
[time=1974] And those convictions that were in the life of the Apostle Paul, that Jesus inculcated and developed
[time=1980] and brought to full fruition in his life, can be and should be in our life.
[time=1985] And I'd like to look at Romans chapter 1, where we see those convictions that Jesus Christ, when he appeared to Paul,
[time=1991] says, "I am going to make you to become a faithful and a fervent and a fruitful witness."
[time=1997] And so in Romans chapter 1, we have the Apostle Paul talking to us, sharing with us those convictions
[time=2004] that worked in his life and that were developed to the point that he could be a very useful tool in the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2014] And in Romans chapter 1 verse 16, we see that first conviction that permeated his life and enabled him to be a very useful witness.
[time=2021] He says there in verse 16, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation, for everyone who believed,
[time=2029] for the Jew first and also for the Greek, for in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith as it is written,
[time=2036] that just shall live by faith." Now the first conviction that Jesus developed in the life of the Apostle Paul was the desire to know the scriptures
[time=2048] and to live in such a way that he would never be ashamed of it.
[time=2051] He says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel." Now the gospel is good news. The gospel is that exciting, interesting, life-changing message that Jesus Christ has come down
[time=2065] and has died on the cross and has been risen from the dead and now he offers new life in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2072] That is the message of the gospel. The gospel is good news and it's wonderful to hear good news.
[time=2078] I've been in Fort Wayne a number of times when I've had some very good news. I was speaking a number of years over at the Emmanuel Baptist Church
[time=2085] in Fort Wayne when Dr. Tom Younger was the pastor.
[time=2088] As I was sharing the ministry of St. Paul of Brazil and challenging the church there to be involved in church planting around the world
[time=2095] and Brother Younger said to me, "Now Norm," he said, "if you challenge my church, they will respond to your challenge."
[time=2105] And if you are used to God, he said, "We are willing to borrow money so that you can take it back to Brazil and start a church."
[time=2112] And he says, "No Norm, how much money do you need?" I said, "Well, I need a little bit." He said, "No Norm, how much do you really need?" I said, "Well, I need at least $10,000." He says, "Go challenge our people to give you $10,000." So I met with the folks there at Emmanuel Baptist Church and I challenged them. I said, "This is what God has laid on my heart.
[time=2127] This is what I want to do. This is what I need to accomplish." I left the church auditorium and the church was going to have a business meeting right on the spot.
[time=2135] And I was out there wondering what was going to happen? What would be their decision? Would they or would they not?
[time=2141] And finally, Dr. Younger invited me back and says, "Norm, I have good news for you. Our church just voted to give you $10,000
[time=2149] for you to take back to St. Paul of Brazil and plant a wonderful growing church." And that's so exciting to hear that good news, that gift of money that would enable me to plant a church.
[time=2160] And that is exciting to me. Every time I drive through Fort Wayne or fly over Fort Wayne, I remember that moment.
[time=2166] As I walked in and passed with you, I said, "I have good news for you." Now, is there any way that I should ever be embarrassed about what that church did for me?
[time=2174] Is there any way I should be ashamed that Emmanuel Baptist Church voted to give me $10,000?
[time=2180] And we took it down to Brazil and we purchased a nice piece of property, and today there's a fine growing developing Baptist Church down there?
[time=2187] Not at all. Because good news is something that is exciting, something that is positive, something that is encouraging, something that is uplifting.
[time=2194] And when you're talking about the gospel, Paul says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel because it has changed my life."
[time=2200] He knew what he was, a blasphemer. I hate her of Christians. And now he met Jesus Christ face to face.
[time=2208] And he was changed into a man of God. And he said, "I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God to salvation to everyone who believes."
[time=2221] I remember as I was preaching in my first church there in St. Paul, Brazil, had the opportunity of sharing my faith.
[time=2226] And as I was talking about the necessity of giving your life to the Lord Jesus Christ and making a personal commitment to have your sins forgiven and walk with God.
[time=2236] And as I gave the invitation that Sunday evening, a young man and his wife came forward, Manuel and Zilda.
[time=2244] And I took Manuel and Zilda, took him into the side room and I counseled with them and shared with them how their life could be changed if they would open their hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2253] And they did. And that night they were born again and their lives were radically changed by the message of the gospel.
[time=2261] And he said to me at Pustor, he said, "Do you know what my wife and I were doing last night?" And I said, "No, I have no idea. Tell me about it."
[time=2269] He says, "Last night," one of the crossroads down there and he pointed out one of the crossroads.
[time=2274] He said, "Last night," he said, "my wife and I, we were down there and we were sacrificing chickens to the evil spirits."
[time=2280] He said, "We've been involved in demonic service. We've been involved in spiritism. We've been involved in Satanism."
[time=2286] And he said, "That hasn't been satisfying. And last night as we sacrificed those chickens and shed the blood there to crossroads and made our other offerings."
[time=2293] He said, "There was just an emptiness and when someone invited us to come to your church this morning, we decided."
[time=2299] And he said, "We heard the message that is exactly what we've been looking for and what I've been needing in my life."
[time=2306] And you know what Manuel is doing this morning? Manuel is preaching and pastoring that very church in which he was converted.
[time=2314] Which his life has been changed and transformed.
[time=2317] Now, can I be embarrassed about what the Lord did in the life of Manuel and Zilda?
[time=2321] Can I be ashamed because he was confronted with the claims of the gospel and Jesus changed his life and now he's pastoring and seeing that church grow and develop?
[time=2333] Paul says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel." This is the power of God to salvation to everyone that believed, whether in Brazil or the Philippine Islands or here in Fort Wayne, wherever you are.
[time=2346] If you have a spiritual need, the gospel is able to meet that need.
[time=2351] If you give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ and allow your heart to be changed and allow your sins to be forgiven.
[time=2358] And you begin to walk the Christian path you will have with the ladies who are saying, "Peace in your heart."
[time=2364] And you can never be ashamed of that because it is something that has happened to you and it works anywhere in the world.
[time=2371] And that's why Paul said, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[time=2377] For it is the power of God to salvation to everyone that believes.
[time=2382] And I trust that this morning, you who are listening to my voice and are here in the auditorium, you'll be concerned about your spiritual need.
[time=2388] You'll say, "Yes, I need that message. I need to accept Christ as my Savior. I need to have my life changed."
[time=2395] And that is the invitation that Jesus Christ gives to all of us, all over the world, that we need to allow Christ and the power of the gospel to enter and to change.
[time=2407] And once that has happened, then we should live in such a way that we will never be ashamed of the gospel.
[time=2413] Interesting in it that Paul here as a now a veteran missionary in an apostle, he would even think he would say, "I am not ashamed."
[time=2421] For him to say those words, there must have been something that had gone on his mind when he thought at one time that he would be ashamed of the gospel.
[time=2430] Have you ever felt a little bit ashamed about being a Christian?
[time=2433] You say, "Not me. Not me. I've been saved." Why would I ever be ashamed of that?
[time=2438] Well, some of you are perhaps going to go out for lunch today.
[time=2442] And you're going to have the opportunity to prove whether you're ashamed of it or not.
[time=2446] And you're going to go out to one of the restaurants here in the Fort Wayne area, and you're going to go in and you're going to give your order.
[time=2453] And then you, as a Christian, are going to do what?
[time=2456] If you're a good faithful Christian, you're going to thank God.
[time=2459] You're going to pray and ask God to bless that food and thank God for providing that food.
[time=2465] Now, have you ever been faced with that decision in public whether you're going to pray or not?
[time=2472] And many Christians, they instinctively reach for their eyebrows when they're praying in the restaurant.
[time=2477] They go like this.
[time=2479] Now, why would you do that?
[time=2482] You don't scratch your eyebrows when you pray at home.
[time=2486] Why do you do that out in public?
[time=2489] Because there's that little bit of feeling people are going to see me praying, and what are they going to think of me?
[time=2496] And some people are even afraid to scratch their eyebrows, so you know what they do?
[time=2499] They take their napkin and they drop it down on the floor.
[time=2502] And while they're down on the floor, they thank God for the food as they come back up.
[time=2505] And no one ever knew that they prayed that they were a Christian.
[time=2512] Now, I think you can identify a little bit of that, can't you?
[time=2515] All right, why is that? There's that little reluctance.
[time=2519] You know what it is? That's the work of the devil.
[time=2522] That's the work of the flesh.
[time=2524] That's what the gospel says when Paul said the preaching of the cross is foolishness to those who do not believe.
[time=2530] Those who don't know Christ is their personal Savior.
[time=2532] They think that it's foolish to believe the gospel.
[time=2535] That a man who lived and died 2,000 years ago can affect and change and alter my life and the course of my destiny.
[time=2543] That's foolishness.
[time=2545] And the world tries to make us believe that we're foolish for believing that.
[time=2549] And it's evidence in that little reluctance just to pray and to thank the living and the true God for what he has done.
[time=2557] You don't have to stand up and ask for everybody to be quiet, but you just quietly bow your head and thank God.
[time=2566] Not being ashamed at all that Jesus Christ has changed your life.
[time=2573] Now, if you're living the gospel in a way that brings embarrassment, then you've got to be embarrassed of the way you live.
[time=2579] I was out with one of my fellow missionaries in Brazil, and some interesting thing happened.
[time=2584] We went into the restaurant, and as we sat down, he noticed that there was some dirt on the plate.
[time=2590] And so he called the Garosanel over there, and he said, "This plate is dirty." And he was quite upset about that.
[time=2596] I don't like to lead off a dirty plate either, but he was quite upset.
[time=2599] And so he got another clean plate, and then we waited for the water to come.
[time=2602] There wasn't enough ice in the ice water, and that upset my missionary friend.
[time=2606] Then we got some coffee, and the coffee wasn't quite hot enough, and that upset my friend.
[time=2610] And then he ordered some nice barbecue, and he wanted it well, well done, because it was pork, and he wanted to make sure it was very well done.
[time=2617] And when it came, it was only well done.
[time=2619] And so he got upset about that, and he told the Garosan to come back and said, "Send this back, I told the chef, I want it well, well done."
[time=2625] And I was observing this.
[time=2628] And just about that time then, it came time for us to finish our meal, and so as we get up to Lee, he reached into his pocket, and pulled out a track, and put it on the table, and we walked up to pay at the cashier's office.
[time=2639] Well, I was thinking, "What am I going to do?" And so I left my briefcase under the table.
[time=2645] And as I got up to the cashier's office, I forgot my briefcase, so I walked back to pick up my briefcase, and while I was up there, you know what I did, I picked up the track, and I slipped it in my pocket.
[time=2653] You know why I did that?
[time=2655] Because I was embarrassed, I was ashamed that the way my missionary friend was living the gospel.
[time=2660] He had acted in a very uncouth way, and now he was going to give a track.
[time=2666] And I said, "That man said that he's going to think that that's what Christians are like, and if he thinks that's what Christians are like,
[time=2672] then he'll never want to become a Christian." And so I had to take the track and hide it out of embarrassment of the way my friend was living.
[time=2680] Paul says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[time=2686] And I trust that you'll live your life.
[time=2688] You've already made your decisions to accept Christ.
[time=2691] That you'll live your life in such a way that you will never bring shame and disgrace upon this church or upon the message of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2701] Paul says, "I am not ashamed." And if we're going to be a witness, if we're going to be a faithful missionary where we are, then there must be that conviction that dominates our life in such a way that we'll live pleasing to the gospel.
[time=2714] Then notice in verse 14, the second conviction is in the life of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2718] He says, "I am a debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and the unwise." And he makes an interesting statement.
[time=2724] He says, "I am a debtor." Now most of us understand what being in debt is.
[time=2731] My second son, Robert, he recently experienced that in a very unique way.
[time=2737] A few months ago, he fell in love with a fine young Christian girl at a camp.
[time=2746] Well, the only problem was that he lives in New Jersey and she lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
[time=2751] And so he wanted to continue to develop that relationship and I said, "Well, Bob, what I'll do, I'll pay for one phone call a month."
[time=2758] And I said, "Anything over there you have to pay for him." "Okay, Dad." And I noticed with quite regularly he was on the phone.
[time=2765] And I said, "Are you talking to Betsy?" And he says, "Yeah." I said, "Bob, that's a long distance phone call. You've got to be careful." He says, "Don't worry, Dad. I have everything under control." And 16-year-olds always have everything under control.
[time=2777] And so I says, "Okay." Then we got the phone bill.
[time=2783] $390 worth of debt.
[time=2786] You believe that?
[time=2787] My 16-year-old boy, $390 worth of minutes of love to Betsy.
[time=2795] But $390 in debt to Dad.
[time=2799] And I kept my word.
[time=2801] And I found the most expensive call, $40, and I deducted that, so I said, "Okay, Bob, you owe me $350."
[time=2808] Wow, has that been a source of irritation to Bob?
[time=2813] To pay that debt.
[time=2815] Last week, he paid it off.
[time=2817] Finally, it took him four months to finally get it.
[time=2819] He's learned to write a lot better now instead of a call.
[time=2823] But he's finally out of debt.
[time=2825] And that's sort of what being a debt means.
[time=2827] Paul says, "I'm a debtor to the Greeks." But you say, "Well, how does that apply to me?
[time=2833] What does that mean to Paul?" "I'm a debtor," he says, "to the Greeks." Well, Paul never borrowed money from them.
[time=2838] He never owed them anything.
[time=2840] He didn't even know many of them.
[time=2841] How could he say he has a debt to them?
[time=2844] Well, there's another way of getting in debt besides just borrowing or running up a telephone bill.
[time=2849] Recently, an individual that I knew under my responsibility, he was going to South America.
[time=2855] And I said, "All right, now I want you to take this letter that has $60 in it for my friend of mine who's graduating from the university,
[time=2861] and I want you to give this to him." And he accepted that responsibility that I gave to him.
[time=2867] Immediately, he was in debt to me to fulfill that responsibility, to take that $60 in that envelope.
[time=2873] And when he got in South Paulo, Brazil, to give it to Manuel, in Moises, so that he would be able to receive my gift for his graduation service.
[time=2883] And so when I gave him that responsibility immediately, he was in debt to me.
[time=2888] He had a responsibility to fulfill the obligation I gave to him.
[time=2892] And he also had an obligation to Moises in mind well, to give that envelope with those funds to him.
[time=2900] And so he was in debt to me to fulfill the responsibility that I gave to him.
[time=2903] He was in debt to Moises to give to him what he had to do.
[time=2908] And so that is what Paul was talking about when he says he's a debtor.
[time=2912] He says I am a debtor when he accepted Christ as his personal Savior, and Jesus Christ says I've appeared to you to make you a minister and a witness, and that is your responsibility, and you must now share that.
[time=2925] Paul then realized that he had a moral obligation to the whole world.
[time=2929] And he said I must fulfill my obligation to share the good news of the gospel.
[time=2935] He says I've heard it, my life has been changed, my life has been transformed, and now I have a moral obligation to go into all the world as Jesus had and preach the gospel to every creature.
[time=2945] And so that's why he talks about the Greeks and the Romans and the barbarians and to the sophisticated and all kinds of people.
[time=2951] He says I have that kind of responsibility.
[time=2956] And each one of us are in debt to those people who live in areas around our home
[time=2963] and where we work and where we go to school.
[time=2965] We are morally in debt to share within the gospel.
[time=2971] Interesting thing took place with my next door neighbor.
[time=2975] I'm no longer a missionary pastor planting churches, but I am a Christian.
[time=2979] I'm a witness.
[time=2980] And so I've been talking with my neighbors, Fred and Pegg, and some other neighbors Earl and Suzette.
[time=2986] And so Pegg invites my wife and I over to the house for dinner.
[time=2988] So we get over there and we're having a good time learning about different things in our life and their life and the pegs is a norm.
[time=2996] And everybody would like to drink.
[time=2998] And I said, well, what do you have?
[time=3000] She says, well, we have some vodka, we have some beer, we have some light, we have some wine.
[time=3004] What would you like?
[time=3006] And I've taken a bottle of total abstinence and my wife has also.
[time=3010] And I said, do you have any Pepsi?
[time=3013] And she says, sure, but do you want anything else?
[time=3015] I said, no, I just like Pepsi.
[time=3016] I have some Pepsi, so I've got a can of Pepsi and I've got a can of Pepsi.
[time=3019] And they had a couple cans of other things.
[time=3021] And so finally the meal was ready.
[time=3024] So Pegg says, come on in.
[time=3025] So we went into dinner and we sat down, had a lovely dinner.
[time=3028] And all of a sudden I realized there were some nice wine glasses there.
[time=3031] And I knew what was coming.
[time=3032] So she said, Norm, what would you like?
[time=3034] Do you like some white wine or do you like some red wine?
[time=3037] And I said, if you don't mind, I'd just soon have some Pepsi.
[time=3040] She said, Pepsi?
[time=3041] I said, yeah, I really like Pepsi, you know that.
[time=3044] And so she said, okay, so I put Pepsi in a nice wine glass.
[time=3047] And she said, Evelyn, what do you want?
[time=3049] She said, I'll have some Pepsi too.
[time=3050] So we had Pepsi and they had some other things.
[time=3053] Then after the dinner was over, I knew the family room, and sure enough here comes Pegg again.
[time=3058] She says, Norm, what would you like to drink?
[time=3061] And I said, how about some Coke?
[time=3062] Do you have any Coke?
[time=3064] And so sure enough, she had some Coke.
[time=3066] And so they had a couple cans of beer.
[time=3068] And I saw a guitar over there and I said, Fred, you play the guitar.
[time=3072] And he says, yes, so he got the guitar out.
[time=3074] And Fred was feeling pretty good about that time.
[time=3076] So he pulls up the chair, he sits down and puts his can of beer down.
[time=3080] He calls Fred, calls Earl and says, Earl, come on, we're going to sing.
[time=3083] So he called me over there.
[time=3084] So there's Earl with his can of beer.
[time=3086] Fred was his can of Pegg and sues that with their cans of beer.
[time=3089] Evelyn and her can of Coke and me, if my can of Coke.
[time=3091] And we're singing way down upon the Swanee River on top of Old Smokey.
[time=3095] We're singing our way through the book.
[time=3097] And all of a sudden we come to the religious section of the book.
[time=3100] And they flip over.
[time=3101] I said, wait a minute, I know some of those songs.
[time=3103] So he stopped.
[time=3104] And I said, I'll teach you this one.
[time=3106] And it was amazing grace.
[time=3108] And it was, I looked at my wife and she was sort of chuckling.
[time=3112] And I was chuckling because it was such a unique situation.
[time=3115] And there they were with their cans of beer and feeling quite jolly, singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=3123] And I was chuckling and laughing to myself.
[time=3127] And I thought if Black Hawk Baptist Church could see me in this situation, they'd probably drop my financial support.
[time=3135] But you wouldn't do that.
[time=3136] Because as I was doing that, I was also praying in my heart.
[time=3139] You know what I was praying?
[time=3140] I said, oh God.
[time=3141] It helped me to have the opportunity to work with Peg and Fred, Earl and Suzanne so that someday they will sing from their heart amazing grace
[time=3151] how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=3157] And my wife and I've had the opportunity now to really work ourselves with the life of this couple, minister to them when they were in the hospital, when their son had a serious accident.
[time=3166] And God is opening up lines of communication so that we can share.
[time=3170] We're praying that that's going to become a reality because that's my responsibility.
[time=3173] I have a moral obligation to Peg and to Fred.
[time=3176] I can't live beside them as if I had no responsibility to them.
[time=3182] If God has placed me there, then it's my obligation to see that they hear the good news of the gospel.
[time=3187] And Paul said, I'm deader to all kinds of people, to the Greeks, the barbarians, the wise, the unwise,
[time=3193] any person that needs the gospel, it's my responsibility to share that with the gospel.
[time=3199] And if we have that kind of conviction, that'll make us a witness everywhere we go.
[time=3204] And notice in verse 15, so as much as in me is, I am now ready to preach the gospel to you that are home also.
[time=3211] Here's the third conviction.
[time=3212] He began by saying, I'm not ashamed of the gospel.
[time=3214] He says, I have a moral obligation to share the gospel.
[time=3217] And not only that, I'm going to do it right now.
[time=3219] I'm eager.
[time=3220] As much as in me is, I am ready.
[time=3222] I am eager.
[time=3223] I'm excited about preaching the gospel to you that are home also.
[time=3227] And Paul realized that once he got the wrong, there was a good possibility he would lose his life.
[time=3231] And that's exactly what has happened.
[time=3233] But he said, no matter what, he says, I'm eager.
[time=3235] I'm ready.
[time=3236] I'm excited.
[time=3237] I must be involved in sharing the gospel.
[time=3240] I must do it because it's my responsibility.
[time=3243] And I must do it now.
[time=3246] A few years ago, I was in Toledo, Ohio, and my father-in-law was having a difficult time.
[time=3252] And he said to me, Norm, he said, I just feel like a fifth wheel.
[time=3256] I knew what he meant because his wife had died.
[time=3259] And he was alone in the late '70s.
[time=3261] And he said, I just feel like a fifth wheel.
[time=3264] And I said, Dad, that's great.
[time=3266] And he said, you don't want to understand Norm.
[time=3268] He said, I just feel like a fifth wheel.
[time=3270] I said, Dad, that's great.
[time=3272] He said, I'm not talking about the steering wheel.
[time=3274] And I said, I'm not talking about steering wheel either.
[time=3277] I said, every car I've ever owned has five wheels.
[time=3280] I said, there's a spare tire in every car, every new car.
[time=3283] And I said, if the manufacturers or the cars feel that it's so important to have a spare tire have a fifth wheel, then it must be important.
[time=3290] And I said, Dad, just because you're 79, that there's no reason why you say you're no
[time=3296] good to anybody for anything.
[time=3298] I said, you've been a faithful man of God all your life.
[time=3300] And you ought to be trying to share your faith.
[time=3302] I said, are there anyone around here you could share your faith with?
[time=3304] I said, aren't there any widows that live here in the community?
[time=3307] She said, well, there's that.
[time=3308] Anna Burch, I said, why don't you talk to Anna?
[time=3310] She's not interested.
[time=3311] I said, Dad, it's your responsibility.
[time=3313] So he goes over and talks to Anna, and he invites her to church.
[time=3316] You know what she says?
[time=3317] I haven't been to church since I was 12 years old.
[time=3320] And I don't plan on ever darkening the doors of another church.
[time=3323] And she was 90 years old at this time.
[time=3326] It's been an awful long time since she's darkening the door of a church.
[time=3329] Well, what do you do with people who won't darken the doors of the church?
[time=3332] Well, you have to have a program for that.
[time=3334] So our church, we had a nice musical program out on the parking lot.
[time=3339] And Dad invites Anna.
[time=3341] She says, now, you don't have to win the church.
[time=3343] All you have to do is just go to the parking lot.
[time=3345] Don't have to darken the doors of the church.
[time=3347] You know, don't have to enter the church.
[time=3348] So Anna, without a excuse, she accepted the invitation.
[time=3352] So she came to the parking lot.
[time=3354] And she heard the music and a short message.
[time=3357] And, boy, these Baptists aren't so bad after all.
[time=3360] And Dad said, Anna, would you like to see the inside of the building?
[time=3362] So we went into the building after an Emmanuel Baptist in Toledo, Ohio, went into the building.
[time=3366] And she said, boy, this is a nice facility you have here.
[time=3369] So Dad said, would you like to come out just one of the Sunday morning services?
[time=3373] Well, I guess I could.
[time=3375] So she came to a Sunday morning service, then she started coming to a Sunday evening service.
[time=3378] And you know what happened on one Wednesday night as we showed an evangelistic film?
[time=3383] As the invitation was given, Anna Burch, not 91 years old, comes walking down the aisle
[time=3389] and says, I want to accept Christ as my personal Savior.
[time=3392] And she was saved and baptized and now a member of Emmanuel Baptist Church.
[time=3397] And she's in a nursing home now.
[time=3399] She's almost 93 now.
[time=3401] And I was just a few weeks ago.
[time=3403] I was visiting her.
[time=3404] And as we took her out of her drive, she was just crying.
[time=3407] She says, the happiest moment of my life is when I accepted Christ as my personal Savior.
[time=3414] And just think, if my dad would have said, I'm 79, I'm a widower, and I no longer have a ministry.
[time=3421] He realized that no matter what his life situation is, he had the responsibility to live the gospel.
[time=3429] That's what Paul said, as much as in me is, I am now ready to preach the gospel to you that are Rome also.
[time=3439] That's our responsibility.
[time=3442] You live and work beside people that I'll never contact, the pastor Rick will never contact, that other members of this church will never contact.
[time=3450] And it's your obligation.
[time=3451] It's your responsibility to reach them.
[time=3453] And I trust that you'll reach out in faith and say, I will share the gospel by faith with them.
[time=3461] Shall we pray?
[time=3470] [MUSIC]

[time=3517] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me of my sin.
[time=3522] I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3526] Give me a new life.
[time=3527] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
