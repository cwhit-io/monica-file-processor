[time=60] The Bible is always relevant.
[time=83] The book of Proverbs particularly so as it speaks to one of the most striking issues of our day not as the issue of sexual purity as we watch the television or as we listen to
[time=95] the radio or pick up a magazine or confronted with it on every verse of a song every script
[time=102] of the TV dialogue and every page of the magazine it's around us and it's being pushed upon
[time=110] us much of society talks about freeness and openness and sex but they fail to tell us
[time=116] about the hurt and the devastating consequences when we violate God's word one person put their
[time=123] uncertainty in this way it was a song sung by Carol King it said tonight you're mine so
[time=132] completely you give your love so sweetly tonight the magic of love is in your eyes but will
[time=144] you still love me tomorrow will you still love me tomorrow sex has become one of the
[time=153] most confusing issues of every area of our life but God has a word for us today Welcome to the Bible hour with Pastor Rick Hawks we're glad you've joined us today Rick's
[time=177] message is entitled avoiding the affair one of the major themes of Proverbs is warning against the dangers of yielding to sexual temptation in fact this very theme comes up eight times in Solomon's instructions to his son two entire chapters are devoted to admonishing him to keep his purity please locate your Bible so that you're able to study with us the sanctuary
[time=198] choir and orchestra will be bringing us a song entitled Grace Medley other special music includes a song from the kindergarten class of the Black Hawk Christian School a piano
[time=209] solo from Brenda Archer and a song from celebration the Bible hour is an outreach
[time=217] ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time we pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you now here's Rick and we've come today to sing praises to our God to declare his goodness and to sing how
[time=247] great thou art this is an hour of worship we've come today to magnify the name of the
[time=253] Lord thank you for being a part of this worship service we're delighted that you've come today
[time=259] the Psalmist said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord it's our prayer and our hearts desire that God creates an atmosphere here that refreshes
[time=269] us and restores us spiritually that there's really a sense in our heart where we're saying man I'm glad I was there today we also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now by way of television as we share with many others who couldn't come today or perhaps should have but didn't we trust that today God will use our hour of worship first of all to glorify his name and then to produce growth in our lives all that we have all that we
[time=295] possess spiritually is a gift from God in a word the Bible says it's grace God's riches
[time=302] at Christ's expense and so we begin today with a medley of songs that speak of the grace
[time=308] that God has given to us.
[time=324] Praise God's grace, grace that the part of and comes with it, grace that is filled with
[time=341] love our sin.
[time=357] Praise God's grace, grace that the part of and comes with it, grace that the part of
[time=380] and that the part of and comes with it, grace that the part of and comes with it, grace

[time=609] in order hymn number four and hymn number 72.
[time=627] [MUSIC - 144 seconds]
[time=788] Last month, March, we emphasized in our church missions our individual responsibility is
[time=794] believers to share Christ and beyond our own lives to have an impact on this entire globe for Christ.
[time=801] This month, we're emphasizing the ministry of our school, Black Hawk Christian School, and so today, we've huddled together part of our kindergarten class.
[time=810] The theory is this, if you can teach kindergarteners to sing, you can teach anybody to sing.
[time=815] And so, Rich and Linda have worked with them, and then after they sing, one of our high school students, Brenda Archer is going to play for us, and excellent him entitled, "It is Well
[time=826] With My Soul," but first, the kindergarteners.
[time=831] [MUSIC - 83 seconds]
[time=927] [APPLAUSE]
[time=942] [MUSIC - 272 seconds]
[time=1239] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1247] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today here on the Bible Hour.
[time=1252] Normally, Pete Kobe, our Minister of Music, shares these moments with us, but today, we've asked our school administrator,
[time=1258] Steve Longbrake, to be a part of the Bible Hour.
[time=1261] Steve, these are exciting days for Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1265] They sure are, we have experienced our greatest enrollment this past year, and the spiritual level at the school has just been really dynamic, I'm thrilled.
[time=1274] Also, we're looking forward to next year's enrollment being even greater because we've had re-registration that's been higher than ever before.
[time=1281] I understand some of the classes are already filled to capacity.
[time=1285] Yes, a few of our classes are full, but several are still open, and we really would encourage you if you're interested to apply now.
[time=1291] Many of you are familiar with our school because you regularly watch the Bible Hour, but for those of you who are not, Black Hawk Christian School is a fully accredited Christian school,
[time=1302] starting with Kindergarten, which Kathy and I've had two Kindergarteners here at Black Hawk each of the last years, all the way through the senior year,
[time=1311] and our graduates literally go on to every type of college and are well prepared.
[time=1315] Yes, we've had students attending schools in Indiana and other states around the country, all kinds of colleges, Christian schools and secular schools alike, and they've been doing very well.
[time=1324] Oh, that's exciting to hear.
[time=1326] As a matter of fact, one of our former graduates is herself a graduate of college now and coming back to Black Hawk.
[time=1333] Yes, that's an encouragement to us as well.
[time=1335] We have a former student who was valedictorian here and has maintained a 4.0 average in college all the four years that she's been there,
[time=1343] and now applying to teaching our elementary school.
[time=1346] Well, that's exciting. Do we get quite a few new teachers each year or is the turnover rather low?
[time=1352] We're thankful that our turnover rate has been extremely low, and that's one of the reasons that I feel our school has been successful.
[time=1360] We lose about one teacher per year at the most.
[time=1363] And that's usually to marry your motherhood, isn't it?
[time=1366] Yes, it is. We have a couple mothers leaving this year.
[time=1369] Well, we are certainly excited about our school, and Kathy and I are particularly excited.
[time=1376] The CR children growing academically, it's exciting.
[time=1380] I know that I didn't read as well, and the fourth or fifth grade as Rachel was reading in the first grade.
[time=1385] And yet at the same time with that academic progress, there's a great spiritual foundation.
[time=1390] So, from Kathy and me to you, thanks for the great job you're doing leading our school.
[time=1395] You're welcome. I'm glad your children are there.
[time=1397] Well, it's a joy for us. Tell our viewers how they can get more information about the school, please.
[time=1402] We'd love to answer any questions that you might have about our school.
[time=1407] You can call us at 749-8524 or write the school at 1371 East State Street in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1417] Thanks, Steve. As a part of our philosophy of education, we have this theme, "Academic Excellence on a Biblical Foundation." It's important to learn all the disciplines of science and literature and all the reading, writing and arithmetic,
[time=1432] but there has to be a Biblical foundation in education, but there also has to be a Biblical foundation in every part of our life.
[time=1439] And so today, we want to share this booklet with you that has the title "Promises from Proverbs."
[time=1445] This is a topical arrangement of many of the Proverbs of the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1450] By topical, I mean, you can look up topics like purity or plans
[time=1456] or what the Bible has to say about money and riches or discipline and self-control or prayer.
[time=1462] This booklet will help give you an index on some of the key issues of life, and some of them I'm sure you're facing today.
[time=1469] This is a booklet we'd be glad to send you as a gift from us to you to strengthen your foundation in the scriptures.
[time=1477] If you'd like a copy, please simply write to us today at the Bible Hour,
[time=1483] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1491] Once again, the address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1499] zip code 46815. If you'll write to us, simply ask for the book on Proverbs, and we'll send it to you in the mail right away.
[time=1508] As we go back to our morning worship service, I hope that you'll open up your Bible to the Book of Proverbs and to study with us on a very relevant and appropriate topic, very direct.
[time=1519] The Bible says a great deal about sexual purity, and today we'll be talking about avoiding the affair.
[time=1526] Thanks for being a part of the Bible Hour today. Steve, thank you for being here and representing our school.
[time=1531] Thank you for having me.
[time=1556] [MUSIC - 208 seconds]
[time=1778] Thank you. Let us pray together. God in our hearts, we would worship you today. We would pray of this body of people that you would unite us, keep us undivided. Father, we would pray that there would be a unity of the body and the bond of peace.
[time=1803] That this place might be a place where conflicts are resolved and tensions released. Keep this church and all of your churches, Lord, from being in the focal point of division. Lord, we love you.
[time=1817] Father, some here may like the tradition, others may like that which is different, but God give us a love for you and for one another that overwhelmingly dictates our attitude.
[time=1832] Lord, thank you for the purpose that we sense when we worship you. We pray today for those who have come, and this is all new to them, that they would see today not a church service and certainly not a speaker.
[time=1848] But they would see in your word that you love them and that they might see your Son Jesus Christ. Father, we pray for those who have come here so often that they can finish every verse that's ever read. They've memorized all the hymns that we could possibly sing, and they're bored.
[time=1868] God, make us fresh today. Help us to do the usual things in such an unusual way that it delights our hearts as we praise you.
[time=1879] Father, we pray today that you would comfort those who are suffering. Pray for Lloyd Hicks that he would recover from a back surgery, particularly for Helen Larmen as she is recovering from a heart failure.
[time=1896] We pray today for Jim Joy that you would give his doctors wisdom, that you would strengthen him in the inner man and his wife Phyllis.
[time=1906] Father, today we rejoice with those who are rejoicing today, those who have had great weeks, weeks of adventure, weeks of fulfillment.
[time=1915] We thank you for the gift of a baby girl that was given to Joe and Joyce Dodie. We pray for our church father that we would have babies, not physically, but spiritually, every day.
[time=1930] There would be those who would take that initial step and receive Christ. Father, through your word, we ask you to speak to us today. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1943] If you have a Bible, I want to invite you to open it with me to Proverbs 6. For those of you who don't have a Bible, please don't feel uncomfortable or awkward.
[time=1954] We're glad you're here with us. If you come again and we hope you do, we would encourage you to bring a Bible. That's our study here at Blackhawk.
[time=1962] For those of you who can't find Proverbs, don't feel badly. The first book of the Bible is called "contents." And if you'll turn to the table of contents, it'll be listed there.
[time=1971] In my Bible, I looked it up and Proverbs begins on page 647. That'll help you. Don't feel awkward if you don't know all of the places we turn to. That's all right. Study with us.
[time=1984] We're studying through Proverbs. Proverbs is a very topical book. Some books of the Bible are actually letters that somebody like Paul or Peter wrote to an audience and they seem to flow together. Proverbs is not like that.
[time=1998] Three or four Proverbs may have a theme and then suddenly, like that, they change themes. And so as we study it, it is a thematic study.
[time=2007] What we've done here is we began with Proverbs chapter 1 and established the theme, and we're addressing each of the themes as they come up.
[time=2016] And I probably say, "Why has he taken all this time to tell us why we're studying and what we're studying?" Well, the reason why I'm telling you what we're studying is today, we're not studying something in reaction to what you read in the newspaper.
[time=2028] Nor are we studying in reaction to what may have happened in somebody's private world. So if today, as I begin to speak, if you say, "Did my husband call him?"
[time=2036] Probably didn't. We're simply studying what was planned for our church weeks ago.
[time=2042] Now, you're probably dying to know what we're studying about. Proverbs chapter 6, verse 20, has as its theme, moral purity.
[time=2053] Talking about our sex lives. George Lantman said, "What do you think people thought after the first service?"
[time=2059] And I said, "I don't know yet." And he said, "Well, there's a lot of people who'd like to sweep it under the carpet." And I began to think, "Yeah, a lot of people would like to sweep it under the carpet and then crawl in there after it."
[time=2070] Proverbs chapter 6, verse 20, "My son, keep your father's commands."
[time=2076] Boy, I heard that when I was growing up and we weren't even Christians.
[time=2080] "And do not forsake your mother's teaching. Bind them upon your heart forever.
[time=2087] Fasten them around your neck. When you walk, they will guide you. When you sleep, they will watch over you.
[time=2096] When you awake, they will speak to you. For these commands are our lamp.
[time=2103] This teaching is a light and the corrections of discipline are the way of life, keeping you from the immoral woman.
[time=2115] From the smooth tongue of the wayward wife. Do not lust in your heart after her or let her captivate you with her eyes.
[time=2129] For the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread and the adulterous praise upon your very life.
[time=2139] Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?
[time=2144] Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?
[time=2149] So is he who sleeps with another man's wife. No one who touches her will go unpunished."
[time=2157] In the book of Proverbs, this theme of human sexuality occurs as one of the major themes of the book.
[time=2164] There are eight different times in the 31 chapters of Proverbs that human sexuality occurs.
[time=2170] That's not counting places where it simply talks about being a good husband or being a good wife.
[time=2175] I mean just plain talks about sex. As a matter of fact, it not only occurs eight different times, but two entire chapters are given over to this theme.
[time=2186] Proverbs chapter five and chapter seven exclusively deal with this subject.
[time=2192] I think it's probably one of the most important things that we need to talk about.
[time=2196] Because we're being talked to about sex constantly from a different dimension.
[time=2203] One of those dimension is obviously television. When you watch television, you and I are bombarded.
[time=2211] Constantly with sexual themes and sexual overtones and sometimes on regular television, just plain sexual explicitness.
[time=2222] When we turn on the radio, whether you listen to the contemporary rock artist or whether you listen to the country music, the reoccurring theme is sex.
[time=2234] Romance. If it's the rock artist, he says, "I dig your body, you blow my mind."
[time=2241] If it's the country artist, he said, "Why did you leave me for 40 other lovers?" But the theme's the same.
[time=2248] And if you listen to the easy listening station, they just tone it down and it's far more subtle.
[time=2254] Someone has said that the rock music is the sex drive of men and the contemporary soft music is the sex drive of the women.
[time=2262] We are bombarded with it. It sells cars, it sells toothpaste.
[time=2267] All based upon it's going to give us a new sexual dimension.
[time=2272] Therefore, because we're surrounded with that input, we better balance the scale from a biblical perspective.
[time=2278] What would God have to say? Now if you'll notice this, this seems to be gender oriented.
[time=2284] By that, it seems to be looking at it only from the man's perspective. It begins with verse 20, "My son."
[time=2292] Please don't feel like Solomon is casting women in a bad light, and he's only addressing the needs of men.
[time=2298] The word of God was written for men and women alike. Solomon though had a unique purpose.
[time=2304] He had gone through some tough valleys in his life, and his whole purpose, I believe in writing proverbs, was to try to keep his son from making the same mistake.
[time=2313] But it has equal balance for men and for women.
[time=2318] So it's written to a son, and so he's warning them about the entrapment of sexuality with other women.
[time=2325] It could just as easily be switched and be written to a daughter about the sexual entrapment of men.
[time=2332] Please don't feel this is one-sided.
[time=2334] And in the times in which we live, it's very, very needed.
[time=2337] The tidal wave of the women's movement has flooded upon us, and we now have gained a number of positive benefits from the women's movement and a number of negative ones.
[time=2348] Positively, many women now are getting paid far closer to what they deserve because of the women's movement.
[time=2354] Lots of jobs that have been somewhat unofficially closed to women are now open to women, and that's been good.
[time=2362] But there's been some negative sides as well.
[time=2365] Do you know that 20 years ago that there was hardly a woman that they could find who was what is now called type A behavior?
[time=2373] For those of you who don't know what type behavior is, that means it's a highly dominant, driven type personality who's very project oriented, not nearly as people oriented.
[time=2383] People who are polyphasic that have to be shaving while they watch the TV, while they're weighing themselves on the scale.
[time=2390] You've got to do two or three things at once. Women didn't have that syndrome.
[time=2394] Now that they've entered into the working world with men, they are classics, class A behavior.
[time=2400] And because of the women's movement, we're no longer denying women their equal rights.
[time=2406] We not only have Playboy, we now Playgirl magazine, the United States government says you have equal rights to lust and to pollute your mind.
[time=2414] So what we're studying here isn't chauvinistic, it's for both.
[time=2419] Now before we dig into Proverbs, we need to re-identify what God's basic thinking about sex and sexuality is.
[time=2428] Let me give you three very simple statements.
[time=2430] Statement number one, God created sex. It wasn't something that Satan created, it wasn't something that came about after the fall, it wasn't something that human beings came up with.
[time=2441] God created it, and after God created it, he said it was very good.
[time=2449] Second thing I believe the Bible teaches about sex is that sex was made for intimate enjoyment.
[time=2455] Now centuries ago, when maybe even some today would teach that sex is only for reproducing children, if that's the case, the world's full and there's no longer need for sex.
[time=2466] But I believe the scripture says that God created sex not only for reproduction, but for a shared intimacy between a husband and a wife.
[time=2476] You know, God created all of the animal world, and he created them male and female.
[time=2482] And then God created Adam, just one man, and God says it's not good that Adam should be alone, he needed a partner.
[time=2490] But God did not create for him another man so that the two of them could go fishing and hunting together and get a game of one on one going on.
[time=2499] God created a woman for them.
[time=2501] Now when God created Adam, and then he brought Eve to Adam, Adam looked at all the animals and saw, no, this isn't an animal, this was a man.
[time=2513] But he said, whoa, man.
[time=2516] And hence the name woman has come into our vocabulary.
[time=2521] And that proves beyond a doubt that God created a sexually for appreciation and enjoyment with each other.
[time=2527] Now you'd probably like a different reference to prove that point, let me give you one.
[time=2533] Proverbs chapter five.
[time=2536] Now this is kind of explicit, but it's Bible, so I'm safe.
[time=2541] It says, drink water from your own sister and running water from your own well.
[time=2547] Should your springs overflow in the streets and your streams and the waters of public squares, let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
[time=2556] May your fountain be blessed and you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
[time=2563] Now there's two possible interpretations there.
[time=2566] Either Solomon's talking about this well, he's gotten his backyard that he dug and it took centuries, or he's talking about a physical relationship with his wife.
[time=2575] Obviously it's the latter.
[time=2577] And he says, God's designed marriage and intimacy to be enjoyed with one another. Sex is not a dirty word.
[time=2587] Third thing the Bible says about sex, God created it, that's for secondly he created it for enjoyment.
[time=2592] Thirdly he created it for enjoyment within the security and intimacy of marriage.
[time=2598] You see one, two people are married, the Bible says one, the husband leaves his mother and father, the wife leaves her mother and father,
[time=2606] and it says, and the two are joined together.
[time=2609] The Hebrew word actually means they're adhered together like glue.
[time=2613] Sociologically and anthropologically we've come up with an excellent word, it's called bonded.
[time=2619] You see when you get married, all kinds of things change.
[time=2624] You used to have a preferred type of toothpaste.
[time=2632] And there was probably some discussion over which would be the resolved type of toothpaste.
[time=2638] And you resolved that, and now you have your third type of toothpaste, and you've come to that agreement.
[time=2645] It sounds so trite, doesn't it?
[time=2647] But you know what, marriage has nothing more than taking my values and her values and saying, let's go with yours and next time let's go with mine.
[time=2654] Third one, both of our parents were wrong and now we're going to do it right.
[time=2658] That's called bonding where you just simply begin to take your two lives and tie them together at every possible point.
[time=2665] You not only live together, but after a while you begin to talk alike.
[time=2670] After a while you begin to like the same type of television shows.
[time=2678] You know, before Kathy and I were ever married, neither one of us ate much barbecued food.
[time=2684] But we discovered barbecuing together, and this is without exaggeration.
[time=2689] We often buy barbecued sauce by the seven pound jar.
[time=2694] I mean, we love that stuff.
[time=2696] This last week we had our tenth anniversary.
[time=2699] You know, we went out for barbecue and we just ate those ribs and we all ate good.
[time=2703] You know what, that's just another little point of contact and we're bonded together.
[time=2709] And God says when you are married, the two of you, you start developing the same qualities, the same likenesses.
[time=2717] Everything becomes shared and it's in that bonded relationship of marriage that God designed sex.
[time=2724] And in life, God says those are the ground rules.
[time=2727] I want you to have it.
[time=2728] I want you to enjoy it.
[time=2729] And here's the structure.
[time=2730] One man, one woman, partners for life.
[time=2734] And when you do that, God says you'll find joy and you'll find fulfillment.
[time=2738] You break that, you're on a conclusion course with life.
[time=2743] That bonding is so important.
[time=2746] Let me give you two illustrations of the tragic consequences.
[time=2749] The first is written in Josh McDowell's excellent book, "Givers, Takers, and Other Kinds of Lovers."
[time=2756] Story is told about Gretchen.
[time=2757] She's a freshman at San Jose State University.
[time=2761] These are Gretchen's own words.
[time=2763] "I arrived for my freshman year, equipped with everything I needed.
[time=2767] I had my number two pencil, my student identification card, and a good supply of birth control pills.
[time=2773] I was ready for the great life." Later she writes, "After a semester of the great life, I felt dirty and used and discarded."
[time=2789] You see, whenever you take what God has given by way of sex and we misuse it, then we are not the victors.
[time=2796] We are the victims." A second illustration.
[time=2802] Some of you grew up listening to a very popular musical artist by the name of Carol King.
[time=2808] She, in an excellent way, laments the fears and the tragedies of sex outside of marriage.
[time=2816] The song begins with these words.
[time=2819] "Tonight your mind so completely you give your love so sweetly."
[time=2827] "Tonight the magic of love is in your eyes, but will you still love me tomorrow?"
[time=2837] I wish I could sing because if you heard that song sung, it is even more powerful.
[time=2843] Because the first three lines have an energy and an obvious excitement.
[time=2848] "Tonight your mind so completely you give your love so sweetly." "Wow, the magic. It's in your eyes." And then the song changes to the fearfulness.
[time=2860] "But will you still love me tomorrow?" You see, God says it's good and it's meant to be enjoyed, but it can only be a fulfilling relationship
[time=2872] within the rules that God made.
[time=2874] And everything in life has to have rules.
[time=2876] Could you imagine a baseball game without rules?
[time=2878] You're the pitcher. You get up and you just heave your arm off that mound.
[time=2882] You strike out the first three guys.
[time=2884] You start to walk off the mound and they send up a fourth batter.
[time=2887] You say, "No, that's three outs. Your side's retired." And they say, "No, that's just for you. We get four or five guys." You go back up there and you pitch and that guy finally gets ahold of one of those balls and he knocks it flying this one. But it just goes outside the foul pole and you've got away with that.
[time=2903] And all of a sudden his team stands up and yells, "Home run!" You say, "No, no, it was outside the foul pole. No, that foul pole is just for you guys.
[time=2911] If we get it out of here, that's good." See, you can't have a baseball game like that. You're right.
[time=2917] You've got to have rules. You've got to have structures.
[time=2920] Or it all becomes meaningless.
[time=2923] Could you imagine driving in a city where there's no rules?
[time=2930] Everybody goes as fast or as slow as they want to.
[time=2933] You can turn right from the left-hand lane. You can turn left from the right-hand lane.
[time=2937] You can do a u-turn on any intersection you want to do.
[time=2940] And whoever gets to the intersection first goes first.
[time=2945] There's a place. It's called Manila. And that's how they drive there.
[time=2950] When you are in that lovely city, it's like being at the turnpike cruisers at Cedar Point.
[time=2957] Now, if you don't know what the turnpike cruisers, it's the little cars where the kids can drive.
[time=2961] The kids can't reach the pedal, but they can reach the horn.
[time=2964] And it just beep, beep, beep, beep. And that's when you're in Manila, whoever gets to the intersection first and lays on their horn, they win.
[time=2973] You say, "You can't drive like it. You're right. You can't drive like that." And you know what? You can't live like that either.
[time=2978] You can't live and say, "There are no rules. I can turn here. I can turn there. I can do whatever I want to do."
[time=2984] You can't do that. It won't work.
[time=2989] That's what Solomon's trying to tell us here.
[time=2993] God has created sex. He's called it good. He said, "It's very good." He said, "Enjoy one another intimately, but it's designed for the confines of marriage."
[time=3003] Now back to Proverbs 6. In verses 24 and 26, it describes immorality in two completely different modes.
[time=3013] It says, "The word of God will keep you from the immoral woman and from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife."
[time=3021] Then in verse 26, "From the prostitute who reduces you to a loaf of bread and from the adulterous who prays upon your very life."
[time=3032] First of all, it talks about an immoral woman and then a prostitute.
[time=3038] And then I believe very different than that. He talks about a wayward wife and an adulterous.
[time=3045] The first describes a relationship that there's no bonding between the two. It's simply immorality.
[time=3054] It uses a strong word, the word prostitution. Obviously that has a specific meaning to us. That means sex for money.
[time=3061] But look again at verse 26. It says, "The prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread."
[time=3068] What that's saying there is this. A loaf of bread in that day represented the basic substance of life.
[time=3077] People, by and large, didn't work to save up money to buy an extra car or a boat or a college education.
[time=3083] Most people live subsistently. They got just enough money today to buy a loaf of bread to live off of.
[time=3092] And what he's talking about here is not simply sex for money, but sex as a commodity, as a loaf of bread, something that is exchanged.
[time=3103] It can mean exchange for a lot of things. Obviously there are those that exchange sex for money, the technical sense of prostitution.
[time=3111] But there are a lot of other exchanges. Some people exchange sex for security.
[time=3117] You're afraid that if you don't give that partner that you're dating what they want from you sexually, then they'll leave you.
[time=3124] And they'll go find someone else who will do that. And so you compromise your convictions and you give sex in exchange for security.
[time=3135] Others involve themselves in sex in exchange for status. There are some people who their self-esteem is inadequate.
[time=3144] And the only way they feel like they are really something is that they have been involved in a sexual adventure.
[time=3152] They like to use the word conquest. It gives them a status that is lacking in their personality.
[time=3159] It's their personality that is lacking. But because of their need for control and power and status, they're involved.
[time=3167] Roger Stalbach, former quarterback of the Cowboys, made an excellent insight.
[time=3173] He was a great quarterback and there were several other great quarterbacks who were his contemporaries.
[time=3178] One received an awful lot of press not just for his ability with a football but for his ability with the women.
[time=3185] Stalbach was asked to have bothered him that this other man received all the publicity and if this other man who was held up with such a man's man really wasn't getting more of the press.
[time=3200] Stalbach said it doesn't bother me at all. And for the sex side of it, I'm probably as sexually active as he is.
[time=3209] Only difference is mine's all with one woman who I love and I've committed my life to.
[time=3216] Some people are exchanging sex for status. Other people are exchanging sex for acceptance.
[time=3224] I'm amazed at how many of us here travel in our business and we travel often with the same cadre of guys.
[time=3233] And they're like junior high boys when mom and dad aren't home. They stay up late and they take things they're not supposed to take out the refrigerator.
[time=3240] But now we're not junior high boys. We're in our 20s, 30s and 40s. We're out of town and no one will know and so we go to all the places where the action is.
[time=3250] And then some who have convictions to be different don't.
[time=3255] But some who have convictions to be different do because if they don't everyone else won't accept them.
[time=3262] And so they engage in sex in exchange for acceptance.
[time=3267] Well regardless of what we're exchanging, what we've done is we've reduced our bodies and our life to nothing more than a commodity of exchange.
[time=3277] The Bible says you're just another loaf of bread to be bought and to be sold.
[time=3281] Joseph Fletcher wrote a book called Situational Ethics, very little of which I agree with except for his opening story.
[time=3288] An obviously wealthy man, a known millionaire said to a young lady with a clear proposition would she make such an exchange, sex for money.
[time=3299] The amount of money was enormous and she agreed.
[time=3303] So the millionaire retracted and only offered half as much money but it was still a sizable sum and she again agreed.
[time=3310] And then the third negotiation was struck and she agreed again for even less of a price.
[time=3315] And finally a fourth offer was given at a greatly diminished financial return and the young woman became upset and she said,
[time=3322] "What do you think I am?" Millionaire said, "We've already established what you are. We're just talking about the price."
[time=3330] You see whenever we exchange sex or anything else, we've already established what we are.
[time=3336] We're just talking about the price. For somebody they're willing to pay money, for someone else it's that they want status.
[time=3341] For someone else it's security, for someone else it's acceptance.
[time=3345] But we end up using our bodies as an exchange and we're the losers.
[time=3350] There's an entirely different approach though when it talks about the wayward wife and the adulterous.
[time=3357] Now one are both of the people are married and there's far more happening here than just sexual impurity.
[time=3364] There's the breaking of a bond.
[time=3367] You see when a man and a woman are married and they're bonded together and then one of them breaks that sexual purity,
[time=3375] they're breaking that trust, that bond.
[time=3378] That if I can't trust you with the secrets we've exchanged with our body, it undermines every secret we've ever had.
[time=3385] Every joy we've ever shared has now been put on the table and compromised.
[time=3391] The bond has been broken.
[time=3394] And it says in verse 26, the prostitute, that relationship reduces you to a commodity
[time=3401] but when you engage in adultery, that prays upon your entire life.
[time=3407] You see when you commit an immoral relationship as a married person or with a married person,
[time=3414] you're not only there before destroyed your life but you've altered the life of your spouse.
[time=3420] That person's spouse, the bond has been broken.
[time=3425] And while the first is absolutely sinful and totally wrong, the second may even be worse because of the complications it brings on.
[time=3436] Well, in this particular passage, I believe the key thing that we're supposed to learn is that our bodies belong to God.
[time=3446] He's bought us with a price and we must follow His directives because if we break God's plan for our bodies,
[time=3455] then we're either reducing ourselves to a commodity, to be bought and sold, or we're breaking the bond.
[time=3461] And it's a commitment we've made before Him and before our spouse and we're guaranteed to lose unless we surrender to Christ.
[time=3470] Now back here in Proverbs, I believe you.

[time=3519] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3522] I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of my sins.
