[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] >> All of us need other people in our lives, friends.
[time=111] What is a real friend?
[time=113] When missionaries came to this country and began working with the American Indians, they found that there was no single word for friend.
[time=122] Instead, there was a phrase.
[time=124] A friend was one according to the Indians, one who carried my sorrows on his back.
[time=132] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=149] Thank you for joining us.
[time=151] Rick's message today is entitled "Friendship, the Search for the Ultimate," and is taken
[time=157] from John chapter 15.
[time=160] This study contains important qualities of friendship and some equally important warnings as well.
[time=166] Jesus gave us the privilege of calling him our friend.
[time=170] In fact, he is a friend exactly like the one Rick just described, one who carries my sorrows on his back.
[time=178] We encourage you to locate your Bible and study along with us as we look at John chapter 15 verses 13 through 15.
[time=187] We will be hearing special music from our own sanctuary choir.
[time=193] Today's special guest, Phil Nash, will be bringing a dramatic presentation.
[time=200] Other special music includes a song from the Music Gallery.
[time=206] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=215] We pray that the Lord will use this Telecaste to minister to you.
[time=220] Now here's Rick.
[time=221] We're delighted that you're here.
[time=223] We also want to welcome and thank our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=228] This Sunday is Palm Sunday.
[time=230] Historically, it was the day that Jesus entered Jerusalem triumphantly.
[time=235] They recognized him.
[time=236] He had risen Lazarus from the grave.
[time=240] They provided miracles, public opinion was an all-time high, and on this occasion they
[time=247] were shouting "Hosanna," "Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord."
[time=270] "Hosanna," "Hosanna," "Hosanna," "Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord."
[time=292] Join for the song that we sing.
[time=300] Hosanna is happy, and hearts true are for you.
[time=308] Worship the glory, King, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=317] Only might we know Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=321] Jesus, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=350] Jesus, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=364] Jesus, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
