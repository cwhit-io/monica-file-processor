[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] Throughout the centuries, there have always been critics of Christianity.
[time=109] The most intense were those who actually began to do the investigative work of examining the claims of the scripture.
[time=117] Of course, they were driven to study one central issue.
[time=121] That is the reality of the resurrection.
[time=125] During the 1700s, George Littleton and Sir Gilbert West began such a study.
[time=131] In the midst of their investigation, they came to the conclusion that Christ had indeed risen from the grave.
[time=138] More recently, a man by the name of Sir William Ramsey started out as an archeologist to disprove the claims of the resurrection.
[time=149] And through his study, he also came to Christ.
[time=153] Even more recently, the writer Lou Wallace began a novel to expose Christ as a mere man.
[time=161] But in the course of his research, he came to the conclusion that Christ was more than a man,
[time=167] and he wrote an epic story depicting Christ as God.
[time=171] The story was been heard.
[time=174] Then even today, there are men who are searching for Christ, who in our generation have come to the realization
[time=180] that he is indeed the Messiah, men like Josh McDowell, or Frank Morrison who wrote a book entitled "Who Moved the Stone?" Did Jesus?
[time=191] Did the disciples?
[time=193] Did the Jews?
[time=194] Did the Romans or did God raise his son from the dead?
[time=198] Who moved the stone?
[time=200] That's the question we'll investigate right now.
[time=204] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=221] We're glad you've chosen to join us.
[time=224] Rick's message today is entitled "Confidence in the Resurrection." Since the death and resurrection of Christ, scholars and common men and women have investigated the reality of the resurrection.
[time=237] Many like those Rick just mentioned began his adamant opposers, but through their search became determined defenders of the faith.
[time=246] We hope today's study will help many of you come to Christ in confidence.
[time=251] Please locate your Bibles so that you are able to study with us.
[time=255] We will be looking at Matthew 27, 62 through 28, 10.
[time=261] The sanctuary choir will be sharing a song with us.
[time=266] We will also be hearing special music from the Men's Singers Quartet,
[time=272] our own Handbell choir, and Marilyn Wong.
[time=279] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=288] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=293] Now here's Rick.
[time=295] And we also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=299] We trust that during this hour our faith in Christ will be strengthened and fortified and will leave this place with a confidence.
[time=307] Not only that Christ is alive, but because He is alive, we have living in us resurrection power.
[time=314] Bells have often been a tradition in the symbol of the fact that they ring forth that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=322] Hear the bells ringing.
[time=323] They're singing that He has risen from the dead.
[time=326] Hear the bells ringing.
[time=328] They're singing that we can be born again.
[time=341] Hear the bells ringing.
[time=343] They're singing that we can be born again.
[time=349] Hear the bells ringing.
[time=351] They're singing Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=357] The angel upon the tombstone said He is risen just as He said.
[time=365] Quickly now go tell His disciples that Jesus Christ is no longer dead.
[time=375] Joy to the world.
[time=378] He is risen.
[time=381] Hallelujah.
[time=383] He's risen.
[time=385] Hallelujah.
[time=387] He's risen.
[time=389] Hallelujah.
[time=397] Hear the bells ringing.
[time=406] They're singing that we can be born again.
[time=413] Hear the bells ringing.
[time=415] They're singing Christ is risen from the dead.
[time=421] The angel upon the tombstone said He is risen just as He said.
[time=429] Quickly now go tell His disciples that Jesus Christ is no longer dead.
[time=439] Joy to the world.
[time=454] Hallelujah.
[time=467] Hear the bells ringing.
[time=484] Hallelujah.
[time=1274] Good morning and Happy Easter. This is Easter Sunday morning here at Blackhawk.
[time=1278] I know it's a week later in South Bend and Marian, so please accept our belated Happy Easter.
[time=1284] We hope that the worship today brings us all to a greater confidence in our faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1290] We're standing on the set of our Easter music column. Pete, I'm certainly looking forward to that tonight.
[time=1296] Oh, Rick, we've had an exciting time reviewing the music and preparing for it and the drama and just really getting into the message of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1304] And tonight we'll be presenting the musical entitled "Now I See You" at the Blackhawk Baptist Church Convocation Center.
[time=1311] That program begins at 6 p.m. I hope that any of you that are watching and you have a free evening that you can come and join us for this grand celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ as we see it through the eyes of Judas and Peter.
[time=1325] Well, I'm looking forward to that and certainly want to add my encouragement to Pete's.
[time=1330] That if you're watching here in Fort Wayne today and if you can possibly come at 6 o'clock, I know you won't be disappointed.
[time=1337] I want to also thank those of you who came to join us Friday for our Good Friday service at the Grand Wayne.
[time=1343] We literally had hundreds more people than we ever anticipated and your encouragement and presence and worship with us that day was really exciting.
[time=1352] You know, Rick, it was exciting to see some of the people that say they watched the Bible Hour and then they came with us to join with us live in this celebration.
[time=1362] And it was a grand time together and also from time to time we get letters and cards from people telling us that they watched the Bible Hour.
[time=1369] That's certainly encouraging to all of us here.
[time=1372] You know, those cards and letters do mean a great deal and I brought one this morning just because it was so special.
[time=1378] It comes from Mildred Lebel. She lives in a nursing home because of her age and health. She can't write, but let me share this letter with you.
[time=1387] It says I'm writing this letter for a little lady in a nursing home in Auburn, Indiana.
[time=1393] She herself cannot write any longer.
[time=1396] She told me the other day that she wished there was some way to tell you how much she enjoys the services on Sunday morning.
[time=1404] She sings along with you and the choir and she has tears coming from her eyes.
[time=1410] She really listens and gets a great blessing from all of this and also from your messages from the Word.
[time=1417] Well, we greatly appreciate those cards.
[time=1420] It tells us that God is using this in the life of some very special people.
[time=1424] And to Mildred and all of you, we wish that God would fill your heart with the confidence that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1431] Not just this Easter, but every day of your life.
[time=1435] Your faith in Christ will grow proportionate to your study of God's Word.
[time=1440] And we have a Bible study booklet to help you do that and we're going to share that with you right now.
[time=1446] If you'll simply write to us today, we'll send you an excellent little booklet called Promises from Proverbs.
[time=1452] This booklet is part of our study that we're doing most Sundays.
[time=1456] We're taking a break away from it today because it's Easter and we're going to study the resurrection.
[time=1461] But during this month of April, May we'll be looking at the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1465] This is a topical study of the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1468] You could look up things like finances or suffering or planning or the future and there you'll find all the Proverbs listed in order.
[time=1477] We'd love to send you a copy if you'll simply write to us.
[time=1480] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000.
[time=1485] Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1490] Once again, the address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000.
[time=1494] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1498] Thank you for watching with us today and we'd love to hear from you.
[time=1502] Just a card or a note is so important to us.
[time=1505] It lets us know that you're at the other end of all this camera, mileage of cable and all the equipment.
[time=1511] We'd love to hear from you. Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1514] If you don't have your Bible, would you get it right now so that we can study together confidence in the resurrection?
[time=1535] â™ª
[time=1547] I will not have words or tell our good deeds for not have I done
[time=1563] to merit his grace.
[time=1571] Our glory and praise shall rest upon him,
[time=1582] though willing to die in my place.
[time=1593] I will glory in the cross, in the cross, lest he suffer you, I'll be there.
[time=1615] I will weep no more for the cross that he bore.
[time=1626] I will glory in the cross.
[time=1637] My trophies and crown, my robe stained with sin.
[time=1648] It was all that I had to lay at his feet.
[time=1661] Unworthy to eat from the table of life until his love made provision for me.
[time=1682] I will glory in the cross, in the cross, lest his suffering, I'll be in vain.
[time=1703] I will weep no more for the cross that he bore.
[time=1714] I will glory in the cross.
[time=1724] I will weep no more for the cross that he bore.
[time=1735] I will glory in the cross.
[time=1763] Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=1771] The Apostle Paul said to the Church of Galatia, "God forbid that I should glory, except in
[time=1779] the cross of Jesus Christ, by whom I am crucified to the world, and the world is crucified to me."
[time=1789] God, today, there are so many things that we are often tempted to be proud of.
[time=1795] Things we've achieved and accomplished, we want to stake our claim against the wall of our own success.
[time=1802] God, you've reminded us today that we have nothing that lasts for eternity.
[time=1810] Our most noble accomplishment, our greatest achievement, will not last past the memory of this generation.
[time=1820] God, thank you that you've given us a vision of eternity, that we today know through your word that there is eternal life,
[time=1828] and we know that it's real because of the reality of the resurrection of Christ.
[time=1833] Father, today, we would want to know him.
[time=1836] We, through the stay of the Scriptures, would want you to teach us to plant within us a deep hope that he's alive,
[time=1843] and to give to our lives, as Paul said, the resurrection power.
[time=1848] Father, we pray that the power of the resurrected Christ would encourage those who've lost loved ones in recent days
[time=1855] to know that because Christ is alive, those who are in Christ shall also live.
[time=1860] We ask you to comfort today, fill us joy in the loss of your husband, Jim.
[time=1865] And for others who, today, sit here in this auditorium alone, one last Easter they sat next to the one they loved.
[time=1874] For those today who are at home listening by way of television, and they think often of that one they've loved who is gone, God, give us that confidence that they are with you, and we shall meet again in your kingdom.
[time=1891] Father, we would pray that your resurrection power would strengthen the hearts of those who've grown weary,
[time=1897] those who have battled against all kinds of pressure and odds to remain pure in their faith in Christ.
[time=1905] God, give them resurrection power.
[time=1908] Father, we pray for those who are battling for their health, that you would put within them that calm assurance that Jesus Christ is alive, and they shall ever be with him.
[time=1919] We pray for Don George today, that you'll strengthen his faith in the faith of his family.
[time=1925] Father, we pray today for those who are separated because of ill-feeling, not ill-health, but ill-feelings,
[time=1935] that you would heal and restore some damaged relationships.
[time=1940] Now, God, as we open your word, we open up our hearts to you.
[time=1944] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1949] When all of history comes to an end, one question will be paramount above every other.
[time=1956] That question is this.
[time=1959] Who moved that stone?
[time=1962] For you see, if that stone was moved by God himself to bring Jesus Christ back to life,
[time=1969] then all of history will culminate in him and will stand before him.
[time=1974] They hear him say, "Either well done, thou good and faithful servant, or perhaps to hear him say, "Depart from me.
[time=1985] I never knew you, if indeed God is the one that moved that stone."
[time=1993] But if that stone was moved by the disciples, or for some reason, the hostile religious leaders of that day, or even the Romans, then it won't matter at all.
[time=2007] History will just come to an end, and so will you and me.
[time=2012] The question is, who moved that stone?
[time=2017] If you have a Bible with you today, we encourage you to open it with us to the gospel according to Matthew.
[time=2023] That's the first book in the New Testament.
[time=2026] Matthew has 28 chapters.
[time=2029] The 27th chapter deals with the death of Christ and the 28th of the resurrection.
[time=2035] We're going to bridge both of those chapters this morning.
[time=2039] I'm going to begin by reading for you in verse 62 of Matthew chapter 27,
[time=2046] and read through into the 28th chapter and the 10th verse.
[time=2052] The next day, the one after preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate and said,
[time=2063] "Sir, we remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said,
[time=2070] after three days, I will rise again." So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.
[time=2081] Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body.
[time=2086] And tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.
[time=2089] This last deception would be worse than the first.
[time=2095] "Take a guard," Pilate answered.
[time=2099] "Go make the tomb as secure as you know how." So they went away and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone
[time=2110] and posting the guard.
[time=2114] After the Sabbath day, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
[time=2124] There was a violent earthquake.
[time=2126] For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[time=2136] His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
[time=2146] The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
[time=2155] The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
[time=2165] He is not here.
[time=2167] He has risen." Just as he said, "Come and see the place where he lay.
[time=2176] Then go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead
[time=2182] and is going ahead of you into Galilee.
[time=2185] There you will see him." Now I have told you.
[time=2191] This is the historical record of an eyewitness by the name of Matthew.
[time=2196] He is called Matthew in the New Testament.
[time=2198] He is also called Levi.
[time=2200] His account is very similar to those of Mark, another eyewitness, and John, a third eyewitness.
[time=2208] Luke was not there, but wrote from witness sources by staying close to Peter and other disciples.
[time=2214] Four different accounts all bringing to us the same facts that Jesus Christ died on the cross and that he rose again.
[time=2226] This story has been a story that has been perhaps more researched and investigated than any other single event in world history.
[time=2238] It has been researched and studied by those who were very, very sympathetic to the biblical account.
[time=2245] As well, it has been addressed by those who were very hostile.
[time=2248] By men who said, "Our purpose is to investigate the historical evidence and to show that the resurrection of Christ did not occur that it is nothing more than mythology." I like stories of Paul Bunyan in his Blue Ox babe.
[time=2265] I mean, do you really believe there was a man by the name of Paul Bunyan who chopped down trees and he had a Blue Ox?
[time=2271] I mean, do you really believe that?
[time=2274] A mythology, just another story, or a story a lot like the stories of the Romans and the Greek and their mythology.
[time=2282] They're characters like Hercules.
[time=2285] Do you really believe there was a Hercules?
[time=2288] Do you really believe there was a Jesus that rose again?
[time=2291] Some would say no, just mythology.
[time=2293] And in fact, they would make it their life's purpose to disprove this.
[time=2297] In the years 1600s into the early 1700s, two men embarked on such an investigation.
[time=2303] British men, George Littleton, and Sir Gilbert West.
[time=2307] Each of them took independent studies and were researching, coming together to pull their findings, to prove this is all mythology.
[time=2316] At the end of their independent studies, they each met almost afraid to encounter the other because each of them had come to the opposite conclusion of their original theses.
[time=2330] They postulated that this was not history.
[time=2333] Now, having investigated, they say that it is.
[time=2337] And to each other's surprise, they both independently become believers.
[time=2343] About two generations ago lived another man.
[time=2346] An Englishman also of nobility by the name of Sir William Ramsey.
[time=2350] He was an archeologist and a very accomplished one at that.
[time=2354] He set out with shovel and pick and hand to do the mission of the Middle East to show why the historicity of Luke's Matthew's marks, John's word, could not be substantiated.
[time=2366] She'd all be dismissed.
[time=2369] And as he completed his study, he completed his faith in Christ and became a believer.
[time=2375] Just a generation ago, a playwright, a man wanting to write a novel, a book.
[time=2381] Not to show Jesus Christ as God, but to show him as a mere man, Paul Wallace began doing the research that any good writer would do.
[time=2390] And in the course of his own study had to change the title of his book
[time=2396] and the very theme.
[time=2398] For he no longer believed Jesus to be a mere man, but to believe that he was actually God.
[time=2404] The new title of the book was Ben Hur, an epic classic showing faith in Christ as a reality.
[time=2411] Another man also trying to disprove the resurrection.
[time=2415] Frank Morrison.
[time=2417] In Morrison's study, trying to disprove this whole event, he came to the conclusion, like Sir Gilbert West, like George Littleton, like Sir William Ramsey, like Lou Wallace that Christ indeed rose again, and he titled his book Who Moved the Stone.
[time=2434] He approached it like a lawyer, and he suggests, first of all, that we look at the material evidence.
[time=2439] Let's do that.
[time=2440] There are at least these five pieces of material evidence.
[time=2444] The first material evidence that's referenced in the Bible was the body of Christ himself.
[time=2450] If you follow detective shows, before you can accuse somebody of murder, you have to have a body.
[time=2456] And so we discover that as we read the Gospels, Jesus Christ was pronounced dead.
[time=2462] As a matter of fact, he was pronounced dead repeatedly.
[time=2465] Each of the Gospel accounts tell us that Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross and he hung there until he was dead.
[time=2473] But not only was there the confirmation of those records, if you'll recall, a spear was taken and it was thrust into Jesus' side and out poured a mixture of both blood and water.
[time=2485] What that exactly means is really uncertain.
[time=2489] Many medical doctors believe that that spear penetrated through the chest cavity into what's called the pericardium, the outer layer protecting the heart that is filled with fluids and the rupture actually went to the heart, which would have killed him had he been a healthy man fully alive.
[time=2509] And there was a third confirmation that Jesus was dead.
[time=2513] Joseph of Arimathea came to Pilate requesting the body of Jesus.
[time=2517] And Pilate said, "Well, it's too early. He can't be dead yet." You see, crucifixion is designed to be a slow, agonizing process.
[time=2527] It meant that a man would hang there until his joints would fall out apart and he could no longer lift himself up to breathe and he would suffocate by his own weight.
[time=2537] It often took a day or several days.
[time=2542] But Jesus was crucified somewhere right around noon.
[time=2547] And at three o'clock they said he was dead.
[time=2550] Joseph says, "May I take the body?" And Pilate says, "Is he already dead?" And he sends and he inquires of the centurion who was the chief executioner, the man who was responsible for killing thousands.
[time=2565] He was a professional executor.
[time=2567] He knew when people were dead and when they weren't.
[time=2570] And it's confirmed again Jesus is dead.
[time=2573] That's the first piece of material evidence.
[time=2575] Here's the second piece of material evidence.
[time=2577] It's this tomb in stone, not this one, but one that this represents.
[time=2583] The tomb that Jesus was buried in was a very typical tomb for Jerusalem.
[time=2588] Right into the side of a mountain they would chisel and carve and chisel and carve until they carved right into the hard rock rather than just a little grave spot, an actual room-like.
[time=2600] And off of this would be several births, if you will, where several people could be buried for multiple burials.
[time=2609] Then over that stone tomb would be rolled a huge stone, perhaps this size more likely even larger.
[time=2618] The purpose of that stone was to protect the bodies from both animals and from men.
[time=2627] The Hebrews were not like the Egyptians that they buried their dead with enormous treasures, but often people would be buried with some valuables, rings, jewelry and other things.
[time=2638] That would be worth the stealing if you were of a mind to do it.
[time=2641] A huge stone was employed, one that not one or two men were going to move but one that would take a company of men to move.
[time=2651] Jesus' body is in-tuned and rock like that, sealed with a stone like that.
[time=2658] The stone was so large that the next morning the women wanted to go and prepare Jesus' body further, which meant they wanted to treat it with spices and oil, but they said, "We can't." Three women said, "Who's going to move the stone away?" It was inconceivable for them to even think of moving it.
[time=2676] It was so large.
[time=2678] Well, there's a third piece of material evidence.
[time=2680] That's the seal.
[time=2681] Now, when you and I hear the word seal, we think of something like superglue.
[time=2685] You know, did they come and they cock all the way around that stone with superglue and say, "Aha!
[time=2689] No one's going to get in there now." No, that wasn't it.
[time=2693] Probably it was something like this.
[time=2696] Some adhesive-like clay, not very strong, but something that was stick was put right here with a leather strap in it.
[time=2704] Leather strap was pulled across to this point.
[time=2707] And another piece of adhesive-like clay is put there.
[time=2711] Hey, so that isn't going to hold anything.
[time=2713] You're right.
[time=2714] But then what they would do is they would take some type of insignia.
[time=2717] Maybe a ring and they would press it right into the clay.
[time=2720] And the only way you could move that stone would be to pull off that leather strap.
[time=2726] And when you did that, it would break that clay, and it would break that seal.
[time=2731] And that seal said, in not these words, no trespassing by order of the emperor.
[time=2739] And you knew that if you were going to tamper with that seal, you were tampering with the Roman Empire.
[time=2745] And few were likely to do that.
[time=2748] Do you ever notice how there's no trespassing signs around and you're tempted to, oh, maybe just cut through the yard or something?
[time=2755] But you may find a house that's abandoned in it.
[time=2758] It has a no trespassing sign on it.
[time=2760] But underneath it, it says no trespassing by order of the FBI.
[time=2764] Doesn't that give you a different feeling about trespassing?
[time=2767] Just those big letters, FBI.
[time=2770] That's basically what that said.
[time=2772] No trespassing, Roman Empire.
[time=2775] People didn't mess with that.
[time=2778] The next piece of material evidence would be the guards.
[time=2782] They came.
[time=2783] They said, "We remember when this man was alive." He said he would rise again.
[time=2788] "Let's secure it." And Pilate said, "Take a guard." How many guards there were?
[time=2794] We don't know, but there were a minimum of four, because that was the smallest detachment of a guard the Romans would send.
[time=2801] So there is this huge stone.
[time=2804] The body's entombed.
[time=2806] The seal's in place.
[time=2807] Now we've got four guards.
[time=2809] To be honest, probably one of them is on duty and the other are somewhat at leisure.
[time=2814] These four guards are positioned around the face of the tomb.
[time=2817] Then the final piece of material evidence would be what we call the grave clothes.
[time=2823] Jesus was wrapped, not mummified, again like the Egyptians, but his body would be wrapped in clothing that was probably dipped in a sticky, oily substance made of different spices that would both slow down the process of decay, but would also add a pleasant aroma.
[time=2845] John tells us that when they went into the tomb, they saw where the body was because the grave clothes were laying in place, undisturbed, but the body's gone.
[time=2857] Now with those five pieces of material evidence, we have the body, the tomb and stone, the seal, the guards, and the grave clothes.
[time=2867] We set side by side with them the eyewitnesses.
[time=2870] Here is just a partial list of the eyewitnesses.
[time=2874] First of all, Jesus was seen by the women who came to the tomb.
[time=2877] Then he was seen by two men, as they were walking to a different city called Emmaus.
[time=2884] Then he was seen of ten of the disciples.
[time=2887] Judas is dead, Thomas is absent.
[time=2889] Thomas comes back and says, I don't know what's wrong with you guys, but you're seeing things.
[time=2894] I'll never believe until I see Jesus appears and he said I see.
[time=2901] Now I believe.
[time=2903] Then there's another appearance to the eleven in Galilee.
[time=2907] Then there's an appearance that Paul records in 1 Corinthians 15, the five hundred people at one time.
[time=2915] Now with that material evidence and that eyewitness evidence,
[time=2923] we have to investigate why it could possibly have happened on this occurrence.
[time=2929] It's important for us to note though, even before we begin the study, that Jesus repeatedly announced before his death that he would rise again.
[time=2942] Let me tell you why that's important.
[time=2944] First of all, it's important because the Jewish hostile audience, not all the Jews were hostile, more loved him.
[time=2951] But the ones who were hostile said to him, hey, all these things you're saying, you're claiming to be the Messiah, you're claiming to be God, what proof do you have?
[time=2962] Jesus had already walked on water, turned other water into wine, healed the sick, and he had taken their money that they desperately needed and caused a fish to swim to shore.
[time=2975] Can any of you cause a fish to swim to shore?
[time=2978] I've heard some fishing stories, but I haven't heard that one yet.
[time=2981] And the fish opens up its mouth and there's a coin.
[time=2985] Wouldn't you love to pay your taxes like that today?
[time=2988] Sorry, Governor, I meant the pay, the fish didn't come in.
[time=2991] I don't know that that one will fly down at the state capitol.
[time=2994] But Jesus did that miraculously.
[time=2996] They said, no, you've never given us a sign.
[time=2998] He'd given them multiple signs, but he said this.
[time=3000] You want a sign?
[time=3002] Here it is.
[time=3004] Destroy this temple, and in three days, I'll bring it up again.
[time=3009] They didn't understand it, they thought he meant the temple, the building.
[time=3013] But as we read earlier, once Jesus was dead, they remembered what he said.
[time=3018] It was the sign they asked for.
[time=3020] Secondly, him announcing it ahead of time was important because as we read the Old Testament, there's a prophecy about the Messiah that doesn't make sense without the resurrection.
[time=3031] It's Psalms, chapter 16, verse 10, where it says, "You will not abandon me in the grave, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption." That doesn't make sense.
[time=3042] How can somebody be in the grave but not be abandoned?
[time=3044] How can they be in the grave and not corrupt?
[time=3047] Resurrection.
[time=3049] And that's picked up by Peter in his first message.
[time=3052] But it's also important because by Jesus announcing it ahead of time, he set his enemies up.
[time=3059] He set them up, they remembered it, and they made all the assurances that they could to stop the resurrection.
[time=3066] That way it didn't happen in some quiet Judean village that nobody knew about, and they came back and said, "All he arose." It's happening downtown Jerusalem with Roman guards and a Roman seal there.
[time=3077] The guarantee it doesn't happen.
[time=3080] Now, what are the possible interpretations of all the evidence that's been collected for us?
[time=3087] Well, here are the possible views.
[time=3089] View number one is that the disciples stole the body.
[time=3094] As a matter of fact, that's what Caiaphas wants you and I to believe.
[time=3098] When the guards came to Caiaphas and said, "We've got a problem."
[time=3104] Jesus arose, Caiaphas says, "No, wait a minute." What you do, you take this money, it's called a bribe, and you say you fell asleep.
[time=3117] While you were asleep, you say the disciples came and stole the body, and then Caiaphas offers and will square things with Pilate.
[time=3126] Now, that's important to remember.
[time=3128] Why did he need to square things with Pilate?
[time=3130] Well, you see, if you're the Roman guard, and it's your job to guard this tomb
[time=3136] so that that dead body stays in there, if that dead body doesn't stay in there,
[time=3142] Rome says, "We've got a new body we're going to put in there, yours."
[time=3148] These four guards had a very vested interest in making sure the original body stayed there because that tomb was going to be occupied.
[time=3157] And that's what Caiaphas wanted everybody to believe that the disciples stole the body.
[time=3163] Well, let's review that for just a moment.
[time=3166] First of all, everything we know about the disciples tells us they were incapable of that.
[time=3173] These men were at best running cowards.
[time=3178] Peter was confronted and Peter said, "Jesus, I've heard that name, Jesus."
[time=3184] Never met him, Galilee, never been there.
[time=3188] Nazareth don't know where it is. He denied Christ and he ran.
[time=3193] As did all of the disciples other than John who stood off at a distance, dismade, confused.
[time=3202] The next time we meet them, Christ is dead and they're literally hiding in the upper room.
[time=3209] If the disciples were that fearful, there is no reason on earth to believe
[time=3215] that suddenly they got an idea. Well, let's go down.
[time=3218] Let's beat up these Roman guards. Let's risk our lives.
[time=3221] Let's steal the body. Let's hide it. Let's go back into the temple.
[time=3225] Tell everybody he's alive.
[time=3227] Now, even if you believe that, then what you have to say is now the Romans and the high priest are after the disciples.
[time=3235] They're imprisoning them. They're beating them.
[time=3238] For saying Jesus Christ is alive and we're saying that the disciples chose to die to defend a lie.
[time=3246] That just doesn't hold any water. People don't rarely die for the truth.
[time=3251] They never die for a lie. Not only that.
[time=3255] We have post-resurrection appearances of Christ, not just to those eleven men, but the five hundred people.
[time=3264] Not only that, if the disciples had indeed stolen the body,
[time=3270] the Romans and the guard of the high priest were more than capable of shutting up these ten men.
[time=3277] They crucified and executed hundreds of people on a given day.
[time=3283] They could have stopped that story.
[time=3286] The theory that the disciples stole the body, the Passover plot, really doesn't stack up very well against the evidence.
[time=3294] Well, there's a second theory. That is that the Romans are the Jewish leaders stole the body.
[time=3302] That one makes less logic.
[time=3305] First of all, they were the ones guarding the body.
[time=3308] Why would they then turn around and steal the body?
[time=3311] Secondly, once the disciples announced the resurrection, if they stole the body, all they had to do is say, "Gotcha.
[time=3317] Come over here, open up the local morgue and say, "There's the body of Jesus. It is as dead as dead can be.
[time=3324] He is not alive. That would have ended Christianity in a moment." No, that wouldn't work.
[time=3330] And once again, we have those five hundred witnesses.
[time=3333] Well, here's a more popular view. It's called the Swoon Theory.
[time=3336] Swoon Theory says Jesus was indeed nailed to the cross.
[time=3340] It looked like he was dead. Everybody thought he was dead, but he wasn't quite dead.
[time=3345] And you took this near dead body, moved it over here, you placed it in this tomb, and now this tomb is kind of cool.
[time=3351] It's kind of damp.
[time=3353] And the theory says, "And that was therapeutic." And Jesus, after being in there three days and three nights, was refreshed.
[time=3363] And he got up. He, with his hands that had been pierced, rolled back the stone that three women couldn't roll back.
[time=3375] He rolled that back by himself, came out, either snuck by four Roman guards who were guarding his life with their life or overpowered them.
[time=3385] Then on these feet that were nailed pierced, he walked seven miles on a dusty road to Emmaus,
[time=3391] then brought this beleaguered body to his disciples and said, "I've risen from the dead."
[time=3397] And they were so inspired that they turned the world upside down.
[time=3402] It doesn't make any sense medically. It's impossible.
[time=3406] It doesn't make any sense psychologically, and it doesn't make any sense historically.
[time=3412] Well, there's another view. It's called the hallucination view.
[time=3415] It said that indeed there was an earthquake in a thunderstorm that day, and Mary and the other women came walking down,
[time=3423] and what they saw was thunder and lightning, and they thought it was an angel, and they hallucinated, they thought they were all Jesus.
[time=3429] They were so scared.
[time=3431] What you have to assume is that all of the women had the same hallucination.
[time=3437] That defies every law of psychology.
[time=3440] A hallucination is always a personal esoteric experience that is never shared by another person.
[time=3446] But not only do you have to have all these women having the same hallucination, you've got to get Peter and John to run to the tomb and have the same hallucination.
[time=3453] Then there have to be two men on the road to Emmaus who have the same hallucination.
[time=3457] Then you have all ten of the disciples having the same hallucination.
[time=3464] Then you have five hundred people having the same hallucination, and that's no longer a hallucination.
[time=3470] If five hundred people saw the same thing, it's real.
[time=3474] Well, there's one final possible view, and that view is this, that Jesus Christ died on a cross like this.
[time=3486] He was buried in a tomb like this, and by the power of God, he was raised back to life, proving he was God.
[time=3508] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our sanctuary choir, the men singers, and the handbell choir, and our soloist Marilyn Wong.
[time=3516] The message today was a direct reflection on the fact that we believe that Jesus Christ indeed rose again from the dead for our sins.
[time=3525] If you've made a decision today concerning your spiritual walk with God, but you take a moment and pray this prayer with me, let's bow together.
[time=3533] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3541] Today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3544] I ask you to come in and to forgive me of my sins. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3552] If you made a decision concerning your walk with Jesus Christ, would you write us today and tell us the nature of your decision?
