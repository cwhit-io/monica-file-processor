[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] (bell ringing) - Today is Groundbreaking Sunday
[time=113] here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=115] As soon as this service is over, we're going across the street for a ceremony of dedication, praying that God would build his church here at Black Hawk.
[time=126] We're looking forward to that.
[time=128] Building churches has always been somewhat of a difficult and occasionally comical problem.
[time=134] One church building committee made the following decisions.
[time=138] One, we're going to build a new church.
[time=141] Two, we're going to build the new church on the site of our existing church.
[time=146] Three, we're going to try to use some of the materials from our existing church in the new building.
[time=153] And four, we're going to use our present facilities until the new church is built.
[time=160] Occasionally we make such foolish mistakes.
[time=163] One of the biggest mistakes we often make is to think that church building is actually building a building.
[time=170] Church building, when Christ said, "Well, build my church," is building lives.
[time=177] (dramatic music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=191] Thank you for joining us.
[time=193] Rick's message today is taken from Matthew chapter 16 and is entitled, "Upon This Rock." The Lord promised that he would build his church.
[time=203] He spoke of building, a foundation, and keys.
[time=207] No doubt, he envisioned actual physical buildings.
[time=210] But he usually spoke of the church as his people.
[time=214] Building actually occurs when we love people to faith in Christ and when we build up their faith in Him.
[time=221] Physical buildings are only tools to help in the work of building lives, the real church.
[time=226] As we break ground for our new sanctuary today, the Lord's emphasis and our emphasis is on people.
[time=233] We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study with us.
[time=237] We will be looking at Matthew chapter 16 verses 13 through 20.
[time=242] The sanctuary choir will be bringing us a message in song.
[time=245] Other special music today will be provided by a group from Black Hawk Christian School called Mirror.
[time=252] Rejoice.
[time=257] And Kathy Hawks.
[time=259] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=270] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=273] Now here's Rick.
[time=276] - A particular Sunday, but especially today as we are planning the groundbreaking of our brand new sanctuary.
[time=283] One of the most important things we can remember is that when Christ said, "I will build my church." He wasn't talking about this building, the new building or any other building.
[time=293] He was talking about our lives.
[time=296] And today we look forward to a new facility that will allow us to reach more lives for Christ.
[time=301] We're delighted that you're here today to worship with us and also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=310] Our choir is going to lead us in a song that speaks of the fact that Jesus Christ said, "Upon this rock, I will build my church." I've always wanted to be a part of a choir.
[time=320] Neither Pete nor any of our other ministers of music quite saw it that way.
[time=325] But today I get to be a part of the choir, "So Do You." Take your hymn books and turn to hymn number 22.
[time=331] And as the choir sings about halfway through the song, Peter is gonna turn and lead us and we're gonna join them in singing of the choir and the congregation together about the fact that Christ promised that he would build his church.
[time=345] Verses one through five when Peter directs us.
[time=348] (upbeat music)
[time=354] [MUSIC - 282 seconds]
[time=641] - What a glorious prospect to reign with our Lord someday.
[time=650] Let's continue our worship together as we sing 327.
[time=654] We'll sing the first, second, fourth, and fifth stanzas of I love thy kingdom, Lord, hymn number 327.
[time=663] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=755] - Thank you again for your good singing.
[time=762] We appreciate that very much.
[time=765] Throughout the month of April, we've been highlighting students and faculty and staff from Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=771] We're delighted with us, to have with us today and ensemble.
[time=775] They're called mirror.
[time=776] They're directed by Emily Pippen.
[time=778] Let's listen to them now as they minister to us talking about the treasure that we store up.
[time=783] Where that treasure is, our heart is there also.
[time=786] Mirror.
[time=787] (piano music) [MUSIC - 165 seconds]
[time=960] - Hello again, and thank you for joining us today
[time=972] for the Bible Hour.
[time=973] We are so excited on this special day that God has given us the opportunity of building a new sanctuary.
[time=980] And as soon as this service is over, we're going across the street for groundbreaking.
[time=985] But not only is this groundbreaking Sunday, this is the month of April and we're emphasizing Christian education.
[time=991] So joining Pete and me today is the elementary coordinator and our fifth grade teacher, Aida Tofolo.
[time=999] Aida, thanks for joining us here on the insert of the Bible Hour.
[time=1002] You've been a part of our school since the very beginning, haven't you?
[time=1005] - That's exactly right, Rick.
[time=1006] That's been 14 years ago.
[time=1008] - Wow, that's exciting that you had the hand in getting it started.
[time=1012] And 14 years later, it's going strong.
[time=1014] What would you say as your length of time here gives you a better perspective than mine has been one of the key reasons for the success of our school?
[time=1024] - Well, Rick, I would have to say that probably the emphasis on the word of God in our school has been the one thread that has just been the most meaningful all through these past 14 years.
[time=1034] We memorize the scripture, of course, but even apart from that, it's the fact that kids can apply the word of God in their lives.
[time=1043] And we see that happening almost every day in our school.
[time=1046] And that's just a thrilling thing.
[time=1048] And I know this that God promises that His word will never depart from us.
[time=1053] And I just know that these kids will carry the word of God with them wherever they are throughout their whole lives.
[time=1059] - And that's just exciting to me.
[time=1061] - Oh, it is to me too.
[time=1062] I have the privilege of having two little girls under your care as the elementary coordinator.
[time=1067] They're learning math, they're learning to read and to write, extremely good program, but that value of the word of God is absolutely critical.
[time=1077] What recently has been some of the highlights of our school calendar and the things that are happening amongst the students?
[time=1083] - I just want to share with you something that we did for the first time a couple of weeks ago in the elementary school.
[time=1089] And that was we had a praise the kids week.
[time=1091] You know, so often in school, the thing that teachers do is don't do this, don't do that, you're in trouble here.
[time=1100] And I just decided that our kids are so special.
[time=1104] And I guess maybe the Lord had just reminded me of all the neat things that they do.
[time=1108] So I talked with our teachers and I said, let's have a time that we can get together and let's use that time to really praise the kids.
[time=1116] So we met two or three times that week in assembly with the upper grade kids and with the lower grade kids.
[time=1122] And the teacher shared with the kids all the neat things that they've been doing, how they've helped one another, how we've observed as far as there being kind to one another, something happened just recently with one of our teachers as she was making a phone call to plan for an end of the year picnic.
[time=1142] And she happened to call back to a place that we had taken three of our classes last year.
[time=1146] And as soon as she told the person in charge who she was and the school, that person immediately said, oh, those kids were the greatest kids we had all summer.
[time=1158] And I mean, this is a big place in Fort Wayne and they have hundreds and thousands of kids that come there probably from the month of May clear through to September.
[time=1167] And that response was just so voluntary.
[time=1171] And again, we were reminded these are our kids and we're so proud of them.
[time=1175] Then we did a neat thing, we gave the kids an opportunity to share with one another some of the things that their friends had done to them or for them that was an encouraging thing.
[time=1187] And I tell you, you know, it doesn't take long for me to be moved to tears.
[time=1191] But some of those six graders, some of those boys that were willing to stand up and just share with their friends and say, boy, you know, this person encouraged me.
[time=1202] This happened to me and somebody came up and said, are you okay?
[time=1205] That was such a neat experience for us to hear our kids sharing with one another.
[time=1210] That was really special.
[time=1211] Boy, that is neat.
[time=1212] You know, we hear so much about negative peer pressure but we've got some positive peer pressure going and then that whole service was just biblical that we encouraged one another.
[time=1222] Well, a little bit about the future.
[time=1223] What's the future hold for Black Hawk Christian School?
[time=1226] Well, when we talk about the future, I always get excited because I just remember that being a part of the school, when we first started and starting out with 33 kids and then now looking at well over 300 kids in our school, having about four or five classes that are closed with waiting lists and anticipating that we're going to be really pretty close to capacity come fall.
[time=1251] That's exciting to me.
[time=1253] And then the other day, we were talking about double tracking in our school.
[time=1257] I tell you, I didn't think I'd ever see the day that we didn't have to even think about that.
[time=1261] So those are some of the things that we're anticipating in the future.
[time=1264] Well, thank you.
[time=1265] Not only for coming and sharing your heart today but for the investment in your time and the lives of our children.
[time=1272] I really appreciate that.
[time=1273] Thanks, Rick.
[time=1274] If you're interested in Christian education and Black Hawk Christian School, I want to encourage you to either write to us and we'll give the address in a few moments or to call the church office Monday through Friday.
[time=1286] Our phone number if you're here in Fort Wayne is a local call.
[time=1290] It is 749-8524.
[time=1294] And we'd love to have your letter or your phone call and we'll give you more information about the school.
[time=1299] Again, the phone number 749-8524.
[time=1305] Pete, tonight our youth have a special service for us.
[time=1308] Yes, Rick, I've been sitting here not saying much but just saying amen in my heart to all the things that are happening in the Christian School because that directly impacts on our kids here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1321] And tonight under the direction of Renee Longbrake and Ron Hackett, the young people are presenting a musical entitled "Run the Race." That's at 6 p.m. here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1332] Certainly is a very enjoyable time to see these young people relate their Christian life to running the race of life.
[time=1339] It's gonna be an exciting time, Rick, and it'll be encouraging to see these young people.
[time=1343] And I know Aida knows many of them from the younger grades and now as high school juniors and seniors presenting this and still serving God in this way.
[time=1352] - Oh, I'm looking forward to it.
[time=1354] Again, today is groundbreaking Sunday and about 12, 15 will be across the street breaking ground for our new sanctuary.
[time=1361] If you live close by, we certainly wanna invite you to come.
[time=1365] Before we go, we have one booklet we'd like to share with you.
[time=1368] It's a booklet entitled "Promises from Proverbs." It's a topical study of the book of Proverbs so that you can look up the table of contents, some key subjects like contentment, or friendship, or finances, and there have the treasury of God's word and insight.
[time=1384] We'd love to send you a copy if you'll simply write to us today.
[time=1388] Our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1398] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, we hope that the music and the challenge from God's word builds up your life and the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=1408] [MUSIC - 274 seconds]
[time=1690] Blackout Christian School is special to me
[time=1708] because it consistently challenges me to live every aspect of my life for the of Christ.
[time=1713] It provides me with an atmosphere in which I can see true Christianity at work in both the lives of the students and the teachers.
[time=1720] BCS has been an important part in my own spiritual growth.
[time=1724] It has not only developed my mind academically but spiritually.
[time=1727] Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it.
[time=1732] BCS has educated me with the tools I need to be a light for Christ in a lost world.
[time=1737] As I take a new step in life now, I only pray that I will properly put those tools to work.
[time=1742] Blackout Christian is very important to me because of the friends I have made here.
[time=1748] I feel that the friends I have made will be lifelong friends.
[time=1751] I know I could go to any one of them at any time and talk with them about a problem that I have.
[time=1757] It is a school where we can learn about God.
[time=1762] We learn all the normal subjects but they are centered around God.
[time=1766] Blackhawk is an extension of my home.
[time=1768] The values that my parents teach me are reinforced.
[time=1771] I have developed many meaningful friendships at BCS.
[time=1774] Not only with the students and teachers but more so with God.
[time=1779] There are lots of things that are special to me about Blackhawk but probably the most important thing is the way the teachers and coaches really care about us and that we are able to go to them with any problems.
[time=1790] The coaches are great examples to teach us to have good Christian attitudes which can be a witness to other teams we play.
[time=1797] I like our school because you don't have to dress a certain way.
[time=1801] You don't have to act a certain way and you don't have to be somebody or not.
[time=1805] You won't be afraid to tell people you are a Christian.
[time=1808] You won't be pressured to do something you know is wrong.
[time=1810] Blackhawk is a lot different from the other schools.
[time=1813] It's like we are one big family and the Lord.
[time=1815] The teachers put aside their own things for us kids.
[time=1818] They are not just our teachers, they are our friends and they are there for us whenever we need them.
[time=1823] I am thankful for our school because it is a Christian school and it has Christian teachers in it.
[time=1829] I am so glad because it's not a public school and doesn't teach evolution.
[time=1833] I don't know how I would feel if I went to a public school because I've gone to Blackhawk for so long and I have come to like it.
[time=1840] Every time I hear something about public schools it makes me think about evolution and why people believe and teach it.
[time=1847] Everyone should thank God for Christianity because it's an important part of life and an important part of the church.
[time=1854] I like Jim. We have nice teachers and recess.
[time=1860] The people are different. They are Christians.
[time=1862] I wouldn't like it if the people weren't Christians because they would be nasty and they would hurt you.
[time=1868] I like my teachers at Blackhawk Christian school.
[time=1872] We learn songs, games and do papers.
[time=1875] It is a Christian school which means we love Jesus and we pray to him at another school and not pray to Jesus.
[time=1884] Him at another school.
[time=1890] I want to say thank you boys and girls but some of them are men and women.
[time=1898] These are representative students from the kindergarten all the way to the senior year of high school representatives of our school.
[time=1905] I can relate best to the little guy who liked recess and Jim. Those were my two favorite subjects.
[time=1911] I could throw in lunch. Those would be my three favorite subjects.
[time=1914] Thank you for representing our school so well.
[time=1917] Would you all pray with me?
[time=1919] God, we are thankful today for our school.
[time=1922] In the unique opportunity it affords to our students to learn the excellence of academics but to do that on a biblical foundation.
[time=1932] We pray that as they are trained and equipped that you would make of them unique servants for Christ in this community.
[time=1940] We pray for those people in our church who teach in the public schools that you would make them alike in that community.
[time=1947] Sharing Christ in a gracious and yet discreet way.
[time=1950] We pray for our students at Snyder and other schools that you would give them a testimony and an impact for Christ in those places.
[time=1959] Father, we pray for our church that you would make it strong spiritually.
[time=1963] That you would build us into maturity in Christ.
[time=1967] Father, we would pray today that you would comfort those who have lost loved ones in recent days. The Devo family.
[time=1974] The family of Don George, the family of Jim Joy.
[time=1978] We pray for those who are ill, for Gertrude Geller, and also for Jane Vanderfort, that your comfort would be upon them.
[time=1987] Father, we are thankful that your son Jesus promised that he would meet with us today and we do meet him the name of the Lord Jesus and ask him to be present and to take this common ordinary ground and transform it into holy ground, making it a place where the Lord is honored.
[time=2006] God, thank you today that we have the promise that you would live in us and make our very steps to walk on holy ground.
[time=2016] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2022] [MUSIC] As I walked through the door [MUSIC] I sensed his presence [MUSIC] And I knew this was the place where [MUSIC] Love abounds [MUSIC] For this is the temple [MUSIC] Jehovah God [MUSIC] God abides here [MUSIC] And we are standing in his presence [MUSIC] On holy ground [MUSIC] We are standing on holy ground [MUSIC] And I know there are angels [MUSIC] All around [MUSIC] Let us pray [MUSIC] Jesus know [MUSIC] We are standing in his presence [MUSIC] On holy ground [MUSIC] In his presence [MUSIC] There is joy beyond a measure [MUSIC] And that his feet peace of mind [MUSIC] Can still be found [MUSIC] If you have a need [MUSIC] I know he has the answer [MUSIC] Reach out and claim it [MUSIC] Child you are standing on holy ground [MUSIC] And we are standing on holy ground [MUSIC] And I know there are angels [MUSIC] All around [MUSIC] Let us pray [MUSIC] Jesus know [MUSIC] We are standing in his presence [MUSIC] On holy ground [MUSIC] We are standing on holy ground [MUSIC] And I know there are angels [MUSIC] All around [MUSIC] Let us pray [MUSIC] Jesus know [MUSIC] We are standing in his presence [MUSIC] We are standing in his presence [MUSIC] We are standing in his presence [MUSIC] On holy ground [MUSIC] Holy ground ♪
[time=2312] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2323] The very promise of Christ that he would come into our life, unworthy as we are, transform it, walk with it, and by his presence make wherever we are holy ground.
[time=2336] We endeavor to build a new building.
[time=2338] That building won't be holy because it's a sanctuary and this is a gym, a place as unique based upon the presence of the Spirit of God.
[time=2348] And we hope that you know him in the depth of your heart, holy ground.
[time=2354] Well, churches build buildings.
[time=2356] They're important and they're good.
[time=2358] They go through some tough, tough times making decisions as to how to build the building, where to put it, what materials to use.
[time=2366] Sometimes those decisions don't always make the best sense.
[time=2370] One church decided that they were one, going to build a brand new church.
[time=2376] Two, they would build it on the exact same spot where the old church existed.
[time=2381] Three, they would build the new building using a lot of the materials out of the existing church.
[time=2387] And four, they'd meet in the existing church until the new building was built.
[time=2392] They're going to have a tough time doing all that.
[time=2395] They make a lot of mistakes in planning for buildings.
[time=2399] One of the biggest mistakes we make is to think that when Jesus said, "I will build my church," that he was talking about buildings.
[time=2408] He was talking about people.
[time=2410] Let's look at those words of Christ.
[time=2412] "I will build my church." They're found in Matthew chapter 16.
[time=2417] And I would like to read for us verses 13 through 20.
[time=2421] I have what's called a new international version.
[time=2425] So if yours reads a little different, I think you'll still be able to understand the context.
[time=2430] Matthew 16 verse 13.
[time=2433] When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
[time=2445] They replied.
[time=2447] Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others, Jeremiah are one of the prophets.
[time=2460] "But what about you?" he asked.
[time=2464] "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2470] Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus replied.
[time=2480] "Blessed are you, Simon.
[time=2482] Son of Jonah.
[time=2483] For this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.
[time=2489] And I tell you that you are Peter.
[time=2492] And upon this rock, I will build my church.
[time=2497] And the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
[time=2502] I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2505] And whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven.
[time=2514] Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
[time=2522] Matthew begins by giving us even a little bit of geography for background.
[time=2528] He says that they're at the point called Caesarea Philippi.
[time=2533] Now I'm going to draw you a quick map of Israel.
[time=2535] Down here is a big sea called the Dead Sea, so much salt in it and there's not much life, Dead Sea.
[time=2543] It is filled by a river that's flowing from the north called the Jordan.
[time=2547] And towards the top of the Jordan is the Sea of Galilee.
[time=2550] But then the Jordan continues a little further to a mountain called Mount Herman.
[time=2556] Mount Herman is a tall, dominating scene.
[time=2560] Rock, ledges, cliffs, massive boulders.
[time=2564] And about 1,500 feet up on one of these massive rock cliffs is a city called Caesarea, which stands for the city of Caesar.
[time=2573] It's distinguished from another city of the same name with the second name Philippi.
[time=2579] It's the city that Philip the Tetrarch refurbished and helped to build.
[time=2584] Now to be clear, the whole point is that Jesus is at the other end of Israel.
[time=2590] What's he doing up there?
[time=2592] I think there are two reasons.
[time=2594] First of all, Jesus has done a multitude of miracles.
[time=2597] And the more miracles he does, the more people come and follow him.
[time=2601] To the point there are 5,000 people there right at dinner time.
[time=2606] Isn't that when your friends show up to?
[time=2608] Here they come by the masses.
[time=2611] And so he feeds them.
[time=2612] A few days later, they show up again and he feeds them again.
[time=2617] And all of Jesus' friends are beginning to overwhelm him.
[time=2621] At the same time as his popularity is growing, the opposition is mounting.
[time=2627] And he is literally getting the squeeze from both sides, those that like him and those that don't like him.
[time=2632] And really what Jesus and his disciples did is they went on the first men's retreat.
[time=2636] Jesus said, "I'm getting out of here." And he went as far away as he could and still stay in Israel.
[time=2642] It's a very northern boundaries.
[time=2645] So one reason why he's up there in Caesarea Philippi is because he's trying to get away from it all.
[time=2652] The second reason is Jesus being God knows what he wants to teach.
[time=2657] He's going to teach a lesson about a foundation, about a rock.
[time=2662] And what a better place to do it than beneath the tallest rock mountain and a city built on the ledge.
[time=2669] And he wanted them to see it as well as to hear it.
[time=2674] Now, they're on a men's retreat.
[time=2677] They're at a winter getaway from it all spot.
[time=2679] The disciples are there and Jesus begins to have a reflective conversation.
[time=2684] And he asked them a rather non-threatening question.
[time=2687] It was this one.
[time=2689] Who do men say that I am?
[time=2693] He's using the George Gallup method, a poll.
[time=2696] All right, you guys, tell me what's the word on this street?
[time=2700] Most people feel very free to talk about what other people think about Jesus.
[time=2704] That's far more comfortable than for me to talk about what I think about Jesus.
[time=2708] So it's very non-threatening.
[time=2710] He says, "Who do people say that I am?" And a variety of responses come.
[time=2714] First of all, some think you're John the Baptist.
[time=2717] That's strange.
[time=2718] John the Baptist is dead.
[time=2720] But they thought John the Baptist was somehow reincarnated and he's back on the scene.
[time=2724] That's what Herod thought according to Matthew 14.
[time=2727] We got rid of that John the Baptist, we cut off his head and now he's back.
[time=2732] Others thought, "Now this is Elijah." That made sense.
[time=2736] You see, of all the Old Testament prophets, Elijah was the preeminent miracle worker.
[time=2741] Jesus is doing miracles.
[time=2743] And the Old Testament said that someone coming in the Spirit and the power of Elijah would come.
[time=2749] So maybe this is that man.
[time=2752] Others thought, "Now you're Jeremiah." That makes sense too because Jeremiah was the most compassionate of all the prophets.
[time=2760] He was called the weeping prophet.
[time=2762] Jesus was full of compassion.
[time=2765] Also, Jeremiah was walking around indicting the leaders of his day for their spiritual wickedness.
[time=2774] Jesus had done the same.
[time=2777] Still others said, "We don't know who he is, but he must be one of the prophets." To boil it all down, everybody was saying two things.
[time=2785] One, Jesus is a great man.
[time=2788] Two, he is a man.
[time=2792] None of these people were ascribing to Jesus anything more than total humanity.
[time=2798] Great, magnificent, even possessor of prophetic abilities, but just human.
[time=2805] Jesus takes the issue and he makes it far more pointed.
[time=2811] He doesn't ask for a popular opinion poll, but he looks at them and he says, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2821] It's a far different question, isn't it?
[time=2823] Well, not just the difference in grammar, but the difference of impact.
[time=2828] Who do you say that Jesus is?
[time=2831] Intexually, obviously Jesus was asking those twelve men, but I believe in life.
[time=2837] He asked every one of us that same question to make a decision of what we believe about him.
[time=2842] Who do you believe Jesus is?
[time=2844] I believe that if Christ were here today, he'd be asking every one of us that question, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2851] We don't know whether there was a long silence and people looked at each other and kind of said, "You know, you go ahead and answer this one."
[time=2858] Or whether Peter and his usual impetuousness blurted out the answer.
[time=2863] We don't know, but it's Peter who answers, and for those who've read much about Peter, that's not a surprise.
[time=2868] He usually was found with his mouth open, and here's the case, but this time he's right on.
[time=2874] Jesus asked the question, "Peter gives a twofold response." He said, "Who are you? You're the Christ, the Son of the Living God." The term Christ is Greek for the Old Testament, Hebrew word, Messiah, which means the chosen, appointed one of God.
[time=2891] Son of the Living God refers to not just that this God's alive and that God's dead and that one we're not sure about.
[time=2900] Now it means this, it means you're the Son of the life-giving source God.
[time=2906] You're the one that has life existing within himself.
[time=2910] Now don't be confused about the word "son." The word "son" does not mean a diminutive term that there's a big God and then there's a little God.
[time=2920] God, the Father's big God, Jesus is a little God.
[time=2923] This God has all this power, he's just sort of God, not at all what it means.
[time=2927] Now if my son was here, he only stands about that tall.
[time=2932] You'd recognize him if you're here because he's the cutest boy in the place.
[time=2935] And he's all dressed up and he brought his shovel today for groundbreaking.
[time=2939] And you might look at him and say, "Father, big, son, little." But you're making a big mistake because you see, he's not just a son, I'm a son.
[time=2949] And any of you of the male gender, you know what?
[time=2954] It doesn't matter how old you are or how big you are, you're a son.
[time=2959] You see the word "son" in no way means something smaller or lesser.
[time=2964] It actually means something of the same order and substance.
[time=2970] So don't read into this, that Peter was saying, "Why, you're a little God, not at all." He was saying, "You're the same order and substance as the living life God.
[time=2981] You possess life in you, you're God." Now I attended the University of Akron, a good school, completely secular.
[time=2992] And we had a lot of classes where religion was discussed in Jesus Christ.
[time=2997] And in those where we didn't discuss it, I tried to bring it up.
[time=3000] And I remember repeatedly being suggested that Jesus never claimed to be God.
[time=3007] Only his disciples long after he died started those rumors.
[time=3012] Okay, let's examine that reasoning.
[time=3015] What we've got is we've got Jesus standing here saying, "Who do you say that I am?" We've got Peter over here and he says, "You're the Christ, the Son of the living God." Now Jesus has one of two options.
[time=3027] He can either one deny that, he could say, "No, no Peter.
[time=3032] You misunderstand.
[time=3033] You're blowing this thing all out of proportion.
[time=3036] I'm just a prophet or a traveling evangelist or whatever.
[time=3041] He could deny it, clarify the whole thing, or secondly he could confirm it.
[time=3046] Let's read what Jesus said.
[time=3048] What Jesus said boils down to five different statements.
[time=3052] We're going to look at three of those now, two of them tonight.
[time=3056] First thing he said is this, and it's a good play on words.
[time=3059] He says, "Blessed are you Simon, Son of John." Now the play on words is this.
[time=3065] Peter says, "Christ, Son of God." Jesus said, "Blessed, Simon, Son of Jonah." And that word blessing, we have totally wasted in English language.
[time=3079] We say, "God bless you to everything." If somebody sneezes, you know what we say?
[time=3083] "God bless you." I mean, of all the things you could bless in life, why are sneezes?
[time=3090] We've taken a word that had a very particular meaning and reduced it to nothing.
[time=3095] What Jesus was saying here is he's looking at Peter.
[time=3099] Peter's just said, "You're the Christ, the Son of the Living God." He said, "Totally, unique blessing for you to see that."
[time=3110] Wow, you've been given something that nobody else has gotten.
[time=3115] It's the first thing he says.
[time=3117] Second thing he says, in King James' flesh and blood has not revealed this under you, but my Father who is in heaven.
[time=3125] Now, by flesh and blood, or new international version, man, Jesus isn't saying,
[time=3131] "No other human being told you this." He was saying, "No human facility told you this." No other person told you this, or you didn't reason it with your own human mind.
[time=3141] This information is so special, so accurate.
[time=3145] It defies human wisdom.
[time=3147] That came straight from God himself.
[time=3150] I can't think of a way that Jesus could have more clearly or emphatically say, "Yes, Peter, I'm confirming what you say.
[time=3157] You're blessed.
[time=3158] Nobody's told you this, but God himself." It's an emphatic statement of Christ claiming to be God.
[time=3167] That's the first thing he said.
[time=3170] "Blessed are you, Simon Bargeome." Second thing is flesh and blood has not told you this.
[time=3177] No human being, but God himself has told you this.
[time=3182] Now the third thing gets a little stickier.
[time=3185] He says, "And I tell you that you are Peter.
[time=3190] And upon this rock, I will build my church." Now, his name is Simon.
[time=3198] He was born at a very young age.
[time=3200] He had a mother and a father and they said, "Ah, cute little baby boy.
[time=3203] We'll name him Simon." And he's been Simon his whole life.
[time=3208] But his brother says, "You've got to come see this guy.
[time=3211] I met him in Jesus.
[time=3212] And he goes and meets Jesus.
[time=3213] Jesus sees him.
[time=3214] First thing he says to them, "Hi, Simon.
[time=3216] You're going to be called Peter." When you think of a little string, somebody says, "Hi, Steve, glad to meet you.
[time=3223] Your name's going to be Fred." And nothing more becomes of that for two years.
[time=3231] And now, for the first time since then, Jesus calls him Peter again.
[time=3237] Now, what was Jesus doing?
[time=3240] We've got a picture of this.
[time=3241] Here's a guy who's given the great emotional vacillation.
[time=3245] One day is up.
[time=3246] The next day he's down.
[time=3248] The next day he is committed.
[time=3250] The next day I go fishing.
[time=3252] That's Peter.
[time=3254] Impulsive, impetuous, flamboyant, flippant.
[time=3260] But he's standing on the hard rock of Mount Herman.
[time=3265] And Jesus said, "I'm going to call you Peter." Now, Peter, Petros, means rock.
[time=3274] So what he's really saying is this in English.
[time=3277] "Hey, Simon.
[time=3279] I'm going to call you Rocky." That's really what he says.
[time=3284] I mean, I'm not playing with the words today.
[time=3285] I play with the words.
[time=3286] You know that.
[time=3287] I'm not doing, he said, "I'm going to call you rock." Now, now we really get into a problem.
[time=3294] Jesus said, "I'm going to call you rock, and upon this rock, I'm going to build my church." And history explodes with interpretation.
[time=3302] Did Jesus say, "I'm calling you rock, and on you, Peter, I'm going to build my church." Second possibility, he was saying, "I'm going to call you rock, and upon the rock-like statement that you made," which is, "I am the Christ.
[time=3318] I'll build my church." Third possibility, as he was saying, "I'm going to call you rock, and upon me a bigger rock, I'm going to build my church." Now, I want to be gracious, and I want to be clear today.
[time=3330] I really believe that if it wasn't for the teaching, that the church was built on Peter as the first pope, and the pope had infallibility and other unique teachings, every denomination would teach that Peter was the rock he was talking about.
[time=3348] Let me explain to you why.
[time=3351] This is only an analogy, and the Bible uses several analogies.
[time=3359] I believe that he was saying basically this.
[time=3365] I believe he was saying to you, "Blessed are you, Peter.
[time=3369] God's told you this, and I'm now going to call you Rocky,
[time=3375] and I'm going to build my church out of men and women just like you who are solid in the faith." Because that's what God builds his church out of, people.
[time=3387] Now, if you're a Catholic here today or watching by way of television, I believe you can be Catholic today and be born again in a part of God's family.
[time=3395] I also believe you can be Baptist, and that be true.
[time=3398] I also believe you can come to this church, be a member, and not be born again.
[time=3403] It's not denominations.
[time=3405] I don't believe that Peter was a pope.
[time=3407] I don't believe Peter ever thought he was a pope.
[time=3409] We'll talk about that more tonight.
[time=3411] But let's just clearly tell what the Scriptures teach.
[time=3415] 1 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11 settles the whole issue.
[time=3419] The apostle Paul said, "For other foundation can no man lay the not which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[time=3427] He alone is the foundation." As the hymn writer put it, "On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand. I dare not trust the sweetest fame, but holy lean on Jesus name.
[time=3441] I need no other argument. I need no other plea.
[time=3444] It is enough that Jesus died, and that he died from me." That is what the church is built on.
[time=3452] But Ephesians 2.20 says that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets.
[time=3461] You see, those are just analogies.
[time=3463] In the clear sense, Christ is the foundation.
[time=3465] But in another sense, Jesus said, "I'm building it out of people and the first level of people are those apostles," which Peter was the one talking.
[time=3474] And just the clarify, he says, "I'm building my church on the foundation of the apostles." Jesus Christ himself, the chief cornerstone.
[time=3483] Don't ever confuse that anybody possesses a position other than Christ himself as the founder and the foundation.
[time=3490] But secondly, don't confuse the fact that God says, "I'm building my church and I'm going to build it out of people." Just like Peter, people who are rock solid in their firm commitment to Jesus Christ.
[time=3503] Are you one of those people?
[time=3505] Are you solid in him? Unshakable.
[time=3508] If he were here today, would Christ call you Rocky?
[time=3513] That's what this is all about.
[time=3515] Christ said, "I will build my church." The gates of hell won't stop it.
[time=3521] And I'm going to do it out of people, just like you.
[time=3527] God make of us, people.
[time=3531] Firm in our faith, strong in our conviction, clear in our walk, rock like in our character.
[time=3543] Father today, we ask you to build your church at this very moment.
[time=3548] By speaking to the hearts of men and women who are not clearly committed to Christ, some are hiding behind past religious involvement.
[time=3557] They now know the right answers and they say them, but they've never committed their life to Christ.
[time=3564] God speak to them today and build your church out of them.
[time=3569] God, we ask you today to work in a way that no one else can and build your church even now.
[time=3577] For it's in Christ's name that we pray.
[time=3580] [AMEN] In the bulletin, it says by way of invitation that we would sing just as I am.
[time=3587] But today, we'll change that to him.
[time=3589] 4.23, on Christ the solid rock I stay.
[time=3593] Is your life today founded on the rock of Jesus Christ?
[time=3597] Are you trying to build it upon your church attendance?
[time=3600] Are you religiousness or your experiences as a child that really weren't valid as an adult?
[time=3608] If you today are on uncertain ground, plant your life on solid ground, the rock of Jesus Christ.
[time=3615] Would you receive him?
[time=3617] Others of you may have received Christ in recent weeks, but you've never made public your faith in him.
[time=3622] Would you today make your faith public?
[time=3625] Take a stand for Christ.
[time=3627] Others of you may want to join our church on this day.
[time=3629] We would welcome that and invite it.
[time=3631] If God spoke in your heart, you come as we sing.
[time=3634] Let's stand right now.
[time=3635] Him 4.23, Peter is going to lead us on Christ the solid rock I stand.
