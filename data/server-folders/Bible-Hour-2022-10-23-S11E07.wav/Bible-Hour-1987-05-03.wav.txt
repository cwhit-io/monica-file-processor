[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] - One of the wealthiest men of all times was Jay Paul Getty.
[time=115] It was obvious that he was a multi-millionaire.
[time=119] In an interview with a reporter, the reporter asked this question, "Mr. Getty, do you suppose that your millions have now accumulated to the point where you're actually a billionaire?"
[time=131] Mr. Getty said, "Yes, but remember, a billion doesn't buy today what it used to."
[time=137] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=154] Thank you for joining us.
[time=155] Rick's message today is taken from Proverbs, chapter 30, and is entitled, "Biblical Economics, Contentment."
[time=163] There is no economic resource more valuable than that of contentment, without it, no amount of financial resources is enough.
[time=171] With it, joy and fulfillment can abound in the most meager of circumstances.
[time=176] There is no correlation between increased wealth and lasting happiness.
[time=181] In fact, more often than not, just the opposite is true.
[time=185] With increased wealth comes increased appetite for more, fear of loss, stress, and worry.
[time=192] Today, as we return to our study of Proverbs, we begin a series on biblical economics.
[time=197] Our first lesson is contentment.
[time=200] So that you are able to study with us, please locate your Bibles and have them open to Proverbs, chapter 30.
[time=207] We will be looking at verses 7 through 9.
[time=210] Our special music today will be provided by the sanctuary choir, Dave and Debbie Johnson, and Lisa McNamara.
[time=221] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort White, Indiana,
[time=227] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=231] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=235] Now, here's where it is.
[time=239] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=245] It is a joy to welcome you this morning to our worship service.
[time=251] As we meet in this place, the very purpose of our lives and our assembly today is to declare that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=261] A few weeks ago, we celebrated that uniquely because it was Easter Sunday morning.
[time=266] But that's just not the truth of Easter. That's the truth of every Sunday.
[time=270] We meet on the first day of the week because we believe that he arose from the grave and that he is alive.
[time=277] Not only that he's alive, but he is the king.
[time=280] We sincerely hope that he is your king today.
[time=283] We welcome you this morning and also welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible hour.
[time=288] Our choir is going to sing along with the orchestra that Jesus Christ is the king.
[time=300] He is the king and he will reign forever.
[time=322] He is the king and we will sing his praise.
[time=329] The king and we will sing his praise forever.
[time=337] He is the king and he is the king.
[time=344] He is the king and he is the king and he is the king.
[time=359] He is the king and he will reign forever.
[time=382] He is the king and we will sing his praise forever.
[time=397] He is the king and he is the king and we will sing his praise forever.
[time=416] He is the king and he will reign forever.
[time=431] He is the king and he will sing his praise forever.
[time=443] He is the king and he is the king and he is the king and he is the king and he is the king.
[time=467] He is the king of kings and the king of lords.
[time=487] To God be all the glory for the great things that he does for us.
[time=492] Continue worshiping, singing number 52, singing all verses of him number 52.
[time=522] He is the king and he is the king and he is the king and he is the king.
[time=679] As we worship together it takes action on the part of everyone.
[time=683] We sing, we are greatly appreciative of your active participation and singing reflecting on what God has done for you personally as we sing collectively as a congregation.
[time=694] There is also a time of reflection when we listen to others sing and play and we allow the Holy Spirit to work in our lives through others.
[time=702] I hope that you will listen now as Dave and Debbie Johnson come to play for us on the violin and viola.
[time=708] Let's listen to their ministry of music now as they play for us.
[time=738] [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=856] [APPLAUSE]
[time=861] Hello again and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=866] Last Sunday Pete and I had the privilege of being a part of our church's groundbreaking service for the new sanctuary and we are certainly looking forward to that.
[time=873] Rick it was a very exciting day and not only that day but to be in my office on Monday morning and see the bulldozers and tractors moving dirt around it's really exciting.
[time=882] I wish that we could have shared the whole groundbreaking service with those of you who join us each week for the Bible Hour.
[time=889] We weren't able to have that time slot but we were able to videotape it and now we'd like to share with you some of the highlights of our groundbreaking service.
[time=898] So if you'll just watch the TV, our men in the control room are going to replay some highlights from last week's groundbreaking service for you.
[time=906] Our purpose today is to meet here, to pray together, to ceremony break the ground which should identify two things.
[time=914] Our commitment and dependence upon God to build his church and secondly it ceremony introduces the building of our new building.
[time=923] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=929] Sing to the Lord, give him the glory.
[time=935] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=942] Forever, more, let his love build here and let there be praise.
[time=950] He inhabits the praise of his people and dwells deep within.
[time=957] But he said he gives nine ten people his love.
[time=961] My name is Bob Mishler and my family and I were part of the original seven families to start Blackhawk.
[time=969] My name is Marvin Neff. My wife and I, Bula, were also a part of the original seven families along with Bob and Mary.
[time=978] Hi, my name is Aida Tafalo and it was just about this time of the year 14 years ago when the church voted to start the Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=988] That first year we began our school year with 33 students.
[time=992] Next year we're looking already at an enormous of over 300 with classes that are closed and waiting lists.
[time=1000] Hello, my name is Dale Siglin. In 1974 the Blackhawk Baptist Church began televising his morning worship service.
[time=1008] For the first year it was simply called Baptist Church service.
[time=1011] After that it was named the Heritage Hour and now finally the Bible Hour.
[time=1016] So now by faith, prayer and action we officially begin the building of our brand new sanctuary on this site.
[time=1025] This is the actual groundbreaking ceremony itself.
[time=1032] Ceremony introduces the building of our new worship center.
[time=1036] Some of the people you just heard from like Bob Mishler and Marv Neff were the original families that started Blackhawk about 18 years ago and two double wide trailers.
[time=1045] They're still part of our church and a part of our leadership.
[time=1049] These men that you've just seen are our staff and these are the deacons of our church.
[time=1053] laymen who volunteer their time to give guidance and help to the whole building program and the church at large.
[time=1061] Our congregation was asked to bring shovels because it's their church and their building just as much as any of the leaderships and they participated with us in the groundbreaking ceremony for our new worship center here at Blackhawk.
[time=1076] The sign is right out at the beginning of the property and as you go by on state and lay mire you can see it and it's just a reminder that it won't be long and there'll be a steel structure begun, footings in place and that building will be going up very rapidly.
[time=1090] You know we've been working for two years on the design and the development, feasibility, stays and all that and it's hard to see anything happen but boy once those bulldozers came it got exciting.
[time=1101] They're on it now for sure. Well we want to ask you to be praying with us that God gives us wisdom with each of the decisions we still have before us in building this new sanctuary that it might meet the needs of this growing congregation and be that which glorifies the Lord.
[time=1117] We're thankful you've joined us today. From time to time we share an excellent little Bible so they booklet with you and today I would like to do that again.
[time=1126] It's titled Timeless Insights and it's exactly that. It's insight from God's Word and it's timeless. God's Word is relevant today.
[time=1136] It'll be relevant tomorrow and it was relevant hundreds of years ago. It is timeless and the rich insights in God's Word are as relevant and powerful as the most current teaching could ever be.
[time=1149] Even today we'll be talking about contentment. One of the most needed values any of us could have. Well you and I need to keep growing in our Christian life and the best way we can do that is through studying God's Word on a daily basis.
[time=1163] This booklet is a New Testament study guide. It will take you from Matthew through Revelation in one year's time giving you some timeless insights.
[time=1172] If you'd like a copy simply write to us today. If you'd like a copy write to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1184] Once again the address is the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. Thank you for joining us today and as we go back to our morning worship service we're looking forward to hearing music that will glorify the Lord
[time=1200] and I'm looking forward to a message on contentment that I'm going to share with you today.
[time=1230] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=1323] God as we've heard played this morning we must confess, prone to wander, Lord I feel it, prone to leave the God I love.
[time=1335] Here's my heart Lord, take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above. Lord that's our prayer this very morning. We know that we are prone to wander.
[time=1348] We vacillate, we slide in literally every direction. God we ask today for forgiveness for our spiritual apathy and indifference.
[time=1361] The times that we've so clearly said yes to you and then we have failed to obey. God we know that if we simply trust in our own strength we will not be what you want us to be spiritually.
[time=1375] And so we today say with the hymn writer, here's my heart, oh take and seal it, seal it for your use of Lord. God we give our lives to you and ask you to use them and empower them for your glory.
[time=1392] God we would pray today for part of the beloved that is suffering deeply, those who have lost loved ones. We pray particularly for Debbie Middleton and the sudden death of her father.
[time=1405] For the loved ones of Gertrude Geller, she is now with you and for the family of Don George. We thank you that he know Christ and he has eternal life.
[time=1418] Father we pray for those who are battling with their health today. We pray for Jane Vanderford, Marv Daggetz and Kila Garten and Barb Downey.
[time=1429] God we ask you to give wisdom to their doctors and strengthen them in their spirit as they go through some tough battles. Father we pray today for homes that are fractured, some more like ruptured, that you would bring healing.
[time=1447] We pray for the strain between spouses that has been brought about because of clearly sin. Other times it's brought about by misunderstanding. God we ask you to be a healing source today.
[time=1463] God if it weren't for your grace we would have nothing, not a thing. Father we thank you that you love us though we have not taken the initiative to love you, that you provide for us though we often ignore you.
[time=1478] God your grace is amazing and we love you today and thank you for your amazing grace. In Jesus name, Amen.
[time=1508] I was lost but now I am found, was blind but now I see.
[time=1537] It was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears free.
[time=1565] How precious did that grace appear, the hour I first gave.
[time=1589] Through many dangers, toys and snails I have already come.
[time=1613] 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.
[time=1636] For we've been there ten times in the right shining air for our soul.
[time=1710] Thank you Lisa, the message of amazing grace, beautifully sung and so powerful in content. God's grace comes to us undeservingly and he gives us eternal life.
[time=1723] Then by his grace he keeps us and then ultimately by grace we live with him in heaven and when we've been there ten thousand years it's just the start, just the warm up.
[time=1735] That's the anticipation of our life in Christ. We hope you know him if you don't today. I hope that you'll give serious attention to the fact that Christ may be the real source that you're looking for in your life.
[time=1750] If you have a Bible with you today I want to invite you to open it to the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1755] If you're not familiar with the Scriptures in the very front of your Bible there'll be an index. Proverbs is found halfway through the Old Testament right next to the Book of Psalms.
[time=1764] We're going to start with Proverbs chapter 30. If you come to Blackhawk or you're fairly new and you didn't bring a Bible let me encourage you in the future to do that because that's the nature of our study here is to open up the Scriptures week by week.
[time=1779] This story was printed in Reader's Digest some time ago. It was an English teacher giving the assignment to a group of students trying to help them to develop their skills in not only composition but grammar.
[time=1793] She found a way of making them more excited about writing than usually they were found to be. The assignment was she said assume that you have now been given one million dollars right down how you would use that money, how you would spend it, how you would invest it, what you would do with it.
[time=1812] All they eagerly began to write that was an exciting assignment. The teacher reported that on one day a girl threw her papers down in the desk and came up and said it's not enough.
[time=1823] I need another hundred thousand dollars. I'm not sure that many of us here have a million dollars or that we're ever prone to dream about it.
[time=1833] But isn't that awful and dieting that most of us if we unleashed our dreams and our wants not even a million dollars would be enough in a word we lack contentment.
[time=1846] In Proverbs 30 we come to one of the simplest yet most powerful prayers of all time and it only has two themes one of them is contentment.
[time=1856] The man praying we know very little about his name is agur, A-G-U-R. He wrote this 30th chapter of Proverbs. We don't know too much about him but here is his simple prayer in Proverbs 30 verse 7.
[time=1871] It says, "Two things I ask of you O Lord, do not refuse me before I die." Here's the first request, "Keep falsehood and lies far from me." The second request, "Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread."
[time=1899] Otherwise I may have too much in disown you and say, "Who's the Lord?"
[time=1912] This passage, as I said, contains two simple prayer requests. The first one, let's say it's a prayer for integrity.
[time=1922] God, keep falsehood and lies far from me. The second one our theme for today is a prayer from contentment. Under contentment he says, "Lord, keep me from extremes. Don't give me poverty."
[time=1937] On the other hand he says, "God, don't give me riches. I pray at least half of that prayer. God, don't give me poverty." Most of you have probably prayed that. Not as many of us pray, "Lord, don't give me riches."
[time=1953] But he had a motive. He said, "God, don't give me poverty because I may then be tempted to steal to meet daily needs, and I'm dishonoring you. But God, don't give me an abundance either. Because all of us as humans, the more we have, the more proud we become, and the more pride filled we are, the more we say, "Look what I have. Look what I've done. Look what I've achieved. Notice my accomplishments."
[time=1982] And we say, "Who is the Lord? I've done this." It's a simple prayer for contentment.
[time=1989] Well, today we're beginning a series of messages out of Proverbs that we're calling biblical economics. But before we can ever look at biblical economics, we need to know what are our real assets and what are our real liabilities.
[time=2007] We have some real assets economically if we possess these things. Contentment, satisfaction, gratitude, peace, and fulfillment.
[time=2024] If you have those assets in your portfolio, you'll have a strong economics to build on.
[time=2033] Here are some liabilities that we also carry in our portfolio. Discontentment, strive in dissatisfaction, jealousy which says, "You've got it, and I want it."
[time=2055] Envy which says, "You've got it, and because I can't have it, I don't want you to have it either."
[time=2062] Before we ever start making sense out of the dollars, we better have the right attitudes about economics.
[time=2072] And the most critical one the Book of Proverbs brings to us is an attitude about contentment.
[time=2079] Here, this man prayed, "God, I'm content to be in the middle. God, I'm not so ignorant that I say, "Oh, don't give me a thing. I know I need daily bread."
[time=2089] When he prayed for daily bread, when Jesus and the Lord's prayer said, "Ask for your daily bread." He wasn't talking about wholesome bread.
[time=2096] You know, just a loaf. That's why bread really is a euphemism for simple needs. Not wants, not desires, but God at least meet me at the point of my needs.
[time=2107] And with that, I'll be content. And if you give me more, I'll be thankful.
[time=2112] A couple of the Proverbs found in Proverbs 27 teaches how dangerous it is when we have a lack of contentment in our life.
[time=2121] Look at Proverbs 27, verse 4, to begin with, please.
[time=2128] Anger is cruel. Fury overwhelming. But who can stand before jealousy?
[time=2138] What Solomon's saying here is there are some negative attitudes that are consequential. Anger is one of those.
[time=2146] It's downright cruel. If you ever have to deal with an angry person, you're on dangerous ground.
[time=2151] Fury, it can be overwhelming. But neither anger nor fury are quite as awesome as jealousy.
[time=2160] Who can stand when jealousy takes over? Jealousy is a form of discontentment.
[time=2167] A little later on, in verse 20 of the same chapter, he adds this insight. Death and destruction are never satisfied.
[time=2179] And neither are the eyes of a man. Death is inevitable. All of us are going to die.
[time=2185] It's here viewed personified as a force as though it's trying to grab at someone else.
[time=2191] And no matter how many of us die, death never says, "That's enough. I don't need any more."
[time=2198] Just as death constantly takes more and more, our eyes, our appetites, always desire more.
[time=2206] One of the wealthiest men of all times was J. Paul Getty. He was obviously a multi-multi-millionaire.
[time=2215] He was being interviewed by a columnist who said, "Mr. Getty, we all know that you're a multi-millionaire, but have your assets reached a billion dollars? Are you a billionaire?" And somewhat hesitatingly, Getty said, "Yes, but just remember a billion dollars doesn't buy what it used to buy.
[time=2233] How much is enough if a billion dollars can't buy enough?"
[time=2241] Contentment. The lack of it puts us on dangerous grounds.
[time=2246] Proverbs chapter 13 makes an interesting insight as well. It says in verse 7, "One man pretends to be rich, yet he has nothing. Another man pretends to be poor, yet he has great wealth."
[time=2262] Isn't it amazing that we always feel like the other guy's position looks better than ours?
[time=2267] All of you know somebody, I certainly know several somebodies, who they are poor.
[time=2275] They've got no resources, but they desperately try to camouflage that,
[time=2281] and they try to represent themselves as highly successful in the financial area.
[time=2286] And they're always saying, "Oh, I let me buy, and all things are going great." Outcomes the credit card, and for the next year they pay for it three more times, trying to impress us that they're really rich.
[time=2299] And yet at the same time there's somebody who, they've got more money than they could possibly spend if they set out to make it their mission to spend it.
[time=2308] Yet they drive the used car, needs tires.
[time=2312] Where's the old clothes, trying to represent themselves as significantly less affluent as they are?
[time=2320] We always think the other guys in a better position.
[time=2323] One time in the newspaper there was a picture of two different fields, both full of grass.
[time=2330] Divided down the middle was a fence. On each side of the fence there was a donkey with his head through the fence eating the grass on the other side.
[time=2341] It always looks better on the other side.
[time=2344] Contentment, a rare, rare value.
[time=2349] When we lack contentment, we literally endanger our lives in at least these five ways from the Book of Proverbs.
[time=2357] First of all, if we're discontent, we strain our relationships.
[time=2361] Turn with me if you will to Proverbs 15 and verse 16.
[time=2365] Proverbs 15 and verse 16.
[time=2369] It says better a little with the fear of the Lord than great wealth with turmoil.
[time=2376] Better a meal of vegetables where there's love than a fat and calf with hatred.
[time=2384] And now look at verse 27 of the same chapter.
[time=2388] Our greedy man brings trouble to his family.
[time=2393] You know, all of us as parents have someone of a built-in protective instinct when it comes to our children.
[time=2399] We're very careful as to how soon in life we let them play in the front yard instead of the back yard.
[time=2405] Back yard is just a little safer. Front yard, there's cars, so we're just a little bit more cautious.
[time=2411] We're protective of our children.
[time=2414] When our children get in the car, we make them wear seat belts for two reasons.
[time=2418] One, we want to protect them, two, it keeps them in the back seat.
[time=2421] But we have these protective instincts.
[time=2424] If we really wanted to protect our children, one of the greatest protections we could give them
[time=2430] would be living a life of contentment.
[time=2434] Because when our life gets out of balance, we bring trouble to our entire family.
[time=2442] Solomon knew it. He wasn't content.
[time=2445] He had an insatiable desire for more and with it came trouble to his house.
[time=2450] Earlier verses in Proverbs says, "It's better to live a vegetarian diet where there's love and contentment
[time=2459] and strong relationships than to risk the relationships because with the discontentment comes anxiety
[time=2465] and strife and suddenly we've got it all.
[time=2469] We just can't stand the people who are at the table with us as we enjoy it all."
[time=2475] Ecclesiastes 4, 6, and Proverbs 17, 1 are worth looking at later because they just reinforce
[time=2482] that where there's no contentment, we strain our relationships.
[time=2487] Secondly, if we're discontent, we strain our health.
[time=2491] One chapter earlier, chapter 14 and verse 30 teaches us this.
[time=2498] A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.
[time=2507] Do you know that the emotions that we go through when we lack contentment can literally
[time=2515] impair our health and even ultimately take our life?
[time=2520] Now, there are a number of things that may be hereditary.
[time=2524] High blood pressure, heart attack and heart disease, migraine headaches, ulcers, they may be hereditary.
[time=2534] Some of those things may be caused by diet, but just as often as those other two sources,
[time=2541] they are the result of emotional tension that comes because we are driven people and we've
[time=2548] got to do more so that we have more satisfaction in life, more possessions and that we're driven.
[time=2556] And here it says, "Ah, a heart that's not driven, a heart that's content, a heart that's
[time=2562] at peace," that gives life to the bones.
[time=2568] At the same time, envy, that desire for more, it rots our bones.
[time=2574] Some one book of the Bible later, to the book of Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiastes chapter 5.
[time=2582] In Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 10, it warns us, "Whoever loves money never has enough."
[time=2593] Do you know, many times we think, "If I could just get a little bit more, that's all I need."
[time=2600] One wealthy Englishman was coming down the stairs quietly.
[time=2603] He heard one of the employees who took care of the house muttering saying, "Ah, if I just had ten pounds more, a pound is a British measurement of money.
[time=2613] Ah, if I just had ten pounds more." He went back upstairs, pulled out a note, came downstairs and gave this employee a ten pound note,
[time=2623] walked away and heard him say, "Ah, I should have said twenty-five." Now, if we love money, enough is never enough.
[time=2634] Whoever loves money never has enough.
[time=2636] Whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income.
[time=2641] As goods increase, so do those who consume them.
[time=2645] That means your in-laws come over for dinner.
[time=2648] And what benefit are they to the owner except the feast his eyes on them?
[time=2652] Do you ever stop and think, "What good does five cars do you if you can only drive one at a time?" Well, you can look at them, buy cars to look at.
[time=2661] Except the feast your eyes on them.
[time=2663] The sleep of a labor is sweet.
[time=2665] Now we're getting into the health.
[time=2667] The sleep of a labor is sweet, whether he eats little or much.
[time=2672] But the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep.
[time=2677] Sleeplessness, anxiety, worry, high blood pressure, headaches, type A behavior,
[time=2685] phasic attitudes, and action.
[time=2687] Where's it come from?
[time=2689] I've got to do more.
[time=2690] I've got to achieve more.
[time=2691] A lack of contentment.
[time=2693] It will strain your health.
[time=2695] Third thing it will do is it will strain your integrity.
[time=2698] Turn to Proverbs 28.
[time=2702] Proverbs 28 and verse 20.
[time=2710] It says, "A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished."
[time=2720] What's Solomon saying there?
[time=2722] He's saying this, "When we are faithful, ultimately that will be blessed and our income
[time=2732] will rise accordingly.
[time=2734] But when we're eager, driven to get rich quick, there comes the temptation to compromise.
[time=2742] We learn that in every business there's a way of saving costs, cutting corners,
[time=2748] and increasing your own profit." And the Bible says that desire to get rich quick will cause you to compromise your integrity.
[time=2760] The fourth thing it will do, it will not only strain your relationships, strain your health,
[time=2766] strain your integrity, a lack of contentment will strain your own future.
[time=2771] Chapter 21, verse 5, please.
[time=2778] Proverbs 21 and verse 5, it reads like this, "The plans of the diligent lead to profit,
[time=2786] as surely as haste leads to poverty.
[time=2790] If you want to get rich, you've got to be patient and you've got to be diligent.
[time=2796] If you want to become poor, and I haven't met a person yet who came into my office and said, "Rick, you've got to help me.
[time=2803] I've been working at it for nine years and I just can't get poor.
[time=2808] But if that's your desire, the best way you can become poor is to become discontent
[time=2814] and want to be rich, fast." And when you do that, you jeopardize your own future.
[time=2823] Just a few verses later, 21, 17 adds this further insight.
[time=2829] Proverbs 21, 17, "He who loves pleasure will be come poor, and who so ever loves wine and oil will never be rich."
[time=2840] You see, every time you've got a dollar, you've got two choices.
[time=2844] You can spend it now or you can save it for later.
[time=2848] And that discontent spirit that says, "I want the oil and the wine and the party and the car and the good life, and I want it now." You're jeopardizing your whole future.
[time=2860] Ron Blue and his excellent book, "Mashing Your Money" gave a formula that staggered me.
[time=2867] I think it's simple enough that we can follow it.
[time=2871] If you at the age of 20 started investing $1,000 a year,
[time=2879] each year for 40 years until you were 60, which means you would make a total of investment of $40,000, $1,000 a year for 40 years.
[time=2889] If you invested that at 12 percent, and I know today's rates don't support that, two years ago, more than supported it.
[time=2898] At the end of 40 years, you would have invested $40,000,
[time=2904] but the interest you would have earned would make you the proud owner of a $1,000,000 bank account.
[time=2912] You see, that's the difference between saying, "I'll spend that $1,000 right now, or I'll defer the pleasure on invested diligently, and at age 60, I'll have a million dollars." But you see, our lack of contentment, it jeopardizes our whole future because we spend it now, and it's always gone.
[time=2932] And our future is insecure.
[time=2936] The Bureau of Economic Statistics released this information a number of years ago that at age 65, 5 percent of us will be dead and gone.
[time=2947] And at age 65, 90 percent of us will not be able to adequately live
[time=2953] on social security and our own investments, which means that at age 65, 95 percent of us will either be dead or dead broke.
[time=2965] And yet, most of us here could have comfortably earned $1 million
[time=2973] by simply taking $1,000 out of our income each year for those 40 years.
[time=2980] Now, our purpose today is not financial planning, and if it were, it would not be me speaking.
[time=2986] But allow that illustration to stand.
[time=2988] There are very few of us here who could not take $1,000 out of our income
[time=2995] and invest it, but very few of us do.
[time=3000] I don't want to be insensitive, I know many could not, but most could.
[time=3004] That's just the economics of our society and of this church.
[time=3009] The average person in Allen County this year makes in excess of $30,000.
[time=3015] The average person in Allen County this year received a raise last year of more than $1,000.
[time=3022] But the average person in Allen County has already spent $1,000 more this year than they did last year, and it is gone.
[time=3029] Lack of contentment, strange relationships, it strains your health, it strains your integrity,
[time=3038] it will strain your future and at least finally this, and most importantly, it will strain your spiritual life.
[time=3046] Turn to chapter 19 and verse 23. Proverbs 19, 23.
[time=3055] Proverbs 19, the 23 verse says.
[time=3060] The fear of the Lord leads to life.
[time=3064] Now let me just interrupt here.
[time=3065] It's not saying physical life, it is talking about life in its fullest sense.
[time=3071] Everybody here today is alive.
[time=3074] One or two of you are on the verge right now of slipping away, but we're all alive here.
[time=3081] That's not what it's talking about.
[time=3084] It's talking about some of us have got life.
[time=3088] Others of us, our tombstone will read, died in '68, buried in '88.
[time=3096] Well, there's no life, there's no joy, there's no fulfillment.
[time=3101] It says here, 23, the fear of the Lord leads to life, fulfillment.
[time=3105] Then one rests content, untouched by trouble.
[time=3114] The anxiety, tension in our relationships and our health most often comes from
[time=3121] a lack of contentment in our soul.
[time=3125] A further insight comes from chapter 23, verse 17.
[time=3130] It reads, "Do not let your heart envy sinners be always, but always be zealous for the fear of the Lord."
[time=3145] How does it endanger our spiritual life and strain it?
[time=3148] According to 23, 17, it misleads our heart.
[time=3153] You see, we look at people who, they've gotten fast, rich, and they've shaved a few corners and we look at all they have and suddenly we become envious and we go, "Oh, man, how to do that?"
[time=3166] And our heart is misled.
[time=3168] Instead, we ought to be zealous for the Lord.
[time=3173] Another insight comes from chapter 18 and verse 11.
[time=3178] It reads, "The wealth of the rich is their fortified city.
[time=3183] They imagine it and unskilled a wall."
[time=3189] You see, when we have a great deal of wealth and we're discontent and we want more, we misplace our security.
[time=3198] We think that, "Oh, if I'd have just done what ox said, if I'd have just had that million dollars, if I'd have just been the one that saved up," then I, no.
[time=3206] God can give you a million dollars and He can take it away just like that.
[time=3212] Proverbs 16, 16, this final insight about our spiritual life.
[time=3220] It reads, "How much better to get wisdom than gold to choose understanding than silver?"
[time=3227] You see, discontentment leads us to misdirect our pursuits.
[time=3232] It leads us to mislead our heart, to misplace our trust, and to misdirect our pursuits.
[time=3240] You see, if you were in a class in economics, they would be talking to you about real wealth, metaphysical wealth, real wealth, money, gold, silver, assets, real assets, real property.
[time=3256] That's the real wealth, according to the economists.
[time=3259] Metaphysical wealth, according to the economists, are contentment, joy, peace, good relationships,
[time=3269] but the economists are wrong.
[time=3273] You see, the real wealth is this stuff.
[time=3276] It's wisdom.
[time=3277] It's knowing God.
[time=3279] It's having His forgiveness.
[time=3281] That's real wealth.
[time=3284] This is not real wealth.
[time=3286] This helps to meet daily needs, to grant a few desires.
[time=3291] It can be shared.
[time=3293] That's not wealth.
[time=3296] Let me boil this down to six very simple, practical...
[time=3301] I'm not sure they're applications because they're not things you take home and you do.
[time=3305] They're attitudes you adopt.
[time=3307] Let's leave them with that.
[time=3308] Attitudes to adopt.
[time=3309] Six of them, very quickly.
[time=3311] One, realize that more is usually not better.
[time=3317] We often think, if I just had a little bit more, things would be better.
[time=3322] Secondly, when we get more, then comes the hassle of maintaining it, insurance, caring for it.
[time=3330] More is usually not necessarily better.
[time=3334] Secondly, having more will not increase your satisfaction, only your desires.
[time=3342] How many of you, and we will not have a show of hands, on Thanksgiving or some other day, have absolutely gourged yourself to the point of pain.
[time=3351] Then, under these words, I'll never need to eat again.
[time=3357] Your laughter's incriminating.
[time=3359] Did you ever eat again?
[time=3361] You bet you did.
[time=3362] You not only eat again, you ate more.
[time=3364] Because your stomach was this size, don't you wish.
[time=3368] And when we overeat, it gets stretched out.
[time=3372] And when it makes all those funny noises, digesting it, it shrinks back, but it doesn't shrink back here.
[time=3377] It only shrinks back to here, leaving an even larger cavity, an even greater appetite.
[time=3383] And the original satisfaction did not increase our contentment.
[time=3388] It only increased our future appetite.
[time=3391] And it's that way with everything.
[time=3393] The more we have, the more we want.
[time=3397] Principle number three.
[time=3398] Be thankful for what you have and what you don't have.
[time=3403] You know, just enjoy what you have.
[time=3405] Be grateful.
[time=3406] If you've got it, praise the Lord.
[time=3408] If you don't have it, say, "God, for some reason, you didn't want me to have it." And I'll be grateful for that, too.
[time=3414] Principle number four.
[time=3416] Learn to enjoy what you have.
[time=3419] It is enough.
[time=3423] There's something about us that we always have to have more, and more, and more.
[time=3427] I'm like a child.
[time=3428] I love new games, new toys.
[time=3430] I've got a new 10-speed bike, and I'm out there riding.
[time=3433] It wasn't long before that.
[time=3434] New 10-speed bike wasn't quite enough.
[time=3436] I had to have a little, just a little odometer.
[time=3438] You know, just want to know how far you're going.
[time=3440] Look at your watch.
[time=3441] Read the odometer.
[time=3442] How fast are you going?
[time=3443] Two miles an hour.
[time=3444] That's not bad.
[time=3445] You know, bike wasn't, they had to have no odometer.
[time=3447] That odometer.
[time=3448] You know, you had to look down there, and then you had to calculate and watch.
[time=3450] What I really needed was just a little computer.
[time=3452] It goes right there.
[time=3454] Now I've got one.
[time=3455] Put that on there, I got out and I rode that bike, and I love that.
[time=3458] I push all those buttons.
[time=3459] It tells me how slow I'm going.
[time=3461] You know, I hadn't ridden that bike in three weeks.
[time=3464] I had to have it all.
[time=3466] You know what I've really been doing?
[time=3468] I went home to my parents' house a couple of weeks ago, and I rediscovered a game I had when I was 10 years old, and I play with it more than anything else.
[time=3477] What I already had was enough.
[time=3480] It was enough.
[time=3482] There was a man by the name of Fyrus, P-Y-R-R-H-U-S, lived 300 years before Christ.
[time=3489] He said to his chief consolary, "I will attack Rome and take it." His consolary said, "Not a good plan, and if you did, what would you do?" And he said, "Then I would take Carthage." He said, "Then what?" "Then Alexandria." He said, "Then what?" He said, "Then I'd come home and enjoy my kingdom." And his consolary said, "Why not do that now?" He was already a king.
[time=3513] What we have is enough.
[time=3515] Principal number four.
[time=3518] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our sanctuary choir, soloist Lisa McNamara
[time=3526] and Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=3528] The message was from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3531] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God, just before we close, will you pray this prayer with me?
[time=3540] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3547] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3550] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3555] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed this prayer today, would you write us and tell us that you prayed?
[time=3562] And when you write, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
