[time=90] >> After walking the aisles of the bookstore several time, he decided he needs some help finding the book he wanted.
[time=118] So the gentleman went up to the sales lady, a rather attractive young lady, and he said, "Ma'am, could you help me find a book?"
[time=126] She asked what it was he was looking for. He said, "The title is "Man, the superior sex."
[time=132] The sales lady thought for a moment and she said, "I'm not sure we have that book, but if we do, it's in the fiction section, two aisles over."

[time=154] >> Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hobbs. We're glad you've chosen to spend part of your day with us.
[time=162] Rick's message today is entitled "A Woman for All Times." The role of women in society has changed significantly and will no doubt continue to do so. Much of it has been for the better, but not all.
[time=176] Unfortunately, often the quest for equality brings not only the equal benefits, but equality in shortcomings as well.
[time=184] Proverbs describes a woman who was able to balance the scale of both being a gracious lady and a respected woman in what was once a man's world. She is a woman for all times.
[time=194] Please locate your Bibles so that you are able to study along with us.
[time=200] We will be hearing special music today from the Sanctuary Choir.
[time=204] Marsha Ives, the Black Hawk Singers, and Brian Lowson.
[time=212] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=222] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=228] Now, here's Rick.
[time=230] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=234] We trust that during this hour together we can magnify the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=240] Thank Him for His every gift and His every goodness, and particularly the goodness and the gift that He gave to us in the form of a loving mother.
[time=250] We're delighted that you're here today as we've come to praise the Lord together and to remember the great power of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=260] Could everyone understand Him? Not always.
[time=264] They could not.
[time=266] Could they keep Him in the grave?
[time=270] They could not.
[time=272] Do people always understand Him today?
[time=274] They could not.
[time=276] But His power is real.
[time=278] Whether people accept it or reject it, He is real.
[time=284] Our choir sings a beautiful song of praise.
[time=288] They could not.
[time=290] They could not keep Him in the grave.
[time=292] They looked at Him and saw a symbol man.
[time=316] Our garments were with healing in His hands.
[time=322] They saw Him on the sea and in a dying land.
[time=328] They saw what could they really understand.
[time=336] They could not.
[time=352] It was just a simple part to do with healing in His hands.
[time=358] Whether they really understand.
[time=362] They could not.
[time=370] They listened to the teaching that gave her.
[time=376] I wonder how love is free on His world.
[time=384] They wondered what He meant about the Father's plan.
[time=390] They heard what the name really understood.
[time=398] They could not.
[time=412] They listened to the teaching that gave her.
[time=420] They really understand.
[time=422] They could not.
[time=436] So finally upon on the network.
[time=442] They killed the man who would not suffer alone.
[time=450] And through that last day's room, what will it be today?
[time=456] The time art will make Him in the grave.
[time=466] They could not.
[time=472] They saw.
[time=478] [MUSIC - 70 seconds]
[time=574] I'm not sure how the response is back there, but if you listen to that music and you listen especially to the words, could they keep him in the grave? They could not.
[time=584] That demands a great amen in our souls for those of us that believe in the fact that Jesus died for our sins and rose again, individually for us, so that we could accept him as our personal Savior.
[time=596] 436 published that great tidings, tidings of peace and joy, 436.

[time=644] Verses 4, 3, and 5.
[time=788] Thank you very much for your good singing. We appreciate it.
[time=792] Just a few years ago, a young lady came to Fort Wayne and began attending our church.
[time=798] Her name is Marsha Ives. And just a couple weeks ago, she announced to me that she'd be moving to Upper Michigan.
[time=806] Can you imagine anyone wanting to leave Fort Wayne in Deanna?
[time=810] Well, she has a pretty good excuse because there's a young man named Carol Peterson waiting for her in Upper Michigan and they'll be getting married in June.
[time=820] And we're really glad for Marsha and that opportunity.
[time=824] The only sad part is that she will not have the opportunity to sing for us on a regular basis.
[time=830] She's been very faithful in our choir and special groups and ministering to us as a soloist.
[time=834] We do really appreciate the fact that she's been with us these few short years.
[time=840] There's a song we talked about what she would sing and she had one picked out and she changed her mind.
[time=844] The song that she's singing this morning is My Savior, first of all.
[time=848] And that is exactly the message that Marsha wishes to portray that she wants to live for Christ
[time=854] and wants to give that message to you that first in her life is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=860] Let's listen as Marsha sings for us.
[time=862] [MUSIC] When my life will work as ended [MUSIC] And I cross the swelling tide [MUSIC] When that bright and glorious morning I shall see [MUSIC] I shall know my Redeemer [MUSIC] When I reach the other side [MUSIC] And his smile will be the first to welcome me [MUSIC] I shall know him, I shall know him [MUSIC] And redeemed by his side I shall stand [MUSIC] I shall know him, I shall know him [MUSIC] By the print of the nails in his hand [MUSIC] Through the gates to the city [MUSIC] In a robe of spotless white [MUSIC] He will lead me where no tears will ever fall [MUSIC] When that bled soul of ages will show me with daylight [MUSIC] But I want to see my Savior first of all [MUSIC] I shall know him, I shall know him [MUSIC] And redeemed by his side I shall stand [MUSIC] I shall know him, I shall know him [MUSIC] By the print of the nails in his hand [MUSIC] By the print of the nails in his hand [MUSIC] In his hands in his hands â™ª
[time=1038] Hello and thank you for joining us again today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1044] Today is Mother's Day here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1046] I know we're a week delayed in Marion and South Bend, but I'm looking forward to calling my mom today.
[time=1050] I have the same plan. They live out in the west coast so I can call rather late from Fort Wayne tonight and hopefully I'll get through the lines.
[time=1058] Well, I'm looking forward to that. Tell your mother I said hello.
[time=1062] I'll do that. I had a pleasant time last night at the Bill Gather concert here at the Coliseum. Wish you could have gone.
[time=1068] There are a number of people already that I've seen this morning that said it was a great time of fellowship.
[time=1072] And speaking of concerts, we have eternity coming up on June 4th.
[time=1076] That's a Thursday evening, Rick. Eternity is a group of young people.
[time=1080] I think they have about six vocalists and ten instrumentalists.
[time=1082] They've been here before. They travel around the country.
[time=1086] They're a great musical team. They'll be entertaining as well as ministry-oriented.
[time=1090] I think that's a great evening for young people in particular to come and enjoy eternity.
[time=1096] I'm really looking forward to them. They were one of my favorite groups that we had in.
[time=1100] It's probably been four or five years since they've been here.
[time=1104] But they have a lot of energy, very contemporary sound.
[time=1106] And we want to encourage all of you to feel welcome to come.
[time=1110] But particularly those of you who like a little bit more contemporary flavor of Christian music.
[time=1116] Then later in the summer, we have somebody a little bit different.
[time=1118] Variety, Burt Kenninger coming.
[time=1120] Burt Kenninger will be here in July as part of our summer Bible conference, which of course you know we're switching our normal Wednesday evening service to Thursday night so that perhaps people in our area, if they have church on Wednesday night, can take advantage of our services and summer Bible conferences on Thursday.
[time=1136] Well, we do want you to set that day to side of June the 4th for the eternity concert.
[time=1140] And then following that every Thursday, the summer Bible conference will be here and we're really looking forward to that special time of input from God's Word.
[time=1150] Last night, as I mentioned to Pete, I was at the Bill Gather concert and I met Bible hour viewers from South Bend and from Define, Ohio and I want to thank all of you who encourage us by letting us know that you watch this television ministry.
[time=1166] In fact, that encouragement means so much to us.
[time=1168] We'd like to ask you to take the time, perhaps even today, to take out a pen, some paper and jot us a note and tell us how God is using the ministry of the Bible hour in your life.
[time=1180] It would be such an encouragement to us.
[time=1182] Pete, you found out way up in Michigan, there are many people watching there too.
[time=1186] Right, you mentioned the East because you're more from Ohio and I'm from southern Michigan and just last night I got a call from my sister-in-law and she was visiting some people and they somehow got on the Bible hour and said that they watch it regularly.
[time=1198] So if you're from southern Michigan, we'd like to hear from you too.
[time=1200] If you're watching the Bible hour, just write us a note and say thank you for the Bible hour or whatever you'd like to say to us.
[time=1206] We'd be encouraged by your response to the television program.
[time=1212] Last week you saw the groundbreaking service for our new sanctuary and Dale Siegel, the producer and director of the Bible hour, mentioned a little bit about the history of this television ministry.
[time=1222] It started off simply as Baptist Church services, wasn't that an exciting name?
[time=1228] And then it was the heritage hour, a very good word for the '70s as we were going through the bicentennial of our country, but somehow the word heritage really didn't grab the essence of what this ministry is.
[time=1240] And so it wasn't long before it was changed to the Bible hour, and that's really the basics of what our television ministry and our church is all about.
[time=1248] It's about sharing the Bible God's Word.
[time=1252] In addition to this broadcast, another way that we can share God's Word with you is through some excellent Christian literature.
[time=1260] And today I want to share with you one of my favorite pieces of Bible study help, timeless insights.
[time=1266] You've watched the Bible hour before you've seen this, but if you haven't written, let me encourage you to write today for timeless insights.
[time=1274] This Bible study tool will take you through the entire New Testament systematically reading from Matthew through Revelation in one year's time.
[time=1282] I'll bet that most of you have not read the entire New Testament.
[time=1288] You've probably read your favorite passages over and over again, and that's fine, but you're missing some of the treasure that God has for you.
[time=1296] Wouldn't it be great to one year from today to say I've read the entire New Testament?
[time=1300] I've not only read it, I've had a tool that's helped me to understand it.
[time=1304] We'd like to send you a copy, absolutely free if you'll just write to us today and ask for timeless insights.
[time=1310] If you'd like to receive your copy of timeless insights right to the Bible hour,
[time=1316] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1322] Once again, the address is the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1330] Thank you, Pete, and thank you again for joining us today.
[time=1352] Joy, that's high enough to be clean and pure.
[time=1360] And peace, that offers hope to a troubled mind.
[time=1368] We're all nations, joining us to await His times, with goodness shining through to the laws.
[time=1382] Faith that stands no matter how great the cause, and weakness born of grace from a life
[time=1396] restored, waiting in the love of the Lord.
[time=1412] No, that's deep enough to endure.
[time=1420] Joy, that's high enough to be clean and pure.
[time=1426] And peace, that offers hope to a troubled mind.
[time=1436] Patience strong enough to await His times, with goodness shining through to the laws.
[time=1450] Faith that stands no matter how great the cause, and weakness born of grace from a life
[time=1464] restored, waiting in the love of the Lord.
[time=1494] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1498] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1500] Obviously, today is Mother's Day, and many of us have family traditions.
[time=1506] Many of you are visiting your children here at our church, and we welcome you particularly.
[time=1512] Today, we want to thank God for the gifts that He's given to us in life, and none more precious than the gift of our family and mothers in particular.
[time=1520] Would you bow together as we pray?
[time=1524] God, we are thankful today for the privilege of knowing you and all of the blessings in life that you give us.
[time=1532] Father, we are so thankful for our families, particularly those of us who have had godly mothers,
[time=1538] and we particularly want to thank you for them.
[time=1542] Father, today, we pray that they will sense from our very actions on our specific words
[time=1548] that we love them.
[time=1550] We pray that you will give to each woman today a sense of worth, whether she's a mother or not,
[time=1556] but then their femininity, the way you have created her, unique from males, that she has great value.
[time=1564] May she sense her worth before you and her contributions to this world.
[time=1568] Father, today, as men, give us a perspective to place value and to treasure our wives, our mothers, our sister,
[time=1580] the women who are the strength of our family.
[time=1584] God, we give you thanks and ask for insight to give and show appreciation to them.
[time=1592] Father, today, while many of us are rejoicing, we pray that you in particular would comfort those who today rest under a cloud,
[time=1604] those who have lost loved ones in recent days, perhaps even their mother.
[time=1610] And we pray for those who today sit around a table and there's an empty chair because they have lost a member of that family.
[time=1618] We pray for the family of Dean Lockwood and Dean Jump.
[time=1624] As these families now face their future without the one they have loved, God, we ask you as the one who gives comfort to comfort them.
[time=1634] Father, we pray for those who are fighting for their health, even at this very moment, for a Dorothy Graham.
[time=1640] We would also pray for Jean Newen Swander and others today who need to know of your healing touch.
[time=1648] Father, we would pray today that you would heal some damaged relationships.
[time=1654] Perhaps by the sensitivity of the day, Mother's Day, there would be some who would soften their heart,
[time=1660] and like a prodigal son or daughter, come home.
[time=1666] God, we pray there might be healing even this day. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
[time=1696] Jesus came with His arms open wide. With His arms open wide. He gave sight to the blinded. If in Him, they'd abide. With strong carpenters hands.
[time=1722] He remolded mankind. Jesus lived with His arms open wide.
[time=1732] With His arms open wide. He was nailed to a tree. With His arms open wide. He redeemed you and me.
[time=1746] And as His last breath was heard throughout eternity, Jesus died with His arms open wide.
[time=1758] With His arms open wide. With His arms open wide. He brought life to a lost world. With His arms open wide.
[time=1772] He created a circle that holds all of mankind. And within that great circle stands His word for all time.
[time=1784] He said, "Love, love, love one another. Take the hand of your brother with your arms open wide.
[time=1798] And as we become that circle, reaching all of mankind, He'll return with His arms open wide.
[time=1810] He'll return with His arms open wide.
[time=1842] Thank you, Brian. We really hope that you know, not only by a song, but by your own personal experience, that when Christ died on the cross with His arms open wide, they were open so that He might embrace you.
[time=1856] And He's coming again. And you can be prepared for entrance into His eternal kingdom all because of what He's done for you. His arms are open wide.
[time=1868] If you stepped up and said, "Jesus, take me. I take you to be my Savior." If you never have, today would be the great day to say yes to Christ.
[time=1880] Thanks for being a part of our ministry today. We want to invite you to open your Bibles and study with us now from Proverbs.
[time=1888] We're looking at an appropriate theme because it's Mother's Day. We're going to look at what the Book of Proverbs has to say about being a lady, a wife, and a mother.
[time=1898] Turn if you will to start us off to Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 22.
[time=1906] In the society in which Solomon lived, there were very, very few single people. Marriages were not developed based upon romance.
[time=1918] Often they were contractual agreements, not between a man and a woman, but between your parents. They'd make an arrangement for you.
[time=1926] And a lady was usually, first of all, just that, a lady. Secondly, she was a wife, and finally she was a mother. That was sort of the tradition there.
[time=1936] There were very few single men or single women, and tragedy was considered to be childless.
[time=1942] So in the Book of Proverbs, all of those themes are rolled together. Being a wife, a mother, and a woman, it's more of a composite look at what a woman is in the scriptures.
[time=1952] Proverbs 18, verse 22 says, "He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord."
[time=1966] I have heard people debate this verse, but it stands clear. He who finds a wife finds a good thing.
[time=1974] Socrates says, "If a man marries, it is a good thing. For if he marries a good woman, he will be happy all his life. And if he does not, he will become a philosopher, and that's good too."
[time=1988] Well, Solomon was a little bit more generous here. He simply said that the relationship of a husband to a wife and the whole institution of a family in all, it's a good thing.
[time=2000] All of us have lived through days of immense transition about the role of women in society. A lot has changed, and I want to say much of it for the good, particularly as it relates to the fact that women deserve equal pay and meritorious pay when they do the job that a man does.
[time=2018] I think that's important. I also think that within that larger movement, sometimes we confuse ourselves and confuse the roles.
[time=2028] The women's movement is upon us. Helen Reddy put in the words and gave it a dynamic force, "I am woman, hear me roar in numbers too big to ignore."
[time=2040] And there became an explosive movement, almost hostile. And with that movement came a lot of changes, some of it very good, some of it unfortunately, not so good.
[time=2054] As time changes, it really becomes our job to say, "What are those values that don't change?"
[time=2062] I believe the book of Proverbs gives us three qualities, not just for women, but we'll take them out of the context when he speaks about women, but these fit men just as well.
[time=2072] So please don't feel like we're picking on you exclusively, ladies. We do not intend to do that.
[time=2078] Proverbs is a book of sharp contrast. So with each of these qualities, and three of them we're going to share with you, there comes a counterpart that is a negative somewhere along the way.
[time=2090] The first one I would like to give you is found in Proverbs 12, verse 4.
[time=2100] It reads, "A wife of noble character is her husband's crown, but a disgraceful wife is like the K to the bones."
[time=2114] Now we're going to come back to this, but this same phrase, "A noble wife," is found in the last chapter of Proverbs, chapter 31, where it reads with a lengthy passage starting with verse 10, "A wife of noble character, who can find?"
[time=2134] The Bible is placing a premium on being a woman of character. It says, "A woman of noble character, who can find such a one, is like finding rubies."
[time=2144] We have literally torn our backyard apart. We've put in railroad ties, and we've got a garden on this side and new grass on that side.
[time=2152] We've dug about 11 different postholes to put up a little privacy fence and extend the patio with a wood deck, and I've dug in every part of that backyard. I haven't found a ruby yet.
[time=2164] Those rascals are hard to find. Anybody else find a ruby lately? Don't find those too often. They're precious. They're very rare.
[time=2174] That's how valuable a woman of noble character is. Back in chapter 12, verse 4, Solomon helps us to picture that he says, "A woman of noble character is her husband's crown."
[time=2188] I'll be honest with you, I'm kind of crownless in life. I don't have a crown. Solomon had many crowns. This wasn't just a figure of speech for him.
[time=2198] This guy could go to the closet, and he had the crown as the king over all of Israel. It was right there. It was real. Made of precious metals and probably inlaid with precious gems, just like a ruby.
[time=2210] He also had several other crowns because he had extended his empire over quite a few other kingdoms, and he was now their king.
[time=2220] But when he looked at the real crown of life, he said, "It's not those made with gold or silver, and inlaid with jewels."
[time=2228] Solomon said, "The real crown of life." I do have one of those. It's my dear wife, Kathy. A woman of noble character. That's a husband's crown.
[time=2242] That's something for him that gives him a sense of regleness, stateliness in his life, because not her beauty, although I'm fortunate that I feel my wife is beautiful, but it's talking about beauty of character.
[time=2260] That is a woman of worth. To begin with, the first quality that Proverbs places as a timeless quality for women and men is a woman of spiritual character.
[time=2276] I like what it says at the end of Proverbs 31. I never understood that until this week. Verse 30 says, "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."
[time=2292] That's that spiritual character. Now listen to this. Men, here comes our job. It says, "Give her the reward she has earned." Donna Summer said, "She worked hard for her money."
[time=2304] Okay, what's the reward that she's earned? It says, "Let her works bring her praise at the city gate."
[time=2314] Now, you know what the greatest reward that you could give as a man to your mother or to your wife? It's not the credit card. It is your own praise.
[time=2326] To hear you say, "I love you. I appreciate you. I admire how you do it. I thank God I have a full-time job in your home with these three kids. Bless you."
[time=2338] It says, "Give her her praise." Many of you meet me and I meet regularly with people at our church at 6.30 in the morning. Two reasons. I'm a morning person and it fits your schedule.
[time=2352] Secondly, I don't want to be at home between 6.30 and 8 o'clock in the morning.
[time=2358] Let's recognize the fact that what women do is worthy of praise.
[time=2364] I saw on television, I know many of you saw a movie called "Mr. Mom." I think everybody ought to see that film unless there's bad language and then watch it on TV. That's where I saw it.
[time=2376] But this movie is fantastic. It helps us as men to see that phrases like, "Do you work or do you just stay at home?" are reasons for capital punishment.
[time=2388] The greatest scene in this film, this man's wife has gone to work. He is jobless, so he's going to take care of the kids.
[time=2396] Well, his little baby did what little babies do after math of eating. He didn't have all the necessary equipment to restore things just in the right order.
[time=2408] He's trying to clean up this little baby in a bathroom. It's not one of those restrooms that have paper towels.
[time=2416] It's the kind where you hit the button and you're in the hot air. So he's holding this little baby's bare bottom. He's blow-drying the kid.
[time=2422] I've never done that. I just pulled the kids' pants back up wet. I wasn't smart enough to.
[time=2430] Hey, that's not easy stuff. Taking care of little kids, big kids, it says recognize they have worth, but here's the phrase that I really like.
[time=2440] It says this, "Give her her reward." That's your recognition and appreciation. It says, "Let her works, bring her praise at the city gates."
[time=2448] Now, what does that mean? Let it bring her praise at the city gates. Well, the gate of a city had a lot of different functions.
[time=2456] First of all, it was the gate into the city. You didn't know that because you haven't studied Hebrew, but it was the gate into the city.
[time=2464] But more than the gate in the city, it was also kind of the appellate court. If you didn't like the way your neighbor took care of his property, you could go there and complain.
[time=2472] It was kind of a commercial center, but more than anything else, it was kind of a place where the boys gathered.
[time=2480] It was in the early days the equivalent to the Kiwanas and the rotary.
[time=2486] It was before judges ruled that women had to be led into rotary. This was just the place where the men of the city went to talk.
[time=2496] They talked about their golf score. They talked about fishing. They talked about politics. Just kind of the guys were there.
[time=2504] Now, what Proverbs 31 is saying, when you go to those spots, men, make sure you're talking about what a great wife you have.
[time=2516] Let her be praised in the gates of the city. When you're there with the men, don't be the one that always has a depreciating joke about women.
[time=2528] Be the one that says, "I don't know what your wife is like." But mine's not like that. She is special. I can't wait to get home.
[time=2538] Matter of fact, I think I'm going to go now and see you here tomorrow. That's what it's basically saying there. Let her be praised.
[time=2546] Why? Because she's a woman of spiritual character.
[time=2550] Today, let me just list off the qualities of Proverbs 31 very, very quickly for you. We've studied this before.
[time=2556] It is a great passage, and I've simply avoided it today because we've looked at it in the past.
[time=2562] But here are at least several qualities. Six that I've listed out of Proverbs 31 of a spiritual noble woman of character.
[time=2570] First of all, she's trusted. She is trustworthy. Secondly, she is diligent. Thirdly, she is disciplined.
[time=2580] Fourthly, she's industrious. Fifthly, she is fourth-sided and generous.
[time=2588] And finally, she is recognized as a woman of worth.
[time=2594] That list of Proverbs 31 and being a woman of character, that is a timeless quality.
[time=2602] That has nothing to do with modern technology or ancient archaeology. It is timeless.
[time=2608] It is always vogue with God to have a spiritual foundation in your life and develop those qualities.
[time=2618] But in our society, we aren't as concerned about character on the inside as what we appear to be on the outside.
[time=2628] There is a great pastor, Shadrach, Meshach, Lockridge in San Diego, California, who said,
[time=2634] "The problem with most of us as Christians is we are vogue on the outside and vague on the inside."
[time=2642] Proverbs is encouraging us as women and men alike to be less concerned about being vogue on the outside
[time=2652] and to clearly be people of substance on the inside, character rooted in the Lord.
[time=2658] The climax of Proverbs 31, it says, "A woman who fears the Lord is greatly to be honored."
[time=2668] Ladies, it's timeless. Men, it's genderless. They have spiritual character.
[time=2674] Now, in contrast to spiritual character, the good news, Solomon dwells extensively on the bad news.
[time=2682] And that is the opposite of a spiritual woman of character, and that is, in a word, the sensuous woman.
[time=2690] All the way through Proverbs, Proverbs is written from a man to men, from a father to his son, words of warning,
[time=2700] and one of the clearest and most consistent warnings that he gives is the warning to avoid the sensuous woman.
[time=2708] We meet her for the first time in Proverbs chapter 2, verse 16. Join me there, if you will.
[time=2714] Proverbs 2, list the values of memorizing God's word. I hope you're memorizing God's word.
[time=2720] Have you memorized a verse this week? I have. I've been working on a verse in Jude.
[time=2726] I like studying the Scripture, but I find studies not enough. You need to memorize it.
[time=2732] Memorizing God's word. What will that do for you if you hide it in your heart?
[time=2736] Chapter 2, verse 16. Yet, memorizing God's word will save you also from the adulterous,
[time=2746] from the wayward wife with her seductive words, who has left the partner of her youth
[time=2754] and ignored the covenant she made before God. For her house leads down to death,
[time=2760] and her paths to the spirit of the dead, none who go to her return or attain the paths of life.
[time=2770] Well, I can be said here, but let me just draw this first quality of the seductive woman.
[time=2776] She is the woman whose speech is flattering.
[time=2782] There are a number of differences, generally true of men and women, and allow me a vague stereotyping.
[time=2788] Women, for the most part, are sensitive and perceptive.
[time=2794] Men, what we say to them, lingers there for a long time.
[time=2800] They weigh our words and evaluate them. They really take him to heart and say,
[time=2806] "Did he really mean that, or was he just trying to talk his way out of something or into something?"
[time=2814] Men are not like that. We can be stepped on, treated, abused,
[time=2820] named called, used as a sucker by women, and as soon as she looks at us,
[time=2826] widens her eyes and says, "Oh, you are so strong and handsome."
[time=2832] We forget everything that has happened for the last months, and we say, "Just tell it to me one more time. You are so strong and handsome, and we believe it all,
[time=2842] and we fall prey." Many a woman has discovered that vulnerable Achilles heel in the male gender,
[time=2852] and they've discovered that flattery, if you're talking to a man, will get you just about everything.
[time=2860] It's one of the tools in the arsenal that the sensuous woman uses to manipulate men to follow her motive.
[time=2870] That's the first quality of a sensuous woman.
[time=2874] A second quality is developed even further in chapter 7, verse 10.
[time=2878] Chapter 7 deals exclusively with avoiding the affair.
[time=2884] It talks about the simple person, male, who unwittingly falls prey to the trap.
[time=2892] He walks in the wrong paths. He sets himself up, and he goes by her house, and then verse 10 says,
[time=2898] "Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute with crafty intent."
[time=2904] That's a harsh phrase, isn't it? Dressed like a prostitute.
[time=2908] But you know, in my young lifetime, I remember there were parts of Akron that when you drove through there,
[time=2914] those parts were obvious. Those three corners were known that that's where prostitutes would go.
[time=2922] And it was obvious by the way that they dressed and the seductiveness of their dress
[time=2928] and the exposure they gave to their body, they were saying, "Here I am, I'm for sale."
[time=2936] Now, you discover something. You can go back to that same town of Akron or any other town.
[time=2942] This one included. You discover something. You drive by the street corners, and everybody looks the same.
[time=2950] Everybody looks the same. You see, our society has said, if you're a woman, reveal it.
[time=2958] If you have a physical, attractive body, show it, use it. If you've got it, flaunt it.
[time=2966] You know what the Bible plays as a premium on? Modesty and discretion.
[time=2970] And don't ever think that modesty and discretion are somehow mutually exclusive of beauty.
[time=2980] You can be beautiful and be modest. You can be pretty and be discreet.
[time=2986] But this woman of Proverbs chapter 10 has discovered something.
[time=2992] If she says just the right things, she'll get the ear, and if she wears just the right thing, she'll get the eye.
[time=3000] And between her words and her physical display, she will get the attention that she so desperately wants.
[time=3012] That's the development of the sensuous woman. Chapter 9 takes it even little further.
[time=3016] Not only is her speech flattering and her dress sensuous, chapter 9 verse 13 is somewhat of a play on words
[time=3026] because the woman that's being described here is folly, the opposite of wisdom.
[time=3032] And so in some ways we're talking about folly, and yet it's a playback of a woman of that quality.
[time=3038] Verse 13. The woman folly is loud. She is undisciplined and without knowledge.
[time=3048] She sits at the door of her house on the seat at the highest point of the city, calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way.
[time=3060] "Let all who are simple come in here," she says to those who lack judgment.
[time=3068] Stolen water is sweet, and food eaten in secret is delicious. But little do they know that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of the grave.
[time=3086] Not only is she flattering in her speech, and not only is she seductive in her dress, but the sensuous woman then is also this.
[time=3094] She is domineering in her attitude. It says this. She is loud. That doesn't simply mean that her voice carries a little further than the next person.
[time=3102] It says that she is there loudly calling, "Hey, come here. Let me tell you how to do it. Follow me. I've got a plan."
[time=3112] She becomes manipulative, seductive, and domineering.
[time=3118] That's not attractive in men or in women. And then it says after that, life is out of control.
[time=3130] She is undisciplined, possessing no self-control and without knowledge, no insight, no common sense.
[time=3140] Proverbs is a book of sharp contrast. We, because we want to be vague, try to merge the two, and they don't fit together.
[time=3150] God puts a premium on the spiritual woman of noble character, and he says that woman, she's worth more than the best car, the finest home, or the most enviable job.
[time=3160] She is a crown. Be that, ladies. In the sensuous woman, she is a flatter. She is immodest. She is domineering and out of control.
[time=3178] Ladies' styles will change constantly. I remember the turmoil of the 60s as a student in high school, and ladies' dresses got shorter and shorter, and the miniskirt was in.
[time=3190] Then the 70s came in, and they got longer and longer and longer, and now they're getting shorter and shorter and shorter, and this too will pass.
[time=3198] But there's something timeless about the value of modesty and decency. It is always in style with God.
[time=3206] It will always honor a man who loves you. It will always honor the man who loves you.
[time=3216] Decency and modesty are always in order, but may I just say this brief corrective word, and particularly so, when it's an activity identified with the Lord, this church or our school, decency and modesty are essential.
[time=3234] Last, the first contrast, the spiritual woman and the sensuous one, and we had 32 minutes today, and now we have four minutes for the last two.
[time=3242] Very quickly, the second comparison is between the woman who is prudent and the woman who is indiscreet.
[time=3252] It says in Proverbs 1914, "Houses and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the Lord."
[time=3260] I confess to you, I didn't know what the word prudent meant until this week. Let me tell you what I thought prudent meant.
[time=3266] Prudence sounds like prunes, doesn't it?
[time=3270] And I pictured a prude was an older lady whose face looked a lot like a prune, and who was equally as tasteful.
[time=3282] And I always heard people say, "Don't be an old prune." I always say, "I don't want to be an old prune either."
[time=3288] But you know, that's a good word. I've discussed. I looked this up in Hebrew and dug through all these things.
[time=3294] Let me give you some synonyms for this word prudent. It means insightful. It's a word that implies common sense.
[time=3306] It's a word that means knowledge. It's a word that means somebody with discretion and intelligent.
[time=3314] Suddenly, I'd like to be called a prude. That's a good word.
[time=3318] Here, Proverbs says that prudence is a value that God places high on his list.
[time=3328] So I trace this word prudence, although the word prudence doesn't occur very often in your English Proverbs.
[time=3334] The same Hebrew word does, and I want to give you four qualities of a prude today.
[time=3340] First one, and I'll just give you these very quickly, Proverbs 16.20 says, "Someone who is prudent is teachable." Our human nature is to be defensive and to push others away, and to resent that they're suggesting that we might not be perfect.
[time=3356] But a wise, insightful, intelligent, prudent person is teachable.
[time=3364] Second thing that a prudent person is, is a prudent person knows the value of work.
[time=3370] We live in a time when quite a few of us have enough economic resources
[time=3376] that we can give our kids everything they need and everything they don't need as well.
[time=3380] And one of the things they need that we tend to fail to give them
[time=3386] is a healthy respect for the labor and work ethic.
[time=3392] Proverbs 10, reads like this, "He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son,
[time=3400] and he who sleeps during harvest is a disgrace, full son.
[time=3406] He who gathers crops in summer is a wise or a prudent son.
[time=3412] He's learned the labor has value. He's not afraid of hard work.
[time=3418] Third quality of a prudent person in proverbs is they have learned the value of saving and managing resources. It says they gather the crops in the summer.
[time=3428] That is implicing, implying that they take now because you cannot harvest
[time=3434] in the winter and they store it up and they save it and they manage it
[time=3440] to last the whole year long. A prudent person is someone that knows the value of a dollar, not just what it can buy, but how to manage it and save it.
[time=3450] Finally, a prudent person is a person who guards their words.
[time=3454] Proverbs 10, verse 19 tells us of this prudent person.
[time=3460] New international version reads, "When words are many, sin is not absent."
[time=3468] You know, there's a danger. When we lack insight and prudence and wisdom, we talk too much.
[time=3474] You know, sometimes we need to be warned. Maybe we haven't gossip.
[time=3478] Maybe we haven't lied. Maybe we haven't said anything that's wrong.
[time=3482] We've just said too much. You know the old expression.
[time=3486] It is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought of as a fool than to open it
[time=3494] and remove all doubt. That's what he's saying here.
[time=3500] A prudent and wise person recognizes that you can say too much.
[time=3504] We've been sharing with you this morning the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=3518] The music prepared by Marsha Ives, Brian Lowson, the Black Hawk Singers in our sanctuary choir, and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3526] Sharing Jesus Christ and his saving power is one of the most important aspects, in fact the most important aspects of the Bible hour.
[time=3534] If you'd like to receive Christ as your Savior before we close, would you bow and pray this prayer with me?
[time=3540] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3548] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3550] I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3554] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3560] If you prayed with me today, I hope that you'll write us and tell us the nature of the decision you made.
[time=3564] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
