[time=0] (bell chimes)
[time=112] The problem with so many of us is this.
[time=115] We stop looking for work as soon as we find a job.
[time=120] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=137] Rick's message today is entitled "Biblical Economics 2, Making Money the Old Fashion Way."
[time=143] The value of working and working hard is the theme of this second study in Biblical economics
[time=149] from the book of Proverbs, the Bible often warns against the consequences of laziness
[time=155] and admonishes us to be diligent.
[time=158] That is the theme of today's message entitled "Making Money the Old Fashion Way, Earning It." Please locate your Bible so that you are able to study along with us.
[time=169] Our sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=174] We will also hear special music from our own handbell choir, a dramatic reading from the
[time=181] Black Hawk Christian Schools drama class, a solo from Crystal Hull, and a song from the
[time=190] Men's Singers Quartet.
[time=193] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=202] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=207] Now here's Rick.
[time=208] He's given us the privilege of worshiping him.
[time=211] We want to welcome you to our morning worship service as we've come to praise the Lord together and also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=221] Our very purpose for worshiping is to crown Jesus Christ as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=228] To magnify his name and to praise him.
[time=231] Thank you for joining us.
[time=232] We hope that your heart is lifted up as our choir sings a medley of songs crescendoing
[time=238] with crown him with many crowns.
[time=243] He is risen; He is risen; He is risen; He is risen; He is risen; He is risen; He is risen
[time=514] He is risen; He is risen; he is risen; He is risen; he is risen;
[time=534] What a privilege it is to come every Sunday morning and say that we serve a risen Savior.
[time=542] He is in the world today and I know that He is living. Let's continue to worship the king of kings
[time=548] and Lord of lords as we sing him number 11. We'll sing the first, second, and fourth
[time=555] stands us together of all worship the king.
[time=567] Worship the king of warriors of God, who make what we see is power and is law.
[time=581] We remember we ain't turned on days, but we're not in sweat, but we're in good ways.
[time=597] We'll sing our verses, we'll sing our verses, we'll sing them from that body, from the floor,
[time=617] and our Jesus, man, of the age of the soul.
[time=627] We'll get a cross and behold and a sin, when we do we trust, for our need to live.
[time=641] [MUSIC]
[time=660] Thank you again for your good singing. How we really appreciate the ministry of our volunteer folks.
[time=667] We work in many aspects of our church and now in particular in the music area.
[time=672] We thank the Lord for Rich Littiki and his ability to direct.
[time=676] Thank the Lord for all the ladies that are involved in the handbell choir.
[time=680] We appreciate their ministry. Let's listen to them now as they play a song for us entitled "Canticle or Song of Praise."
[time=695] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=930] [APPLAUSE]
[time=940] It's very customary for all of us when we gather together just before we come out for the service to pray and ask God's blessing on the service and allow the people to be ministered to through our music.
[time=951] But in this case today with Rich he shared with me that that was probably the most difficult song that the handbell choir had played.
[time=958] And I just am thankful that not only do we give God the glory but we're thankful for people that work hard throughout the week every week practicing and then want to do a job that honors the Lord through their particular ministry and we're glad for that.
[time=972] From time to time at the Black Hawk Christian School there are programs to which friends and family are invited and when we have such programs there are special groups from the school that perform for us.
[time=983] Just a few weeks ago we had such an occasion where the speech class from the school presented a choral reading entitled Jonah.
[time=991] Let's listen as they repeat that for us today the story of Jonah.
[time=996] The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amatide.
[time=1001] Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me.
[time=1008] But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarsus.
[time=1013] He went down to Challa where he found the ship down for that port.
[time=1017] After paying the fare he went to the Lord and sailed for Tarsus to flee from the Lord.
[time=1024] Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up.
[time=1032] All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own God and it threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
[time=1040] But Jonah had gone below death where he laid down and fell to a deep sleep.
[time=1047] The captain went to him and said, "How can you sleep? Get up and call on your God.
[time=1052] Maybe he will notice us and we will not perish." Then the sailors said to each other, "Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity."
[time=1063] They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah. So they asked him, "Tell us who is responsible for making all this trouble for us."
[time=1074] I am a Hebrew and I worship the Lord, the God of Heaven who made the sea and the land.
[time=1080] This terrified them and they asked, "What have you done?" They knew he was running away from the Lord because he had already told himself.
[time=1089] The sea was getting rougher and rougher, so they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?
[time=1098] Pick me up and throw me into the sea and it will become calm.
[time=1102] I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you." Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard and the raging sea grew calm.
[time=1114] At this, the man greatly feared the Lord and they offered his sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to him.
[time=1122] The Lord provided a great fish to swallow Jonah and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.
[time=1137] From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God. He said, "In mighty stress, I called to the Lord and he answered me. From the depths of the grave, I called for help and you listened to my cry.
[time=1151] You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me.
[time=1157] All your waves and breakers swept over me. I have been banished from your sight, yet I will look again towards your holy temple.
[time=1166] In golfing waters threatened me. The deep surrounded me. Sea lead was wrapped around my head.
[time=1172] To the roots of the mountains, I sank down. The earth beneath barred me in forever.
[time=1178] I have even brought my life up from the pit, O Lord, my God.
[time=1182] When my life was heading away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.
[time=1190] Those who gleamed toward the vitals, forfeit the grace that could be theirs.
[time=1195] But I, with the song of Thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you.
[time=1200] What I have bowed, I will make good. Salvation comes from the Lord.
[time=1205] And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
[time=1212] Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.
[time=1222] Go to the great city of Nineveh, and proclaim to it the message I give to you.
[time=1228] Jonah made the word of the Lord, and went to Nineveh.
[time=1232] But you brought my life up from the pit, O Lord, my God.
[time=1237] Salvation comes from the Lord.
[time=1249] We want to thank you for joining us again today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1254] We sincerely hope that the time we spend together today by way of television is a strength and encouragement to your spiritual life.
[time=1263] We have not only this morning service to share with you, but a number of special events coming up in the life of our church, and we would certainly like to include you.
[time=1272] Probably the highlight of the summer, though, Pete has got to be the patriotic panorama.
[time=1277] Yes, Rick, we're already working on that, and that's a highlight, not only because of the celebration that we have for our own country, but again, it's another musical event where we have the opportunity to bring in some of our Bible Hour friends who come to join us.
[time=1291] And I hope that you'll take the time to set aside Sunday afternoon June 28th for our annual patriotic panorama.
[time=1299] The date is June 28th, and we'll have programs at five o'clock and eight o'clock.
[time=1303] Rick, it's a ticketed program, but the tickets are free, and you can ask for them by calling the church office or coming to the church and receiving those tickets.
[time=1313] Our guest this year is Carla Worley.
[time=1315] She's an outstanding soprano, has a beautiful, beautiful voice.
[time=1319] She'll be singing alone, and then the choir.
[time=1321] Our own sanctuary choir will be singing and backing her up on some numbers.
[time=1325] There'll be also some other individuals that will be participating in the program.
[time=1329] Looking forward to that, God has richly blessed this country, and to take a day, set it aside to say, "God, thank you for America, and to praise Him for what He's done for our country is probably the most worthy way we could spend a day of this summer." And it would be great if you would make a special effort and come and join us on the 28th for either the five or the eight o'clock concert.
[time=1353] Also coming up this summer is our summer Bible Conference.
[time=1356] I want to encourage you to save the Thursday nights of this summer, beginning with June the 4th, and throughout the whole summer, we will be having some of the greatest Bible teaching you'll be able to find anywhere.
[time=1368] We're going to have Bill Hybels here on June the 11th.
[time=1372] Bill's name is not quite as well known, but he's becoming quite famous.
[time=1376] About a week ago he was on Dr. Dobson's show.
[time=1379] Just about ten or eleven years ago, Bill started a church.
[time=1383] God has used it in a mighty way.
[time=1385] There were no people there twelve years ago.
[time=1387] Today there'll be about nine or ten thousand people there worshiping the Lord.
[time=1392] Bill is a great leader and an inspirational teacher.
[time=1395] We'll also be having Dr. David Burnham here this summer.
[time=1398] Again that may not be a name quite familiar to you.
[time=1402] David was the pastor first of the Chapel and University Park where there were eight thousand members and then a Bible town community church in Boca Raton, Florida.
[time=1410] Dave has a special place in my heart because he not only was the man that led me to Christ, but he was my mentor and example in the ministry.
[time=1418] I'm looking forward to sharing his ministry with you this summer.
[time=1422] So please save your Thursday nights for the summer Bible Conference.
[time=1426] And then on June the 4th we have eternity.
[time=1428] We have kind of a tradition Thursday night there between our normal Wednesday night activities that we have during the year, and then the Bible Conference.
[time=1435] And on June 4th, that again is a Thursday evening.
[time=1438] We'll be having eternity.
[time=1440] That's a group of young people, singers and instrumentalists.
[time=1443] We've had them here before.
[time=1444] They're a bit contemporary, but we like a variety of music.
[time=1447] If you don't particularly like one week, stay a week and come back and perhaps there'll be some variety for you.
[time=1453] So this is some good variety.
[time=1454] I think it'll be great.
[time=1455] They are good musicians and they love the Lord.
[time=1458] It'll be on the contemporary side, but it'll be good.
[time=1461] Pete, you just talked about the value of music and the diversity of it, and I certainly agree with that.
[time=1466] Looking forward to eternity being here in the early summer and then Bert Kettinger a little later in the month of July.
[time=1472] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to encourage you to be studying God's Word on a regular, daily basis.
[time=1482] One person once said, "This book, speaking of the Bible, this book will keep you from sin, and sin will keep you from this book."
[time=1492] Our greatest encouragement to you today and every day is to study the scriptures and to help you along in that adventure.
[time=1500] We offer timeless insights, a daily Bible study tool that helps you to systematically, appropriately study the entire New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1511] It requires from you simply reading a chapter or maybe a chapter and a half if it's a short chapter of the New Testament, and then it gives you some practical ways to apply what you've just read to your own life.
[time=1523] That application is so important.
[time=1525] Someone once said, "It might have been Bill Gather.
[time=1527] I know he's saying it.
[time=1528] I hear you've been getting into the Word, but is the Word getting into you?" That's application.
[time=1534] Timeless Insights will help you do that.
[time=1536] If you'll write today, we'll send you your first copy free.
[time=1540] If you'd like to receive timeless insights right to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1550] Once again, the address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1558] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1559] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1561] I'm looking forward to studying through the Scriptures with you again on this theme of biblical economics today, making money the old-fashioned way, earning it.
[time=1571] If you don't have a copy of the Scriptures next to you, if there's one close by, get it now, and we'll study together.
[time=1580] [MUSIC] No other song of heaven [MUSIC] But that of Jesus [MUSIC] The Son of God [MUSIC] Who came to seek and save [MUSIC] Who paid the price for pardon [MUSIC] And redemption [MUSIC] When all the cross [MUSIC] Is lively freely gave [MUSIC] No other song [MUSIC] Can I to sing [MUSIC] But Jesus [MUSIC] No other thing [MUSIC] But Christ and covering [MUSIC] In every glory free [MUSIC] I would be telling [MUSIC] The wonders of [MUSIC] Is much less love for me [MUSIC]
[time=1674] [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=1762] Thank you, Crystal.
[time=1765] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1768] God said in Psalms that He would give a new song in our heart, a song that we could sing, a song that would transform our very lives.
[time=1779] God, we would ask today that you would make us to hear the music, all of us to hear the harmony and the rhythm of your song, that we might praise you, not just with the words that we speak today,
[time=1794] because it's Sunday, but that we might praise you by the very walk of our life.
[time=1800] Father, we ask you to give us that song.
[time=1804] We also ask you to give comfort today to those who are suffering, particularly to the Thurston family and the loss of their little baby and to the Bowser's in the tragic loss of their child that was soon to be born.
[time=1820] We ask you to comfort Marv Degitz and his long battle for health.
[time=1826] We ask you to comfort those who are battling today with enemies like heart attack or cancer.
[time=1834] Father, we would ask you to help us to battle our spiritual enemies as well,
[time=1840] apathy and complacency, anger and resentment.
[time=1846] Help us, Father, to double our commitment and to minimize our fault finding.
[time=1852] God, give us, as a body of people, a healing spirit and an excited spirit,
[time=1859] a spirit of anticipation looking for the Lord Jesus to come.
[time=1864] Father, we pray today that our hearts will be watching, waiting and working
[time=1872] until Jesus comes, until the day when we shall behold him.
[time=1894] Preparing his entrance, the star shall upon him with thunders of praise.
[time=1918] Sweetlight, his arms shall enhance those of redeem.
[time=1932] And we shall behold him, then face to face.
[time=1947] We shall behold him, we shall behold him, face to face in all of his glory.
[time=1973] Now we shall behold him, we shall behold him, then face to face
[time=1997] our Savior and Lord.
[time=2011] [AMEN]
[time=2017] We shall, we shall behold him, then face to face in all of his glory.
[time=2031] The sleeping shall rise from the slumbering flames and those who remain.
[time=2054] Shall be changed in all of his glory, then face to face.
[time=2076] We shall behold him, then face to face in all of his glory.
[time=2103] We shall behold him, we shall behold him, then face to face our Savior and Lord.
[time=2132] We shall behold him, then face to face in all of his glory.
[time=2158] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2166] Thank you, men.
[time=2167] Music has that ability to take us from just about any mood and to lift us up and give energy to tired bodies.
[time=2177] And yet it's not just music, there has to be content.
[time=2180] And how clear the content that Jesus Christ is coming again.
[time=2184] More than anything else, we hope that you know not only these coming back, but that you know him so that when he comes he'll say,
[time=2191] "I knew you," and you belong to him.
[time=2194] That's the very purpose of our meeting today, is to study the Scriptures, to know Christ, and then to know his will, his plan for our life.
[time=2203] And so we're studying the book of Proverbs as a church. Proverbs is proverbial.
[time=2208] That means it is timeless wisdom that God has for us on some very basic practical levels.
[time=2215] We're studying through Proverbs, it's very topical in its nature, and our larger topic right now is biblical economics.
[time=2223] And today we're looking at the value of work.
[time=2227] If you have a Bible open at the Proverbs, Proverbs is about the middle of the Bible, unless you have lots of stuff at the end of your Bible,
[time=2236] concordances and maps, and three months worth of bulletins, but if you just have a Bible, it's about in the middle.
[time=2243] If you can find the book of Psalms, it's the next book after that.
[time=2247] We're in chapter 24 as a starting place today.
[time=2250] Here's what chapter 24, verse 30 says in a modern translation, the new international version.
[time=2257] Proverbs 24, verse 30.
[time=2260] I went past the field of the sluggered, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment.
[time=2267] Forged it come up everywhere.
[time=2270] The ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins.
[time=2276] I applied my heart to what I observed, and learned a lesson from what I saw.
[time=2283] A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands, to rest.
[time=2295] And poverty will come on you like a bandit, and scarcity like an armed man.
[time=2305] Probably many of you are like me when you turn on the television set, you enjoy the commercials more than you do, the broadcast shows.
[time=2313] One of my favorites is the Smith Barney commercial.
[time=2317] I believe the actor's name is John Houseman.
[time=2320] He is very British, very condescending in his tone, and he says Smith Barney makes money the old fashioned way.
[time=2331] They earn it.
[time=2335] There's something both annoying and attractive about the way he says they earn it.
[time=2341] It drives home a point though, doesn't it?
[time=2344] We as a society are in a static love affair with money, and there are very few ways you can have money.
[time=2355] The first way you can have money is to inherit it.
[time=2358] Now there's some bad things about inheriting money, the chief of which is somebody has to die usually for you to get it.
[time=2366] A man wrote out his will, and upon his death he left a large endowment to his church.
[time=2373] As the pastor was greeting people at the door, asking everyone how they were, this man said unfortunately for you I'm doing quite well.
[time=2383] Inheriting money has an inherent problem, somebody has to die for you to get it.
[time=2387] The second inherent danger of inherited money is this.
[time=2392] Usually the easier money comes, the easier it goes, and we tend not to do very well with inherited money.
[time=2400] Well there's a second way of making money as well as inheriting it, and that is to steal it.
[time=2407] That also has some inherent dangers.
[time=2410] First of all it will be greatly missed by the person from whom you took it, and secondly you will be greatly missed by your family as you spend time in prison.
[time=2420] So that's not a real good way to go either.
[time=2423] There is a third way that you can make money, and that is to invest it and have a return on your investment, but unfortunately you can't invest what you don't have, so investment is only a secondary way of making money.
[time=2439] So you just say I'm going to make my money on investments if you don't have any isn't going to work.
[time=2444] Reminds me of my third grade teacher, both of them.
[time=2450] Every time I asked how to spell word you know what they told me, look it up in the dictionary.
[time=2455] I said but you have to know how to spell it to look it up in the dictionary.
[time=2459] You have to have a little bit to start with.
[time=2462] There is a fourth way of making money, this Smith Barney way, and the reason why I find that commercial so attractive is because it's the biblical way, that is to work for it, to earn it.
[time=2475] The book of Proverbs has been rightly outlined by a man by the name of Dick Brusko, who says there are three different workers described in Proverbs, the diligent, the lazy, and the excessive.
[time=2491] Let me use that outline today and give you an overview of what the Bible says about these three workers.
[time=2497] First of all, the diligent worker.
[time=2499] The diligent worker is diligent, he recognizes three things.
[time=2503] First and foremost, the diligent worker recognizes work as God's basic plan of economy.
[time=2510] Here in chapter 24 we just read it, we see the slugger.
[time=2513] He doesn't want to work, he wants to lay down, he wants to rest, he wants to nap, he doesn't want to weed the garden, he doesn't want to tend the field, he doesn't want to repair the fences, he wants always to avoid work.
[time=2527] That is not God's economy.
[time=2530] In our society, we have this singular problem that most of us, the day we find a job we quit looking for work, we just want to put in our time.
[time=2542] And we're far more concerned about time off, pensions, vacations, retirements, personal days, family sickness days, personal illness days.
[time=2553] We are more concerned about what we have to do to get all of these benefits than we really are saying I'm going to give myself to this work.
[time=2563] You know, work is not a four letter word.
[time=2565] Now my third grade teacher reminded me that it is, but it's not a bad four letter word.
[time=2571] In fact, it is an excellent word.
[time=2574] When God created the world, and I do believe the creation account of Genesis, God created Adam and Eve, he placed them in a perfect world, physically, ecologically and spiritually, and you know what he told him to do?
[time=2591] Work, and he didn't have church work in mind.
[time=2596] I'm all for church work, don't misunderstand that.
[time=2601] But there was no evangelistic campaigns to be run.
[time=2605] There was no world to evangelize in terms of people.
[time=2608] And there was no sin.
[time=2610] The work that God had in mind was to take care of the Garden of Eden.
[time=2615] Any ordained work at the very beginning creation, Genesis 2, 15, and work has been a part of God's plan up till now.
[time=2623] And in the future, when we get to heaven, you know what we're going to do?
[time=2626] We're going to work.
[time=2628] We're going to serve the Lord.
[time=2630] God's made us to work.
[time=2632] There isn't anything wrong with it at all.
[time=2634] And a diligent worker recognizes that that's God's basic plan of economics.
[time=2640] Second thing, the diligent worker recognizes is this, working hard is a virtue.
[time=2649] Working hard is a virtue.
[time=2652] Proverbs 10, verse 4, reads like this.
[time=2658] And this morning, I'm going to move through quite a few verses and please feel free to listen and not look up verses or to follow me if your fingers are fast.
[time=2667] Proverbs 10, 4, lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.
[time=2674] One of the constant adverbs, excuse me, that's an adjective, of working is to be a diligent worker.
[time=2682] It's a virtue.
[time=2684] One particular man out of U.S. history said these words, "I am thankful that I was born and worked before the invention of the eight-hour day.
[time=2694] And I am thankful that I was never made to feel that I ought to slow down in my work because I should keep paces with my fellow workers.
[time=2705] For had I, I would have never accomplished as much as I have." That American worker was Thomas Alva Edison and he accomplished in his lifetime significant inventions that have transformed our society.
[time=2721] His applications of electricity into practical uses have revolutionized the world and he did it because he worked and he worked hard.
[time=2734] The third thing, and this is the good news, the diligent worker, he or she finally recognizes the rewards of labor.
[time=2743] There are rewards for working and working hard, at least these five.
[time=2748] The first is profit and plenty.
[time=2751] Chapter 12, verse 11 says, "He who works his land will have abundant food."
[time=2762] Verse 14, "From the fruit of his lips a man is filled with good things as surely as the work of his hands rewards him."
[time=2772] There are rewards for working hard, the first of which is profit and plenty.
[time=2781] There is a second reward, found in Proverbs chapter 2, 22, verse 29.
[time=2790] This is the reward of recognition.
[time=2793] Do you see a man skilled in his work?
[time=2796] He will serve before kings, he will not serve before obscure men.
[time=2802] This is saying if you work hard you'll not only get the reward financially of profit and of plenty, but you'll gain recognition.
[time=2810] If you work hard and you do good work, you'll receive recognition for that.
[time=2816] The book of Psalm says, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it!"
[time=2822] Implied, "Do it well!" Now you may be a homemaker and there may be jobs around your home that you love and others that you loathe.
[time=2834] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it and do it well.
[time=2838] You may be a student and you may say, "I don't like this job, do it and do it well."
[time=2845] You may say, "I'm just in the bottom of this corporate ladder, they don't even know that I exist."
[time=2851] Take your job and do it and do it well and in time you will be recognized.
[time=2861] One of the worst jobs a person could ever have is shoveling out a horse barn.
[time=2867] I know I have done that.
[time=2870] And you know it was while shoveling out a horse barn at our church's camp that a man said, "If you ever need a job, let me know."
[time=2881] You'll get recognized if you work hard, even if it's shoveling out a horse barn.
[time=2888] And you know what? It doesn't take a lot of skill.
[time=2893] I didn't even have my college degree and I was able to do that.
[time=2898] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it and do it well.
[time=2903] And you'll be recognized for that.
[time=2905] And after you're recognized, chapter 17, verse 2 tells us that the third reward is you'll be promoted.
[time=2912] It says, "A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers."
[time=2921] Or one of the sons.
[time=2923] Here's the picture. It's a wealthy landowner who has several sons and several servants.
[time=2930] The sons will inherit all their father-owns. The servants will be servants forever.
[time=2936] But if a servant works and he works hard, he will be recognized.
[time=2942] And if he applies himself with wisdom along with his work, he will be promoted to the point where he will be treated no longer as a servant.
[time=2950] He will be promoted to a par with the sons and he'll be treated like he's their brothers.
[time=2956] And he will share in their inheritance.
[time=2959] The best way to make it to the top is not to apply for it, but to earn it by working and working hard.
[time=2969] The fourth benefit or reward of hard work of being the diligent worker is this.
[time=2975] Leadership, chapter 12, verse 24 says, "Diligent hands will rule, but laziness ends in slavery."
[time=2986] We'll come back to this verse a second time. Just notice the first phrase of the parallel structure.
[time=2992] "Diligent hands will rule." The person who works hard is the person who will receive not only the promotion,
[time=3002] but the responsibility and authority on the job, and they will be the ones who will rule over the others.
[time=3009] If you want to be a leader, work hard.
[time=3012] The final reward is chapter 13, verse 4. It gives us the fifth reward.
[time=3019] The slugger craves and gets nothing, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied.
[time=3026] You know, there isn't anything more satisfying than something for which you have worked very, very hard.
[time=3035] You know, if you take any commodity, you name it.
[time=3039] It may be a suit of clothing. It may simply be a cold can of pop.
[time=3045] It may be a very fine car.
[time=3048] If you have that commodity given to you undeservedly, you will not cherish it or find it nearly as satisfying as if you had worked for it.
[time=3062] Because after you work for something, you now know the value, and when you know the value comes the satisfaction to the heart.
[time=3071] And it won't come any other way than to earn it.
[time=3077] Well, there's the benefits of being a diligent worker, five of them, profit and plenty, recognition, promotion, leadership, and satisfaction.
[time=3087] The only way you can get them is through working hard, so the diligent worker is commended.
[time=3093] Indira Gandhi said, "My grandfather told me there are two types of people in the world, those who do all the work and those who take all the credit.
[time=3103] My grandfather also told me she said, "Be even the first group.
[time=3108] The competition is not nearly as great.
[time=3111] Work and work hard." Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your posture, the book of Proverbs leaves us with that for the diligent worker and speaks very clearly and explicitly about the lazy worker.
[time=3126] Now, we're going to move very fast.
[time=3129] There are 12 things that I have found about a lazy worker.
[time=3133] In Machitian Gunfire, here they are.
[time=3135] The first is the lazy worker lacks common sense.
[time=3140] In chapter 6, verse 6, it says, "Look to the ant, oh sluggered, who has no one to roll over him yet works and works hard.
[time=3148] Give or watch the little ants." That's why we say, "Oh, he's working like a little ant." You knock over a little ant hill and you'll see all these little ants.
[time=3154] They're running and scurrying and cleaning up and making new paths and carrying little breadcrumbs bigger than they are.
[time=3160] And you know what?
[time=3161] There's no ants saying, "Hey, you two guys, get off your death.
[time=3163] Move over, you three, come on, let's go." I don't think there's any ants saying that, but they just do it.
[time=3169] Instinctively, they've got the ant sense to work.
[time=3175] And the lazy person doesn't even have the common sense.
[time=3179] The second characteristic or lack of character about the lazy person
[time=3185] is found in chapter 11, or chapter 12, verse 11.
[time=3189] "He who works his land will have abundant food." There's the profit and plenty, but he who chases fantasies lacks judgment.
[time=3201] A lazy person instead of working hard is a person who is given to fantasies
[time=3207] and schemes about getting rich.
[time=3210] They've always got a good investment and I'm going to cut you in early.
[time=3216] Watch out for those good investments.
[time=3219] All of us have an in-law or an outlaw who has got a big plan.
[time=3225] And since your family, they're going to let you in on the ground floor.
[time=3232] Wait till it is at least six stories high. The view is better on the seventh floor anyway.
[time=3240] Fantasies.
[time=3242] The lazy person always has some idea that imagine that doesn't require work on their part.
[time=3251] No.
[time=3253] Chapter 28, verse 19, tells us the same thing.
[time=3256] Third thing about the lazy worker is they talk about their plans.
[time=3260] Instead of working, they're constantly talking.
[time=3263] They go beyond their fantasies and they talk forever.
[time=3266] Chapter 14, verse 23.
[time=3270] All hard work leads to a profit.
[time=3274] That's the diligent workers reward again.
[time=3277] But mere talk leads only to poverty.
[time=3283] Talk is cheap.
[time=3288] You need to work and if you're an employer, you need to employ workers.
[time=3300] And with myself as the exception, you don't need to employ talkers.
[time=3306] Hard work pays.
[time=3309] Pastor Jeremiah took me on a speaking trip with him one time that was an excellent conference.
[time=3314] He benefited much by it and I was humored just as often.
[time=3318] We were standing after a meeting and a man that Dave knew came up to him, allergic to work.
[time=3325] It was written all over his face.
[time=3327] And he said, "Dave, you need to hire me to be on your staff."
[time=3333] Dave couldn't avoid snickering.
[time=3335] He said, "Well, Dennis, what on earth could you do?" He said, "I don't know, but you would be purchasing my fertile mind.
[time=3343] Neither of us could retain the laughter." This guy, he was a dreamer and a talker, but he was not a worker.
[time=3350] He was lazy.
[time=3351] The fourth quality is this.
[time=3353] Of the lazy worker, they manipulate others in trying to get rich for themselves.
[time=3359] Chapter 28, verse 20, it says this.
[time=3366] "A faithful man will be richly blessed.
[time=3369] Three wards of being a diligent worker, and one eager to get rich will not go unpunished."
[time=3375] Oh, wait a minute, why is punishment brought in?
[time=3378] Because you see, the person who's eager to get rich is always compromising integrity, trying to manipulate others, trying to get rich through the work of others.
[time=3387] No, don't do that.
[time=3389] The fifth thing is this.
[time=3394] The lazy worker, often, if not always, sees himself or herself as above that job.
[time=3403] Why?
[time=3404] My training.
[time=3405] My skills do not warrant such menial tasks.
[time=3409] There is no one in this room seated or standing.
[time=3413] Nothing personal to the cameraman right now.
[time=3416] None of us are above any job.
[time=3419] There is no job that you are above, nor am I, including shoveling out the horse barn.
[time=3428] How can I say that so authoritatively?
[time=3430] Well, the living Bible puts it this way, Proverbs 12-9.
[time=3434] People who think they are too big, excuse me, it says it in a paraphrased way.
[time=3442] Let me put it this way.
[time=3444] People who think they are too big to do a little job are perhaps too little to be asked to do
[time=3451] a big job.
[time=3454] And the best illustration is the Lord Jesus.
[time=3458] The king of glory inhabited humanity and he washed the feet of others.
[time=3470] If anything more humbling than to take the dirty, odorsiferous feet of men who have walked dry,
[time=3479] dirty roads and to wash them 24 feet, 12 pair.
[time=3486] If he could do that, there is no job that you or I could be asked to do that is unthinkable.
[time=3497] We are above nothing.
[time=3499] The lazy man always sees himself as above that.
[time=3504] The next quality, chapter 13 verse 4 of the lazy man is this, he has access.

[time=3543] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3550] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
