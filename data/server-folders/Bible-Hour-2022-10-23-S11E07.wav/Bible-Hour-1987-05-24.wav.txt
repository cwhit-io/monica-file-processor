[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] >> Some do not plan out of sheer laziness, brothers, it's a matter of simple ignorance, but if we fail to plan, we are planning to fail.
[time=113] >> Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled, "Biblical Economics 3."
[time=134] Planning one's time and resources is a constant theme of Proverbs. A wise man plans ahead, says chapter 13, verse 16.
[time=143] Planning takes time, effort, and hard work, and for that reason many of us fail to plan. However, the rewards are great, both financially and spiritually, for those who plan ahead.
[time=156] In the series on biblical economics, today's message addresses the issue of planning to fail by failing to plan. Please locate your Bibles and have it open to Proverbs chapter 6. We will be looking at verses 6 through 8.
[time=172] We will be hearing special music today from the Sanctuary Choir, Lynn Roll, Celebration, and Susan Toyrat. The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=195] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=200] [MUSIC]
[time=220] Thank you very much. You may be seated.
[time=225] We welcome you to our service today. We're glad that you're with us. If you're visiting with friends in the Fort Wayne area, welcome to the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=234] We give a special welcome to those of you that are watching in the Bible Hour. We trust that the entire day will be a blessing to you as we worship the Lord together.
[time=243] We ask you to join with us as we sing together, and pray earnestly as someone leads us in prayer, and then as Pastor Rick gives the message today, we pray that you'll listen. God's blessing will be on you as He preaches.
[time=257] We're in a little different configuration, but that's not too unusual at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, but we do have a musical tonight. Our children will be presenting the musical the attic.
[time=266] And it'll be an exciting, inspirational evening with a hundred kids up on our stage, reminiscing, dreaming about growing up. So I hope that you can come back with us tonight.
[time=277] I want to turn our attention now to the peace the Lord Jesus Christ gives us. These are difficult times, and some of you this weekend are remembering loved ones who are perhaps lost in one of the wars that the Americans have been involved in, or you've had some tragedy in your life.
[time=294] And it's a difficult time for you. At the same time, there can be peace in the midst of that storm. The word is shalom. Peace, I leave with you. The Father left us, but He said, I'll send you a comforter. That's the Holy Spirit. Let's listen as the choir sings for us shalom.
[time=324] [MUSIC]
[time=346] Peace, I leave with you. Peace, I live to you. Shalom, shalom, shalom, shalom. Peace, God of this world, ever given you. Shalom, shalom, shalom.
[time=374] Take this prayer, take this one, give the light your own.
[time=399] Come to heart, friends to love. Shalom, shalom, shalom.
[time=425] Oh, I know I'm going to cry and leave with you. Shalom, shalom, shalom.
[time=437] Give to the ones, give to them for time. Shalom, shalom, shalom, shalom. And when you dream, remember. And when you dream, recall.
[time=464] This is my body. This is my blood. I give one's for all.
[time=481] Peace, I live with you. Peace, I give to you. Shalom, shalom, shalom.
[time=496] Peace, God of this world, this have I given you. Shalom, shalom, shalom.
[time=509] Shalom, shalom, shalom.
[time=521] Shalom, shalom.
[time=539] It was a tragic death of part of Horatio Spafford's family that led him to write a song entitled It is Well with My Soul.
[time=556] Continuing this same theme of the piece that Jesus gives us, let's turn to him number 417 and we'll sing the first third and fourth stanzas of It is Well with My Soul.
[time=568] [MUSIC - 16 seconds]
[time=612] It is Well with My Soul.
[time=768] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=772] One of the great privileges of our church is the many people that God allows us to be in partnership with.
[time=780] We have over 40 different missionaries we support and we feel a kinship to each of them, but especially so to those who have been a part of our church.
[time=790] Mary Cruz is one of those people.
[time=792] She has been serving the Lord with Send International in Japan.
[time=795] She actually grew up there as the child of a missionary couple.
[time=799] God laid it on her heart to take that awareness of need and also experience of culture and language and to go back.
[time=806] Kathy and I had the privilege of visiting Mary in Kofu and she's going to be leaving us now having been here for on and off for the last year of Furlough.
[time=816] Mary, would you come and just share what is on your heart and then we want to pray for Mary before she goes?
[time=822] Thank you, Pastor.
[time=824] I've been here for a year studying at Grace Theological Seminary and I've really enjoyed being a part of the church.
[time=830] And when I go back to Japan this summer, I'll be working with four other missionaries in a city of 35,000.
[time=836] Whereas far as we know, there's not one Christian.
[time=838] They're probably as someone. We're going to try to find them and start a church there.
[time=843] It's been a real pleasure to be here with you all and I'll be praying for you and I hope you'll be praying for me as well.
[time=849] Thanks, Mary. Mary, would you just stay here and let us pray together for her?
[time=854] God, our hearts do love you and we love people and we pray particularly for those in Japan who have never had the privilege of hearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=865] We thank you for Mary's willingness and purpose of heart to serve you and to serve you in that great country.
[time=872] Father, we would ask that your hand would be upon her in her own private world and in her world of ministry that you would give clear direction and insight.
[time=881] We pray that you would use her and the others who will be involved to help lead people to Christ and to establish a church there that would become a foothold for Christ in the communities around Yokohama, Japan.
[time=894] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Thank you, Mary. Lynn Roll is going to come now and minister to us in song, a song that is quiet, sensitive and speaks of the love of our Lord.
[time=924] [MUSIC]
[time=951] When you are alone, and your heart is torn, is all you need.
[time=965] When you can feel, your song is built, is all you need.
[time=978] He's the rock of your song, he's the anchor that holds, you're desperate to live.
[time=991] When the love is unsure, his love will end up in peace you will find.
[time=1006] Through all your years, the joy that cheers is all you need.
[time=1018] [MUSIC]
[time=1030] When you give him to that familiar sin, he's all you need.
[time=1043] He'll tell you paralyzed, it slowly eats you alive, is all you need.
[time=1057] He'll be faithful to you, though your heart isn't true, and your love's gone.
[time=1071] His forgiveness is real, he'll come for and heal.
[time=1085] God loves you so, he'll never let you go, he's all you need.
[time=1098] [MUSIC]
[time=1123] He'll be faithful to you, though your heart isn't true, and your love's gone.
[time=1137] His forgiveness is real, he'll come for and heal.
[time=1151] Through all your years, the joy that cheers, his love, his life.
[time=1174] [MUSIC]
[time=1199] Hello again and we want to thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=1204] This is the Sunday morning service of our church, and right now the offering and some announcements are being taken here in the service,
[time=1212] and we've recorded these few moments so we could talk directly with you friends who join us each week by way of television.
[time=1219] Coming up in the life of our church is one of our major events, the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1224] Rick, it's just around the corner again, it seems like we finished the Easter Cantata and we're thinking immediately about what the next program is,
[time=1231] as well as just preparing music for our regular Sunday morning services.
[time=1235] But our 14th annual Patriotic Panorama will be held on Sunday, June 28th, here in the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1244] We have two programs, one at five and one at eight, and our special guest this year is Carla Worley.
[time=1250] Rick Carla has an outstanding voice, a very fine soprano, and a great personality, loves the Lord,
[time=1257] and she'll be here sharing not only her music but her testimony, and the sanctuary choir will be singing along with some of our special groups.
[time=1265] Well, I'm looking forward to that. I not only studied biblical studies, but really at the undergraduate level,
[time=1271] I have a degree in U.S. history, and I just love the panorama, and I think it's so appropriate that we take a Sunday
[time=1278] and thank God for the blessing He has poured out on this country and to pray for America.
[time=1283] So we hope you can join us, and if you would like tickets, you can call or stop by here at the church office,
[time=1289] and we'll be glad to supply you with all the tickets you need for either the five or the eight o'clock service.
[time=1295] Well, coming up also is the summer months, and the summer months for us mean the summer Bible Conference.
[time=1301] We are so pleased to announce that this summer, every Thursday night, we'll either be having a special musical performance
[time=1308] or a special Bible challenge that we'll have here at seven o'clock every Thursday,
[time=1314] beginning June the 4th with Eternity, a contemporary music group, and then on June 11th, Bill Hybels.
[time=1321] Bill is just a little older than I am, and up 12 years ago we started a church with no money, no people, and no building.
[time=1328] Today, Willow Creek Community Church has a fabulous building, but more important than that, they are reaching about 10,000 people every Sunday morning in their two morning worship services.
[time=1339] Bill is an exciting communicator who has a vision for Christ.
[time=1343] You'll miss something if you miss either one of those nights, June the 4th or June the 11th, so we want to encourage you to come.
[time=1350] Then later in the summer, we have Bird Kettinger coming.
[time=1352] Bird Kettinger is scheduled for July 30th, and that's again a part of our summer Bible Conference.
[time=1357] And Rick, we've moved our Wednesday night to Thursday night so that our friends who normally have church on Wednesday night can come
[time=1363] and share with us and these special guests that come our way.
[time=1367] Well, I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1369] One final thing we'd like to share with you at this time is a pamphlet, a booklet entitled Timeless Insights.
[time=1376] It's a tool designed to help you and me study God's Word regularly and effectively.
[time=1383] I find two things are missing in most of our personal Bible studies.
[time=1387] The first is some level of consistency that we are daily going to the Word.
[time=1392] Many of us, it's today we try it and then we don't, and a week later we say we're going to get back at it.
[time=1398] A lot like dieting. We do and we don't.
[time=1401] And the second thing that's often missing along with some level of consistency is some degree of effectiveness.
[time=1407] Many people just open the Bible and struggle with what to read and what does it mean and how do I apply it to my life.
[time=1413] Timeless Insights is designed to overcome every one of those problems.
[time=1417] It gives you consistency because it's a daily Bible study guide.
[time=1421] It also gives you insight because it tells you what to read, then gives you explanation and application of what you've read.
[time=1429] We think it's so important that you're reading God's Word.
[time=1432] We'll send you your first copy free if you'll just write to us.
[time=1435] If you'd like to receive your copy of Timeless Insights, write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1446] I'll give you that address once again. It's the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1455] Thank you, Pete. Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1458] We go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1460] We're looking forward to music and message, and most of all, a time to worship the Lord together.
[time=1476] Time to be now, feelings never come, and I seem so all alone.
[time=1492] Yet through it all, I've known.
[time=1506] That feelings come and go, but, oh Lord, I know, that your love remains the same.
[time=1522] And when I call, your name, Lord, you are there, even when the feeling's gone.
[time=1543] Yes, you were there, and once more, you've been there all alone, and your love surrounds me.
[time=1558] Lord, Zion, empty shell, but nothing more and who knows why, you touched my life and filled it with your own.
[time=1575] I'm not alone, my heart's at home, for you are there.
[time=1593] Every now and then, I slip and fall again, just like all those times before I'm on my knees once more.
[time=1622] Looking for a sign, just to prove your mind, but I don't know where to start.
[time=1637] I look inside, my heart, and you are there, even when the feeling's gone.
[time=1656] Yes, you were there, and once more, you've been there all alone, and your love surrounds me.
[time=1671] Lord, Zion, empty shell, but nothing more and who knows why, you touched my life and filled it with your own.
[time=1687] I'm not alone, my heart's at home, you are there.
[time=1702] You were there, Lord, you were there, even when the feeling's gone.
[time=1718] Yes, you were there, and once more, you've been there all alone.
[time=1729] And your love surrounds me.
[time=1734] Lord, Zion, empty shell, but nothing more and who knows why, you touched my life and filled it with your own.
[time=1752] I'm not alone, my heart's at home, you are there.
[time=1793] Thank you, Susan.
[time=1795] God, we thank you today that we can meet with confidence that you are there in the very desperate moments of our anguish that you're there.
[time=1806] Those moments of joyful exuberance that you are there.
[time=1812] Father, we would pray today that that truth would not only be mind-known but heartfelt in the life of each believer today,
[time=1822] particularly those who are walking through hard times.
[time=1827] We pray today that those who have lost loved ones, perhaps on this Memorial Day weekend, they have visited a grave.
[time=1837] Some may have had to close out a family homestead.
[time=1842] Others may have to look across an empty table, and the one they have loved is not there.
[time=1849] Oh, God, we pray that you would be there.
[time=1852] Not only in the confidence of their mind, but in the reality of their experience.
[time=1857] May they feel your arms under them like the caring arms of a father holding a newborn.
[time=1864] God, today, we pray for Brad Moore as he anticipates surgery.
[time=1870] John Spats as he battles with cancer.
[time=1874] Mark Day gets as he wrestles for health and life.
[time=1879] God, that you would encourage these men and women.
[time=1882] We pray for an adjuri that you would give her recovery from a heart attack.
[time=1887] For Rob Ellis as he battles a new enemy in his health.
[time=1892] Father, we ask you to be there and for your presence to be known.
[time=1898] Father, we pray for those who are battling quiet enemies like discouragement, loneliness, failure.
[time=1909] Help them to know that you are there, and you will give to them recovery and strength.
[time=1917] God, we thank you for our country today, for the untold lives that were sacrificed on the battlefield to forge out our freedom.
[time=1927] God, we are their beneficiaries, and yet we know so few of their names.
[time=1932] But we quiet ourselves today and give you thanks.
[time=1938] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1944] If you have a Bible with you today, I encourage you to open it to the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1949] Proverbs is a book in the Old Testament.
[time=1952] Please don't be embarrassed to turn to the table of contents in your Bible and look up their reference.
[time=1958] And I'll tell you what page on your Bible you can find Proverbs chapter 6.
[time=1963] And we'll make our study there as at least a starting place today.
[time=1968] For those of you who are visiting or new to our church, we make it our habit to study the Bible.
[time=1973] And most often to study a particular book of the Bible to concentrate our thinking on a biblical study.
[time=1981] We're studying Proverbs, which has a variety of themes and so forth.
[time=1985] About six weeks we've grabbed onto the theme of biblical economics from the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1991] We've already had two installments.
[time=1993] I like that word since we're talking about economics.
[time=1996] We've had two installments, two lessons so far.
[time=1999] Let me review those for you, not the message, just the theme.
[time=2003] The first was a lesson on economics, lesson number one.
[time=2007] No other economic lesson will serve you if you miss lesson number one, not my teaching, just the principle, and that is the principle of contentment.
[time=2017] More does not satisfy.
[time=2021] Instead, more increases appetites for even more again.
[time=2026] If you don't learn the lessons and the scriptures on contentment, not our life's treasure will be enough.
[time=2036] You probably have heard the story of J.D. Rockefeller.
[time=2039] I have shared it with you before.
[time=2041] That in his senior years he was interviewed by a reporter.
[time=2044] The reporter quoted back Rockefeller's financial worth to the millionaire and said, "What would you like that you don't have if you could have anything else?" And Rockefeller said, "Just a little bit more.
[time=2059] Contentment is the first economic lesson any of us have got to learn." The second economic lesson we learned last week was the value of work.
[time=2069] That's God's plan.
[time=2071] It's that we work, that we work hard, and we earn our money like Smith Barney.
[time=2076] We make money the old fashioned way, we earn it.
[time=2080] That's the second lesson.
[time=2082] Okay, today's third lesson comes to us from three sources.
[time=2086] First of all, it comes to us from God by inspiration as he gave it to the second source which is Solomon, the human writer, and Solomon got it from his aunt.
[time=2098] Not his A-U-N-T, but his A-N-T.
[time=2101] Even in his palace he had some aunts.
[time=2104] And he quotes one of them, not that they spoke, but that they lived by example, Proverbs 6-6.
[time=2112] It says, "Go to the aunt, you sluggard.
[time=2117] Consider its ways and be wise.
[time=2121] It has no commander, no overseer, or ruler."
[time=2127] Yet it stores its provisions in summer.
[time=2132] It gathers its food at harvest.
[time=2136] The aunt teaches us two very important principles.
[time=2142] We looked at the first one last week.
[time=2144] That was the principle of working.
[time=2146] There's no foreman on the job.
[time=2148] There's no homeowner there saying, "Do it right." Yet the aunt works and works hard.
[time=2156] The second principle the aunt gives us is today's lesson.
[time=2159] That is the value of planning and saving.
[time=2166] God has blessed probably every one of us here with enormous financial wealth.
[time=2172] Now compared to the person next to you, you may have a little bit more or you may have a little bit less.
[time=2177] But if you compare yourself to the world economic standard, pretty much every one of us here is very wealthy.
[time=2185] The poorest of us are still above average.
[time=2188] If you compare yourself to people of all times, our value in dollars flashes up even higher.
[time=2198] Most of us do not struggle financially from a lack of resources.
[time=2203] They'll please allow me to be sensitive.
[time=2205] I know that a few do, and perhaps many more do, who watch by way of television.
[time=2211] But most of us who have economic difficulties, and that is most of us, do not have economic difficulties because there's a lack of resources here, but there is a lack of management of our resources.
[time=2226] We have no plan and no savings.
[time=2230] If we fail to plan, we are in fact planning to fail.
[time=2235] It doesn't matter whether that is out of sheer laziness or simple ignorance.
[time=2241] If we fail to plan, we are planning to fail.
[time=2245] God gave us the common sense to know that.
[time=2248] He gave it not only to us, he gave that common sense down to the ant.
[time=2254] The ant has enough sense to save and to store up and to plan for the future.
[time=2262] Well, in the book of Proverbs, there are three different planners that I've been able to discover.
[time=2269] The poor planner, the proper planner, and the presumptuous planner.
[time=2275] Let's look at each of those this morning.
[time=2278] First of all, the poor planner, I found at least these six qualities of the poor planner.
[time=2284] The poor planner to begin with is probably plain lazy.
[time=2290] Look to the ant, you slugger.
[time=2292] That's a word for a lazy person.
[time=2294] The ant has at least the industrious nature to say, "I've got to plan and I've got to save." And most people who do not plan and who do not save do not do so because of the work that is involved in planning and saving.
[time=2311] It's not easy to balance a checkbook, is it?
[time=2314] I mean, to take that print out from the bank and all of these cancelled checks and then all these automatic withdrawal and then these bank access card deposits and withdrawals you forgot, that's hard work.
[time=2326] To say, "All right, there's the paycheck." And now I need to make sure some of this money gets routed over here for long-term savings.
[time=2334] I need to make sure some money gets routed over here as a contingency fund.
[time=2338] Now I need to look at what's left as fixed spending and discretionary spending.
[time=2342] And I got lost in those terms.
[time=2344] Let's just go buy something. I'll feel better.
[time=2350] Most of the time it is the work of planning and saving that we avoid and we want to walk away from.
[time=2358] And in a word, it's laziness.
[time=2360] We read the verses 6, 7, and 8, but look at verse 9.
[time=2364] It continues the theme of laziness.
[time=2366] How long will you lie there, you slugger?
[time=2370] When will you get up from your sleep?
[time=2373] A little sleep.
[time=2375] Just a little slumber.
[time=2378] A little folding the hands to rest.
[time=2382] I'll do it first thing in the morning.
[time=2386] Poverty will come upon you like a bandit.
[time=2390] In scarcity, the lack of saved resources could like an armed man.
[time=2397] Most of us are poor planners because we simply are not willing to do the work that it takes.
[time=2403] The second quality or lack of quality in the poor planner is this.
[time=2408] They are not willing to defer pleasure.
[time=2411] Planning, budget, and saving are all bad words.
[time=2416] They are joy robbers.
[time=2419] Turn to Proverbs 21, verse 20.
[time=2422] This is a critical verse in the whole study of financial management.
[time=2427] We don't expect you to keep up with every reference we jump to, but this is a good reference to remember.
[time=2434] We'll come to the first phrase at length just now in passing.
[time=2439] It says, "In the house of the wise are stores of choice, food, and oil.
[time=2446] Saving, planning for the future." But notice this.
[time=2451] But a foolish man devours all that he has.
[time=2457] You see, the foolish man looks and he says, "All right.
[time=2460] I can take the money over here and I can save it for the future, or I can go buy what I want right now." And we live in an instant society.
[time=2471] One was the last time you heard a commercial for a pain reliever say, "Our product's really good.
[time=2477] It works in the long haul, but to be honest with you, it's slow." And we're thinking of coming out with new and improved next year.
[time=2485] It'll even be slower.
[time=2487] That stuff wouldn't sell no matter how good it works.
[time=2490] First, they come out with a product that guaranteed to give you fast relief in six months.
[time=2497] It'll come out as improved and it will give you faster relief.
[time=2503] And in six more months, it will come out new and improved and give you the fastest relief.
[time=2509] Well, if you take this medicine and its original form, you'll be better in two seconds.
[time=2514] If you take it in its new form, you'll be better in one second.
[time=2517] And if you take it in its new and improved form, by the time you pop the cap off the bottle, you're going to start feeling better.
[time=2526] You see, we live in that instant society.
[time=2528] Most of us are downright indignant if we walk into a McDonald's or Burger King and if we don't have food halfway down our throat in five minutes.
[time=2538] We live in an instant society and we live out of an appetite that is born and fed instant gratification.
[time=2546] That's why sexual purity is gone because we said, "This is my body. This feels good.
[time=2551] I don't want to do it. I'll gratify me now." We do that with our sexuality.
[time=2556] We do that with our finances.
[time=2558] We do that with our food.
[time=2560] Most people don't know that the battle of the bulge was a military war.
[time=2564] They think it's a daily struggle with the diet.
[time=2567] Why? Because we live on instant gratification.
[time=2571] Here it says, "The wise man, he doesn't just take whatever's left over." But it says, "Choice foods and oil." Premium products and dollars are laid aside, but it's the fool who says, "I've got to have it now." He devours it all instantly.
[time=2588] And what we can't buy, no problem, will borrow.
[time=2591] Most of us live under the marching orders of General George Armstrong Custer.
[time=2598] Charge!
[time=2601] You can't pay for it, charge it.
[time=2605] We have an appetite that says, "I'll gratify my desires now." No matter what desires they are.
[time=2611] And that is the fool who's not willing to defer pleasure to the future.
[time=2616] Third characteristic of the poor planner is found in Proverbs 13-16.
[time=2621] I'd like to quote the living Bible for you.
[time=2624] I think it's accurate here and it's clear.
[time=2627] It says, "A wise man thinks ahead.
[time=2631] A fool does not and even brags about it."
[time=2637] A poor planner often is arrogant and boastful over the fact they don't have a plan.
[time=2648] They only take one verse out of the Scripture.
[time=2651] Take no thought for tomorrow.
[time=2654] No plan.
[time=2656] And they mock and ridicule those who save and defer pleasure to the future.
[time=2661] They laugh at that and they boldly tell about how they're willing to take a risk.
[time=2666] Fourth quality of the poor planner is this one.
[time=2671] They blindly presume on the future.
[time=2675] Proverbs 22-3 says, "A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it." You see, it is the poor planner who says, "Ah, you know, tomorrow will be there.
[time=2690] I'll do that tomorrow." We're going to talk about presumption more in a moment, so let us just leave it at that.
[time=2697] The fifth quality is this.
[time=2700] They are usually reckless in their attempts to make up for poor planning.
[time=2707] Proverbs 14-16 says, "A wise man is cautious and avoids danger."
[time=2716] The full plunges ahead with great confidence.
[time=2722] You see, what happens is once you get behind in the economic game and we've already ignored the rules, then we become reckless in our attempts to get caught up.
[time=2733] We get reckless because we try to invest in some get rich quick scheme.
[time=2738] Or we get reckless and we say, "I borrowed to get myself into this mess.
[time=2742] I'll borrow to get myself out of it." There was a sign in the bank window that says, "Come in today.
[time=2750] Now you can borrow all of the money you need to get out of debt."
[time=2758] Let me tell you about two people.
[time=2760] One, the banker likes.
[time=2762] The other, the banker does not like.
[time=2764] I like bankers. This isn't meant to pick on them.
[time=2767] The man or woman the banker likes has a mortgage on their home.
[time=2772] That's reasonable, but their mortgage is as high as they can get.
[time=2777] They have borrowed money on six, seven, perhaps eight different credit cards until they've gotten them to the max for which the bank sends you a letter and says, "Congratulations. We've upped your credit line." This individual borrowed for last year's vacation and has not paid for it, so they have the map out charting this year's vacation.
[time=2799] They filed their income tax early so they could lever that money against another loan.
[time=2804] Now they're coming into the bank saying, "We'd like to consolidate all this into one big loan." The banker says, "Oh, I think we can do that for you." The individual the banker considers a high risk.
[time=2817] Is this man or woman?
[time=2819] They're probably 40, 45, 50 years old.
[time=2822] They've never borrowed for a thing except for a mortgage on their house.
[time=2825] Never been late in one of those payments.
[time=2827] They're considered a poor credit risk.
[time=2832] You see, we become reckless in our attempts to make up for our poor financial planning.
[time=2838] Howard Cocel once described a football player who ran, he said, with reckless abandonment.
[time=2846] That's how most of us run, but instead of tucking the pigskin under our arm, we tuck, master curse, the checkbook, and 40 other pieces of plastic.
[time=2858] And off we go, dodging tacklers at the department store, running through the convenience mark, shopping here, spending there.
[time=2867] We're reckless.
[time=2869] Finally, this quality of the poor planner.
[time=2874] He or she will and should face the consequences of failing to manage their resources.
[time=2882] I know I said that in the exact same tone last week about the lazy person.
[time=2886] I will repeat again.
[time=2887] If somebody is lazy, do not rescue them.
[time=2891] Do not pay their bills.
[time=2893] Do not put gas in their tank because they will continue to sponge off of you until the sponge goes dry.
[time=2901] And when the sponge grows dry, they won't go looking for work.
[time=2904] They'll look for a new sponge.
[time=2906] The same thing is true about the one who mismanages their money.
[time=2910] I don't believe it's the job of society to pay for the lifestyle of the poor planner
[time=2916] when he goes broke.
[time=2918] Nor do I believe it's the responsibility of a Christian individual or any church to pay to help another person who has mismanaged their funds.
[time=2928] That's not to say that if a brother or a sister, a part of the body of Christ go through reverses and circumstances beyond their control that we don't care and help.
[time=2938] That is our responsibility to care and help.
[time=2940] But when good old Charlie has had his fill in his share and good old Charlie has squandered it,
[time=2946] good old Charlie ought to look for no one or nothing to rescue him.
[time=2951] Proverbs 22-3 again says, "A prudent man for sees danger and takes refuge,
[time=2958] but the simple one keeps on going and will suffer for it."
[time=2965] Let's shift gears here and change the tempo.
[time=2968] Let's talk about the proper planner.
[time=2971] Eight things I'd like to share with you about the proper planner.
[time=2974] Number one is this.
[time=2975] The proper planner commits their plans to the Lord.
[time=2980] Turn to chapter 16 because there are three different references in chapter 16 that talk about the proper planner.
[time=2987] I'm going to go through them somewhat backwards.
[time=2990] Those of you who know me don't have any surprise.
[time=2994] Chapter 16 verse 9, "In his heart a man plans his course,
[time=3003] but the Lord determines his steps." Chapter 16 verse 3, "Commit to the Lord whatever you do and your plans will succeed." To the man, verse 1, "To man belong the plans of the heart, but from the Lord comes the reply of the tongue." See what the Bible is saying here is, "Yes, plan.
[time=3028] But plan by saying, 'Lord, my life belongs to you.
[time=3031] My family belongs to you.
[time=3033] My financial resources belong to you.
[time=3035] My checkbook belongs to you.
[time=3038] God, what principles do you have in your word?
[time=3041] I will follow them.
[time=3044] I commit it all to you.
[time=3046] If you tell me to be content, I will be content.
[time=3050] If you tell me I have freedom to spend, then I will enjoy that freedom." Second principle of the proper planner is this.
[time=3058] They seek and follow wise godly counsel.
[time=3067] That's found in verse 20 of chapter 16.
[time=3071] Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers and blessed is he who trusts the Lord, puts both of our principles there together, trusting the Lord, committing our plans to him, and secondly taking heed to instruction.
[time=3086] Of those of us who are having financial difficulty, only a fraction will ever even seek help.
[time=3093] And of those minority people who seek help for financial planning, only a fraction of them will follow through on that advice.
[time=3104] I have a friend named Larry.
[time=3106] Larry used to live in Akron when I lived there.
[time=3109] Larry at age 30 was a multi-millionaire and he inherited none of it.
[time=3114] He had worked, he had put together a business, and he had made it, and he had made it big.
[time=3119] To give you an idea of his neighborhood, across the street owned their own business too.
[time=3123] Their business was called the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.
[time=3126] It was kind of a poor neighborhood.
[time=3130] Larry told this story.
[time=3132] A friend of his, who was a man of great financial assets, had less managed them to the point where he was on the verge of bankruptcy, and this could be millionaire came to Larry for financial advice.
[time=3145] Larry was in the business of giving financial advice.
[time=3149] Larry charted out a very simple, yet profound plan for his friend, and he was expecting compensation for it.
[time=3158] The man said to Larry, "How much do I owe you?" Larry said, "You can pay me in one of two ways.
[time=3166] One, you can pay me in cash." And he gave him the bill which was in the multiple thousands of dollars.
[time=3174] So you can pay me cash right now, or secondly, you can pay me in a different way.
[time=3178] You can pay me by taking this and doing exactly what I've written down for you to do.
[time=3185] Larry said, "Now how would you like to pay me?" You see, a proper planner will seek and follow wise counsel.
[time=3196] You know, one of the things we could do to operate our counseling centers, we ought to raise the fees to about $100 an hour.
[time=3203] That would still be competitive in the marketplace and then say, "Now, you come back next week, and if you've done everything we told you, you owe us nothing. If you haven't, you owe us $100." I bet the effectiveness of the counseling would multiply, because most people don't seek counsel, and the few that do, few of them follow it.
[time=3222] But a wise man, Proverbs 16-20, gives heed to instruction.
[time=3227] The third quality is one that I struggle with myself greatly.
[time=3232] It's found in Proverbs 27, verse 23, and that is, a wise planner knows the value of record keeping.
[time=3241] Proverbs 27, verse 23.
[time=3245] Be sure you know the condition of your flocks.
[time=3248] Give careful attention to your herds.
[time=3251] For riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations.
[time=3256] Some of you are probably saying, "How on earth did he get record keeping out of that?" Well, this man's business was agriculture.
[time=3263] Animal husbandry, and he was a very wealthy man.
[time=3267] It's Solomon, we knew he was wealthy, but you know he's wealthy because of the little letter S that follows the word "flock" and "herd." Most people maybe had one or two animals.
[time=3278] Very few people had a flock. This cat, he's got flocks and herds.
[time=3283] And any sharp businessman knows this.
[time=3287] When you're dealing in commodities, you better be good at inventory.
[time=3292] And we are simply saying there, "I'm in the business of dairy products from cows and wool from sheep and meat from both of them,
[time=3303] and I better pay careful attention to my inventory." If you're a businessman in commodities, you must know the value of inventory.
[time=3313] If you are simply a family member or a single individual, the application is this.
[time=3319] Balance your checkbook, know the balance on your credit cards, pay them off before the interest charge comes, and always know your state of financial affairs.
[time=3330] Don't ever have a checkbook that you open it up, and here are the list of checks.
[time=3336] But over here, there is no deduction of how much they are.
[time=3342] It is sheer laziness, and it is ignoring a basic principle of financial management.
[time=3348] You can't manage money that you don't know where it went and where it is.
[time=3353] The next principle of a good planner is this.
[time=3357] They know the value of saving for the future.
[time=3361] It says, and we have looked at it earlier, that the ant has the intuitive knowledge
[time=3367] to save in the time of harvest.
[time=3370] Now most of you are like me, and that is, you were never born on a farm.
[time=3375] Some of you were, but these people were not only agrarians by occupation, they were agrarians by lifestyle.
[time=3383] They lived off of the land.
[time=3385] And they were smart enough to know that if you wanted to eat in December, you better pick the grain in August.
[time=3392] Most of us don't know that.
[time=3394] We think you just go out and pick it when you want it.
[time=3397] We do a little bit of gardening, we have no green thumb.
[time=3401] But a few things grow amidst the weeds.
[time=3404] But it's interesting, we put the seed in the soil and instantly our kids say, "Can we have strawberries now?" Well honey, we just planted them, it'll take time.
[time=3415] And there's only a season that you can plant, and there's only a season that you can harvest.
[time=3421] And if you miss those, they're gone.
[time=3425] The ant says, "I will save in those seasons that you can harvest." I think the Bible hints at three different things we ought to save and plan for.
[time=3434] One is that it hints we ought to save for future opportunities.
[time=3437] Proverbs 13, 16 says, "The wise man thinks ahead." Proverbs 21, 20 says, "There is a stored up choice, meat, and oil in the house of the wise man for future opportunities."
[time=3450] I believe the Bible also says we ought to save for future difficulties.
[time=3458] That man who saves up the oil knows that there may not be a bumper crop next year.
[time=3466] And so he says, "Because tomorrow may not be better than today."
[time=3472] And then finally, the Bible only hints that we ought to save not for retirement, but for a long life.
[time=3480] I don't know of any place in the Bible that says you ought to work as hard as you can, as much money as you can, save it so that you can retire early and live for yourself.
[time=3491] One of our financial men here at the church wisely pointed out to his knowledge, there's not an illustration of the Bible of a man of God or a woman of God retiring.
[time=3501] We're to serve the Lord and to serve him forever.
