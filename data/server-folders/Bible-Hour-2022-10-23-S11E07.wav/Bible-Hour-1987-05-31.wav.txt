[time=116] Welcome to an hour of worship and praise on the Bible out.
[time=120] Thank you for joining us.
[time=122] Our guest speaker today is Dr. James M. Greer, the academic dean of Grand Rapids, Baptist Seminary.
[time=128] Please locate your Bibles so that you can study with us as Mr. Greer shares with us what God has laid on his heart.
[time=135] Our special music today includes a song from the sanctuary choir and a group from the Black Hawk Christian School called Mirror.
[time=144] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=153] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=157] Now, here's Rick.
[time=161] It's a mind to study the Scriptures. Welcome.
[time=164] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible hour.
[time=168] We're not on here in Fort Wayne today.
[time=170] We've been preempted, but our friends in Marion and also in South Bend are joining us.
[time=175] We're here today that we can sing and worship together.
[time=178] Part of our worship is a spirit of celebration, and our choir leads us with that theme.
[time=184] [MUSIC - 170 seconds]
[time=357] What a privilege to come and celebrate
[time=365] the events of our life, the life of our Savior, and the opportunity to look forward to the fellowship we'll have together.
[time=373] There are others that are celebrating this day and we honor them as graduates from high schools and colleges around the nation.
[time=381] We want to welcome them and just praise the Lord for their progress and their education.
[time=387] Let's continue with our worship singing together 41, thanking the Lord for all he's done for us.
[time=393] We'll sing all three verses of number 41.
[time=396] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=539] Today is a day that I share with you good news and bad news
[time=549] and the good and bad news are the same.
[time=552] Mike and Carolyn Ballast are with us for the last Sunday.
[time=556] That is bad news because we're going to miss them, but it's certainly good news because they're headed back to the field of Manila Philippines where God has obviously uniquely equipped them to serve him there.
[time=569] Their heart is there, their ministry is there.
[time=571] God has given us a year together and we rejoice with that.
[time=575] Mike is going to come and share a word of greeting, but his wife is here.
[time=579] Carolyn, can I ask you to stand and I know Tammy is here over here.
[time=584] Tammy's already saying, "Oh, Rick, don't make me stand up and embarrass me." I don't know whether David and Steve are here.
[time=589] Daniel, their oldest son, has not been home.
[time=592] He's away at school, but there's Steve.
[time=594] Would all the ballast please stand.
[time=597] Tammy, oh, David, I couldn't find you. You were so far in the back.
[time=601] Good. Mike, come share your word of greeting.
[time=606] It is with mixed emotions that we leave.
[time=609] We're anxious to get back and be with our dear brothers and sisters in Christ in the Philippines and to return to the work that God has called us to do.
[time=618] But it's tough to leave Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=621] You've had a tremendous ministry in our lives this year.
[time=625] We're thankful for the opportunities we've had to minister to work with E.E.
[time=630] and to share Bible studies and to be in your homes for meals and simply to share about the Lord Jesus Christ and share about what God's doing in the Philippines with each one of you.
[time=641] We are grateful to God for you.
[time=645] We're grateful for your partnership with us, not only financially and in prayer support, but in sending Manila 88 team to help in planting churches next year.
[time=654] We're especially thankful to the staff of Black Hawk Christian School and their sensitivity and special help with our children this year.
[time=661] It's ministered to our hearts and lives.
[time=664] We do ask for special prayer as we go back the first six months as we get off the plane in June 18 in Manila is for language study.
[time=673] We'll be in a Tagalog refresher course north of Manila in a language school there.
[time=678] And then as the Lord makes it possible, we would like to see three new churches started
[time=684] in Metro Manila during our next term of service.
[time=687] And we especially covet your prayers for that kind of ministry.
[time=692] I leave you with the words of Paul.
[time=695] Only brothers, goodbye.
[time=698] Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way.
[time=703] The Lord be with all of you.
[time=705] And Rick, I would like to leave with the church, a token of our appreciation and also a reminder to pray a special wall hanging from the Philippines from the ballast.
[time=720] Thank you, Mike. We'll hang that in the lobby of this auditorium as a way of doing exactly that, serving as a reminder to pray for you.
[time=729] Let's take this moment to pray for the ballast family.
[time=732] God, we are so thankful that you have established between this church and Mike and Carolyn, their family, such a kindred spirit.
[time=740] Thank you for the heavy investment of life they have made to us.
[time=744] And now to the country of Manila, the Philippines again.
[time=749] Father, we would pray not presumptuously, but as boldly as your word encourages us that you would help and never strengthen their efforts to serve you
[time=760] and establish these three new churches that they look forward to.
[time=764] Father, we ask your blessing on their life, safety as they travel and prosperity in the gospel for the kingdom's sake in Christ's name.
[time=774] Amen. Thank you, Mike.
[time=777] Today is also a special Sunday because this is graduation Sunday.
[time=782] Tonight it is commencement exercises for our church and our school here at Blackhawk,
[time=788] but we are proud of every one of our graduates from every high school and college, and if you'll look at the back of the bulletin, there's about 50 graduates this year, and I would like to read their names almost all of these people were in the last service,
[time=803] but if you're here in this service, please stand when you hear your name and then we'll applaud for all of you at the end.

[time=906] Our Ministry of Music is now going to be rendered to us from one of our high school groups. Their name is Mir, and they're part of our school here at Blackhawk, and we're looking forward to commencement exercises tonight, and one to invite all of you to be here at six o'clock.
[time=920] Our evening service will be the commencement exercise for Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=940] Let us celebrate the King.
[time=945] Please, our voice is now in sight.
[time=951] Let us celebrate the King.
[time=960] Come, our people sing along.
[time=966] You are the King of Kings.
[time=969] You are the Lord of Lords.
[time=972] You are the King of Kings, and we celebrate, celebrate, celebrate your life this way.
[time=986] Victory and death for me.
[time=992] Please, tonight, return of me.
[time=996] I return of me.
[time=998] As the gift of those you love.
[time=1764] Turn please in your Bibles to Exodus chapter 20.
[time=1768] Where I'd like to do a summary of the ten commandments for you.
[time=1772] Exodus chapter 20.
[time=1774] Jehovah God has delivered his people Israel out of bondage in Egypt.
[time=1779] He has freed them by blood and by power.
[time=1782] They are now the free people of God redeemed by his graves.
[time=1786] They have left Egypt and they are now in the wilderness and God has promised to fulfill his covenant oath to Abram by leading them to a land.
[time=1796] In Exodus chapter 20 we read these words.
[time=1800] And God spake all these words saying, "I am Jehovah thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage.
[time=1809] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[time=1812] Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image." Verse 7.
[time=1817] Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain.
[time=1822] Verse 8.
[time=1823] Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
[time=1826] Verse 12.
[time=1828] Honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
[time=1835] No killing.
[time=1837] No adultery.
[time=1838] No stealing.
[time=1840] No bearing false witness against your neighbor.
[time=1843] No coveting anything that is thy neighbors.
[time=1848] These 10 words as we commonly call them frame up for us the basis now
[time=1854] for the conduct of the free people of God.
[time=1858] As the people of God redeemed by grace and by blood, they now are in movement toward Canaan and God comes to them to give them direction for their life of liberty.
[time=1869] The negative commandments kind of form the outer perimeter of the covenant.
[time=1875] If you could think of them as boundaries, God has entered in by grace to relationship with this people.
[time=1884] To remain in appropriate relationship with God, there are certain boundaries that one cannot cross.
[time=1892] Outside of that boundary is the realm of death.
[time=1896] Inside this boundary is the realm of life.
[time=1900] If you worship other than Jehovah God, you will die.
[time=1905] If you take the name of Jehovah your God for useless purpose, you will die.
[time=1910] For you see, these commands aren't little misdemeanors that you pay a fine if you violate.
[time=1915] They actually define for us the very fiber of the divine human relationship.
[time=1922] We have two positive commands and it's one of them I'm interested in this morning.
[time=1927] The first is remember Shabbat to keep it holy.
[time=1933] The second, honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land with Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
[time=1942] And I'd like also to read a second explication of that from Leviticus 19.
[time=1947] And Jehovah speak unto Moses saying, speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel
[time=1953] and say unto them, You shall be holy for I Jehovah your God and holy.
[time=1959] And ye shall fear every man his mother and his father.
[time=1963] And you shall keep my Sabbath, for I am Jehovah your God.
[time=1968] Turn you not unto idols nor make to you a molten God.
[time=1972] I am Jehovah your God.
[time=1975] For most of us this command, the fifth command, honor your father and your mother
[time=1981] is basically addressed to children and it means children obey your parents.
[time=1988] Now it does mean that.
[time=1990] But the scope of this command is much greater than the simple biblical mandate
[time=1996] of the authority pattern of the home.
[time=1999] An authority in which the rule of God is mediated to the family through the will of the parents.
[time=2006] This command has a great breads to it.
[time=2010] Let me take you back in the old covenant community to explain to you that bread.
[time=2016] One day God broke into the life of an idol worshiper.
[time=2020] His name was Abram.
[time=2022] He lived in Peyton Aaron.
[time=2024] And he and his father Tara had been worshipping idols on the other side of the river.
[time=2029] And God broke into his life and he said Abram I want you to get up and to leave this land and to go to a land that I am going to show you.
[time=2037] And Abram I am going to set my grace upon you.
[time=2040] And I am going to make your seed as multiple as the stars of heaven and as the sands of the seed.
[time=2047] And out of your seed I am going to bring a particular person in whom all the nations of the world are going to be blessed.
[time=2055] And Abram obeyed God. He got up and he left.
[time=2059] And he went out into that land not knowing where he was going.
[time=2063] And God directed him and he spoke to him and he broke into his life.
[time=2067] And he had this great promise that God had given to him.
[time=2071] But you recall he was childless.
[time=2074] There was no one to whom the promise could be turned over.
[time=2078] There was no one who could take this inheritance of God's commitment and reinvest it in that person who in the next generation would reinvest it again.
[time=2088] And Abraham and Sarah weren't real pleased with that and they devised their own means to get a son.
[time=2094] His name was Ishmael.
[time=2097] But Jehovah said no. He's not the one.
[time=2101] And he waited until they were both past the ability to bear children.
[time=2108] They were both past the age when procreation was possible for physiological reasons.
[time=2115] And he blessed them by miracle and he gave them a son.
[time=2119] Mike, can you imagine what that home was like? What that tent was like?
[time=2124] Can you imagine how often Isaac heard the story of how God broke into Dad's life
[time=2130] way back there and paid in Aaron?
[time=2132] And how God had met him at the oaks of memory?
[time=2136] And how God had walked with him as he was heading down toward Sodom and Gomorrah?
[time=2141] And how God had given the warning and lot his uncle had escaped?
[time=2148] And all of the things that Jehovah had done and all of the promises that Jehovah had made
[time=2154] and all of this inheritance and all of this truth was now going to be communicated and deposited
[time=2161] in a second-jackerate generation to a son.
[time=2166] And Isaac honored his father and his mother.
[time=2170] He placed his confidence in Jehovah the Redeemer God.
[time=2174] And he walked uprightly before that God.
[time=2177] And he took the truth of his father and he built on it.
[time=2181] And he gave his life to it. And he too went back and got a wife from Peyton Aaron.
[time=2186] And he married her and God blessed them and he gave them children.
[time=2192] May that must have been an interesting home with those twin boys Jacob and Esau.
[time=2197] How often no doubt the central focus of life in the home centered around the great and staggering promises that God made to Grandad.
[time=2207] How that right out of the blue he broke into his life.
[time=2211] And he announced to him some decisions that he had made about Abraham and about the people of God and about the program of God in history.
[time=2222] But one of these two boys Esau.
[time=2226] Place no value upon that heritage.
[time=2229] Couldn't find any ties to the past.
[time=2233] Couldn't seem to find any answers or solutions to his life by thinking about the fidelity of the living God and the promises that have been made to his grandfather and to his father.
[time=2246] And in a moment of hunger he treated his birthright as being no more valuable.
[time=2253] And the stop at a quick food place.
[time=2260] And the inheritance was given to Jacob the younger son.
[time=2264] Strange is it not that Isaac for all of his grasp of biblical truth.
[time=2270] For all of his understanding of the commitment of the investment and the program of God.
[time=2275] Isaac seemed determined to bless that evil son Esau didn't he?
[time=2281] Strange.
[time=2282] But the blessing through skillful manipulation went to Jacob.
[time=2288] Ladies and gentlemen are you getting an idea here?
[time=2290] I hope you are.
[time=2292] The idea is simple.
[time=2294] The idea is that God's promises and God's covenant has a continuity to it.
[time=2300] It has a continuance to it.
[time=2303] There is to be progress and development but it is to be rooted in the past.
[time=2310] That there is a heritage delivered.
[time=2312] The heritage is to be taken and expanded.
[time=2316] But it is to be delivered to the next generation.
[time=2319] That generation is to receive it and there to take it and there to re-express it.
[time=2324] There to grow in their understanding of it.
[time=2327] There to do a better job with it than what their parents did.
[time=2330] And they are to invest it in their children who in turn will develop it beyond what their parents did.
[time=2337] My friends that's the program of God.
[time=2342] That's how God intended in the old covenant community to advance his kingdom and his work in the midst of the world.
[time=2350] That's what this promise is all about.
[time=2355] When a child is born in a home he not only receives from his parents the physical life that throbs in his being.
[time=2365] But he receives a tradition.
[time=2368] He receives a set of values.
[time=2371] He receives a central focus.
[time=2374] He receives an inheritance that far transcends material wealth.
[time=2380] It is that which has to do with God and the program of God.
[time=2385] And this is to be delivered.
[time=2387] It is to be developed.
[time=2388] It is to be re-delivered and re-deposited.
[time=2391] And as this goes on the program of God grows.
[time=2394] That's why the promise.
[time=2396] That if you honor and respect and exalt and highly respect those who give you life both physical life and spiritual life.
[time=2406] And you manifest that by taking that investment they have made and developing it and reinvesting it in your children.
[time=2414] Then God promises you continuity and perpetuity of life within the land that he has given.
[time=2424] The time constraints force me to go from the time of Jacob who you recall had a lot of children.
[time=2432] Two wives and two concubines and a lot of conflict in his home.
[time=2437] His first sons were morally unqualified to receive the blessing of the inheritance.
[time=2444] And the inheritance went to Joseph you recall.
[time=2448] He got the right of primogenitor the double portion of inheritance.
[time=2453] He was the one out of the children who had built on his father's commitment.
[time=2458] He was the one who honored God in Egypt and God honored him and he preserved his father and his brothers through the time of famine.
[time=2467] It was in Joseph's house that Jacob died. It was in Jacob's house that Isaac died.
[time=2477] It was in Isaac's house that Abraham dwelt.
[time=2483] They honored their father and their mother and God blessed them with spiritual prosperity.
[time=2494] That program operated in the history of Israel.
[time=2499] It came to its culmination in the lifetime of David and Solomon when the investment in the land was brought to its completion.
[time=2509] And the people of God were at the very pinnacle of their development of the covenant made with Abraham.
[time=2516] And they committed themselves to the spiritual truth and they walked uprightly and they taught it.
[time=2526] But soon after that the breakdown came.
[time=2532] And children didn't honor their parents. And the program and the heritage went backward until captivity came.
[time=2542] And when captivity came there was only a remnant the small group of true Israelites redeemed by God's grace who walked in truth.
[time=2554] And in the fullness of time at the appropriate moment in history when God had through family after family in His covenant people brought the development
[time=2565] and the increase of His revelation, the word of the prophets and all of the other salient details to the very apex of history.
[time=2575] God selected a Jewish home. There was a mother named Mary, the father named Joseph.
[time=2585] And into that home was birth the child who was the true seed of Abraham.
[time=2593] Maya can you imagine what the central focus of that home was like?
[time=2598] Can you imagine as Jesus was handled and as he began to be able to manipulate the symbols of language how his mother would tell him of the visit of the angel
[time=2610] and the announcement that was brought to her?
[time=2614] And how daddy Joseph would take him and sit him down and hold him and explain to him when he thought that Mary had been unfaithful and he was going to put her away.
[time=2627] The angel came to him and into this young life was invested.
[time=2633] All of the content of the promise of Abraham, Isaac and Joseph.
[time=2639] And into this life was going to come the culmination of all of the promises of God and God in earth history and man form was going to bring to culmination his redemptive purpose.
[time=2653] And saving men from their sin and recreating them in his image.
[time=2661] Jesus par excellence as a man honored his father and his mother.
[time=2675] You recall as he was impaled on the cross and he looked out at that scene of mockers and he heard their jibes and his eyes fixed on the panorama of those gathered around the cross.
[time=2695] His eye fell on his mother and there beside her stood his intimate friend and disciple, John.
[time=2707] And as a good son taking responsibility for the investment of his life with his father dead and his mother widowed in all of his brothers having rejected him.
[time=2721] Finging him slightly off mentally and wishing to restrain him.
[time=2727] As he was at the very edge of death he said to his mother, "Mother, there's your son."
[time=2737] And to John he said, "Son, there's your mother."
[time=2743] For even in his death as the heir and the responsible person for his mother he cared for her at that moment.
[time=2760] Honor your father and your mother means so much more than children obey your parents.
[time=2770] It is the way that God has accomplished his program in earth history.
[time=2775] It is the basis of continuity of progress founded and structured in the past.
[time=2782] It is continuity in covenant.
[time=2790] Since he's been resurrected and he is seated at the right hand of the Father and he has initiated his new program in the world.
[time=2798] The program of his kingdom and on the day of Pentecost he sent the Holy Spirit and he birthed what we commonly call the church.
[time=2806] God is still in the process through history of producing and fulfilling his purpose.
[time=2815] And this command remains salient for us today.
[time=2821] God has a purpose for his church in the world.
[time=2825] It didn't start with you. It didn't start with me.
[time=2830] We can look back generation after generation after generation to people who by the grace of God have been birthed into the family of God have been incorporated into the body of Christ.
[time=2844] They have received the truth as a deposit.
[time=2848] They worked on it.
[time=2850] They built educational institutions so that they could develop and understand it more fully than the former generation.
[time=2858] They took it and they used it in their defense of the gospel against attack.
[time=2863] They developed it so that it could be put into the appropriate structures to take it into cross-cultural ministries and to be siege men on behalf of Jesus Christ to be reconciled to the living God.
[time=2876] We build on their foundation.
[time=2879] We haven't started the thing ourselves.
[time=2882] We are tied to the past.
[time=2885] There's a heritage that stands behind us.
[time=2888] Some gave their lives for its perpetuity.
[time=2891] We possess it today.
[time=2895] Yet the primary place in the Church of Jesus Christ where God intends this continuity of covenant relationship is to be found in the home and not to the church at large.
[time=2910] It is in the home where God intended that the central focus of life would be the covenant relationship he has established with his people.
[time=2922] Where the central point of discussion would be the redemptive mediacy of Jesus Christ.
[time=2927] A home in which gratitude for grace would be the constant atmosphere in which people lived and in which children were raised.
[time=2935] A home in which the Word of God was not only carried to church on Sunday, but was taught where the expression of that truth was developed and it was implemented and it was communicated to the children.
[time=2950] It was that in which there was a reinvestment.
[time=2956] I have a tender spot in this area.
[time=2962] My dad was a pastor in New York City.
[time=2967] My dad immigrated from Scotland having been an evangelist assistant.
[time=2972] He never had any formal training for ministry.
[time=2975] He read prolifically. He gave himself to the study of scripture.
[time=2979] And for 46 years he pastored the only church he ever pastored.
[time=2984] He made a deposit in my life.
[time=2988] I spent 11 years in theological education digging the same hole.
[time=2994] I don't know if you know about digging holes, but the deeper the hole gets the more energy it takes to get a little dirt out.
[time=2999] It seems like my education was like that. The deeper the hole in theology got, the hotter it was to get a little dirt out and to make any progress.
[time=3008] But I had opportunities my dad didn't have, but what he invested in me is that which in turn now I've been able to work on.
[time=3016] And that's the whole principle.
[time=3018] The whole principle is that one doesn't just take it and sustain it as it was.
[time=3023] I'm afraid that's been our mentality. It's been the mentality of fundamentalism.
[time=3028] You get what's given to you and you sustain it without change.
[time=3031] We'll get nowhere in the kingdom if that's how we approach it.
[time=3035] We've got to take it and we've got to build it and we've got to know it better and advance it in understanding.
[time=3041] We've got to find new communication means to get it out.
[time=3045] We've got to find better ways to structure it in cross-cultural settings.
[time=3050] We've got to keep working on this task and deliver it to the next generation in a much better form than the way we got it.
[time=3057] Let me ask you a question. Is that the way it's going? Are we stronger today than the church was 50 years ago or are we weaker?
[time=3069] If I came into your home today and I sat down in your living room with the magazines on the table, with the check marks on the TV guide,
[time=3082] with the art on the walls, with the discussion in atmosphere and arrangement of your home, demonstrate the central covenant commitment of your lives to Jesus Christ.
[time=3097] Would it be that in which the whole atmosphere and central focus would be based upon the understanding of the content of God's self-disclosure and its implementation into the framework of life?
[time=3113] If I read your will, would it manifest that in the investment of your financial means that the advancement of the kingdom of Jesus Christ has a significant place?
[time=3128] Or would I find that your reading table, your TV set, the music you listen to, the artwork you buy, your will, the pattern of your life conforms to a value set that doesn't match covenant commitment to the true and living God?
[time=3153] Are we going forward or backward? Or I know what you want to say? The young people want to say, hey listen, we've listened to this stuff about the past too long.
[time=3164] I'm not interested in building on the past. I want to be my own man. Hear me this morning, young people. That's the existentialistic lie that has dominated thinking.
[time=3175] Break all the ties. You've got to be free. You can't let anything inhibit or hold you down. You've got to make your own decisions. You can't take what your parents have said.
[time=3185] You've got to be an authentic person. Kick it all over. Grab what you want out of life. Structure your own life.
[time=3194] What does it matter anyway? With missiles hitting ships and the Persian Gulf and 37 sailors dead, with Gaddafi with nuclear warheads, with a powder keg in the Near East, with a Russian might, with what's going on in Nicaragua, with a contras scandal,
[time=3219] with Pearlygate and the mess and fundamentalism and media evangelism. Look at that whole mess. What is there to be secure about? What is there to bring perpetuity?
[time=3233] It's not going to last. You might as well get what you can.
[time=3237] Friends, I say to you this morning, God's way, is to start with the security of the heritage that has been communicated, physical, spiritual. The whole structure of life is now invested and developed.
[time=3257] Next generation is to advance it. The other end of the spectrum, we say things like this. It's a waste of time. It's like trying to sweep the ocean dry with a broom.
[time=3270] We can't get anywhere. The powers of darkness are too great. It's time to send back and sing. When I look in his wonderful face, it's going to be worth it all.
[time=3281] When I finally get to heaven where the kingdom of God is safe and all this battle is over, so I'm just going to sit back and wait for Jesus to come and hope my kids get saved in the meantime.
[time=3294] Well, I'm looking forward for the coming of the Lord. But I want you to know if we take a retreatist attitude in the midst of this conflict, the Church of the next generation is going to be miserably impoverished.
[time=3308] And the program and the work of God is going to suffer at our hands.
[time=3313] Now I'd like to suggest to you this morning that all of that is involved in this simple, direct, biblical command, honor your father and your mother.
[time=3334] That your days may be long in the land, which Jehovah God has given you.
[time=3339] You say, "My parents were unsaved, and right now I'm not even a part of that heritage."
[time=3346] Well, my friend, the thing to do this morning is to repent and to believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior and step into a line of truth, a line of commitment, the Church of Jesus Christ and receive from Christ that free grace that redeems and step into the truth to build upon.
[time=3363] You say, "Well, it's too late for me. I'm old. My kids are grown up."
[time=3371] How about the investment of what God has blessed you with in the future?
[time=3376] Will it enhance the growth of the kingdom and the days ahead?
[time=3380] Or will it bless evil by going into the hands of children who have no interest in the work of God?
[time=3389] How about it, young people?
[time=3393] Can you receive from the hands of your parents the deposit of spiritual truth, the investment of a covenant sealed with the blood of Jesus Christ that we celebrate at every communion service?
[time=3405] And take that heritage with gratitude and honor your parents without being mean or spiteful, say internally to yourself, that by the grace of God, I will take that, and I will develop it, and I will build it much better than when my parents gave it to me.
[time=3426] And for the glory of our God, I will pass it on to my children who will take what I have done, and they will build on it, and they will turn it over to my grandchildren.
[time=3440] Friends, that's how the work of God is done in history.
[time=3446] Father, how simple this work, yet how direct.
[time=3455] Brings us face to face with a heritage of truth and with the investments that have been made in us.
[time=3467] And now as Pastor Hawks comes to close the service, will you help us to respond to your speech in the appropriate way we pray in Jesus name, amen.
[time=3497] We've been sharing with you the special musical ministry of Mirror, the ensemble from the Black Hawk Christian School, and our special guest speaker, Dr. James Greer, from Grand Rapids Bible Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[time=3525] Accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Savior can be the greatest single event in your life.
[time=3530] If you've made that decision today, would you bow your heads and pray this prayer with me? Let's pray together.
[time=3536] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross from my sins.
[time=3543] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3546] I ask you to come into my heart and to forgive me and to cleanse me of the sins that I've committed. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3556] If you prayed that prayer with me this morning, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3561] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3567] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Timeless Insights", please write to the Bible Hour,
