[time=30] Unfortunately, the Bible, like any piece of literature, can be used to prove nearly
[time=53] any point, many valid, some even ridiculous.
[time=58] Even the scene today is a new system of theology.
[time=61] It's called prosperity theology, and it teaches these three principles.
[time=68] One, God always flies first class and so should his people.
[time=73] Two, it's God's will that everyone have good health and great wealth.
[time=80] And finally, you give to get.
[time=86] Unfortunately, all of these points are being sold and bought, but they're all unbiblical.
[time=103] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hobbs.
[time=106] Thank you for spending part of your day with us.
[time=109] The Rick's message today is entitled biblical economics for giving, giving the very word
[time=116] is suspect, direct mail, telephone solicitation, television appeals, and every means conceivable
[time=123] are being used to convey the appeal for financial support.
[time=127] Today it is the hottest issue in the news.
[time=129] The Bible and the very words of Jesus have become the magical passwords to collect money.
[time=135] Today in our fourth study in biblical economics, we will discover that giving is not the backdoor to getting.
[time=141] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study with us.
[time=145] Rick's text is Proverbs chapter 3 verses 9 and 10.
[time=149] Today's special music includes a song from the sanctuary choir, Kathy Hawks, Marilyn Wong,
[time=159] and the Black Hawk Singers.
[time=162] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=171] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=175] Now, here's Rick Hawks.
[time=176] Welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=180] It's Sunday morning we gather here in this place to thank God for His goodness.
[time=185] God's poured out so many blessings on life today.
[time=188] We could take up the hour and more just thanking Him for very specific things that He's done
[time=194] for us today.
[time=196] But in addition to that, God has promised us eternity with Him in heaven.
[time=201] And on that day, we'll stand before the Lord and we'll see Him in all of His glory and
[time=207] we'll be with the Lord.
[time=208] And as a part of heaven, there'll be recognition of one another when Jesus was transfigured on
[time=215] the Mount of Transfiguration.
[time=217] There was Moses and Elijah and Peter and James and John and the Lord and they were all recognizable.
[time=224] We'll not only be with the Lord, but just think of that reunion with loved ones that we've lost here.
[time=231] That's heaven.
[time=232] That's what God's promised to us.
[time=245] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord and we'll be with the Lord and we'll
[time=261] be with the Lord.
[time=264] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord.
[time=270] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord and we'll be with the Lord.
[time=302] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord.
[time=316] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord and we'll be with the Lord.
[time=323] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord.
[time=338] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord and we'll be with the Lord.
[time=357] And as a part of heaven, we'll be with the Lord.
[time=434] Oh, one of the men, when we sing, oh, one of the women.
[time=445] And sing, oh, one of the men, when we sing Jesus.
[time=464] What a privilege that's going to be to stand face to face with our Lord.
[time=474] And say, "Ferris, the Lord Jesus, the ruler of the universe and our Savior." Let's sing about that as we sing together in number 72.
[time=482] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together.

[time=618] [MUSIC]
[time=623] I would like to take a few moments in this service just to explain to you some changes that are taking place that affect all of us here at Black Hawk, but perhaps not so much those of you who are here every Sunday morning at this time.
[time=637] Our church quite obviously has a television camera.
[time=640] Occasionally you have to lean your head a little bit to look around.
[time=644] I catch many of you not watching what's happening up here, but you're watching it in the monitor or the lens of the camera.
[time=651] That's all right.
[time=652] God's given us a great opportunity of outreach through television.
[time=656] We call our television ministry the Bible Hour.
[time=659] It's aired here in Fort Wayne as the real bed and rock bottom of what we do.
[time=664] It's a live broadcast.
[time=666] So what you see is what you get.
[time=668] If I stumber and stammer and fumble over my words, that's exactly what they get.
[time=673] It's all live.
[time=675] And we tape it and send it out to South Bend and Marion where it's seen a week later.
[time=680] We've been doing the live broadcast for about 14 years with Channel 21 WPTA.
[time=686] They have been extraordinarily good friends and helpful to us.
[time=690] They help us get the Bible Hour started and they help us to this very detail of helping us with airtime today.
[time=697] But the station has made a major programming change and they are discontinuing religious broadcasting on Sunday morning from 8 o'clock until noon.
[time=709] That will become effective July the 5th.
[time=712] What that means to us is two different things.
[time=714] First of all, we will not be able to do a live broadcast of our Sunday morning services.
[time=719] It will be a one week delayed broadcast.
[time=723] Secondly, we will be changing airtimes with nothing being available from 8 till noon.
[time=729] We had our choice of times at 5, 6 or at 7 in the morning.
[time=733] I'm a morning person, but I don't think many are up at 5 or 6 and they were so kind at WPTA to give us the first choice.
[time=742] And so we will be taking the 7 to 8 o'clock time frame.
[time=746] And so we are going to be making that move effective July the 5th.
[time=751] Now, we're thankful we can broadcast.
[time=753] God's given us that opportunity.
[time=755] We would really rather be live and we would rather be at 11 o'clock.
[time=759] That's not a choice that we have.
[time=761] So we wanted to let you know that.
[time=763] Secondly, ask you to do one thing and do not do another thing.
[time=767] Let me tell you what we don't want you to do.
[time=769] Whatever you do, don't call WPTA or any of the people there and say, "Why did you make those changes?" Phone calls are very difficult to handle and really only amount of frustration.
[time=781] But what you could do if you are watching the Bible hour or you have occasion as a part of this church to watch it and you find the time change very inconvenient for you, write them and let them know that.
[time=793] If you do write and I encourage you to do so, make sure you're gracious and you thank them for all the help they have been because they are good friends and continue to be.
[time=802] So those changes are coming.
[time=804] Certainly not ones we would have chosen.
[time=806] We wanted to let you know that and ask you as our friends to write if you would be in agreement with us that you would rather see it live at 11 o'clock.
[time=814] But you know, God's in control.
[time=816] If he wanted us on at primetime Sunday night, he could do that.
[time=820] If he wants us on at midnight, he can do that.
[time=822] God's in control.
[time=824] He is our God and we trust him to work through every situation how excellent is our God and how excellent is his name.
[time=832] Above everything else, our God is worthy of praise.
[time=839] How excellent is thy name, oh Lord, how excellent is thy name.
[time=852] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is thy name.
[time=857] How excellent is thy name, oh Lord, how excellent is thy name.
[time=863] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is thy name.
[time=868] And look into them not blue to see the work you've done.
[time=873] Children raise a perfect praise while enemies hold their tongue.
[time=878] Creation shows your splendor, your reign and majesty.
[time=883] And yet I find you take the time to care for one like me.
[time=888] How excellent is thy name, oh Lord, how excellent is thy name.
[time=894] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is thy name.
[time=898] How excellent is thy name, oh Lord, how excellent is thy name.
[time=904] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is thy name.
[time=909] One fine day when the trumpets play and the dead in Christ will rise.
[time=914] The chosen few will gather to proclaim your Lord most time.
[time=919] With joy for hallelujah's a heavenly host will sing.
[time=924] And every knee shall bow, every tongue will shout.
[time=927] You're the king of kings.
[time=930] Excellent is thy name, oh Lord, how excellent is thy name.
[time=935] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is thy name.
[time=940] How excellent is thy name, oh Lord, how excellent is thy name.
[time=945] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is thy name.
[time=950] How excellent is thy name.
[time=959] Hello again and thank you for being a part of the Bible hour today.
[time=969] We're looking forward to spending this hour together, worshiping the Lord and sharing the time with you our friends.
[time=976] It's always great to know you're there by way of television, but we have some special opportunities to be together face to face.
[time=983] The Patriotic Panorama is one of those great opportunities for us.
[time=987] This year, Rick, we're entitleding the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=990] The Songs America Sings and we have a special guest, Carla Whirly, who will be joining the Sanctuary Choir and our special ensembles.
[time=997] It's going to be a great evening of patriotic music as well as some great songs that are sung by our choir that talk about our God.
[time=1005] There's a lot of excitement already brewing.
[time=1008] Well, I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1010] I think that the favorite music in the world for me is the music of our choir.
[time=1013] I love the power and the energy that comes from that, but I'm particularly looking forward to Carla Whirly being here.
[time=1019] I remember her singing with the Bill Gaither group that came to town a number of years ago and we've heard her sing a solo with, I guess you don't sing a solo with anybody, but do that with Larnell Harris, and we're looking forward to that.
[time=1032] Well, she is a great singer, has a great testimony, and I should remind those that are viewing.
[time=1036] If you want to attend the Patriotic Panorama, you do need a ticket.
[time=1039] The tickets are free, and we have concerts at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Sunday, June 28.
[time=1045] If you'd like to receive tickets, you just need to stop at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 7321 East State Boulevard.
[time=1052] There are still a number of tickets available, but they are going rather rapidly.
[time=1056] So plan to call and reserve your tickets and then pick them up as soon as you can.
[time=1060] You know, many of you have been to the Living Christmas Tree, and this is our summer production that in many ways has the same energy and commitment musically
[time=1069] and visually as the Living Christmas Tree, and it's a great opportunity to thank God for America.
[time=1075] We do hope that you can come.
[time=1077] Another special event that gets started this week is our summer Bible conference, and our first speaker is Reverend Bill Heibels.
[time=1085] Bill is the pastor of the Willow Creek Community Church.
[time=1088] The church is only 12 years old, started from scratch, and today there will be around 9 to 10,000 people worshiping there, along with being a great organizer and Bible teacher.
[time=1100] Bill is the chaplain for the World Champion Chicago Bears.
[time=1104] Now I told him that he needed to pray harder than he did last year because they let that slip away from him.
[time=1109] But Bill is a fine man, and I know if you could come to the summer Bible conference, you would be challenged and refreshed.
[time=1115] And then the second week we have Don Gehrig, who is the president of Fort Wayne Bible College, a friend from right here in the community.
[time=1122] So save your Thursday nights and begin spending them with us this Thursday night at 7 o'clock, and we'll have music each of those nights too.
[time=1130] Yes, special music from our own people, soloists and ensembles will be there, and I'm really happy that we have the opportunity to have our services on Thursday night, because of the opportunity for people in our area to come and join us.
[time=1142] So I hope they do come each Thursday night.
[time=1144] It's going to be a great Bible conference this summer.
[time=1147] A few moments ago, I made an announcement that you heard that the Bible hour will be changing time
[time=1153] here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1155] For about 14 years we've been on from 11 o'clock till noon, and starting on July the 5th, the Bible hour will be aired from 7 to 8 in the morning.
[time=1165] That's because of changes in programming at our host station, WPTA.
[time=1170] We're a little bit concerned about that change in time.
[time=1173] We'd prefer to stay at 11 o'clock, but that option wasn't ours.
[time=1176] More than anything else, allow me to express to you that all of the people at WPTA have been so kind to us every meeting we've ever had from day one till now.
[time=1186] There are friends, and we treasure their friendship.
[time=1189] We wish we were staying on at 11 o'clock, and if it's better for you for us to be on at 11, we would encourage you to write them and let them know that.
[time=1199] Please, whatever you do, do not call.
[time=1201] That turns out to be harassment, and that isn't helpful at all.
[time=1205] None of us would like that.
[time=1207] But a letter would let them know how many people really do prefer it at 11 o'clock, and if there aren't that many, then we'll live with the decision and know that it was best.
[time=1215] But if there are many of you, that may help them to reconsider their programming in the days ahead.
[time=1220] You should address your letter to Mr. Ed Medcalf, General Manager WPTA, PO Box 2121 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46801.
[time=1233] Again, if you do write, and I would encourage you to do that, thank them for all the help they've been, and simply ask them to reconsider airing the Bible hour at 11 o'clock.
[time=1244] Again, the address is Mr. Ed Medcalf, General Manager WPTA, PO Box 2121 Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46801.
[time=1258] And do be kind and gracious, and do right, please.
[time=1261] That would be a big help to us.
[time=1263] Finally, before we go back to the Morning Worship Service, I have just come across an excellent booklet that has been very helpful to me that I want to share with you.
[time=1272] It has a simple one-word title, and that is money.
[time=1276] I don't know of any subject that has become more in the foreground than the subject of money amongst Christians and religious broadcasting in particular.
[time=1286] We're going to be talking about that today and next week.
[time=1289] We've been studying a theme called Biblical Economics, and this book does a great job of introducing you to the biblical concept of money and wealth,
[time=1298] and if you'll write to us, we'll send you a copy today.
[time=1301] You can receive the booklet entitled Money by Writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1312] Once again, the title of the booklet is Money.
[time=1315] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1323] Thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1326] We do encourage you to write, and we hope you'll do that.
[time=1329] Thank you.
[time=1359] Thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour.
[time=1382] Thank you so much, as you place it in the master's hand.
[time=1392] Just ordinary people, God uses ordinary people.
[time=1407] He chooses people just like me and you who are willing to do as he commands.
[time=1421] God uses people who will give him all, no matter how small your all may seem to you.
[time=1437] For little becomes much as you place it in the master's hand.
[time=1451] Well, just like that little lad who gave Jesus all he had,
[time=1459] how the multitudes were fed with the fish and loaves of bread.
[time=1466] What you have may not seem much, but when you yield it to the touch of the master's loving hand,
[time=1476] then you'll understand that your life will never be the same.
[time=1488] Just ordinary people, God uses ordinary people.
[time=1504] He chooses people just like me and you who are willing to do as he commands.
[time=1518] God uses people who will give him all, no matter how small your all may seem to you.
[time=1535] For little becomes much as you place it in the master's hand.
[time=1562] In his hand.
[time=1572] Thank you, Marilyn. Let us pray together.
[time=1576] God, thank you that you would be so kind as to use us.
[time=1581] We know that we are ordinary people.
[time=1584] Occasionally we become self-deceived, God, think that we're better than one other person and smarter than another.
[time=1594] We fail to remember we're all made of the same earth and we have the same mortality.
[time=1601] And we are ordinary.
[time=1603] God, thank you that you have blessed us extraordinarily with your son Jesus Christ.
[time=1610] And then you've blessed us again, Lord, to use us.
[time=1613] Use Marilyn to sing or me to teach or the next person to encourage.
[time=1618] God, thanks that we have the privilege of being used by you.
[time=1622] God, I know that we are not adequate in ourselves, but you've given us that.
[time=1628] And we thank you.
[time=1630] We pray today that you'll give to those whose self-esteem is so low and they feel inadequate,
[time=1636] a sense that you love them and that adequacy is not in self but in relationship to you.
[time=1644] Father, we would also pray for those that we love who today are suffering.
[time=1649] We pray for Jenny and Cecil Lawson that you'll comfort them in the death of Jenny's father.
[time=1656] And for Sue Moran, as she recovers from surgery and Dave, as he recovers from an unknown infection,
[time=1665] we would pray today for those who are emotionally imprisoned.
[time=1669] Some by their own sin, others by things that have happened to them.
[time=1674] God, we ask you to set the captives free to heal damaged relationships.
[time=1682] We pray particularly for those who are walking alone in life.
[time=1686] Many of the elderly who so rarely have anyone call on them who simply loves them.
[time=1693] God help them to sense your presence in your love and make of us better callers, better carers.
[time=1701] Father, we today thank you that you care for us, that you love us even though we are just ordinary people.
[time=1709] We thank you for your love.
[time=1712] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1723] ♪
[time=1739] The Father lost what we need, no need to worry or doubt.
[time=1755] For all of nature is sent by His end.
[time=1768] But far beyond what we need, He knows the things we desire.
[time=1783] And as my faith be approaching, we know.
[time=1796] He'll hear our prayer.
[time=1805] The birth of the end, the release of the field.
[time=1819] Our fair and broad by Him.
[time=1833] We'll maintain the time to care for them.
[time=1848] Surely we'll care for you.
[time=1866] The Father knows what we need, no need to worry or doubt.
[time=1882] For all of nature is sent by His end.
[time=1895] But far beyond what we need, He knows the things we desire.
[time=1910] And as my faith we are approaching, we know.
[time=1923] He'll hear our prayer.
[time=1940] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=1962] Today we are continuing a series of messages out of the Book of Proverbs on Biblical Economics.
[time=1969] You may remember that we talked about contentment, we talked about the value of labor, we talked about the value of planning and saving.
[time=1978] Today we come to the topic of what does God say in the Bible, particularly the Book of Proverbs, about giving.
[time=1986] Now before we even get into that, we really need to talk a little bit about what the Bible doesn't say about giving.
[time=1994] There's probably not anything that's talked about more today in Christianity than financial affairs and giving to churches, television ministries, charitable organizations.
[time=2007] Someone has said, I've heard it often, you've heard it too, that you can prove anything from the Bible.
[time=2013] And they're right. You can prove anything from the Scripture as long as, would you like last Sunday's bulletin, as long as you're willing to take it out of context.
[time=2023] You're willing to take it out of context, you can prove anything.
[time=2026] Perhaps you've heard some of these stories before.
[time=2029] Do you know the Bible talks about tennis? It really does.
[time=2033] Some of you didn't know tennis was that old, but it says back in Exodus that Moses served in Pharaoh's court.
[time=2041] We don't know who got the point, but that's the first mention of tennis in the Scriptures.
[time=2046] The Bible also speaks about motorcycle racing.
[time=2049] It says in the book of 1 Samuel that after David Sulu Goliath, that his triumph was heard throughout the land.
[time=2059] You know, he just kicked that thing and low gear and ran up those Judean hills, they heard that triumph.
[time=2064] It talks about baseball.
[time=2066] It says, in the big ending, God created the heavens and the earth.
[time=2072] Now, those I can tolerate, those have been around for years, but this new one I find it hard to swallow.
[time=2082] Did you know, who's yours, that Indiana University is mentioned in the pages of the Bible?
[time=2094] John chapter 20, Jesus said, "As the Father has sent me so send I you."
[time=2105] You know what? If you're willing to do that, you can prove anything out of the Bible.
[time=2114] You really can.
[time=2116] You just have to take something out of context, turn its meaning, use it how you'd like to.
[time=2121] You can prove anything out of the Bible.
[time=2123] You can prove anything out of the Koran, the Muslim writings.
[time=2127] You can prove anything out of the Gettysburg Address if you were determined to do that if you're simply willing to disregard content.
[time=2138] As we come to the study of what God says about giving, there is probably, in my opinion, and I know this is my opinion,
[time=2147] but they're allowed to give their opinion, so I'll feel free to give mine today.
[time=2158] It's all been thrown under a label today, and it's a good label.
[time=2161] Let me give that to you. It's called the theology of prosperity.
[time=2166] Here's how it goes. Three basic things, the theology of prosperity teaches.
[time=2171] Principle number one, God always flies first class and so should his people.
[time=2180] Principle number two, it's God's will that everybody have good health and great wealth.
[time=2189] Principle number three is you give to get.
[time=2196] Now, that is being broadcast, that's being printed, that is being sold and bought like nothing in Christianity has ever been marketed to before.
[time=2206] Now, God tells us why, because in 1 Timothy and in 2 Timothy, we are warned about teachers who will come along,
[time=2216] and what they will teach is systematically presenting exactly what people want to hear.
[time=2223] To be honest with you, I would love to believe God's will was for me to fly first class throughout life.
[time=2232] And I'd love to think that God wants to give me good health and great wealth, and it's there for the asking, not for the taking, but for the giving.
[time=2242] The King James Bible puts it this way, that people have itching ears.
[time=2246] Now, that doesn't mean they scratch, it means this, that we tend to gravitate towards those speakers who metaphorically are tickling us with what they're saying.
[time=2263] Now, is the theology of prosperity correct? Let's very quickly look at it point by point.
[time=2270] First of all, God always flies first class and so should his people.
[time=2277] Now, if you wanted to put somebody down as being kind of crude and rude and backwardsy, you might say to them,
[time=2283] "Man, what's wrong with you? Are you born in a barn?" You know what? When God came to this world and the person of Jesus Christ, he was born in a barn. That's first class.
[time=2298] Then, once the baby Jesus was born, they put him in a manger.
[time=2303] Now, I know most of you are city slickers like me. You don't have the foggiest idea what a manger is.
[time=2310] There's only one association with a manger in my life, and that's the verse of the scripture and the little children song that goes all way in a manger, no crib for a bed.
[time=2320] I didn't know what a manger was, they might as well said, "Away in a bassinet, no crib for a bed." It didn't make any sense to me.
[time=2328] City slickers, here's what a manger is. It is a feeding trough.
[time=2335] It is a trough that grain or hay would be thrown into, and animals would come up to and eat out of and saliva would fall into.
[time=2347] And into that was the first bed of the baby Jesus flying first class.
[time=2356] Later on in his life, Christ was being questioned a little bit antagonistically, but a man was considering following Christ, and the Lord didn't say, "You come follow me, because in my billfold, I've got credit cards to all the major hotels in the world, and when we travel, man do we travel."
[time=2377] Jesus said these words of warning. He said, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air, they have nests."
[time=2385] But speaking of himself, he says, "The son of man has nowhere to lay his head."
[time=2392] I like what Shadrach Meshach Lockridge said. He said, "When the Lord Jesus died, he had to be put into a borrowed tomb, but that's okay. He wasn't staying long."
[time=2407] Jesus didn't fly first class. There were days when he did have some semblance of affluent, when that costly perfume and oil was broken and spilled out.
[time=2418] Yes. Did he ever have an elegant meal? The scripture speaks of him going to wedding feast.
[time=2425] But daily, no, he was lowly, he was humble. The Bible says he was despised and rejected of men.
[time=2435] God does not always fly first class.
[time=2442] Secondly, is it God's will that everyone have good health and great wealth?
[time=2447] Well, is it fair for me to assume that the apostle Paul served the Lord and had as much faith and obedience to God as any of us?
[time=2457] I think that's safe to assume. Second Corinthians tells us that Paul prayed three times. He said, "God, I've got this thorn in my flesh."
[time=2468] Now, that was a metaphor. He didn't have a thistle that got stuck. That was an expression saying, "A physical problem."
[time=2475] And he said, "I prayed three times for God to take it away, and each time God said no." Why?
[time=2484] God said, "Because my grace is sufficient for you. I will not give you the good health you want, but I will give you the grace to endure the poor health that you have."
[time=2495] Why? God said, "Because my power is more clearly seen through a person with weaknesses than a person with all assets."
[time=2508] God didn't give good health to the apostle Paul. Did God give great wealth to everybody?
[time=2518] Boy, Solomon had it. That's who we're reading today. He had it coming by the boatload. His palace was elegant, perhaps extravagant.
[time=2530] Did God do that for everyone? Well, Jesus said these words, "There is none born a woman greater than John the Baptist."
[time=2542] Now, you want to talk about a fat cat, John the Baptist. I mean, this guy was a sight walking around in sheep skins, eating a diet, anybody ready for lunch, of honey and wild locusts.
[time=2557] You take a few locusts, dump a little honey on it, munch him down, and he lived out in the wilderness walking around saying, "Repent. No wonder he didn't win a popularity contest. Great wealth. One sheep skin and a locust diet."
[time=2575] He didn't have great wealth, but Christ said, "Of all human beings, he was the greatest. It is not God's will for us all to have great wealth and good health."
[time=2586] Finally, do you get to give? We're in Proverbs chapter 3. Let's study that scripture at length today.
[time=2594] Proverbs 3 verses 9 and 10 are the heart of our study. Allow me to read those for you from the new international version. It begins like this.
[time=2603] "Honor the Lord." If you don't get anything else today, just think about this for the rest of the day.
[time=2610] "Honor the Lord with your wealth with the first fruits of all your crops, then your barns will be filled over flowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine."
[time=2627] Now, we've been studying Proverbs here at Black Hawk since February. If you like it, the good news is we're not even halfway done with the study. If you don't like it, please be patient.
[time=2639] But back in February, we gave you some principles about Proverbs that I need to remind you today. This is the key principle for you to have.
[time=2649] A proverb is not a promise. Remember that. A proverb is not a promise. A proverb is a short general statement that is usually true.
[time=2666] But it's not a promise that it's guaranteed to be true every time. Let me give you some illustration, some very common illustration.
[time=2676] Proverbs 15 one says, "A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up even more anger."
[time=2689] Is that true? Sure is. If somebody is angry with you and you treat them kindly and give them a soft answer, it will have a soothing healing effect on the whole relationship.
[time=2701] And if somebody is angry at you and you simply spit back, "Oh, that will escalate it." That proverb is generally true. Is it always true? No.
[time=2715] The Lord Jesus gave a soft answer, and they killed him for it. But it's generally true. Proverbs 22 6 says, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he's old, he will not depart from it."
[time=2730] Is that generally true? Generally it's true. Is it always true? Not always.
[time=2738] Occasionally I see a young man or a young lady who has departed from godliness, and their parents have trained them and trained them well, and they've departed.
[time=2747] That's a rarity. And occasionally I've seen some parents who did a terrible job, have some of the sharpest, most godly kids, but don't bank on it.
[time=2759] Generally we reproduce what we are and what we teach. Now that's the difference between a proverb and a promise.
[time=2770] A promise is this one, "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Not most, but all who call upon the name of the Lord. That's a promise.
[time=2783] So what we're reading today is a proverb. It is generally true, but it is not a money-back guarantee. Let's look at what it says. I'm going to show you three things.
[time=2794] A principle, a particular, and a proverb. The principle is this. In the English Bible, the first three words, "Honor the Lord."
[time=2807] That's the theme of the Bible from the beginning of Genesis all the way to the end of Revelation. Our life has but one purpose. That's the honor and the glorified God.
[time=2818] That's why He made you. That's why He made me to honor and glorify Him. Do you ever stop and think if God is all sufficient why He made us? It wasn't because He needed to.
[time=2830] He made us, the Bible says, for Himself. That we might glorify Him. Revelation chapter 4 verse 11. Christ is on the throne in heaven. John sees it all and around Him are beings of praise.
[time=2849] And here's what they say, "Worthy, art thou, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and blessing and power." Why? For you have created all things, and for thy pleasure they were and are created.
[time=2871] We live in an age of, in a big word, a philosophical eclecticism. That means that we indiscriminately take a little of this philosophy and a little of that. We just take from each philosophy what we like and what we don't like. Who pitch it?
[time=2887] One man described himself this way. He said, "I guess I'm what you would call a Christian atheist. You cannot be a Christian atheist. You are either a Christian or you are an atheist.
[time=2900] But you cannot be both." That's like saying, "I am a very tall, short person." You're either a tall person or you're a short person but you're not both. You either are or you aren't.
[time=2915] But in our society we love to collect all the different religious strains and most of them are boiling down into a religious version of existentialism which says life only has its meaning in your personal fulfillment.
[time=2933] That's not new. You can go all the way back to Plato and the Socrates. Plato reasoned that simply being is enough and out of the fact that you exist you do something but just the fact that you be alive is enough.
[time=2949] Your student Aristotle argued just the opposite. He said, "No, your meaning and your existence comes from what you do." Frank Sinatra as you've probably heard some that all up and Plato said, "To be is to do." Aristotle said, "To do is to be." Sinatra said, "Do be, do be, do."
[time=2973] You know what God says? God says, "You don't exist for yourself. You don't have to have some type of personal experience that makes you significant. You don't have to amass great wealth. You don't have to have letters behind your name that nobody else knows what they mean to be important.
[time=2996] Your value in life is not because you produce more than anybody else in your department. God says your value is contingent upon one thing that you honor me with your life. That's what life is all about.
[time=3012] And life is paradoxical. You see, if you seek for personal fulfillment, you will never find it. Personal fulfillment is only a byproduct that you gain through honoring the Lord. And if you try to get fulfillment apart from honoring God, you'll come up with existential emptiness.
[time=3034] But if you honor God first in your life, here's what you'll find. You'll find that John 10 makes sense when Jesus said, "I'm come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly."
[time=3048] You'll find that 1 John chapter 1 verse 4 is true when it said, "These things I write unto you that your joy may be full." You'll find it what David said in the Psalms is real.
[time=3062] When he encouraged us, invited us with these words, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good." There is a principle here. It is to honor the Lord.
[time=3078] That is what God wants from each of us. How do you honor the Lord?
[time=3084] Well, last Sunday I heard one of the finest messages on that word honor that we don't ever hear in your life from Jim Greer.
[time=3092] He sat in a nutshell to honor is to bring your life into moral continuity.
[time=3101] He was talking about parents and children. For my son to honor me is to order his values exactly like mine.
[time=3110] For me to honor my Heavenly Father is to bring my life and my values into harmony with his. That's how you honor the Lord.
[time=3120] Now, that's the principle honor the Lord. Here comes a particular. It's given as a particular and then underlined.
[time=3130] Here's the particular. Honor the Lord with your wealth with the first fruits of your crops. Those are two prepositional phrases.
[time=3142] One tells us a way to honor the Lord. The second one tells us how to do the first one.
[time=3147] Honor the Lord with your wealth. To honor God with your wealth means far more than to take an animal.
[time=3153] If you're an Old Testament Jew bring them over here to the temple and say sacrifice it for me Levi.
[time=3159] Or if you're a modern day Christian it means more than reaching in your bill full and putting dollars into the offering plate.
[time=3166] Not putting that down but that is not what it means to honor the Lord with your money or your wealth.
[time=3175] What it means to honor the Lord with your money is to bring your view of money into moral continuity with what God has said about money in his word.
[time=3186] Let me try to give you these in very rapid fire. One way that we honor the Lord is to recognize God's ownership over everything.
[time=3197] Psalm 24 one puts it this way. The earth is the Lord and everything in it. The world and all who are in it.
[time=3204] That says God owns the globe. He owns all the things in it and he owns all the people in it.
[time=3213] You see it changes from everything impersonal to all who, personal.
[time=3219] I've got a lovely wife. Three of the greatest kids a man could ever want but I need to remember they are not mine. They are the Lord's.
[time=3230] I have a nice car. I'm thankful for it. It is not mine. It too is the Lord's.
[time=3238] And we honor God with our wealth when we decline ownership.
[time=3243] And we say I'm just the tenant here. God owns it.
[time=3248] Second way we honor God is to regard his value system.
[time=3252] Just a few verses lower will illustrate this. Verse 13 it says bless it is the man who finds wisdom. The man who gains understanding for she wisdom is more profitable than silver and yields better return than gold.
[time=3266] Our value system says money, stocks, securities, cars, houses, properties, intangibles, collect as many as you can. The yuppies put it this way.
[time=3275] The one who dies with the most toys wins. God's value system is this. Don't let the rich man boast in his riches but let him boast in this that he knows me.
[time=3292] Knowing God, wisdom, righteousness, contentment, love and peace. You want to honor God with wealth? Place your value system over here and not over here.
[time=3301] Third way to honor God with your wealth is to remember to be generous. Proverbs, I'll just read this for you quickly. Proverbs 14, 31 says this.
[time=3311] He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for the maker but whosoever is kind to the needy honors the Lord.
[time=3321] How can you honor God with your wealth by being generous with it? That's how you honor God.
[time=3328] To take what you have and to hold it loosely and to give it freely. Proverbs 19, 17 says he who is kind to the poor lends to the Lord and he the Lord will reward him for what he has done.
[time=3344] Here's one of the great paradoxes of life. The more you get, the harder it is to give. Proverbs 11, 24 says one man gives freely gains even more.
[time=3357] He sends it up, somehow he's got more. Another man withholds unduly. He saves it, he miserly keeps it for himself and it's not enough.
[time=3370] Enough, if what you have today is not enough, it probably never will be.
[time=3382] The particular gets more particular. Not only you honor God with our money but it says honor him with our first fruits.
[time=3389] To the farmer that meant the first harvest the crop went to the Lord or the first born of the livestock.
[time=3395] It simply says that when it comes time to manage your money, we give to God first.
[time=3400] Ron Blue in his excellent book Mastering Money says there's only five things you can do with money.
[time=3405] One, you can pay taxes. Two, you can reduce debt. Three, you can save it. Four, you can spend it on a lifestyle and five, you can give it away.
[time=3417] In our American economy, here's our batting order. One, spend it on a lifestyle. Two, pay off the minimum on the credit card so you can keep doing number one, spend it on a lifestyle.
[time=3430] Three, pay taxes. Four, save if you've already bought and everything you want and you don't know what to do with your money.
[time=3436] Then finally, if you have to, give it away. God says, give to him first.
[time=3454] We've just shared with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, the Black Hawk Singers and soloist Marilyn Wong and Kathy Hawks.
[time=3462] Our message today was from our own pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3465] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3471] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer and I'd like to have you pray it along with me. Let's bow our heads together.
[time=3478] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3485] And today I know that I have a need in my heart for Christ to come in and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3492] I ask you to come in today. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3497] If you prayed that prayer with me today, would you write us and tell us that you did that?
[time=3502] And when you write us, we'll send you a booklet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3509] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Money", please write to the Bible Hour, about 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
