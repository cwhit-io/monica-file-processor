[time=0] [bell]
[time=30] [bell] You struggle, and struggle, and struggle.
[time=59] And just about the time you catch up with the Joneses, they refinance.
[time=65] [MUSIC]
[time=69] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=83] Thank you for joining us.
[time=85] Our next sermon today is entitled, "critical economic spy." Mastering our money may be the biggest spiritual battle many of us fight.
[time=94] The more we have, the more we spend, and the more our debts increase.
[time=99] It is surprising that increased wealth does not bring increased financial freedom but increased debt.
[time=106] In our study of Proverbs today, we will look at what God has said about borrowing and lending.
[time=112] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study with us.
[time=116] Our special music today includes a song from the sanctuary choir, and Keith and Starr Bratigou.
[time=123] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=130] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=133] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=137] Now here's Rick.
[time=139] Welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=143] It was a thrill to be a part of the first worship service.
[time=146] I was a little bit tired myself.
[time=148] You have those Sunday mornings, don't you?
[time=150] And our choir came alive with this next anthem of praise.
[time=154] I don't know enough about music to tell you what it is, but there are two, three, four parts.
[time=159] It does everything a song should do, including waking up the congregation, waking up the preacher,
[time=166] but most of all, honoring the Lord.
[time=169] So it's a joy to hear them sing again and to share with you the ministry of our choir this morning.
[time=196] [MUSIC]
[time=203] From the dawn and the time.
[time=212] Through the ages of mankind,
[time=220] He held his glory and answered it with praise.
[time=234] But first, we'll have a last, so shall we ever be.
[time=248] For me, our praise grew out in time and day.
[time=263] And his face goes on forever.
[time=270] The song grew out in Trinity, his glory to his name.
[time=278] We will praise his name and evermore proclaim.
[time=287] And his face goes on forever.
[time=294] The song grew out in Trinity, his glory to his name.
[time=302] We will praise his name and evermore proclaim.
[time=456] Amen. Praise the Lord in holy, holy songs of joy.
[time=467] Hallelujah what a Savior we have because of his sacrifice on Calvary.
[time=471] We're going to sing all five verses please of him number 184.
[time=475] Hallelujah what a Savior 184.
[time=486] Hallelujah.
[time=506] Hallelujah what a Savior we have.
[time=602] And each Sunday we come to celebrate the wonderful works of our Savior and what He's done in our lives.
[time=608] Thank you for joining us and singing.
[time=610] It's an inspiration to us as we hear you sing together.
[time=614] I'd like to remind you that the patriotic panorama is just two weeks away.
[time=618] King's America sings.
[time=620] June 28th at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
[time=623] there are tickets still available at the reception desk.
[time=626] We encourage you to pick yours up today.
[time=629] Special guest will be Carla Worley.
[time=631] You'll enjoy her music.
[time=633] She's a marvelous singer as a lovely testimony and is a real inspiration to those that hear her as well as the sanctuary choir and ensembles that will be performing.
[time=644] Today we have some sort of a homecoming.
[time=646] Keith and Starr brought him with us.
[time=648] We claim them as our own here at Blackhawk.
[time=650] But Keith and Starr have been away at Indiana University.
[time=653] Keith studying for his doctorate in music.
[time=655] He's completed his coursework and will work very hard this summer in preparing for final exams and then a paper.
[time=662] He'll be completing his work for a doctorate in music.
[time=665] We love them.
[time=666] We appreciate their music and testimony and we're glad that you're here today.
[time=670] Keith and Starr, the Lord bless you as you sing for us.
[time=676] [MUSIC] Holy, holy, holy [MUSIC] O'er the whole mighty [MUSIC] We're in the morning [MUSIC] Our song shall rise today [MUSIC] Holy, holy, holy [MUSIC] Lucifer and mighty [MUSIC] All in three persons [MUSIC] Blessed shall it be [MUSIC]
[time=742] [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=847] [APPLAUSE]
[time=854] It's a privilege each week to be able to share our morning worship services here at Blackhawk with you friends who join us by way of television.
[time=863] Pete, how are things coming along for the panorama?
[time=866] Well, Rick, we're in the final stages of just fine-tuning all of the music and making sure that our sets are ready.
[time=872] We'll be looking forward to putting it all together in the next two weeks.
[time=876] I'd like to remind those of you that are watching that the 14th Annual Patriotic Panorama is June 28.
[time=882] The concerts are at five o'clock and eight o'clock, and there are some tickets left.
[time=887] If you'd like to receive free tickets, but you need a ticket to get into the concerts, you can write to the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 7321 East State Boulevard.
[time=897] That's Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=899] Zip code is 46815.
[time=901] Or better yet, just call the church at 749-8524.
[time=906] There are tickets left, but you need to do that this week so that you can ensure yourself of getting some.
[time=912] Thank you, and we do hope you will be able to join us for the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=917] Last week we made a very important announcement, and we're going to need to repeat this each week so that we can keep you up to date and informed.
[time=925] The Bible Hour has been on live here on Channel 21 in Fort Wayne for about 14 years.
[time=932] We will be changing times as of July the 5th.
[time=936] So there's just a few more Sundays we're on at 11 o'clock, but on July the 5th we will then be broadcasting at 7 to 8 a.m. on Sunday mornings.
[time=946] So please make note of that time change on July the 5th.
[time=950] This is a decision that was not ours, but an option that was given to us because we were no longer being offered the 11 o'clock hour.
[time=958] The people at WPTA have made that programming decision independent of our wishes,
[time=964] and we understand that, but regret it greatly.
[time=967] And if you like, we are disappointed, we encourage you to write them and let them know that in a very gracious and kind way.
[time=974] Thank them for the help they've been in broadcasting the Bible Hour and let them know of your disappointment that it's no longer live or is it no longer going to be on at 11 o'clock.
[time=983] You could write to Mr. Ed Medcalf, the general manager at Box 21-21
[time=990] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468-01.
[time=994] We hope that you will continue to watch the Bible Hour regardless of what city you're in or what time it comes on, and we can continue to have a ministry of God's Word and of Christian music in your life.
[time=1007] Over the past few weeks, we've been teaching what the Bible says about money.
[time=1012] That's a very critical subject today, particularly in the field of religious broadcasting, as there's been so much said about finances.
[time=1020] That's really not our point.
[time=1022] What we're looking at is what do you do as an individual to earn money?
[time=1027] How do you use money?
[time=1029] How do you control your spending?
[time=1031] We've talked a lot about work and contentment.
[time=1034] Today, we'll talk about debt and what the Bible has to say about debt, but there's an excellent book written by Phil Yancy with the simple one-word title, Money.
[time=1045] This is not a "How to Get Rich Quick" book.
[time=1048] This is a simple, straightforward, biblical look at what God has to say about this very critical area of our lives, money.
[time=1056] If you'd like a copy, simply write to us today.
[time=1060] You can receive your copy of the booklet entitled Money by writing to the Bible Hour.
[time=1065] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1072] Once again, that's the Bible Hour.
[time=1074] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1079] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1083] I hope you've enjoyed Keith and Starr, people from our church who are now living out of town back to minister to you and to us, and we're delighted that they're here, and we're looking forward to their ministry again now as we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1113] John Jordan's story bangs, I stand.
[time=1120] A cast of wishful light, two cadence fair and heavy land where my possessions lie.
[time=1134] I am bound for the promised land.
[time=1139] Oh, who will come and go with me?
[time=1148] I am bound for the promised land.
[time=1155] Oh, who's wide-expanded place?
[time=1166] My 20th and old day, there God the sun forever rains and scratches lie to wave.
[time=1174] I am bound for the promised land.
[time=1184] Oh, who will come and go with me?
[time=1189] I am bound for the promised land.
[time=1196] While child I teach that family's place, be forever blessed.
[time=1205] When child I see my Father's face, and in his goes of rest.
[time=1217] I am bound for the promised land.
[time=1229] Oh, who will come and go with me?
[time=1235] I am bound for the promised land.
[time=1260] Thank you very much and it is indeed a privilege for Star and I to be back home in Fort Wayne again today.
[time=1273] It is a wonderful privilege to be participating in sharing the love and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[time=1280] and we look forward to the communion service this evening and participating in that way.
[time=1284] Philippians 4.19 says, "My God shall supply all our needs according to his riches and glory in Christ Jesus."
[time=1291] He giveth more grace.
[time=1303] He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater.
[time=1316] He sendeth more strength when the labors increase.
[time=1324] To add an affliction he added his mercy to multiply trials, his wanted light peace.
[time=1342] For his love has no limit, his grace has no measure,
[time=1351] his power has no boundary, no long to mend.
[time=1359] For out of his infinite riches in Jesus,
[time=1371] he giveth and giveth and giveth again.
[time=1392] We have exhausted our store of endurance when our strength has failed,
[time=1403] here the days have done when we reach the end of our hoarded resources.
[time=1416] Our Father's forgiving is only way gone.
[time=1425] For his love has no limit, his grace has no measure,
[time=1434] his power has no boundary, no long to mend.
[time=1442] For out of his infinite riches in Jesus,
[time=1457] he giveth and giveth, and he giveth again.
[time=1487] God, we thank you today for your grace that you give and you give again.
[time=1499] We thank you for the graciousness of Star's voice and more so over spirit.
[time=1505] The way a song can speak to us and penetrate to our very soul and deal with us at the very issues of life.
[time=1516] God, it's because of that grace that you repetitiously and faithfully give, that we've come to worship you today and to praise you.
[time=1526] We thank you that out of grace you created us.
[time=1529] Out of grace you have bought us back from the very slave market of sin.
[time=1534] Out of grace Christ came to die for us, that we might know forgiveness.
[time=1540] And so today God, we come to worship not your grace but you who gave the grace.
[time=1546] Yet God embarrassingly so, we've also come to ask for more grace.
[time=1552] We ask for grace today for those parts of this body who are physically suffering today.
[time=1558] For Brad as he continues to recover from surgery, for Francis as she feels confined by arthritis,
[time=1565] for Joy Madden as she battles for her health.
[time=1569] God, we would pray for your grace.
[time=1572] Father, we would pray for grace today for those who have grabbed a hold of tough problems.
[time=1580] Some they have created others, they've only inherited them from predecessors but in their business.
[time=1585] These are difficult days and they feel so responsible not only for their future but the future of others.
[time=1594] For their business and the company and those that are affected.
[time=1599] God, we ask you to give wisdom to their minds in grace for the battle.
[time=1605] God, we ask you to give grace to those ladies who are raising children.
[time=1610] Some are not alone but as little responses their husbands give they might as well be.
[time=1618] God, give them grace to be patient with us, husband who is not responsive and grace to raised children.
[time=1627] God, give grace to that man who is the victim of unfaithfulness.
[time=1633] God, we would ask that you would give grace to those who of their own choosing have stepped out into sin.
[time=1640] God, we ask you to give them grace even though they may not be asking for it today.
[time=1645] Give them the grace to recognize their sin and to seek forgiveness.
[time=1651] God, we ask you to give grace today in the form of insight as we learn to master our money
[time=1657] that we would not be possessed by our money, that we would not even possess it.
[time=1664] We would simply recognize that it is yours and honor you with our wealth.
[time=1669] For it's in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1674] If you have your Bible, we are going to be studying from Proverbs today but we're going to start in the Book of Exodus, the 22nd chapter.
[time=1685] While you're looking for that, let me just update those of you who may not have worshiped or studied with us over the last few weeks.
[time=1693] We're studying through the Book of Proverbs, noticing its major themes and its specific applications to life.
[time=1701] As we've gone through Proverbs, we are now looking at the economic principles, biblical economics that are being taught there.
[time=1709] And we've talked about the value of working and earning our income.
[time=1716] We've talked about the priority of commitment and if we don't have commitment, it doesn't matter what other principles we learn, they will not serve us well.
[time=1724] We've talked about saving and planning and giving and being of a generous heart but today we're going to come to what modern economists now call the eighth wonder of the world.
[time=1738] Those of you who are students of history remember that there are seven wonders of the ancient world.
[time=1743] The hanging gardens of Babylon were one, the great Pyramid of Egypt was another.
[time=1749] And so we moderns have our seven wonders of the modern world.
[time=1753] Great structures like the Eiffel Tower.
[time=1758] But economists now label something as the eighth wonder of the world.
[time=1762] It is called the magic of compounding interest.
[time=1767] Let me explain to you with two examples how the magic of compounding interest works.
[time=1773] A positive example and then a not so positive one.
[time=1777] Positively look at these numbers.
[time=1780] If you're 20 years old today and you began depositing $1,000 a year, $20 a week,
[time=1790] if you deposited that into a high yield savings program at 12 and a half percent.
[time=1798] Now I know that's probably not achievable today but eight years ago when these stats were put together that was standard interest.
[time=1805] But if you put $1,000 in the bank at 12 and a half percent interest, it would earn 12 and a half percent this year and the next year and the next year.
[time=1814] And it would earn interest on that $1,000 plus the previous interest.
[time=1819] And every year it just keeps going and going and going.
[time=1822] If you did that for 40 years, you would have taken out of your pocket $1,000 a year for 40 years.
[time=1831] You would have spent out of your spending into your savings $40,000.
[time=1839] At 12 and a half percent interest at age 60, your $40,000 would return to you $1,000,000.
[time=1850] That's the magic of compounding.
[time=1852] It even goes further than at age 60 if you kept that money in the bank and you stopped compounding the interest
[time=1859] and started living off the interest, you could have in interest an annual salary of $125,000.
[time=1868] To live on without ever touching that million dollars.
[time=1872] That's the magic of compounding.
[time=1874] That's when you are on the investment side of the borrowing lending scheme.
[time=1882] Allow me to give you a negative example of how the magic of compounding works against you.
[time=1888] Let's do it on a very household basis, something most of us understand.
[time=1892] Let's suppose you wanted to buy a house today and you went to the bank and you borrowed $45,000 to buy your house.
[time=1901] First of all, that's a relatively small mortgage.
[time=1905] So these are very conservative numbers.
[time=1907] If you borrowed it at 10% interest on a 30-year loan, your payments would be divided into four parts, taxes and insurance.
[time=1923] Then two other parts called principal and interest.
[time=1926] Principles that $45,000 you borrowed, interest is how much you are paying the institute that you borrowed it from for the privilege of borrowing it.
[time=1936] First of all, you will discover that you will have a $400 a month payment and during your first year you will pay $12,400 payments or $4,800.
[time=1949] And at the end of paying $4,800 you will have repaid less than $100 of the $45,000 you borrowed.
[time=1959] It is all interest.
[time=1961] And if you sold the house, you would still own everything you borrowed.
[time=1965] And if you are now in the 10th year of that 30-year loan, you will have paid them already your $45,000 and you will still owe them $42,000.
[time=1978] And at the end of 30 years when you have paid them $144,000 for the $45 you borrowed, they will say congratulations.
[time=1994] You now own your home.
[time=1996] It is so old and worn out.
[time=1998] We will be glad to loan you another $45,000 so you can remodel it.
[time=2005] And don't count on 10% interest.
[time=2008] That is the magic of compounding when it works against you.
[time=2013] The Bible doesn't get into percentage rates per se, but it gives us some tremendous insight in biblical economics about borrowing and lending.
[time=2028] Before we do get into the accurate advice, we need to give you an ancient perspective.
[time=2035] So here is Exodus chapter 22.
[time=2037] I got so excited about the magic of compounding that I haven't found Exodus 22 yet.
[time=2042] Exodus 22.
[time=2044] Those big numbers are hard for our literature and our history major.
[time=2048] Exodus 21, 22.
[time=2050] Alright, here is chapter 22 verse 25.
[time=2055] God is writing through Moses to his people.
[time=2058] It says, "If you lend money to one of my people among you, who is needy, do not be like a money lender, charge him no interest.
[time=2068] If you take your neighbor's cloak as pledge, return it to him by sundown because his cloak is his only covering for his body.
[time=2076] What else will he sleep in?" The ancient Israelites had a unique economy.
[time=2083] Here was the situation.
[time=2085] A needy Israelite, a fellow countryman, a brother.
[time=2089] He's destitute.
[time=2091] And you're going to loan him either food or money.
[time=2095] Your interest rate is to be zero.
[time=2100] Now that was shocking for Moses' day.
[time=2103] There's a group of scholars that we call archeologists.
[time=2106] They go over into parts of the world, particularly the Middle East, and they dig through the sand until they find relics and artifacts and monuments and documents.
[time=2116] They've even found libraries that give us a wealth of insight into the biblical times.
[time=2121] If you lived in Babylon and you borrowed food or a product, your interest rate is 33 and 1/3%.
[time=2135] But you and I think in terms of what are called APRs, that stands for annual percentage rate.
[time=2141] They had what were called DPRs, daily percentage rates.
[time=2147] That was 33 and 1/3% a day.
[time=2153] That meant if you knocked on my door and said, "Could I borrow three cups of sugar?"
[time=2159] I would say gladly. And at the end of that day you would owe me four cups of sugar.
[time=2166] And if you failed to pay that day, tomorrow you would owe me five and one-third cups of sugar.
[time=2174] And if you failed to pay me at sundown that day, by the third day I would have doubled my loan to you.
[time=2181] That's the magic of compounding.
[time=2186] Babylon was not as bad as a sister city called Newsyup.
[time=2190] They kept the math simple.
[time=2193] If you borrowed something, 50% interest rate.
[time=2197] You borrowed a pound of barley, at sundown you owe me a pound and a half.
[time=2202] And tomorrow you owe me two and a quarter pounds.
[time=2207] So if you kept it more than one day, it doubled already.
[time=2211] It's like the new form the IRS has come out with. Many of you won't need the assistance of your accountants next year.
[time=2217] They've got a brand new simple form. It's two lines. Top line said, "How much did you make?" Next line said, "Send it all in." Really simple. Keep it down to the basics.
[time=2229] That's how they did it, Newsyup.
[time=2231] "Borrow a cup of sugar, tomorrow give me everything you own." You can see how revolutionary the scripture is.
[time=2239] It says, "Charge no interest to a fellow countrymen." Let me give you some other idiosyncrasies of the Israeli loaning system.
[time=2248] And I don't mean they're idiotic, just that they are unique.
[time=2251] First of all, these loans are loans given to the needy.
[time=2254] These are not joint ventures where you're putting up the capital and they're putting up the labor.
[time=2259] These are loans to the needy.
[time=2261] Secondly, these were loans that were expected to be paid back at the end of the day.
[time=2266] For example, if I came to my friend Steve, and I said, "Steve, we have no barley.
[time=2271] Would you loan us an e-fought of barley for the day?" And I will work in the fields in green, and tonight I will pay you back.
[time=2279] You might say to me, "I know that you are needy." And I will give you an e-fought of barley today, and I will accept your word that you'll pay me back tonight.
[time=2289] It was a daily loan.
[time=2292] And it was an expectation that I was going to pay him back when I borrowed not in five years, but tonight.
[time=2299] It was just to get me through the day.
[time=2302] But Steve knows me pretty well.
[time=2305] You may say, "That is high risk." And you may say, "You, an e-fought of barley, I will loan.
[time=2315] But leave your coat here and pick it up tonight when you bring back my e-fought of barley."
[time=2321] I don't know what he's going to do with a size 40 coat, but I give him my coat.
[time=2326] Now, when I come back at night, I say, "Steve, here's your e-fought of barley." And Steve says, "And here's your coat." Borrow from your brother-in-law next time.
[time=2336] Now, what happens if I come back to Steve, and I say, "Steve, I'm cold." And Steve says, "I'm hungry. Where's my barley?" And I say, "Steve, my camel ran out of water, and I didn't make it to the fields, and I go through my song and dance, and he's upset. What's he to do?" He's still supposed to return my coat.
[time=2356] Why?
[time=2357] Well, if he was helping me out because I was so poor and destitute, I couldn't feed myself, and he at least gave me food to make it through the day.
[time=2366] And at the end of the day, he makes me freeze the death. What a friend.
[time=2371] You see the logic of that?
[time=2374] Now, what we have to do is we have to be very careful.
[time=2379] Because now what the responsibility is, according to Leviticus 25, I owe him an e-fought of barley. Now, I am no longer free.
[time=2388] I'm not a slave because I'm an Israelite. If I was an alien, I'd be his slave for that death.
[time=2392] But I am now his indentured servant, and I must work for him until I pay off that e-fought of barley.
[time=2400] Now, be careful how you translate this. This is distinct from our economy today in two ways.
[time=2406] First of all, this was simply a provision for loaning to the poor.
[time=2410] This was not a provision to buy VCRs.
[time=2415] This was not a provision to move up a model here or two in our wheels.
[time=2420] This was not a provision to enter into a joint business relationship.
[time=2424] This was to make it through the day. That day. That's why Jesus said,
[time=2431] "Don't worry about tomorrow. Make it through today." Secondly, it was different in this.
[time=2439] These were not long-term loans. These were daily loans.
[time=2447] Okay. That's the Old Testament. What about the New Testament?
[time=2451] It seems to those of us who have studied the Scriptures, and I have read many fine scholars,
[time=2457] that Jesus recognized and accepted the normal practices of banking, borrowing, and lending at reasonable rates.
[time=2467] Jesus gave two parables, one in Matthew 25, the other in Luke 19, one a parable of talents, the other called the parable of the pounds. Each of them have these things in common.
[time=2477] First of all, the wealthy man dispenses to three different individuals a distinct amount of money to be invested.
[time=2488] Second thing that's in common in both parables, two of the men go out and invest the money and make a profit.
[time=2495] And those two men are praised for being wise businessmen.
[time=2501] Another thing in common between the two parables is the third man goes out, fails to invest the money,
[time=2507] and is severely punished and removed because the man said, "You know I expected to make a return on my money, and you should have done so."
[time=2517] Jesus is there teaching, the value of work, the value of investing, and the right to make a return on an investment.
[time=2526] Well, that's kind of an overview of ancient advice to give us a backdrop of what we're about to study.
[time=2534] Now in the book of Proverbs, it gives some very simple, practical, accurate advice.
[time=2541] First of all, the advice to the potential lender, Proverbs 19, please.
[time=2550] Proverbs 19 and verse 17.
[time=2555] It says this, "He who is kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will reward him for what he's done."
[time=2565] You know what I think the first principle, if you're a potential lender is, it's this one.
[time=2569] It is better to give than to lend.
[time=2574] Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5 verse 42, "Do not turn away him who asks of you your coat, but also give him your sweatshirt."
[time=2587] He didn't say loan it to him, he didn't say rent it to him, he didn't say charge him interest.
[time=2592] He said, "Just give it to him." It's better to give than to lend if it's within your power to do it, and it's your freedom to do it.
[time=2601] You're under no obligation to loan anybody any money, you're under no obligation to give anybody any money in these situations.
[time=2610] But it would be better to give than to lend.
[time=2616] So just give it to that person and recognize you're lending it to the Lord, and he'll pay you back in his own way in his own time.
[time=2623] There's an old German proverb that says this, "Before you borrow money from a friend, you ought to decide which you need the most."
[time=2636] You see, here's what often happens.
[time=2639] Somebody has a friend, but they have no money.
[time=2644] So they go to their friend, they request to borrow the money.
[time=2648] Then they don't pay the money back, and they spend the money, now they have no money, and they have no friend.
[time=2657] One of the most difficult situations ever to deal with is the person who owes you money, and it is long overdue.
[time=2669] Kathy and I had a particular plan of saving that included a number of things, and we had some little place that we rented, and somebody owed us to us a considerable amount of money, and they're gone.
[time=2685] It's been a year or two, we've not seen them or their money, or our money. Then you bump into that person at Pizza Hut.
[time=2697] You don't need to say a thing. There's tension in the room, and then when they see you, you have never seen people eat pizza so fast in your life.
[time=2710] They want out of there now. I wasn't going to say a word to them, but you thought I was going to come over and say, "Well, it's not the money you owe me, but this pizza will make a nice down payment."
[time=2719] Here you go, kids.
[time=2724] Just instantly, you will start avoiding that friend that you owe money. You will not want to see them. If you borrow money from a friend and they're part of your family, you will hate Christmas, Thanksgiving, family reunions, and everything that brings you together, because when you see them, your guilt overcomes you.
[time=2748] It'd be better to give than to lend. The second principle is this. If you choose to lend, it is reasonable for you to ask for security. Proverbs 27, verse 13.
[time=2764] Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger. That's simply saying that most loans need to be collateralized.
[time=2775] Don't loan money without having some type of security to cover that loan.
[time=2785] It's reasonable. Someone should not expect of you that you are going to give your money to them, and you are simply going to trust their smile.
[time=2799] There ought to be something at which you can hold as collateral, something at which you can put a lien in control against. Not saying you have to, you don't even have to loan it, but if you do loan, it is reasonable to ask for security.
[time=2813] Third principle is this. If you choose to lend, and we're not talking about lending to the poor, just somebody who has disposable income or property that they could liquefy and meet their own need, but you choose to loan to them, you may charge an interest, but not exorbitant.
[time=2834] Proverbs 28, 8. He who increases his wealth by exorbitant interest amasses it for another who will be kind to the poor.
[time=2846] I believe that Robin Hood had a good plan, but he should have let God implement it.
[time=2854] Robin Hood's motto was, "Rob from the rich who were taxing the poor unmercifully." So Robin Hood said, "Well, just lighten the king's purse and redistribute it to the poor."
[time=2865] That's perfectly fine, but it wasn't Robin Hood's job to do it was God's job to do it. God says if somebody is making their money at the expense of the poor, God says, "I will equalize the scales in time."
[time=2879] But if you're a potential lender, is it fair for you to charge interest? Yes. In an inflationary economy, it is fair, but reasonably.
[time=2890] Proverbs 13, 11 says, "He who accumulates little by little in the long run saves a lot." Don't try to get rich quick and particularly at somebody else's expense.
[time=2904] Well, what about the advice to the potential borrower? These four things are really important.
[time=2913] One, do not borrow as a substitute for contentment. Never, never leave principal. Number one, Hebrews 13, 5, be content with such things as you have.
[time=2933] You know, no matter how much you have, if you're not content with it, it's not enough. And no matter how little you have, if you're not content with it, it is not enough.
[time=2943] And borrowing because we lack contentment is the deepest form of slavery you will ever know. We have friends within the body of Christ that we have counseled whose income is rather meager.
[time=2960] Their income may be in the range of ten, fifteen, or twenty thousand dollars, and for their family that is not excessive. And they have acquired some debts when they were not content and their debts have accumulated into the hundreds of dollars. That's concerning.
[time=2978] Others have been counseled whose income was two or three times that their income was thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollars, and they were not content with that, and they have borrowed out of lack of contentment, and their debts are accumulating, but not in the hundreds, in the thousands.
[time=3002] And there are others a part of the body who are needing financial counsel because their income is not twenty, fifty thousand dollars. It is one hundred thousand dollars and more, and they have not been content, and they have purchased and borrowed, and their debts are not in the hundreds, or the thousands. Their debts are in the tens of thousands.
[time=3028] It is a paradox, the more we earn, the more we want. The more we want, the more we spend, the more we spend, the more we borrow. And it's at every economic level.
[time=3046] The debts just get bigger as the dollars get higher on the income side.
[time=3052] The second principle is do not borrow as a substitute for saving. We've read Proverbs 6, 7, and 8 several the last week. It says, look to the aunt, you slugger, who has neither a master or an overseer, yet stores up grain.
[time=3067] It saves, it plans. If you save money for your purchase and buy it, it will cost you less than when you borrow it, and it sets on the credit card, and the magic of compounding takes over.
[time=3087] But you see the whole scheme of the financial world is to constantly say, you can borrow, you can have it now, don't wait, want to go on vacation, need a new car, how about a boat, how about graduation, something special for the kids, bigger house room edition, on and on it goes.
[time=3100] And they tell you, master card and you can do it, look out world, here we come. You call it master card today, you'll call it master curse tomorrow. You really will.
[time=3113] Principle number three, be slow to borrow, be slow to borrow. Proverbs 22 verse 7 says, the borrower is servant to the lender. In that economy, that was true.
[time=3134] If you're an alien, let me say I'm an Israelite, and you're a Philistine, and you borrow from me, and you don't pay me back, you're now my slave till you earn that off. I mean, this was literal stuff, but you know it's true today.
[time=3148] Remember the old song, you shovel 16 tons of dirty old coal, and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. St. Peter, don't you call me, because I can't go? I owe my soul to the company store.
[time=3166] That's life. Most of us owe on a house, maybe on a car, but many of us owe on everything we have.
[time=3184] Be slow. You will become servant to that, and they will possess you. Your creditor will possess you to the point where they will come in and say this is no longer your house, and we will take it back, and we will sell it for whatever money we can get for it, and we will take the money out of it, and we will give you what little is left if any.
[time=3209] You are their servant. They will come in, and they will seize not only your house, but they can seize your other property until that is liquefied. Be slow to borrow. That's principle number three. Be slow to borrow.
[time=3224] Here's principle number four. Be even slower to co-sign. If you're going to be slow to borrow for yourself, even be slower to borrow for somebody else. If they need a co-signer, that's this. The creditor is saying they're a bad risk.
[time=3246] Here's chapter six. My son, if you've co-signed, put up security for your neighbor. If you've shook your hand on the deal as a pledge, if you've been trapped by what you said, and sneered by the words of your own mouth, then do this to free yourself.
[time=3267] If you've fallen into your neighbor's hands, go humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor. Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids. Free yourself like a gazelle, or the hand of the hunter, a bird from the snare of the Fowler.
[time=3281] You have made a mistake. You know, people put you on the spot and you say yes before you think through it. Here's a guy who says, "Yeah, I'll co-sign for you."
[time=3291] It's five steps. One, accept responsibility. Recognize. You said yes. Don't blame it on them. Number two, admit your ear. I was wrong. I shouldn't have offered to co-sign with you.
[time=3303] Number three, ask to be released. You may or may not be able to, but at least ask to be released.
[time=3310] Number four, adopt the spirit of humility. Humble yourself. Get out of that. Principal number five. Allow no time and delay.
[time=3320] Do it now. Don't wait 30 days. It'll be that much harder to get out of it. Be slowed to borrow. Be even slower to co-sign.
[time=3329] I want to boil this down to some really quick applications. Now, what I've done so far, that's interpretation.
[time=3335] I believe everything I just said is absolutely biblical, and if you follow it, you're doing the right thing, and if I follow it, I'm doing the right thing.
[time=3342] If you or I don't follow it, we're doing the wrong thing. That's interpretation. This is application. What's the difference?
[time=3348] This is what I think we probably ought to do in light of what we now have studied. Can't say this is absolute, but I think it's good horse sense.
[time=3356] One, use credit cards only in an emergency. Don't use them to purchase things that you can't save to pay for today.
[time=3369] Number two, never carry a balance on a credit card. Most credit cards are anywhere from 18 to 21% interest. At 21% interest over five years, the purchase price doubles.
[time=3388] Isn't that staggering?
[time=3395] Number three, application number three. Never borrow on an item where the debt will outlive the usable life.
[time=3403] In 1860, New York City took out bonds to put a wood street through the Bronx. Ten years later, the wood rotted away, and today they still owe money on that 1860 street that has been gone for 100 years, and they will all on that street
[time=3421] on bonds until the year 2,143.
[time=3428] And some of you are driving an old clunker down one of those streets, and you owe more on it than it's worth, and you're in trouble.
[time=3437] Principle number four, never borrow from a friend. Principal number five, never trade the joy of financial freedom for the bondage of debt.
[time=3463] We've been sharing with you the resurrection power of our Lord Jesus Christ through praise music, music from our sanctuary choir and special guest Keith and star Brodygum, and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3476] As we close today, if you've made a decision for the Lord Jesus Christ, before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you. Will you pray this prayer with me?
[time=3485] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3492] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come in and to cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3498] I ask you to do that to your Lord right now. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3505] If you prayed this prayer with me, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3510] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
