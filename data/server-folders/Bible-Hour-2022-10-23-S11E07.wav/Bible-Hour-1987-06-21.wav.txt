[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship
[time=78] on the Bible Hour.
[time=79] Thank you for joining us.
[time=81] Our special guest speaker is Dr. Don Gehrig, the president of Fort Wayne Bible College.
[time=87] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=90] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=93] Other special music includes a solo from Kevin Rowe and Lynn Rowell.
[time=101] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne,
[time=108] Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=112] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=115] - Welcome to us to our service today, the Bible Hour and those that are viewing.
[time=121] We're glad that you're joining with us.
[time=123] From time to time, it seems like it's always when I'm in grubbies, we go to a fast food place or whatever like we did yesterday and get in there and we're just going to get a quick hamburger and sneak out of there when nobody will see us.
[time=135] Somebody comes up and says, "We watch the Bible Hour faithfully every week," and that happened last night, and it was just great, however, to know that there are people around the Fort Wayne area.
[time=145] Many of whom are unable to come and worship in a church like we are today, but have the opportunity to join with us in our service.
[time=152] That is a great privilege for us to be allowed to be in their homes and in their hospital rooms and in jails, wherever the TV is on, and I hope that this will be a special day for everyone as we worship together.
[time=164] The choir is going to sing a number now.
[time=167] It's entitled, "Closer Than a Heart Beat," and we think about the needs and the problems that we have in our lives and we come to the time when we say to the Lord, "Lord, I just
[time=177] don't have the strength to continue." We know that through the Holy Spirit that God is right there in our lives, we can call on Him, and when our failures are great, greater than all the problems we can comprehend, we
[time=191] know that Christ is right there and will help us.
[time=194] Ryan Lowson is going to sing the solo part as the choir sings, "Closer Than a Heart Beat."
[time=213] You look for signs, you search the skies above, yet I say again, "My kingdom is within, whereby
[time=232] my spirit, I will reign in love, closer than a heartbeat, I will be to you, closer than
[time=249] a heartbeat, in everything you do, dear than a heartbeat, when you sleep I will never,
[time=265] never to forsake my own.
[time=268] I will be closer than a heartbeat, closer than a heartbeat, for your heart will be my home.
[time=279] Or like a tree that's sewn into the pallow ground becomes that tree with branches wide
[time=296] and strong, I will sow in you a love that grows and blooms and fills your sight with
[time=309] your silent spirit with my song, "Closer Than a Heart Beat, I will be to you, closer than
[time=325] a heartbeat, in everything you do, dear than the breath you say, when you sleep I will
[time=337] never, never to forsake my own.
[time=344] I will be closer than a heartbeat, closer than a heartbeat, for your heart will be my home.
[time=383] Thank you, Brian, and choir, for sharing your abilities and music and reminding us of
[time=404] how close our Lord is.
[time=407] We mention greeting people and from time to time letters do come in to the office telling
[time=414] about viewers and there is one lady in particular, her name is Mrs. Anders, she will be turning 93 this week, she watches the Bible hour faithfully and her daughter asks if we would
[time=425] sing amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[time=429] We don't often talk about requests and honor them because it's difficult, but when you turn 93 and you have a request for a particular song you just let me know and we'll be sure and sing it for you.
[time=441] We're singing together, hymn number 187, amazing grace, how sweet the sound, we'll sing the
[time=447] first three stanzas with the organ and piano and then we'll skip to the sixth stanza and
[time=454] sing that acapella, hymn number 187.
[time=473] Sing a prayer for me, I once was lost, but now and now was I the power I see.
[time=496] Oh, the grace that taught my heart to you, when grace I feel free, how precious it
[time=516] is, how precious it is, how precious it is, how precious it is, how precious it is,
[time=577] Thank you for that good singing and the third verse that talked about the grace that keeps
[time=602] us here while we're living on this earth and just the beginning of that as we taste a little bit of heaven here and then look forward to the eternal life that we'll have and the ability to have a song in our hearts throughout our entire life and for eternity because of our
[time=618] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=620] Kevin Rowe comes to sing a song now that's on that same theme.
[time=624] Let's listen carefully as he ministers to us.
[time=647] Listen to the words I have to say, I don't need this life to try and help me find a better
[time=663] way.
[time=664] I've found the gold that I've been looking for, I've found the key that opens every door,
[time=673] I've found the one who takes the credit for this music we enjoy, don't you know the sun
[time=685] will shine, in the promised land can't wait for love to go, in the promised land and don't
[time=693] you know you can go to the promised land can't wait for love to show you to the promised
[time=706] land.
[time=709] Now you've come this far, you don't need this love anymore, take a walk with Christ,
[time=723] He will lead you through all stripes, I've found the gold that I've been looking for,
[time=731] I've found the key that opens every door, I've found the one who takes the credit for
[time=740] this music we enjoy, don't you know the sun will shine, in the promised land you could
[time=751] be singing all the time, and don't you know that you can go to the promised land can't
[time=760] wait for love to show you to the promised land.
[time=772] In days of old God promised him Moses and his people that they would have a promised land and that promise is still true for us today, if we accept Christ and receive the gift that he asked for us, that gift ultimately results in heaven, the promised land for us is a major stay, I pray that you've received that too.
[time=789] I've found the one that takes the credit for, I've found the key that opens every door,
[time=798] I've found the one who takes the credit for this music we enjoy, don't you know the sun
[time=810] will shine, in the promised land you could be singing all the time, and don't you know
[time=818] that you can go to the promised land can't wait for love to show you, don't you know
[time=827] the sun will shine, in the promised land you could be singing all the time, and don't you
[time=836] know that you can go to the promised land can't wait for love to show you, don't you know
[time=846] that you can go to the promised land can't wait for love to show you to the promised
[time=854] land.
[time=857] Hello and thank you for the privilege of sharing the ministries of Black Hawk Baptist
[time=865] Church by way of television, it's really an honor for us to come into your home or hospital room or wherever you may be today.
[time=873] Today my wife and I are here in Fort Wayne recording this, but actually the time you'll see it will be enjoying a family vacation in Florida, and we have as our special guest today Dr. Don Gary who's the president of Fort Wayne Bible College, and he'll be challenging
[time=889] you with God's Word in just a few moments, I know that's a privilege that you can be looking forward to, also you can be looking forward to the patriotic panorama coming up very soon.
[time=899] Rick, it's just a week away and we're really excited about having the special guest Carla Whirly with us, Carla's an outstanding soprano soloist, she's sung with such people as Larnal
[time=909] Harris, the Bill Gather Trio, and even Bill and Gloria Gather, and she has a wonderful, wonderful testimony and a beautiful voice, it's going to be an exciting time, that's next Sunday, June 28th we have two performances at 5pm and 8pm, and there are just a few tickets
[time=925] left and you should contact the Blackhawk Baptist Church, I'll just give you the telephone number because if you write it will be too late, the telephone number is 7498524 or just
[time=936] stop in, you can get free tickets, but you need a ticket to enter the concert, once again
[time=942] it's next Sunday, June 28th at 5pm and 8pm, the sanctuary choir, along with special guest
[time=948] Carla Whirly will be singing for us.
[time=950] Well, we're looking forward to being back in time for the panorama, being a part of it and enjoying it with everyone else, right?
[time=957] A few Sundays ago we began announcing a very important announcement to you and we want to repeat that again today so that we don't lose any of you, our friends, during a timeshift
[time=967] of the Bible hour, for 14 years we've been live broadcasting at 11 o'clock on Sunday
[time=973] mornings, WPTA, our host station here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, is changing all of their
[time=979] Sunday morning programming and from 8 till noon will no longer be religious broadcasting.
[time=985] They have, however, made from 7 to 8 o'clock available to us.
[time=989] So beginning two Sundays from now, July the 5th here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Bible hour will be on from 7 to 8 in the morning, so please make note of that and stay with
[time=1000] us as we go through that timeshift.
[time=1002] We want to thank the many of you who have written to WPTA, expressing your disappointment that we're no longer live and that we're no longer on at 11 o'clock and we appreciate that support and I know they appreciate your gracious letters letting them know your feelings.
[time=1017] Today for one final time, we would like to offer you a helpful booklet by Phil Yancy entitled Money.
[time=1024] This booklet is not a how to get rich quick scheme.
[time=1028] It's not a book saying here's how you can manipulate God to do what you want.
[time=1032] We cannot manipulate God.
[time=1035] Actually what it is is a good honest look at finances and the power they have in our lives
[time=1041] and the power we have if we have finances and how God would want us to carefully guard it.
[time=1047] Jesus' words were these, you cannot serve God and money.
[time=1052] Money has a power that has a rival God in our generation and keeping that in check is
[time=1059] important.
[time=1060] We'd love to send you a copy of this book if you would simply write to us today as a free gift from us to you.
[time=1065] You don't have to send us money to get the book money.
[time=1070] I hope that you'll write for the booklet entitled Money Today.
[time=1073] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and
[time=1079] the zip code is 46815.
[time=1082] Once again the address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code
[time=1089] is 46815.
[time=1092] Well I'm looking forward to vacation but I'm already looking forward to coming back from vacation to be a part of the panorama and the Bible Hour and our morning worship services and please do make every effort to join us by way of television and then in person for the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1112] [MUSIC - 161 seconds]
[time=1285] Thank you Lynn there is no limit to our God he's limitless. Pastor Hawks and
[time=1297] Kathy and the family are vacationing now will return next Sunday. It's my privilege to be able
[time=1303] to introduce to you Dr. Donald Gurig. He brings significant leadership to the presidency of the
[time=1310] Fort Wayne Bible College. He assumed that responsibility in August the 1st 1986. He brings 25 years of
[time=1319] pastoral experience and I'm sure God has laid something on his heart that would speak to us today.
[time=1327] So without any further come and speak to us brother, Lord bless you.
[time=1333] Thank you Pastor Lampman it is just a delight to be here at Blackhawk with you today.
[time=1340] I've had a new experience this year being more of an itinerant speaker after 25 years of being in
[time=1348] the same pulpit Sunday after Sunday. Now it's kind of interesting to be in a different pulpit almost every Sunday but it's been exciting because what I have discovered is this wonderful family of God that scattered all over the country bound together because of a common
[time=1364] commitment to Jesus Christ and I've just made more new friends in the past nine or ten months
[time=1370] that I knew was possible and it's been a thrill and it's also been a source of a lot of interesting experiences already. I imagine until I'm done there'll be more of those but I remember not
[time=1381] too long ago speaking in a small country church where just before I was speaking also a young lady
[time=1387] was singing as happened here only while she was singing a bat started flying in the church.
[time=1395] How she kept her concentration as well as she did I'm not quite sure but after that I had one
[time=1402] of the most unusual introductions I've ever had as the fellow who introduced me literally got up
[time=1408] and went something like this. Now we're happy to have Dr. Gary with us tonight from the Bible
[time=1415] College and I'm sure glad I don't have to preach and then he turned it over to me. Well
[time=1423] as happened however the bat went over as soon as I got up this actually happened the bat went over
[time=1431] stuck himself on a window in the church and went to sleep. I was reminded that I had been doing
[time=1442] that for 25 years so I should have changed. Well but we are delighted to be here we're almost
[time=1450] well we are neighbors not almost live near here and in fact I jogged through your parking lot earlier this morning when I was getting going. Pastor Rick in his letter to me I've been I was
[time=1461] trying to think how I could take him up on this but it just I haven't come up with a good way
[time=1467] in his letter he said if it's necessary for you to fly from the noles we'll pay your airfare.
[time=1474] I thought who do I know that has a helicopter or something you know I could just skip over for three or four blocks and put him to the test. Well anyway I want to do something this morning that is
[time=1485] somewhat dangerous and I say that because what I want to do is take you to a very familiar passage
[time=1492] of scripture and the danger of that is that anytime you go to a familiar passage of scripture
[time=1499] the tendency is to be greeted with a yawn. Well we've heard this before and we tend to cut ourselves
[time=1508] off from what might be something fresh that God would like to say to us out of a passage like this.
[time=1516] So I point you to the 12th chapter of Romans if I may and the first two verses of that
[time=1522] great great chapter. It's a chapter I've fallen in love with over recent months the whole chapter is
[time=1530] just full of some of the most practical teaching about how we live as Christians that I think
[time=1537] you'll find anywhere in scripture. There's always a certain tension between theology and the truth of
[time=1545] our salvation and the practical lifestyle side of our Christian faith and Romans 12 I think does a
[time=1555] wonderful piece of bringing together those two extremes if you will and helping us understand
[time=1562] how what Christ has done for us is supposed to look then as it happens in our lives.
[time=1569] What we do as Christians doesn't relate to getting salvation but it's a response to salvation
[time=1578] and there's such a significant difference there because of what Christ has done for us we respond then in a life that pleases him. So these first two verses come to us very
[time=1591] in a very familiar sound I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present
[time=1598] your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is your reasonable service
[time=1605] and do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[time=1612] that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
[time=1619] There's a commitment assumed in those first two verses and I want to talk about that this morning
[time=1625] if I may I'd like to ask two very simple questions what is this commitment what are we talking about
[time=1633] when we talk about presenting ourselves to God and then why is it so important now that's about
[time=1639] as basic as you can get so we'll take those two and try to answer them and get your minds and hearts
[time=1645] working along with God this morning what kind of commitment are we talking about here I'm
[time=1651] intrigued really with the way Paul starts I don't know how I would have written this passage
[time=1660] if the assignment had been mine I suspect that coming off of the first eleven chapters of Romans
[time=1669] I would have found something what shall I say a bit more of a euphemism in religious terms present
[time=1678] your whole being to God present your soul to God I'm not sure I would have said present your bodies
[time=1689] to God that is so everyday-ish and yet the more I have thought about that the more I have tried
[time=1700] to understand why Paul uses bodies when he's talking about commitment to God the more I think
[time=1710] I've begun to understand what he's trying to say so much of our living is very routine really when
[time=1722] you stop to think about it there isn't much time in the course of your life that can be called special
[time=1731] or spectacular we go along we may have you know a great vacation or a great family night or a
[time=1741] great time in church or just a wonderful time alone with God somewhere but measure the time that
[time=1749] those take and what you come up with is the fact that really the overwhelming majority of our lives
[time=1758] are spent in ordinary day by day kind of living if we end up restricting God to just those special
[time=1771] times if the only time we really think about God is those those great special moments what we have
[time=1780] done is leave him out of the majority of our lives isn't that right and if God can't penetrate
[time=1792] the everyday part of my life where I live day by day by day by day if he can't penetrate that
[time=1799] then he really hasn't penetrated me so Paul says present your bodies as living sacrifices
[time=1810] and in doing that he really ties into where we live at a day by day basis he also I think ties
[time=1819] into the reality of where spiritual battles are won or lost
[time=1825] you see I am not going to succeed or fail as a Christian based just on the special moments
[time=1832] in my life I'm going to succeed or fail on my ability to live daily with him
[time=1840] one Sunday up in Chicago I was walking to the church I sometimes did that on nice days we lived
[time=1851] 10 11 blocks or so from our church and so I would walk on a nice morning just to kind of be alone and get ready for the day I was walking by our local YMCA when out of the Y came an older
[time=1864] gentleman who I recognized as having attended some of our Sunday evening services so we kind of
[time=1872] fell in line together and began to walk I was curious what this elderly gentleman was doing
[time=1878] walking well it was somewhere between seven and seven thirty in the morning I guess when I was heading over had a briefcase in his hand in chatting with him I discovered he was in his upper 80s
[time=1889] and I asked him where he was going turned out he was going to church he attended a free Methodist church that was in another neighboring suburb about five and a half
[time=1904] miles walking distance so he had to leave early in order to get to church on time
[time=1910] and the reason he came to our church sometimes in the evening was that he couldn't always
[time=1916] walk twice on a Sunday in his upper 80s now I would suggest to you that that man's spiritual
[time=1926] life related a great deal to his willingness to submit his body to the Lord you see
[time=1933] there's some of you who may be failing in your daily quiet time with God not because of a lack
[time=1940] of spiritual nerve or desire but because you don't get to bed early enough the night before
[time=1946] the victory is lost at a very mundane level because you stay up too late you watch the
[time=1957] tube too long and the next morning when you know you ought to get up and spend time with the Lord you go oh 30 more minutes and you roll over our bodies young people today are coming to us at the bible college for instance
[time=1975] out of just an incredible background of experiences in their lives and they relate to the fact that
[time=1981] they have lived in a day and age when the discipline of their bodies has not been taken seriously
[time=1990] now you can have all of the glorious services you want to talk about but until God has control of my body my everyday day by day kind of life he really doesn't have me
[time=2006] Ray Orland who speaks on the haven of rest program some years ago put out a little book
[time=2012] called Lord make my life a miracle and he has an interesting little quote at the end of the book
[time=2019] that I think says what I'm trying to say this morning he says it this way the 20th century temptations that really sapped our spiritual power our television banana cream pie the easy
[time=2033] chair and the credit card the Christian wins or loses in those seemingly innocent little moments
[time=2042] of decision I think he is right on you may make a decision Tuesday afternoon that will have more
[time=2054] to do with the direction of your spiritual life in the long run than you do today we must start to bring together God's influence in our life into that daily day by day experience
[time=2071] and I think that is precisely why Paul very wisely said I beseech you to present your bodies
[time=2079] as sacrifices to God now when we talk about this commitment and what is involved in it
[time=2089] we really have only talked about half of the issue at this point however because verse two goes on to give us the flip side if you will the other side of the coin
[time=2100] and don't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[time=2108] and I was submit to you this morning that this is what makes this truth fit together if indeed I have to try to discipline my body just out of sheer willpower
[time=2123] I suspect I'm going to lose and so Paul wisely says that the part of this equation that will make
[time=2133] your commitment to God possible is the degree to which you allow your mind to be renewed by him
[time=2141] that you feed your mind with the things of God and that will power your commitment of body to God
[time=2154] that's extremely wise talk friends earlier in the same book he reminded us of the fact
[time=2160] that if we are going to walk by the flesh we will set our minds on the things of the flesh
[time=2166] conversely if we will walk by the spirit we will set our minds on the things of the spirit
[time=2172] Solomon in the book of Proverbs made the great statement as a man thinketh in his heart
[time=2181] so is he so you see your own nightingale was not the one who discovered this truth
[time=2187] he says you become what you think about most of the time and he is right he just isn't original
[time=2197] he got that right out of scripture and this is going to be where we end up winning or losing
[time=2206] the battle it's interesting that if we were to be able to take these two verses apart a little more
[time=2212] and look at the tenses that are used here we would find an intriguing scenario because in the first
[time=2219] verse Paul says in effect I beseech you that once and for all you get this issue of your bodies settled
[time=2227] present them once and for all to God make that a determination that this is how you're going to
[time=2234] live your life that's it then when he gets to verse two he changes tenses and here he says
[time=2242] I want you to keep on on an ongoing basis allowing your minds to be renewed always be in the process
[time=2252] of being transformed by the renewing of your mind and what he simply suggests is that the power
[time=2261] of commitment of our lives to God must be fueled daily by how we feed our minds
[time=2269] what scares me on this is not so much that we're going to lose the battle by intentionally feeding
[time=2281] our minds with that which is evil but rather we're going to lose the battle because we have not
[time=2288] intentionally fed our minds with that which is good we have tried to play neutral and you can't do that see I would ask you this morning to think for just a moment in your own lives
[time=2303] how much time did you spend last week feeding your mind with the things of God on purpose
[time=2313] what did you read what did you listen to what did you watch what did you think about
[time=2321] what was your conversation with other Christian friends how much did you do purposely
[time=2331] to feed your mind with things of God it's very easy to get caught up in a day by day kind of life
[time=2340] and just miss it by default you get up in the morning flip on the today show watch the news
[time=2350] jump in the car off to work go through the day of work back in the car back home
[time=2358] mow the yarn grab a bite eat watch wheel of fortune sit in the chair and go to sleep
[time=2367] that's what I do I mean sit in the chair and go to sleep that part wake up in time to go get ready for bed watch Andy Carson's monologue go to bed wake up the next morning flip on good morning America this time in the car off to work back home eat watch TV go to
[time=2383] bed you see what I'm saying you haven't really done anything bad you haven't gone out and bought
[time=2393] dirty magazines or watch dirty movies or anything like that you haven't done anything bad but you haven't done anything good you just been in neutral parked in in neutral
[time=2406] and nowhere in that cycle of day by day living was there a point where you purposely
[time=2416] intentionally took time to read to think to listen to converse on the things of God
[time=2425] and I'm telling you today my friends listen to this if you don't fuel your walk with God
[time=2436] with daily on purpose contact with him you will fail in the commitment of your life to him
[time=2446] the one feeds the other and Paul isn't just making an accidental connection of thoughts here
[time=2455] in these first two verses of Romans when he says I beseech you that you present your bodies as living
[time=2462] sacrifice and that you allow your minds to be renewed he puts them together because it makes
[time=2469] sense that's the way life works
[time=2480] so it's a commitment that's two-sided when you identify it don't ever look at Romans 12 one by itself
[time=2490] the commitment you're being asked to make is a commitment of your bodies to God and your minds
[time=2498] to renewal from contact with him well if that is the what then maybe we need to also talk about
[time=2507] the why why do we make this kind of commitment of ourselves to him and here again the scripture
[time=2514] gives us the answer right in the very first part of the first verse we have a great word that we
[time=2521] need to look at you've probably heard this old cliche but it needs to be repeated today
[time=2527] anytime when you're reading the scripture that you see the word therefore you need to find out
[time=2534] what it's there for so that's the key word right at the opening of verse one I beseech you
[time=2542] therefore by the mercies of God and when he uses that word Paul simply points us back to everything
[time=2552] he's been saying in the first eleven chapters of this great book this is undoubtedly the greatest
[time=2560] exposition of the work of Christ that you'll find anywhere in scripture
[time=2567] he takes three chapters to set us up with our need and boy let me tell you by the time you get
[time=2573] done reading the first three chapters of Romans you understand that nobody is exempt we all are
[time=2580] sinners in need of a savior then he begins to expound for us the wonderful work of Christ and
[time=2588] how by faith we accept that and with it comes the power of the Holy Spirit in us because he is
[time=2594] the one who brings us into God's family and and he goes on to just outline and expand the wonderful
[time=2601] work that Christ has done for us and I love the way he concludes the 11th chapter it's a it's a
[time=2608] perfect wrap-up to everything he has said for of him that's speaking of Christ for of him and
[time=2617] through him and to him are all things in other words for of him he is the one who created all
[time=2625] through him he is the one who makes it all work and to him back to him goes all the glory for of
[time=2631] him through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever I beseech you therefore
[time=2641] and what he is simply saying to us is you cannot possibly look at the grace of God
[time=2648] and then be neutral in how you live I never want to hear from anyone the idea that if we preach the
[time=2658] grace of God we give people the liberty to live the way they want to not true if you understand the
[time=2666] grace of God my friend you can do nothing more than to respond with a life that reflects itself
[time=2673] back to God when you see what he's done for you how he has taken you in in a way you couldn't do
[time=2682] yourself and given you life when you understand that you have to talk about how to commit yourself back to him not to earn his attention but to respond to it I love Galatians 220 where he talks about
[time=2697] being crucified with Christ it's no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me and I love to visualize
[time=2703] that God looks down here on earth and when he sees Don Gary I'm thankful he doesn't really see
[time=2712] Don Gary anymore he sees Jesus Christ living in Don Gary and so he gets his my you know in my
[time=2720] wild imagination he gets his book out and says what sort of a fellow is Don Gary
[time=2726] he looks down and he sees Jesus Christ living in me and that's my hope for when he sees Jesus Christ living in me he says that guy's okay not because of what I did
[time=2740] but because of who lives in me now when I understand that I can walk into the presence of God based
[time=2746] on what Jesus Christ has done for me I can't be casual about how I live
[time=2752] so why do I make this commitment of myself to him well because of what he's done for me it's
[time=2762] as simple as that I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God to present yourselves as living
[time=2769] sacrifices boy that makes all the sense in the world when you look at it that way
[time=2775] but there's another reason for in the first part of the second verse he alludes to the fact that we
[time=2784] could fall into the problem of being conformed to this world fitting into the mold of this world
[time=2792] and so my commitment to him my commitment of body and the renewing of my mind is my way of
[time=2801] aggressively resisting the impact of the world on me I'm supposed to be a part of a different
[time=2809] kingdom my ideals my ethics my integrity my righteousness is to be dictated by the kingdom
[time=2820] of God not by the kingdom of this world and if I am going to live that way if I am going to be
[time=2826] distinct unique special in this world as a follower of Jesus Christ I must be aggressively
[time=2834] following him or else I'll end up being squeezed into this world let us never underestimate the
[time=2844] power of the world to influence us my friends we bump into it every waking moment of our lives
[time=2852] the billboards you will look at as you drive out of here and on your way to somewhere today
[time=2859] the stuff you'll see on tv what you'll listen to on the radio what you'll read in the newspapers I
[time=2865] don't care where it is the advertising which will try to convince you of all the things you need that are only going to pass away anyway every bit of that is the world's way of saying be like us
[time=2877] think like us have your motivations the same of ours let your ethics be like ours be like us
[time=2887] and into that kind of situation God comes along and says be like me
[time=2897] and we won't do it if we aren't aggressively intentionally committing ourselves to him
[time=2906] there simply isn't a middle ground it isn't a case of either commitment be neutral or fall
[time=2914] into the world's mold no there are only two choices and if you aren't aggressively pursuing
[time=2922] your commitment to God you can count on it that you're slowly but surely being squeezed into the
[time=2929] mold of this world as sure as you're sitting here this morning there's a third reason yet why this commitment is important and it comes at the end of the second
[time=2944] verse so you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God
[time=2952] boy listen if you know Christ today that ought to strike a bell
[time=2959] you talk about a life goal that I may prove put to the test live out
[time=2970] that which is good and acceptable and perfect the will of God but I can't do that without the commitment you see that is the way it happens
[time=2984] it's because I present my body as a living sacrifice it is because I am transformed by the
[time=2990] renewing of my mind that I am able to prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God
[time=2996] those fit together it isn't one or the other they all flow out of the same situation
[time=3003] well what an opportunity we have as followers of Jesus Christ
[time=3011] now I make that assumption perhaps I shouldn't
[time=3017] and I can only say this much this morning if you are here and you're fuzzy about that
[time=3024] commitment to Jesus Christ in the first place then that's where you need to start you need to back up and understand the mercies of God and respond with the giving of your life to him
[time=3037] but once having done that please don't see that relationship is little more than a fire escape
[time=3044] but see it as an opportunity to respond to God and become a child that reflects
[time=3054] your heavenly father to others one where the body is presented to him daily
[time=3062] in my everyday living I show forth Christ in the way I'm feeding and renewing my mind I
[time=3070] show forth Christ I let him be seen you know sometimes we get caught talking this talking one thing and living another
[time=3084] I mentioned to the folks on Thursday night when we were here speaking hearing an old preacher in
[time=3091] chapel in college one day not a lot I remember 30 years later from chapel but I do remember this
[time=3097] one his comment was that he believed in holiness but he said I believe in the kind of holiness
[time=3105] where the steam goes through the piston and not through the whistle
[time=3112] boys they're a lot there the kind of holiness where the steam goes through the piston and not
[time=3118] through the whistle that's what Romans 12 1 and 2 are all about it's allowing our lives to respond
[time=3125] in a way that shows up so that if somebody is following me around next week they'll have to look
[time=3133] at my life and say something's different he's marching to a different drummer he must belong to
[time=3140] Christ what are they going to say when they follow you
[time=3147] on this father's day you know I would address men particularly what will your children say when
[time=3156] they observe you you're not fooling them anyway your talk isn't going to amount to a whole lot
[time=3162] they are going to be watching your life and your declarations on Sunday need to be backed up with
[time=3169] what you're doing Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday the rest of the days that is where the battle is fought that is where we will find out whether we really have committed
[time=3181] our bodies as living sacrifices whether our minds are being renewed whether that commitment is a
[time=3187] part of us as it should be I remember when I was in high school I have the privilege really and I
[time=3196] say it that way today to the glory of God I have the privilege of a father who gave me a wonderful
[time=3202] heritage in the Lord not everybody can say that these days and so I understand how privileged I am
[time=3210] that I can dad today is the only remaining parent that Carolyn and I have but Carolyn's folks
[time=3219] before they went to be with the Lord were missionaries in South America my dad was a pastor I'm a dad served their whole lifetime in the ministry all four of the kids in our family are
[time=3230] in the ministry today because we saw it as something positive something real but I still
[time=3238] remember when I was a high schooler and if I remember correctly I think this incident took place soon before just before I was to get my driver's license
[time=3250] dad was going to give me a word of warning I understand that now believe me but we were driving the church one night it was just the two of us and he never had made me feel like I
[time=3262] had to live in the fishbowl you've heard of preachers kids you know who say they grew up in the fishbowl and all that everybody watched them well I never felt like that but this one time here's what he said to me Don I just want you to understand that if you mess up
[time=3278] you don't only affect yourself but you affect me in my ministry too
[time=3285] and I have to tell you there were times in my life when I think that little word of warning
[time=3294] spared me from things I might have been sorry about the rest of my life because even when I disagreed with dad and we had our conflicts like any teenager and father do even at those points there was still underneath a respect for him and I couldn't bring myself
[time=3311] to do something that would reflect back on him and his ministry and affect it
[time=3317] I sort of have a feeling that maybe that's what our heavenly father would like to say to us today too
[time=3330] child please remember that what you do doesn't just affect you but affects me as well
[time=3341] please remember the next Thursday morning when you think life is just an innocuous piece of time
[time=3349] what you're doing is being watched by someone and they're reflecting on me because of what you do
[time=3360] so please please and again I'm I guess in an imaginary way saying what I think God might say
[time=3368] please please I beseech you by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice
[time=3378] holy acceptable to God which is your reasonable service
[time=3385] don't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the ongoing renewing of your mind
[time=3393] that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God
[time=3400] father I would pray this morning that you would open our hearts and our lives to you
[time=3411] please help us to understand that what we do today day by day in our living what we do tomorrow
[time=3419] Tuesday Wednesday does have an effect on others and how they see you help us to understand how
[time=3428] important it is for us to intentionally give ourselves to mind renewal to be in touch with you on a
[time=3436] regular basis may we indeed commit ourselves to you so that your mercies will be seen in us and
[time=3444] through us to others grant that our commitment will be strong even because we have been able to
[time=3452] spend this time together today for that we will praise you as we pray in the name of Christ
