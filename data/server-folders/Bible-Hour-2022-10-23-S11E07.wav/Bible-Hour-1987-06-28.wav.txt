[time=90] (bell chimes) Prosperity with all of its obvious benefits
[time=118] has some inherent dangers.
[time=120] The greatest of which is that prosperity often leads to pride.
[time=126] And we as a nation have prospered so much, we are guilty of the same sins as Israel.
[time=132] Chiefly amongst them, the pride of self-sufficiency, that we've done it ourselves.
[time=138] God wasn't a part of this.
[time=140] We have forgotten God.
[time=143] We need to remember the immortal words of Benjamin Franklin.
[time=147] When he said, "I have lived a long life, sirs, and the longer I live, the more convincing proves I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men." (bell chimes)
[time=175] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=178] Thank you for joining us.
[time=180] Rick's message today is taken from Proverbs, chapter 14, and is entitled "Righteousness Exults a Nation." It was 200 years ago this summer that delegates met in Philadelphia to draft our great Constitution.
[time=195] It was there that Benjamin Franklin spoke these immortal words, "God governs in the affairs of men." Today we have lost that truth as a nation.
[time=204] We have forgotten that God has blessed America.
[time=207] In today's message from Proverbs, we will discover a central biblical principle, righteousness exults a nation, an appropriate topic as we celebrate the Fourth of July.
[time=219] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=223] We will be looking at Proverbs, chapter 14, verse 34.
[time=227] Our special musical guest today is recording artist Carla Whirly.
[time=232] She will be ministering to us along with our sanctuary choir.
[time=237] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=242] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=247] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour and trust that whether you're here or watching by way of television, God will speak to your heart today and fill your heart with gratitude for this great country he's given to us called America.
[time=263] Tonight is our patriotic panorama, a series of concerts dedicated to that purpose, praising God for his goodness.
[time=270] We've prepared as a church, particularly as a choir, and we've also invited a special guest to be with us, Carla Whirly.
[time=278] Carla will be singing here this morning and as a part of the concert tonight, and our choir and Carla are now going to lead us in a great majestic anthem of praise that speaks about the foundation for our lives and for our nation in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=293] Welcome, Carla, to Black Hawk.
[time=295] Thank you, Pete, and choir for all you've done to prepare for this special day.
[time=300] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=480] [APPLAUSE]
[time=488] Hey, man, my faith has found a resting place.
[time=491] I need no argument, but Jesus Christ, him number one, please.
[time=496] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas of this great hymn.
[time=500] Stanzas one, two, and four of hymn number one.
[time=504] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=619] Thank you very much for your good singing today.
[time=622] We appreciate that.
[time=624] We've been preparing for the Patriotic Panorama, and it's been a special privilege to prepare music that we'll sing along with our special guest, Carla Whirly.
[time=633] We welcome Carla and her husband, Dennis, and son with us for the entire day.
[time=637] It's going to be a great evening of music tonight, and this is just a taste of what a marvelous taste as Carla comes again to minister to us through the medium of music.
[time=647] Carla?
[time=649] [MUSIC - 307 seconds]
[time=962] Well, it's a privilege for me to welcome you today
[time=976] to the Bible Hour.
[time=978] We were gone on vacation last week and we absolutely missed this church in the ministry of television.
[time=985] It's good to be home.
[time=986] Well, Rick, we missed you too.
[time=987] We were glad that you had the rest, but we welcome you back and also your family.
[time=991] This is a big day at Black Hawk Baptist Church and we're glad you're here to be a part of it.
[time=995] Oh, it's exciting to come home on any occasion, but particularly to the Patriotic Panorama today and all of the specialness of the morning because of that.
[time=1003] Well, this is our 14th Patriotic Panorama that we'll be having this Sunday evening at five o'clock and eight o'clock.
[time=1009] There are tickets still available at the eight o'clock hour, and if you're out there and would like to enjoy a great evening of Patriotic music, we invite you to the Black Hawk Baptist Church tonight at eight o'clock.
[time=1020] Come and join us for a great time.
[time=1022] Our sanctuary choir will be singing and Carla Whirly is our special guest.
[time=1026] Rick, she's in town.
[time=1027] We talked to her last night and I'm just really excited to have her here this morning as well as this evening.
[time=1033] She'll be singing more in the evening service than she has in this morning's hour.
[time=1037] Well, I'm looking forward to hearing Carla.
[time=1039] You just heard her a few moments ago and she sang the song with the choir and then a solo.
[time=1044] She has a great ministry, but I'm just as excited about the ministry of our choir.
[time=1049] There's something majestic and special about those 100 plus voices singing the praises of our God and thanking him for the blessings that he has poured out across this nation.
[time=1061] It is a good thing to remember our God in the days of prosperity.
[time=1065] It is so easy to say, look what we've done and fail to remember.
[time=1069] It's all a gift from God.
[time=1071] And tonight it's really a Patriotic program.
[time=1073] Yes, but in many ways it is a Thanksgiving service saying, God, we thank you.
[time=1078] We know you have blessed us and we honor you tonight as our God.
[time=1082] And if you're available, we want to encourage you to come at eight o'clock here.
[time=1087] It's June the 28th.
[time=1088] If you're watching in other cities, it's already too late.
[time=1091] But here in Fort Wayne, you could come tonight at eight o'clock.
[time=1094] We'd love to see you here.
[time=1096] Well, we are live today here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1099] But unfortunately, starting next week, we will no longer be live and we will no longer be on at eleven o'clock.
[time=1106] Please take careful note of this.
[time=1108] Beginning next Sunday here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, our time will change from eleven to seven a.m.
[time=1116] We're going to have to set that alarm a little earlier and get up and begin your day like a morning devotion, worshiping the Lord with us.
[time=1124] It'll be a great way to start your day.
[time=1126] And so please take note.
[time=1127] Next week, we'll be on, but it'll be at seven in the morning.
[time=1130] And we want you to join us then.
[time=1132] We'll also be expanding.
[time=1134] Next Sunday, we'll be again broadcasting at eleven o'clock in Lima, Ohio.
[time=1140] For you friends in Ohio, we'll still be on at eleven on a different channel, Channel 44 over in Lima.
[time=1146] For you friends in Marion and in South Bend, we're on the regular channels at the regular times.
[time=1151] But Fort Wayne, please note that we'll be on at seven o'clock next week in the morning.
[time=1156] Pete, thanks for the great music you prepared while I was gone.
[time=1159] I'm looking forward to all of it today.
[time=1161] Well, our people have really been very faithful.
[time=1164] At summertime, it's easy to get away and go to the summer cottage and on vacations.
[time=1169] And our people do take the vacations, but they're good at staying around until the patriotic panorama is over.
[time=1175] And we have a great group of people for which I'm thankful.
[time=1177] I'm looking forward to it.
[time=1179] Over the past few weeks, as I've been speaking here, we've been talking about principles from the book of Proverbs that deal with finances and money.
[time=1187] We've talked about the value of contentment and the importance of working and working hard.
[time=1192] Saving and planning, the dangers of excessive borrowing.
[time=1196] Money.
[time=1197] What does God have to say about it?
[time=1200] Well, we have an excellent booklet to share with you, and it's absolutely free if you'll simply write and ask for it.
[time=1206] Simply ask for the booklet entitled Money by Philip Yancy.
[time=1210] It gives some great insights into the proper use and some of the dangerous misuses of money.
[time=1215] If you'd like a copy, simply write to us today and we'll be glad to send you one.
[time=1222] For your free copy, right to the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1231] Once again, the address is the Bible Hour.
[time=1234] Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1240] Finally, let me encourage you to join us for the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=1244] It's each Thursday night here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1247] We have a different guest speaker.
[time=1249] Some of the greatest preachers of America will be here with us.
[time=1252] We're looking forward to the whole summer, and this week, we'll be having Dr. Bob Gromacki.
[time=1257] Bob is spoken here on a couple of occasions on Sunday mornings and years gone by.
[time=1262] He is a great Bible teacher.
[time=1264] He comes to us from Cedarville College, so all of you people out there are familiar with Cedarville, probably no Bob, but others of you, you'll have a great first-time experience if you could join us this Thursday at 7 o'clock for the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=1278] Thanks for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1280] As we go back to our morning worship service, we encourage you to open the scriptures and open your mind to a study of God's Word with us today.
[time=1289] But before that, we'll hear from Carla Wirley again.
[time=1310] [MUSIC - 314 seconds]
[time=1630] ♪ But what we need, desperately, is to go back to our first love, and to say to Him on our
[time=1643] knees daily, "Oh Lord, I need You in my life.
[time=1648] I need Your grace and Your strength and Your mercy and Your wisdom, and I need to spend
[time=1654] my time on the things of eternity and not on the things of this world that will pass
[time=1661] away." We need the Lord.
[time=1671] We need to know His grace to seek His holy face above the words of plain, and we need
[time=1687] the Lord.
[time=1691] We need His majesty to lend us dignity and to make us worthy of His name, and we need
[time=1706] to see Him there everywhere we tell, We need to look for Him, and how we need to know
[time=1723] how much we have to learn.
[time=1736] We need the Lord, and we need His light to see what is eternity in ordinary, daily things.
[time=1751] We need the Lord.
[time=1755] We need to cling to Him when we have reached the end of all our earthly hopes and dreams,
[time=1770] and in the desert of our pain, how we fear, the way that He is alone, when we suffer
[time=1789] with the light, He is light, the light of the world, leading us home.
[time=1810] We need to feel His touch, because we think we know so much, but how much more there is
[time=1827] we need to know, we need His fire within, that we might live for Him, and in His grace
[time=1845] we need to know how much we need, how much we need, how much we need, the Lord.
[time=1873] Thank you, Carla, let us bow together in prayer.
[time=1895] God we have been so gently reminded that we need you, Lord it is embarrassing to need
[time=1904] reminded.
[time=1905] I, for one, am guilty of, pride of self-sufficiency, the arrogance of thinking, I can meet all
[time=1915] my own needs, and all of us today, Lord, confess we need you.
[time=1923] We have tried to camouflage that need by filling our life with more things and more
[time=1930] people and more experience, and then more of all over again.
[time=1938] God we need you.
[time=1942] In spite of our own unwillingness to occasionally admit that we need you, Lord, and we need
[time=1949] you in this place today to teach us, I am incapable, and we need you.
[time=1958] God we ask you to teach us at a depth of spiritual insight that goes beyond human understanding.
[time=1965] We need wisdom that is from above.
[time=1969] We need applications that will transform lives today.
[time=1974] God we need your spirit to give us insight to heal some long, long hurts, some relationships
[time=1983] that have been severed and bitterness has sprung up like a wild weed.
[time=1988] God we need your insight to learn to say with effectiveness, I am sorry will you forgive
[time=1997] me.
[time=1998] Father we need your insight to affect change in our behavior, so that as we say we are
[time=2005] sorry, there will really be a difference in our walk.
[time=2010] God we need your insight into developing our values, we would be in a moment captured
[time=2016] by the secularization of our society if you do not teach us differently.
[time=2024] God we would also pray today for those who are suffering physically, Steve as he battles arthritis, Pete's mother as she faces surgery for cancer, Marv Deggits and his long, long
[time=2038] battle with an unnamed enemy.
[time=2043] God today we pray for your strength and grace for each of these.
[time=2048] Through your word we pray that you would give us a hunger and a thirst for righteousness
[time=2056] that our very appetites might please you in Jesus name, amen.
[time=2066] It is actually this year that America is 200 years old.
[time=2072] Of course all of us are familiar with the historic date July the 4th, 1776 and 11 years
[time=2079] ago we celebrated the bicentennial of our nation.
[time=2085] But in many ways it is this year that is the bicentennial of our nation.
[time=2090] It was 1776 that we declared our independence, but to declare your independence and then
[time=2097] to earn your independence are two separate matters that earning came about in what we call the revolutionary war and it culminated with Cornwallis surrendering to Washington
[time=2109] after the battle of Yorktown and we became independent.
[time=2113] But even at that date we were not a nation for once independence had been earned and forged
[time=2119] on the battlefield we were nothing more than 13 different little colonies totally separate
[time=2128] from each other not bound together yet as one nation loosely pulled together as a confederation
[time=2136] under an agreement called the Articles of Confederation but under the Articles of Confederation one
[time=2142] state our colony was completely independent from another and what money you used in Massachusetts
[time=2149] they may not honor in Georgia those that governed the land of Virginia had no influence over
[time=2157] the land of Connecticut and the years went by and these 13 colonies instead of uniting
[time=2165] were pulling apart and dividing and so a Congress was called 200 years ago this month in the
[time=2178] summer of 1787 for the express purpose of drawing up a document some type of agreement
[time=2186] that would bind these states together they would call it if they were successful a constitution
[time=2194] the delegates of each of the states met and their individualism was greater than their commitment to unity and they were about to dismiss in failure when the senior statesman
[time=2208] Benjamin Franklin took the floor and he addressed the chairman and he said I have lived sir
[time=2217] a very long time and the longer I live the more convincing proofs I see of this truth
[time=2227] that God governs the affairs of men if you learn no other quote of US history don't let
[time=2240] it be Patrick Henry's give me liberty or give me death don't let it be FDR's we have nothing
[time=2246] to fear but fear itself let it be Benjamin Franklin's statement before that continental
[time=2252] Congress gentleman I perceive that God governs in the affairs of men if you understand that
[time=2266] you will understand the real flow of history what is actually history well if you're a women's liver you may cross your arms and say history that's just what it is his story and we're going to get our share of it well that's one perspective of history and the
[time=2284] ancient days history was always interpreted as nothing more than a military struggle over
[time=2290] geopolitical lines the ancients simply measured history from one more to the next and that's
[time=2298] all it was what kingdom conquered what land but when we come to the age of enlightenment
[time=2307] new ideas begin to spring forth and they're no longer students of history who simply said
[time=2314] history is one military battle and secession after another but history is more a matter
[time=2320] of economics than it is military and it was Karl Marx who coined the phrase economic
[time=2326] determinism and that concept of history doesn't chase the military personalities it chases
[time=2334] economics because they are what determine how the politicians move and the politicians
[time=2341] then determine where the armies would march it's a completely different theory of history
[time=2348] economic determinism well then there was a man by the name of Hegel a German who said
[time=2354] no history is not necessarily military it's not economic it is a dialectical process he
[time=2362] called it by that he meant there was a predominant view he called that a thesis and there would
[time=2369] be those over here who would be anti the thesis and he called them antithesis and the two would
[time=2376] collide and neither would win and a third synthesis would be formed and so you had during the
[time=2384] the late Renaissance the the despotic monarchs but then out of the enlightenment came that
[time=2393] call of reason and so the two collided and you came up with enlightened despotism that
[time=2399] synthesis but that became the new thesis and out of that there rose up those who wanted more who came up with the concept of a republic and they collided and new synthesis was democracy
[time=2411] or those that say no history is an ever moving dialectical process there are others who more
[time=2418] tritely said no history is is a vague consciousness that actually repeats itself did you know
[time=2426] that history actually repeats itself did you know that since the year 1840 every US president
[time=2436] who was elected in a year divisible by 20 like 1840 1860 every one of those presidents has
[time=2444] died in office William Henry Harrison died in office he was elected in 1840 in 1860 Abraham
[time=2454] Lincoln was elected president he was assassinated in 1880 from the great state of Ohio James Garfield
[time=2464] was elected president he was assassinated one year later in eighteen or excuse me 1900 William
[time=2473] McKinley from the great state of Ohio was elected president United States he died in office the
[time=2484] gun of an assassin took a third president in 1820 Warren G Harding was elected president
[time=2494] from the great state of Ohio get the picture going to be from Ohio and elected in the year
[time=2503] ending divisible by 20 he died in office 1840 FDR was elected for a historic fourth term
[time=2514] but he didn't fill it he died in office 1960 John F Kennedy was assassinated history repeats
[time=2526] itself did you know that Abraham Lincoln had a secretary by the name of Kennedy and
[time=2533] that John Kennedy had a secretary by the name of Lincoln did you know both of them were
[time=2539] elected in the year 60 1860 in 1960 respectively did you know that Lincoln's assassin shot him
[time=2547] in a theater and ran to a warehouse do you know that Kennedy's assassin shot him from a warehouse and ran to a theater history repeats itself no I don't really believe that but what
[time=2562] is your theory of history doesn't repeat itself or is it dialectical is it economic or is it material you know what the scripture says exactly what Benjamin Franklin said it is a
[time=2573] matter of God's hand moving in history we're studying the book of proverbs turn with me
[time=2581] if you will to proverbs chapter 14 and verse 34 and we'll see this stated so clearly and
[time=2588] so simply perhaps this is what Franklin had in the back of his mind proverbs 14 verse 34 says
[time=2598] this righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people King James says righteousness
[time=2614] exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people what is actually history it is the
[time=2623] hand of God as he works out his determined will book of psalm says promotion does not
[time=2638] come from the east more from the west but it is the Lord's hand that raises one up and
[time=2647] takes another down the repeated word in the book of proverbs as it refers to the greatness
[time=2655] of a nation is the single word righteousness it occurs again and again and again here it
[time=2662] tells us that righteousness exalts a nation but what is righteousness well if you're from
[time=2669] our all misfriends righteousness is removing yourself from the modernness of this world
[time=2677] if you are from a conservative form of Christianity it might be we don't drink cuss smoke or cheer
[time=2684] run around with girls who do Rudy to to where the boys from the institute that may be your concept of righteousness we don't do all these things that everybody else is doing if you're
[time=2695] from a background like the the Mormons you may take it and say and we don't do any of those things or drink coffee either one what is righteousness you know in Jesus day that
[time=2709] was probably the predominant question what is righteousness and there were three different
[time=2716] groups of people who tried to define it there were scribes who systematically copied the
[time=2723] law and had a great deal of intellectual insight there were Sadducees who were the religious
[time=2730] liberals of the day and Pharisees the religious conservatives of the day and each of them
[time=2736] tried to boil down a system of righteousness that governed and dictated every move you
[time=2742] made or didn't make but in simplicity righteousness as far as God's concern is simply a matter
[time=2749] of two things one knowing his word and then secondly obeying it that's all righteousness
[time=2758] is it's not a system of denominational beliefs it is not a system whether it establishes
[time=2766] a subculture it is simply knowing God's word and doing what it says that is righteousness
[time=2778] and righteousness is the strength of a nation that's what Proverbs will teach us today what
[time=2786] will righteousness do for a nation well turn now if you will to Proverbs 16 and verse 12
[time=2793] will discover today three things that righteousness will do for this nation Proverbs 16 verse
[time=2801] 12 says kings take pleasure I'm in verse 13 excuse me verse 12 kings detest wrong doing
[time=2812] why for a throne is established through righteousness you see that a throne a kingdom a nation is
[time=2821] not established through military might nor economic determinism nor is it simply inherited
[time=2829] from followed all the son that actually what establishes a throne is righteousness Solomon
[time=2836] tried to teach it to his son but his son would not learn it Solomon ran a nation according
[time=2843] to the principles of God's word and of righteousness but his son Rehoboam would not follow in his steps and he lost the kingdom he still had the army he still had the economic wealth
[time=2855] but he lost the kingdom when he lost righteousness a nation is established on the foundation of
[time=2868] its character there are those who have written about the greatness of America what made America
[time=2878] great there are those that speak of its vast economic resources and from coast to coast
[time=2886] we are a land rich in natural resources our coal our iron ore our natural gas our petroleum
[time=2893] our gold and silver in the mountains you know what we're no richer than the land of Venezuela
[time=2904] in terms of natural resources and we're probably not as rich as the land of Mexico in terms
[time=2910] of natural resources there's more oil in Mexico and in Venezuela there's more gold that Cortez
[time=2918] is found in the land of Mexico than the 49ers dug out of California well if it's not our
[time=2928] natural resources perhaps it was our foundation in terms of of the lands that discovered American
[time=2936] what they put here same people that discovered the United States discovered Mexico and discovered
[time=2943] Central American discovered South America we were colonized by the same people it's not
[time=2949] who we are as Americans unless you're an Indian you're there's no such thing as an American my family is Heinz 57 we got some German some English we got some cocker spaniel we've got
[time=2960] some you know we're just nuts that's what most of you are we aren't an ethnic people
[time=2970] superior we're not even an ethnic people let alone superior what is it then that made America
[time=2979] great Proverbs 25 5 repeats what we just read in chapter 16 it says this remove the wicked
[time=2990] from the king's presence and his throne will be established through righteousness it is
[time=2999] righteousness that establishes a nation listen to the words of Daniel Webster Daniel Webster
[time=3008] was a contemporary of men like Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay the first fourth of the 1800s
[time=3017] Webster said our ancestors established their system of government on morality and religious
[time=3026] sentiment moral habits they believe cannot be safely trusted on any other foundation than
[time=3033] religious principle or can any government be secure which is not supported by moral habits
[time=3043] know what Webster was saying here the most elegant statesmen of the 1900s said this that the
[time=3049] strength of a nation is its character its morality its foundation is ethical not economical
[time=3061] this nation was established because it had a foundation of righteousness was every man
[time=3069] woman and child a believer in Christ and righteous no but the concept of what a man and a woman
[time=3076] ought to be was that of a righteous one probably the most intellectually gifted of all presidents
[time=3087] we have ever had would have been Woodrow Wilson he let us safely through World War One and
[time=3093] established the League of Nations the predecessor to the United Nations here is Wilson's view
[time=3100] of U.S. history the Bible said Woodrow Wilson is the one supreme source of revelation of
[time=3110] the meaning of life the nature of God and spiritual nature and the need of men it is the only
[time=3122] guide of life which really leads the spirit in the way of peace and of salvation that's
[time=3130] not from some country here preacher who's paid to say all those Bible things that comes
[time=3137] from president Woodrow Wilson this concept righteousness establishes a nation there's
[time=3150] a second concept now we've already read it in Proverbs 1434 righteousness exalts a nation
[time=3158] but sin as a reproach to any people what will righteousness do for a nation first of all it will establish it secondly it will exalted what does the word exalt mean the word exalt
[time=3170] simply means to take something and to lift it up we often say lift up the name of Jesus
[time=3178] that means to exalt it to lift it up in another way it actually means to exalt means when God exalts something it's not only they lift it up but he sends down his blessing and that
[time=3189] in turn lifts it up how can a nation that's been established be exalted how can it rise
[time=3198] love others and become the cream of the crop the very thing that established it will exalt
[time=3204] it righteousness exalts a nation if you have your hymnbook let me show you a hymn hymn
[time=3215] hymn number 780 in our blue hymn book it's called oh beautiful for spacious skies that's
[time=3224] how the first verse begins for amber waves of grain for purple mountain magices above
[time=3232] the fruited plain America America God shed his grace on thee and here's the line I want
[time=3242] you to see and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea when Kathleen Lee Bates
[time=3253] wrote that she understood this principle righteousness exalt a nation because she said that God would
[time=3261] crown our good you see God will only crown God will only exalt an individual or a collection
[time=3272] of individuals a nation that has honored him by following his principles in his word it is
[time=3280] righteousness that establishes a nation and it is righteousness that exalts a nation
[time=3286] finally it is righteousness endures a nation our country is young in that we are only 200 years old
[time=3301] but we are old in terms of our exalted position it is rare that an empire a nation would last
[time=3310] at its peak for 200 years the decline often comes sooner what is it that will guard a nation
[time=3319] from falling that will allow it to endure that was the wish of Abraham Lincoln when he gave
[time=3328] his fame to Gettysburg address he said that the battle of Gettysburg had been fought so that this
[time=3335] government of the people by the people and for the people should not perish
[time=3343] from the earth he wanted it to endure it is righteousness that will cause it to endure
[time=3352] proverbs 11 14 for the lack of guidance a nation falls but many advisors make victory sure
[time=3363] chapter 11 verse 4 wealth is worthless in the day of wrath but righteousness delivers from death
[time=3374] in Proverbs 13 6 righteousness guards the man of integrity but wickedness overthrows
[time=3384] the center how shall this nation last it will last if and only if we understand
[time=3397] that which keeps a nation secure is their obedience to the principles of God's word the strength of
[time=3407] our nation is not the Pentagon and all the forces that those leaders control the strength of our
[time=3414] nation is not our dollar and how it compares to the yen or the pound or the frank the strength of a
[time=3422] nation is not its political resources military or economic resources but the strength of a nation
[time=3428] is its spiritual roots that is what establishes a nation that is what exalts a nation it is that
[time=3442] which lifts a nation up and perpetuates it and causes it to endure these words of warning were
[time=3456] first penned by Thomas Jefferson cautious words of warning God who gave us life gave us liberty
[time=3470] can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties
[time=3480] are a gift from God indeed I tremble for my country what I reflect that God is just
[time=3488] and that his justice cannot sleep forever
