[time=90] (bells ringing) - In his excellent book, 12 myths that could destroy America,
[time=119] Erwin Luther contains this insight from the words of Aldous Huxley.
[time=124] Huxley was asked on a television interview, "Why do you believe that evolution was so readily accepted in our society?"
[time=133] Huxley responded with these indicting words.
[time=137] He said, "The reason why we have accepted evolution, even without proof, is because we do not want God to interfere with our sexual morals."
[time=148] (bells ringing)
[time=153] [MUSIC]
[time=161] - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=165] Thank you for joining us.
[time=167] Rick's message today is taken from Proverbs chapter 14 and is entitled, "Righteousness Exults a Nation." Those words of Huxley are alarming, blunt, and openly indicting.
[time=180] Proverbs 14, 34 says, "Righteousness Exults a Nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people." Two weeks ago, we looked at the first half of this proverb.
[time=190] We saw the positive benefits of righteousness for our country.
[time=194] Today, we will study the second half of Proverbs 14, 34, the warning that sin is a disgrace.
[time=201] Often we shy away from words of correction, but today's is an important one.
[time=207] Please locate your Bible so that you are able to study along with us.
[time=211] Our text, again, is Proverbs chapter 14, verse 34.
[time=216] Our sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=221] Other special music includes a solo from Lisa McNamara
[time=227] and Dennis Kirschner.
[time=230] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=239] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=244] Now here's Rick.
[time=245] Welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible hour.
[time=248] This weekend as we as a nation celebrate 211 years of freedom
[time=254] and enjoyment of God's blessing.
[time=256] We've come today not only to praise God for America, but moreover to praise God for who he is.
[time=262] And we're thankful that you're a part of this service today.
[time=265] Last weekend we celebrated this holiday with the patriotic panorama and we enjoyed that music so much we wanted to share this song from that package with you this morning that speaks of America, of our liberty and of God's blessing.
[time=286] [MUSIC - 154 seconds]
[time=451] >> May we cherish the liberty that we have in America and the opportunity to stand for and stand up for our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=458] We stand up, stand up for Jesus is the theme of our next hymn 618.
[time=463] We'll sing the first, third and fourth stanzas together 618.
[time=469] [MUSIC - 188 seconds]
[time=659] >> Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=661] We'll continue with music now as our soloist Lisa McNamara comes to sing.
[time=666] Song it's entitled Bring Back the Glory.
[time=669] Perhaps today this will be a song the text will allow you to recall that you had a relationship with Jesus Christ and perhaps that slipped some in the recent weeks.
[time=679] He can restore the joy of your salvation.
[time=682] Let's listen now as she sings for us.
[time=685] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=763] Bring back the glory.
[time=770] Won't you show us what life is for.
[time=776] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=961] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=965] This is a holiday weekend the 4th of July just passed yesterday, but we're sharing this broadcast with you one week delayed.
[time=973] So you're able to enjoy today some of the patriotic music that we celebrated here over the holiday weekend.
[time=979] Pete, I certainly enjoyed the Panorama last week in the music this week.
[time=983] Oh, Rick, it was exciting again to celebrate the birthday of our country, and especially to commemorate the 200th year of our Constitution.
[time=991] It was a great time, and some of the music that we're using today is part of the celebration that we had at our patriotic Panorama.
[time=998] Well, I certainly enjoyed the Panorama and also the special music today, and in just a few moments you're going to hear the American National Anthem, the Star Spangled Banner.
[time=1008] That'll be great.
[time=1009] That'll be exciting.
[time=1010] And speaking of music, we have our Summer Bible Conference, Rick, and on July 30th, that's a Thursday evening, Bert Kettinger will be with us.
[time=1017] Bert is a great baritone singer, has a great message.
[time=1020] He's heard on radio often here on our local stations, and has a great ministry.
[time=1025] I'm looking forward to Bert being here.
[time=1027] That's July the 30th, and we hope you'll set that evening aside, and come and join us right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 7 o'clock, July the 30th, as Bert is here in concert.
[time=1039] We've mentioned already a couple of times that we're now one week delayed.
[time=1043] That's always been true in South Ben and Marion, and that will be true in Lime, Ohio, where we're just starting to broadcast.
[time=1050] But historically, we've been live here in Fort Wayne at 11 o'clock.
[time=1055] The station, Channel 21, went through some programming changes, and we've been moved to 7 o'clock.
[time=1060] We're certainly thankful for this hour, but would really prefer to be live in at 11 o'clock, and if that's your spirit as well as ours, we would encourage you to write Channel 21 and let them know that.
[time=1072] Please write, and please write graciously.
[time=1075] You could write to the station manager, Mr. Ed Medcalf.
[time=1079] The address is 21 alive, box 21, 21, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1086] and the zip code is 46801.
[time=1090] Allow me to give that to you again, Mr. Ed Medcalf.
[time=1093] Our 21 alive, box 21, 21, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46801.
[time=1103] Then while you're in the spirit of writing, we want to encourage you to write to us for a helpful little booklet that we have for you on the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1112] Throughout the summer, weeks we'll be studying the Book of Proverbs, and this booklet is actually an index to key topics in the Proverbs.
[time=1120] It's entitled Promises from Proverbs.
[time=1124] This booklet will be a helpful tool to help you to get ready access to some of the key teachings in the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1132] You may want to know what God's word has to say about anger, or finances, or such spiritual topics as doubt, or planning for the future.
[time=1142] Where can you go to get those in a quick moment?
[time=1146] Well, this index will take you through the Book of Proverbs in a topical way, and we have a copy for you and it's free simply for writing and asking for it.
[time=1154] So write today.
[time=1156] If you'd like the booklet on Promises from Proverbs, write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1166] That's the Bible Hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1174] Pete mentioned earlier, Bert Kenninger in the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=1178] Each Thursday night of the summer, June, July and August, we have a special guest in to challenge us with God's word.
[time=1186] Coming next Thursday will be George Joseph.
[time=1190] George is the pastor of Faith Baptist Church in South Bend, Indiana. He is a live, vivacious man of God, and he'll challenge your heart.
[time=1200] So we want to invite you friends who are throughout the Bible Hour Network to come and join us for George's teaching of God's word next Thursday night and every Thursday night to be a part of the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=1212] Again, thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today and we trust that as we go back to the rest of our morning worship service that God will use this hour to draw you into a walk-out prize.
[time=1224] Today as we're studying, we're studying from the Book of Proverbs that righteousness exalts a nation.
[time=1230] [MUSIC - 216 seconds]
[time=1462] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1468] Thank you, Dennis.
[time=1470] Why would a church have a panorama that's theme is patriotism?
[time=1475] Why would we sing of patriotic songs in a morning worship service?
[time=1479] It's simply this.
[time=1481] That a nation who honors God is blessed by God.
[time=1485] A nation that is not honor God, God will not honor.
[time=1492] And so we as a church have before us the opportunity to thank God for what he has done in our country
[time=1498] and to endeavor to steer our country and allegiance to God.
[time=1501] For as this kingdom serves the purposes of God's eternal kingdom, then God will serve this kingdom over.
[time=1509] And so this morning we have asked Lisa to sing our national anthem.
[time=1512] I think it's appropriate if we all stand and enjoy and also reverently listen to our national anthem, the Star Spangled Banner.
[time=1521] Would you please stand?
[time=1523] [MUSIC - 331 seconds]
[time=1869] Thank you, Lisa.
[time=1871] Thank you for your attention and devotion.
[time=1874] Let us pray together.
[time=1876] God, as we have heard this morning and so often, son, we now pray to you.
[time=1883] Long may that star-spangled banner wave over the land of the free
[time=1891] and the home of the brave.
[time=1895] God, we say to you today that we love you and we love this country.
[time=1904] And God, we know that the greatness of America is the greatness of our God.
[time=1911] And we confess to you our national sins, the chief of which is our spiritual indifference, our casual ignoring of you.
[time=1923] We know that all that we have and all that we possess is a gift from you.
[time=1929] Liberty, our prosperity, it all comes from you.
[time=1934] And we humbly acknowledge today that you are God and we pledge ourselves a fresh today to serve you.
[time=1945] And we humbly ask for your great blessing, your richest blessing to be poured out on this country.
[time=1953] God, we would ask today for unusual wisdom for our leaders, for President Reagan, Vice President Bush, the members of the Cabinet, that as they make decisions that would shape the destiny of our country, they would ever be mindful that righteousness exalts a nation.
[time=1972] God, we would pray for our congressmen and senators.
[time=1975] We thank you for Godly men like Dan Coates and Jeremiah Denton, men who love you and who want to shape this nation in a way pleasing to you
[time=1986] and for the good of all of our people.
[time=1989] God, we pray for the new appointees and the next appointee to our Supreme Court
[time=1995] that as they make decisions, their decisions might be rooted in a foundation of ethics,
[time=2001] not simply in popularity of the movement of the day, but in the eternal ethic.
[time=2007] God, we would pray today, most of all, for each of us as individuals
[time=2014] that we might know Christ and that might knowing Him walk an obedience
[time=2022] for its sin that is a reproach to any people.
[time=2027] So today, God, give us a hunger not for greatness, but for goodness.
[time=2035] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2042] It was Alexis de Tocqueville, the French political analyst who came to the United States
[time=2048] during the middle of the 1800s, who said, "America is great because America is good.
[time=2059] And if America ever ceases to be good, she will then cease to be great."
[time=2069] The Tocqueville was right not only because of the brilliance of his sociologically trained mind,
[time=2075] but because that which he said was only a paraphrase of that which God had said
[time=2081] in Proverbs 14, verse 34.
[time=2084] If you have your Bible with you today, I invite you to open it to the book of Proverbs.
[time=2088] We'll be studying there exclusively today.
[time=2091] So if you find that one book, you just have to find the verses.
[time=2095] Proverbs is an Old Testament book of wisdom, proverbial, which means timeless wisdom
[time=2102] that comes from the heart of God to give insight into living today.
[time=2108] Practical advice on things like, "Should you save your money or spend it all?"
[time=2114] "When should you speak and when should you guard your tongue?" And today it speaks of that which makes a nation great. Proverbs 14, 34 reads like this.
[time=2125] Righteousness exults a nation, but sin is a shame, a disgrace, a reproach to any people.
[time=2137] That is a proverb. It is a general statement that is generally true.
[time=2144] There are those that want to ignore this particular passage because they say, "Well, the Old Testament was written to Israel." So that's saying that if Israel is righteous, God would exalt Israel.
[time=2154] Well, that statement is partially true. God would exalt a righteous Israel.
[time=2158] But this is proverbial literature. It's wisdom for the ages, not exclusively given to Israel.
[time=2165] And the phrase bears that truth. It says sin is a reproach, not just to a covenant people like Israel, but to any people. This is for us. This is timeless.
[time=2177] It was true when Solomon wrote it 900 plus years before the birth of Christ.
[time=2182] It is true now 2,000 years after the birth of Christ.
[time=2186] It is a timeless eternal principle that will guide your life and mine and will give guidance to our nation collectively.
[time=2196] Let me pretend I am an English teacher which I ain't.
[time=2202] This particular proverb is what we would call a parallelism.
[time=2207] A contrasting parallelism. Notice the structure. It says righteousness now.
[time=2212] We won't quiz you here, but let me help you by way of parts of speech.
[time=2216] That's a noun. Righteousness exalts, that's a verb, a nation.
[time=2222] The nation, that noun, is the beneficiary of the righteousness that exalts.
[time=2228] So it goes noun, verb, noun. Got that? It's a deep stuff now.
[time=2233] Now look at the next phrase. It says sin, that's a noun, is a disgrace.
[time=2238] That's a verb structure in the original Hebrew to any people.
[time=2243] You see what they did? They went noun, verb, noun.
[time=2246] They're parallel, but they contrast. One says this righteousness.
[time=2252] This one says sin. This one says exalt.
[time=2257] This one says is an embarrassment. It's a disgrace.
[time=2263] Now what's the point of making all this grammatical observation?
[time=2267] When the Hebrews put something into a rhythmic pattern, they did it for one purpose.
[time=2273] Do you know what that purpose was? To aid in memorization.
[time=2280] God not only wants us to hear it, he not only wants to know it conceptually, God intended this to be memorized.
[time=2289] Do you know that in the days of Solomon, when a boy reached his age of adulthood,
[time=2295] we now know the celebration of the bemitzvah.
[time=2298] He would be 13 years of age, and it would be expected of him that he could quote the Torah.
[time=2307] The Torah is the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
[time=2318] How are you doing on John 3, 16? Five long books, they memorized it.
[time=2329] Why? Because they wanted to have the mind of God.
[time=2336] You can't have the mind of God by osmosis.
[time=2340] You can't have the mind of God by going to a celebration like this on Sunday morning, or somebody says a few words. You only have the mind of God by devoting your work
[time=2351] and your life to God's Word, and they memorized it.
[time=2356] David said, "Thy word have I hid in my heart so that I might not sin against you."
[time=2365] You are struggling with sin today. I know that because I am, and we have the same ancestry.
[time=2370] We are all struggling with sin, and the greatest antidote for sin is memorizing the key passages
[time=2377] that deal with those sins of which you are struggling.
[time=2381] And so here is a phrase that leaps out of the pages of Proverbs.
[time=2386] Righteousness exalts a nation, and we spent last Sunday talking about the fact that righteousness establishes
[time=2392] it exalts, and it endures a nation. That was the good news.
[time=2398] These next words are more corrective in nature, and we, out of our human nature,
[time=2404] shun away from words of correction, we tend to gravitate to those people who say the nice things.
[time=2410] But this next phrase says, "But sin is a reproach to any people."
[time=2417] I think there are three things that this book of Proverbs says at least about the consequences of sin in a nation.
[time=2426] This is the first. Sin is a reproach to any people.
[time=2431] The word reproach, the new international version puts it this way. It is a disgrace.
[time=2437] I like the word shame. It is a cause for moral embarrassment.
[time=2444] We've reached a point in our society where we are approaching shamelessness.
[time=2451] You see to have shame there must be sin. And for there to be sin there must be law.
[time=2457] There must be an ethical standard. But in our society we have said there are no ethics.
[time=2462] Everything is situational. So since there is no law, then there is no sin.
[time=2467] You have not sinned unless you violated the law. And since there is no law, there is no shame.
[time=2472] Therefore, if you want to go to Florida and go to North Lito Beach outside of Sarasota and just take off your clothes,
[time=2478] you don't have shame because there is no ethic that says you shouldn't do that.
[time=2483] So if you can make money by taking your body and displaying it on the page of pornography,
[time=2489] there is no shame to that where you be the hostess of a television game show or a Miss America.
[time=2495] There is no shame associated with that. There is only money.
[time=2500] There is an actress by the name of Bette Midler. Her films, Your Children Should Not See, Your Teenagers Should Not See,
[time=2511] You Should Not See, Your Grandparents Should Not See.
[time=2516] She has long been known for her sensuous lusty roles.
[time=2522] Bette Midler was on a television talk show not long ago. She is a little older.
[time=2528] She is now a mother, and she is much the wiser.
[time=2533] She now laments her films and her lifestyles. She said, "I have a little girl.
[time=2541] I hope my little girl never sees these films of her mom."
[time=2549] That's the consequences of sin. It is shame. It's reproach. It is disgrace.
[time=2560] And often in our intoxication with the fascinations of sin, we say, "I'll risk it, or I won't have that problem."
[time=2570] But truth and time go hand in hand. You see, the life that we live, we will live with the natural consequences of their choices today for the rest of our life.
[time=2588] Do you think those people who now own the rights to all of Midler's films, who are making monies off of the videotape business, the film release business, the television business, are going to say,
[time=2603] "Oh, Bette, we'll trash them all. Forget the profits. They will play again, and again, and again."
[time=2614] The consequences of our sins, too, will linger whether they be on videotape or not.
[time=2621] See, the Bible says here, "sin is a reproach. It says to people. It's a reproach on ourselves.
[time=2628] It is we who suffer when we sin." The Bible also says that it is a reproach to God, and that may be the bigger issue.
[time=2638] Proverbs 28, verse 9, "Just a passing thought of Solomon's." It says, "If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, then his prayers are detestable."
[time=2650] Now, Israel was what we would call a theocracy.
[time=2654] We are a democracy. The democracy demos means many.
[time=2659] We are the rule of the many, the majority rules in our country.
[time=2664] A theocracy then means the rule of theos, which is the Greek word for God.
[time=2669] A theocracy was the rule of God.
[time=2672] Israel was under the theocracy of God, so there are laws as a nation for the laws of God.
[time=2681] God says, "If anyone turns a deaf ear to the law, then their prayers are detestable."
[time=2690] They are a reproach. God rejects them totally.
[time=2696] What does it mean to turn a deaf ear?
[time=2699] It doesn't mean that you're physically, organically, and capable of hearing.
[time=2703] It may mean that you actually hear, but you ignore.
[time=2709] I have a friend who makes his livelihood by selling hearing aids.
[time=2716] He said, "You'd be surprised at how many women call and make appointments for their husband." They said, "He just can't hear me when I talk to him at all." So the salesman comes out, gives a test, says, "Madam, your husband could hear a pin drop across the Coliseum during a hockey game."
[time=2738] Best hearing I've ever tested anyone to have.
[time=2741] It's called selective perception.
[time=2744] The ability to tune in and to tune out, to turn a deaf ear to ignore.
[time=2753] We are in danger that we have ignored God.
[time=2758] He says, "It is detestable to me." That on the one hand, you close your ear.
[time=2767] On the other hand, you pray and say, "Oh, God." God said, "That's a reproach. It's a disgrace.
[time=2776] It is a shame. It is detestable." God expects holiness and he demands consistency.
[time=2787] And the fact that God is of his very nature, holy, is so compelling that when Isaiah the Prophet
[time=2795] got a glimpse of God, not a view of God, just a glimpse through the shadow of the seraphim.
[time=2803] And as they shouted forth, "Holy, holy, holy," Isaiah says, "Woe is me, for I am undone.
[time=2812] I am in the midst of unclean people."
[time=2818] We do not even consider God's holiness.
[time=2821] And then we say, "Hey, God, like is this impersonal vending machine that we simply deposit our prayers
[time=2828] in the form of tokens and pull the appropriate lever of our ones." God says sin is a reproach to me.
[time=2837] The second thing that Proverbs says about sin is not only that it leads to reproach, but it leads to rebellion.
[time=2847] Learn with me, if you will, to chapter 29, verse 18.
[time=2851] Proverbs 29, verse 18.
[time=2855] It says, "Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint,
[time=2863] but blessed is he who keeps the law." It says, "Where there is no revelation, that means a word from God."
[time=2873] People rebel, they cast off restraint.
[time=2877] They say, "Who are you to roll over me, or who made that law that I should keep it?"
[time=2884] They cast off any type of restraint.
[time=2889] But in contrast, blessed are the people who keep the law.
[time=2895] The casting off of restraint is the next step.
[time=2898] Once we disregard God's law and we are willing to embrace shame,
[time=2904] then there comes a subtle revolution.
[time=2908] Turn to chapter 11.
[time=2911] Proverbs 11.
[time=2914] Verse 11 says, "Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
[time=2920] but by the mouth of the wicked." That's where rebellion really takes place in the mouth.
[time=2927] By the mouth of the wicked, it is destroyed.
[time=2930] Chapter 13, verse 6.
[time=2932] Righteousness guards the man of integrity, but wickedness overthrows rebellion.
[time=2941] The sinner.
[time=2944] We are already midway, if not on the final phases of another revolution in our country.
[time=2952] This one will not be a revolution with another political force like the Revolutionary War with England.
[time=2958] It has not, nor will be fought largely with guns and bullets.
[time=2965] It is not a coup d'état like a quinoa overthrowing the Marcos regime, or is it a political struggle like the Sandinistas and the Contras.
[time=2974] It is a spiritual struggle to which Paul looted in Ephesians 6 when he said, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers and spiritual darkness in high places." It is an ethical revolution that has already captivated our country.
[time=2994] You see, our Constitution is amended with ten original amendments called the Bill of Rights.
[time=3002] One of those, the first grants the freedom of speech and of the press.
[time=3008] But in the revolution that's taken place, that does not no longer guard the rights of the ordinary citizen.
[time=3017] It has become the sword in the hand of the penographer.
[time=3022] They own the first amendments.
[time=3027] Our country has become so involved with the criminal that we are far more concerned about the rights of the criminal in our society
[time=3037] than the rights of the victim.
[time=3039] If you are a lady today and if you have been assaulted and attacked and sexually violated,
[time=3045] you are the defendant in the chair of the courtroom, not your assailant.
[time=3055] We have gone through a revolution in our classrooms to the point where humanism has so dominated higher education
[time=3063] that it not only dictates what is taught in the classroom, they now control the courts.
[time=3069] In 1980, our generation, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky ordinance that called for the posting of the Ten Commandments
[time=3080] and said, "That is unconstitutional in our school." You know, in the schools of Kentucky, you cannot say, "Tha shall not commit adultery."
[time=3090] That is a moral statement that is rooted in religion.
[time=3094] Throw it out.
[time=3097] Pete Coby just told me this morning.
[time=3099] I thrilled to hear it.
[time=3101] He was flying back from California.
[time=3104] He was reading Time magazine, and there they had the speeches of significant commencement addresses that were made
[time=3110] this graduation season.
[time=3111] Included was Ted Coppels, ABC commentators.
[time=3116] Pete said that Coppels' words were something like this.
[time=3120] He said, "We do not maintain morality because of fear of AIDS or venereal disease.
[time=3129] We maintain morality because it is ethically right." God did not give us ten suggestions.
[time=3137] He gave us ten commandments.
[time=3140] I thrilled to hear somebody of his stature and somebody who is not a preacher say that there are ethical standards.
[time=3148] We have lost those in our society.
[time=3151] We have lost those.
[time=3153] They are gone.
[time=3154] We are not in the process of losing them.
[time=3157] They are gone.
[time=3158] I don't mind the new seat belt law, but I find it so comical that I can get a ticket.
[time=3166] I have my daughters right in the front seat of my car without a seat belt, but they are free to get an abortion.
[time=3175] That is the point of ludicrous our nation has come to.
[time=3179] It is all right if I want to kill them the day before they are born, but I will get a ticket the day after they are born if they don't have a seat belt on.
[time=3192] That is where that came from, but all this Huxley tell you where that came from.
[time=3197] Huxley was asking the television interview, "Why is it that our nation has accepted evolution so quickly?"
[time=3205] Huxley said, "Huxley is not a believer. Huxley is the avant garde."
[time=3211] Huxley said, "These are the quotes.
[time=3214] The reason we accepted Darwinism even without proof is because we don't want God to interfere with our sexual morals."
[time=3224] That is why we believe in Darwinism.
[time=3227] For you see, the implications of evolution are far greater than evolution itself.
[time=3234] Evolution is an important issue, but far more important than the issue of creationism versus evolution are the implications that if evolution is true,
[time=3243] there is no creator.
[time=3245] And if there is no creator, there is no accountability in life.
[time=3252] That's why we have accepted evolution in Darwinism, not because we think it's brilliant science,
[time=3261] but because we like what it says about my privileges to exploit life without restraint.
[time=3271] That revolution has already swept through our country.
[time=3275] Why sin is a reproach and sin leads to revolution against God?
[time=3289] Abraham Lincoln said these words.
[time=3294] We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven. We have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity.
[time=3304] We have grown in numbers, wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown.
[time=3314] But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which has preserved us in peace,
[time=3324] multiplied, enriched and strengthened us.
[time=3331] We have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that all these blessing were produced by some superior wisdom are virtue of our own.
[time=3348] Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace.
[time=3363] Too proud to pray to the God who has made us. It behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended power,
[time=3375] to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.
[time=3385] Those are the words that he spoke when he called our nation not to a day of prayer, but to a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer.
[time=3395] You see we have token days of prayer. I'm all for those days of prayer, but you know what? There has to be humiliation.
[time=3403] There has to be that sense of awareness of sin. Our God says it's detestable.
[time=3411] The prayers are detestable. Sin is a reproach. It leads to an ethical rebellion against God.
[time=3419] And when that rebellion takes place, then finally sin leads to ruin. Proverbs 11 and 11, we just read it.
[time=3430] Through the blessing of the upright, a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked, it is destroyed.
[time=3439] Verse 14 of the same chapter says, "The lack of guidance for the lack of guidance a nation falls."
[time=3450] You see, when we ignore God, he then withdrawals his hand of blessing from us.
[time=3455] God gave the same words to Isaiah the prophet. Here's what Isaiah tried to warn the nation of Israel.
[time=3462] "Hear, O heavens, listen to earth, for the Lord has spoken." I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. The ox knows his master.
[time=3473] The donkey is owners, but Israel does not know me.
[time=3482] My people do not understand. A sinful nation. A people loaded with guilt. A brood of evil doers.
[time=3490] Children give them to corruption. They have forsaken the Lord. They have spurned the Holy One of Israel, and they turn their back on Him.
[time=3501] That says it's over. You see, well, that's just Israel. Fine. Read the book of Obadiah.
[time=3506] It's one chapter. It's not written to Israel. It's not written to Judah. It's written to eat them.
[time=3510] A foreign country in God's head for your sins. I'll bring you down to ruin.
[time=3520] We shared with you this morning inspirational music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Dennis Kirschner and Lisa McNamara.
[time=3530] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3533] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to follow Christ and make Him your personal Savior,
[time=3539] I'd like to have you bow and pray this prayer with me. We bow your heads.
[time=3544] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3551] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to come in to forgive me and to cleanse me
[time=3558] for the sins that I've committed. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3564] If you prayed that prayer this morning, would you write us and tell us that you prayed?
[time=3568] We'll send you a booklet entitled Your Decision. This booklet will help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3575] To receive a copy of Your Decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled Promises from Proverbs,
[time=3583] please write to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
