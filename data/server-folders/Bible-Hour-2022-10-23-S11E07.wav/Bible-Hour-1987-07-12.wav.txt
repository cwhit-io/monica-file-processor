[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=113] He had risen to a position of political power that he controlled the biggest government in his world.
[time=122] He personally had accumulated wealth beyond the imagination.
[time=126] In terms of personal pleasure, he not only tasted but he'd indulged himself and everything life could afford.
[time=135] His name was Solomon.
[time=137] And now he writes to his sons his advice is practical, it's insightful.
[time=144] He speaks of finances and political power.
[time=147] He speaks of wealth and pleasure.
[time=150] But he says more than anything else, guard your heart, guard it.
[time=158] (dramatic music)
[time=170] - Welcome to an inspirational hour of Bible study and special music on the Bible hour.
[time=175] Thank you for joining us.
[time=177] Rick is speaking today from Proverbs chapter four.
[time=180] In a message he has entitled managing ourselves.
[time=184] That is Solomon's timeless critical advice above all else, guard your heart.
[time=190] Jesus himself identified the heart as the source of life.
[time=195] Knowing and guarding your heart is no small challenge.
[time=198] As Jeremiah the prophet asked, "Who can know his own heart?" That is the issue in today's study.
[time=204] The first in a series from Proverbs on managing our lives.
[time=209] Please locate your Bibles and have them open to Proverbs chapter four.
[time=213] We will be looking at verses 20 through 27.
[time=216] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=220] As well as our special guest today, the disciple singers from Calvary Baptist Church in Covington, Kentucky.
[time=228] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=239] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=242] Now here's Rick.
[time=246] - Our friends who join us now for the Bible hour and we trust that those of you are here and those of you who join by way of television, all will be encouraged through God's word, through the music that is sung and all that we can share together today.
[time=260] It's our prayers desire that it will glorify God and in turn, God's love and grace will come to each of us shining down as the very gift of eternal life itself.
[time=272] Our choir sings of that theme of God's grace shining down in this next song.
[time=276] (upbeat music)
[time=291] [MUSIC - 182 seconds]
[time=487] What a privilege it is to have the glow in our hearts and then let it shine out through the area representing our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=494] There is joy in serving Jesus.
[time=496] We're going to sing that song.
[time=498] It's found in 615.
[time=500] We'll sing the first, second and fourth stanzas together, 615.
[time=505] (gentle music)
[time=517] [MUSIC - 144 seconds]
[time=666] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=673] We appreciate it when you sing along and join in as we worship together.
[time=677] Several months ago I had the privilege of going down to Covington, Kentucky to the Calvary Baptist Church.
[time=685] Was there on a Sunday afternoon and evening and then on Monday morning working together with their youth program and the area of music in preparation for a spring tour that these young people took and then another tour that they have just begun today coming from Covington going up through Michigan and other of our states in this area.
[time=705] The group was under the direction as their youth pastor of Tom Hedges.
[time=710] I knew Tom many years ago as he was in California when I was out there.
[time=715] And then the group that's coming right now is the disciple singers and they're directed by Connie Faulkner.
[time=721] The puppeteers are in our chapel working with our children's choir.
[time=725] You heard the handbell choir as they played the prelude for you and we're just delighted that these young people are serving the Lord.
[time=732] They look great, they sound good, they love the Lord and just an encouragement to see young people from other churches serving God in their areas of ability and we thank the Lord for them.
[time=743] Let's listen now as they sing a great song about celebrating life in Jesus Christ.
[time=749] (upbeat music)
[time=756] [MUSIC - 133 seconds]
[time=892] (audience applauds) - Hello again, and we are so thankful
[time=903] you've joined us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=906] We have some special guests with us from Kentucky who are providing much of the music today.
[time=910] Rick, just a couple of months ago, I was down at the Calvary Baptist Church in Covington, Kentucky working with their youth department in particular in music and in preparation for a tour.
[time=920] And that time has come now where they're touring Michigan and Ohio and Indiana.
[time=925] And we have them here this morning.
[time=927] It's the youth department from the Calvary Baptist Church in Covington, Kentucky.
[time=931] Their youth director is Tom Hedges.
[time=932] I've known him for many years.
[time=934] And they're not only in our worship service here, but they have puppets that are in the children's ministry and handbell choir and just a number of activities that they do as a youth department and then take out in the summer.
[time=946] We're delighted to have this youth ensemble with us from Covington, Kentucky.
[time=950] Well, Calvary Baptist is a real church of renowned.
[time=953] A number of years ago, Warren Waresby was their pastor.
[time=955] And I remember the name of the church, though I haven't had the privilege that you have had of being there and being a part of the church.
[time=962] We're looking forward to our church's expansion in the future, tonight our church will be holding a congregational business meeting, which is the last meeting we'll have before we launch out into the full expansion of our new building.
[time=976] So over the next weeks, if you drive by state and pass our facilities and look across the street from our existing church, you'll begin to see the big equipment and then the steel going up and our new church will be being built this summer and fall and hopefully just about one year from now, we'll be in there giving it the final cleaning and ready to have services in the new building.
[time=998] So these are days of growth and expansion and we want to thank the Lord for the opportunity.
[time=1003] These are also unique days of expansion for our television ministry.
[time=1007] Just last Sunday, we began broadcasting for the first time on Channel 44 out of Laimo, Ohio and we want to welcome you Ohio friends to the Bible Hour today and thank you for joining us.
[time=1019] Also, many of you may be watching us and finding this a new program at seven in the morning here in Fort Wayne on Sundays.
[time=1026] We've been on at 11 o'clock but we've been moved to 7 a.m. and hope we're meeting many new friends today and want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1036] - Rick, I was in Marion last week and had the privilege of talking to several people that watch us on the Marion station down there and that's really a privilege.
[time=1046] Well, within the city of Marion and South Ben were on at the same times and looking forward to continuing to minister to you through our television ministry, the Bible Hour.
[time=1055] We have Bert Kettinger coming.
[time=1057] - Throughout the summer, we've been having our summer Bible conferences on Thursday night and invite those of you that don't have a regular church service to come with us.
[time=1064] We'd like to announce to you that Bert Kettinger's going to be with us on July 30th at 7 p.m.
[time=1069] right here in the Convocation Center.
[time=1071] He's a base baritone that is a fine singer, a fine Christian is often heard on our own radio stations here and is connected with the WMBI Moody Bible Institute radio station in Chicago.
[time=1084] He'll be a fine addition to our summer Bible conference and we're looking forward to having him here and I hope you can come and join us too.
[time=1091] - I wanna add to peak my invitation to join us every Thursday but particularly the 30th for Bert's concert.
[time=1098] We know you'll enjoy that but more than enjoy it, you'll be strengthened spiritually as you worship the Lord through music.
[time=1105] We offer a booklet almost every Sunday as a way of strengthening your faith.
[time=1111] The important thing is that you are getting into God's Word and then secondly that God's Word is getting into you.
[time=1118] That cannot happen through one hour a week of television ministry or one hour a week of actual attendance in church.
[time=1125] It's gotta be a regular habit in our life and so we make some fine Christian literature available to you free to encourage you to be in the Word.
[time=1134] This month we're offering the booklet Promises from Proverbs.
[time=1138] The reason why we've chosen this book is this month all of our messages will come from a study of the book of Proverbs and this booklet will just give you additional insight.
[time=1148] It's really a topical index so you could look up what does God's Word have to say about my emotions.
[time=1154] Simply look up the word emotions and there's the insight from Proverbs laid right in front of you.
[time=1159] Or you might look up success or health or anger or any number of topics and this will give you a quick index.
[time=1166] We'd love to send you a copy and we encourage you to write to us today and we'll mail it to you.
[time=1171] We have men's stock and they're waiting for your letter.
[time=1174] Simply write to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1185] Again, that is the Bible hour box 15,000
[time=1191] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1195] - Rick is, many of the people might know we have two services on Sunday morning for to accommodate the people that come to the Black Hawk Baptist Church and from time to time we congregate together down at the Grand Wayne and we have a grand celebration again this summer on August 2nd.
[time=1212] That's going to be a delightful day when we will all go down from this area of Fort Wayne to the Grand Wayne and fellowship together in our one worship service down there and that's always an exciting day to see all the people together.
[time=1225] - Oh, it really is.
[time=1226] And we also want to invite you friends who are part of the greater Fort Wayne area to plan on being a part of the Grand Wayne worship service at 10 o'clock August the 2nd.
[time=1237] Now we're going to return back to the live part of our morning worship service and trust that through the ministry of music that our guests are providing and our study of God's word that you'll come to a growing relationship with Christ.
[time=1249] (gentle music)
[time=1256] [MUSIC - 235 seconds]
[time=1498] (audience applauds)
[time=1510] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 233 seconds]
[time=1761] (audience applauds) - Thank you very much.
[time=1775] We certainly appreciate your ministry to us this morning.
[time=1778] This moment reminding us of the rock of life, Jesus Christ.
[time=1783] The cleft of the rock speaks of that crack in a rock where a person could literally hide from their enemy or take shelter from the elements.
[time=1794] God says, I am a rock, but there's a place of refuge within the rock if you'll come to me.
[time=1800] God, we would pray today that each eye would catch sight of that cleft today, that they would find a hiding place in you.
[time=1811] Many of us today, God, are here preoccupied with
[time=1817] in a phrase, the cares of this world.
[time=1820] Some are bound today by their own hearts.
[time=1826] With grief, they have suffered loss and is cut deeply,
[time=1832] and it's hard for them to think of another thought, except for the death of that loved one.
[time=1838] God be for that one, a point of refuge cleft in the rock.
[time=1846] Others today, God feel a sense of guilt even for being here and listening because they know they have compromised so often and so long.
[time=1858] God help them to see that they can be rebuilt on the rock.
[time=1865] God others today are so apathetic, they could not articulate to anyone else or to themselves why they are here.
[time=1875] They are simply here.
[time=1877] God, we ask you to awaken them and place them on top of the rock of Christ.
[time=1886] Others today are physically suffering.
[time=1890] We pray for their recovery.
[time=1892] We pray today for Bev Hebech and Dave Richards and others who have been in the hospital too long.
[time=1899] Your hand of recovery would be upon them.
[time=1902] Father, we pray today.
[time=1905] That our hearts would be opened before you and we invite you today to do surgery on our lives.
[time=1912] We invite you today to probe within us.
[time=1915] In fact, we not only invite you, we ask you today to search us and to reveal to us ourselves and create in us a new dimension of life
[time=1928] with freedom and power.
[time=1932] Help us to learn to retrace our steps and return to those points of spiritual departure and to walk with you afresh today.
[time=1945] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1949] The word recall is not a new word to us.
[time=1955] We're used to hearing that on the news often that a certain car is going through a recall and everybody who has certain model numbers and year numbers, please bring your car in for a check.
[time=1966] A number of years ago, a recall took place but it was not an automotive recall.
[time=1972] It was a rather unique recall that involved 487 people.
[time=1977] Their pacemakers were being recalled and all 487 of them were in service, not on the shelf.
[time=1985] They had to go back to the hospital, have their chest opened, and they had to have a new pacemaker put in.
[time=1994] Their hearts were on the recall.
[time=1996] In Proverbs chapter four, God puts our hearts on recall.
[time=2003] If you have a Bible today, I want to invite you to open it to Proverbs four.
[time=2008] This Old Testament book of the Bible penned by Solomon but drafted by God, given to Solomon for the purpose of giving to his sons and to his sons sons and to all of us today.
[time=2022] Timeless advice about managing our lives.
[time=2028] Proverbs chapter four, verse 20.
[time=2031] It's a passionate plea of a father to a son, probably not to a young son, but probably to a son who is now a full grown man, about to grab ahold of his life on his own.
[time=2045] Ready to start calling all of the shots and managing himself.
[time=2050] Here's what Solomon writes, an impassioned plea.
[time=2056] My son, pay attention to what I say.
[time=2060] Listen closely to my words.
[time=2063] Do not let them out of your sight and keep them within your heart.
[time=2070] For they are alive to all who find them and health to a man's whole body.
[time=2078] Above all else, guard your heart
[time=2085] for it is the wellspring of life.
[time=2088] Put away perversity from your mouth.
[time=2093] Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
[time=2096] Let your eyes look straight ahead.
[time=2102] Fix your gaze directly before you.
[time=2105] Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm.
[time=2113] Do not swerve to the right or to the left, but keep your foot from evil.
[time=2122] Managing our hearts.
[time=2126] The most important issue of life.
[time=2130] This is God's word.
[time=2133] He inspired it and it's far more important for us to note that it came from God than it came from Solomon.
[time=2139] But once you know that, it's often insightful to know who the human author was because God used that person's personality.
[time=2148] Solomon was, first of all, a man of great experience.
[time=2153] There was not anything that life could offer that Solomon had not only tasted, but he had indulged in.
[time=2162] You speak of the man who had had his hand in every pot, it was Solomon.
[time=2168] He knew what it was like to leave the life of the Epicurean, though he lived far before Epicurus.
[time=2174] He was of that philosophy for a chapter of his life.
[time=2178] He said, he drink and be married.
[time=2181] Well, you only go around once.
[time=2183] Go for it all.
[time=2185] But he went through a different chapter in his life where he became very ascetic and very obsessed with discipline.
[time=2191] He lived a very stoic life, very structured,
[time=2197] very work-conscious, very detail-oriented, very production-minded.
[time=2203] There's not only a man of varied experiences, he was a man of great success.
[time=2210] Solomon had accumulated so much personal wealth that contemporaries couldn't believe it, so they came to see it and they gazed in amazement and said, not only is what we heard true, but the half of it hasn't even been told yet.
[time=2224] He was a man of great success in leadership.
[time=2229] He was king, and in his day he was king above every other king.
[time=2235] Babylon to the north, nor Egypt to the south could begin to compare with the military might of Solomon.
[time=2243] He was the king.
[time=2245] In the book of Proverbs, he is written about such things
[time=2251] as controlling your temper.
[time=2253] The walk of a king, he's written about managing your finances and living in harmony with your wife.
[time=2261] He's covered almost everything that life could possibly bring forth, but today he says, this is above everything else.
[time=2275] More important than anything else, my son, this is more important.
[time=2281] Guard your heart.
[time=2284] Now by heart, he obviously didn't mean the physical organ that pumps blood and life throughout the body.
[time=2291] As important as that organ is, that's not his reference.
[time=2296] We Westerners in America take our lead from the Hebrews who referred to the heart as the inner person.
[time=2304] The Greeks didn't use the word heart nearly so often.
[time=2306] It's a little crude, but they used the word bowels.
[time=2309] We talk about asking Jesus Christ in your heart.
[time=2312] The Greeks talked about asking Jesus Christ into your bowels.
[time=2317] And in first John chapter two, verse 17, it says, anyone who sees a brethren need and shuts up his vowels of mercy, how does the love of God abide in him?
[time=2330] In Papua New Guinea, they don't talk about asking Jesus into their heart.
[time=2335] They think that the seat of life is the throat.
[time=2338] So they talk about asking Jesus to come into your throat.
[time=2341] All of those are good descriptions because you ever noticed that when something hurts you, you get a lump in your throat.
[time=2348] And it's as though that inner man for a moment is located in the throat or perhaps you've had the experience of what we really call a broken heart where right in your chest there is pain.
[time=2363] There is literal physical pain when nothing is physically wrong, your heart, not the organ, but right where the heart is begins to ache.
[time=2372] And the bowels, do you ever notice how that your stomach gets into knots because the inner man's in anxiety?
[time=2383] All of these are descriptions, trying to say there is something on the inside of you.
[time=2390] And Solomon called it a heart.
[time=2394] He said, "Above everything else, guard your heart." What is that heart or that throat or that inner you?
[time=2404] Number of things in the book of Proverbs attempt to describe it.
[time=2409] First of all, I'd like to say it's the master control center of you.
[time=2413] It is the seat of your life, sense of purpose.
[time=2418] Turn to Proverbs chapter 20 verse five and you'll see this.
[time=2422] Proverbs 20 verse five.
[time=2424] The purposes of a man's heart are deep waters,
[time=2434] but a man of understanding draws them out.
[time=2441] Your heart is that inner part where life's purposes are determined.
[time=2447] What makes you do the things you do?
[time=2450] What gives you the desires that you have?
[time=2452] And your seat of desire is another description of that master control center.
[time=2457] Your heart is those things that you want.
[time=2459] Proverbs 17, 16 brings that out.
[time=2463] It says, "What good is money in the hand of a fool since he has no desire?" That's actually the same word for heart since he has no desire for wisdom.
[time=2474] What is it that you want?
[time=2477] You desire comes from that inner master control center.
[time=2482] That dictates your life's purpose, your life's want.
[time=2486] It's what motivates you.
[time=2487] It's your master control center.
[time=2491] Secondly, your heart is, and I'm gonna call it the mysterious you.
[time=2497] Look at chapter 21, verse two.
[time=2499] Proverbs 21, two says, "A man's ways seem right to him, but the Lord weighs the heart." You know what that's saying?
[time=2510] That inside each one of us, there is this dimension we're today calling a heart that is so mysterious that we think we know why we're doing something, but we may not have it accurate.
[time=2524] And it's only God who can weigh the heart and know it's real motivation.
[time=2530] Let me give you an illustration of that.
[time=2533] Some of us, mostly men, but many women, struggle from a phenomenon that psychologists now call the workaholic.
[time=2542] It's the man or woman who can't quit thinking about the job.
[time=2547] It's the guy who's in the shower, and he says, "What if?" He wraps a towel around himself and goes and makes another phone call.
[time=2556] It's the man who wakes up in the middle of the night and the numbers are still in front of him, and he can read the balance sheet in his sleep.
[time=2564] It's the guy who goes to work earlier than everybody else and stays longer.
[time=2570] And the man who says, "The reason why I do that is because the job is important.
[time=2577] It has to be done, and it needs to be done right, and I'm committed." All of those things may be true, and those are the things that are motivating him so he thinks.
[time=2589] But far deeper in his heart, it may be that this man, though he appears to be all together, is suffering tremendously from a lack of felt significance and a lack of security.
[time=2605] And so he or she just keeps working and working and working, hoping someone will say, "You are important.
[time=2612] You are vital.
[time=2614] We couldn't live without you.
[time=2616] You are secure." And he or she may not even know that themselves because your heart is that mysterious you, that you're incapable of completely understanding and knowing.
[time=2631] That's why David said, "God, you search me
[time=2638] and know me.
[time=2640] You test me and try me and see if there's anything unclean within my heart." He said, "I can't do it myself.
[time=2651] I'm not able because our own hearts, Jeremiah the prophet said, are desperately wicked.
[time=2657] Who can know them?
[time=2658] I can't know your heart.
[time=2660] I can't even know my own heart.
[time=2662] Or can you know mine or your own?
[time=2665] It is the mysterious you." The third thing that this heart is in the book of Proverbs, it is the maskless you.
[time=2674] All of us wear a fair degree of masks.
[time=2680] We are able to put on a mask that says, "Hi, I'm happy." But on the inside, we are miserable.
[time=2691] We have the ability to put on a mask that says, "I really like you.
[time=2696] Glad you're here. Thanks for coming over.
[time=2698] Kathy and I have been looking forward to your coming." And for two days, we sat by the phone hoping that you would cancel.
[time=2705] Now those aren't my thoughts.
[time=2709] That's just, I'm just paraphrasing Proverbs 23-7.
[time=2714] It says, "Do not eat the food of a stingy man.
[time=2719] Do not crave his delicacies.
[time=2721] Free is the kind of man who is always thinking about the cost.
[time=2725] Can you believe how much they eat?
[time=2726] Eat and drink, he says to you.
[time=2730] But his heart is not with you.
[time=2733] The heart is that maskless you.
[time=2737] That part that we occasionally in a moment of transparency revealed to others, but most often camouflage to make it look just a little bit better than it is.
[time=2753] That inner you, that master control center, that mysterious you that is unsearchable, that maskless individual that is the true you, is so important to God.
[time=2770] We as Westerners are so conscious.
[time=2775] I mean, could you imagine how inappropriate you would have felt it to be had I come today in my new blue jams, not put jams, just those new jams that are so popular and a sleeveless t-shirt in my jogging shoes.
[time=2793] And I came in fresh from a three mile run.
[time=2796] Otociferous as it may be, here I stood.
[time=2800] You'd say he doesn't look like, he's not dressed right, doesn't smell right.
[time=2805] We wouldn't accept that.
[time=2811] Because we are absolutely preoccupied with the external.
[time=2815] I'm not for any of you coming after a fresh jog
[time=2822] without trotting through the shower.
[time=2824] But that is so incidental to what God says his value system is.
[time=2830] He said, I am so concerned about your heart, not your dress, but your heart.
[time=2839] Israel was looking for a king.
[time=2841] They chose a bad one by the name of Saul.
[time=2846] You know why they chose him?
[time=2848] Because outwardly he matched the descriptions.
[time=2851] Tall, rugged, handsome.
[time=2854] Dale, you like this?
[time=2855] He had red hair.
[time=2857] I mean, they liked him.
[time=2858] But his heart was far from God and he led them to defeat.
[time=2863] God chose another one, David.
[time=2865] David was just a young man.
[time=2868] He was really a boy.
[time=2869] God chose him.
[time=2870] He wasn't ready for battle, but he was ready spiritually.
[time=2875] Solomon says, guard your heart.
[time=2879] Let's talk about that word guard for just a moment.
[time=2882] You guard in two completely opposite different ways.
[time=2885] First of all, you guard when you're attempting to keep something in.
[time=2890] Some of you may have some valuable jewelry, are some documents that are very important and it's important that you keep them and that nobody else get to them and you're guarding them to keep them in a secure spot.
[time=2903] You may have a lock box, you may have a safe, but you want to keep those things in.
[time=2909] We have many police officers, sheriff's deputies in our church and it is their job to keep some people in.
[time=2917] Jail.
[time=2919] And so there are guards to keep them in.
[time=2924] At the same time, we guard something to keep things out.
[time=2929] We post a guard at the White House.
[time=2934] It's nice of guys I am.
[time=2937] I just can't walk up to the White House and say, "Hi, I'm Rick, tell Ron I'm here." Doesn't work like that.
[time=2944] As a matter of fact, it is the guard's job to keep people like me out so that the president can do presidential things.
[time=2954] We go to the hospital and there's a sign that says, quarantine, it is to keep us out
[time=2964] and to keep the virus or bacteria in.
[time=2970] God says to guard our hearts because there are some things that we must keep in and there's a completely different list of things we must keep out.
[time=2982] How do you guard your heart two ways according to this passage back in Proverbs chapter four?
[time=2988] The first way you guard your heart is by conforming it to the wisdom of God's word.
[time=2994] You've got to guard it to keep God's word in your heart and the phrasing is here poetic and insightful.
[time=3002] It says, "My son, pay attention to what I say.
[time=3006] "Listen closely to my words.
[time=3008] "Do not let them out of your sight "keep them within your heart "for they are life to all who find them "and health to a man's whole body." He wants him to keep God's word in.
[time=3022] It begins with a very passionate plea.
[time=3026] Those of us who are parents have a great desire for our children not to make the same mistakes that we made.
[time=3036] You know, as a young boy, I love the Westerns.
[time=3039] Any of you people who are 30 and 40 years old, you remember Saturday morning, you'd get up in the morning and it was nothing but Westerns from the time you got up to lunchtime.
[time=3049] I mean, there was sagebrush cinema, there was Roy Rogers with Gabby Hayes and there was the Lone Ranger and the Cisco Kid and Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson.
[time=3059] And for those of you who are modern cowboys out of the Western sky came, sky king.
[time=3064] And I just lived in front of that TV set.
[time=3067] You know what?
[time=3069] 'Cause I lived in front of that TV set.
[time=3071] I couldn't read.
[time=3073] Oh, I could sit there and I could make this word and then the next word and I'd read it to you and I wouldn't know what I said.
[time=3081] You know, I was in the sixth grade and I went to this church camp and they asked everybody to read a verse and I read, "If somebody hits you on the right creek, "turn to him your left creek." (audience laughs) You know what they did exactly what you did?
[time=3094] They laugh, I thought, I wonder what they're laughing at.
[time=3098] I just couldn't read.
[time=3100] Oh sure, I could say words but I didn't get them all right.
[time=3103] In order to this very day I have a difficulty reading.
[time=3106] I don't want that to happen to my kids.
[time=3110] Kathy's been taking them to the library and there's this program this summer and Rachel, a first grader has read so far this summer, 67 books.
[time=3121] Now they're not big books, world book and cyclopedia.
[time=3125] You know, some of those shorter works.
[time=3128] No, they're just these real little children's stories but you know what?
[time=3132] She's learning to read and that's important to me because I don't want her to spend two years in the third grade or to say turn to him your left creek and not know why people are laughing.
[time=3146] You know, Solomon said, "My son, I've aired greatly." Pay attention, listen to what I say.
[time=3155] Don't reproduce the same mistakes in life.
[time=3161] And here's what he says.
[time=3165] He said, "Keep God's word on the inside." First thing he says is this, "Do not let them out of your sight." It's written into the script of about every other police or detective show.
[time=3179] The good guy is chasing the bad guy.
[time=3182] The bad guy makes it out of the building, first jumps in a car and drives away.
[time=3185] The good guy comes out, he sees the bad guy getting away, he looks this way that way, sees the cab, jumps in the back and he says, "Follow that car, "don't let it out of your sight." And off they go.
[time=3195] Solomon was saying, "My son, follow this book, "don't let it out of your sight."
[time=3206] We must be often hearing God's word.
[time=3211] It is not enough that you came this morning.
[time=3216] In the morning services, we do teach God's word.
[time=3219] I trust that you sense that is vital.
[time=3221] The songs bring it forth and we give 30 minutes of teaching time, 10 minutes of which is one liners to wake you up, but that's not enough in a week.
[time=3231] You really need to be a part of an adult Bible fellowship or a home Bible study or both.
[time=3238] You really need to be studying God's word regularly.
[time=3241] You really need to come to the summer Bible conference on Thursday nights right in the middle of the week to be able to come and to be recharged in the spiritual insight of God's word.
[time=3253] Don't let it out of your sight.
[time=3256] And more than that, he says, "Not only don't let it out of your sight," then he said, "Keep them within your heart." He talked about memorizing God's word.
[time=3265] Regularly.
[time=3266] Do more than read it, do more than hear it, do more than study it, memorize passages.
[time=3271] What one should you memorize?
[time=3272] I don't know.
[time=3273] What are you struggling with in your life?
[time=3275] Struggling with lust, then memorize Job 31.1.
[time=3279] I have made a covenant with my eyes, not to lust.
[time=3283] Struggling with greed and covetousness, then memorize Hebrews 13.5.
[time=3288] Let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have.
[time=3295] Struggling this week with anger and memorize Proverbs 15.1.
[time=3299] A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.
[time=3304] Struggling with discipline in your life and memorize Matthew 16.24.
[time=3312] Whose server would come after me?
[time=3314] Let him deny himself.
[time=3315] Take up his cross and follow me.
[time=3319] David said, "Thy word have I hid in my heart." How much of God's word have you memorized this week?
[time=3325] This week, most of us none.
[time=3328] This month, most of us none, memorize it so you can conform your life to it.
[time=3336] The second thing he says about guarding your heart is not only conform it to God's word, but secondly, control what enters it.
[time=3347] You want to guard it to keep something in.
[time=3349] That's God's word.
[time=3350] And now you've got to guard it to keep some things out and he becomes very poetic, not that it necessarily rhymes, but in its imagery.
[time=3358] He starts off after he says, "Guard your heart." Verse 24, he says, "Put perversity away from your mouth." Guard your mouth.
[time=3368] Then he says, verse 25, "Let your eyes guard your eyes."
[time=3375] And then verse 26, make level paths for your feet.
[time=3379] Now what's he saying here?
[time=3381] First of all, he's saying in verse 24, guard your conversation.
[time=3385] What you say and what you hear.
[time=3389] Because you see, if you don't guard your conversation, you will take into your heart gossip, deception, bitterness, profanity, anger.
[time=3403] It will all come into your heart through conversation.
[time=3408] What your mouth says and what in turn is said back to you from the mouth of another.
[time=3413] Guard your conversations.
[time=3414] Second thing he says, guard your eyes.
[time=3418] He says, guard what you observe.
[time=3421] What enters in by way of observation.
[time=3424] Through the eyes comes the enticement of sexual compromise.
[time=3428] Through the eyes comes the insatiable appetite that I just want one more.
[time=3434] Comes covetous, greed, jealousy, envy.
[time=3437] I've got to have it.
[time=3438] We would laugh at the alcoholic who says, "I want to quit drinking and every night I go to the bar and ask my friends to help me not to drink." We turn around and say, "No, I don't want to be materialistic.
[time=3448] I'm just going to the mall to look around." I just thought I'd go look and see what the 88 models are looking like this year.
[time=3455] Guard your observation.
[time=3456] Feet speaks of experience.
[time=3459] I can't remember going anywhere that my feet didn't go with me.
[time=3463] Matter of fact, they not only went with me, they took me.
[time=3466] Remember that song, be careful little feet, where you go?
[time=3469] Be careful little feet, where you go?
[time=3472] Because your feet are that avenue of experience.
[time=3476] Romans 16, 19 says this.
[time=3480] Be wise concerning that which is good and be simple, which means inexperienced about evil.
[time=3487] Two great lies, Erwin Luther said, are the voice of Satan.
[time=3491] The first is, oh, it's alright to try it once, go ahead.
[time=3495] You've got to know what it's like.
[time=3496] You've got to experience it for yourself.
[time=3498] That is Satan's first lie.
[time=3501] Second lie is, we've done it once.
[time=3503] You might as well do it again.
[time=3505] Guard your heart by keeping God's word in it and controlling your experiences, your conversations,
[time=3516] and your observations to keep sin out of it.
