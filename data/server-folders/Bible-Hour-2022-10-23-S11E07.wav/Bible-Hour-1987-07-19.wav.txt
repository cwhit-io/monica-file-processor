[time=90] (bells ringing) Anger is an acid that does more damage
[time=119] than to the vessel in which it is stored than to the things on which it is poured.
[time=124] (dramatic orchestral music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hartz.
[time=139] We're glad you joined us.
[time=141] Rick Sermon today is entitled "Managing Our Anger." Anger, it can be a devastating enemy or a strong ally.
[time=149] We must control our anger or it will control us.
[time=153] How do you deal with your anger?
[time=154] Some of us blow up, releasing our anger without control or restraint.
[time=158] Usually when we blow up, we overreact to the situation thereby making it worse.
[time=163] Others of us don't blow up, we clam up.
[time=166] Instead of venting our anger, we hold it in.
[time=169] This will allow our anger to turn into resentment and bitterness.
[time=173] Today, we continue our series and proverbs on managing ourselves with a message entitled "Managing Our Anger." Please locate your Bibles that you are able to study along with us.
[time=185] Our special music includes a song from the sanctuary choir.
[time=188] (dramatic orchestral music) A solo from Kathy Hawks (dramatic orchestral music) and Brian Lozen.
[time=196] (dramatic orchestral music) The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=206] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=210] Now, here's Rick.
[time=213] - We have a met in this place today
[time=219] to sing how great thou art.
[time=221] Not just the words of that familiar song, but just the attitude of our heart to say, "God, you are a great God.
[time=228] We've come to worship Him today.
[time=230] We're delighted that each of you are here, that we can assemble in this place and lift up our voices together.
[time=237] We also wanna welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=241] And we trust that as we sing together and pray together and study God's word together, first of all, it will honor and glorify Him that we'll give to God the purest praise that we can give.
[time=253] And then secondly, that we will grow in our relationship with the Lord.
[time=258] Thank you for being a part of our service today.
[time=260] As we've come today to give and to sing the purest praise.
[time=265] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 148 seconds]
[time=431] He had put a new song in my heart, He even praise unto our God.
[time=435] What a privilege it is to sing praises unto the Lord, to thank Him for His glorious love and everlasting eternal salvation.
[time=444] We're gonna sing together Him number 187, a familiar song.
[time=448] We'll sing the first, second, third, and sixth stanzas together of amazing grace, 187.
[time=455] (gentle music)
[time=461] [MUSIC - 119 seconds]
[time=587] - I wanna be a great day when we can just sit around
[time=598] the throne and sing together and say, "Well, I think today I'll be a bass." And just be able to bellow out those great resonant low notes and at another time be a tenor and most of us would just like to be able to sing, I guess, but we'll all be singing great hymns of the faith up there celebrating our glorious time together with our Lord for eternity.
[time=622] The events of the week of the crucifixion had many emotions, began with great celebration as Christ wrote into the city.
[time=630] There was great contemplation as they assumed that he would be crucified toward the end of the week and then the sadness and the crucifixion and finally the glorious resurrection.
[time=643] The lamb of glory was slain for our sins.
[time=645] He took all of the sins of each one of us on himself.
[time=649] We're gonna listen to that story now as Kathy recreates it through this song.
[time=653] Let's listen carefully to this song and the ministry that Kathy has for us this morning.
[time=661] [MUSIC - 418 seconds]
[time=1082] - Hello and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=1098] It is such a privilege for us each day to share God's word with you and the ministry of music.
[time=1104] Today joining Pete and me is Jim Pearson, who's the director of our children's ministry here at Blackhawk.
[time=1109] Jim, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=1111] - Good morning, Rick, it's nice to be here.
[time=1113] - We're glad you're here and we wanted Jim to come today to tell a little bit about a special program we're having coming up and just the next day or two called Vacation Bible School.
[time=1122] What is Vacation Bible School and how is that planned?
[time=1126] - Well, Rick, we're planning Vacation Bible School this year for Blackhawk.
[time=1130] We haven't had it here for quite some time, several years, but we have a great program planned for them.
[time=1135] It's a chance for the children to come for about two and a half hours from nine o'clock in the morning till 11.30 a.m.
[time=1143] They can learn about the Bible, they can have Bible stories, singing, we've got some real great special events planned for them.
[time=1149] I think it's gonna be an exciting week and a very meaningful week for these children.
[time=1152] - You mentioned special things for the children.
[time=1155] What is special that they should look forward to?
[time=1157] - We have some people coming each day who are gonna add something above and beyond just the normal classroom activities.
[time=1165] We have a group of miniature ponies that are gonna come and the children are gonna get a chance to ride them and pet them and do certain things such as that.
[time=1172] We also have a Christian ventriloquist who will be here and he's gonna entertain the children one morning.
[time=1177] We have something like that planned each morning during our chapel portion of the program.
[time=1182] - Boy, that is really exciting.
[time=1183] Now, I have to tell you, I went to Vacation Bible School and I was little and Vacation Bible School and school, the only things that I really look forward to were the playtime and food.
[time=1195] How about that?
[time=1196] Have you got those plugged in?
[time=1197] - We definitely have those type of activities plugged in.
[time=1200] We have some ladies who have done a tremendous job.
[time=1202] We have some people here at church that have donated various things and some companies that have donated some products to us and we have some real wholesome, good refreshments for the children each day.
[time=1214] We also have a lot of people who have spent some time doing some very meaningful crafts for the kids.
[time=1218] It's gonna be something more than just popsicle sticks and a little bit of glue.
[time=1222] There's gonna be some really good crafts that children will be able to make and take home and save and I think it'll be meaningful to them for quite some time.
[time=1229] - Well, that's great.
[time=1230] And we wanted to share that special week for children so that those of you here in the Fort Wayne community who are looking for an opportunity for your children to grow spiritually would know about it.
[time=1240] Jim, what are the dates and the time for this year's Vacation Bible School?
[time=1244] - This year, Rick Vacation Bible School will begin on Monday the 27th of July.
[time=1250] The children will start at 9 a.m.
[time=1252] and it will run until 11 30 a.m. each morning.
[time=1254] It will run that entire week so it will finish on August 1st.
[time=1258] - So it goes Monday through Friday from 10 to 11 30.
[time=1261] - From 9 to 11.
[time=1262] - Oh, 9 to 11 30, thank you.
[time=1264] Well, if you have children who are of that age, we would love to have them be a part of our Vacation Bible School and want to encourage you to bring them here to Black Hawk beginning on Monday, July the 27th.
[time=1276] That week, we also have a special program for adults on Thursday night with a special music guest coming.
[time=1281] Rick, the Bible School who really sounds exciting and as we've told you from week to week, we've had our Summer Bible Conference on Thursday evenings.
[time=1289] We'd like to invite you to come this week on Thursday, July 30th to hear baritone bass singer, Bert Kettinger.
[time=1296] Bert is from the Chicago, Illinois area and he's been here before.
[time=1299] He has a great message in song, a beautiful voice.
[time=1303] And you'll want to come.
[time=1303] I hope you can set aside this Thursday evening at seven o'clock here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1309] We'll continue our Summer Bible Conference with special guest, singer, Bert Kettinger.
[time=1314] - Well, I'm certainly looking forward to the Vacation Bible School for the Children and Bert's coming for Kathy and myself.
[time=1320] And we want to include you and hope that you'll come and join us here at Black Hawk for those special events.
[time=1326] Today, we're going to be studying from the Book of Proverbs again.
[time=1329] And we're going to be talking about how to manage our anger.
[time=1333] Every one of us has anger.
[time=1335] It is not necessarily always a negative emotion, but quite often it becomes one.
[time=1341] And the Book of Proverbs gives us great insight into managing our anger.
[time=1345] And we have a booklet to share with you today to help you to have a better grip on God's word so that then you'll be prepared to get a better grip on your anger.
[time=1355] The booklet is entitled Promises from Proverbs.
[time=1358] And you can look up in a topical way, various topics including today's on anger.
[time=1364] We'd love to send you a copy of this as a gift from us to you if you'll simply write to us.
[time=1369] We want to send it to you today.
[time=1371] So please do write.
[time=1372] - As Rick mentioned, you can receive this book absolutely free by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1380] And the zip code is 46815.
[time=1384] Once again, the address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1392] - We do hope you'll write and request the booklet Promises from Proverbs.
[time=1397] And it would be a big help to us when you do write to let us know what station you watched the Bible Hour on.
[time=1404] We're now broadcasting in South Bend, Marion, Lima, and here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1409] And that information would be helpful.
[time=1411] So please give us the channel number or the call letters of your station when you do write.
[time=1416] Finally, today allow me to share with you we have a special worship service coming up on August the 2nd.
[time=1422] We'll be leaving our facility here at Blackhawk and heading into the heart of our city to the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1429] There we'll have a large worship service at 10 in the morning.
[time=1432] And we hope that many of you who are not able to come to Blackhawk but may live closer to town are looking for this special opportunity.
[time=1440] We'll join us August the 2nd at 10 in the morning for our worship service at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1446] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, we trust that you'll listen intently as our soloists sing of the truth of God's word and as we study together today on managing your anger.
[time=1459] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 81 seconds]
[time=1545] (gentle music)
[time=1568] [MUSIC - 80 seconds]
[time=1651] - Thank you, Brian.
[time=1665] Is the promise of Christ himself that he would give to those who believe in him eternal life.
[time=1672] And that death is not a termination but a beginning of a new life in heaven on his shore.
[time=1679] Precious promise to those of us who have lost loved ones in recent days.
[time=1684] I'd like to invite you to stand with me as we pray together this morning.
[time=1688] Would you stand and bow our hearts and our heads together as we look to the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1694] [MUSIC - 40 seconds]
[time=1738] - Lord Jesus, the eyes of our hearts are upon you.
[time=1748] We have come today to see you, Lord.
[time=1751] Not a choir sing a song or a soloist perform in their efforts.
[time=1758] Certainly not one such as I to speak but we have come to see you, Lord.
[time=1765] We have come to watch the Lamb.
[time=1767] God, it seems so inadequate for us to say that we love you and we thank you but God, our hearts ring forth that we do love you and we do want to say thank you for your unspeakable gift, your life for ours.
[time=1785] And we've come the day to cling to the reality of the resurrected Christ.
[time=1792] We ask that you would give us that rare blend of boldness and graciousness, that we would never be ashamed of you as we walk through the marketplaces of this community.
[time=1802] And with all boldness, we might declare that we know Christ.
[time=1805] Yet, Father, we pray that you would balance that boldness with graciousness, that we might be winsome and attractive, compelling people to you.
[time=1815] God, today, we've come to worship you.
[time=1821] And it's the prayer of our hearts today that you would accept the words of our mouth, the gift of our service today before your throne as we cast all glory to you.
[time=1837] Father, today we pray that your spirit would be alive in our hearts, transforming our lives.
[time=1845] We pray that radical Christianity would be rooted in us that we might see your spirit change the hearts of fathers, of mothers, of children.
[time=1858] You might heal damaged emotions, that you might change angry tempers, that you might soothe broken hearts, that Jesus Christ might be seen above all else.
[time=1872] For it is in His name that we pray, amen.
[time=1878] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1880] Without a doubt, He is going to be regarded in history
[time=1888] as one of the greatest football coaches of all times.
[time=1892] His winning record, his number of James in postseason bowls
[time=1898] is at the top of collegiate records.
[time=1901] Few have surpassed him.
[time=1905] But yet before he was ready to give up his coaching position at Ohio State University, what he has was forced to resign.
[time=1914] In a moment of desperate frustration, he took his fist and he attempted to slug an opposing football team player.
[time=1926] In days, the resignation was made public.
[time=1932] And the great coach no longer had a team.
[time=1936] More tragically, a lady was babysitting a child.
[time=1941] Her husband came home, the wife was tired.
[time=1946] The child had been screaming all day and was continuing to scream.
[time=1950] The husband is now irritated at this other child in the home causing such commotion.
[time=1957] Tempere began to boil.
[time=1961] The wife left to the grocery store for just a few moments.
[time=1964] The husband and frustration grabbed the child and shook it so violently that the child now is forever damaged, a quadriplegic.
[time=1978] That's not an isolated story.
[time=1982] Two businessmen enter into a partnership.
[time=1986] One sees the business ought to be handled in this way.
[time=1990] The other sees it just as clearly that the business should be handled in that way.
[time=1994] Best of friends are now locked together into a partnership of enmity.
[time=2001] One climbs up and the other blows up.
[time=2005] Counting his fist down on the desk, shattering the glass,
[time=2011] severing the nerves in his hands, also shattering the business.
[time=2019] And severing the relationship with a former friend.
[time=2022] Three very different vignettes.
[time=2027] Three very real scenarios of life.
[time=2030] All from the common source of uncontrolled anger.
[time=2036] Of all of the emotions, anger is the most mystical
[time=2042] and baffling.
[time=2043] Of all of the emotions, it is the most damaging.
[time=2047] Of all of the emotions, it is the most difficult to control.
[time=2052] And of all of the emotions, it is the one that I struggle with the most often.
[time=2056] If nobody else gets anything from our study today, thank you for the privilege of being in the library this past week, learning to help myself.
[time=2067] We're studying through Proverbs.
[time=2069] We looked last week at chapter four where it said, above everything else, guard your heart.
[time=2076] It became a reference point for lessons that Solomon would teach about managing your life.
[time=2081] And throughout the book of Proverbs, there are reoccurring themes like a thread of a tapestry that appears and then goes to the backside and reappears again and again.
[time=2091] Anger is one of those prominent themes that we are to manage.
[time=2096] So Solomon writes about managing our anger.
[time=2100] We're going to look this week at the high cost of anger, next week at the potential cures for anger.
[time=2107] But it's of surprise to many of us to learn that from a biblical standpoint that anger in and of itself is not necessarily sinful or wrong.
[time=2118] Most of the time we say anger, bad, wrong,
[time=2124] but the Bible does not teach that.
[time=2126] Much to our surprise, the Bible clearly teaches that there is a type or a level or a demonstration of anger that is not only acceptable but is appropriate.
[time=2138] I'll draw your attention to three different sites of that in the Bible.
[time=2143] First of all, back in Ephesians, chapter four and verse 26, Paul says the same thing that David said in Psalm four four.
[time=2155] It says this in the King James Bible, be angry.
[time=2160] And sin not.
[time=2161] The new international version puts it this way.
[time=2164] In your anger, do not sin.
[time=2168] Now what that verse is telling us is that there is a level of anger, there is a demonstration of anger that is appropriate and to be accepted.
[time=2179] But there's also the word of warning, don't allow that to turn to sin.
[time=2185] And the line between anger that is appropriate and anger that is inappropriate is a very narrow line indeed.
[time=2193] But there's a second reference from which we discover that anger is appropriate.
[time=2199] It's all of the references that refer to the character of God, he is holy, he is just, he is all together righteous.
[time=2210] And then we discover with all of those things being true
[time=2216] in Psalm seven, verse seven, it says this.
[time=2219] God is a righteous judge who expresses his wrath, his anger every day.
[time=2228] The God who you and I know is a loving God is also an angry God and he expresses that every day.
[time=2238] So obviously there's an anger that is appropriate.
[time=2243] And then one third sighting of an appropriate anger is the fact that Jesus Christ himself became angry.
[time=2251] I only found one time in the Bible where the word anger was used to describe Christ, but there are at least three illustrations beyond that where he was indeed angry.
[time=2261] First of all, in Mark chapter three, Jesus is about the heel man who is physically suffering.
[time=2269] Those watching come from a very narrow constricted religious view and they were far more concerned about is Jesus gonna heal on Sunday?
[time=2279] Because they had determined that the Sabbath special
[time=2285] couldn't work and to heal somebody was work.
[time=2288] The Bible says that Jesus became angry with them
[time=2295] and distressed in his own heart at their stubbornness.
[time=2299] Christ was angry.
[time=2301] Though the word is not used, it is certainly described in two other occasions where Jesus, we call it cleansing the temple.
[time=2309] In the religious structure of the day, it was mandatory for people to come to the temple and there to offer a sacrifice.
[time=2319] That was no small challenge because as Kathy told in the song, they would bring a sacrificial animal with them, but it could be rejected at the temple of not being pure or spotless enough.
[time=2332] And one way you could be assured that your animal would be accepted would be to buy your animal at the temple at a more than reasonable markup.
[time=2342] And there were those that had turned the temple into a lucrative cash revenue by selling these animals.
[time=2353] That made Jesus angry.
[time=2356] And not only were there those who were selling the animals that when you came to the temple, you couldn't use your regular money.
[time=2364] You had to have temple money.
[time=2366] How many of you have traveled internationally and if you go to Japan, you can't reach in your bill for a pull out $2 and buy something, you have to have those dollars converted into Japanese currency called yen.
[time=2378] Or if you go to Mexico, you have to have pesos.
[time=2380] And there are people who will gladly convert your dollars into yen or pesos, gladly for a profit.
[time=2388] And there were money changers in the temple that as you came with your currency, they would take your money converted into temple money for a profit, then you could take your temple money over here and you could buy your animal for another profit.
[time=2403] Jesus saw that.
[time=2409] He said, "You have turned my father's house into a den of thieves." And then the Bible says that he braided himself together a whip and he drove them out.
[time=2422] That word drive is the same word that speaks of a wind driving a ship.
[time=2427] Or for those of you who like me grew up watching rawhide, the cowboy who drives the cattle.
[time=2434] Jesus forcibly removed them from the temple.
[time=2438] He made that whip and he drove out the animals and when he came to the tables of the money changers, he flipped them over.
[time=2445] He was angry.
[time=2447] He did that very early in his public ministry and he did it again three years later in the week prior to his crucifixion.
[time=2456] He was angry.
[time=2458] During that same time frame, he had a confrontation with the religious leaders of the day.
[time=2466] We call them Pharisees, that was their religious political identification.
[time=2470] And Jesus spoke to them like this.
[time=2473] He said, "Woe unto you." Scribes, that fit, they were scribes, they wrote it down, hypocrites.
[time=2486] Think of that, somebody pointing a finger right at you and saying, "Woe," which means judgment's gonna come upon you because you are a hypocrite.
[time=2496] Now, if that didn't get his attention, he says, and this is pretty accurate.
[time=2501] He says, "You stink like an open tomb." And then he did say, "You snakes, you vipers."
[time=2511] He was angry.
[time=2516] You see, there is a God-given emotion
[time=2522] that all of us have called anger, which can potentially be used right and it can potentially be used wrong.
[time=2533] And the Bible says, "Be angry and sin not." Hawks' definition of anger, this is not inspired, it is just opinion, but anger is an emotion that can be used with control and purpose
[time=2552] or it is emotion that can be released without control and without restraint.
[time=2560] Jesus used his anger with control and purpose.
[time=2567] He was in complete control of himself, in complete control of his words, and he said, "This is wrong and it is my position "as the Son of God and as the Messiah "to correct this situation and with complete purpose "in control," he did just that.
[time=2583] Anger is an emotion that we can have
[time=2590] one of two problems with.
[time=2592] The lesser or the least frequent is not enough anger.
[time=2596] You see, there are things in life that should make us angry.
[time=2600] It's a natural human instinct that we become angry when there is a threat of pain or actual pain.
[time=2608] Our body triggers in a self-defense mechanism.
[time=2612] Anger is a part of that.
[time=2613] It is simply your body preparing itself for action.
[time=2619] And there are situations in life that should make us angry.
[time=2625] And the absence of that anger is nothing less than cold apathy.
[time=2630] That's why Shafer is right to draft a book and to title it, "A Time for Anger." There is something wrong with a society that says, "It is okay for us to kill millions "of unborn children each year.
[time=2644] "If that's what the majority of people want, it's okay." That would make us angry.
[time=2650] And to not be angry is to be apathetic.
[time=2657] But the greater problem, the more frequent problem we have with anger is not an absence of anger.
[time=2663] It is an excessive anger.
[time=2666] It is when we were angry too often, are too extremely, are too inappropriately.
[time=2673] There are a number of good tests to see if you fit into this category.
[time=2680] Let me just ask you a few questions that you can answer only to yourselves, only on yourself, not on your spouse.
[time=2687] One, are you frequently aggravated
[time=2695] over minor irritations?
[time=2697] Are you frequently aggravated
[time=2704] over what most of your friends or relatives consider a fairly minor situation?
[time=2709] Then you're struggling with an angry temperment.
[time=2715] Secondly, do you use anger as a tool to manipulate others?
[time=2725] Into doing what you want by either climbing up or blowing up?
[time=2731] You see, many of us use anger when we're not getting our way, we are able to show the coming signs of an explosion.
[time=2741] The people around us notice the earth tremors, which indicate a earthquake is on its way.
[time=2749] Are they see the top of the volcano starting to move and they know an eruption is due?
[time=2755] And when they see those tall tail signs, they quickly say, oh, let's do it your way because they don't want the explosion.
[time=2763] And you blow up and they know you blow up and so you threaten to them you're gonna blow up and you get your way.
[time=2771] Others of us are far too spiritual, we would never think of blowing up.
[time=2777] We clam up.
[time=2780] We don't explode.
[time=2784] We don't say the wrong thing.
[time=2785] As a matter of fact, we say nothing.
[time=2788] We give them the cold silent treatment.
[time=2792] I can go forever looking at you, living with you, living around you and not acknowledging you.
[time=2800] I can withhold not only my words, but my love and my affection.
[time=2807] And I can without saying anything or doing anything that could be labeled inappropriate, make your life miserable.
[time=2816] And if I do not get my way,
[time=2822] I will retreat and clam up until I get my way.
[time=2827] That is called passive hostility.
[time=2834] And some of us have mastered it to a fine art.
[time=2840] Do you blow up our clam up as a way of manipulating others into giving you your way?
[time=2848] Third test is very similar to what we're talking about.
[time=2851] Do you find yourself occasionally blowing up and not planning on it?
[time=2855] Life literally got out of control.
[time=2858] You didn't mean to do it, but suddenly you have exploded.
[time=2862] And now you're left with the pieces and near futile attempt to put them back together with words of apology.
[time=2872] If any of those things are true,
[time=2878] then you're struggling with anger as a problem of your temperament.
[time=2883] I am struggling.
[time=2885] I am pushing my own buttons today.
[time=2889] Let's talk just a moment about an angry temperament.
[time=2895] We're all gonna get angry and we're all gonna blow up some time.
[time=2899] That does not therefore mean that we have an angry temperament.
[time=2903] But how is an angry temperament developed?
[time=2907] Well, there are short-term causes and there are long-term causes.
[time=2912] There are things that on the short-term, more or less, trigger our anger.
[time=2916] You've seen the old aspirin commercial.
[time=2918] Mom is just smiling away and she's waxing the floor and she hangs it up and she walks over and here come a herd of yard apes.
[time=2926] Fresh in from the mud and they track it across her floor and wham in the back of her neck, the tension mounts and the angry words come out and then they say, you need to.
[time=2938] As though that is going to suddenly make these yard apes
[time=2945] civilized and clean the floor automatically.
[time=2949] Frustration triggers that anger, stress does.
[time=2953] I mean, when you've gone to work and you have heard people gripe all day and the fact that the stock market went down two points is your fault personally and you come home and you're greeted by more of that.
[time=2968] You explode and say, I can't handle it.
[time=2972] Stress causes that.
[time=2974] Fear causes that.
[time=2979] Fear often causes us to be angry.
[time=2982] I have a close friend.
[time=2984] This friend is seldom angry under the most stressful circumstances, never angry.
[time=2989] Under the most aggravating circumstances rarely loses the cool but when frightened, somebody in a game like spirit
[time=2999] sneaks up and says boo, suddenly becomes the bionic woman.
[time=3004] Ah, fear will trigger that or the threat of fear.
[time=3010] All of those are things that trigger it but why does it last or happen so often in some of us?
[time=3017] Those are the deeper issues and there are two things that cause it.
[time=3022] First of all, turn to Proverbs chapter 22 and verse 24.
[time=3027] It says, do not make friends with a hot tempered man.
[time=3040] Do not associate with one easily angered.
[time=3045] Why?
[time=3046] Verse 25.
[time=3048] Or you may learn his ways and get yourself ensnared.
[time=3052] The first way we learn anger as a manifest temper is by modeling.
[time=3062] Modeling is simply a common word that describes that we learn behavior by copying the behavior of another.
[time=3070] Here Proverbs wisely says, choose very carefully
[time=3076] who your friends are, who you choose to model your life after because you will probably become like them.
[time=3082] It is well documented that most people who are obsessively aggressive, who abuse others either physically or verbally, were physically or verbally abused as a child and they copied that behavior.
[time=3096] It was modeled to them, father to child.
[time=3099] One of the things that's really concerning is that we as adolescents and as adults consciously choose some very negative role models as it relates to anger.
[time=3113] I'm thinking particularly of the films that are so popular today.
[time=3117] Violence is the solution to the problems.
[time=3122] Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Terminator, Rambo.
[time=3127] And we look at these people's heroes.
[time=3130] I want to admit that the Lone Ranger was one of my childhood heroes and I don't want to completely excuse everything the Lone Ranger did, but in 10 years he never shot anybody.
[time=3140] He only shot the gun out of their hand.
[time=3142] In contrast to that, Rambo shows up with a machine gun and molds people down.
[time=3149] And we sit there saying, that's good.
[time=3152] I like that.
[time=3154] I don't like my teachers.
[time=3155] And I think I'm going to call Rambo.
[time=3158] And we copy that and we say those are the heroes and we model that behavior.
[time=3164] Most of you know I like sports and my favorite is football.
[time=3169] And it is a good game, but often give them to excessive violence.
[time=3173] And many a coach knows that the best way to win a game is to get your players angry because that is going to make that adrenaline move and surge.
[time=3183] And the athlete learns that he wins in the game
[time=3190] by being angry and he transfers that to the game of life and says, I'll win again if I just get angry.
[time=3196] Many of us have chosen the wrong role models
[time=3202] and need to today start choosing the new ones because it is modeled and it is learned through modeling.
[time=3210] The second thing that makes for an angry temperament is not only modeling, but it's reinforcement.
[time=3218] Look at chapter 19 and verse 19.
[time=3221] It says, a hot tempered man must pay the penalty.
[time=3227] If you rescue him, you will have to do it again.
[time=3235] Now let me explain this to you by creating a situation.
[time=3239] Here's a man, he is hot tempered.
[time=3241] He blows up and he loses his cool.
[time=3244] One of two things will happen.
[time=3246] One, he will have to face the consequences of his anger.
[time=3252] He'll have to make apology and make restitution and he will say, hmm, doesn't pay to get angry.
[time=3259] Or the other thing that will happen, he'll blow up, he'll lose his cool and everybody around him will say, uh-oh, we give in, you can have your way and we'll help clean up this mess that you made in your anger.
[time=3273] We will rescue you because you are so unhappy.
[time=3276] And if you rescue him, guess what?
[time=3280] He'll say, consciously or unconsciously, this really works.
[time=3285] I mean, I wasn't getting my way and all I had to do was kick the cat, yell at the dog and raise my hands with the kids and suddenly life got better.
[time=3294] I'll try that next time.
[time=3298] It's a learned behavior that comes from modeling and then it's reinforced because people allow us to get away with it by rescuing us and giving into that behavior.
[time=3311] That develops an angry temperament.
[time=3314] It is dangerous.
[time=3316] There are several biblical illustrations of this.
[time=3320] For conservation of time, I'll only tell them to you rather than trace you through these.
[time=3326] In Genesis chapter four, you've got a son named Cain, another one named Abel, they come, they make their sacrifices, Abel's is accepted, Cain's is not, he's jealous and he is angry, the Bible says, in his face is downcast.
[time=3342] God says, the opportunity is there for you to do right and if you don't do right, sin is crouched at the door like a leopard ready to spring on its prey.
[time=3354] Cain does not heed the warning, he persists in his anger, he goes into a field with his brother and he kills him.
[time=3360] Anger.
[time=3363] Moses was a man given to reoccurring cycles of anger.
[time=3367] He saw an Egyptian mistreating in Israelite, he went into the middle of it and he got so angry he killed the Egyptian.
[time=3373] At another point in his life, he's angry at the children of Israel, he says, God, what are we gonna do for water?
[time=3378] God says, speak to the rock.
[time=3380] So Moses walks over with his stick and he waxed the rock because he's angry.
[time=3385] Another point in his life, he goes up in the mountains, God gives him the Ten Commandments, he comes walking down the mountains, he sees that the children of Israel and his absence are worshiping false idols and he takes the Ten Commandments.
[time=3395] He's angry, it is a cycle of life.
[time=3404] There's another man who was angry in the scriptures.
[time=3409] Peter, they're coming to get Christ.
[time=3413] He impossibly grabs the swords of one of the attackers and he wields it and he strikes off Malchus's ear.
[time=3419] Angry.
[time=3421] Saul was jealous of David.
[time=3424] There was a hit song on the radio, it went like this.
[time=3427] Saul's slainous thousands, do what, do what, do what?
[time=3431] But David is 10,000, do what, do what, do what?
[time=3435] And that triggered the jealousy of Saul to the point where he set out to kill David.
[time=3439] David proved as a loyalty and Saul repents.
[time=3444] Saul gets angry the next time he hears that song and he gets angry and he masses together an army to go kill David.
[time=3452] He becomes angry with his own son, Jonathan, for helping David that they exchange hostile words and Saul in rage grabs a spear and throws it and nearly kills his own son.
[time=3469] Anger.
[time=3470] We will either learn to control our anger
[time=3476] or we will live with the consequences of our anger controlling us.
[time=3483] You see, anger is an acid that does more damage to the vessel in which it is stored
[time=3492] than to anything else on which it is poured.
[time=3496] We must master our anger.
[time=3525] We're coming to the close of another Bible Hour program.
