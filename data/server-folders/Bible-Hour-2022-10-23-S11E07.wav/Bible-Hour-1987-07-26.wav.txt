[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] - Usually there's no one more angry than the individual who knows that he's wrong.
[time=103] Remember two things.
[time=106] First, if you're right, you can afford to keep your temper.
[time=111] And if you're wrong, you cannot afford to lose it.
[time=115] And secondly, remember, people who fly off the handle usually make a bad landing.
[time=122] [MUSIC]
[time=135] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=140] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=142] Rick's message today is the second in a series entitled "Managing Our Anger."
[time=148] Often our anger does more damage than the original issue which caused it.
[time=153] The situation is damaged as well as our relationship.
[time=157] Today as we study Proverbs, we will note several principles for controlling our anger.
[time=164] Quite often our health is also the chronic victim of our seething anger.
[time=168] Today as we study Proverbs, we will note several practical principles for controlling our anger.
[time=175] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=180] We will be hearing special music from our sanctuary choir,
[time=186] as well as a piano solo from Brian Zook, and a solo from Denise Mitchell.
[time=195] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=204] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=208] And since my soul, my Savior God to me, I'll pray that Lord, I'll pray that Lord.
[time=239] Thank you, maybe seated.
[time=243] It is a delight to welcome you this morning to our worship service.
[time=248] We so appreciate you coming and worshiping with us.
[time=251] Earlier this morning, we heard that thunder when we were in here recording.
[time=255] We said, "Well, every time it thunders, we lose about 250 people." Then came the flood, and we wondered if there would be any people here, but it stopped and you came.
[time=264] We're delighted that you're here.
[time=266] Thank you for worshiping with us.
[time=268] We want to thank Ron Hackett for filling in for Pete as he's on vacation, visiting his daughter, and then his father on the west coast.
[time=275] But we've come today and our choirs prepared to lead us in an anthem of praise.
[time=279] It's titled, "It is well with my soul." It's a song that speaks of a confidence and a sustaining power that God can give on the inside when there are storms on the outside.
[time=293] When peace like a river attended my way, or when sorrows like C. Billow's role, whatever my lot now has taught me to say,
[time=303] "It is well. It is well with my soul."
[time=323] When sorrows like C. Billow's role, whatever my lot now has taught me to say,
[time=351] "It is well with my soul."
[time=387] My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=398] My sin, not in part, but the whole is near to the cross.
[time=412] And I buried the war, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul.
[time=429] It is well with my soul.
[time=441] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=453] And Lord, praise the day when my face shall be sighed.
[time=465] And our bloods be heard back as a song.
[time=491] It is well with my soul.
[time=556] Thank you, Lisa, and choir for that special number.
[time=559] Turn in your hymn's books now to number 51, "Blessed Assurance Jesus is Mine." Oh, what a foretaste because it is well with our souls.
[time=568] Some we're going to see Him face to face, and then it will be glory divine.
[time=573] Number 51 in your hymnals.
[time=584] On the first dance, everybody.
[time=614] Oh, this is my story, this is my song.
[time=623] Praising my sing, you're all we know.
[time=629] For it's a vision, perfect divine.
[time=634] This is my story, this is my song.
[time=647] Praising my sing, you're all we know.
[time=660] This is my story, this is my song.
[time=665] Praising my sing, you're all we know.
[time=672] For it's a vision, perfect divine.
[time=693] This is my story, this is my song.
[time=698] Praising my sing, you're all we know.
[time=703] This is my story, this is my song.
[time=709] Praising my sing, you're all we know.
[time=717] I appreciate your fine singing this morning.
[time=719] What a great job you're doing.
[time=722] We at Black Hawk are grateful for our young people, for their willingness to serve, and for the talents that God has given them, and for their willingness to use them.
[time=730] This morning, we are favored with a special on the keyboard by Brian Zuck.
[time=735] I know you're going to be blessed, and your heart's going to be touched as he plays for us.
[time=739] Joyful, joyful, we adore thee.
[time=741] Brian?
[time=760] [MUSIC - 91 seconds]
[time=871] [MUSIC] Like peering through a window blurred with rain [MUSIC] Emotions run together in a flood of doubt and pain [MUSIC] We prayed as best we could [MUSIC] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] And even though it seems impossible to me [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] But if he chooses not to move in the way we pray [MUSIC] Confident he is working all together for my good [MUSIC] I will stand behind his word, for he is able [MUSIC]
[time=1263] [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=1399] â™ª
[time=1405] Thank you Denise, a song of confident expression today that God is able.
[time=1413] Let's look to him in prayer.
[time=1416] God, many of us today can come and look back even on events of this week and see that you are indeed able.
[time=1424] We've seen your hand in our life, we felt your spirit as it's moved within us.
[time=1430] We've sensed the power of your word.
[time=1433] Yet God others today are facing frustrations in life and doubt looms high.
[time=1441] And they're not certain that you are able.
[time=1446] God, we ask you to show yourself powerful on their behalf.
[time=1451] That you would either in a mighty way alter their circumstances that they see that God is not only able but that he is acted.
[time=1459] Or that you would in their life God in the ministry of your spirit give them an inner peace that you are able.
[time=1467] But you have chosen to allow this storm and give them peace in the midst of it that they might sing.
[time=1476] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=1482] God, some of us have had things happen in the last day that have angered us, some within the last few moments.
[time=1491] Help us to cleanse ourself and even today learn how to deal with our anger.
[time=1498] Father, today we pray that your enabling hand would be upon lives who desperately need that.
[time=1506] We pray particularly for Ileana Lots as she has faced yet another amputation and faces even more possible surgery.
[time=1515] Oh God, we ask you to strengthen her.
[time=1518] We ask you today to give strength and courage to Bill and Eleanor Lehman as she faces surgery this week for cancer.
[time=1528] We pray that you would give peace to the heart of Cecil Lawson as tomorrow he buries his father.
[time=1536] We ask your hand to be upon the father of Lon Keaton as he faces a second open heart surgery that you might raise him up to fullness of health and of life.
[time=1549] Father, today each of us face those giants and we ask you to show yourself able and strong in our behalf.
[time=1560] Particularly today as we face the giant of anger, give us insight from your word.
[time=1567] Change us from what we are to being like Christ.
[time=1573] For it's in his name that we pray, amen.
[time=1579] Anger, how do you deal with it?
[time=1584] Why you?
[time=1590] Do you clam up and walk away?
[time=1595] Are you the more the type that when you're angry you've got to get it out and you're going to deal with it now, buddy?
[time=1602] You blow up.
[time=1605] Are you the type that says, I don't have any problems with anger.
[time=1610] You're the guy with the problems, not me.
[time=1614] I don't deal with anger.
[time=1617] All of us have anger and there are basically only four ways to deal with it.
[time=1624] We can clam up.
[time=1626] That means to internalize it, perhaps let it show in the color of our ears, the flaring of our nostrils, but no words come out.
[time=1638] Second way is to blow up, let it all fly, let the pieces fall where they made.
[time=1644] Create a few more pieces, let it out, blowing up the second way.
[time=1650] A third way is to deny it.
[time=1653] Refused admit that we have any anger or any problem in how we deal with our anger.
[time=1658] The fourth is to deal with it healthily and appropriately.
[time=1664] Today we're studying in a second lesson on dealing with your anger and we will come from the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1670] So if you have a Bible today we invite you to not slam it on the chair next to you, but to open it.
[time=1677] Find the Book of Proverbs about halfway through the Old Testament just after the major Book of Psalms.
[time=1684] We're going to move through several of these Proverbs and today in more of a teaching session than a preaching session.
[time=1691] I would like to teach us the inclusive pronoun, including me, teach us ten principles on dealing with our anger.
[time=1703] Principle number one is this, realize that you are angry and admit it.
[time=1714] One of the great temptations all of us have is the temptation to deny that we're wrong.
[time=1723] We find that so difficult to admit our shortcomings and our problems.
[time=1728] Many of you will remember the decade of the 70s, one of the most popular television shows, was the situation comedy called Happy Days.
[time=1737] A loveable little opitaler grown up and then a greaseball guy who was equally likable named Arthur Franz Arelli shortened the fawns.
[time=1748] About every four or five episodes they would work into the plot that the fawns had made a mistake, usually a major mistake,
[time=1757] and he spent the whole show denying that it was his fault or that he was possibly wrong.
[time=1762] And then the writers of the script would put in his mouth and attempt to say, "I was... are you trying to say I was..."
[time=1772] And he couldn't get the words out, "I was wrong." You know what they were doing? It's called a caricature.
[time=1780] It's when you take something that is real and you exaggerate it beyond reality for the point of emphasis.
[time=1788] Whoever wrote that show had a good insight into human character because all of us have a tremendous self-defense mechanism
[time=1798] that wants to deny that we're wrong and we find it so difficult to say and say it was sincerity, "I was wrong."
[time=1807] And no real change ever comes in our behavior or in our attitudes until we first realize we have a problem.
[time=1817] And if we're ever going to deal with anger in an appropriate way, we have to realize that we are struggling with that problem.
[time=1825] That's true no matter what. There's no joke told at the expense of psychologists and counselors.
[time=1831] Do you know how many psychologists it takes or pastors, whoever you want to pick on?
[time=1835] But you know how many psychologists it takes to change a light bulb?
[time=1840] Just one. But the bulb has to want to change.
[time=1846] That's really true about every psychological problem in our life.
[time=1851] Nothing will ever change until we realize there's a problem and we want to change.
[time=1858] Here's a related joke that has nothing to do with today's message. Nothing.
[time=1863] Do you know how many Michigan football players it takes to change a light bulb?
[time=1868] Just one, but he gets four hours credit for it this semester.
[time=1875] My eye caught a Michigan graduate here in the auditorium and I just felt a leading to share that.
[time=1884] Trying to see if he'll react with anger and I could help him through the problem.
[time=1889] Principle number one, we've got to realize that we're angry.
[time=1893] Now in 1 John chapter 1 verse 9, there's a very general but true antidote for sin in our lives.
[time=1901] It says if we confess, key word, confess our sins, God is faithful and he's just,
[time=1909] he'll forgive all of our sins and cleanse us from unrighteousness.
[time=1913] Now we've grown up watching so many detective shows that we think confess means when you walk into the precinct house and say I'm the guy that did it and the police said you would have never guessed it.
[time=1925] It's a good thing you confessed.
[time=1928] That's not what the biblical word confess means.
[time=1931] God's not up and haven't gone.
[time=1933] I know one of those turkeys down. Blackhawk was angry.
[time=1935] I just don't know who it is and I'm going to find out.
[time=1938] God knows.
[time=1941] Well what does confess mean?
[time=1943] Well, it's a compound of two words whether you look at the Greek word or the English word.
[time=1949] The English word con means with.
[time=1953] Pharaoh means to bear with.
[time=1956] To confess something means to bear with somebody else's opinion.
[time=1962] Namely, God's.
[time=1965] Here's what happens. We're angry and we want to justify it.
[time=1970] Well the only reason I got upset is because and we justify it.
[time=1977] There's some reason and we're now saying it's right for me to explode or to climb up.
[time=1983] Another thing that we often do is we don't justify it.
[time=1987] We minimize it. Well, it's not that big a deal.
[time=1989] Everybody else does it. I do it. You do it. So what?
[time=1992] We minimize it.
[time=1994] Third thing that we do is instead of confessing it is we blame it.
[time=1998] Hey, I only did that because of what you did to me.
[time=2002] You started it. When God says don't justify it.
[time=2007] Don't minimize it. Don't blame it.
[time=2009] Come to me and admit that you're struggling with sin in your life in this particular case.
[time=2016] Anger. We must recognize our anger.
[time=2022] Principle number two is we must recognize what causes our anger.
[time=2027] Throughout the book of Proverbs there are a variety of things that it indicates that cause anger. For example chapter 27 verse 4.
[time=2037] It says anger is cruel and fury which is anger that's escalated is overwhelming.
[time=2048] But who can stand before jealousy?
[time=2052] Jealousy is that root cause that often brings about anger and fury.
[time=2059] Jealousy is that situation where we are threatened and insecure.
[time=2067] Jealousy, low self-esteem, insecurity are all very often causes for anger.
[time=2076] There's another cause for anger in the Bible. It's the bad role models.
[time=2083] We talked about that last week where it says in Proverbs chapter 22 and verse 24, don't make friends with an angry man because you will learn to deal with your problems like he does.
[time=2097] We talked last week and I'll just mention in passing that we watched the individual on TV
[time=2103] who deals with his anger by releasing it aggressively and hostilely like Rambo or Schwarzenegger,
[time=2109] the Terminator, and we say that's how to deal with anger.
[time=2114] Bad role models, maybe it wasn't who you saw on TV, maybe it's who raised you, your mother or your father.
[time=2122] We learned that. There's another thing that often fuels our anger.
[time=2127] It's found in Proverbs 23 verse 29.
[time=2132] Starts with a series of questions who has woe, who has sorrow, who has strife, who has complaints,
[time=2146] who has needless bruises, who has bloodshot eyes, those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.
[time=2160] Often anger is fueled by alcohol.
[time=2166] Alcohol affects our inhibitions. That's our conscious sense of self-restraint.
[time=2174] Our inhibitions say don't do that, you'll make a fool of yourself.
[time=2179] Don't do this, you'll regret it later. Alcohol says don't worry about it, do whatever you want to do.
[time=2186] It affects those inhibitions and then we just let our tempers fly.
[time=2194] There are other things that cause anger.
[time=2197] What is it that usually causes you to be angry?
[time=2204] Recognize what that is. A third principle.
[time=2208] Though this may logically come last, I would like to share it now.
[time=2213] Repair damaged relationships.
[time=2223] Proverbs tells us in chapter 19 verse 19,
[time=2232] "A hot tempered man must pay the penalty.
[time=2237] If you rescue him, you will have to do it again and again."
[time=2244] And then chapter 21 verse 14 says, "A gift given in secret soothes anger." Let me bring those two verses together and show you how I came with the principle, repair damaged relationships.
[time=2259] When we get angry and we just let it out, we damage our relationship with other people.
[time=2265] Our next instinct is to back away and get away from it and ignore that person and live our life around them because we know we've hurt them.
[time=2276] But the Bible tells us that an individual who has caused problems by their anger
[time=2282] should be forced to come face to face with it.
[time=2285] And I think there are two reasons.
[time=2287] First of all, they need to be reconciled to that person.
[time=2292] Restitution needs to be made. Apologies and confession need to be verbalized.
[time=2298] And according to chapter 21 verse 14, a gift flowers men usually goes over real well.
[time=2307] We need to be restored to that person.
[time=2310] And secondly, it has this benefit.
[time=2314] Once we've gone through the humbling experience of repairing the damage of our anger,
[time=2321] that is etched on our minds and becomes a powerful motivation not to let it happen again.
[time=2329] But if I'm allowed to get angry and get away with it and I don't repair the relationship, then the next time I have the urge, I'll let it fly again.
[time=2336] But if I get angry and I damage a relationship and I have to go back and repair that, that's going to help keep this tongue in check and this temper under control.
[time=2350] The fourth principle may be the most critical regard petty disagreements as petty.
[time=2364] Proverbs 1911 to begin with.
[time=2371] A man's wisdom gives him patience and it is to his glory to overlook an offense.
[time=2385] Chapter 17 verse 14.
[time=2389] Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam.
[time=2394] So drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.
[time=2400] Many of us who struggle with our temper struggle with our temper because we lack discernment.
[time=2406] We're not able to discern on a scale of one to ten, which is a one, which is a ten.
[time=2413] A ten, you'll launch the Marines.
[time=2416] A one, you say, oh well.
[time=2421] Many of us become angry and as soon as our anger kicks in, we explode and we launch the Marines.
[time=2432] We create an all-out assault and attack because we've been injured.
[time=2438] Many times people have vented their anger and with hostility verbally assaulted somebody else
[time=2447] for such serious things as your son when he cut the grass missed a spot.
[time=2455] Your wife when she folded the clothes put him on the wrong shelf.
[time=2461] Your husband when he said he'd be home at five had the audacity to show up at five oh five.
[time=2473] You have to let it out, you're angry.
[time=2477] And we lack the discernment to say this is little, this is major.
[time=2486] Principle number five.
[time=2490] React slowly.
[time=2495] Proverbs chapter 14 tells us about the quick tempered man.
[time=2499] In verse 17 says, "A quick tempered man does foolish things and a crafty man is hated."
[time=2509] Then later in verse 29 it says, "A patient man has great understanding but a quick tempered man displays folly."
[time=2524] It is so important in athletics that you have quick reflexes.
[time=2530] If you're a boxer, if you don't have quick hands, you're not going to make it.
[time=2535] If you say, "Yep, I see it," here comes his left hook.
[time=2539] I think maybe I should put up my right hand to block it.
[time=2543] By the time you go through that process, it's over with.
[time=2548] If you're a basketball player, if you don't make it down the floor quickly, just stay there because the play will be back to you in a moment.
[time=2557] Quick reflexes are absolutely essential to athletics.
[time=2564] And they're absolutely devastating to emotions.
[time=2570] Whenever we react quickly, we usually react in the wrong way.
[time=2578] There's an excellent book written called Make Anger Your Ally by an author named Neil Clark Warren.
[time=2585] Dr. Warren's suggestion is this, that we recognize we're angry, that we recognize the situations that cause us to be angry,
[time=2596] and as soon as we feel that anger kick in, that we have a word that we've taught ourselves,
[time=2604] that triggers an alternate behavior so that when the anger kicks in, this word kicks in.
[time=2610] Dr. Warren says he uses the word "think." The anger starts to kick in, and he says "think." And that reminds him that he is not to react immediately, but he is to start to think through what's really taking place here.
[time=2629] In a phrase, it's this, we must learn to react out of insight, not out of impulse.
[time=2637] Many of us are impulsive people, and we just move the way we feel, and most of the time in athletics,
[time=2645] our impulses will serve us well, and in our emotions, they will serve us wrong.
[time=2652] When life gets moving too quick, you've got to slow it down.
[time=2658] Many of you are basketball fans, and you watch the Lakers in the Celtics game.
[time=2664] Most of the games that the Lakers won, they won with one simple strategy, fast break.
[time=2670] And once the Lakers got that fast break going, they were up and down the court before those Celtics knew which end they were supposed to run to,
[time=2678] and there is only one way to stop the fast break.
[time=2684] Call time out. There's no other way to do it. Call time out.
[time=2690] In the emotions of life, when they start moving fast, we need to call time out and refuse to react on impulse, but on insight.
[time=2700] Principle number six is this one.
[time=2704] We've mentioned it often. Refuse to clam up.
[time=2709] In Ephesians chapter four is where we get this famous statement, "Be angry and sin not."
[time=2717] It's all right to be angry, but we're not supposed to sin.
[time=2721] The next phrase says, "Do not let the sun go down on your wrath." That passage is saying this, "If you're angry, deal with it before this day ends.
[time=2732] You may need to drop back, not say anything for a moment, bite your tongue, but don't keep it bit for long.
[time=2742] Don't allow that anger to be internalized past the end of that day." God's saying, "Keep short emotional accounts." You see what happens is when we internalize that anger, we do two things.
[time=2757] We physically damage ourselves and we emotionally damage ourselves.
[time=2762] As I mentioned to you last week, when anger kicks in, our mind tells our body it's time for action.
[time=2769] So our heartbeat accelerates.
[time=2772] Our blood pressure increases.
[time=2775] Our adrenaline output starts to flow.
[time=2778] Our muscles become tense and rigid for action.
[time=2781] Our blood actually thickens so that it will clot in the case of injury.
[time=2786] Our digestive system shuts down and we're now primed for action.
[time=2792] Something has to be done with that physical energy.
[time=2796] And if nothing is done, it will be internalized and bring about devastating physical consequences.
[time=2804] Headaches, neck and backaches, ulcers, digestive problems, build up of cholesterol in your blood system,
[time=2814] possible stroke and heart attack, attacks of angina.
[time=2820] All are as often caused by emotional stress of anger as any other symptom.
[time=2828] Don't clam up.
[time=2830] Before the day's over, you've got to deal with it.
[time=2834] They will also damage us emotionally, they being the pen up anger.
[time=2844] It will cause us to internalize all those feelings and it will turn from anger and immediate response to bitterness,
[time=2854] a long lasting attitude.
[time=2856] And that is an internal poison that will poison our whole life.
[time=2862] Refuse to clam up.
[time=2866] Principle number seven.
[time=2868] Refuse to blow up.
[time=2871] Proverbs 29 verse 11.
[time=2876] It says, "A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control."
[time=2889] By saying full vent, it means the individual who blows up, who explodes.
[time=2899] Chapter 25 verse 28 says, "Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self control."
[time=2909] We are never more vulnerable than when we lose our temper and when we blow up.
[time=2916] One man put it this way, he says, "When you fly off the handle, you usually make a bad landing.
[time=2921] And when we blow up, we usually create a disaster that is far worse than the original situation that initiated our anger."
[time=2935] Whenever we vent our anger, that simply means like, "Open the door and let it fly," usually two things happen.
[time=2943] One we've already mentioned, and that is our anger is disproportionate to the situation.
[time=2949] I mean, we've got it inside and we churn it up and churn it up and churn it.
[time=2953] When it comes out, it comes out flying.
[time=2955] And we're far more angry than the actual situation could ever warrant.
[time=2960] And then secondly, quite often when we vent our anger, we totally misdirect it.
[time=2967] Often we're angry at this situation, "It's made me mad. I've got it inside and I get over here."
[time=2976] And then a little irritation occurs and guess what?
[time=2979] I unload on this little irritation, all of this stored up anger over here, and boom!
[time=2986] This person gets devastated because I misdirected my anger that should have been over here.
[time=2994] It's now over here.
[time=2996] Quite often, those of us who are in the working world all day long, our anger builds and it builds and it builds.
[time=3006] And we do not either have the skills or the confidence to deal with anger on the job so we internalize it.
[time=3013] We head for home. The traffic is horrendous and the anger escalates.
[time=3018] We walk in the door and our children or our spouse says something that's a minor irritation and boom!
[time=3029] Outcomes all the anger.
[time=3034] Refuse to blow up.
[time=3038] Principle number eight is this.
[time=3040] This will help you to refuse blowing up.
[time=3045] That is, remove yourself from the situation.
[time=3050] Proverbs 20 verse 3.
[time=3060] It is to a man's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.
[time=3072] The situation occurs. It occurs quickly.
[time=3076] Someone has instigated a quarrel, an occasion for your anger to be aroused.
[time=3084] A fool says, "I'll mix it up with you right here, right now." The wise man is the person who is able to back away and remove himself from the situation.
[time=3096] It's to a man's honor to avoid the strife.
[time=3100] We need to physically remove ourselves from the situation back away so that we can in that time out start applying the principles that we've just articulated the last few moments.
[time=3114] Not deal with it immediately, but retreat away from it to deal with it at just the right time.
[time=3123] Principle number nine, the most crucial of all, is this.
[time=3130] Release your anger through direct and controlled communication through direct and controlled communication.
[time=3146] I want to trace you through quite a few proverbs.
[time=3149] If you want to listen, that's fine. If you want to move, we'll take them in numerical order.
[time=3154] The first is Proverbs 15 1. It says this.
[time=3159] A gentle answer turns away wrath, but harsh words stir up anger.
[time=3167] You're angry? They're angry.
[time=3169] You must control and direct your words because if your words are harsh, you're going to escalate the problem.
[time=3177] But if they're gentle, they're going to be able to corral the problem and to work towards resolving it.
[time=3183] A soft or a gentle answer turns away wrath.
[time=3187] Now, two chapters later, chapter 17, verse 27.
[time=3193] A man of knowledge uses words with restraint, and a man of understanding is even tempered.
[time=3202] Direct communication. Words that are used but with restraint controlled, the temper is in check.
[time=3217] A few chapters later, chapter 21, verse 23.
[time=3224] He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity.
[time=3231] You're in a volatile situation that will either be calmed and quenched or it will be a quarrel that explodes.
[time=3242] And your tongue will make that decision.
[time=3248] Proverbs 25, verse 15 is one of my favorite in this series.
[time=3255] Through patience, a ruler can be persuaded and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
[time=3266] Direct controlled communication.
[time=3273] The final reference is 27, verses 4 through 6.
[time=3286] But who can stand before jealousy?
[time=3292] Better is an open rebuke than hidden love.
[time=3295] The kisses of an enemy may be profuse, but faithful are the wounds of a friend.
[time=3302] This passage is telling us that the anger has to be confronted.
[time=3309] Many people will hide, they'll defer confrontation for fear of what may happen.
[time=3320] But it is a greater love that compels us to confront.
[time=3326] Kisses can even come from Judas, but it's really a friend who cares enough to confront us,
[time=3336] though it may for a moment injure us because they may say things that we don't like to hear about ourselves.
[time=3345] But those are faithful wounds of a friend.
[time=3352] We must release our anger.
[time=3355] We cannot keep a pen up inside us, we must release it.
[time=3360] We cannot blow up and let it go out indiscriminately.
[time=3363] We must go to the people who are part of the situation of our anger and graciously talk about our anger
[time=3375] and how we can work to change the situation to make it acceptable to everybody.
[time=3385] Graciousness.
[time=3387] The wise person says Dr. Warren will ask himself these questions.
[time=3393] What is it that causes me to be angry?
[time=3396] Question number two.
[time=3398] What do I want to get out of the situation when I confront my anger?
[time=3404] And number three.
[time=3406] How can I get there?
[time=3409] What words and situations can I choose that will allow me to get that desired outcome?
[time=3417] And the side that I would like to throw in with this.
[time=3421] If someone is angry with you, please, if they are trying to directly release their anger through gracious communication,
[time=3432] allow them to do so.
[time=3435] One of the worst things you can do is somebody comes and they say, "I need to talk to you.
[time=3440] I'm angry about something." They get two statements into it and you say, "I'm sorry.
[time=3444] That's all right.
[time=3445] Let's just drop it.
[time=3446] I'm sorry." What you've said to them is, "I'm concerned about the outcome of this confrontation, and I would rather you internalize it and live with the consequences as say it, and me have to deal with it."
[time=3461] Don't cut off someone who's angry if they're dealing with it appropriately.
[time=3467] Principle number 10, our time is gone.
[time=3471] Reject reruns.
[time=3474] Our minds are the greatest video equipment in history.
[time=3479] And when somebody injures us, that goes down on tape.
[time=3484] And we walk away, angry, and we say, "I should have said this."
[time=3490] And then we rerun the tape.
[time=3492] "No, I should have said this.
[time=3493] That would have really zapped them." And day after day, some of us are playing 10-year-old reruns today.
[time=3503] Right now in this auditorium, people are being asked if they would like to receive Christ as their Savior.
[time=3517] And we would like to extend to you the same opportunity.
[time=3520] If you've never before opened up your heart to Christ, we would encourage you to do so right now.
[time=3526] In fact, I would like to lead in a simple prayer to help you to do that.
[time=3532] Lord Jesus, I know today that I'm a sinner.
[time=3537] And I believe you died on the cross for my sins.
[time=3541] I ask you to come into my heart and to be my Lord and my Savior.
[time=3547] [AMEN] If you made that decision today, we want to welcome you to the family of God and also offer you this booklet entitled "Your Decision."
