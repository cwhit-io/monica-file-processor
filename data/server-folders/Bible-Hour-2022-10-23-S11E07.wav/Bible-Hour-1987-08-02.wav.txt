[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] (music playing)
[time=90] The athlete and the question have a number of things in common, this in particular.
[time=120] Both of them face the urge to quit.
[time=125] During the 1984 Olympics, the great event the marathon saw two runners receive the standing
[time=131] ovation of the crowd.
[time=133] Of course, one runner was the one who won, the one that crossed the finish line first.
[time=139] But a second runner also received a standing ovation.
[time=143] This runner was nowhere close to finishing first.
[time=146] Instead, there was this urge to drop out.
[time=150] Fatigue had already transpired into exhaustion.
[time=155] The body of the runner was dehydrated, and now the mind had become disoriented.
[time=160] And as the runner approached the finish line, staggering this way and that way, falling
[time=167] to the knees, the runner stood up.
[time=172] People came on the track, some encouraging the runner to stop, others encouraging the runner to go on, and the runner finished.
[time=181] That runner overcame the urge to quit, and the whole stadium erupted in approval.
[time=189] It's too soon to quit.
[time=192] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=207] Thank you for joining us.
[time=209] Rick's servant today is taken from Proverbs chapter 3 and is entitled to discipline, denying the urge to drop out.
[time=216] Discipline is the essential ingredient to every success.
[time=219] The soldier is disciplined in his training to prepare for service.
[time=224] Children are disciplined by parents to prepare them for adulthood.
[time=228] Athletes are disciplined to prepare for the contest, but discipline does not end with preparation.
[time=233] In the real performance, discipline is equally essential.
[time=236] So our topic for study today is discipline, denying the urge to drop out.
[time=244] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=248] Our text today is Proverbs chapter 3 verses 11 and 12.
[time=254] Special music today includes a solo from Lisa McNamara, a duet from Susan Toyrak and Kathy
[time=262] Hawks, and a solo from Brian Losen.
[time=268] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=276] Being service originates from the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=281] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=286] Now, here's Rick.
[time=289] And to lift up in the heart of our city, the name of your son, our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, and we've come this very morning to worship him, and we would first of all declare
[time=300] the openness of our hearts to you and invite you today to meet with us, and not only to
[time=306] meet with us but to fill us within that we might know the reality of Christ living in
[time=312] our hearts.
[time=313] We've come to worship you today, O Lord, because we stand amazed in the presence of
[time=319] one so lovely, so divine, yet so humble that you would die on the cross for us.
[time=329] God, the only words we know to say today are, "My Jesus, I love thee.
[time=337] I know thou art mine, for thee all of the folly of sin I resign.
[time=346] My gracious Redeemer, my Savior, art thou.
[time=351] Fever I love thee, my Jesus, 'tis now, amen."
[time=359] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=361] We want to welcome you on this Sunday morning to the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=365] We're here today to thank God for His goodness in Christ Jesus.
[time=369] Though we're in a different place, this is a regular opportunity in the life of our church to worship God and to say that we love Him, and He is worthy of our allegiance.
[time=379] We're delighted that you've come to worship with us, and we also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the television ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=388] We trust that God puts in your heart the awareness that Christ is alive, and that you can sing even if you don't have the musical ability, "My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou
[time=399] art mine." We're going to ask Lisa to come now and lead us in that hymn of praise that she sings to us may it be not only the song of her lips, but the song of our hearts today, a commitment
[time=410] to loving Christ and serving Him.
[time=440] But mine, for thee all the far leads of sin, I reside, my gracious Redeemer, my Savior
[time=468] our art thou, if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, his now, I love thee because thou has first
[time=496] loved me, and purchased my pardon, on the cavalry's tree.
[time=513] I love thee for wearing the thorns on thy blood, if ever I loved thee, my Jesus, his
[time=541] now.
[time=571] I live my life, I live my life, I live my life, I live my life, I live my life, I live
[time=758] more than wonderful "You promised us that he would be a councilor,
[time=786] a mighty God and a prince of peace, he promised us that he would be a father and he would
[time=803] love us with a love that would not cease" "Well, I tried him and I found his promises
[time=816] are true, he said everything he said he would be" "The finest words I know could not begin
[time=833] to tell just how much he really means to me" "For he's more wonderful than my mind can
[time=856] see, he's more wonderful than my heart can believe he goes beyond my highest hopes and
[time=872] dreams, he's everything, everything that my soul ever long for, everything he promised
[time=891] so much more, more than amazing, more than more the less, more than more regular, whatever
[time=908] he's more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me"
[time=931] "I stand amazed to think the King of the Lord would come to live within the heart of
[time=946] me" "Oh, I'm a marvel just to know he really loves me when I think of who he is and who
[time=961] I am, he's more wonderful than my mind can see, he's more wonderful than my heart can
[time=984] believe he goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams, he's everything, he's everything
[time=1004] that my soul ever long for, everything he promised, and so much more, more than amazing, more
[time=1019] than marvelous, more than miraculous, could ever be, he's more than wonderful, that's
[time=1036] what Jesus is to me, he's everything that my soul ever long for, everything he promised
[time=1056] so much more, more than amazing, more than amazing, that's what Jesus is to think,
[time=1073] he's more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me, he's everything that my heart can
[time=1103] believe to me"
[time=1120] Thank you ladies, that song just thrills my heart, a few months ago we learned a chorus called "Celebrate God's Grace" on the back of your bulletin or the words to that chorus,
[time=1131] we're going to sing it a couple times now, if you don't know the words by heart, turn to the back side of your bulletin, there's no notes there, so you're going to have to follow the pianist and myself as far as the notes is concerned, but let's sing "Celebrate God's Grace" serving him with praise sent from God above, join heirs in the family of
[time=1149] God.
[time=1150] "Sawy God's Grace" serving him with praise, "I am the Holy Spirit of God, I am the Holy of God, who is gracious, with the glory, and is the grace of God."
[time=1179] Now that you all know it, let's do it one more time, celebrate God's Grace, "Sawy God's
[time=1200] Grace, "Sawy God's Grace" serving him with praise, "I am the Holy Spirit of God, I am the Holy of God, for His Grace is gracious, for me, and His heart is wonderful."
[time=1229] "I am the Holy Spirit of God, "I am the Holy Spirit of God, "I am the Holy Spirit of God, I am the Holy Spirit of God, I am the Holy Spirit of God."
[time=1245] Thank you.
[time=1250] Again, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1257] The service you're watching today is not coming from our home at Blackhawk Baptist Church, but from the heart of our city at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1265] It's necessary for us to move out of our auditorium one Sunday a year so that we can do some extensive maintenance work.
[time=1272] And that gives us the privilege of being in the heart of our city in the Grand Wayne Center where we can have all of our people in one service.
[time=1280] At Blackhawk we have two morning worship services, and we're looking forward to the building of a new sanctuary so that we will be able to allow more people to come and worship with us and also bring our congregation together under one roof at one time.
[time=1294] And we've begun construction on our new 2,000-seat sanctuary.
[time=1299] Just this past Friday we saw the first actual work being done. The footers were dug in two or three sections.
[time=1308] The concrete trucks were there and they were pouring the concrete and the iron bars were put in and were actually underway building our new sanctuary.
[time=1317] We're looking forward to the day when it opens probably in 12 or 13 months, but a lot of work is already underway.
[time=1325] And we can't thank God enough for what he has done on our behalf to allow us to have the privilege of this new facility that will allow our church to grow and expand in its ministry.
[time=1337] That also means some growth for the Bible hour.
[time=1340] We are in our present facilities cramped into a little production room and we simply set up sets against flat walls and today in a storage room.
[time=1350] But we'll have some room to do some more technical and better work with our television equipment.
[time=1355] And so we're looking forward to that opportunity in the future.
[time=1359] But the future is not buildings, it's people, reaching people for Christ and training believers.
[time=1365] A lot goes into training believers through church, Sunday school and particularly through the Ministry of Black Hawk Christian School as we endeavor to train the next generation of leaders.
[time=1376] Joining me today is Steve Longbrake, the administrative of our school. Steve, thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=1383] You're welcome, I'm really glad to be here.
[time=1385] I'm glad to have you as a close friend, but I'm also thankful for the great job you do leading the school that my two children are a part of and my third one is sort of looking forward to being a part of when he grows old enough.
[time=1398] Tell the people, please, just a moment, about the philosophy of Christian education. That's going to be new to many of them.
[time=1405] Okay, Black Hawk Christian School is dedicated to the fact that God's Word should be centered in every home.
[time=1413] And we teach our children that the truth of the Word of God should be integrated into everything that we teach, English, math, science, everything.
[time=1422] So we do that through teachers who are Christian people, dedicated to serve the Lord, and also equipped to provide an academic instruction that would really be excellent.
[time=1432] We're proud of them for that.
[time=1434] Steve, I want to throw in my support as a parent.
[time=1438] We've had Rachel and kindergarten in first grade in Rebecca and kindergarten, and we could not be more pleased with how well they're doing academically.
[time=1448] I don't remember what I could do in the first grade, but Rachel can really just about pick up anything at the end of the first grade and start reading it, and not just amazed at that.
[time=1458] They love school, too. When they begin to read and they learn how to do that, and they have people who are building into them the desire to learn, just like our teachers are, it's just great to watch.
[time=1470] You know what Steve talked about in that last sentence? The teachers are so important. Our kids' teachers so teased them in terms of creating an appetite that this summer, and I don't say this to talk about my kids.
[time=1483] Sure, I do. I'm talking about my kids, but Rachel finished last night her 100th book for the summer, because the teacher fostered that.
[time=1492] The philosophy of our school is academic excellence on a biblical foundation. In terms of academic excellence, what type of schools do our graduates matriculate to?
[time=1503] Our alumni have gone on to all kinds of schools here in Indiana and out of the state. Some secular, some Christian schools, and I'm really proud to say that they've done very well.
[time=1512] They've proven to be very well equipped to do college work.
[time=1516] Well, I'm excited about the elementary program. We've got a few years to look forward to the kids graduating.
[time=1523] Steve, many people may not know that a black car Christian school has an enrollment that's already filling up, but some grades are open, some are full. What's open and how can people register?
[time=1535] Right now, second grade, seventh grade, and third grade are full. But we have openings in all of the other grades. Some of those classes have just one or two openings, but we do have some openings in those.
[time=1550] And you can contact us by writing to us at 7321 East State Boulevard, or you can phone us at 749-8524. We'll be really glad to answer any questions that you might have and send out an application if that's what you'd like.
[time=1569] Well, we want to encourage you that if you have children of the school age, or perhaps you're a grandparent and you have grandchildren of the school age, that you might want to consider making an investment in the future, training the next generation of Christians.
[time=1584] I don't know the better way to do that than to have them active in a church, active in a Sunday school, and active in a Christian school.
[time=1591] Steve's encouraged you to write or call, and I want to add my encouragement to his words. Also, Steve, we have one of our graduates coming back.
[time=1600] That's right. One of our graduates is now going to teach in our school, and that's a first for us this year. That's really exciting for me.
[time=1607] Well, we're looking forward to that because we know she's a godly woman, but we're all equipped academically, and she's a winner.
[time=1614] And we hope that you'll take advantage of the Ministry of Black Hawk Christian School for your children.
[time=1620] The importance of God's Word is not only for children, not only for a Christian school, it's for each of us.
[time=1626] And as believers, if we're going to be strong and if we're going to have an impact, it's going to be because we've been men and women of God's Word.
[time=1635] I know of no greater way to strengthen your faith than to be faithfully studying God's Word on a daily basis.
[time=1643] That becomes a challenge. I know many people, they open up their Bible and they just hunt until they come to something they like and they end up rereading the same familiar passages, but they never grow beyond that.
[time=1654] Others lack a guide, a set of discipline that will get them into God's Word. We have a tool that we want to offer you today that will give you the structure and the discipline so that you'll read through the entire New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1669] It's rather simple challenge. It's only a chapter or day on an average out of God's Word.
[time=1675] The booklet is called Timeless Insights. And if you would write to us, we would be glad to send you a copy free.
[time=1682] You will study with us from the Book of Matthew through the entire New Testament to the Book of Revelation in one year's time.
[time=1691] In addition to it being a reading guide, it gives you as it's called Timeless Insights. We have collected in this one booklet some of the greatest applications of God's Word from scholars and practitioners of all times, and it's there for you.
[time=1706] We've purchased these books from our friends and walked through the Bible ministry and want to make them available to you if you'll simply write to us today.
[time=1715] Our address is the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1728] Once again, to receive a copy of Timeless Insights, simply write to us here at the Bible Hour Box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code is 46815.
[time=1741] We'd love to hear from you today, and a letter would be so meaningful to us. Just this morning I was reading some of the television mail, and I was encouraged by your words.
[time=1750] We would ask you to write today, and please do include the call letters of the station that you're watching today. Thank you.
[time=1771] [MUSIC - 18 seconds]
[time=1816] In my despair, Christ came to me when He alone would do.
[time=1840] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=1861] I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
[time=1886] When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun.
[time=1911] We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.
[time=1935] Unbounded grace, amazing grace.
[time=1953] [MUSIC]
[time=1969] Amazing grace.
[time=1984] Thank you, Brian. I would like to invite you to pray with me now. God, we've been quieted by a song to know of your amazing grace.
[time=1994] Today we would ask that it would be, as your word says, shed abroad in our hearts.
[time=2003] Father, today we would ask for that grace to give us strength, to repair relationships that have been damaged.
[time=2012] Some of us have harbored bitterness. So long in our life it has become a permanent fixture, and it will take radical surgery to have it removed.
[time=2023] God, we ask you to graciously to perform that surgery even today.
[time=2031] Father, we would ask for your amazing grace as we endeavor to run the race to which you have called us with discipline and perseverance.
[time=2043] Father, we would pray for your grace today that it would strengthen the hearts of those who have lost loved ones.
[time=2049] For Cecil Lawson and Jenny Lawson and their family as they have made the trip often to the cemetery this year.
[time=2057] We ask you to comfort the family of Stella Strong. We rejoice for her that she is absent from the body and present with the Lord.
[time=2066] But for her family day we would ask your amazing grace. We pray for Lon Keaton's father.
[time=2072] And our Dean Marker, she faces surgery, Alina Lots and Eleanor Layman as they recover from the same.
[time=2081] God, only your grace is adequate. God, we pray that your grace would give courage and comfort to those who face grave uncertainties in their life.
[time=2095] The uncertainty of a job, will it be there or will it be gone? Will it be here or will it be in another city?
[time=2104] God help us to know that our security is in you and in nothing else and nothing more.
[time=2113] Father, we often grow weary and we ask you to give us that second breath of wind.
[time=2119] A reviving by your spirit that gives us the energy to be disciplined and to deny the urge to drop out.
[time=2129] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=2136] This Sunday morning we're back in the heart of the Grand Wayne.
[time=2139] We came here in December purposefully because it was at that time we wanted to meet in one large auditorium to bring together this family.
[time=2148] With a challenge that we called Celebrate God's Grace.
[time=2152] That was nearly eight months ago. Today we've brought back some of that same music.
[time=2158] We began with celebration singing. The time is now to celebrate.
[time=2162] We sang the chorus. We brought back the familiar words Celebrate God's Grace.
[time=2168] Because on that occasion back in December of 86 we likened Celebrate God's Grace to the running of a race.
[time=2178] If you have your Bibles turned, if you will, to Hebrews chapter 12 and that was the passage we spoke from back in December.
[time=2186] It reads like this.
[time=2189] Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders.
[time=2199] And the sin that so easily entangles and let us run.
[time=2206] With perseverance the race marked out before us.
[time=2211] Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who, for the joy set before him,
[time=2222] endured the cross, scorning its shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=2234] Let me in, I hope, three minutes give you the four principles we gave you in December as a refresher today.
[time=2242] This passage likens the Christian life to the race of an athlete.
[time=2248] The first principle is this one.
[time=2251] To remember that you are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=2257] Hebrews chapter 11, as some have called it, is God's Hall of Fame.
[time=2262] It begins by listing those men and women who by faith followed God.
[time=2268] It listed Abraham.
[time=2271] And then after Abraham, the transition to his son Isaac.
[time=2276] From Isaac the transition to his son Jacob, from Jacob the transition to his son Joseph.
[time=2284] And from generation to generation there was always a people.
[time=2290] Someone who would carry the baton.
[time=2294] Someone who would run for God.
[time=2297] Throughout history the Church of Jesus Christ have always had people who would live their life as a living sacrifice.
[time=2305] And we are now called to be that generation.
[time=2312] The baton is being stretched forth to this body of people and the question that is being asked is will we run?
[time=2319] Will we carry the baton?
[time=2322] If you've ever participated in sports you will know that no one cheers more loudly, nor more enthusiastically for you than the other team members who have already run their leg.
[time=2334] We're surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses.
[time=2338] Those who have run before us and who now say I give the baton to you.
[time=2343] That's our first principle to remember.
[time=2347] We are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=2351] The second principle is the principle that we must remove all obstacles.
[time=2357] If you've never been to a swim meet you've probably seen one on television and very rarely will you see a swimmer compete in his sweats.
[time=2364] If you do he will not win.
[time=2368] They must remove anything that's a weight, anything that would hold them back.
[time=2374] That may be something good, a mirror weight or it may be something bad specifically sin.
[time=2381] But God says we're to remove sin from our life and we're to remove anything that's good but keeps us from doing the best thing what God has called us to.
[time=2392] We must live according to the principles and the precepts of the word.
[time=2397] The third principle that we were to run to finish.
[time=2401] I don't know about you but I'm a great starter.
[time=2404] In our garage there are a number of projects I've started.
[time=2408] One is a shelf that I made for a friend.
[time=2411] It's cut, it is stained, it is glued together but I haven't put the finish on it in six weeks.
[time=2418] Over in the other corner is the wood that I have bought to start another project.
[time=2422] Just a little wardrobe that we want to make for Kathy and myself.
[time=2426] The wood is there.
[time=2428] In another corner is the wood that's to finish off the deck in our backyard.
[time=2432] In each corner there is a different project that is started.
[time=2436] By your smiles you're indicting yourselves that you too are a great starter but not necessarily a great finisher.
[time=2444] The third principle we have to run to finish.
[time=2447] God's called us to a lifelong marathon.
[time=2450] The fourth principle is this we're to focus on the single goal of Christ looking unto Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=2458] Jesus teaches us this one key principle and that is this, the sacrifice always precedes the satisfaction.
[time=2469] We will always be called as an athlete or as a Christian to give our life as a sacrifice first.
[time=2476] The satisfaction may not be there yet but once we do that truth and time go hand in hand and they'll come a day
[time=2487] when the satisfaction exceeds the sacrifice.
[time=2492] Now as we come to this passage let me give you this fifth new principle.
[time=2500] It is found in verses three and following.
[time=2506] Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=2516] The fifth principle is this one.
[time=2519] Discipline is denying the urge to drop out.
[time=2527] I don't know of any event that was more exciting than the Olympic Games of 1984 and our country Los Angeles
[time=2535] and no event more exciting than the finish of the marathon.
[time=2539] Those of you who have watched it may remember that two different women received the standing ovation of the crowd.
[time=2547] The first woman of course was the woman who crossed the finish line first.
[time=2551] She won, she beat all the other women and international approval was placed upon her.
[time=2558] But a number of other women crossed the finishing line and received faint cheer from their own nationality
[time=2565] but none the ovation of the whole stadium.
[time=2569] But way back in the pack another lady crossed the line and received that spontaneous approval of the crowd.
[time=2579] She did not cross the finish line very quickly.
[time=2583] As she entered the Colosseum to make that one final lap her body was now fatigued.
[time=2592] Exhausted was too small a word to describe it.
[time=2596] She was dehydrated and delirious.
[time=2600] She looked as though she was intoxicated because she was stumbling one foot hardly making it from another.
[time=2606] No longer running a straight line but bobbing.
[time=2609] Groups of people came and some were trying to get her to stop and others were trying to get her to go.
[time=2616] And there were those that insisted that she drop out but she would not.
[time=2624] And she crossed the line and fell and collapsed.
[time=2631] That crowd stood in approval and said in life there is a value that says don't drop out.
[time=2642] No matter what it costs you don't drop out.
[time=2648] And you may be running a race that's 26 plus miles long.
[time=2652] It's too soon to quit.
[time=2655] That's what this passage is saying.
[time=2658] It says that we are to consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=2671] The word consider actually is a compound of two words to think again.
[time=2682] Now in life most of us vacillate. I for one am guilty.
[time=2686] We make a decision.
[time=2688] A little bit of time goes by and we look back on that decision and we want to change.
[time=2697] This word is saying when you're facing that temptation to back down think again.
[time=2705] He's already said once looking unto Jesus but he now says consider him a second time.
[time=2715] Why?
[time=2717] Well this is a purpose statement. It says consider him again so that you do not become weary and faint in your hearts.
[time=2730] These are the exact words that Aristotle chose to describe a runner.
[time=2734] Allow me to quote Barclay's paraphrase of Aristotle.
[time=2741] He's describing the athlete who has flung himself to the ground in panting relaxation and in extreme exhaustion.
[time=2751] Collapsing after the final surge that pushed him past the finishing post.
[time=2762] Not fainting.
[time=2765] Not collapsing.
[time=2769] Many of us have made significant spiritual commitments in our lives.
[time=2775] Some of us have made the commitment to follow Jesus Christ as our Savior.
[time=2781] And with enthusiasm we began to run.
[time=2785] But then came the sacrifices.
[time=2789] For some the sacrifice was the disapproval family who almost immediately said we are not from that religion.
[time=2798] And there was enormous pressure to conform to family values.
[time=2803] For others of you it was the pressure of friends who wanted to squeeze you back into the box that you used to fit in.
[time=2812] The box that they were so comfortable observing you in.
[time=2819] And the urge to drop out became great.
[time=2823] For others of you it became the test of finances.
[time=2827] Because you quickly saw that to live for Christ would cost you economically.
[time=2832] That you might not be able to do business the way you used to do business.
[time=2837] And now you want to reconsider.
[time=2840] And the urge to drop out is strong.
[time=2846] Others of you discovered that you made a second decision not only to allow Christ to be your Savior but there came an awareness in your life that you wanted to live a life absolutely surrendered to him.
[time=2861] And for a while you walked that path.
[time=2866] But then you began to consider that there were things that you really enjoyed in life.
[time=2870] And all the Bible calls them sinful but you don't want to be so harsh particularly with yourself.
[time=2878] And now you too want to drop out.
[time=2881] Or if not drop out just drop back.
[time=2885] And the urge grows strong.
[time=2891] And we are told to consider Christ.
[time=2895] That's the instruction that's given here.
[time=2899] And then for that instruction there's giving some insight.
[time=2902] What is there to consider in Christ?
[time=2905] The insight follows verse 4.
[time=2908] In your struggle against sin you have not resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
[time=2914] And if you've forgotten the word of encouragement that addresses you a son.
[time=2919] My son do not make light of the Lord's discipline and do not lose heart when he rebukes you.
[time=2924] Because the Lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.
[time=2936] In these verses that we've looked at today there are several strong illusions to suffering and sacrifice.
[time=2944] The first one is one that you won't quickly notice.
[time=2948] But back in chapter 12 verse 1 it says let us run with perseverance the race.
[time=2957] The Greek word for race is spelled A-G-O-N.
[time=2965] It's pronounced agon.
[time=2968] In English we add one letter to it, a Y.
[time=2972] And we come up with the word agonnie.
[time=2977] You see the race that the author has in mind is not the hundred yard dash
[time=2985] where with a burst of speed for ten seconds the athlete bolts out of the block and the race is over before exhaustion even begins to hit.
[time=2995] He's talking about a marathon where mile after mile, minute after minute
[time=3005] then our following hour the athlete strives and runs and runs and runs
[time=3015] and the only word fit to describe such a race is the word agonnie.
[time=3025] There's a second reference to suffering and sacrifice that says that we are looking unto Jesus.
[time=3032] Who for the joy that's the satisfaction that was set before him it hasn't come yet.
[time=3039] First had to precede the sacrifice that he did these three things.
[time=3045] One, he endured the cross.
[time=3048] Two, he despised or he scorned the same.
[time=3052] And three, he tasted of the victory.
[time=3059] There is a settled distinction though between sacrifice and suffering.
[time=3065] Though they feel the same there is one settled distinction.
[time=3070] Suffering is hardship, difficulty and pain that life thrusts upon you.
[time=3079] Some of you today are battling with cancer. Life thrusted that upon you.
[time=3085] Others of you are facing the uncertainty of your job.
[time=3089] Life thrusted that upon you.
[time=3093] Some of you are walking alone. Your loved one died too soon.
[time=3099] Life thrusts that upon you and you are suffering.
[time=3105] Sacrifice is different in that sacrifice is not thrusted upon us by life
[time=3111] but sacrifice is hardship or pain that we are enduring out of personal choice.
[time=3121] Life puts suffering upon us but we choose to sacrifice because there is something greater that we want at the end.
[time=3130] The wise business mind sacrifices today by taking money that could be spent with discretion on something pleasurable
[time=3139] and says, "I will sacrifice that pleasure today and I will invest it for the future."
[time=3146] Sacrifice is the person who says, "I have complete freedom of how I will invest my time and I choose to give it away."
[time=3156] Sacrifice is the individual who says, "God hears my life. You take it.
[time=3165] I give it to you as a living sacrifice and I will make the hard choices no matter how pleasant or unpleasant they may seem to me."
[time=3179] Jesus was an example of one who both suffered and sacrificed.
[time=3185] And we are given this insight to look back to him and remember that he refused to quit.
[time=3201] He went all the way for us.
[time=3207] These Hebrews who were the original recipients of the letter were suffering.
[time=3214] Some of them had been ostracized by their families. Still more of them than ostracized by friends.
[time=3221] Some had been pronounced dead by their fathers because they had denied their Hebrew faith and had become Christians.
[time=3229] They were indeed suffering because they chose to sacrifice their lives as a living example for Christ.
[time=3236] But he said this in verse 4, "In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood."
[time=3244] A reminder that Christ went all the way to the finish line of death for us.
[time=3249] And we are to stop at nothing short or including that for him.
[time=3257] That's why we are to look to him and we are to look to him a second time and say yes I have sacrificed.
[time=3264] I may have sacrificed for vacation Bible school.
[time=3267] You may have sacrificed this morning as a technician or a sound man or an usher or nursery worker to make this service possible.
[time=3275] You may be sacrificing and celebrate God's grace to give and they will come and urge to drop out.
[time=3281] But it says have we sacrificed of our time in some way that approaches shedding blood?
[time=3289] Have we given financially so much that it approaches that we have given our life? Obviously not.
[time=3299] In most natatoriums that's a fancy way of saying indoor swimming pool where races are held.
[time=3306] They usually have the pool records.
[time=3310] I remember one swim pool in particular.
[time=3314] It was at our high school and it was a new pool so just about every time a meet was held a new pool record was set.
[time=3321] And we always felt quite proud of ourselves because at the end of a race occasionally you would hear the announcer say
[time=3327] the race was won by and they named the athlete in such and such a time establishing a new pool record.
[time=3335] And oh we felt so proud we were fast.
[time=3341] There was another swimming pool across town at a rival high school.
[time=3347] That swim pool had been there for a while and their pool records were fast.
[time=3356] But beyond the pool records there was one more set of times.
[time=3362] This set of times instead of saying pool records had national high school record.
[time=3369] On a Friday night our team had swum and we were fast.
[time=3374] And we set a new pool record in our pool and we went to their pool and the same relay team just missed a new pool record
[time=3382] and we thought we were fast until we compared the times of the national high school record.
[time=3390] And we discovered that a guy from Santa Clara swim club named Mark Spitz had individually swam faster than the four of us put together.
[time=3402] I didn't feel so fast anymore.
[time=3407] You see accomplishment or sacrifice is only relative to what you choose to compare to.
[time=3416] And when you compare yourself as a swimmer to a few turkeys you look pretty fast.
[time=3424] You compare yourself to a few sharks in the water.
[time=3428] You know it's time to get out.
[time=3431] We weren't so fast. We simply chose to compare ourselves to the wrong standard.
[time=3438] You know in our Christian life many of us are suffering and some of us are sacrificing and I don't mean to minimize that in anyone's life
[time=3446] but which of us have sacrificed to the point where we say put my record right there next to the one that says Jesus Christ.
[time=3459] In comparison, Harry Lee's name may be close to that.
[time=3466] Mine is not. Few of ours is.
[time=3473] We are to consider Christ with the insight that he did not stop until the race was finished.
[time=3486] In every contest of any distance there will be an undeniable urge within to quit.
[time=3501] When you feel that urge coming within, remember Christ and say these words to yourself.
[time=3510] It's too soon to quit.
[time=3528] This has been a unique day for us in a very special day but nothing would make it more special than if you were to open up your heart to Christ.
[time=3537] Perhaps today you sense you need him a savior.
[time=3540] I would like to invite you to pray with me a simple prayer allowing Christ to come into your life.
[time=3548] Lord Jesus I sense today that I'm a sinner and I believe that you are God and that you died on the cross for me.
[time=3557] I ask you to come into my heart and to be my savior in your name, amen.
