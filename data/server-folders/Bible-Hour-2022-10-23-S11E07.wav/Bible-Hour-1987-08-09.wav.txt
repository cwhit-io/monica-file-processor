[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=83] The athlete in the question...
[time=85] I have had the privilege of preaching here at Blackhawk for six years, and for each of
[time=100] those years there's been one event I've been waiting for, and today is that day.
[time=105] Today I have the privilege of introducing to you a man by the name of Dr. David Burnham.
[time=112] David is the man who led me to Christ when I was a high school student.
[time=116] Through his leadership and ministry God spoke to my own heart and gave me a call into the ministry.
[time=122] More than my education or my experience over the years, it's been his modeling and his leadership that has shaped my life and my own personal ministry.
[time=132] David has served as the pastor of the 7000 member Chapel and University Park for 26 years,
[time=139] and then on to Bible Town in Boca Raton, Florida.
[time=142] But today he is working as the chairman of an international sports coalition to take the gospel to the athletes of the Olympics in 1988 in Seoul, Korea.
[time=152] But today it's our privilege of sharing this dynamic man of God with each of you here on
[time=159] the Bible Hour.
[time=173] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=178] Thank you for joining us.
[time=179] Today's message will be brought to us by a special guest, Dr. David Burnham.
[time=185] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us as Dr. Burnham shares with us what the Lord has laid on his heart.
[time=193] Our special musical guests today are Bruce and Brenda Jackson.
[time=200] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=209] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=221] Use this to glorify your name in our lives as we worship you and praise you.
[time=226] We've come here to see Jesus and Him only, and we see Him in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=234] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=236] During these summer days of August, we are privileged to come into this auditorium and praise the Lord.
[time=243] Some of us are praising the Lord today that this auditorium is air conditioned.
[time=247] It rained earlier this morning as I walked by some windows between services.
[time=252] I saw the rain going back up in way of humidity, but you've come today, and we're so thankful we can lift our voices today and sing about our God that He is holy.
[time=262] We're delighted that you've come here that we can worship together face to face and to share in the friendship of knowing Christ.
[time=268] We're also thankful for you friends who join us by way of television, that we can come into your home.
[time=274] Many of you are in the hospital today, perhaps even in the prison, but the word of God is not bound by a prison, and we can today share that word of promise in Jesus Christ.
[time=284] Thank you for worshiping with us.
[time=287] During the month of August, we give our choir a rest, an opportunity to simply sit and take in as they week by week give out, and so we've invited some guests to be with us today to lead us in worship and in singing and song, and today we're delighted to have the Jacksons with us.
[time=303] They come to us from Ohio.
[time=304] They are ministering there in the Dayton area, and Bruce and Brenda have come today to lead
[time=310] us in worship.
[time=311] Welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=312] We're delighted you're here.
[time=317] Jesus, what a friend for sinners, Jesus, love her of my soul, friends may fail me,
[time=339] follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me,
[time=859] (gentle music)
[time=948] (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=970] (gentle music)
[time=1008] The call of a song to turn her eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1013] Hello again, and let me thank you for this second time for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1022] We sincerely hope that God will use this hour that we spend together to draw you into a closer walk with Christ and to strengthen your faith and give you spiritual energy for a new week.
[time=1034] I look forward to church every Sunday.
[time=1036] For me, it's much like the half-time talk from the coach during the football game.
[time=1041] And today, in particular, I'm looking forward to that talk because it's from my coach.
[time=1046] A man by the name of David Burnham, 17 years ago, led me to Christ when I was 17 years old.
[time=1053] As a high school student, I was looking for a man's man, and David was that man who would stand for Christ, and he influenced me, and I gave my heart to the Lord.
[time=1063] And it was through his leadership and more his example that I learned to preach and teach God's Word.
[time=1069] And so today, it's very much of a privilege for me to have him here at Blackhawk and on the Bible Hour to challenge you with God's Word.
[time=1077] I know today your life will be enriched as we study the Scriptures together as Pastor David Burnham leads us.
[time=1084] So today is a special day for me, and I hope just as special for you.
[time=1090] Each week during the month of August, we've been offering you this booklet entitled "Timeless Insights."
[time=1096] As I've shared with you over the past week, "Timeless Insights" is a daily Bible study tool.
[time=1102] By using it, you'll move through the entire New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1107] It requires of you a commitment to read approximately one chapter of the Bible a day.
[time=1113] Inside "Timeless Insights," though, there is much more than just that one day Bible study guide.
[time=1118] For example, inside, there are biographies each month.
[time=1121] This month's biography is about Isaac Watts, who has written some of the greatest hymns that our hymnbook holds.
[time=1128] In addition to Isaac Watts' biography, in each lesson, along with an explanation of the passage you've read for that day, there is, of course, a timeless insight.
[time=1139] They come from such great authors and men of God as Charles Haddon Spurgeon or Matthew Henry.
[time=1146] The next day is Isaac Watts, who, though he was a songwriter, was a great commentator on the Scriptures as well.
[time=1152] Albert Barnes is quoted in Andrew Murray, the great prayer warrior of the 1800s.
[time=1158] John Calvin, the reformer in Switzerland, who brought about the reformation to the Central European countries.
[time=1164] Martin Luther, who thundered forth his 92 theses and spoke with authority.
[time=1170] The Scriptures only, his comments are in here.
[time=1173] And then A.W. Tozer, a man of God earlier this century, who spoke of personal holiness.
[time=1179] All of this treasury is nestled together in timeless insights, and we want you to have it.
[time=1185] We want you to be daily in God's Word so that you can be growing more than Sunday by Sunday
[time=1191] as we share this hour together, but that daily you're in God's Word.
[time=1195] If you'll write to us today, we'll send you your copy so you can begin reading in timeless insights.
[time=1201] If you'll write, write to the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1213] Once again, our address is the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1221] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=1225] Before we go back to our worship service, I want to invite you to join us on Thursday nights during the month of August for a film series with Tim Timmons.
[time=1234] Tim may not be a name familiar to many of you.
[time=1237] Tim is a recently developing author and speaker.
[time=1241] He has two great gifts.
[time=1243] One, he has tremendous insight into the Scriptures, and that is certainly the most important.
[time=1248] But his second gift is that he is a man gifted with humor.
[time=1252] He can make us laugh at life and enjoy that hour of insight.
[time=1258] It's a lot like taking the best of both worlds.
[time=1262] The best of Scripture and the best of modern communication techniques, and Tim's brought them together.
[time=1269] He has a finger right on the pulse of our generation.
[time=1273] He understands life today very well, and he speaks clearly about it.
[time=1278] We'd love to invite you to join us here at Blackhawk on Thursday nights at 7 o'clock during the month of August
[time=1284] before the Summer Bible Conference film series with Tim Timmons.
[time=1289] Again, as I mentioned earlier, as we go back to our morning worship service, I'll be here.
[time=1293] But like you, I'll be listening today to one of God's greatest preachers of this hour, Dr. David Burnham.
[time=1299] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1314] I have a place in the sky of the morning.
[time=1322] The morning ages but God and the last year.
[time=1334] When all my hopes and plans are fading like a shadow.
[time=1344] When all my dreams like crumble at my feet.
[time=1353] I will look up and know the night will bring tomorrow
[time=1362] and that my Lord will free what I need.
[time=1370] Yeah, I will pray with you sweet because of shame.
[time=1379] When I am up to now, the desert's full spring.
[time=1389] Yeah, I'm praying the star of the morning.
[time=1398] The home of the ages, my God and my King.
[time=1411] There may be times when I have everything life offers.
[time=1420] There may be times when there's nothing I can play.
[time=1430] In poverty or in abundance, I will praise Him with my last prayer.
[time=1443] I will praise His name.
[time=1448] Yeah, I will praise Him with sweet because of shame.
[time=1456] When I am up to now, the desert's full spring.
[time=1466] Yeah, I'm praying the star of the morning.
[time=1475] The home of the ages, my God and my King.
[time=1488] Thank you so much, Bruce and Brendan.
[time=1509] We'll look forward with anticipation to hearing your ministry again tonight as we assemble at six o'clock.
[time=1515] There are in life some opportunities, rare special privileges that are afforded to us.
[time=1522] One of those is an opportunity to cross paths with our past.
[time=1528] I know whenever we go back to Akron, Ohio for a holiday, which is hometown for Kathy and I, one of the things that we like to do is to drive by your old house.
[time=1537] Have you ever driven by the house you grew up in?
[time=1540] I hadn't finished growing up, but there was a house where I started that process in a town called Kaga Falls.
[time=1546] When you go back, you discover things.
[time=1549] One of the things I discovered is the house wasn't as big as I thought.
[time=1553] What happened was I grew up.
[time=1555] The houses used to be so far apart.
[time=1558] I think you can touch them when you stand like this, but it didn't seem like that.
[time=1562] But to go back and to touch your past, it does something by rekindling some flame of fire and commitment.
[time=1569] But one of the disappointments often is when you go back to your past, you discover it's not as big as you thought it was.
[time=1576] But then there are those rare opportunities when you cross paths with your past, and it's even bigger.
[time=1584] Today, that is the privilege that is mine.
[time=1587] I'm crossing paths with my past.
[time=1590] As a high school student, I came to know Christ through the ministry of a camp, and particularly David Burnham,
[time=1596] the pastor of the church that operated the camp, came to know Christ because of a man's man, a football player who would declare Christ with energy.
[time=1605] I was learned, I was educated.
[time=1608] That was a better word.
[time=1610] But I really learned by his example.
[time=1613] Today, we cross paths.
[time=1615] This isn't the first time, but each time we cross paths, there is no disappointment.
[time=1619] It's not that I can reach out and touch what used to be big, and now it's small.
[time=1623] As we greet, I discover that growth in Christ doesn't quit, but it becomes greater.
[time=1628] And it's really a privilege today for me to share my past, but also a vision for the future with you as Pastor Burnham is here.
[time=1636] Sue, his wife, is in this service. She wasn't in the last one.
[time=1640] I don't mean to embarrass you, but this is Mrs. Burnham.
[time=1643] Could you stand, Sue, in the center of the floor here?
[time=1646] Sue has a master's degree in counseling, has written books, and is quite a capable person
[time=1652] of integrity, and of wisdom, and home Bible studies, and counseling.
[time=1657] She did a seminar with Dave on Friday night, but this is Pastor David Burnham.
[time=1661] It's a delight to welcome him here to Blackhawk.
[time=1665] That's a very gracious introduction.
[time=1672] And from a gracious introduction, there is also the privilege to be able to be here at Blackhawk Church.
[time=1678] And I'm thankful for what God is doing here at Blackhawk, and thankful for what God is doing in the life of Rick,
[time=1685] and also Kathy, and their family, and the life of this church.
[time=1690] It was the Apostle John who said, "I have no greater joy than to know that my sons and daughters in the faith walk in the truth."
[time=1698] And that's a joy to see across each of our lives those that God brings that can be influenced and continue to minister
[time=1707] and the gifts that God has given to them.
[time=1710] And that's especially true here.
[time=1712] I've known of Blackhawk for some time, and for the heritage, and for the labor of love that has gone into this church.
[time=1719] But what a joy to know that one of God's choice servants is ministering right here.
[time=1724] And together you are building, expecting God to do something not only in the future, but right now.
[time=1731] And the principles that you are using will utilize the buildings that God is giving to you.
[time=1736] For 30 years I have pastored, then I took a sabbatical.
[time=1740] I took a two-year assignment to become the chairman of the International Sports Coalition.
[time=1746] We bring together a network of the athletic ministries, recreation ministries that God has used throughout America,
[time=1754] portions of the world, along with the local church that is committed to reaching men and young people for Christ.
[time=1761] Our goal is to network together so that at the Olympics in 1988 we can train representatives from each nation here on the earth
[time=1769] to come and to be trained in the knowledge of how to use sports, a world language.
[time=1775] Music and sports provide a world language and provide that language for them to go into their country
[time=1781] to announce that Jesus Christ truly is Lord, and to proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1788] One of the privileges of being a part of the coalition, it gives me opportunity to travel.
[time=1794] And I have not done that since college days to the extent that I can do it now.
[time=1798] And when I travel I get into all kinds of churches.
[time=1801] It is interesting to see the different responses.
[time=1804] I have grown up in a particular type of church and form of worship that sometimes there is polite applause
[time=1810] every now and then in amen, oftentimes snoring.
[time=1814] But other times you just get the nods, but if you go into some type of Presbyterian churches, I get just eye blinks.
[time=1822] They don't say much, they just nod or blink their eyes.
[time=1825] I have had the privilege to also be in a few choice black churches that let you know how you are preaching.
[time=1832] They tell you how you are preaching.
[time=1834] And it is a joy to have them let you hear how they are responding.
[time=1839] And the one black pastor that taught me this said, "Now just listen carefully.
[time=1843] If they like what you are saying, if they are enjoying it, here is what they will say."
[time=1849] And he told me and then I listened and he was right.
[time=1852] Do you know what they say?
[time=1854] "Preach on, preach on, all right, preach on." And it does something to you, you just preach on and on and on.
[time=1863] But I learned also, if you get into material that they are not sure they agree with,
[time=1872] you are just getting a little too close to home and they don't know where you are going for sure.
[time=1876] They also talk to you and here is what they say.
[time=1879] Helping Lord, helping, helping Lord, helping.
[time=1884] And then if you get into material they don't even like, they don't agree with, it is too close to home.
[time=1888] They simply say, "Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, have mercy." Well you know that's quite a response to give you and it gives you good information.
[time=1898] Preach on, helping Lord, have mercy.
[time=1901] And I'm not sure where you are today in your response, but I'd like for you to be encouraged.
[time=1907] The beautiful songs of praise that we heard, the singing together.
[time=1911] To be able to study the Word of God, may God encourage you today.
[time=1915] Preach on, God give us mercy and help us to study His Word in a meaningful way.
[time=1921] In 1 Samuel the 18th chapter, we find a story that is not new.
[time=1926] Most of us know something about it, but there are some details this morning that I would like to share with you
[time=1933] that could give some insight that might encourage you this day.
[time=1937] 1 Samuel chapter 18 verse 1, "And it came to pass that when David had made an end of speaking unto Saul,
[time=1947] that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David.
[time=1953] And Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
[time=1957] And Saul took him that day and would not let David go no more home to his father's house.
[time=1964] Then Jonathan and David made a covenant because Jonathan loved David as his own soul.
[time=1973] And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him.
[time=1977] And he gave it to David and his garments, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle.
[time=1984] It's a familiar story of David and Jonathan.
[time=1988] It's a story of friendship.
[time=1990] It's a story that into our lives there comes that special gift.
[time=1994] Do you have a friend?
[time=1996] Is there someone that you trust?
[time=1998] Is there someone that's precious to you?
[time=2001] Since the last time that I saw Rick and Kathy, my wife and I have had the privilege of becoming grandparents.
[time=2008] That is some experience.
[time=2011] Grandparents love to share their pictures.
[time=2013] Can I show you mine this morning of my grandson?
[time=2016] My oldest daughter, Brenda and Bob, her husband, shared together in the unity of their love and giving to our home, Bradley.
[time=2026] And when Bradley came into our lives, it was quite a joy.
[time=2030] They make you do funny things.
[time=2032] I couldn't believe that my wife, as mature as she was, could make the strange faces that she makes.
[time=2038] And she looked at me and she said, "I never heard such noises come out of a human being's mouth as you make to make that little guy laugh."
[time=2045] Well, we do all those strange things, but I bought him a videotape.
[time=2048] Now he's only nine months old, and at two months I bought him this videotape because I wanted to impress him with something.
[time=2055] I wanted to impress him with a hero of the faith.
[time=2059] I believe that my wife has taught that when a mother is expecting, she should be reading and quoting Scripture.
[time=2066] It affects her own spirit.
[time=2068] I think even the preparation in the delivery of a child.
[time=2071] One of the last things that I had to privilege to say to our daughter before she delivered was to quote Scripture to her and the encouragement that that brings.
[time=2079] When Bradley was first in our home and I could hold him in my arms, I quoted Scripture to his heart and to his spirit.
[time=2086] Well, I bought him this wonderful video.
[time=2088] They've got some now that they spent half a million dollars on to produce great heroes of the faith.
[time=2094] And I bought him David and Goliath.
[time=2097] I wanted him to know that there was a hero like David.
[time=2100] And so I bought him that video and I put it on and I hold him up there and I say, look at that.
[time=2104] Look at that.
[time=2105] Did you see that, Bradley?
[time=2107] Did you see David go after that big giant?
[time=2110] All that giant said, "You Israelites are fearful." And David, a shepherd boy, did you see him go out against him?
[time=2119] Even when the Philistine said, "Am I a dog?" And David came and said, "In the name of the Lord?" And he released that stone from that slingshot.
[time=2128] Did you see that, Bradley?
[time=2130] Oh, there's a hero, Bradley, that God wants you to know about.
[time=2135] The videotape finished.
[time=2138] I flicked the switch on the television and immediately there came up another picture.
[time=2143] It was a television talk show and these words, "You can't trust anybody who preaches on TV."
[time=2152] I couldn't believe it.
[time=2153] I had just finished showing my grandson a hero of the faith.
[time=2157] And this program was saying, "You can't trust anyone." Newsweek magazine said the same thing in its articles.
[time=2163] Are the TV preachers trustworthy?
[time=2166] The question is being asked.
[time=2168] I've never known it in my ministry.
[time=2170] There's a question about integrity.
[time=2172] Can you trust anyone?
[time=2174] Are leaders trustworthy?
[time=2177] Is the word trustworthy?
[time=2179] Whether it be at Harvard Business School in a scholarship that is offered, and a chair to be endowed in ethics, some question.
[time=2187] Ethics, Time Magazine displays it right on its cover.
[time=2191] Ethics, is there a right?
[time=2193] Is there a wrong?
[time=2194] Ted Koppel speaks to Duke University commencement exercises.
[time=2198] And he says, "As a nation, we have been vanitized." We have just a talk show mentality, just a game show appearance.
[time=2207] And he mentioned that we need to return to the ten commandments.
[time=2211] Rights and wrongs.
[time=2213] Is there anyone that you can trust?
[time=2215] Is there a right?
[time=2216] Is there a wrong?
[time=2217] And I held him in my arms.
[time=2219] And I said, "Oh, Bradley, I want to tell you that there is someone you can trust.
[time=2224] All preachers are not phonies.
[time=2226] All ministries are not shady.
[time=2229] And all items about money are not always self-aggrandizement.
[time=2234] No, there are people you can trust, and there are friends.
[time=2238] There are friends that you can trust.
[time=2242] Oh, blessed is the little boy who does not walk in the council of the ungodly, or stand in the way of sinners, or sit in the seat of the scornful.
[time=2251] Blessed is the little boy, oh, Bradley.
[time=2254] Blessed is the little boy who does meditate on the Word of God day and night.
[time=2259] You'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.
[time=2263] You'll bring forth your fruit and your season.
[time=2266] Your leaf, Bradley, will not wither.
[time=2268] Oh, Bradley, whatever you do or prosper, you'll find the use of all the potential that God has given to you.
[time=2276] And I'd hold that little guy.
[time=2278] And I'd say, Bradley, I want to be a friend to you.
[time=2282] My little friend, God has a friend for you that will never leave you and never forsake you.
[time=2289] The story of Jonathan and David's a beautiful story of friendship.
[time=2293] The Lord Jesus refers to that same thing when he calls his own disciples in John chapter 15, "You are my friends." He said, "I want you to produce much fruit.
[time=2304] I desire that you bear much fruit, that you love one another." But he said, "You are my disciples if you obey my commands." And he says it again in a very personal way, "You are my friends."
[time=2318] The Lord Jesus spoke with those kind of loving words.
[time=2321] Jonathan and David present to us a beautiful picture.
[time=2324] And in this familiar story, there are four qualities I would like to point out.
[time=2330] Very quickly for you to observe them.
[time=2333] It's not a total lesson on friendship, but it will give to you some qualities that friendship must have.
[time=2341] When Jonathan and David met each other following the battle of David and Goliath,
[time=2347] this gives us a picture of a meaningful friendship.
[time=2351] Rallow May said that in friendships, many of us really only have acquaintances.
[time=2356] 500 to 2,500 acquaintances are made every year.
[time=2361] People that we say hello to, someone we say have a good day to, but we really don't know them.
[time=2367] They're just acquaintances.
[time=2369] Then there are those that we might call friendships, but in reality, they are only associates.
[time=2375] We work with them.
[time=2377] We might play with them in games of recreation or sporting events.
[time=2381] We have common tasks that we do together, but we don't share our secrets.
[time=2387] A friendship can sometimes be identified by relationship.
[time=2392] A relationship of aunts and uncles, cousins, father, mother, brother, sister.
[time=2398] That's a physical relationship.
[time=2400] And the friendship is really only based on our physical heritage.
[time=2404] Some families are close and some are not close.
[time=2407] And then there's a relationship that I believe occurs in the local church.
[time=2411] That when we receive Christ as our Savior, it makes us brothers and sisters.
[time=2416] Regardless of where we are in the world we meet and we have a common heritage, our faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2423] And sometimes in the church we're close.
[time=2426] And sometimes like our families.
[time=2428] Physically, we're not very close.
[time=2430] But an acquaintance, an associate, and even our relationships do not give to us
[time=2436] that inner longing for a deep, meaningful friendship that each of us desires.
[time=2441] It was in Fortune magazine that it wrote concerning the American male.
[time=2446] How he is friendless.
[time=2447] He lives in isolation.
[time=2449] Oftentimes he's a competitor.
[time=2451] He doesn't know how to have companionship.
[time=2454] One book is entitled The Friendless American Male.
[time=2457] I don't know about you today whether you have a friend or not.
[time=2461] Do you have a friend?
[time=2463] Do you have a friend who's your mate?
[time=2466] Are you friends with your children?
[time=2468] Do you have a friend that you trust?
[time=2471] There is a level of friendship that I call personal friendship that I believe describes a sharing of life, building, shaping events.
[time=2481] That somehow an event happens in our life that shapes our character.
[time=2486] And we share that with someone.
[time=2488] And if it's an event, it could be just one time, but we'll have something that we share with that person for a long time.
[time=2495] I remember a group of men putting their arms around each other in a huddle.
[time=2499] And in the fourth quarter, beaten and tired.
[time=2503] Playing in those days, one platoon football, you had to play both ways.
[time=2508] We were in the hardest battle of all the games that I had ever played in.
[time=2512] I've been in lots of huddles.
[time=2514] I've been in lots of fourth quarters.
[time=2516] But that fourth quarter had something I have always remembered.
[time=2520] That band of men put their heads, hearts, and bodies together and said, "We're going to make it." "We're going to make it." And they did.
[time=2530] And whenever we see each other, years later, we go back to that event.
[time=2535] It shaped us, and it shaped some character.
[time=2538] Some of you have that through a war experience.
[time=2541] Some of you have it through a difficulty, a time of rejoicing.
[time=2543] You have that in your life.
[time=2545] But that's an event.
[time=2547] And in some of our lives, there are people who share a whole series of events, maybe a college roommate, a friend that we live by for a number of years, people that we got to know through a shaping of events that we accumulated.
[time=2560] Now they may have even moved away, but whenever you see them, it's a quality that you can understand that it's an enduring friendship.
[time=2567] You know why?
[time=2568] Whenever you see them again, you pick up right where you left off.
[time=2572] You come right together again, and you can just take right off where you left off.
[time=2577] It's an enduring friendship.
[time=2579] You have shared a number of life-shaping events.
[time=2583] But very few of us have many growing, enduring friendships
[time=2590] that right now are building on a constant basis.
[time=2594] Most of us have one, two, or three enduring, growing friendships
[time=2600] that right now we are sharing together.
[time=2603] We need them.
[time=2604] Do you have one?
[time=2605] David and Jonathan had just that.
[time=2608] When Jesus spoke to His disciples, they had just that, a growing, enduring friendship.
[time=2614] They continued to have shaping events that built their life.
[time=2618] And until Jonathan's life ends, he and David are friends, and they're friends for a lifetime, and all of David's life.
[time=2627] Do you have a friend?
[time=2629] In this passage of Scripture, let me point out just a couple of things that relate to friendship, and notice this insight.
[time=2635] Verse 1, "And it came to pass after the battle of David and Goliath, when David had made an end to speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David." One of the qualities of friendship is that there is an attraction of spirit,
[time=2654] an attraction of spirit.
[time=2656] There's just something about that person that attracts you, and your spirit is knitted.
[time=2662] The word is chained.
[time=2663] You just are one with that person's spirit.
[time=2668] I believe in each of our lives there are kinds of people that we're attracted to.
[time=2673] I'm attracted to men that are competitive or courageous.
[time=2677] I like men that regardless of athletic are the events of life.
[time=2681] I'm just attracted to that spirit, that character that has courage.
[time=2686] I'm attracted to that.
[time=2688] Now, David and Jonathan were attracted to each other.
[time=2691] You see, Jonathan was also a man of courage.
[time=2694] Earlier we read that when Saul, his father, had retreated, that Jonathan had taken his armor bearer, and they had gone against the Philistines, and Jonathan had gone up a wall that could not be climbed, but Jonathan determined he would climb it anyway.
[time=2713] It was inaccessible, but he made it accessible, and he climbed it, and he routed an entire garrison of Philistines himself.
[time=2724] He was really courageous, but now Jonathan had watched young David, and he saw in the spirit of David that courage, and his heart was knitted to that spirit.
[time=2735] Has there ever been someone whose heart was knitted to your heart, their spirit?
[time=2740] One day Jesus Christ walked by a body of water, and he said, "Come, and I'll make you fishers of men." One day Jesus had taken up the cross and followed me, and there was just something about that man that attracted their spirit.
[time=2756] I had grown up in church.
[time=2758] I knew the Bible verses like many of you, and I didn't want to be a phony.
[time=2762] I didn't want to just go through church.
[time=2764] But there was something attractive about Jesus.
[time=2769] I never wanted to mock him.
[time=2771] There was something about him, something about Jesus.
[time=2776] And you're here today, and there may be that attraction.
[time=2779] When he says, "Come, follow me.
[time=2783] Come, and I'll give you life, and I'll give you life abundantly."
[time=2789] Within that text, the attraction of spirit brings us to our next quality.
[time=2794] Not only is there an attraction of spirit, but we find that there must be an investment that is made.
[time=2800] Notice if you will, in verse 4.
[time=2802] And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and he gave it to David and his garments,
[time=2809] even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle.
[time=2813] It says that Jonathan took off his robe.
[time=2816] That robe was his kingly robe.
[time=2819] He was a prince, and his robe identified his position in life.
[time=2825] And Jonathan took a piece of great value, this robe, and he placed it on David's shoulders.
[time=2834] If you're going to have a friend, there's an attraction of spirit, and I believe there must also be an investment of value.
[time=2844] Something that you value, you must invest in that other person.
[time=2849] To show that person, they have value.
[time=2853] When I first went to college, I listened to our college president, Dr. Edmund speaking chapel, and he identified his wife and his pet dog in the strange way.
[time=2863] He called his wife, friend wife, and he called his dog, brown dog.
[time=2868] And I thought to myself as a student, what a strange way to talk about your wife.
[time=2873] I mean, this man's supposed to be a college president, and he doesn't even know her name, friend wife.
[time=2880] As the years have gone by, that term friend has become very precious.
[time=2886] For I have discovered there's a value in that person.
[time=2890] Someone who will share the heartaches, the disappointments, the joys, the excitements, friend wife has become a very meaningful term.
[time=2899] I still don't understand brown dog, but I do know that friend wife is a beautiful term.
[time=2905] But you see in a relationship of husband and wife, they'll never be friendship, if there's no sense of worth.
[time=2912] If our wives are only attractive to us because the attraction is physical and not to their spirit, they'll never have worth.
[time=2920] But if we sense their worth, you make an investment, an investment of value, and that value is to give them worth.
[time=2929] Your husband will never feel worth if he's just someone who earns money.
[time=2934] Your wife will never have value if she's just a housekeeper, but does the person have worth?
[time=2940] Your child, does he have worth? Your father, your mother, do they have worth?
[time=2945] It's an investment of value to give them worth.
[time=2949] You see David received not only a robe, David received a very special gift of worth.
[time=2955] It says that he gave to him his sword.
[time=2958] In 1 Samuel chapter 13 it tells us there were only two men with swords, Saul and Jonathan.
[time=2964] The Philistines had the privilege of the blacksmiths, so Israel did not have swords.
[time=2971] Only two. You talk about a precious commodity too.
[time=2976] And Jonathan took that precious sword and he gave it to David.
[time=2983] If you're going to have a friend, you're going to have to make an investment of value, of worth, of time, of money, of even money.
[time=2995] Where your treasure is, that's where your heart is. Jesus saw his disciples and he said, "I love you. You have worth. Come follow me and I'll make you fishers of men.
[time=3006] Come follow me and I'll give you a life that is truly abundant.
[time=3010] Follow me." But he made an investment. He was rich, became poor. He made an investment.
[time=3016] He said, "I'm willing to lay down my life." He made an investment.
[time=3023] You've heard the story of churches that raise money. Just one particular church.
[time=3027] The pastor said, "We have to raise money this week. We're in this building program and this week we need cash." So therefore I'm going to ask that as God lays it upon someone's heart to have the great privilege this week to give us cash, will you sell your car?
[time=3040] Sell your car and give that cash to the church building program this week. Now who would like to do that?
[time=3047] No one raised their hand. He said, "I know you're just waiting for each other. You don't want to take honor from somebody else." But now we do need someone to sell their car this week. Who'll do that?
[time=3056] No one raised their hand. He said, "I know you're just holding back because you don't want to be honored this morning in front of people and being a public."
[time=3065] But he said, "I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to take this feather and I'm going to go up into the balcony and I'm going to just let this feather go."
[time=3073] And on whose head the feather falls, we'll know that's the one that God wants to sell their car and give the money to the church.
[time=3083] So the pastor took the feather, walked up into the balcony, threw it out over the ledge, and the next sound heard in that church for some time was this.
[time=3093] You understood it quite well.
[time=3100] Oftentimes in our lives we don't want to make an investment of value, but if we're going to have a friend, it takes an investment of value.
[time=3112] If we really want to build a church, it takes an investment of value. That's what's building this church.
[time=3118] You have made an investment that costs you something and God is honoring it.
[time=3123] Not only is there an investment of value, I believe there's communication of real depth.
[time=3128] They didn't just talk about ball games. They didn't just talk about the scores of the Philistines and the Israelites.
[time=3134] They talked about real issues. They talked about their family. They talked about their feelings. They talked about the future.
[time=3141] And a friend can talk about their feelings. A friend can even correct even the faithful wounds of a friend are far more precious than the kisses of an enemy.
[time=3151] Oil and perfume are pleasant to our nostrils, but the counsel of a friend is sweeter than all of those.
[time=3159] Oh, a loyal, strengthening, counseling friend is a precious commodity. You share deeply. You share truth. You share feelings. You share counsel.
[time=3173] And a friend. And a friend is one that we also are not ashamed of.
[time=3179] There's an attraction of spirit. There's an investment of value. There's a communication of depth.
[time=3187] And there is, I believe, a willingness to publicly identify with that friend.
[time=3194] Jonathan took off his robe and put it on David publicly.
[time=3200] Jonathan verbally said, "I make an oath." That's what these verses say.
[time=3207] There was a covenant made between them for it says that Jonathan in verse three loved him as he loved his own soul and he made a covenant verbal and visual.
[time=3218] They grasped arms together and verbally, "I promise, I promise to honor you, protect you to be your friend.
[time=3229] I will even sit by you, but I'll give my life." They made that promise and they did it publicly.
[time=3237] Have you ever publicly told your friend how valuable they are to you?
[time=3242] Have you ever made a public identity with them? Have you ever recognized that even in Jesus Christ he came and publicly became man?
[time=3252] He said, "I love you. You are my friends." Do you know many people think this is a dirty story?
[time=3258] That David and Jonathan had a love that was greater than the love of women and it's a dirty story.
[time=3263] It is not a dirty story. Jesus said there is no greater love than the love of a man who lays down his life for his friends.
[time=3274] This is not some kind of a perverted story. This great love was willing to publicly lay down life and give words in direction and identity.
[time=3287] Have you ever publicly identified with Jesus Christ? Have you ever verbally said, "I want Christ Jesus to live in my heart? I'm a sinner.
[time=3297] Come into my life. I want you to be my Lord." Have you ever visually made it known in your life that you're a follower of Jesus Christ?
[time=3309] My dad brought home a baseball. He said, "Dave, I've got a hard ball here for you. It wasn't a mush ball or a big soft ball. It was a real baseball."
[time=3319] He said, "Now, I'm going to give you this ball, but one condition. Don't go playing on any corner lots. Play with this ball only up at the playground. It goes a long way.
[time=3330] It'll break something. Play only on the playground." Okay, dad. A couple of weeks went by and my friends came to the house one day and said, "Dave, come on. Let's go up the corner lot here. We've got a group of guys. We're going to play ball up there."
[time=3343] And I said, "Up the corner lot. I can't play up there with my baseball. All we need you to bring the baseball. I said, "I can only play on the playground. Oh, come on. Everybody's up there. Nothing's going to happen. Everybody's waiting up there. Your friends are up there."
[time=3356] I went up to the corner lot. Have you ever played Sandlot baseball? It's great. We must have been playing before 90,000 people that day. I mean, we just made up the game in our mind. It's exciting.
[time=3368] And in the midst of that excitement, that ball came across the plate shoulder high. I ripped into that ball with that bat and hit it and it went like a missile.
[time=3378] A missile with radar because that thing took off and it was heading toward a picture window across the street. Big picture window.
[time=3388] And right in the middle of that window, that baseball hit it, splattered it, splintered it into 1,001 pieces. That ball didn't hit the carpet before I was home.
[time=3401] I was home, locked in my house. I was in trouble, real trouble. I didn't go near that house. I didn't deliver my papers or help anywhere near that house.
[time=3414] A week later, my father said, "David, I'd like to talk to you. Where's your baseball?" "My baseball. I made up the biggest lie you've ever heard."
[time=3424] He said, "Well, I wondered where your baseball was." I said, "Why did you ask?" He said, "Well, I wondered where your baseball was because Mr. Stein just called and said there's a baseball in his living room with your name on it."
[time=3438] "I've learned something. Don't ever put your name on a baseball."
[time=3445] "Well, I had to go up and apologize," my father said. He said, "Why did you disobey me?" I said, "My friends told me."
[time=3452] He said, "They're not your friends if they tell you to disobey your father."
[time=3458] "You won't go up and apologize." I got there, started to knock and I looked and there was my dad behind me. I was trembling.
[time=3465] I said, "Mr. Stein, I'm sorry I broke your window." He said, "Why did you run?" I said, "I was scared and I was just shaking."
[time=3472] All of a sudden, my dad came up and he put his arm around my shoulder and he said, "Mr. Stein, I'm sorry." He said, "I know that you're of the Jewish faith." He said, "I'm a Christian." He said, "I'm sorry my son broke your window and ran. He'll pay for it. He will."
[time=3487] I was glad my dad was there, but I didn't know how I'd pay for it.
[time=3491] I got back down the steps and I said, "I don't know how I'll pay for it," he said, "David, you're a paper boy's helper, aren't you?"
[time=3497] I said, "That's right. I mean, that's as low on the wage scale as you can go." He said, "But you don't deliver it." Perhaps today you are coming to the same conclusion I did when David spoke to me 18 years ago.
[time=3516] And that is that I needed to accept Christ as my Savior.
[time=3520] If you'd like to open up your heart to the Lord right now, I would like to lead you in a simple prayer to do so.
[time=3527] Lord Jesus, I realize today that I am a sinner in need of a Savior.
[time=3533] I believe you are the Son of God and that you died on the cross for my sins.
[time=3539] Please come into my heart and save me. Amen.
[time=3545] If you made that simple prayer, that decision today, we would like to send you this booklet called "Your Decision"
[time=3551] to help you to begin to grow in your Christian life.
