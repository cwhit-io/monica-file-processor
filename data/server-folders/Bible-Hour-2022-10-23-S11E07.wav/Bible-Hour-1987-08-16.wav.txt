[time=90] Proverbs 22 one says that a good name is better than great riches.
[time=98] Throughout history, a few names have become known for the character of the men.
[time=102] In the life of Julius Caesar, there was a friend who turned traitor, and now the name Brutus stands for the individual who is unfaithful.
[time=113] But also in history, there was a man by the name of Joseph who was faithful.
[time=118] He was so faithful that they renamed him Barnabas, son of encouragement.
[time=125] Brutus are Barnabas.
[time=128] Faithful or unfaithful? What is in a name?
[time=134] Your name? What does it mean?
[time=137] How will your name be remembered in history?

[time=153] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoggs.
[time=156] Thank you for joining us.
[time=158] Rick's message today is taken from Proverbs chapter 22 and is entitled, "Managing Our Reputation." What is your name?
[time=168] What did you name your children?
[time=170] How did you select those names?
[time=172] Often, we pass on family names, or sometimes the names of a friend.
[time=177] In the Old Testament, a name actually represented the character of the individual.
[time=182] A man guarded his name, or it was identification of his person and his reputation.
[time=188] Abraham Lincoln was known as Honest Abe.
[time=192] Benedict Arnold was known as a traitor.
[time=194] What is it you are known as?
[time=197] "Managing Your Reputation" is our study today from Proverbs.
[time=201] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=205] Our text is Proverbs chapter 22 verse 1.
[time=209] Our special music today is brought to us by celebration.
[time=215] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hogg Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=224] I pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.

[time=552] We are the chosen ones from whom the Savior died. We are the church with every day. We are the soldiers of the cross. We are the church.
[time=572] We are the church. We are the church. We are the church.
[time=602] Thank you, celebration. In the weeks that we've been gone from Black Hawk, we've had the privilege of worshiping in churches on the West Coast, having a wonderful time observing them and worshiping together with them.
[time=614] You pull in and we had different size churches, different types of buildings, but you soon realize that the church are the people.
[time=622] And the response that we had was based upon the response of those people and worshiping the Lord. And it's great to have a great family of believers here at Black Hawk that give that feeling of, "Wow, I'm glad I'm here. I'm glad I have the opportunity to live in Fort Wayne and worship here at Black Hawk Baptist Church."
[time=640] Well, let's continue with a great song of affirmation. "Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. Him number 51 will sing all three verses. Him number 51."
[time=662] "Shore and Jesus is mine. Oh what a poor taste the glory divine."
[time=672] There is salvation, the church of God, Lord and its spirit. This is my glory. This is my song. Raising my Savior all the day long. This is my story.
[time=700] Take my Savior all the day long. Perfect image on perfect line. This is a matter of numbers from my side.
[time=718] Hanging, standing, ring from above. Your Father will receive this first song.
[time=730] This is my story. This is my song. Raising my Savior all the day long. This is my story. This is my song.
[time=747] Raising my Savior all the day long. Perfect image on all these events. I am my Savior and happy and blessed.
[time=767] Watching, waiting, looking all gone. This is my glory. This is my song. Raising my Savior all the day long.
[time=791] This is my story. This is my song. Take my Savior all the day long.
[time=806] And we continue to praise the Lord now as celebration sings for us. Worship is a celebration and we sing now of the holiness of the Lord. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=836] Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=859] Holy in the morning our song shall rise to thee. Holy, holy, holy.
[time=879] Merciful and light sweet, God in reverse sense, blessed me.
[time=896] Holy, holy, holy. All the saints adore thee, casting down their golden crowns around
[time=924] The glass is seen, share of him and share of him, falling down before thee.
[time=943] You were dead, and all dead, evermore shall be.
[time=973] Holy, holy, holy. Holy, holy, holy. All the darkness I need.
[time=994] Holy, I have sinned all man, by glory may I see.
[time=1007] Holy, our glory, there is none beside me.
[time=1021] Perfecting glory, love and purity.
[time=1051] Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=1067] Holy, holy, holy, holy. All my words shall free-sign him in earth and sky and sea.
[time=1088] Holy, holy, holy. Merciful and light sweet, God in reverse sense, blessed me.
[time=1114] Holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=1154] It is such a privilege for us to have the opportunity to share the ministry of music and God's word with you today.
[time=1162] Thank you so much for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=1165] We have back with us our minister of music and close friend Peter Coby. I'm glad you had such a good trip to the West Coast to visit your family. Welcome home.
[time=1174] Thank you, Rick. It was really a great time, but it's nice to be back in Blackhawk when you say I was glad when they said let us go into the house of the Lord. It's good to go into the house of the Lord in Fort Wayne.
[time=1184] Well, you made it all the way to the West Coast, but how many miles did you go in total?
[time=1188] Well, round trip, we went about 7,200 miles. Good grief. We started in Oregon and had a chance to visit several churches that we wanted to visit, one of which was a concert with the masters such a former music group that I had, and they're starting their eighth year of ministry, and it was a blessing to be with those young people.
[time=1207] Then we went down into California to Modesto area, the first Baptist church where Dr. Yeager is the pastor, and then the Grace Community Church in Big Valley, which is also the Modesto area where David Seifert is the pastor.
[time=1220] Then we had the privilege of going down to L.A. and visiting Grace Community Church where Dr. John MacArthur is the pastor in the evening service we heard Bob Vernon, who's the assistant chief police of the L.A. police department.
[time=1232] That was a wonderful time to visit family and also visit some churches.
[time=1236] Oh, it sounds like a neat trip. We missed you. We were glad you had such a good time, but we're glad you're home.
[time=1241] Thank you. Looking forward to next week when we have a special music guest here at Black Hawk.
[time=1246] Yes, Rick. We've given the choir a day off, and that's been great, but we have some special music that's coming, and Brenda Whitfield is coming.
[time=1256] She's a local person right here in one of our black churches. She has sung in our Christian school several times, and I've been very impressed every time she's come, and I asked her months ago to come here in the summer and just really minister to us.
[time=1268] It'll be a unique program, and we want to invite you to come next Sunday to our service, and then she'll be giving a concert in the evening.
[time=1275] Oh, Brenda's a joy to be around. It's been a great privilege to have her here, and to have her singing as you mentioned in the school, and she is just a delightful person, and we're looking forward to next Sunday when Brenda comes and ministers to us in song.
[time=1290] On Thursday nights in August, our summer Bible conference continues right now by way of film, and we have Tim Timmons speaking about maximum life and being hooked on life.
[time=1302] This last week we saw the first film. It was excellent. It challenged us to really look at our life and to see where our commitments are, and I know the next three films will be just as exciting, and we want to encourage you to come on Thursday nights for the summer Bible Conference right here at Blackhawk.
[time=1319] Then Peter Change took place while you were gone with timeless insights. We've been offering you timeless insights often over the past years, and there's one slight change, and that is timeless insights now has a new name. It's called a closer walk, and that describes so well the relationship that God wants to have with us.
[time=1340] That is a close, intimate walk with Christ, and there's only one way that's possible. That's through the daily discipline of being in God's Word and being in prayer.
[time=1352] As a matter of fact, in this one copy of Closer Walk, it gives an introductory article called Basic Training.
[time=1359] Many of you men and perhaps even some of the women have been a part of our military service, and you know that basic training is essential to preparing you to serve in the military.
[time=1369] Well, there's some basics of the Christian life, some fundamental training that each of us need in order to have a close walk with God, and this booklet will help you to have those basic fundamentals in place.
[time=1384] They are studying the Scripture, and Closer Walk will take you through the entire New Testament in one year's time, giving you great insight and application of the Word of God.
[time=1396] It will also begin to form in your life a daily habit of training that's needed for each one of us. We'd love to send you a copy if you would simply write and ask for a closer walk, or if you forget and say timeless insights, we'll know exactly what you mean.
[time=1411] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Ask for the booklet Closer Walk through the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1431] Peter, welcome back, and to each of you, welcome today as we open up our hearts to God as He speaks to us in song and in the message that we're going to be sharing from Proverbs.
[time=1442] I've been looking forward to this Sunday in a special way. David spoke here last week, and that was a delight, but I missed a week of preaching, so I got twice as much for you today, and my heart's full thanks for the privilege of teaching you today.
[time=1461] [MUSIC]
[time=1465] [singing] [singing] The eyes of the world are crying, sorrow is an old familiar too.
[time=1488] But with the light in our eyes, we can shine through the dark. There is so much that we can do.
[time=1505] In His name, His name, we can dry the child's tears, come the widow's feet in His name.
[time=1522] In His name, His name, we can be those who are hungry. Listen to the lonely in His name, it is made.
[time=1542] [MUSIC]
[time=1547] He is the vine, we are branches. The power that we have comes from Him.
[time=1559] It comes from Him, and it is His life we live. It is His love we give.
[time=1570] Apart from Him, we are just men. In His name, His name, we can dry the child's tears, come the widow's feet.
[time=1588] He is in His name. In His name, His name, we can be those who are hungry. Listen to the lonely in His name.
[time=1609] [singing]
[time=1618] In His name, in His name, we'll move the darkest mountain.
[time=1628] Love will flow like fountain. In His name, His name.
[time=1644] In His name, His name, we can dry the child's tears, come the widow's feet.
[time=1657] [singing]
[time=1663] In His name, His name, we can be those who are hungry. Listen to the lonely in His name.
[time=1679] In His name, His name. In His name.
[time=1706] Our God, we come to You today in His name, the name of Jesus. That name given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[time=1716] We come today to bow our hearts and our heads and to confess with our mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=1724] God, we worship You today and we are not ashamed of the name of Jesus. We love Him and we thank You for the undescribable gift of His life sacrificed for our eternal life.
[time=1738] And we come in His name to worship and to pray. And God in the name of Jesus today, we pray for those today who are suffering.
[time=1749] We pray for Mike and Faye Bloodgood as they have had a hope deferred the heart sickened at the depth of the loss of a child.
[time=1758] God, as they have anticipated for these five months a baby and then to give birth to a child and for it to die, God, the hearts are heavy.
[time=1767] And in the name of Jesus, we ask You to comfort today. We ask You to wrap your arms about them and to strengthen them.
[time=1777] God, we come to You today in the name of Jesus asking You to work in our hearts today that we might walk in obedience to Your Word.
[time=1787] That as a watching world sees us bearing the name of Christ one's Christians, that we'd walk worthy of Your name.
[time=1796] Father today, we pray for our Dean Marker as she battles cancer.
[time=1803] We pray for Hannah Stettler as she fights for her health.
[time=1807] And for Marv Degas and Marv Eastland as they chronically go through battles for strength.
[time=1813] God, we ask You in the name of Jesus to give strength to those who are suffering.
[time=1818] Father, as we study Your Word today, we pray that there would have in our hearts a clarity of understanding that in the name of Jesus,
[time=1829] there is not only power, but there is responsibility to be obeyed.
[time=1834] For it is in His name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1841] What is in a name?
[time=1844] Three men walk together through a familiar setting, the halls of the Senate of Rome.
[time=1850] It is the 15th of March.
[time=1853] Three men who had been friends in life, Caesar, Cassius in Brutus.
[time=1860] But suddenly the three turn into a mob and the mobs around Caesar, and with daggers they stab him repeatedly.
[time=1868] And in His dying breath, Julius Caesar says, "Ettubrutte, even you, Brutus, my friend, Brutus, Ettubrutte, even you."
[time=1890] A young American military officer weighs the events of the Revolutionary War.
[time=1896] He fears defeat by Britain, but his greater fear is that the French and the Indians will attack again,
[time=1903] and they'll fall subject not to the British, but to the French.
[time=1908] Regardless of his motive, he conspires to betray the American army, and Benedict Arnold gives the information to the British.
[time=1920] Benedict Arnold, Brutus, the name of traitors.
[time=1928] The 13 men assemble in a solitary room.
[time=1932] The 13 of them are bounded together by their love for one, and the love of that one for them is overwhelming.
[time=1939] He humbles himself, he washes their feet, he calls them his family, and then he says, "But one of you will betray me."
[time=1949] Brutus, Brutus, Benedict, Brutus, three names out of the pages of history.
[time=1961] The average student will know all three names, and at the hearing of each name, there is the quick synonym, deceiver, traitor, Brutus, Benedict.
[time=1978] Brutus, the name of a traitor.
[time=1983] What is in a name?
[time=1986] If you have your Bible today, I invite you to open it to Proverbs.
[time=1990] We'll be studying a theme in Proverbs that is founded in its root in Proverbs 22, verse 1.
[time=1997] Solomon is writing to his son. He will leave his son a legacy.
[time=2002] He will leave him not only a legacy of wealth and of treasure, he'll leave him not only the legacy of a kingdom, but he wants to leave him a legacy that will guide him.
[time=2012] And so Solomon pens these proverbial, timeless words of wisdom collected into one book we call Proverbs.
[time=2022] Proverbs 22, verse 1, this insight for living.
[time=2028] A good name is more desirable than great riches.
[time=2033] To be esteemed is better than silver or gold.
[time=2038] A good name is more desirable than great riches.
[time=2044] In our lives pursuit, we each have an occupation.
[time=2048] That occupation has as its incentive and its motivation, a reward.
[time=2053] Silver and gold. Money that is necessary, that is not in and of itself evil, but money that can become a God that can become a consuming force.
[time=2063] And as desirable as it may seem, there is something more desirable than financial success.
[time=2069] It is the success of integrity of a good name.
[time=2074] Proverbs 10, 7 puts it in this way. The memory of the righteous will live on, but the name of the wicked will rot.
[time=2087] What is in a name?
[time=2090] You know, it's interesting how we got our names.
[time=2093] Most of us received our first names because somebody in our family had that name and it was passed on.
[time=2099] Our mother and father just always liked that name.
[time=2103] And they said, "If we ever have a little boy, we'll name him Adam."
[time=2109] You like that name? So you take it.
[time=2112] It's all right.
[time=2114] But in antiquity, names came in a different way.
[time=2117] Did you ever wonder how you got your last name?
[time=2120] You know, it wasn't until the 1100s that in the European culture there were last names.
[time=2125] There were first names, there were David's and there were John's and there were Dale's and there were Jim's.
[time=2131] There were Linda's and there were Carol's and there were Joanne's.
[time=2134] But that's all the name there was.
[time=2137] But as population centers began to grow more than just little villages, there would often be two or three David's or John's or Carol's or Diane.
[time=2146] And there needed to be a way to distinguish them.
[time=2150] And so they came up with not last names but distinguishing identifications.
[time=2156] For example, there might be in one village quite a few John's and so how do you describe this John or this David?
[time=2164] Well, this particular David may be a man who worked with metal and a man who worked with metal was called a Smith.
[time=2172] And so you would talk about David the Smith and it got shortened to David Smith.
[time=2179] Or you may have been a man who worked with wood and you formed things with wood and you were a carpenter.
[time=2185] We've got carpenters in our church and that David would be distinguished from the other David's by David the carpenter.
[time=2193] Or if you made something, if you were a craftsman and you made something, you would be called a right.
[time=2200] We've got lots of rights in our church. They're not always right but their name is right.
[time=2205] Now, a right was somebody who made something so we've got a Dale right.
[time=2209] That means Dale is a craftsman who made something.
[time=2212] Now, if you made something in particular, they might say, well, you make carts.
[time=2217] So you're a cartwright and you live out on the Ponderosa and that's how they distinguished you.
[time=2222] You were a cart maker. You might be David the cart maker.
[time=2226] It was a description of what that person did by way of occupation.
[time=2231] Or it might be a relationship.
[time=2234] For example, there might be a lot of David's and you're trying to describe the David to distinguish him from all other David's and you say,
[time=2241] well, as father is John, you know, David Johnson.
[time=2244] And that's where the name Johnson came from.
[time=2247] Or you might have been somebody like a Dale Svensson.
[time=2252] You come from Sweden and you were Sven's son and they called you that Svensson.
[time=2257] That's where those names came from, by your relationship to someone else.
[time=2262] Or it might be of the very description of the first person who bore your last name.
[time=2267] Somebody in the ancestry of Longfellow was a longfellow and they named him.
[time=2275] You know the longfellow and that name stuck in history.
[time=2281] Well, it might be by location.
[time=2283] It might be that you were the David that came from the small community of Brown.
[time=2288] They became David Brown and names have been given to us because they began to do something that described the person.
[time=2298] My last name is Hawks.
[time=2301] My wife's maiden name was Bird.
[time=2303] Do you know what that means?
[time=2304] That means we're a flighty family.
[time=2306] Somebody in our background just didn't have it all level.
[time=2310] Okay, that's where names came from.
[time=2313] Now, why is that important? Because Solomon says a good name is more valuable than financial success.
[time=2325] In the Hebrew culture, like in the 1100s, a name was often given to describe character.
[time=2333] A variety of sources would give birth to a name but often an individual was given a name at birth so as to shape his character.
[time=2342] Let me give you four ways the Hebrews often named their children.
[time=2346] Here's the first way in one of the most common ways.
[time=2348] They named their children something that described their God.
[time=2353] Micah is simply a compound of Hebrew words that means this.
[time=2357] Who is like the Lord?
[time=2359] So as a little boy would grow up and they would call him Micah and he would hear that name.
[time=2364] He would be reminded that there is a God who is different than every other God.
[time=2369] Who is like him? No one.
[time=2372] And a young boy would grow up with a confidence that there's a God in heaven who is undescribable.
[time=2381] Zephaniah speaks also of the character of God.
[time=2386] It means the Lord protects and as a young boy would grow up he would hear his name Zephaniah
[time=2393] and he would have within his own heart a confidence that he could trust God that God would protect.
[time=2400] Zechariah the Lord remembers.
[time=2404] Although you may be going through that valley today don't ever forget God remembers.
[time=2411] You can trust him truth and time go hand in hand.
[time=2415] And so when a young man or a young lady was given a name it was given to them that they would have a concept of God
[time=2422] and then that name was given them as a trust.
[time=2426] That is they bore that name they were trusted to represent the God whose name they carried.
[time=2432] And so to honor your name was so important.
[time=2436] It was more important that you honor your name than you ever be successful in any other adventure in life.
[time=2443] Hebrews also gave their children names because of the circumstances are the event of their birth.
[time=2449] Hannah had prayed for a son she had prayed to the point where people thought she's muttering she's drunk.
[time=2457] She wasn't drunk she wasn't muttering she was praying and she said oh God would you give me a son?
[time=2464] And God heard her pray and she named her son Samuel because Samuel means Shama here L God.
[time=2474] God hears and a little boy by the name of Samuel would grow up when he would hear his name he'd be reminded that God hears.
[time=2485] And throughout his life that was the description of his life that Samuel could talk to God and God would hear him.
[time=2494] It was a description of the events of birth.
[time=2498] At other times God would give a name to a parent to give to a child because it was to be prophetic.
[time=2505] There came a point in Israel's history where they had so sinned that God said you're not going to be my people anymore.
[time=2513] And he called a prophet by the name of Hosea and Hosea had a wife by the name of Gomer.
[time=2518] They gave birth to a second son and God said name that son lo ami lo not ami my people not my people.
[time=2528] And that young boy was a living testimony that God prophesied you're no longer my people the Assyrians will take you away.
[time=2538] There's a lot more to a name than just the way that it sounds.
[time=2543] There are times also that a name was given later in life because the person earned that name.
[time=2552] There is a man who were introduced to one time in the scriptures for Samuel 25 25.
[time=2559] His name is Nabal and his wife in apologizing to David says his name is Nabal and he is as his name a fool.
[time=2569] Now no mother names their little baby, fool.
[time=2573] Now you may think that but you don't do that.
[time=2576] But what happened in this man's life is that his character was that of a fool and it came to the point where people simply called him what he was.
[time=2584] He was a fool.
[time=2586] Names.
[time=2587] How did we get our names?
[time=2589] They're so important to God.
[time=2592] Oh my name Richard Hawks has no biblical significance but the significance will come as I live my life.
[time=2601] The significance will come to your name as you live your life.
[time=2606] Bret Hart the the chronology of the Old West in his short stories said this that a man's name was his bond.
[time=2615] That a man either had character and if he gave his name you trusted him and if a man's name did not have character he was not trusted.
[time=2626] Your name.
[time=2628] How will it be remembered?
[time=2632] Solomon said to a son trying to guide him and to give him wisdom.
[time=2636] My son guard your name it is better to have a good name than great riches.
[time=2645] Well in the book of Proverbs it gives us seven qualities of a man or a woman with a good name.
[time=2652] Certainly there are more than seven to be discussed but out of the book of Proverbs we discover the reoccurrence of these key words.
[time=2659] Name, honor, reputation and respect and praise.
[time=2665] And as you study those words you begin to discover the qualities that God says are praise worthy that bring honor to a name.
[time=2673] Allow me to give you those seven today.
[time=2675] The first is found in Proverbs chapter three.
[time=2678] Proverbs three verse thirteen through verse sixteen.
[time=2684] It says blessed is the man who finds wisdom.
[time=2689] The man who gains understanding for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.
[time=2698] She is more precious than rubies.
[time=2700] Nothing you desire can compare with her.
[time=2704] Long life or in her right hand and in her left hand are riches and honor.
[time=2712] This passage parallels Proverbs twenty two one in two ways.
[time=2716] First of all it speaks of metaphysical wealth.
[time=2719] Wealth that is intangible wealth that is something that is real but yet you cannot touch it.
[time=2726] It says in Proverbs twenty two there is a wealth in a good name in Proverbs three it says there is wealth in wisdom.
[time=2734] And it says in Proverbs twenty two a good name brings honor.
[time=2738] It says in Proverbs three wisdom brings honor.
[time=2744] Each of us as we grow older we think of the time of our life when we will no longer be here.
[time=2753] And we think of provision for children and often provision for grandchildren.
[time=2757] What will we leave them?
[time=2759] Will we leave them in a state?
[time=2761] Will we be able to provide something that will secure their future?
[time=2764] Maybe we would be able to provide an education for grandchildren.
[time=2768] What will we be able to leave them?
[time=2771] One man in our church has a heart of wisdom.
[time=2776] He has been successful as a businessman.
[time=2778] There is no doubt of that. He can leave a legacy to the next generations of finances.
[time=2784] But he's left them a greater legacy.
[time=2787] He has taken the time to put on tape messages to his grandchildren.
[time=2793] He goes on tape and he says I love you.
[time=2796] And I live here in Fort Wayne and you live way over there and I don't get to see you.
[time=2801] But I love you and I want to tell you some things.
[time=2805] And he records verses of scripture.
[time=2808] He said just let me read to you the scriptures now that have shaped my life.
[time=2812] And then he says to a grandson oh study the scriptures.
[time=2817] Make them a light under your feet and a lamp on your path.
[time=2821] And then he sings a song, a godly legacy.
[time=2825] And now those grandchildren long after grandpa is gone they will remember his name.
[time=2832] Oh I'm sure they'll remember the finances that he leaves.
[time=2835] But they'll remember a spiritual legacy of wisdom that has passed down from generation to generation.
[time=2844] How will your grandchildren remember your name?
[time=2847] What will you leave for them as a remembrance of you?
[time=2851] I remember my grandfather. He lived in our home.
[time=2854] He was debilitated with arthritis. The legs did not move.
[time=2858] But I remember his hands.
[time=2861] His hands could fix anything and I remember a workbench.
[time=2865] And he gave me a legacy of working with my hands.
[time=2870] What legacy will you give your children and your grandchildren?
[time=2875] Will you give them the legacy of a good name that is marked by wisdom?
[time=2880] There is a second quality that comes that is the quality of integrity.
[time=2885] It is found repeatedly. Proverbs 12, 22. Proverbs 16, 13.
[time=2890] Proverbs 19, 22. Proverbs 37 to 8.
[time=2895] It speaks of a name. Proverbs 16 verse 13.
[time=2899] Kings take pleasure in honest lips.
[time=2903] And they value a man who speaks the truth.
[time=2909] A man who speaks the truth.
[time=2913] Proverbs 13 verse 7 and 8.
[time=2917] Two things I ask of you O God, do not refuse me before I die.
[time=2921] Keep falsehood and lies far from me.
[time=2924] Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.
[time=2928] Otherwise I may have too much in disown you and say, "Who is the Lord, or I may become poor and still and so dishonor the name of thy God?"
[time=2942] Integrity honors a name.
[time=2947] That is why it is so important that you not only guard your name with integrity,
[time=2954] but as Proverbs 30 says, "We guard the name of our God."
[time=2961] You see, today when you carry that name, Christian, what the name Christian means, it means Christ ones, ones who are like Christ.
[time=2971] And a watching world observes a name of Christ.
[time=2975] They have not seen him, but they have seen you, they have seen me, and they shape their concept of Christ by the ones who carry his name.
[time=2985] Do you carry it with integrity?
[time=2989] A third concept, kindness.
[time=2994] Proverbs 11, verse 16 says, "A kind, hearted woman gains respect."
[time=3004] Would you be respected today?
[time=3006] Management books come out and they talk about the tough-minded manager, and there has to be a discipline, there has to be a toughness, but we need to be, as one person called it, a velvet-covered brick.
[time=3020] Boy, we land, but it's a soft landing.
[time=3024] Kindness.
[time=3026] You know, the Scripture says that kindness is to so mark our lives, that when it comes to a choice of being taken, or to winning the case, or to give, or to be kind,
[time=3042] it is better to lose the case than to lose the person,
[time=3048] where to be kind.
[time=3050] It gains respect, it gains a good name.
[time=3054] A fourth quality, two verses I will like to marry together.
[time=3058] The first is found in Proverbs 13 and verse 18.
[time=3063] It says, "He who ignores discipline comes to poverty and to shame,
[time=3070] but he who heeds correction is honored." In contrast, Proverbs 28, verse 23 says, "He who rebukes a man in the end will gain more favor than he who has a flattering tongue." A fourth quality that earns respect for a name is to accept
[time=3094] and to give correction.
[time=3097] Proverbs 13, except correction.
[time=3100] Proverbs 28, give correction, both of course require tact and diplomacy, but to the ability to accept correction.
[time=3110] Amongst musicians and athletes, there are two kinds that exceed.
[time=3115] There are those that simply have the raw ability.
[time=3118] Some of you have raw athletic ability.
[time=3120] Somebody can put a tennis racket in your hand, they can show you how to grip it, they can show you the swing forehand and backhand and you've got it down.
[time=3129] You can go play tennis today.
[time=3131] Others of you can be shown and you can be given tennis lessons and you put that racket in your hand and you strike out and you get home runs.
[time=3139] You either miss the ball completely or you knock it over the net, over the court, over the fence and down the hill.
[time=3145] There's just no natural ability that is there.
[time=3149] My wife, I don't think she's here this hour, so I can tell this, she has no natural athletic ability.
[time=3156] Second date, we went to play tennis.
[time=3159] She was frustrated, she says, "Why don't you hit the ball to me?" I said, "Well, there are these two lines, I'm supposed to hit him in between those lines away from you, I don't want to play."
[time=3171] She wanted to stand there and just kind of bump it over and I'd bump it back and if it didn't go close, where she'd have to run for, she'd just take another ball and bump it over, that's no natural ability.
[time=3183] She married a guy when it came to music.
[time=3186] He has no natural ability.
[time=3189] We'll be singing along in the car and I'll be thundering out on my t-port and all of a sudden she'll go, "Change keys three times." I didn't know that, that sounded pretty good to me.
[time=3202] You know, you're in that car and the glass windows are up the top just echoes and I have all this resonance because the windows are up, you roll down the windows, I have none.
[time=3211] I got no natural music ability.
[time=3214] She's got it, I don't.
[time=3216] But there are others who succeed.
[time=3218] They may not have natural ability, but you know what they have?
[time=3221] They have a teachable heart.
[time=3225] You may not be able to succeed in many areas of life, unnatural ability, but do you have a teachable heart?
[time=3233] You see, you can take one that does not have natural ability, but if they have a teachable heart, you can show them, you can instruct them and they can learn.
[time=3243] But Proverbs says a man with a good name has to be one that has a teachable heart who is willing to accept correction.
[time=3253] How well do you do at that?
[time=3256] You will make mistakes.
[time=3259] No one is perfect, but will you learn from those mistakes?
[time=3263] Can someone say a word of correction without you being devastated and making them feel guilty that they spoke the truth in love?
[time=3271] Can you be corrected?
[time=3273] Can you give a word of correction?
[time=3276] Proverbs 28 says in the long run, it is the one who rebukes,
[time=3283] not the one who flatters that you love.
[time=3287] You know, I enjoy preaching.
[time=3289] You probably noticed that.
[time=3290] That's why it gets long here every once in a while.
[time=3292] But you are so encouraging.
[time=3294] Some of you are so kind that you come by and you tell me what a good message it was even though you slept through the whole thing.
[time=3301] You nodded off just as Sue was singing the high part in his name and you woke up when you heard the people next to you stand up for the invitation, but you'll come out the door and you'll say, oh, that was a good message.
[time=3312] Flattery.
[time=3313] I like it.
[time=3314] Go ahead.
[time=3315] Keep doing it.
[time=3316] But you know, the real man of character is the one who
[time=3322] graciously can speak the truth in love and who will not tell you
[time=3328] what you want to hear but what you need to know.
[time=3331] They're the ones who will help you in the long run.
[time=3335] And it brings about a good name.
[time=3337] The next quality, chapter 25 verses 9 and 10, speak of the quality of faithfulness.
[time=3344] I'll just read it and move on.
[time=3346] Faithfulness.
[time=3347] Proverbs 25, 9.
[time=3349] If you argue your case with a neighbor, do not betray another man's confidence.
[time=3354] Are he who hears it may shame you and you will never lose your bad reputation?
[time=3359] Are you faithful?
[time=3360] When you give your word that you'll speak, are you give your word that you will not speak?
[time=3365] Are you faithful?
[time=3367] A sixth quality.
[time=3369] Proverbs 20, verse 3 says, it is to a man's honor to avoid strife.
[time=3375] Two types of people.
[time=3376] One, those who bring about strife.
[time=3379] Two, those that Jesus called blessed because they are the peacemaker.
[time=3383] They bring a good name.
[time=3385] And then finally, Proverbs 21, 21 speaks of godliness.
[time=3389] He who pursues righteousness and love finds prosperity.
[time=3394] Two, life and three honor a good name.
[time=3398] It's found in godliness.
[time=3401] Let me ask you this.
[time=3404] If we ask your child today to give daddy a name that describes what he's like, how would they name you?
[time=3412] If we ask your spouse today to say, give us a one name of your spouse that describes your character, what would it be?
[time=3421] You know, there are times in the scriptures where God gave new names.
[time=3426] God called Abraham.
[time=3427] Abraham meant exalted father, but he said, I'm going to make a great nation and I covenant with you to give you a son and son sons and therefore you're no longer Abraham.
[time=3438] You are Abraham, which means father of many.
[time=3441] It was a new name.
[time=3443] Jesus had a disciple.
[time=3445] He was up.
[time=3446] He was down.
[time=3447] He was not solid in his commitment, but there came a day in Simon's life where he came to clarity and he said, you are the Christ, the son of the living God.
[time=3456] And Jesus would say, I will now call you Peter Rock became a new
[time=3464] name because he was a man who was growing solid in his faith.
[time=3468] There was a man by the name of Joseph and he loved people and he loved the beloved and he always encouraged and they changed Joseph's name.
[time=3476] They called him Barnabas, son of encouragement.
[time=3481] What would they name you?
[time=3483] What is your name?
[time=3488] We've been sharing with you the ministry of celebration,
[time=3503] their music I hope has blessed your heart today and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3509] Just before we close, if as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to follow Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=3515] I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3518] Will you pray with me?
[time=3520] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3527] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3531] I ask you to come in today and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3536] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3540] If you prayed this prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of the decision you've made?
