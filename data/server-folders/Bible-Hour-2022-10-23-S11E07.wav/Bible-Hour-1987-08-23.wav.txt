[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hours.
[time=120] Thank you for joining us.
[time=122] Rick's message today is entitled "Managing Our Pride" and is taken from Proverbs chapter 27.
[time=129] One of the ironic conditions of pride is that it often occurs where there is no ground for such feelings.
[time=136] Pride is simply a part of human nature, a dangerous part.
[time=140] In today's study, we will discover that pride is deceptive and destructive.
[time=145] Most of all, God says that it is detestable to Him.
[time=149] In fact, pride is spiritual enemy number one.
[time=153] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=157] Rick's text today is Proverbs chapter 27 verse 21.
[time=161] Our special music today is by guest soloist Brenda Whitfield.
[time=168] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=176] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=182] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=187] It is our joy and privilege to welcome you today to our Second Worship Service.
[time=192] What an opportunity to meet here in this place and to you together.
[time=197] Take our voices and say, "God, you are worthy to be praised." Your name is excellent.
[time=202] It's a name that's above every name.
[time=204] And we want to give you an hour to say nothing more than your word and your name is worthy
[time=210] of our absolute attention.
[time=212] Thank you for coming today and sharing this hour together with us.
[time=215] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=220] And we trust that together we today can lift up the name of Jesus.
[time=225] We have as a guest to minister to us in music today Brenda Whitfield.
[time=229] He comes with an enthusiasm for life and an articulation of song, but most of all commitment
[time=235] to lifting up the name of Jesus because his name is excellent.
[time=239] How excellent is thy name, O Lord?
[time=241] How excellent is thy name.
[time=246] How excellent is thy name, O Lord?
[time=255] How excellent is thy name.
[time=258] How excellent is thy name, O Lord?
[time=266] How excellent is thy name, How excellent is thy name, How excellent is thy name.
[time=274] Look into the midnight blue and see the works you've done.
[time=279] Your children raise a perfect phrase while enemies hold their tongues.
[time=284] Creation shows your splinter, your reigning majesty.
[time=289] And yet I find you take the time to care for one like me.
[time=294] How excellent is thy name, O Lord?
[time=296] How excellent is thy name.
[time=304] How excellent is thy name, O Lord?
[time=307] How excellent is thy name.
[time=315] One fine day when the trumpets play and the dead in Christ will arise.
[time=319] The chosen of you will gather to proclaim your Lord most high.
[time=324] Shout some holy looters, the heavenly hosts will sing.
[time=329] Every knee will fall, every tongue will shout.
[time=332] You're the king of king.
[time=334] How excellent is thy name, O Lord?
[time=337] How excellent is thy name.
[time=340] How excellent is thy name, O Lord?
[time=347] How excellent is thy name.
[time=363] [APPLAUSE]
[time=377] Thank you, Brenda.
[time=378] We appreciate your enthusiasm for life.
[time=381] But there's no compromise of quality of song.
[time=384] The excellent singing for an excellent God.
[time=387] What a privilege it is to know him and to worship him here today.
[time=391] Thank you, Brenda, for being a part of our service.
[time=393] Her husband is a pastor.
[time=394] He's here on the front row.
[time=396] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=398] Loning us your wife or ministry here at Black Hawk.
[time=401] What an opportunity to lift up the name of Jesus.
[time=404] But not everyone knows the name of Jesus.
[time=407] That becomes my responsibility, your responsibility, to make him known here in this community and around the world.
[time=414] God's given us ambassadors for Christ who had come out of this church and go around the world to make that excellent name known.
[time=421] A couple who fit that description are Brad and D. Ball missionaries from our church to American servicemen and Panama.
[time=428] Brad and D, welcome home and come.
[time=430] Let me just ask you a few questions so that our people can know of your ministry.
[time=434] Brad and D are from our church and it's a privilege to have them as ambassadors for Christ and Panama.
[time=441] Brad, tell us a little bit why you're working with American military personnel.
[time=446] How did that come about?
[time=448] It came about several years ago when I accepted the Lord through a ministry in the Philippines called the Overseas Christian Servicemen Center.
[time=458] Our ministry down in Panama is called the Christian Servicemen's Home.
[time=463] It's a home-style ministry, and I remember that home over in the Philippines, but also now down in Panama, we minister to servicemen, open our home.
[time=476] Our home is now larger.
[time=479] It's three stories high, about 80 foot long and about 35 feet or 40 feet wide, so it's a large place.
[time=487] We have Bible studies.
[time=489] We have sync operations, several of the things that you have right here, but more so, an actual home away from home where we have a bunk room for gals, a bunk room for guys, and we can minister one-on-one and present the gospel.
[time=507] We have an evangelistic outreach as well as discipling outreach, but that home away from home where you minister to them as, and by the way, they call us mom and dad.
[time=522] The other couple that's there a little younger, they call them brother and sister.
[time=525] (laughter) One other thing I might mention, the outreach,
[time=536] particularly to military, the reason for it would be because military people are in a time of crisis, and particularly down in Panama, right now at this particular time, there's a problem.
[time=551] There's unrest in Panama.
[time=553] The military people that are married, many of them live right out in Panama, so there is a danger.
[time=560] And they could be in a dangerous situation as far as their job is concerned also because they could be called in to, to quell a riot or whatever.
[time=573] So there's a concern on the military people's part right there and another reason for ministering to them.
[time=579] D, are there opportunities for ministry for you amongst the women?
[time=584] Yes, there is.
[time=585] It's not exactly like I thought it might be because God has a unique way of bringing people into our lives and giving a special task to do.
[time=593] Instead of having a weekly Bible study with women, our women is in the minority in our ministry.
[time=599] Probably maybe 30% of the 10,000 military young people stationed in Panama are women.
[time=606] And God has been good to send women to the ministry for us.
[time=611] Once a month, we have a lady's state set aside special for ladies, both military and military wives.
[time=618] And sometimes the older people have children just out of high school that join us when they're home to fellowship in the Christian environment.
[time=627] We have Bible study, we start our morning out with breakfast.
[time=631] Then we follow with a Bible study and then a time of craft day.
[time=635] We find us women find that we need that one to one with women relating and God has been very good to open different avenues that we can reach out and be a strength to them as we encourage one another in the body of Christ.
[time=649] We find that we build up the body of Christ and we just thank God for the opportunity.
[time=654] He gives us to encourage one another along the way.
[time=657] And as we encourage each other to keep our eyes centered on Jesus, the problems that surround us aren't half as bad when we have that inward strength.
[time=666] Thank you, Deep.
[time=667] Brad, you started to mention the political unrest.
[time=670] How has that affected your ministry there in Panama?
[time=674] Political unrest is in Panama City mostly.
[time=680] And it's not in our local area.
[time=682] We're kind of separated by a few miles, say two or three miles from that.
[time=686] But it affects it because of the fact that we have many activities such as just sightseeing downtown or going out to some mission station.
[time=696] And to do that, we have to leave our area and go out into the area that would be affected.
[time=702] And as I mentioned, the military guys could be called on to become involved in that.
[time=707] We've had to cancel some of our things, trips and so forth.
[time=711] But not a large number of trips.
[time=716] The political situation still needs your prayers.
[time=720] The political situation is still up in the air.
[time=724] There's a lot of demonstrations going on.
[time=726] There's a lot of demonstrations against the -- of the people against Panamanian government.
[time=730] And then sometimes there are actually demonstrations against the canal area, the U.S.
[time=737] So we would appreciate you praying for us and a praying.
[time=741] That the ministry would continue in spite of the problems.
[time=746] Let's do that right now.
[time=748] God, we would pray for Brad and Dee, that you would have a hand of not only protection on them, but a hand of blessing that you might give them opportunity to proclaim the name of Christ.
[time=760] That Panamanians and Americans who are there would hear of Christ and come to put their faith and trust in Him as a result of their ministry.
[time=769] We ask that in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=772] Thank you, Brad and Dee.
[time=774] Brenda is going to come back and sing for us again and buy her song.
[time=778] She is going to direct our attention to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=799] If the shift of your life is tossing one, the sea of strife,
[time=810] then you need someone.
[time=814] If you feel you're so long and your house is not a home,
[time=824] you need someone.
[time=829] And if it seemed life isn't fair and there's no one left to
[time=838] share all those lonely days and nights when things just won't
[time=845] turn out right and you want someone to care, someone to just
[time=854] be there.
[time=856] You need someone.
[time=860] I give you Jesus.
[time=866] He's the peace that passes all understanding.
[time=874] I give you Jesus.
[time=881] He's the perfect love that cast in our own fears.
[time=888] I give you Jesus.
[time=894] He's the water that you drink and never thirst again.
[time=902] I give you Jesus, all of my friends.
[time=911] I give you Jesus.
[time=919] And if the pressure's all around, keep your spirit to the
[time=927] ground, then you need someone.
[time=932] Yes.
[time=935] And if this old body's all in pain and your health, you can't regain.
[time=944] You need someone.
[time=948] And if it seems that you have tried with all the strength you
[time=955] had in sight and it seems that you have failed.
[time=961] Remember on the cross, he nailed all the bitterness and grief to
[time=968] give you peace and sweet relief.
[time=972] He is that someone that we all need.
[time=977] His name is Jesus.
[time=982] He's the peace that passes all understanding.
[time=990] I give you Jesus.
[time=996] He's the perfect love that cast in our own fears.
[time=1003] I give you Jesus.
[time=1010] You want turn that you drink and never thirst again.
[time=1017] I give you Jesus.
[time=1023] All of my friends.
[time=1026] I give you Jesus.
[time=1029] He's everything, everything that we need.
[time=1033] His name is Jesus.
[time=1037] My courage.
[time=1040] I give you Jesus.
[time=1046] Jesus.
[time=1051] Again, I would like to thank you for joining us today for the
[time=1060] Bible Hour.
[time=1061] We have certainly enjoyed Brenda Whitfield's ministry already this hour and are looking forward to hearing from her again.
[time=1068] During the month of August, we've invited special guests in.
[time=1071] And next Sunday, we have another guest that we're looking forward to.
[time=1075] Yes, I've enjoyed Brenda Whitfield today, too, and look forward to her continued ministry in our service.
[time=1080] And then next Sunday, we have Blake Leopold.
[time=1082] Rick Blake has been here before with our own Keith and Star Broadigan singing together and you'll enjoy his baritone voice.
[time=1089] He has a tremendous message, a beautiful voice and a real heart for God.
[time=1093] He'll be with us in our service next Sunday morning.
[time=1096] And we want to explain to you friends who are watching by way of television that we are one week delayed in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1104] And so you are able to, after watching the Bible Hour come and to join us live here for our morning worship services, either at 9.30 or at 10.50.
[time=1114] And it will be next Sunday, the 30th of August that Blake will be here with us.
[time=1118] We want to encourage you to join us by way of television, or if you can, to come in person.
[time=1124] Right now, we are in the first steps of building our brand new sanctuary, a new home for Black Hawk Baptist Church, and a new home for the Bible Hour.
[time=1133] And the construction has been exciting to watch.
[time=1136] And we'd like to share some of that with you right now so that you can join with us in watching our new building as it's being built.
[time=1144] Presently, we are pouring the foundations and laying the first layer of block.
[time=1148] We're not putting the walls up this week, but a few blocks are going into place just so we can see where the plumbing and the electrical service all need to stub in their wiring.
[time=1157] And it's exciting to see that perimeter being formed.
[time=1161] That gives us a good idea of how big the building is actually going to be.
[time=1165] There will be over 50,000 square feet of building going in place.
[time=1169] The whole building of that size, the foundations are very, very deep.
[time=1173] You can see some of the men down in a hole that's well over their head.
[time=1177] That will all be poured in with concrete to hold the tons of steel framing that go up from there into the air.
[time=1185] Many of the men have been working here for almost a month now.
[time=1189] It'll be September the 7th when the steel arrives and we'll get building structure going up instead of just down into the ground as you see here.
[time=1199] But as Jesus taught us, a firm foundation is essential for life and for buildings.
[time=1204] And so the foundations are going in.
[time=1206] They're looking forward to the steel going up.
[time=1208] And then that really becomes a visualization of the new sanctuary that God is giving us here at Blackhawk.
[time=1215] So as you think about us, we want to ask you to pray for us that God would meet every need and at the same time he would keep our vision and our perspective first on Christ in exulting him and secondly on people.
[time=1229] Thanks for joining us today.
[time=1231] Before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to share one final offer with you.
[time=1237] For a booklet called A Closer Walk.
[time=1240] Many of you are familiar with timeless insights, an old friend, now has a new name, A Closer Walk.
[time=1246] This is a daily Bible study guide that will take you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=1251] We'd like to encourage you to be studying God's Word daily and to use a closer walk as a study guide to help you in that process.
[time=1259] If you'll write to us, we'll send you a copy right away.
[time=1263] They're here.
[time=1264] They're in stock.
[time=1265] The only thing we need is your request.
[time=1267] You can receive this pamphlet, A Closer Walk, by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1274] And the zip code is 46815.
[time=1278] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1286] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1288] And thank you for joining us today.
[time=1290] And we do hope you'll write to receive a closer walk.
[time=1293] Now as we go back to our worship service, we'll hear again from our delightful guest, Brenda Whitfield.

[time=1565] (audience applauding)
[time=1572] We are so thankful to Brenda and her husband and her accompanist and partner.
[time=1579] I'll breathe that they would give a morning of their life to serving the master and serving him here at Black Hawk with us.
[time=1586] We are thankful.
[time=1588] It was Paul who said, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[time=1594] "for it is the power of God and the salvation to everyone that believes "to the Jew first, then also to the Greeks." Are you ashamed?
[time=1604] Oh, it's easy today to sit in this place and say, "How excellent is thy name, O Lord." How about in the marketplace tomorrow?
[time=1613] Just as bold.
[time=1614] God make us bold for Jesus' sake.
[time=1617] God help us to remember that there is power in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1623] Thank you that in the last morning's service, that power was manifest as one was set free from the bondage of sin.
[time=1632] There were those who were challenged of heart by song to with boldness proclaim Christ.
[time=1638] God, as we meet this hour, we want you to meet with us, to take charge, to capture our imagination and to hold hostage our minds that we would singularly and solely focus on you
[time=1653] and give to us a sense that we have met with the God of the universe.
[time=1661] We humble ourselves before you, and we worship you today.
[time=1666] God, today, we come to give you the gift of our worship.
[time=1671] We know it is so inadequate that we have to stop and say, "Thank you that you would even allow us to praise your name." And we find joy in doing that.
[time=1684] God, there are others today whose hearts are heavy; the joy is all but gone.
[time=1691] We need to know of your healing hand.
[time=1694] We ask you today to heal the hearts of those who are today mourning the loss of loved ones.
[time=1701] For Debbie Parrish, in the loss of her stepfather, Mike and Faye, in the loss of their little baby.
[time=1708] We pray today for Ken and Helen Augsberger, because their little grandson is balanced precariously between life and death at this very moment.
[time=1719] Well, God, we would ask that you would heal him and restore him.
[time=1723] God, we would pray today for those who have broken relationships that pride would not allow to be healed, that you would break that power of sin in pride and give us the ability to restore broken relationships.
[time=1740] Most of all, God, today we pray that you would speak to us, that you would speak louder than the voice of our own pride that calls us to live for ourself.
[time=1752] We ask you to speak in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1758] If you do have a Bible with you this morning, we're studying through the Book of Proverbs.
[time=1764] It gives to us a variety of themes.
[time=1767] And so I've picked out Proverbs 27, verse 21 to represent our theme for today.
[time=1774] So I invite you, if you have a Bible to turn to Proverbs 27 and verse 21, I'd like to read that verse for you right now.
[time=1783] Proverbs 27, verse 21.
[time=1786] The crucible for silver.
[time=1789] The furnace for gold, but a man is tested by the praise he receives.
[time=1799] The crucible that grinding pot is where silver is tried.
[time=1805] Gold is placed into a furnace and its substance is made known.
[time=1811] But the test of our life is how do we handle praise?
[time=1817] How do we handle praise?
[time=1820] In the Book of Proverbs, one of the reoccurring themes is the tension between pride and humility.
[time=1828] This morning, I would like to give you three of the devastating consequences of pride.
[time=1834] How to handle when you're praised?
[time=1838] A lady came to her pastor after a stirring message on pride and said, "Pastor, I've got to confess to you that I struggle greatly with pride." As a matter of fact, I find myself trapped in the mirror for hours a day just admiring myself, "I'm so full of pride." The pastor looked at her and said, "Madam, you don't have a problem with pride.
[time=1861] You've got a problem with imagination." One of the first devastating consequences of pride is this.
[time=1870] It's deceitful.
[time=1872] Pride is a great deceiver.
[time=1875] In the Book of Proverbs, Solomon mourns his son and us as well of the deceitfulness of pride.
[time=1883] It is very deceitful.
[time=1884] Pride gives to us a false sense of confidence.
[time=1889] It is pride that says, "I can handle it.
[time=1892] I'm in control here.
[time=1894] Look out for me." Let me give you a verse to support that.
[time=1899] Chapter 18, verses 11 and 12, speak of the deceitfulness of pride,
[time=1905] how deceptive it is.
[time=1907] It gives us, first of all, a false sense of confidence.
[time=1910] Chapter 18, verse 11.
[time=1913] The wealth of the rich man is their fortified city.
[time=1918] They imagine it, an unscalable wall.
[time=1924] Before his downfall, a man's heart is proud,
[time=1931] but humility comes before honor.
[time=1935] She was labeled the unsinkable.
[time=1939] Her formal name, the RMS Titanic.
[time=1943] Newspapers had boasted the media had heralded the greatest ship of float.
[time=1950] The technology that went into the Titanic earned her the title on her main invoige, the unsinkable.
[time=1959] But you know history.
[time=1962] In 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg.
[time=1967] Her hull was ripped in a gassed open, water flowed in.
[time=1972] She lost her balance.
[time=1974] The alarm was given.
[time=1976] She is going down, go to the lifeboats.
[time=1980] But everybody remembered.
[time=1983] She's the unsinkable.
[time=1985] She's the Titanic, and hundreds refused to get on the lifeboats
[time=1992] because the Titanic couldn't be sunk.
[time=1996] 1,502 people died on the unsinkable, as she went on under.
[time=2005] Pride gives us this deceptive view of life.
[time=2011] A false sense of confidence.
[time=2016] Here, Proverbs, speaks of the rich man, and it's not meant to be attacked on riches.
[time=2021] I am a rich man.
[time=2024] Most of you are rich.
[time=2026] We live in this country and in this community, and we are amongst the world's wealthiest.
[time=2032] And there comes the inherent danger with that increase of wealth that suddenly say, this is mine.
[time=2040] I have it.
[time=2041] And not only is it mine, it gives me security.
[time=2044] There are no problems in life that I cannot handle.
[time=2047] I am secure.
[time=2049] With pride comes that false sense of security.
[time=2054] Sometimes we get that sense of security because of our job, and we have a good job, and we do well at our job, and our boss has assured us that the job will always be there.
[time=2066] That's what people told me in 1977.
[time=2069] You're looking for a job for your wife.
[time=2071] International Harvester is a secure company.
[time=2074] Get her in at the harvester.
[time=2077] That was good advice from 1977, but nothing is secure forever.
[time=2084] Others of us look at our life and we see our vulnerability, and we say, I am secure because I provide through my job, and if I'm gone, I have life insurance, and it will be secure.
[time=2096] Life insurance companies are not always secure.
[time=2102] Men, you may not be secure.
[time=2104] Some of you have made the exact mistake I have made, and that is you are worth five to ten times dead what you are alive.
[time=2114] That is not a secure position.
[time=2119] Lady Astor had dickered often with Churchill, and she looked at him with disgust and said, "If I were your wife, I'd put arsenic in your tea." Churchill said, "Madam, if I were your husband, I'd drink it."
[time=2137] Men, I don't know what you placed your security in today, but check out the tea.
[time=2144] You see, we possess much.
[time=2146] We've earned much, and we have pride in what we've done.
[time=2151] We said, I'm secure.
[time=2154] That's pride.
[time=2155] It gives us a false sense of security.
[time=2159] It's a deceiver.
[time=2161] It is so deceptive.
[time=2162] It only does it give us a false sense of security.
[time=2167] It gives us a false sense of wisdom.
[time=2172] Proverbs, chapter 26, verse 12.
[time=2178] It states this simple principle.
[time=2180] Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?
[time=2184] It may be up for debate amongst the rest of us, but he thinks he's wise.
[time=2191] There is more hope for a fool than for him.
[time=2195] You see, it's the person who thinks they're wise that loses their ability to be taught, to be instructed, to be directed, and they are most vulnerable because they think they know.
[time=2206] A fool who says, "I don't know." He's in a better position than the man who falsely says, "I do know." Pride is a deceiver, and it deceives us into thinking that we know more than we do, and it gives us a false sense of wisdom.
[time=2227] Ed Lai Stevenson was running for a president.
[time=2230] The press had given him a hard time, and not over issues for which he should have been attacked.
[time=2237] Stevenson grabbed the newspaper off the stand and jumped into a cab and read the reviews of his speech, and they said that Stevenson gave a magnificent speech, but nobody understood it.
[time=2250] He speaks above the head of the common man.
[time=2254] Stevenson folded up the paper and put it under his arm, and he said to the cab he's driving.
[time=2259] This paper says, "I speak above the intelligence of the average man." What do you say?
[time=2265] The cab he said, "Well, I can follow everything you say." I don't know about the average guy.
[time=2272] I'm above average.
[time=2273] I don't know about those other people, but I've got it here.
[time=2277] Something about pride that doesn't allow us to admit, we might be the average guy.
[time=2285] And this false sense of wisdom often manifests itself in some unusual ways.
[time=2293] Defensiveness, when somebody suggests we're wrong.
[time=2296] When you're defensive, or when I'm defensive, what we're saying is, "Hey, you're stepping on my pride, buddy, by insinuating I am wrong." Defensiveness is a subtle form of pride.
[time=2310] Argumentiveness is the same.
[time=2312] It says, "No, you're wrong because I'm right, and if I didn't think I was right, I'd change my mind, and then I know I'd be right." Coralsome spirit.
[time=2325] Pride is a deceiver.
[time=2327] It makes us think we know more than we do.
[time=2330] Pride is a deceiver thirdly because it gives us a false sense of worth.
[time=2335] Chapter 25, verses 6 and 7 say, "Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence.
[time=2345] Do not claim a place of honor among great men.
[time=2349] It is better for him to say to you, come up here than for him to humiliate you before noble men."
[time=2360] Pride can give us a false sense of worth that we think that we are somebody significant, important.
[time=2369] Solomon teaches his son this by the illustration of the ancient banqueting table.
[time=2374] A king would call a banquet, nobility would be invited, and a long table would be set with chairs on each side of the table, and then at the very head of the table, one chair would be positioned perpendicular.
[time=2388] This was the king's chair.
[time=2391] And each chair closest to the king represented the significance in the worth of the individual.
[time=2398] And so a high nobleman would sit here next to the king.
[time=2401] Another nobleman would be here.
[time=2403] And then somebody less significant here down to the least of the guest
[time=2409] would be seated here.
[time=2412] But occasionally you would come to the table and there would be no one who would call out who is to sit in which chair.
[time=2419] And so an individual would simply size up the audience and he would pick a chair for himself.
[time=2426] Now Solomon says to his son in this word of wisdom, "Do not position yourself right up here by the king, unless you want to be humiliated." And him to say, "Fred, what are you doing?
[time=2442] Get down there.
[time=2445] Don't position yourself down here so that if the king wants you, he can exalt you and say, "Come, sit by me."
[time=2455] But you see, it's pride that gives us this elevated sense of worth.
[time=2460] And we say, "Oh, I belong up there.
[time=2462] I'm special.
[time=2463] I'm above these others who are here." One man called for such a banquet.
[time=2470] The table was all set.
[time=2472] The chairs were all in place.
[time=2474] The head chair was positioned perfectly at the table for him, the host, to be seated in.
[time=2480] But the host did not enter the room.
[time=2483] Each person was allowed to pick their seat where they felt.
[time=2487] They deserved the sit.
[time=2488] And those whose pride was high positioned themselves right here.
[time=2493] Once each person had taken their place, the host entered the room.
[time=2497] And he went to his chair and he picked it up.
[time=2501] He moved it to the other end so that he could sit down by those who were humble.
[time=2509] Pride says, "I belong up there." It elevates our sense of self-worth.
[time=2518] The Civil War had wound down to an end.
[time=2521] Lee had surrendered to Grant at Applimatics.
[time=2525] Grant was back in Washington at the President's side when the parade of troops was to come in.
[time=2532] Since Grant was with the President that left William to come see Sherman to lead the United States Army into the Capitol.
[time=2541] Behind Sherman was to be each of the cores of the Army, each led by their respective generals.
[time=2549] Sherman came to one of his generals, O.O. Howard.
[time=2552] And he pointed out to Howard that one of Howard's officers had distinguished himself as a man of merit.
[time=2559] And Sherman said, "General Howard, would you be willing to concede your place to this officer and allow him to ride at the head of your core?"
[time=2570] Both out of duty but out of sincerity, Howard said, "It would be an honor to give my position to him.
[time=2579] It would be an honor to give my position to him." Sherman said, "Good, General Howard.
[time=2587] That means you're free and available to ride next to me at the head of the Army."
[time=2594] Humility comes before honor.
[time=2598] But pride gives us a false sense of worth that says, "I belong up here."
[time=2606] Finally, of the deceptiveness of pride this morning, pride gives us a false sense of spiritual adequacy.
[time=2618] Proverbs 30, verse 12.
[time=2626] There are those who are pure in their own eyes, and yet they are not cleansed of their filth.
[time=2635] Those whose eyes are ever so hottie whose glances are disdainful.
[time=2641] A 13th verse gives us a good description of the proud individual.
[time=2645] Their eyes hottie, superior, looking above everybody else.
[time=2649] Their glance is disdainful, down condescendingly.
[time=2655] And they are the ones who think of themselves as pure.
[time=2662] When actually they are filthy.
[time=2665] You see, pride says to us, "I'm okay.
[time=2669] I'm a good man.
[time=2671] I'm moral.
[time=2672] I haven't done all the things that people do who are him moral.
[time=2677] I am pure." God's going to accept me.
[time=2681] God knows who I am.
[time=2682] He knows what a good guy I am.
[time=2685] God says there's none, righteous.
[time=2688] No?
[time=2689] There's not one.
[time=2691] There's none that seeks after truth.
[time=2693] No, they've all together become unprofitable.
[time=2696] They've all gone their own way.
[time=2698] God says the very best of us are in the same lot as the very worst of us
[time=2706] in that we all covered with sin.
[time=2709] Isaiah the prophet said that our lives are like filthy rags.
[time=2712] Some of you guys who work in the garage, you know, you've got an old rag and you take that and you wipe off the fittings after you've greased the axles and those little desserts.
[time=2723] And you take that rag and you get some clean grease and you get that old grease and it's got the grime in it.
[time=2728] Then you take that rag and you come over here and you wipe up an oil spill on the floor and then the oil got some salt and you got that grimy rag.
[time=2736] God said, "There you are.
[time=2738] That's what I see in you.
[time=2740] You say you're clean.
[time=2741] I say you're a filthy rag." You see, God says, "Though you may do some good things, Rick, you are a sinner and your sin marks you as unclean."
[time=2754] But pride says, "I'm clean.
[time=2757] I'm sure we're worn by the Apostle Paul and 2 Corinthians that unwise men compare themselves one to another and then think themselves
[time=2768] to be wise.
[time=2770] You'll always be able to find someone whose life is a little dirtier than yours.
[time=2775] That does not make yours or mine clean."
[time=2781] It gives to us a false sense of spiritual adequacy.
[time=2785] "I'm okay.
[time=2786] I never do those type of things." Two little boys found a dog and each of them wanted the dog and that posed quite a dilemma.
[time=2795] Two boys and one dog.
[time=2798] They made a plan to decide who would get to keep the dog.
[time=2801] They said, "We'll meet right back here tomorrow and whichever one of us can tell the biggest and the best lie gets to keep the dog." So they met the same place and they're in the business of swapping lies and one's trying to top the other and this minister walks up.
[time=2815] He overhears what's going on and he says, "Boys, why are you telling these lies?" They said, "Well, we found this dog and we just made a deal whoever tells the biggest and the best lie gets to keep the dog." Well, the minister was quite disgust and he said, "Well, I think that's terrible and I want you to know I never did anything like that when I was a little boy." The boys looked at each other and say, "Okay, you win the dog."
[time=2841] "I never did anything like that.
[time=2846] I'm clean.
[time=2848] I'm pure.
[time=2850] That's pride." It says somehow I'm spiritually adequate because of who I am.
[time=2857] Problem number one is this.
[time=2861] Pride is deceitful.
[time=2866] Problem number two is this one.
[time=2869] Pride is destructive.
[time=2874] Proverbs 16 verses 18 and 19, read as follows.
[time=2881] Pride goes before destruction and a hotty spirit before a fall.
[time=2886] You want to guarantee destruction and failure and misery in your life?
[time=2890] Let pride lead you.
[time=2892] That's where it ends up.
[time=2894] It's better to be lowly in spirit among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud.
[time=2902] Similarly, chapter 18 verse 12, "Before his downfall a man's heart is proud,
[time=2910] but humility comes before honor." Pride is destructive.
[time=2918] It leads us because of its deceitfulness down the wrong path and at the end of an all destruction.
[time=2925] Failure, misery.
[time=2927] Let me fill in some of the specifics for you.
[time=2930] Pride is destructive because it leads to pretense.
[time=2934] Chapter 12 verse 9 says this, "Better to be a nobody, I qualify,
[time=2940] better to be a nobody and have a servant than to pretend to be a somebody
[time=2948] and have no food." Do you know in our society it says, "Don't worry about what your life's like.
[time=2957] Just have a good appearance.
[time=2959] Just dress sharp.
[time=2961] Just wear the right kind of jewelry.
[time=2963] Just drive the right car.
[time=2965] Just be seen in the right places." At least some people are honest.
[time=2971] I love it when you see a beautiful car with an honest owner.
[time=2976] It's the little bumper sticker that says, "I owe, I owe.
[time=2980] It's off to work I go." And you know what this verse is giving us here?
[time=2986] You know that there are people today in this assembly of people who are living out of pride and pretense.
[time=2993] And they're simply borrowing on top of borrowing on top of borrowing so that out of pride they can say, "Look at me.
[time=3000] Look what I've got." And then they're sitting back and they're literally saying, "How are we going to buy groceries this week?
[time=3008] How are we going to feed our children this week?" We know how we're going to pay for the groceries.
[time=3014] But boy, do we know how to drive them home.
[time=3018] Proverbs 12, 9.
[time=3021] Better to be a nobody.
[time=3023] Maybe you have a helper.
[time=3025] Then to pretend to be somebody and have no food.
[time=3029] You see, pride will drive you and it will push you to make visible signs of success that are unreal and insincere
[time=3039] and you will be destroyed.
[time=3043] Pride is destructive because it produces pretense.
[time=3046] It's destructive.
[time=3049] Chuck Swindall tells the story of his sons and his sons buddies, they made a clubhouse.
[time=3054] You remember having a clubhouse?
[time=3055] We never had clubhouses.
[time=3056] We had treehouses.
[time=3057] We built treehouses up there and that was a spot.
[time=3060] We had all kinds of rules.
[time=3062] Our rules were two.
[time=3064] No girls allowed and no girls allowed.
[time=3066] Those were our two rules.
[time=3067] But Swindall tells the story that his sons treehouse club came up with three rules.
[time=3074] One, nobody act big.
[time=3077] Two, nobody act small.
[time=3081] Three, everybody act medium.
[time=3085] Isn't that good advice?
[time=3087] Don't act big.
[time=3089] Don't be pretentious.
[time=3090] But you know what?
[time=3091] We can be pretentious about being small.
[time=3094] We can fake our humility.
[time=3097] And we can act so humble.
[time=3099] And it's just the right way.
[time=3101] We'll paint people so they'll ask the question so that it happens to come out.
[time=3106] It just happens to slip.
[time=3111] Nobody act big.
[time=3113] Nobody act small.
[time=3115] Everybody act medium.
[time=3118] Pride is destructive not only because it produces pretense but because it produces strife.
[time=3124] Chapter 13 verse 10.
[time=3128] Pride only breeds quarrels but wisdom is found in those who take advice.
[time=3141] A teachable spirit, how hard it is to find, what a rare commodity, than someone who has
[time=3150] ears to hear, who follows James advice.
[time=3155] Let everyone be slow to speak, slow to wrath, but quick to hear.
[time=3160] But it's pride that says let me give you my opinion.
[time=3162] I think you're wrong.
[time=3165] Pride stirs up quarrels.
[time=3167] It forces us to be oriented only to ourself.
[time=3171] Earlier today by way of the bullish and we ask you to meditate on Philippians chapter 2 verses 3 and 4.
[time=3179] It says let nothing be done through vain conceit, art, selfish pride, but let every man look upon another man's work as more important than his own.
[time=3193] But pride says hey notice me, look at this.
[time=3199] It's quarrelsome.
[time=3201] It demands the attention.
[time=3202] Pride is destructive because it produces strife.
[time=3205] Thirdly pride is destructive because it produces mocking.
[time=3209] Chapter 21 verses 23 and 24.
[time=3213] The word marker has a very specific sense in the book of Proverbs.
[time=3217] A marker is a person who has so digressed to where they not only think they are right, they mock those who disagree.
[time=3226] They ridicule, they make sport of.
[time=3229] Chapter 21 verse 23.
[time=3231] He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity.
[time=3238] The proud and arrogant man, marker is his name.
[time=3243] He behaves with overweening pride.
[time=3246] Calamity awaits for those who are led by an arrogant spirit in a proud heart because they will turn out to be markers.
[time=3258] Finally, thirdly pride is not only deceptive and destructive.
[time=3266] It is detestable to God.
[time=3270] There are seven or eight passages that teach us this but allow me to draw your attention to just one.
[time=3276] Proverbs chapter 6 and verse 16 through 19.
[time=3283] It says there are six things that God hates.
[time=3287] Count them, six.
[time=3289] No, wait a minute.
[time=3290] Seven things are detestable to the Lord.
[time=3294] Seven of them.
[time=3295] One, hotty eyes.
[time=3297] Two, a lying tongue.
[time=3299] Three, hands that shed innocent blood.
[time=3302] Four, a heart that devises wicked scheme.
[time=3305] Five, feet that are quick to rush into evil.
[time=3308] Six, a false witness who pours out lies.
[time=3311] Seven, a man who stirs up dissension amongst his brothers.
[time=3316] But of the six, no, seven things God detests.
[time=3320] Spiritual enemy number one is pride.
[time=3326] Hotty eyes.
[time=3329] A proud look.
[time=3331] Why does God put that above everything else?
[time=3333] Because it is our pride that says, I'm spiritual and adequate.
[time=3338] I don't need God.
[time=3340] It is our pride that makes us deny Him in the marketplace.
[time=3343] Though we'll come here today and name the name of Jesus tomorrow, we'll be embarrassed.
[time=3348] It's pride that keeps many of you from coming forward in invitation and saying, yes, I need Christ.
[time=3355] And God says it is deceitful, it is destructive, it is detestable.
[time=3363] In 1847, a man by the name of Sir James Simpson made a medical discovery that chloroform would put people to sleep,
[time=3375] anesthetize them that surgery could be done without pain.
[time=3381] That was the revolution of the medical world for that part of the 1800s.
[time=3387] He had made numerous discoveries, that was obvious, the greatest.
[time=3391] Sir James Simpson was teaching a class to medical students.
[time=3394] His accomplishments were well known and one of the students says, Professor Simpson, what is the greatest discovery of your life?
[time=3403] Certainly he would speak of chloroform.
[time=3405] And Sir James Simpson said, without hesitation, the greatest discovery of my life was the day I discovered that I'm a sinner,
[time=3413] and that Jesus Christ died for me.
[time=3416] That is the greatest discovery of life.
[time=3420] Have you made that greatest discovery of life?
[time=3424] Have you opened up your heart to Christ?
[time=3427] Have you received him as Savior?
[time=3430] James tells us this word, God resists the proud, but he gives more grace to the humble.
[time=3440] Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, and he will lift you up.
[time=3449] But humility comes before honor.
[time=3454] Would you today, on this Sunday morning, humble yourself before God and this congregation and say, I need to make life's greatest discovery.
[time=3465] I need to receive Jesus Christ as my Savior.
[time=3469] I will not be ashamed with all boldness today.
[time=3473] I will receive him.
[time=3475] Would you make that decision? I pray that you will.
[time=3479] We are grateful today for the inspirational music that was presented by our special musical guest Brenda Whitfield,
[time=3503] and then the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.

[time=3513] I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3517] Will you pray with me?
[time=3519] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins,
[time=3526] and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3532] I ask you to come in, dear Lord, today.
[time=3535] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
