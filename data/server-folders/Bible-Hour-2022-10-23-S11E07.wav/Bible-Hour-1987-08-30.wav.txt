[time=104] And people who are driven by their reason also perish because they have ignored their appetites.
[time=111] Only a few wise and lucky ones are able to sustain the creative balance between these two opposites.

[time=132] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=136] We're glad you joined us.
[time=138] Rick's message today is taken from Proverbs chapter 23 and is entitled Managing Our Appetites.
[time=145] Many of us, perhaps most of us, are occasionally given to extremes.
[time=149] It may be the extreme of the Stoics who deny themselves even the most reasonable pleasures, or it may be the extremes of the Epicureans who live for pleasure.
[time=158] Balance is the critical factor, and Solomon pleads with us to keep both our appetites and reason in control.
[time=164] In fact, today's study not only contains a warning, but also a way out of the pleasure tray.
[time=170] So we invite you to open your Bible to Proverbs as we study Managing Our Appetites.
[time=176] Today we will be studying Proverbs chapter 23 verses 10 through 35.
[time=181] Special music today will be provided by guest soloist Blake Leopold.
[time=187] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=195] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=199] Now, here's Rick.
[time=204] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=209] It's a joy to welcome you this morning and to hear your voices as you greet one another.
[time=214] We're delighted that you've come that together as a body of people we can worship the Lord.
[time=219] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=223] We trust that in this hour as we sing together, that there will be a confidence in our life, that our feet are planted solidly on a rock in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=233] Peter's going to come and lead us as we sing Him number 423 on Christ the Solid Rock I Stand.
[time=247] We'll sing verses one, three, and four. Sing it together.
[time=277] [MUSIC - 67 seconds]
[time=351] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=353] As you know, we've had wonderful special music for our month of August with guests coming in each Sunday.
[time=360] We've given the choir a break as well as our soloists.
[time=364] They'll be beginning again this week, however, and if you're interested in joining our sanctuary choir,
[time=370] you can go out to the booth in the foyer and pre-register.
[time=374] We'd be glad to have you join and use your talents for Christ in that way.
[time=378] This Sunday as far as special music is concerned is no exception to the good music we've had throughout this month.
[time=385] We welcome back again to Fort Wayne Blake Leopold.
[time=388] Blake was here several years ago and lived in Fort Wayne, now lives in Virginia.
[time=393] Ministers for the Lord is the brother-in-law of Keith Brodigum, sings marvelously and loves the Lord and loves to sing for him.
[time=401] So I'd like to have you welcome him now.
[time=403] Blake Leopold will be with us this morning and then he'll give a mini concert this evening.
[time=407] Let's listen as he ministers to us.
[time=434] [MUSIC - 137 seconds]
[time=581] Today we've been enjoying the ministry of Blank Leopold
[time=588] and certainly are thankful that he's invested a Sunday with us here at Blackhawk.
[time=593] We're just as thankful that you've joined us and want to thank you for giving us an hour of your time that we can share God's word with you today through music and a study of the scriptures.
[time=603] Good morning, Pete.
[time=604] I'm looking forward to the beginning of the fall and some of the special events coming up.
[time=608] - Well, I am too, Rick.
[time=610] We have had a good August with our regular musicians having a rest, and we've had some special guests and that have done a super job, but we'll be starting off in full gear now this week and anxious to see our musicians ministering again on the Bible hour and to our own people here in the sanctuary.
[time=626] I'm looking forward to that too.
[time=628] And as the fall comes, there are a number of special ministries that we're planning for this new season.
[time=633] One of the things that we're very excited about is called a Walk Through the Bible Seminar.
[time=639] It is a New Testament Seminar.
[time=641] You may recall six months ago, we hosted a Walk Through the Bible Old Testament Seminar.
[time=647] That particular program was a great program and exceeded our expectations in every way.
[time=653] We had more people come than we ever expected and the benefit that each of us received through the seminar was far greater than we ever anticipated.
[time=662] And as we came out of that Old Testament Seminar, we said that very day, today we need to plan the New Testament Seminar.
[time=670] So we did that, and it's coming up on Friday and Saturday, September 25th and 26th.
[time=676] And we want to invite you to come.
[time=679] In this Friday night, Saturday morning seminar, you'll be given a whole overview of the entire New Testament, beginning with the life of Christ, tracing His ministry and His teaching, then through the book of Acts following Peter and John and then Paul, and we'll put the whole New Testament into chronological, meaningful, and insightful order.
[time=700] Over 92% of the people who attend this seminar later on can repeat the entire concept of tracing the New Testament from memory.
[time=710] It's that exciting of a teaching tool, and we want to include you and invite you to come.
[time=716] If you would like to attend the seminar, you can simply write to us here at the Bible Hour and ask for a registration form, and we'll mail one to you.
[time=725] In just a few moments, we'll give you the address for the Bible Hour so you can be a part of the walk through the New Testament Seminar.
[time=732] Then on Saturday of that weekend, we have a special musical guest coming.
[time=736] Rick, it's going to be a great weekend.
[time=738] I can't think of a more interesting seminar than the walk through the New Testament.
[time=742] It's great.
[time=743] And then while you're jotting down dates, you might consider September 27th.
[time=747] On that date, we're going to have Jim Murray.
[time=749] He's a tenor.
[time=750] If you're familiar with the Imperial's Quartet, you'll remember Jim was the tenor for many years in that group, and he is now going out in a ministry on his own, and he'll be here with us the entire day on September 27th in the morning, and then he'll give a full concert that evening at 6 p.m.
[time=766] That's at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and just put that down on your calendar and come and join us for this great weekend we're going to have.
[time=774] Thank you.
[time=775] Also, we want to encourage you to write today for a Bible study tool called A Closer Walk.
[time=781] A Closer Walk is printed and published by our friends from Walk Through the Bible Ministries who are bringing us the New Testament Seminar.
[time=789] A Closer Walk is a daily Bible study guide that allows you to systematically, and with organization, read through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=799] Many of the people I talk to daily about their spiritual lives are frustrated because they're not consistent in studying God's Word, and when they do open it, they're never sure what to read and how to apply what they've read to their life.
[time=812] This simple tool will help you solve all of those problems.
[time=816] First of all, it is a daily guide so it instructs you what to read.
[time=820] Secondly, it gives you insight in understanding what you've just read, and then finally, it teaches you how to apply it to your life.
[time=828] We've been offering it to you this month and this will be the last Sunday we'll offer A Closer Walk, so we want to encourage you to write today for A Closer Walk, and then also to write for a registration for the seminar on the New Testament.
[time=843] You can receive the booklet or the information on the seminar by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=856] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code is 46815.
[time=865] Thank you for joining us today as we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=869] Blake will be singing for us again, and I'm looking forward to opening my Bible to the Book of Proverbs and studying Solomon's wisdom on managing our appetites.
[time=907] [MUSIC - 200 seconds]
[time=1117] >> It's great. Truly great to be standing back here in this spot. I've stood here several times before, and does anybody remember me at all? Great, great. Well, it's really nice. I consider this kind of my second family. The Lord did some very, very wonderful things for me and my family since we've been here. Now, that was almost eight years ago, and I met a dear brother out in the hall pastor.
[time=1141] And he said, have you lost any of your hair yet? And I said, no brother, I haven't lost you in my hair. I know exactly where it is. I keep it in a little basket by the sink. So I can account for every one of them that had fallen out since that time. But it's great to be back. And I love the congregational song that we all sang this morning. How marvelous. How wonderful. And my song shall ever be. How marvelous. How wonderful.
[time=1167] He's my Savior's love for me. Can you say that this morning? But you know we love him because he first loved us.
[time=1177] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=1399] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1407] Thank you, Keith. We so appreciate a song that grabs our heart and wrecks us to Christ. And there comes a time when we have to do more than simply sit. There has to be that expression, whether it be a clapping of a hands, a word of amen, but from our heart. There has to be more than us simply passively sitting there.
[time=1427] God, we want to say to you today whether it be in a song that we sing, one that we hear sung to us, that we love you. And we declare it today openly. And we're not ashamed to say, "My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine, and for thee all of the follies of sin I resigned."
[time=1452] My gracious Redeemer, my Savior, art thou. If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. God, we today say those words, not just with our lips, but from the depth of our heart, that we do love you and we worship you. And for some of us today, those words flow out musically and easily.
[time=1480] Because you have chosen in these days to bless us, and we want to stop and thank you and tell you we love you and thank you for that blessing.
[time=1492] God, for others of us, we mean those words, but they come out hard today because life has been hard.
[time=1502] We pray for those who walk through tough, tough valleys today.
[time=1509] We pray for Bob Talby and his family and the loss of his father.
[time=1514] We pray for the Haberger family and for Ken and Helen and the loss of young Andy, age 12.
[time=1522] We pray for the family of Todd Bloom as he has fought a long, hard battle, and now it is over.
[time=1530] And their hearts have the vacuum that he used to fill.
[time=1535] God, we pray that you would encourage each of those.
[time=1539] We pray for those in the hospital, for Ileana Lotz, who's been through so many surgeries, hospitalized so long, for Bob Geller, Dorothy Craig, Jim Hindle, that you would encourage these people and walk by their side.
[time=1556] We pray for Richard Zuk that his body might recover from a traumatic accident.
[time=1561] We pray today for Bernie Hay's father that he might have strength in his senior years as he battles with cancer.
[time=1569] God, we ask for spiritual strength today.
[time=1572] Many of us are fighting spiritual battles.
[time=1575] Some intensely so.
[time=1577] Some are struggling to control the appetite of sex because it now controls them.
[time=1584] Others are possessed by a fierce craving for food or for alcohol that's out of control.
[time=1592] God, today, teach us through your word to control our appetites and not be controlled by anything other than your spirit.
[time=1601] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1604] [AMEN] Today, as we study proverbs, we're looking at the topic, managing our appetites.
[time=1614] There is a new beatitude that says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for they alone have stayed on their diets."
[time=1625] We as Americans have appetites, but not simply an appetite for food alone.
[time=1631] We have an appetite for things.
[time=1633] Many of us today have a craving that doesn't deal with that which is served with a spatula or a spoon.
[time=1640] We have an appetite for that which is purchased with a credit card or a check.
[time=1646] We have an appetite for things.
[time=1648] Others of us have an appetite for alcohol.
[time=1652] We have developed a taste for that and we've gone beyond taste to a point of there is an inner craving.
[time=1658] There's an actual need for survival.
[time=1661] Appetite is a word that we often think of, stomachs that growl, but it's far more than simply an appetite for food.
[time=1669] For many of us, it is a philosophy of life.
[time=1672] Paul spoke of those whom he said, "Their end is destruction and their God is their appetite."
[time=1680] It was actually a philosophy of life of those people who said, "Life exists to gratify my desires, my appetite."
[time=1690] That is primarily Greek in its origin.
[time=1692] Long before Socrates, we call philosophers before Socrates, pre-Socratic.
[time=1699] Men who lived before Socrates and shaped that early Greek mind.
[time=1703] There was a pre-Socratic philosopher by the name of Antipas.
[time=1708] Antipas gave this ethic for life.
[time=1711] He said, "The chief duty of man is to seek pleasure and to shun pain."
[time=1718] That was the life's purpose was to find pleasure and to indulge and where there was pain to flee from it, to stay away.
[time=1727] His end, Paul said, is destruction. His God is appetite.
[time=1733] Out of that philosophy of Antipas, there's sprang up a cult, a semi-philosophy semi-religion in the Greeks called the serenaics.
[time=1742] It was the serenaics who first said, "Eat, drink, and be merry. For tomorrow you may die and not have the chance to eat, drink, and be merry."
[time=1752] So you better do it today.
[time=1755] Out of that came a young man, shaped in the philosophy of the serenaics, who could take it and he could make it understandable to the common man in a philosophy that moved throughout the Greek Empire.
[time=1768] His name was Epicurus, and we now have a philosophy since the days of the Greeks of Epicureanism, a pleasure ethic.
[time=1779] I live for my pleasure. God's word has an interesting concept about pleasure.
[time=1785] It says, "He who loves pleasure will become poor, and whoever loves wine and oil, whether it's polyunsaturated or not, will never be rich."
[time=1797] Those who love pleasure.
[time=1802] In reaction to that Greek pleasure-oriented mind, the Romans marched in, in 161 AD, they conquered the Greek peninsula, and with their conquering they observed the Greek life and they reacted out of stoicism.
[time=1817] They said, "We overcame the Greeks because of our allegiance to duty and to discipline, and they know the stoic philosophy caught on, and the stoics became very rigid, very structured, and they only lived for duty."
[time=1831] And that too was taken to an extreme of duty that they said, "It is wrong to enjoy any pleasure in life. All pleasure is wrong, the body is wrong, and in their dualistic thinking there was duty, and there was flesh, and duty was to be fulfilled for the spirit that's within a man, and the flesh with all of its desires was wrong."
[time=1856] Now out of that there has to come balance.
[time=1860] Life cannot be lived in the relentless pursuit of pleasure, nor can life be lived with the denial that God has made us to enjoy richly much of the pleasures that he's created, but somewhere there's got to come a point of balance.
[time=1877] Solomon represents a man of experience. Part of his life Solomon gave to the indulgence of every pleasure. He knew what it was to not only taste the wine but to become fully intoxicated by its influence.
[time=1893] He knew what it was like to be so materialistic that he could build kingdom on top of kingdom to where the world watched in wonder that all that he possessed.
[time=1905] He knew what it was like to indulge so sexually that every time he saw a woman who aroused him he said, "I want that one," and he took another wife or another concubine, dove in with pleasure.
[time=1920] He gratified as every instinct. Then out of reaction later in life he rejected all pleasure, and Solomon said, "I'll give myself exclusively to my work," and he became obsessive about work.
[time=1934] He became so compulsive that he only knew what it was to labor day and night and he said, "I labored, and in my sleep I would think about work." We'd now call him a workaholic.
[time=1947] Now he wants to write about balance, about managing his appetite. Solomon had a son. He wanted his son to learn from his father's lesson and not to reproduce the same mistake.
[time=1964] So in Proverbs 23 and verse 19 he writes to a son about controlling an appetite. Proverbs 23 verses 19 through 35.
[time=1983] Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path. Do not join with those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat.
[time=2000] For drunkards and gluttons become poor and drowsiness close them in rags. Listen to your father who gave you life. Do not despise your mother when she is old.
[time=2018] Buy the truth and sell it not. Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding. The father of a righteous man has great joy. He who has a wise son delights in him.
[time=2038] May your father and mother be glad. May she who gave you birth rejoice. My son, give me your heart. Let your eyes keep to my ways.
[time=2057] For a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife, a narrow well, like a bandit. She lies in weight and multiplies the unfaithful among men.
[time=2077] Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
[time=2096] Those who linger over wine. Those who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. Do not gaze at wine when it is red. When it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.
[time=2116] It bites like a snake and poisons like a viper. Your eyes will see strange sights, and your mind will imagine confusing things. You will be like one sleeping on the high seas lying on top of the rigging.
[time=2138] They hit me, you will say, but I'm not hurt. They beat me, but I don't feel it. When will I wake up so I can find another drink?
[time=2155] Solomon, the man of experience, speaks, and don't just hear the words, but hear the pathos. Hear the pleading. Here's a man who says repeatedly, "My son, listen, give me your ear. My son, listen."
[time=2176] You know there is one trap that many of us fall into, and that is the trap that says, "I've got to experience it. I've got to find out for myself. This is my life. The only way I'll really know is if I experience it."
[time=2192] There's a father pleading with a son. He's saying, "Son, don't experience it. Your son, stay away from it. Stay on the right path. Give me your heart. Guide your eyes. Give me your ear. Experience is not necessary to learn."
[time=2209] You know God has placed in this church a number of great doctors. There's 10, 12, maybe more doctors than that.
[time=2216] There are two doctors in our church that have specialized in medicine. They're in what we call obstetrics and gynecology. Neither one of those doctors have ever given birth to a baby, but they're experts. They really know how to deliver children.
[time=2232] In fact, my wife doesn't think that there's another person in America who can deliver babies other than Dr. Eastland. He's an expert, but you know he's never experienced that.
[time=2244] But you know you can learn, even though you've never personally experienced childbirth, how to deliver a child and to bring it into life.
[time=2253] We have men in our church who've served in the military. Pastor Lantland served in World War II as plane was shot down and he bobbed in the ocean. I don't need that experience. I can learn from him that there's danger.
[time=2267] Learn that there are dangers in the excess of appetites. Don't say, "I must experience it." Learn from the pathos of a father's voice as it pleads to a son about the attraction, the adventure.
[time=2282] The addiction of pleasure. Today I want to discuss four areas with you. First of all, I want to discuss with you the areas of pleasure that Solomon identifies here.
[time=2293] We're going to do that very quickly. He gives us four here in this passage and several others elsewhere. One area of attraction of pleasure that he gives us is the attraction of alcohol.
[time=2304] Verse 20, "Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat for drunkards and gluttons become poor and drowsiness, close them in rags."
[time=2319] The first pleasure identifies is the pleasure of alcohol. We'll talk about that more in a moment. But here he is giving warning to a son that there is bait, but the bait is hooked and be very careful and guard your appetite.
[time=2333] There are those out there who drink too much. There are those out there who are drunk and stay away from it all. It's a pleasure, but it is a pleasure trap.
[time=2348] You know, amongst those who are students of the Bible and some without an axe to grind and some with an axe to grind, who debate, is it ever right to drink an alcoholic beverage?
[time=2359] And there are those over here who say it's never ever right to drink alcohol. The Bible absolutely and totally condemns all drinking of alcohol.
[time=2368] Then they take word studies and they show that this Greek word means it and they've got a case that is built over here. There are those that come over here and build a case and they show where as long as you don't do this and it's okay.
[time=2381] I'm not going to be so arrogant today, say I've got it all figured out, but I do know two principles that are so clear in Scripture and I want to give those two principles to you today.
[time=2390] Principle number one is this, access is always wrong. No matter what the situation, access is always wrong. Ephesians 5, 18, B, not drunk with wine.
[time=2406] You know, I like those simple statements. You don't have to be a Greek scholar. You don't have to do linguistic studies. You don't have to understand the King's English. Don't get drunk.
[time=2415] I mean, you know, you need great exegetics. No, you don't do it. It's very clear.
[time=2421] Second thing is clear. Find Proverbs 20, verse 1, a second principle.
[time=2430] It says, wine is a mocker and beer, a brawler. Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.
[time=2442] Principle number one is this, access is always wrong. Principle number two, a little is dangerous. Even a little is dangerous.
[time=2454] You see, there's a deception in the very make up of alcohol. It is a deceiver and it makes a mocker of the user and it changes the inhibition.
[time=2464] It changes the outlook. It changes the values and it is dangerous.
[time=2471] There's a second pleasure, though, because many today would say, "Oh, give it to them. You don't drink. You just give it to them."
[time=2478] Pleasure number two, food. "Same breath," Solomon says, "do not join those who drink too much or gorge themselves on meat for drunkards and gluttons will become poor."
[time=2501] You know, if we say, "My body is the temple of God," therefore it's wrong for somebody to take alcohol and pour it into the temple.
[time=2508] Is it all right to pour cholesterol into the temple? Is it all right to pour sugar into the temple? Is it all right just to gorge it?
[time=2516] Oh, I've never taken a drink, but I'll die at 35 from all I've eaten. If the body is the temple, then it's the temple and it is.
[time=2527] Now he warns about the appetite. The appetite for food. You know, Ben Franklin said, and poor Richard's almond aqui eat to live while too many live to eat.
[time=2540] One man said, "I don't have a business address. You can find me in any doughnut shop."
[time=2546] I'm not against doughnuts. Matter of fact, if somebody wants to buy me one, I'd eat it right now. I'm hungry.
[time=2551] But, you know, do you live to eat appetite out of control?
[time=2557] You know, many times when a person opens up the refrigerator, it's very rarely out of hunger.
[time=2562] We open up that refrigerator. It says, "I'm bored. I don't have anything to do. I'll eat something." For one time, we went on vacation to Florida. Kathy and I, and the kids, and Steve and Renee long breaking their kids.
[time=2573] We met in Florida, and we're out shopping, and the girls went this way, and Steve and I went that way.
[time=2578] And we were supposed to meet right back there at five o'clock. It's five o'clock. They're not there. It's five-o' five. They're not there.
[time=2585] It's five-ten. They're not there. And I look at Steve with disgust, and I said, "If those girls aren't here in five minutes, I'm going to."
[time=2593] And I couldn't think of what I was going to do. And I said, "I'm going to eat something." How many times do you do that?
[time=2600] You're frustrated. You eat something. You're bored. You eat something. You're angry. You eat something.
[time=2606] You're lonely. You eat something. It's an appetite out of control.
[time=2611] Third pleasure, he alludes to in this passage. He speaks to strongly in other. It says, "For drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness close them in rags."
[time=2624] Do you ever get up from Thanksgiving dinner and say, "Ha, that's great meal, turkey and stuffing, pumpkin pie, the whole nine yards."
[time=2634] He just ate, and he said, "Who wants to go run five miles?" He usually goes like this. I call dibs on the sofa.
[time=2644] We waddle over to the television set, turn on the football game, and crash.
[time=2652] Excess of eating? What's it doing? It makes you drowsy. Excess of alcohol. What's it do? It makes you drowsy.
[time=2659] But more than just the effect of those, you know what it really is? There is a pleasure syndrome that says, "I live to eat. I live to drink, and I live to relax."
[time=2670] And I enjoy the drowsiness. There are many proverbs. Let me just give you a few that speak.
[time=2675] Chapter 20, just turn back to chapter 20 verse 13. Proverbs 20 verse 13. "Do not love sleep, or you will grow poor. Stay awake, and you will have food to spare."
[time=2691] Chapter 26 verse 13 says, "There's a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming in the streets. As the door turns on its hinge, so the slugger turns on his bed."
[time=2710] The slugger buries his hand in the dish. He is so lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
[time=2719] I asked one man where he worked, and everything. He said, "Oh, I don't work. I'm on the three to three shift." I'd heard of nine to five, but I never heard of the three to three shifts.
[time=2730] I said, "What's the three to three shift?" He said, "Oh, it's easy." He said, "From three in the afternoon to three in the morning, I watch TV."
[time=2738] And from three in the morning to three in the afternoon, I sleep.
[time=2743] There are many who are lazy, and they find pleasure, and they're laziness.
[time=2748] There are some other pleasures that he warns about, but not in this passage. Let me just give them to you quickly.
[time=2755] He warns about the pleasure of shopping. Now, I know he doesn't use the word shopping. He uses the word envy.
[time=2762] He says, "A content heart brings peace, but envy rots the bones."
[time=2772] You know, many of us see what somebody else have, and we say, "I've got to have that." Then we go to the mall because we're bored, or because we're lonely, and we walk, and we try to find pleasure in purchasing this.
[time=2783] One person's slave is that he's bound to a spoon. The next person's bound to the credit card.
[time=2790] There are those whose appetite for things is insatiable. Can I just warn you, even if you have the finances, to buy all of the things your heart wants?
[time=2801] You know what happens? Every year you've got to retoy yourself. You have to buy new. You have to buy bigger. You have to buy more.
[time=2810] And then he gives a final warning. One that we need to speak about. Proverbs 13, verse 2. He brings up another pleasure.
[time=2823] Strange that this one would be called a pleasure. It is the pleasure of violence.
[time=2830] 13, too. From the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things, but the unfaithful.
[time=2840] Notice this word. Have a craving. Have an appetite. Have a desire that they can't deny for violence.
[time=2849] Do you know, as a society, we have developed an appetite for violence. We cannot sit down and watch a television show if there isn't a collision and a crash and a chasing.
[time=2860] And somebody else is shot and somebody else is beaten up. Do you know there used to be safeguards on television?
[time=2867] Return with me now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. When out of the West comes, remember that? That's the beginning of the Lone Ranger.
[time=2874] Do you ever see the Lone Ranger kill anybody? You ever see the Lone Ranger shoot anybody? Never did. He always shot the gun out of their hand.
[time=2884] I'm not saying that we ought to bring back the Lone Ranger. Maybe that's too much violence. I don't know.
[time=2889] But that was 20 years ago. Now we don't have the Lone Ranger. We've got a guy who says this is a 44 Magnum.
[time=2898] It's the world's most powerful handgun. Go ahead. Make my day. And the crowd cheers. Yeah, kill him.
[time=2909] You know what? We can't get enough blood on our television sets anymore to gratify the appetite of a society that says violence. I love it.
[time=2918] Appetites out of control. Then he brings to us. In this passage, y'all, 23, not only does he bring to us the pleasures, but he brings to us the process.
[time=2937] How does it work? How does a society go from the point where we want to have value and virtues to now where we say kill him?
[time=2946] How does a society go from the point of where we look at our body as a temple? Now we say it's a toy.
[time=2953] And I want to play with your toy and you can play in my toy. How does it happen? I believe there are three steps.
[time=2963] First of all, there is attraction. There is something good about food. There's something necessary about it.
[time=2973] There's something good about purchases. There's something good about sex. God has ordained it and he's sanctified it within the commitment of marriage.
[time=2985] But to take those and distort them, how does it happen? It happens because there's, first of all, attraction.
[time=2993] There's the attractiveness of alcohol. He says, "Oh, be careful. Don't look at the wine when it's red and it sparkles in the glass."
[time=3004] And someone comes to you and says, "This is fine stuff. Notice the body. Sense the bouquet."
[time=3013] And it's presented as attractive. Proverbs 7 tells us about the immoral woman who comes and she's dressed like a prostitute.
[time=3024] Not that she is. Well, not that she's saying, "My body for your money." She is simply displaying her body saying, "I am available."
[time=3033] And that's how we dress as a society. We take our bodies and we say to society, "I am available."
[time=3043] And she says, "My husband is gone. I perfume my bed. Come, attraction."
[time=3051] There's a second step that takes place. Not only is there attraction, there's the adventuresome of association.
[time=3059] Right here it says, "Do not join those who drink too much. Eat too much. Don't go down the path of those who follow the immoral prostitute."
[time=3071] You see, though there is attraction, there's often the adventure that comes when there are others who will associate.
[time=3078] That's why the bear commercial says, "Good times. Good fish. Good friends. Good bear. It doesn't get any better than this."
[time=3086] Because they know the adventure comes when there is association. That's why it's so critical.
[time=3092] What friends you choose, if you're a teenager today, that's why your parents are concerned about the friends that you choose.
[time=3099] Because God said, "Be not deceived. Good values are corrupted by poor companions."
[time=3110] That's not only important if you're a teenager, if you're a businessman today, you have feet of clay.
[time=3116] If you live in a neighborhood today, you have temptations and you've got to guard your friendship.
[time=3121] It may be your friend that comes to you and says, "Come on. You're not doing anything. Let's go to them all."
[time=3127] In General Custer's last words, "Charge!" And off we run.
[time=3134] The adventure of association, somebody to do it with.
[time=3139] Proverbs 1, "My son beware when sinners entice thee and say, 'Come, let us lay in white.
[time=3148] We'll lurk in the dark and then we'll spring out and we'll rob and we'll divide the money." You know, many a guy who has been arrested for robbery and theft.
[time=3157] You know why they did it? It wasn't the money. It wasn't the need. It was the adventure.
[time=3163] It was the grand adventure. It was the dare that somebody put them up to you.
[time=3168] It was the mystique of it all.
[time=3173] And after there is the association, there comes the addiction.
[time=3179] There comes the point where you're hooked and you can't get out.
[time=3184] They're stuck.
[time=3187] At the end of this long discourse, it describes the man who has walked back and forth
[time=3193] and he looks like a sailor on a ship because it's always moving wobbling.
[time=3198] And at the end of it always beaten and he's abused.
[time=3201] But he says, "I'll wake up so I can find another drink."
[time=3208] And the glutton says, "Tomorrow we eat better." And the shopper says, "Next time I'll buy it."
[time=3220] Addiction. Attraction. The adventure of association.
[time=3225] And then the addiction. Slavery to sin.
[time=3229] I want to rattle off for you a third area. The problems.
[time=3233] I'm just going to give them to you. You can find them in this passage.
[time=3236] Problem number one is this.
[time=3239] It diminishes your resources.
[time=3242] Whenever your appetite is out of control, it diminishes your resources.
[time=3245] He says, "The drunk and the glutton are the ones that become poor.
[time=3248] They're clothed in rags." Secondly, it's a disgrace to your family.
[time=3252] No greater hurt is the hurt that comes to a man or a woman when their children, though they be grown, disgrace them because of appetite out of control.
[time=3262] Third problem is this.
[time=3266] It damages your perspective.
[time=3269] You don't see life real anymore. You only see it through your appetite.
[time=3272] You say, "Somebody else has it, therefore I have the right to have it." It makes no difference whether I have the money to pay for it.
[time=3278] I'll falsify the check. I'll say there's money and there's not.
[time=3281] I'll charge. I'll exceed credit limits. I'll pay minimums only.
[time=3288] Fourth problem. It deteriorates relationships.
[time=3292] Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has sorrow? Who has woe?
[time=3298] The one who is addicted to food, the alcohol, the pleasure in any of its forms.
[time=3306] The fifth problem is this one.
[time=3310] It ultimately destroys your life.
[time=3315] Proverbs say, "You will come to ruin."
[time=3322] You see the pleasures? He knows about them.
[time=3325] You see the process, how they all come down?
[time=3329] Do you see at the end of it all, all of the problems that are there?
[time=3336] But there is a way out.
[time=3338] There is a way out today because also in the pages of God's Word there is a plan for recovery.
[time=3344] Let me give you six steps as a plan for recovery.
[time=3349] One, realize you have a problem.
[time=3355] Don't try to deny it. Don't try to cover it up.
[time=3358] But admit to yourself and to God, and if necessary your family, admit that you have a problem.
[time=3365] Denying it will not make it go away.
[time=3368] Your attempts to cover it up will be found out you will be discovered.
[time=3372] You cannot build a facade that others cannot ultimately see through.
[time=3377] God says, "If we confess our sins, then he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[time=3386] and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=3389] But we must begin by realizing we have a problem, admitting it and confessing it to God."
[time=3396] Governor Neff, years ago of Texas went and he interviewed inmates in the prison.
[time=3400] He said, "I'll stay here as long as you need me to.
[time=3403] I'll talk to anyone who wants to talk to me and by the hundreds they lined up.
[time=3406] And this one said he was framed and this one said it was his parents' fault.
[time=3410] And this one said that he had to." One guy came up and said, "I did it. I was wrong and I'm really sorry.
[time=3417] And if I'm ever released from this prison, I'll do my best to make a positive contribution to society.
[time=3422] He's the only one that Governor Neff pardoned because he was the only one that realized that he said, "Why have the problem?" If you've got a vulnerability, you have a weakness.
[time=3433] It won't go away until you realize that you do.
[time=3436] Secondly, you must recognize why are you vulnerable?
[time=3440] Why is it that you're vulnerable?
[time=3442] You remember, I said the person who over eats usually doesn't overeat out of hunger.
[time=3447] One psychologist put it this way.
[time=3449] Most Americans eat too much.
[time=3452] Over eating in many cases is the consequence of personal frustration and loss of meaning in life.
[time=3460] People try to fill the void by consuming something.
[time=3465] Many of you are in credit card consumer debt trouble because you go shopping.
[time=3470] Not because you need clothing, not because you need new furniture, but because there's no meaning to life.
[time=3476] You are bored.
[time=3477] You are lonely.
[time=3478] And so you say, "I'll buy something." The second step is this.
[time=3483] You must recognize why is it you're so vulnerable?
[time=3488] That may take a bit.
[time=3509] We've had a wonderful day of worship and celebration with our special guest Blake Leopold and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3518] I have a question for you.
[time=3520] Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior?
[time=3523] If you've never done that, would you bow your head and pray this prayer with me?
[time=3527] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross from my sins
[time=3534] and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3538] I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse me.
[time=3543] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3546] If you prayed this prayer with me, would you write us and tell us the nature of the decision that you made?
