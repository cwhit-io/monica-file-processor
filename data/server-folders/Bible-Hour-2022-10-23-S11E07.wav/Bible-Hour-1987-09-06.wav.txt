[time=90] (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) In life, mistakes are inevitable.
[time=113] Henry Ford made the mistake of failing to put a reverse in his first car.
[time=119] It was a colossal mistake.
[time=122] Thomas Al-Vaddison spent over $2 million and years of his life on an invention that proved to be worthless.
[time=131] Mistakes are inevitable.
[time=134] Abraham Lincoln said, "Everybody makes mistakes, except for the man who never tries." And that is his first mistake.
[time=144] (bells ringing)
[time=155] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=158] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=160] Rick is continuing his series from Proverbs with a message he has entitled "Managing Our Mistakes." Mistakes, failure, and sin are inevitable this side of heaven.
[time=169] We cannot escape the reality of our own humanness.
[time=172] To error is indeed human.
[time=174] This does not, of course, make sin any more acceptable to God or injury more palatable to those wrong.
[time=180] We will all fail.
[time=182] We will all sin.
[time=183] However, the measure of a man is not his mistakes, but how he handles them.
[time=189] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Proverbs chapter 28.
[time=194] We will be looking at verse 13.
[time=196] Our special music today includes a song from the sanctuary choir, a solo from Kevin Rowe, an instrumental from Scott Schindler, and a solo from Marilyn Wong.
[time=213] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=221] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=226] Now, here's Rick.
[time=228] We also want to welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=232] We trust that in this hour as we worship Christ, his name will be exalted, and each of us will have a glimpse of Christ.
[time=239] Worship him.
[time=240] He is majesty.
[time=258] He is the Lord of hosts.
[time=260] The great is glory.
[time=264] Where's his name and worship him?
[time=270] In this sanctuary.
[time=275] Praise the Lord of hosts,
[time=288] proclaim his glory.
[time=293] Let his name and worship him.
[time=298] In this sanctuary.
[time=303] Sing to the Lord.
[time=307] Joyful songs of thanksgiving.
[time=313] Shout out to the sky of his safety.
[time=318] Hallelujah.
[time=323] Sing to the Lord.
[time=327] Joyful songs of thanksgiving.
[time=332] Shout out to the sun of his safety.
[time=337] Hallelujah.
[time=358] We have the glorious privilege to sound forth the praises of our Lord and to crown him Lord of all.
[time=364] I'll hail the power of Jesus' name, him number, and I've lost that page because I have a different page in front of me.
[time=372] Him number 18, I'll hail the power of Jesus' name.
[time=376] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=380] Him number 18.
[time=391] Hallelujah.
[time=399] Jesus' name.
[time=404] Sing to the Lord.
[time=411] Hallelujah.
[time=417] Sing to the Lord.
[time=422] Hallelujah.
[time=433] Then we give to every time of this semester.
[time=440] Hallelujah.
[time=539] Thank you for participating with us in singing, and I hope that the words of the songs as you join together with the masses that are with us today.
[time=548] God will be honored as we lift up His name through music.
[time=552] Continuing music now, this time listening to Kevin Roll, as he comes to minister to us, let's listen to the song that he has for us this morning.
[time=569] Playing the game, losing again, so tired of heartache from trying to win.
[time=585] You talk to my heart, and you teach me how to wait on your planet, be patient for now.
[time=598] Standing alone, broken in two, I just need a shoulder to help me get through.
[time=611] And where there is need, you can be found.
[time=618] Pick up the pieces I've left on the ground.
[time=626] When my dreams are all left behind, and a smile is so hard to find.
[time=638] In a world unsure, it's a love like yours that heals a heart like mine.
[time=660] Lessons to love, pay in my dues, searching for answers, hoping for dreams.
[time=672] I feel you near, breaking my fall, lifting me up when my courage is long.
[time=686] When my dreams are all left behind, and a smile is so hard to find.
[time=697] In a world unsure, it's a love like yours that heals a heart like mine.
[time=727] When my dreams are all left behind, and a smile is so hard to find.
[time=742] In a world unsure, it's a love like yours that heals a heart like mine.
[time=783] Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=787] Pete, it's great to be back in the fall season, choirs here, orchestras here, everybody serving together.
[time=794] Well, we've been looking forward to this day for a long time.
[time=796] Everybody kind of gets back into the routine, and that's just great.
[time=799] I'm somewhat of a routine guy like the norm.
[time=802] The special things are great, but just day by day, I agree with that.
[time=807] We do have some special events coming up, and we want to share those with you.
[time=811] Back in the winter months of January and February, we had a walk through the Bible seminar on the Old Testament.
[time=818] The response of the people was overwhelming, and the value of the seminar was equally as overwhelming.
[time=824] And as that seminar ended, we said, "Let's plan right now for a New Testament seminar."
[time=830] And so we made those plans, and we're happy to announce to you that on September 25th and 26th,
[time=836] here at Blackhawk on Friday night and Saturday morning, we will be having a walk through the Bible New Testament.
[time=843] This seminar will help you to put the life of Christ, the missionary journeys of the Apostle Paul, the contents of the entire New Testament in a logical order.
[time=852] And over 92% of the people who attend these seminars one year later can put the entire New Testament together from their memory.
[time=860] It's that meaningful, and that helpful.
[time=863] We would love to have you as a part of the walk through the Bible seminar.
[time=867] And so if you would like to, be a part of it.
[time=870] Simply write to us here at the Bible hour and ask for a registration form for the New Testament seminar.
[time=876] In a few moments, we'll give you that address.
[time=879] And then again, we have a number of special events coming.
[time=882] One of those is a guest by the name of Jim Murray.
[time=885] Well, that weekend is going to be a great weekend, Rick, with the New Testament seminar.
[time=888] That's a tremendous event in the lives of Christian people and getting knowledge of the Word of God.
[time=893] But then we're also excited that Jim Murray is going to be here on Sunday morning and evening, September 27th.
[time=899] Jim Murray is the former tenor of the Imperial's Quartet.
[time=903] He has a marvelous voice, an exciting testimony, and is a super person to be around.
[time=908] And his enthusiasm will rub off on you and his ministry will be great.
[time=913] So, set that day to side. Will you? September 27th, he'll be here in the morning and then give a full concert at 6 p.m. in our evening service.
[time=922] Well, things are moving quite well on our new building program.
[time=925] And we want to invite you on September the 13th to join us here for our morning worship service at 10.50.
[time=932] And then walk across the street to the site of our new building.
[time=936] There you'll be able to have a brief prayer and pray service for us.
[time=940] It's a chance to visually see what God is doing in providing for a new home for Blackhawk and a new home for the Bible Hour.
[time=947] During the past week, one of our television staff members went over and videotaped some of the work.
[time=952] And we'd like to share that with you right now so that you can see at least through the lens of a camera, the building of our new sanctuary.
[time=958] We're just now finishing up what are the foundations that men have put in massive amounts of concrete and steel.
[time=966] We've had to form those up with wood and they brace them so that there's a form for the concrete to be poured into.
[time=973] And once those are all finished, there should be large amounts of concrete poured right down into those forms.
[time=980] And that forms the foundation for the building.
[time=984] Coming next week on Wednesday and Thursday, the steel will be arriving.
[time=988] There's already a crane. I'm going to guess that the boom on the crane's 100 foot long.
[time=993] That cranes here on the site and where those anchor bolts are, they'll fix the steel structure that will soar 50 feet above those foundations and frame in the new building.
[time=1004] So progress is going to move very, very quickly, and we're excited about that.
[time=1009] And again, we want to invite you to come see it in person by worshiping with us on Sunday, September the 13th at 1050, and then walking across the street with us to see the new building.
[time=1021] We'll have a brief prayer and praise service right there on that site.
[time=1026] Finally, before we go back to the live morning worship service, I want to share this booklet with you.
[time=1031] Today, we'll be speaking about managing our mistakes.
[time=1035] And the measure of a man is not his mistakes, but how he handles them.
[time=1039] And God says that he handles our mistakes by forgiving us.
[time=1043] Have you experienced God's forgiveness?
[time=1046] If you have, this book will mean a great deal to you.
[time=1049] If you have not yet experienced God's forgiveness, this book is imperative to you.
[time=1054] It's written by Luis Polal.
[time=1056] Now, you may not know that name, but Luis Polal has been called the Billy Graham of Latin America.
[time=1062] He is a gifted dynamic communicator and a thorough student of God's word.
[time=1066] This is a booklet that he has put together to help us know and experience God's forgiveness.
[time=1072] And if you would like a copy, we would send one to you today if you'll simply write and ask for it.
[time=1078] The address of the Bible Hour is the Bible Hour, box 15,000.
[time=1083] Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1088] Once again, to receive this pamphlet, you write to the Bible Hour, box 15,000.
[time=1093] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1098] Well, thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1101] We'll look forward to sharing again with you next week.
[time=1103] Perhaps you could join us on the 13th at 10.50 for our morning worship service followed by the praise and prayer service at the site of our new building.
[time=1112] Thank you for being with us now.
[time=1133] [MUSIC - 192 seconds]
[time=1329] Let us pray together, that which we've just heard.
[time=1333] My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine, and for thee all of the follies of sin I resigned.
[time=1346] My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art thou.
[time=1352] If ever I love thee, my Jesus, it is now.
[time=1359] God, there's something about the melody of a song that can penetrate deeper than just a human word.
[time=1367] But there's something of your spirit, God, that penetrates even deeper than the melody of a song.
[time=1374] God, today, we ask you to penetrate and to probe.
[time=1379] You, O Lord, have described your word as a sharp, too-edged sword that pierces and divides into our thoughts and our intention.
[time=1390] God, we make ourselves vulnerable to you at this moment.
[time=1393] We ask you to penetrate with the sword of your word and to probe.
[time=1398] And as David prayed, we pray this morning, "Search me, O God, and know me.
[time=1403] Try me and find out what is within me." God, we would be known today by you.
[time=1412] God, we invite you in this morning to search us and to know us.
[time=1418] God, as you discover the needs of our hearts, some of us are struggling today with great insecurity.
[time=1426] Jobs are being threatened, some are certain to go.
[time=1431] Men and women wonder how will they provide for their family.
[time=1437] God, others today struggle with a lack of felt significance.
[time=1442] They feel as to no one are they needed.
[time=1446] To no one are they important, and they today wonder if they matter at all.
[time=1454] Others today, Father, are consumed by pain and would need to know of your relief.
[time=1463] Still others today are hostage to sin.
[time=1467] They have repeated sin so often that they have become its slave.
[time=1474] To these diverse hearts and my own, I ask you to speak today.
[time=1482] God, we love you, or Jesus, we love you.
[time=1486] We come to you today asking for your word to penetrate.
[time=1492] We ask for comfort to roti as recovers from surgery, Jim as he fight back from a heart attack.
[time=1499] The Augsburgers, the Blood Goods, the Blooms, the Guthries, all who've lost loved ones.
[time=1508] God, search our hearts, know us, comfort today in Jesus' name.
[time=1515] [AMEN]
[time=1522] Oh, Lord, you have known me.
[time=1527] You know when I sinned, stand.
[time=1531] You know the ways of my mind, my thoughts, and comprehend.
[time=1539] Before I can speak a word, you know what I have to say.
[time=1547] Your truth is wonderful, too high for me to attain.
[time=1558] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=1562] Try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=1566] And see if there is any hurting inside of me.
[time=1574] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=1578] Try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=1582] And leave me in the everlasting way.
[time=1590] Where could I run from you, if I make my bed in hell?
[time=1597] Your spirit stays with me, my soul knows that full well.
[time=1605] Wonderful are your words, your thoughts that stretch the land.
[time=1613] If I could count them all, they would outnumber the sand.
[time=1621] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=1625] Try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=1629] And see if there is any hurting inside of me.
[time=1637] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=1641] Try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=1645] And leave me in the everlasting way.
[time=1653] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=1673] Try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=1677] And see if there is any hurting inside of me.
[time=1685] Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=1689] Try me and know my anxious thoughts.
[time=1693] And leave me in the everlasting way.
[time=1705] Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=1720] A prayer of David becomes a song of life.
[time=1723] Search me, O God, and know me.
[time=1726] When God searches us, He will know us, and He will make known to us ourselves.
[time=1734] We'll discover some areas of failure, shortcomings, mistakes.
[time=1738] Our choices will be two.
[time=1740] One, to cover up.
[time=1742] Two, to confess.
[time=1745] Kathy took our three children two years ago when Adam was, O, two.
[time=1750] Rebecca, O, about four, and Rachel, five.
[time=1755] They went out on, just to buy a few things.
[time=1757] They got some brand new crayons at the drug store to color in their books with.
[time=1762] And they each got to buy a pet, a little goldfish.
[time=1766] Just, you know, those little kind that have a life expectancy of between three and six hours.
[time=1771] And they each got a little goldfish, and they each named their goldfish.
[time=1775] Adam named his goldfish Wally.
[time=1778] Well, Wally outlived all the others, and Wally is now two days old.
[time=1784] We walk upstairs, and we discover something.
[time=1787] About one foot off of the floor in the hallway, somebody has colored with crayons.
[time=1793] No letters written, just scribbly marks with crayons on the wall.
[time=1797] So a family meeting was called.
[time=1802] I presided.
[time=1804] You might have guessed that.
[time=1807] I knew who did it, but we wanted to be fair here.
[time=1810] Rachel, did you color on the wall?
[time=1813] Nope.
[time=1815] Rebecca, did you color on the wall?
[time=1818] Nope.
[time=1820] Adam, it's the right height.
[time=1823] Adam, did you color on the wall?
[time=1828] Uh-uh.
[time=1832] I said, "Adam, Mommy didn't, and I didn't." Rachel says she didn't.
[time=1839] Rebecca said she didn't.
[time=1841] Adam, you said you didn't do it?
[time=1843] Uh-uh.
[time=1844] Adam, who do you think colored on the wall?
[time=1849] Wally did it?
[time=1852] Um, I'm pretty gullible, but I didn't even buy that.
[time=1857] Have you ever said in your life when you were caught Wally did it?
[time=1863] Trying to cover it up.
[time=1865] To Proverbs 28 and verse 13.
[time=1869] And here Solomon wisely advises his sons and each of us how to manage our mistakes.
[time=1877] Proverbs 28 verse 13, it reads like this.
[time=1883] He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them,
[time=1894] finds mercy.
[time=1897] Whenever we're found out, or even if we're not, when our failures, our mistakes,
[time=1904] our sin come to the foreground, we've got two choices.
[time=1908] One, we can confess it.
[time=1910] Our two, we can cover it up and say, Wally did it.
[time=1915] Blame it somewhere else.
[time=1918] Out of this short passage, I would like to draw three very simple, clear principles that each of us already know but need to in the words of Paul be stirred up by way of remembrance.
[time=1930] Let me give you three principles today on managing our mistakes.
[time=1935] Principle number one is this one.
[time=1938] It is.
[time=1940] In life, mistakes are inevitable.
[time=1946] We all are going to make mistakes.
[time=1948] Solomon starts off.
[time=1949] He doesn't say, "Now son, if it ever happens that you make a mistake." Now he says, "He who conceals his sins." Sin is a reality in life.
[time=1960] If you want to get very, very religious in our orientation, which I do, we talk about sin.
[time=1966] That is spiritual failure before God.
[time=1969] There may be another areas of our life, things that aren't sinful, but they're just plain mistakes.
[time=1974] I forgot to take the trash out again.
[time=1977] The neighborhood dogs, cats, and squirrels thank me.
[time=1980] My wife does not.
[time=1981] I made a mistake.
[time=1982] I forgot to take out the trash.
[time=1984] A mistake.
[time=1985] A shortcoming.
[time=1987] I don't have all the abilities that I should have.
[time=1990] Sin, transgression of God's standards.
[time=1994] In life, sin, failure, mistakes are a reality.
[time=1999] They are inevitable.
[time=2001] We will all make mistakes.
[time=2003] Even the best of us will.
[time=2005] Henry Ford came out with a brand new invention.
[time=2008] He called it an automobile.
[time=2010] It was a car and it was a tremendous success.
[time=2014] They produced it.
[time=2015] They sent it out.
[time=2016] They drove it and they parked it.
[time=2019] And Henry Ford forgot to put a reverse in his first car and it was stuck there.
[time=2025] No way to back it up.
[time=2027] He had made a mistake.
[time=2029] Thomas Alva Edison, that great inventor from the state of Ohio.
[time=2034] That great inventor spent years of his life creating an invention.
[time=2041] He spent two million dollars on this invention.
[time=2044] And you know what it does?
[time=2046] Nothing.
[time=2048] Years.
[time=2049] Two million dollars.
[time=2051] It was a colossal mistake.
[time=2056] Abraham Lincoln said the man who is incapable of making a mistake is incapable of everything else.
[time=2063] The man who is not willing to make a mistake won't try anything and that is his mistake.
[time=2071] I think it was Shakespeare who said the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.
[time=2078] Our best plans often fail.
[time=2083] It is a reality of life.
[time=2085] We are all human and to air is human.
[time=2090] We, to my knowledge, have only been picketed once here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2096] And I hope it's the last time.
[time=2098] But if there was ever a time for us to be picketed, this was a good Sunday.
[time=2102] I was in Florida.
[time=2103] I didn't have to worry about that.
[time=2105] Called back on Monday, asked some of the men of the staff how things went.
[time=2108] Everything went great, but we did get the picketed yesterday.
[time=2111] I said, well, who on earth was picketing us?
[time=2114] Here it was a religious group who said we are wrong in saying that Christians still sin.
[time=2122] Once you become a Christian, you don't sin anymore.
[time=2125] The people who teach that, I'd really like to talk to their spouse.
[time=2130] You know, get their spouse over here where they can't.
[time=2133] You know, you're married to this guy or this one.
[time=2136] I won't ever tell them, do they ever make a mistake?
[time=2140] It would be an interesting insight, wouldn't it?
[time=2143] One famous theologian was confronted with one of these people with great vigor attacked him and said,
[time=2149] I believe you're wrong in saying that Christians sin.
[time=2153] I don't sin any stump on the guy's foot and the guy pushed him back and he said, oh, tell me again.
[time=2161] Put your bulletin or something here in Proverbs.
[time=2164] Turn to 1 John and let's talk about the principles of God's Word.
[time=2169] The believers ever sinned.
[time=2171] Obviously, we should not.
[time=2173] This whole point is not to somehow make sin more acceptable or more palatable.
[time=2178] But 1 John, and many of you are new to Bible study and we welcome you to find these passages with us.
[time=2184] There isn't the front of any Bible, a table of contents, and we're in 1 John.
[time=2189] Please don't confuse that with John who wrote John, but this is a shorter letter called 1 John right at the back of the Bible.
[time=2197] Verse 2 John Jude Revelation ends the Bible.
[time=2201] Chapter 1 verse 6 says, If we claim to have fellowship with him Christ, yet walk in darkness we lie and do not live by the truth.
[time=2215] Alright, here's what he's saying.
[time=2216] If we say I have fellowship with Christ and Christ is over here and he's the light, but ah, I walk in darkness over here.
[time=2225] The Bible says we're lying.
[time=2227] You can't say I'm walking with Christ who walks exclusively in the light and walk in darkness and say I'm walking with him.
[time=2233] Can't do that, you're lying.
[time=2235] You're not living by the truth.
[time=2237] Next verse takes a different concept.
[time=2239] But if we, instead of walking in the darkness, walk in the light as he Christ is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.
[time=2248] Who's the one another? All of us who are walking in the light with Christ and the blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2258] Wait a minute, if I'm walking in the light, why do I need the blood of Christ that cleanses me from all unrighteousness?
[time=2265] Look at verse 8.
[time=2267] Verse 8 tells us the reason why.
[time=2269] If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[time=2279] If we claim that we do not sin, we deceive ourselves.
[time=2285] Isn't it interesting that John had the insight to say we deceive ourselves?
[time=2290] Nobody else is deceived by that.
[time=2292] If I stood up here today and said to you, I have reached a point where I am saved, sound, sanctified and Simonized, and I don't sin anymore.
[time=2301] You wouldn't believe that.
[time=2303] You'd never believe that.
[time=2306] If anyone else stood up and said that, you wouldn't believe that.
[time=2309] You know, the only person who ever believes that, the person themselves.
[time=2314] But not only do they deceive themselves, but the truth is not in them.
[time=2321] Believers sin.
[time=2324] We are still clothed in our humanity.
[time=2327] The Apostle Paul said, "Who will deliver me from this body of death?
[time=2333] Our humanity is sinful.
[time=2336] We get a new spirit from God, but there is an old spirit and a new spirit." And Galatians chapter 5 says, "They are at war, one with another." And the spiritual battle rages on until we're delivered from this body of death.
[time=2350] We still sin.
[time=2353] Okay, great.
[time=2355] We've admitted sins inevitable, so I don't even need to try anymore.
[time=2358] I'll just live by my appetites.
[time=2360] No?
[time=2361] Read on.
[time=2362] Let me just jump down a few verses, chapter 2, verse 1.
[time=2365] My little children.
[time=2367] Now when you're 95 years old, John is 95 when he wrote this.
[time=2371] He can call any of us little children.
[time=2373] My little children.
[time=2376] I write these things to you so that you will not sin.
[time=2384] God's not writing first John and saying, "Here's a permission slip.
[time=2388] Live by your desires.
[time=2389] Do whatever you want.
[time=2390] Sin's inevitable.
[time=2391] I don't care.
[time=2392] Just give up." No?
[time=2395] He says, "I write to you so that you don't sin." Verse 2, "But if any man does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense."
[time=2406] King James says, "We have an advocate with the Father, a defense attorney.
[time=2411] Jesus Christ the righteous.
[time=2413] He is the atonement of the propitiating sacrifice for our sins and not only ours, but also for the sins of the world."
[time=2423] You know what he's picturing here?
[time=2425] We're believers.
[time=2426] We're told not to sin, but we still sin.
[time=2429] That sin comes before the judge of the universe, God Almighty.
[time=2433] And there is one who is called the accuser of the brethren.
[time=2437] His name is Satan and Revelation calls him just that, the accuser.
[time=2441] And he stands before God and he says, "God, I saw hawks this morning.
[time=2446] Did you see what he did?
[time=2447] I did God.
[time=2448] What are you going to do about that one?
[time=2450] I bring before you the sins of Rick hawks this day is accuser of the brethren.
[time=2458] And at that same moment, rising from the other table is my defense attorney.
[time=2463] Your defense attorney, the Lord Jesus Christ, who said, "Judge of the universe, heavenly Father, I died for that sin."
[time=2472] Yes, he did it, but the penalty has been paid.
[time=2476] I have paid it myself.
[time=2478] He is our defense attorney, but sin is inevitable in life.
[time=2485] Jesus is the advocate who defends us.
[time=2488] And his blood cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2493] You know, it's an important concept to remember that sin is inevitable in life.
[time=2497] If you don't have that concept, you'll struggle with two things.
[time=2500] One, accepting yourself.
[time=2502] Two, accepting others.
[time=2505] You know, it's so important that we accept the fact that mistakes are inevitable in life.
[time=2510] Newspapers often make mistakes.
[time=2513] They can be hilarious.
[time=2515] One time, a Kansas City newspaper was reporting on a highly, highly known wedding in their town.
[time=2522] Everybody who was somebody was to be there.
[time=2524] I wasn't there.
[time=2525] Neither were you, but this was quite the wedding.
[time=2527] And the newspaper made the mistake.
[time=2529] They printed in their report the next day that the roses were punk.
[time=2535] Oh, that hurt the bride's feeling.
[time=2538] So the next day they apologize and said, "We apologize that yesterday we said the roses were punk.
[time=2544] We meant to say that the noses were pink." Some days you just do better to give up.
[time=2552] The American marketing newsletter printed this statement.
[time=2556] In last month's newsletter, we printed the name of her bestman under the picture of Bob Fernard.
[time=2563] But since the article was about Ed McDonald, just forget the whole thing.
[time=2571] Mistakes are inevitable.
[time=2573] Can you accept yourself as a human being that you will make mistakes?
[time=2579] You really will, you will fail.
[time=2582] You will err.
[time=2585] This is baseball season.
[time=2586] One of the greatest batters of all time was a man by the name of Ted Williams.
[time=2592] And swing a bat.
[time=2594] His lifetime batting average was one of the greatest in baseball history.
[time=2600] 344.
[time=2605] One of the greatest batters of all time.
[time=2607] You know what that means?
[time=2608] One out of three times he got a hit.
[time=2610] Two out of three times he failed.
[time=2613] And he's one of the greatest of all time.
[time=2617] Failure in life is inevitable.
[time=2621] Will you accept yourself?
[time=2624] Will you accept the others in your life?
[time=2628] Men, can you accept your wife when she makes a mistake?
[time=2632] Or do you find it necessary to say, "Oh, you never did have a sense of direction."
[time=2638] Wives?
[time=2640] Can you accept your husbands with their failures, their shortcomings?
[time=2648] Bosses?
[time=2650] Can you accept those employees who perform less than perfectly?
[time=2656] Employees?
[time=2657] Please, the 55 of you who work here at Black Ops.
[time=2660] Can you accept those who are over you, who are less than perfect?
[time=2666] You see, understanding the fact that mistakes are inevitable is critical to our acceptance of ourselves and others.
[time=2674] The second principle that comes to us out of this passage is the more important one.
[time=2681] It is this.
[time=2683] Confession is imperative.
[time=2686] Notice it says, "He who conceals his sin does not prosper,
[time=2695] and whosoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy."
[time=2702] Plus it is the man who always fears the Lord, but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
[time=2710] You see, whenever we make a mistake, whenever we sin, we have these two opposite choices.
[time=2717] Cover up or confession.
[time=2720] There is a four-fold step to sin.
[time=2723] I've given it to you before, allow me to repeat it.
[time=2726] In every sin, there are these four steps.
[time=2728] Step number one is attraction.
[time=2730] If Eve went into the garden in there, the serpent said, "Notice the fruit, it is good." She saw that it was good.
[time=2737] She was attracted.
[time=2739] Aiken walked through the city of Jericho.
[time=2742] Its walls had collapsed, but God had commanded to take no plunder, and Aiken saw a wedge of precious metal and a Babylonian garment that was valuable, and they were attracted to his eye.
[time=2756] David went on a night when he couldn't sleep to the edge of his balcony, and he overlooked his kingdom, and he glanced down into the next courtyard, and there she was, Bathsheba bathing.
[time=2770] Beautiful.
[time=2772] He was attracted.
[time=2774] Attraction is the first step in sin.
[time=2778] The second step is contemplation within the heart.
[time=2782] David contemplated and he inquired, "Who is she?
[time=2785] Could I have her?
[time=2786] Could she be mine?
[time=2787] Could I possess her?" Aiken saw the wedge of gold in the Babylonian garment, and his own words were, "I coveted them." Contemplated in his heart.
[time=2800] Eve saw the fruit, and she was not only attracted, she said it was desirable to the eyes.
[time=2806] It was what she wanted.
[time=2809] The third step is commitment.
[time=2812] Eve took the fruit, and she ate it.
[time=2815] And he then, Adam, took it and ate it also.
[time=2819] Aiken saw it.
[time=2821] He coveted it, and he said, "I took it." David saw her.
[time=2827] He coveted her.
[time=2828] He lusted, and he said, "I must have her." And he took Bathsheba.
[time=2833] The fourth and final step is cover-up.
[time=2837] Adam and Eve ate the fruit they sinned, and they saw for the first time their nakedness and their sinfulness, and they took leaves, and they tried to cover it up, and they went and they hid in the bushes as though God would never see.
[time=2850] They said, "We'll cover it up." Aiken took what he had stolen, and now it was in his possession, but he might be found out, so he took it, and he covered it up, and he hid it in a hole in his tent, and he put the dirt back over it.
[time=2865] David finds out that Bathsheba is pregnant, and she calls and says, "I am pregnant, and David sends for Uriah to bring them home, hoping they'll be together, and Uriah will say, "This is my child, but Uriah won't compromise." So David has him killed in cover-up.
[time=2883] Whenever we sin, we will follow those patterns.
[time=2887] Attraction, contemplation, commitment, cover-up.
[time=2893] The Word of God says, "He who covers his sins will not prosper.
[time=2899] Truth and time go hand in hand." But he who confesses it will find mercy.
[time=2912] In this passage, there are given to us two steps in confession.
[time=2917] The first is to reveal it.
[time=2919] The one who confesses it means to reveal it, is to uncover it, to declare it openly.
[time=2927] The second step is to renounce it.
[time=2930] You see, it's not just enough.
[time=2932] We say, "I did it." There are those today who are sinful and will admit with openness and almost defiant, "Yes, I do that." It's not enough that we say, "Yes, I do that." We must also renounce it.
[time=2947] Our more contemporary Word would be to denounce it and to say, "It is wrong, it is sinful, and I renounce it.
[time=2953] I move away from it." If you have a claim to an estate, someone has left you an inheritance.
[time=2962] If you renounce it, that means you walk away from it and claim no partnership with it.
[time=2968] The Bible says that when we sin, we are not only say, "Yes, God, I did it, but we are to renounce it." The New Testament uses the Word more often to repent.
[time=2978] It means to turn away from it.
[time=2982] There's an important principle that's found elsewhere in Proverbs that brings light on this subject.
[time=2987] The question is, when we confess our sins, to whom do we confess?
[time=2993] I think it is important and obvious that we always confess our sins first to God our Heavenly Father.
[time=3001] Because sin is a transgression of his standard.
[time=3004] David, when he sin said against thee and the only O God, have I sinned.
[time=3008] God is the one who is offended by sin.
[time=3011] But secondly, we must confess it to injured parties.
[time=3014] Look back into chapter 17 of Proverbs and the ninth verse.
[time=3018] Proverbs 17, 9.
[time=3023] It says, "He who covers over an offense promotes love, and whoever repeats the matter separates close friends." You say, "Wait a minute, Rick, you just read to me from chapter 28.
[time=3035] Don't cover it up." And now you say in chapter 17 it says, "Cover it up, that promotes love." You need to understand the context and the situation.
[time=3044] Chapter 28 is telling us how to deal with sin when we are guilty.
[time=3048] And if you are guilty of sin, you must go and confess it to God and you must confess it to the offended person.
[time=3055] But if you are the person who's been offended and someone comes to you and says, "I am sorry, will you forgive me?" We are to cover up their sin.
[time=3067] We are to forgive them and to conceal it.
[time=3070] And don't allow it to spread any further.
[time=3072] Noah was drunk, he was naked, he was wrong.
[time=3077] And in his tent he was there a disgrace.
[time=3081] But his sons picked up a blanket and they walked backwards and they covered it up and they concealed his disgrace.
[time=3092] The principle is this, sin must be confessed to offended parties and then it is to be covered up.
[time=3100] Occasionally someone will come to me and they'll say, "I just found out so and so did this.
[time=3106] Why wasn't this made known?" Because they confessed it to God and to the offended party and it was for no one else to know.
[time=3119] Love covers over sin.
[time=3126] But you must confess it to God, to the offended people and then renounce it.
[time=3134] You must confess it.
[time=3136] Glory 10 Boom once said, "The blood of Jesus never once cleansed a sinner of an excuse." We must confess it.
[time=3148] The third principle is equally as important.
[time=3151] It is this one.
[time=3153] Forgiveness is essential.
[time=3156] Verse 13 of chapter 28, "Whoever confesses and renounces their sin
[time=3162] finds mercy." Forgiveness.
[time=3167] The word mercy means undeserved favor from God.
[time=3173] It is of God's mercy that God does not give us what we deserve.
[time=3177] We deserve death.
[time=3179] We deserve hell.
[time=3180] We deserve eternal separation from God.
[time=3183] And out of His mercy, God gives us what we don't deserve.
[time=3187] And then out of His grace, God gives us what we don't deserve in blessing.
[time=3191] Out of mercy, He forgives sin and cancels punishment.
[time=3195] Out of grace, He gives eternal life and new life in Christ.
[time=3200] But this passage says, "It's to the one who confesses that mercy is extended."
[time=3209] A young boy of 19 had twice committed a crime in Napoleon's army.
[time=3213] And for this, he was sentenced to death.
[time=3216] His mother came to the emperor and pleaded for her son.
[time=3219] And Napoleon said, "He must die.
[time=3221] He has committed this crime twice." And the mother said, "I beg you to give Him mercy." Napoleon said, "He does not deserve mercy." The mother wisely said, "Yes, if He deserved it, it would not be mercy."
[time=3240] Oh, today, through Jesus Christ, God gives us mercy.
[time=3245] Don't deserve it, but He gives it to us.
[time=3249] Forgiveness is essential.
[time=3252] We must have God's forgiveness.
[time=3257] Jesus Christ died to pay for that forgiveness.
[time=3262] But we must confess Him as Savior and confess ourselves as sinners in need of His forgiveness.
[time=3274] Forgiveness is essential.
[time=3278] It's not only essential from God, but it's essential from one another.
[time=3283] Whether you be the one to receive or give mercy, it is equally as essential.
[time=3289] If you need someone's forgiveness, you must go to them and ask them their forgiveness.
[time=3294] If not, it will be a skeleton in your closet whose bones will rattle through your life.
[time=3301] Joshua's, excuse me, Joseph's brother sold him in the slavery.
[time=3306] And every time something went wrong in their life, the skeleton rattled in the closet.
[time=3312] And they said, "Ah, it's because of what we've done to Joseph that these things have befallen us."
[time=3321] Or you may be the one who needs to give mercy.
[time=3325] We pray often in the Lord's Prayer, our Father, who art in heaven, how long be thy name?
[time=3332] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done right here on earth just like it is in heaven.
[time=3337] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses.
[time=3344] Conditionally, Lord, just as we forgive others, what we've said in that prayer is, "God, I only expect your forgiveness to be as great as mine." We must be great forgivers.
[time=3355] If we are to be the recipients of mercy, then mercy must be given.
[time=3363] A preacher by the name of Peter Miller had an undeserved enemy in his life.
[time=3368] This man heckled him, mocked him, followed him, and taunted him throughout all of his ministry.
[time=3375] But this man was not only a cancer on the church, but this man became a traitor to America.
[time=3381] He was convicted and tried, and he was to be put to death.
[time=3386] But Peter Miller went to George Washington and asked forgiveness for this man.
[time=3393] And Washington said, "I know you've come a long way to plead for your friend, but I cannot pardon him."
[time=3400] Miller said, "My friend, I've never had a worse enemy in my life than that man."
[time=3408] Washington said, "You came today and you pleaded for your worst enemy for mercy.
[time=3414] How can I deny it?" Would you seek mercy for your worst enemy?
[time=3422] I must ponder that one in my own heart.
[time=3425] Mercy is essential.
[time=3429] Let me very quickly give you five principles about asking forgiveness.
[time=3434] We are not good at these in our society.
[time=3437] Principle number one, ask forgiveness.
[time=3440] Don't assume it.
[time=3441] Don't assume because people seem like they're okay on the outside that you don't need to say, "I am sorry.
[time=3447] Will you forgive me?" Never assume it.
[time=3449] Always ask.
[time=3450] They may be dying on the inside.
[time=3452] Principle number two, accept total responsibility.
[time=3457] You know, many of our apologies are more like indictments.
[time=3460] Honey, I'm really sorry.
[time=3462] I want to apologize that I got angry when you made me mad yesterday.
[time=3466] Oh, that's a good one.
[time=3469] I mean, she's going to feel better right now that you apologize.
[time=3473] You creep.
[time=3474] Accept total responsibility.
[time=3477] I was wrong.
[time=3479] Will you forgive me?
[time=3480] Principle number two, acknowledge they're hurt.
[time=3482] Don't ever say, "Oh, it'll be okay.
[time=3484] It may hurt deeply." Be patient.
[time=3486] Acknowledge they're hurt.
[time=3488] Number three, assume a cautious response.
[time=3491] Usually those of us who are making apologies are not making them for the first time.
[time=3495] And they may need some time to trust you again.
[time=3498] Principle number five, always make restitution.
[time=3503] Jesus insisted upon it.
[time=3505] Always make restitution.
[time=3508] In life, mistakes are inevitable.
[time=3512] Confession isn't true.
[time=3514] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of music through our church musicians
[time=3524] and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3528] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your spiritual walk with God and the idea that you need to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray with you.
[time=3539] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3541] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3548] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3551] I ask you to come in and forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3555] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3559] If you prayed that prayer this morning, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3563] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3571] To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled Experiencing God's Forgiveness,
