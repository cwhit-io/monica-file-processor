[time=117] Truth and time always go hand in hand.
[time=122] Four high school students were smitten with a severe case of spring fever.
[time=127] They skipped the morning classes and showed up at noon with this excuse.
[time=132] Boy, teacher, we're sorry we missed the test, but we had a flat tire.
[time=137] Teacher smiled and said, "I understand.
[time=140] We'll take your test now." Each of you sit in four different corners of the room.
[time=145] Now your first question is this.
[time=147] Which of the tires was flat?
[time=151] They were found out.
[time=153] Truth and time always go hand in hand.
[time=157] (music)
[time=168] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=173] Thank you for joining us.
[time=174] Rick's message today is entitled "Managing Our Integrity" and is taken from Proverbs chapter 26.
[time=181] Truth and time go hand in hand.
[time=183] Each of us daily faces the temptation to protect our reputation by deception, either covering
[time=189] up our mistakes or by exaggeration of our accomplishments.
[time=192] Tragically, the reputation we want to protect is damaged even more by the deception.
[time=198] Managing our integrity is the theme of study in Proverbs, a timely study for politicians,
[time=204] businessmen, and individuals of all walks of life.
[time=209] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Proverbs chapter 26.
[time=214] We will be looking at verses 24 through 28.
[time=217] Our special music today includes a song from the Sanctuary Choir, a solo from Kathy Hawks,
[time=226] and Brian Lozen.
[time=229] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=237] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=243] Now here's Rick.
[time=244] Bible hour, as we come by way of television into hospital rooms, homes, and even prison
[time=250] cells, it's our purpose today to praise God and to celebrate the fact that Jesus Christ
[time=256] is alive.
[time=279] God, as we hear the empty tune, more than a question, more an empty room.
[time=293] Two eyes of faith, we look and we can see our victory.
[time=302] We celebrate, we celebrate, He's invisible kingdom, we celebrate the special gift of His
[time=313] life, we celebrate the land that is worth it, the one who was born to rise, we celebrate,
[time=323] the one who was born to rise, the one who was born to rise, the one who was born to rise
[time=340] and we pray that the one who was born to rise, the one who was born to rise, the one who
[time=352] was born to rise, we celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, He's invisible kingdom, we
[time=368] celebrate, the special gift of His life, we celebrate the land that is worth it, the
[time=374] one who was born to rise, we celebrate, we celebrate, He's victory in our lives.
[time=388] Once we step into His kingdom, we must celebrate, we celebrate, He's invisible kingdom, He's
[time=401] civil faith, the special gift of His life, we celebrate the land that is worth it, the
[time=412] one who was born to rise, we celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, we
[time=423] celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, what a privilege it is to celebrate the
[time=442] great fact that Jesus Christ died for our sins, gave us victory over sin, promises eternal
[time=448] life, Calvary covers it all, a marvelous hymn, 144, hymn number 144, we'll sing the first
[time=456] third and fourth stanzas together, 144.
[time=482] We celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate, we celebrate,
[time=790] we forgive our debt to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for the
[time=815] love of God, the love of God, the love of God, the love of God, the love of God,
[time=865] we are so thankful you've joined us today for the Bible hour. We have such a joyful
[time=871] experience here at Blackhawk worshiping the Lord praising His name and it's an equal joy to be able to extend that worship service to you by way of television and we really appreciate you joining us today. Along with Pete and myself we have Pastor George Lantman who is a part of
[time=887] our staff here at Blackhawk who has a number of responsibilities one of which is directing the
[time=893] super 60s ministry and we're fast approaching the ninth anniversary. George congratulations on nine
[time=899] tremendous years of outreach to the senior adults and please tell our viewers about super 60s and the anniversary celebration coming up. Thank you Rick. Yeah this year we've got the
[time=910] ninth anniversary and it's going to be a big time we trust. We're looking for 700 people and Dr. Stanley Tam is coming. He's a unique person. He actually turned his business over to God.
[time=924] He owns a U.S. plastic business in Lima, Ohio and he'll be here with a very interesting speech I know
[time=931] because he has much to say about his life. Well you know he was here a number of years ago and I
[time=938] was so impressed and encouraged that I'm excited for our people to have the chance of hearing him again. The date and the time of the anniversary would be helpful to the viewers. That probably would would. Yes October the 2nd at 10 o'clock in the morning we're going to have a group of people
[time=954] right here in this room and we're just going to have a great time. We'll have special music in addition to Dr. Stanley Tam. And every week we have super 60s it's on Friday morning at 10 o'clock
[time=965] and you have a variety of programming different things every Friday. Yes we do. We try to keep it interesting but yet something that will meet the needs of the senior adult community and we're open to all of the people not just the people here at Blackhawk but we bring people in from all over the community. Well actually there are more people who come who aren't from Blackhawk than who are isn't that the case? Yes I think last year the year before we had people from 95 different churches.
[time=991] Boy that's exciting. Well if you're a senior adult between 55 and 105 we want to encourage you
[time=998] to be a part of super 60s every Friday but particularly on October the 2nd for the 9th anniversary and
[time=1005] having the privilege of hearing Stanley Tam tell of his faith in Christ and how God has honored his
[time=1011] life. We want to encourage you to be a part of that. Also coming up is what we call a walk through
[time=1018] the Bible Seminar. It is an opportunity for you and for me to put the entire New Testament together
[time=1024] clearly in our mind. Do you have trouble understanding some of the chronology and history of the New
[time=1030] Testament? Maybe you're not quite sure where a person like the Apostle Paul and his ministry how
[time=1036] that fits together with Barnabas and his ministry are which came first the first Corinthians letter
[time=1043] or did the book of Revelation come first? How does the New Testament fit together? This seminar is a
[time=1050] high energy exciting way of studying God's Word and putting the New Testament together in one
[time=1057] brief weekend. Over 90 percent of the people who attend these seminars a year later can put together
[time=1063] the entire New Testament from memory. I'm not saying letter by letter word by word but concepts.
[time=1069] We want to include you and if you would like to be a part of the walk through the New Testament seminar then you simply need to write us and ask for a registration form and a little later we'll
[time=1080] give you the address to which you can write. Also coming up is a special music concert in just about
[time=1086] one week. Yes Rick that's going to be a great weekend. If you're familiar with quartets you'll recognize the name the Imperial's quartet. They've been around for a number of years and the tenor in that quartet is Jim Murray. Jim Murray just recently left that group to start a ministry on his own
[time=1102] and he's going to be with us on Sunday all day September 27th. He'll be participating in our
[time=1108] morning worship service and then a full concert on Sunday evening at 6 p.m. once again that Sunday
[time=1114] September 27th at 6 o'clock right here in the Black Hawk Baptist Church. Set aside that time
[time=1120] and come and join with us for a great evening of music. Thank you Pete. Before we go back to our
[time=1126] morning worship service we also want to share a booklet with you entitled forgiveness. Those of
[time=1132] you who are with us last week remember that out of the book of Proverbs we discovered three important principles the third of which is that forgiveness is essential in life. It's important that you know
[time=1145] and feel and experience God's forgiveness. It's also essential that you give and extend forgiveness
[time=1152] to others. This booklet is a biblical study by Luis Palau. He has been called the Billy Graham of
[time=1159] Latin America. He is a dynamic communicator and a good student of the scriptures. Many people today
[time=1166] are suffering great guilt, anxiety, broken relationships because of a lack of forgiveness.
[time=1172] We want to help you in that area by extending this booklet to you. A moment ago I told you we would
[time=1178] give you the address and here it is. You can write now for either the registration form for walk through the Bible seminar or the booklet on forgiveness or both. The address is the Bible
[time=1190] hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana. The zip code is 46815. Once again that's the Bible hour box 15,000
[time=1201] Fort Wayne, Indiana. 46815. Thank you Pete and now as we do go back to our morning worship service
[time=1210] you'll have the privilege of hearing from Brian Losen as he ministers to us today through song.
[time=1231] This blender filled and bright came the king and he came to bring to the world new life and life.
[time=1248] What grace is this that brought my Savior down that made him leave his glorious throne
[time=1262] and throne. The one who made the earth the sky and sea. Who put the stars in every galaxy.
[time=1276] What condescension oh how can it be. What shame he suffered oh what agony.
[time=1292] And then the death he died for sinners crucified. What grace is this. What grace is this.
[time=1321] Oh the boundless race of God seen in Christ the Lord. Greater than all the sin of man and it's
[time=1346] really now. What grace is this that brought my Savior down that made him leave his glorious throne
[time=1365] and throne. No one who made the earth the sky and sea. Who put the stars in every galaxy.
[time=1379] What condescension oh how can it be. What shame he suffered oh what agony.
[time=1395] And then the death he died for sinners crucified. What grace is this. What grace is this.
[time=1412] What condescension oh how can it be. What shame he suffered oh what
[time=1424] agony. And then the death he died for sinners crucified. What grace is this. What grace is this.
[time=1455] Thank you Brian let's take a moment to pray together and thank God for his grace. God as we
[time=1465] bow before you today. The word grace carries so much meaning but perhaps is meaningless to many
[time=1473] of us because we've never explored you. We don't know your word. But God today we thank you that
[time=1481] out of grace Jesus Christ left heaven came to earth and died on the cross and all that for me.
[time=1490] God we are humbled today and we hear a song and our hearts do swell up with gratitude
[time=1500] and we thank you today for your grace and we live by it today and we even are so bold as to ask for
[time=1510] more. God we want to praise you today and yet that's out of grace. We recognize that there's not a
[time=1517] word that we can say not a tune that we can sing that glorifies your name but that your spirit
[time=1524] doesn't give us that opportunity. God so many today are searching for purpose in life. Many of
[time=1532] their teenagers have heard a song that says I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
[time=1539] God may there be those today who discover in Jesus Christ there is a purpose in life.
[time=1543] There is something to live for. God many of us today in the middle of life are questioning values.
[time=1551] We're toying with defection. God by your grace give us loyalty. God by your grace we ask you to
[time=1560] speak to men and women who know Christ but who live empty lives spiritually. Shallow existence
[time=1569] thin veneers of true character. God today out of your grace we had asked you to speak.
[time=1576] God we would ask you to speak a word of encouragement to those who carry chronic burdens.
[time=1584] Think of Steve as he battles arthritis. Marv as he battles pancreatitis. Marv Daggetz as he fights
[time=1592] an unknown enemy. Oh God we ask you to encourage those hearts. We ask you to encourage the heart
[time=1598] of a wife who would be found faithful but her husband is not. God we'd pray for a man who would
[time=1606] want to walk with integrity but in his family there's no allegiance to Christ. God out of your
[time=1612] grace give them a burden to persevere spiritually. God today we would pray that you'd give us a
[time=1619] burden for truth. Your word tells us to find truth and to sell it not. God give us that spirit
[time=1627] that we hunger for your word and for you and we do not depart from it ever let alone easily.
[time=1634] Father today out of your grace we are blessed. We want to thank you for this country and 200 years
[time=1642] of constitutional freedom. God you have poured out your grace on America and we are thankful.
[time=1648] God we pray this week uniquely for the youth of our nation and for those who minister to teenagers
[time=1656] for John and Amy as they work here at Black Hog and with those who stand by their side the
[time=1662] chaplains and the emirics and the reasons and partners in working with youth for Denny and Debbie
[time=1669] as they work with young people through crusade our campus life and for campus crusade and
[time=1676] an university fellowship God give them an impact with our nation's youth. May this next generation be a generation of integrity a generation who walks in the truth for it's in Jesus' name that we
[time=1689] pray. Amen. George Sweetin tells the story of Dr. Martin Stason. He was a professor at Vanderbilt
[time=1701] University of Mathematics and he began his first examination with freshman students each semester
[time=1708] with these words. Students today you are not taking one examination you're taking two
[time=1715] examinations. One is an examination in a course called trigonometry. The second is an examination
[time=1724] in a course called honesty. Class there are many many fine people who could not pass this test
[time=1734] in trigonometry but there are no fine people who cannot pass a test in honesty. If you must choose
[time=1745] today to pass only one test then choose today to pass the test of honesty.
[time=1752] My what good advice not only for freshman students who are shaking with a pencil in their hand
[time=1760] before trigonometry tests they look at it they don't know the top from the bottom but they now have a philosophy that will guide them through life better than a mathematical formula. We as a
[time=1771] nation are slipping and our love and our allegiance for truth and for integrity. Do you know that it
[time=1778] is now a legal deduction according to the IRS for you to claim tax exemption for money or expenses
[time=1786] that you incurred in the form of paying out a bribe or a kickback? That is a legal deduction
[time=1793] as long as neither you nor the person to whom you paid the bribe or kickback was ever criminally
[time=1799] prosecuted for that. That is legal today. In 1924 a magazine company sent out one hundred one dollar
[time=1811] bills and said with the explanation we are sending you this dollar bill because your account has
[time=1818] been overcharged none of those people had an account with that magazine. They were doing a
[time=1824] survey. 27 people in 1924 said you don't know us a dollar here it is back. The same magazine in
[time=1833] 1971 sent out a dollar to 100 people said we have made a mistake on your account we owe you a dollar
[time=1842] they owed them no dollar. 13 people said you owe us no dollar. Declining character in America.
[time=1853] Is it any wonder that Spiro Agnew then as vice president of the United States would decline
[time=1859] to report all of his income? Why should he be expected to be a man of integrity? One 87 percent
[time=1867] of us countrymen have no integrity. Why should Richard Nixon say sure I knew all about Watergate?
[time=1875] I planned it. When a nation says we don't live by integrity integrity it is a lost character
[time=1886] in America. Solomon writes to a sign about managing life and he says manage your integrity. If you
[time=1899] have a Bible with you today I invite you to open yours. As I turn in mind to Proverbs chapter 6
[time=1906] we've been studying through the book of Proverbs. In this it is a father Solomon writing to a son
[time=1913] giving guidance for life but it is more than that. This is the very word of God inspired by his spirit
[time=1921] written to generations timeless advice. The jewel of integrity is never found out of fashion.
[time=1933] In the wardrobe of God the jewel of integrity is never found to be out of fashion. Proverbs
[time=1942] chapter 6 verse 12 gives to us a character study in a man who's lost integrity. Chapter 6 verse 12
[time=1951] a scoundrel and villain who goes about with a corrupt mouth who winks with his eye, signals
[time=1961] with his feet, motions with his fingers, who plots evil with deceit in his heart. He always
[time=1972] stirs up dissension. Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant. He will suddenly be
[time=1982] destroyed without remedy. There are six things the Lord hates. Seven that are detestable to him.
[time=1995] Hotty eyes, a lying tongue, hands the shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes,
[time=2007] feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies,
[time=2017] a man who stirs up dissension amongst his brothers. Throughout the book of Proverbs almost every
[time=2028] chapter speaks of the value of integrity and denounces deception and deceit. But in this passage
[time=2036] we are given a full character study. Let me share with you three different developments here.
[time=2042] First of all the development of the deceiver. It begins within the heart. If you look at this
[time=2049] passage it talks about the mouth and the hands and the fingers and the feet. But when you come to verse 14 it actually tells us how a deceiver is developed. It says verse 14. He plots evil with
[time=2062] deceit in his heart. It was Jesus who said out of the heart come the issues of life. There were
[time=2072] those in the Jesus day who wanted to say that it was a man's environment that contaminated him.
[time=2079] Maybe it was something that he ate, something they touched. He somehow became ceremonially unclean. That religious defilement led to corruption of character. Jesus said not so. But it's what's
[time=2091] inside of a man and he wasn't speaking in terms of gender. It was what was inside of humanity
[time=2097] that was corrupting. And it was out of the heart that Jesus said came every wicked thought,
[time=2103] every deceit, every lie that came from within. Many of you as college students are studying classes
[time=2111] in behavioral science and you'll come across the name B. F. Skinner. Skinner will write about
[time=2117] human dignity and freedom and beyond human dignity and freedom. And Skinner's philosophy is this
[time=2124] and it is the dominant view of the behaviorless today. That man is neither good nor bad. He is
[time=2131] nothing in and of himself but it is his environment that shapes his character. Therefore if you want
[time=2139] to change a behavior you simply must change the environment to be sure. Environment has much to do
[time=2149] with behavior. But whether you can take an individual and give him the best of behavioral
[time=2156] environments or the worst you'll discover that each possesses a seed of sin within their own heart.
[time=2164] And sin comes from within me. That's why the apostle Paul said, oh wretched man that I am,
[time=2174] who will deliver me? Do you know what Paul wanted deliverance from? He didn't want deliverance from Rome. He didn't want deliverance from Jewish people who hated him. He did not want deliverance from
[time=2185] physical infirment. He wanted deliverance from himself. Himself. Sin comes from within the heart.
[time=2194] But in the development of the seaver it goes goes further than the heart. It moves. If you ever
[time=2200] notice you get a splinter in your hand and if there's infection in that splinter a red line
[time=2206] begins to move. It is a line that moves flowing through the blood system because as the heart
[time=2213] sends forth that blood it picks it up and it carries it throughout the system. Once deception
[time=2220] is in the heart it is moved through that spiritual heart throughout the whole person and the next
[time=2227] place it moves is to the mouth. Chapter 6 verse 12, a scoundrel and villain who goes about with a
[time=2235] corrupt mouth. Deception primarily moves to the words. Chapter 26 in many ways is a parallel.
[time=2246] We'll have you go back and forth between 6 and 26 often. But look at chapter 26 verse 24.
[time=2254] A malicious man disguises himself with his lips. Isn't that an interesting metaphor? He disguises
[time=2263] himself with his lips. He doesn't disguise himself with a wig. He doesn't disguise himself with
[time=2269] spectacles or a wardrobe but he disguises his real identity with his lips. The next phrase,
[time=2277] but he harbors deceit in his heart, in his heart. But it moves from the heart to the lips. Verse 25
[time=2287] though his speech is charming do not believe him for seven abominations fill his heart.
[time=2294] The heart but how that heart there comes one who can disguise that heart with lips and someone who
[time=2300] can speak charmingly. You know we've learned as a society to say what people want to hear
[time=2307] to put up the veneer and the facade in the masquerade but none do it more skillfully than those who can
[time=2314] do it with their lips. Words have an amazing power to deceive. I just wanted to share with you that I
[time=2320] want to contest this past week and this is true. I want a new power fishing boat. I'd like to take
[time=2328] many of you out fishing with me on my new power fishing boat. I got a personal letter in the mail
[time=2335] this week. It said Dear Pastor Richard Hawkins. I knew it was from a close friend. We are so pleased
[time=2343] to announce that you have won a new power fishing boat. Oh that excited me because I thought power
[time=2352] fishing boat. I've got this 24 foot bass boat in my mind. You know those big high seats where you
[time=2358] have to buckle yourself in so you're pulling in the big one you know and a power boat. You know maybe 50, 80 horse power. We need to do a little skiing behind it Kathy. You know just power fishing
[time=2369] boat. I want it. Free. Few little details. First it'd really be good if I was to buy 1,000 ballpoint
[time=2384] pins that said Pastor Richard Hawkins. Black Hawk Baptist Church. Did I think I could use a thousand
[time=2392] of those? Well they did their homework. They knew how big the church was and they just wanted me to
[time=2398] give each of you a pin today from Pastor Richard Hawkins.
[time=2403] Thousand pins, three dollars a piece. But the good news is even if I don't buy them,
[time=2410] I didn't by the way, I still get my power fishing boat free. But of course I do have to pay postage
[time=2419] and handling. Oh how much is postage and handling on my power fishing boat? Well Mr. Hawkins
[time=2428] we don't know because we just have a relationship with the manufacturer. They send it and they'll
[time=2434] bill you COD. Oh any ideas? Well it's guaranteed not to exceed 89.95. First that said well you know
[time=2443] you deliver in this 24-foot boat with a 50 horse power. Well tell me a little bit about my boat.
[time=2451] What do you want to know about your boat? Well how long is it? Well it's 10 foot.
[time=2459] What's it made out of? What's inflatable?
[time=2462] Oh you mean like a raft? Well yeah yeah that yeah you can call it that. Well tell me about the power.
[time=2472] Well it's a three horse power trolling motor battery not included.
[time=2480] Now that's what our society calls a power fishing boat. A raft. But you know what? There's someone
[time=2490] who has learned the power of words. The power of words. It was a boat. It did have power.
[time=2502] But it was a deception. Do you know that it would cost $89 to have that power fishing boat
[time=2509] delivered? But you could go to Kmart or Target or anywhere else and buy it for 20 bucks.
[time=2516] The deceit of words. Men, women are in business. Isn't it hard to be honest?
[time=2531] I don't expect you to say this car kind of cheap and crummy. But you don't have to call
[time=2539] everyone a cream puff. You don't have to say that this policy is the best it will be
[time=2545] ever. If it's really not words. The power to deceive. But deception goes beyond that.
[time=2556] It goes beyond the heart to the mouth to the entire personality becomes involved.
[time=2561] Look at the next verse. Verse 13, who corruptly speaks with the mouth, who winks with the eye,
[time=2567] who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers. Here's the guy who he would never say,
[time=2579] I'm running a scam, but he's in partnership. And they've learned to cue each other so that
[time=2585] each of them can drop the right information at just the right time to create the atmosphere,
[time=2591] that this is really too good to be true. And so one motions the other one and they pick up the slack.
[time=2598] Back and forth, they play the contest. This one is now the skilled deceiver. He not only knows
[time=2608] how to say the right words, but his body language is perfect. His act is convincing. He's got it down.
[time=2616] Little boy was 14 years old. Looked like he was 10 and he learned how to play a game. He'd go into a department store. And his mom was over there. He'd go over there and he'd cry and say, I want my mommy. And he'd cry. I want my mom. People come by to give him candy.
[time=2628] One guy'd come by and give him money. Somebody else had to offer to help and he'd shy away, and somebody else gave him money. The clerk came home and said, little boy, I saw your mom, she's right over there. He said, shh. Don't tell anybody. He had it down. You knew how to play the role.
[time=2645] You know how to live a lie. You know, this auditorium is full of all of us who know how to live a lie.
[time=2653] We know how to live a lie spiritually. There are many here today that today you name the name of
[time=2661] Jesus. Tomorrow you wouldn't think of mentioning his name except for to punctuate your profanity.
[time=2668] There are some of you who said, yes, I've received Christ because you knew that's what your spouse
[time=2674] wanted to hear, but you've never given your heart to Christ and you're living a lie.
[time=2678] But you've got it down. Your act is smooth. No one will know. But you and God.
[time=2687] Then it moves beyond the lips and beyond the person to actually the associates.
[time=2695] Here's a man whose friendships are built upon a character flaw. You know, the thieves do love
[time=2702] each other's company, but they don't trust each other. There's no honor amongst them either.
[time=2707] But you see, this guy's developed a camaraderie because you don't wink to yourself. You don't signal with your feet to yourself. He's got associates. He's got partners. He's got a lifestyle of it.
[time=2719] Former president of Otterbein College tells this story. Blind man was begging outside of a building.
[time=2729] He would shake his cup and shake his cup. The man went by and he dropped a 50 cent piece into that cup.
[time=2734] Went by, looked back and he saw the blind man, lift his glasses, check out the size of the coin.
[time=2741] Came back and said, well, you're not blind. I saw you checking out the size of that coin.
[time=2746] The man said, no, you're right. I'm not blind. I'm the alternate blind guy. My friend's blind and he
[time=2752] couldn't be here today, so I'm collecting money for him. Where's your friend? He's at the movies.
[time=2760] Isn't it amazing how we develop friends of the same character as we are.
[time=2766] You see, your character will determine your associates, but there's a final step here.
[time=2774] Heart, mouth, personality, associates, there's a final step, and that is this lifestyle.
[time=2781] You see, in psychological words, there is a person that is called a pathological liar.
[time=2789] A pathological liar is someone who lies. They don't even know they're lying.
[time=2793] They cannot conceive of the fact they're lying. They just lie. They do it constantly, and they
[time=2799] believe they're lies with great sincerity. But don't push that off as the extreme. You see,
[time=2807] once we learn to lie, it becomes an instinct, and we learn to say phrases without thinking.
[time=2814] Phrase is like, oh, I'm sorry, but the check is in the mail. Click. Where's the checkbook, honey?
[time=2822] I've got to get that check in the mail today. It becomes a lifestyle. It becomes an instinct
[time=2830] to say, I will lie. We usually lie to do one of two things, to cover up our mistakes so we won't
[time=2836] be found out, or to exaggerate our accomplishments so we'll be received. Either way, we're trying to
[time=2845] enhance our reputation by covering up shortcomings, our maximizing accomplishments, and whenever we
[time=2852] do that, the character that we're trying to protect is Mard the greater. That's the development of a
[time=2862] deceiver. But next Solomon warns his son of the dangers of deception. Look at verse 14,
[time=2869] Hugh plots evil with deceit in his heart. He always stirs up dissension. Therefore, the zaster will
[time=2878] overtake him in an instant. He will suddenly be destroyed without remedy. Keep that in mind. I'll
[time=2886] turn back as I asked you to before, to chapter 26. You'll see the same pattern. Verse 26,
[time=2894] "His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
[time=2905] If a man digs a pit, he will fall into it. If a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on him.
[time=2914] A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruined." Solomon is now saying to
[time=2921] his son, "Don't allow it to develop, and here are the dangers of deception." There are at least
[time=2927] these two. Danger number one is inherent in deception, is dissension. Deception breeds
[time=2938] dissension. You see, once we deceive, we not only ruin our own character, but we breed mistrust
[time=2947] in everyone else. It says, "Whoever flatters with their mouth works ruined. Whoever deceives
[time=2954] hates the one they deceive." There's nothing more tragic than to live with someone whom you cannot
[time=2965] trust, because integrity is gone. Aristotle was asked, "What will befall the deceiver?"
[time=2973] And Aristotle said, "The greatest thing that will befall him is no one will believe him, when he eventually speaks the truth." You learn that story as a little child. You remember a little
[time=2985] boy he was put in charge of the sheep at night, and if a wolf was to come, he was to call out, "Wolf, wolf!" And the men would come running, but he deceived them. He called out wolf, wolf,
[time=2996] when there was no wolf, and the men came running, and there was no wolf. They went home. The next
[time=3003] night the little boy saw no wolf, but he called wolf, wolf. They came running. There was no wolf,
[time=3009] and they went home. The third night the little boy sees a wolf, and the wolf comes at him in the sheep, and he cries out, "Wolf, wolf!" And no one believed him, because integrity was already
[time=3022] lost. The ascension had broken the plan of protection. Marriages, businesses, city governments,
[time=3032] nations, collapse, more often from the attack of character within than the attack of physical might
[time=3043] without. We had a slight problem with integrity with one of our children, so I went through the
[time=3051] story, wolf, wolf. At the end of that story I said, "Now, honey, what do you think that story means?"
[time=3057] I dar looked at me and said, "Dad, that means you better come no matter what."
[time=3063] Missed the whole point of the story.
[time=3070] You know what's amazing? Many of us go through these passages of Scripture.
[time=3076] We read what it says about the dangers and the dissensions that go with deceit. At the end of it
[time=3084] all someone says, "What does that mean?" It says, "I better be a little more crafty, or I make it
[time=3091] God." We miss the whole point. The first danger of deception is it breeds dissension.
[time=3101] Proverbs 6, verse 14. Second danger is discovery, discovery. You see, whenever you tell a lie,
[time=3115] your greatest fear is when will I be found out? When will they know? This passage is saying
[time=3125] that whenever we lie, we gig a pit. And you know who's going to fall into that pit? We are.
[time=3134] It's like taking a stone and pushing it up the hill. Do you know what's going to roll back on?
[time=3140] You, the one pushing it. And as we go through life trying to push our lives ahead of us,
[time=3146] there comes a time when their power is greater and they roll back over us. We're caught on our own
[time=3153] deception. We're caught in a lie. Four high school seniors were smitten with a severe case of spring
[time=3165] fever. They skipped classes all morning long and showed up at 11 o'clock just as the biology
[time=3172] teacher had ended that day's exam. The four of them came together apologizing for missing the test
[time=3180] and explained they had a flat tire. The teacher said, "I'm sorry you missed the test, but it'll be all right. I can give you a one question test. If you pass it, you pass the biology test." He said, "I want each of you to go into four different corners of the room. I want you to take out a piece of paper. This is a 30 second test. Right now each of you draw a picture of a car and make
[time=3200] sure you have four tires on your car. Now here's your test. Circle the flat tire." Teacher said, "If all four pictures circled the same tire, you passed. If one of them's wrong,
[time=3217] you'll fail." A test of integrity. The danger being found out. There are a number of scriptures
[time=3226] that tell us about being found out. Chapter 6, verse 15, "Therefore disaster will overtake him
[time=3234] in an instant, and he suddenly will be destroyed without remedy." Chapter 10, verse 9.
[time=3243] "The man of integrity walks securely, but he who takes crooked paths will be found out."
[time=3253] Chapter 12, verse 19. "Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue only lasts
[time=3269] for a moment. The danger of deception is a life, of dissension, and a life of being found out."
[time=3279] Finally, he gives us here a divine warning. For the Hebrew writer, there needed to be a way of
[time=3287] grabbing attention, of saying, "Listen to this, and so they develop the device, and here's the device.
[time=3294] There are six things that the Lord hates. No, seven are an abomination to him."
[time=3301] That got the year. Six. Hate. No, one more. Emphasis. Now, out of seven things God hates,
[time=3310] note that two of them deal with integrity. One is the second one, a lying tongue. A second one is
[time=3317] found later, the sixth description. A false witness who pours out lies. In this divine warning,
[time=3327] there are three things you need to know. One, God hates deceit. He hates it.
[time=3332] Two, God will ultimately balance the scale. The stone that you push uphill will fall back on you.
[time=3342] God may perhaps do that through natural consequences, perhaps through his own intervention.
[time=3348] Chapter 16, verse 11 says this, "Honest scales and balances are from the Lord,
[time=3355] and all the weights in the bag are of his making." What's that saying? It's saying this,
[time=3362] "When you cheat somebody in the business deal, you've taken your bag, and your bag says that this
[time=3368] is one pound, and it's really only 12 ounces, and you put it on your side of the scale so that when
[time=3374] the commodity you're selling balances out, they think they're getting a pound, but they're only getting 12 ounces." You know what this saying? God's sovereign. He owns the scales, and he will
[time=3385] repay in time. God will balance the scales. Whether he does it through natural consequences,
[time=3396] or his own intervention, he will balance the scales. Proverbs 19, verse 5 gives us this principle.
[time=3403] A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who pours out lies will not go free. God balances
[time=3412] the scales. Finally, this, God will reward integrity. God will reward integrity. Chapter 10, verse 9,
[time=3424] we just man it. Just read it. "The man who walks in integrity walks with security."
[time=3431] Economic panic had swept across the nation. Literally, the states of the individual colonies
[time=3441] of America are states were going bankrupt. Their debts were so high that individual states could
[time=3447] not pay them off. That consistently went through history. We come to the middle of the 1800s,
[time=3453] and one state, Pennsylvania, finds a cure. The state legislature of Pennsylvania makes a decree. The governor signs it. They repudiate all their debts. They simply say we no longer in debt, and we will not pay any of our creditors. They pass the prom on the individuals.
[time=3469] And state after state began to follow the example of Pennsylvania in denouncing their debts.
[time=3475] The Illinois legislature was meeting. They were considering repudiating their debts.
[time=3482] The bait had swept across the floor in favor of such a move. A senior statesman, Steven Douglas,
[time=3489] was too ill to walk in, but he was carried in on a stretcher. And Steven Douglas couldn't stand,
[time=3497] but he could speak. And he made one motion. And he said, "Gentlemen, let Illinois be honest."
[time=3503] And it ended. And they paid their debts. And they were the first to recover economically.
[time=3512] I hope that you received inspiration today as you listened to the music presented by
[time=3529] Kathy Hawks and Brian Loosen. Then the message from the Word of God from our Pastor Rick Hawks.
