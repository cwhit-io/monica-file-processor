[time=112] After one of us concerts, a great violinist Fritz Kessler was greeted by some of those who appreciated his ability.
[time=120] One lady came up to him and said, "I would give my life to be able to play the violin like you do." The violinist said, "Madam, I did." (bells ringing)
[time=135] [MUSIC]
[time=142] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=145] Thank you for joining us.
[time=147] Rick's message today is entitled "Managing Our Children Part II." Discipline is the universal essential ingredient for life.
[time=155] It is a lifetime assignment.
[time=157] The athlete, as well as the musician, must practice the art of diligent discipline.
[time=162] The senior adult living on a fixed income must discipline his finances.
[time=166] Enormous fortunes can be squandered in a brief period for the lack of discipline.
[time=171] One of the greatest gifts we can give to our children is a discipline childhood as a preparation for life.
[time=177] In life discipline is more easily learned early in life than late.
[time=181] Proverbs teaches us to discipline our children.
[time=185] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=189] The sanctuary choir will be bringing us a song entitled "The Lord is My Light." Our special music guest today is Christian recording artist Jim Murray.
[time=199] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=208] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=212] Now, here's Rick.
[time=215] And to welcome our friends who join us now by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=220] As our choir leads us in worship today, they sing from Psalm 27.
[time=224] The Lord is My Light and My Salvation.
[time=228] [MUSIC]
[time=233] The Lord is My Light, the Lord is My Light, the light of My Light, the light of My Light, and My Self in it.
[time=241] Anyways, I'll say, My light and my self in it.
[time=245] So the Lord is my strength, the strength of My Light.
[time=252] My life is my strength and my self in it.
[time=257] [MUSIC]
[time=262] The Lord is My Light, the Lord is My Light, the light of My Light, the light of My Light, the light of My Fire.
[time=274] The Lord is My Light, the Lord is My Light,
[time=280] the light of My Light, the light of My Light, the light of My Light, the light of My Light, and My Self in it.
[time=290] [MUSIC]
[time=295] The Lord is My Strength, the Lord is My Strength, the strength of My Light, the light of My Self in it.
[time=303] [MUSIC]
[time=308] The Lord is My Self in it.
[time=312] [MUSIC - 95 seconds]
[time=410] (audience applauding) - The Lord is my rock and my salvation of whom shall I fear.
[time=420] Praise the wonderful name of our Lord.
[time=422] Amazing love.
[time=424] How can it be that Jesus died for me?
[time=426] Him number 186.
[time=428] And can it be 186?
[time=430] We'll sing the first, third and fifth stanzas together.
[time=435] (gentle music)
[time=450] [MUSIC - 207 seconds]
[time=667] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=669] I'm sure the Lord is pleased when we offer praises to His name like that.
[time=673] I mentioned in the first hour that we've been waiting for quite some time for Jim Murray to come and minister to us.
[time=680] Jim is formerly a member of the Imperial's Quartet.
[time=683] When I met him this morning, we just had a great time of fellowship. It was very brief.
[time=688] But I know that he's got a great heart for the Lord.
[time=691] That's a great ministry in song, and he's going to be with us the entire day in our morning worship service.
[time=696] And then you reserve this evening at 6 p.m.
[time=699] Come early and get a good seat and enjoy marvelous inspiration through music as Jim comes back.
[time=705] Now I'd like to have you give him a Blackhawk welcome as Jim Murray comes to sing for us.
[time=710] Let's welcome him, please.
[time=711] (Applause) (Music)
[time=729] Worthy are you to receive all the praise flowing out of the hearts of the people you made, O Lord.
[time=738] Worthy are you.
[time=743] (Music) Faithful are you to supply every need of the people you love when we trust and believe for Lord.
[time=756] Faithful are you.
[time=760] Worthy and painful and righteous are you.
[time=764] Wonderful counselor mighty God, let every melody out of my mouth sing praise.
[time=775] Worthy and painful and righteous are you.
[time=778] Wonderful counselor mighty God, let every melody out of my mouth sing praise for all of my days.
[time=793] (Music) Righteous are you in the council of men.
[time=799] When we humble our hearts you restore us again.
[time=803] O Lord, righteous are you.
[time=810] Worthy and painful and righteous are you.
[time=814] Wonderful counselor mighty God, let every melody out of my mouth sing praise.
[time=822] Worthy and painful and righteous are you.
[time=828] Wonderful counselor mighty God, let every melody out of my mouth sing praise.
[time=839] Worthy and painful and righteous are you.
[time=842] Wonderful counselor mighty God, let every melody out of my mouth sing praise.
[time=853] Worthy and painful and righteous are you.
[time=860] Wonderful counselor mighty God.
[time=873] It's a privilege for us today to be able to share our morning worship services with you friends who join us by way of television.
[time=881] You've already seen our special guest Jim Murray and I'm excited that he would spend a Sunday morning with us.
[time=887] Rick we've been announcing he's coming for several weeks and I too am excited that he's here.
[time=892] He's had a great background in quartets going way back in the early days of quartets traveling the circuit so to speak
[time=899] and moved up to the Imperials and has been at the tenor there for a number of years and is an outstanding singer.
[time=906] He's decided to leave that quartet and go on the ministry of his own and he is an exciting singer.
[time=911] We're glad that he's here to be a part of Blackhawk and the Bible hour today and we're glad that we can share him with you.
[time=918] When we think of music here there's nothing bigger and more exciting than the living Christmas tree and I have to tell you Pete last Sunday I got hit up a couple times why people say do you have any tree tickets yet?
[time=930] We've gotten a lot of letters already and that's exciting and we're glad for those letters but we'll remind you that tickets are not available until November.
[time=937] However, Rick the Founders Club will be receiving a letter soon concerning their way of receiving tickets.
[time=943] Well, we're looking forward to the tree and we will be sure and let you know right here on the Bible or when the living Christmas tree tickets do become available but they haven't even been printed yet so we can't give them to you either.
[time=955] But we do have something we can give to you today.
[time=958] It's an excellent little book called Experiencing God's Forgiveness.
[time=963] In fact, one of the concepts that I'm going to share with you in today's message is something that I borrowed right out of this booklet by Luis Palau.
[time=971] And if you would like a copy of Experiencing God's Forgiveness we would like to send it to you as a Bible study and a help tool in your life.
[time=980] As I serve as a pastor and as a pastor, serve as a counselor I meet people weekly whose greatest need is to know that they are forgiven
[time=991] and to learn how to forgive others. If you would like a copy of this booklet we would like to send it to you as a gift from us to you
[time=999] so simply write to us today and ask for your copy of Experiencing God's Forgiveness.
[time=1005] You can receive this excellent booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1012] and the zip code is 46815. Once again that's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1021] 46815. Thank you Pete and I do hope you'll write for this booklet. If I could just give you one illustration perhaps it will motivate you to write and request it.
[time=1033] Three weeks ago when a counseling session a couple were very upset with each other and one would say "Well the reason I said what I did is because you did that first."
[time=1042] And she would respond saying "Well the only reason that happened is because what you did the week before." And they were tracing back all through the years of their life their disappointments and their frustrations.
[time=1053] And they wanted to find out who's right and who's wrong. And out of God's word we looked at a simple concept to forgive one another just as Christ
[time=1062] for gave you. He forgave us unconditionally and undeservedly. And when they realized that they too could forgive one another unconditionally
[time=1071] it turned their entire life around. In fact both of them gave their lives to Christ and today their marriage and their life is built upon a solid rock.
[time=1080] How's your forgiveness? Write for this booklet and we'll be glad to send you a copy.
[time=1086] And when you get this in the mail we would like to thank you for paying attention to the many things we send to you in the mail also.
[time=1094] Many of you have probably received in the last week a letter from us telling you about our television ministry and our new sanctuary and all of the equipment that's necessary to make the Bible all possible.
[time=1106] We're looking forward to our new sanctuary across the street. People here at Blackhawk have given sacrificially and generously to make a new home for the church and for the Bible hour.
[time=1117] We'll have a production studio there. We'll also have a new control room and a large facility for producing the Bible hour.
[time=1125] But one of the things we still need is new equipment. And if you received a letter from us I would ask you to give that prayerful consideration.
[time=1133] If you've not received a letter from us but would like to know how you can help also write to us and we'll be glad to include you in the dispensing of that information.
[time=1142] Pete, would you give him the address one more time?
[time=1145] Yes, when writing right to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Lane, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1154] Well, thank you again for being a part of the Bible hour today. As we do go back to our worship service, we have the privilege of hearing from Jim Murray again.
[time=1163] I'm looking forward to that. I'm sure that you are as well. And then please have your heart and your Bible's open and ready to study a new principle from God's Word, a lifetime assignment on discipline.
[time=1184] Look with me. Walk with me. Lest my eyes no longer see. All the glory. All the story of your love.
[time=1207] Talk to me. Talk to me. Like you spoke. So tenderly when you walked there. When you talked there by the sea.
[time=1229] Let me follow in the footprints. That's right. The shores of Galilee.
[time=1250] And let me learn to pray. Like he prayed.
[time=1262] In the garden, love gets heavenly. Take my hand. Take my hand. Teach me, Lord, to understand all the beauty, all the duty of your love.
[time=1291] Let me follow in the footprints. That's right. The shores of Galilee.
[time=1315] And let me learn to pray. Like he prayed.
[time=1327] In the garden, love gets heavenly. Take my hand. Or take my hand. Teach me, Lord, to understand all the beauty, all the duty of your love.
[time=1356] Love, love.
[time=1381] To join to be here in Fort Wayne Indiana at Black Hawk Baptist Church and to be a part of your morning worship service.
[time=1388] And I'm looking forward to giving concert tonight. We'll be a little looser in the concert presentation.
[time=1395] I did bring my cowbell, the infamous cowbell that I do travel all across the country with.
[time=1400] And I will be playing a number on the cowbell tonight so I hope that you'll come out.
[time=1404] But I also wore one of the heaviest suits that I own because I thought it was going to be cold up here.
[time=1410] And I should know better because I'm from Lansing, just up the road the way is here from you.
[time=1415] But I do live in Nashville now so I didn't know what to wear. But I will have a lighter suit on this evening because we're getting a little warm up here right now.
[time=1427] But anyway, I'm thankful for the opportunity to be here and to share what the Lord's been doing in my life.
[time=1434] You know, a lot of times we get so busy, so wrapped up in details and so wrapped up in our little jobs that we all perform when we come to church
[time=1442] and just leading our lives as Christians that a lot of times we leave out some real important things that we need to be doing.
[time=1448] And that's our daily walk with the Lord. It's so easy to just walk by His Word and not pick it up and sit down and just begin to read
[time=1456] and let Him speak to us are so easy not to take time and just pray and communicate with the Father.
[time=1462] This song that I want to share and leave with you now talks about that. It simply says, "Lord, I need to feel your touch again."
[time=1487] When I woke this morning to start another day, I didn't even feel the need to pray.
[time=1503] I started past the table where your word neglected lay. I picked it up and blew the dust away.
[time=1520] Lord, I need to feel your touch again. And I need to be assured you're still my friend.
[time=1536] I need to know the power in your blood that cleanses sin. Lord, I need to feel your touch again.
[time=1556] My days have been so busy, too many things to do. I couldn't seem to find the time to talk to you.
[time=1572] My heart is cold and calloused, and my fellowship is few. But I know how much I need you, Lord. I really need to feel your touch again.
[time=1596] And I need to be assured you're still my friend. I need to know the power in your blood that cleanses sin.
[time=1612] And Lord, I need to feel your touch again. Take me back into your arms and teach me to be strong.
[time=1628] Fill me with yourself so I won't stay away so long.
[time=1639] Lord, I need to feel your touch again. And I need to be assured you're still my friend.
[time=1657] I need to know the power in your blood that cleanses sin. And Lord, I need to feel your touch again.
[time=1676] And I need to be assured you're still my friend. I need to know the power in your blood that cleanses sin.
[time=1693] Lord, I need to feel your touch. Let me feel your gentle touch. Lord, I need to feel your touch again.
[time=1721] Thank you, Jim. Let us pray together. God's Jim's song has said it so eloquently. We do need to feel your touch again.
[time=1733] Father, many are here today huddled out of discouragement, doubt, even some depression.
[time=1742] God, there needs to be a refreshment of their soul. It would give power to life. There are those who need to feel your touch again.
[time=1753] God, there are others today who they have chosen wrong paths and they know that and they need to feel your corrective touch again.
[time=1764] God, we invite you today to correct us and to touch us with the rod of your discipline if we need that.
[time=1773] God, there are others of us who need to feel your touch today because we have grown cold to life.
[time=1781] Perhaps to our job, perhaps to our family, perhaps to our singleness.
[time=1790] God, we need to be given a spark for life. We need to feel your touch again.
[time=1797] God, others of us need to feel your touch because we need physical help.
[time=1803] We pray for Jim Murray's wife as she battles with a chronic problem with her gallbladder and a pinched nerve.
[time=1812] We pray for Marv Eastlin as he battles pancreatitis and Marv Daggetz as he would battle an unnamed enemy.
[time=1819] Our Dean Marker, she recovers from surgery. God, each needs to feel your touch.
[time=1826] God, we would pray for Jim Pearson as it appears that his father's death is very near, that they would feel your touch.
[time=1835] The promise of your word in a eternal life. God, we need to feel your touch even as we come to this place and worship you.
[time=1845] Some of us have no idea why we are here. We've come out of tradition or because someone else invited us.
[time=1853] Some of us have come because we always come.
[time=1857] But God, make this alive in our hearts. God, we've come to praise you.
[time=1863] Thank you for a song today that would speak of the richness of our blessing in Christ.
[time=1869] And we stand amazed when we hear and can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's name.
[time=1877] We've come today to praise you, O Lord Jesus our Savior. We want to glorify and magnify and ascribe all worship to you.
[time=1886] For it's in your name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1893] There was a great violinist by the name of Fritz Kessler.
[time=1898] He had toured the nation. He had given concerts that were just magnificent.
[time=1904] After one of the concerts, a lady came up to him approving and applauding of his great skill.
[time=1911] And then she said, "I would give my life to be able to play like you do. I would give my life."
[time=1921] And the violinist said, "Madam, I did." He had given his life to playing that stringed instrument.
[time=1930] What have you given your life to? There was a time in my life where I gave my life to swimming.
[time=1936] I got up in the morning and I went to swim practice. I endured school to be eligible.
[time=1941] After school, I went back to swim practice. After swim practice, I lifted weights.
[time=1946] I gave my life to that for three years.
[time=1950] What have you given your life to?
[time=1953] Well, there are things in life that we give ourselves to because they're short-term assignments.
[time=1958] Do you remember some of the assignments that you had in life that were short-term?
[time=1962] I remember chemistry in high school. I'm so thankful that was a one-year assignment in life.
[time=1968] I'm not only thankful, so was my chemistry teacher thankful that it was a one-year assignment.
[time=1975] Can I confess to you that as a father of newborns, I'm thankful that is a short-term assignment.
[time=1982] I like them when they get about two or three, but those little ones, I'm not sure what you do.
[time=1988] Something's going to move out of one end or the other, and you can't reason with them, and you try to make... I'm glad that was a short-term assignment.
[time=1998] But you know, God gives us some lifetime assignments. Did you know that?
[time=2004] God gives us some assignments that they aren't for this year. They aren't for this stage.
[time=2009] They're not for swimming through high school. They are lifetime assignments.
[time=2014] We've talked about many of those lifetime assignments, assignment-like integrity.
[time=2021] It is a jewel that is never out of fashion in the wardrobe of God.
[time=2027] It is a lifetime assignment.
[time=2030] Today, we want to talk about another lifetime assignment.
[time=2035] It is the assignment of discipline.
[time=2038] Last week, we began a series called "Managing Our Children." It could just as well be titled "Managing Ourselves." We talked last week that whatever we want our children to be, we've got to model that for them.
[time=2051] We want them to be soft-spoken. They better not grow up in my house.
[time=2055] I'm just not soft-spoken.
[time=2058] We want them to have a commitment to Christ. It better be in our life.
[time=2062] They'll model after us.
[time=2065] Secondly, we talked about the fact that we must teach them verbally.
[time=2069] "My son, give me your ear. Children, don't let your eyes depart from my path."
[time=2075] We're to teach, but thirdly, that's today's lesson.
[time=2079] We are to discipline our children, but don't let it just be for children today.
[time=2083] We need to discipline ourselves.
[time=2085] Do you have a Bible? I hope you do.
[time=2087] I thought that was so appropriate. The way Jim used that illustration.
[time=2090] Did you hear him as he sang and he sang about a Bible that had been laid aside and then he would pick it up and draw it?
[time=2097] This week, would you pick up God's Word and would you draw it into your life?
[time=2102] Make that your habit.
[time=2103] And then bring it with you as you come back next Sunday.
[time=2106] But we're studying through Proverbs. Next Sunday is our last study in Proverbs.
[time=2110] If you're new to the study, Proverbs is found in the Old Testament.
[time=2114] The book of Psalms is just about in the middle and Proverbs follows Psalms.
[time=2120] Proverbs is not a one thesis treatise on life.
[time=2125] It's not a thesis that is developed over 31 chapters.
[time=2129] It is actually a collection of short insights, randomly placed for our sampling.
[time=2135] It's a lot like God took a salt shaker and he put all the things he wanted us to know
[time=2141] and then he sprinkled them out. Now we can pick them up just as little nuggets as we taste of his Word.
[time=2147] Well, let's start in Proverbs 22 today. Can you find Proverbs?
[time=2151] If you need a little help, there's a table of contents in the front of your Bible.
[time=2155] Proverbs chapter 22 verses 15 and then we'll go to chapter 23 in a moment.
[time=2163] Let me just randomly read some verses for you.
[time=2167] Chapter 22 verse 15, folly, foolishness, you might even say a sinful temperament,
[time=2176] folly is bound up in the heart of a child.
[time=2182] But the rod of discipline will drive it far from him.
[time=2188] Now chapter 23 verses 13 and 14, do not withhold discipline from a child.
[time=2198] If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.
[time=2203] Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death.
[time=2209] And then finally for now, chapter 29 verse 15.
[time=2217] The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself, disgracees his mother.
[time=2229] This morning I would like to share seven concepts about discipline with you out of God's Word.
[time=2237] Concepts that I want to make a lifetime assignment for me and for my children.
[time=2243] Principle number one is this, discipline is essential and critical in the development of life.
[time=2252] Discipline, it's essential and it's critical to the development of life.
[time=2259] Now you don't have to move through these.
[time=2261] Just let me re-address some of the things that you've just heard.
[time=2265] Folly is bound up in a child.
[time=2268] It's inside every one of us.
[time=2271] We have a disposition that we inherited all the way back from Adam.
[time=2277] Sin entered into the human race and in his past down as clear as biology, we've inherited that.
[time=2285] Plato would reason, does man do good things because he is good?
[time=2291] And does man do bad things because he is bad?
[time=2297] Or is a man good and therefore he does good things?
[time=2302] Or is a man bad because he does bad things?
[time=2305] Which came first, the innate spirit that had a propensity for good or evil?
[time=2310] Or did he do good or evil and that corrupted him?
[time=2313] This passage says it's born in us.
[time=2317] We've inherited a sinful nature.
[time=2319] Folly is bound up in a child.
[time=2324] But the rod of discipline will change that.
[time=2328] In the study of human behavior, as we look at how human behavior is developed, there are at least these three models.
[time=2335] The first is the hereditary model, which says that we inherit within our chromal structures.
[time=2342] Those chromosomes that give us curly hair and blue eyes, that give us a certain frame size,
[time=2348] also give us certain temperaments.
[time=2351] We may be prone to be angry or we may be prone to be passive based upon genetics and heredity.
[time=2358] When man put it this way, it's a mystery of biology.
[time=2363] How the idiot that married your daughter can be the father of the smartest grandchildren in the world.
[time=2371] That's following that heredity as a model.
[time=2375] Do they inherit that or do they develop it later?
[time=2379] I believe that there is an element of truth to heredity, not only in physical shape, but in innate intelligence and in emotional disposition.
[time=2388] Some children are born with a strong will.
[time=2392] Others are born as passive as they could be.
[time=2396] One of our three children is an achiever.
[time=2400] The teacher says you're supposed to go home and read three books.
[time=2403] She'll read four.
[time=2404] You don't have to say read the book.
[time=2406] Another one of our children could give a rip.
[time=2411] Could care less.
[time=2414] Same parents.
[time=2416] Same biology.
[time=2418] Yet there's still an element of truth to that.
[time=2420] There's a second model that says no, it's not so much heredity.
[time=2424] It's the unconscious experiences of life.
[time=2428] You go all the way back to 1225.
[time=2430] A birth of a man by the name of Thomas of Aquinas.
[time=2433] Saint Thomas Aquinas developed a philosophy and he said no.
[time=2439] Mankind is born with a tabula rasa, a blank slate.
[time=2444] He is not born good.
[time=2446] He is not born evil.
[time=2447] He is born as a blank slate.
[time=2449] And the experiences of life unconsciously are written there.
[time=2453] Freud picked up on that with the inner personality that is unconscious, that begins to shape behavior.
[time=2461] Unaware of conscious experiences, unconsciously values are developed.
[time=2466] Could that be true?
[time=2467] There is a sense in which that is true.
[time=2470] There are formidable experiences that shape our life that we may never even remember.
[time=2476] But there is a third model that holds the majority of the insight.
[time=2481] And that is the model of conscious choices.
[time=2486] Human conscious choices.
[time=2489] Yes, you inherited biology from your parents and with that may have come certain temperamental dispositions or lack of.
[time=2497] You by your experiences in life were written upon and you may not have been conscious of those.
[time=2504] But largely human behavior is the product of choice.
[time=2509] We make choices.
[time=2511] And those choices often come from this sinful nature.
[time=2515] But those choices can be molded.
[time=2518] They can be shaped.
[time=2519] They can be channeled by discipline.
[time=2523] Now in these verses that not only tells us that discipline is essential, it gives us a subtle little insight.
[time=2530] Insight number two, this one.
[time=2533] Discipline comes easier, earlier, harder later.
[time=2540] Now where did I pull that trick from?
[time=2543] Chapter 23, we read this just a moment ago.
[time=2547] It says, "Do not withhold discipline from a child if you punish him with the rod.
[time=2552] He will not die.
[time=2554] Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death." You see, because of our sinful disposition, we are moving through life in a given direction.
[time=2566] And if discipline does not divert us, we are ultimately headed to a lifestyle of destruction.
[time=2573] It starts off bad and it gets worse.
[time=2578] Now some of us, we retreat from that concept of a sinful disposition.
[time=2584] We like to look at these little children.
[time=2586] They're just so cute.
[time=2587] Oh, they wouldn't do anything wrong.
[time=2589] They're just so precious.
[time=2591] Little boy is about three years old.
[time=2593] Cute little guy.
[time=2595] He was outside in the cold and he'd blow on his hands trying to keep warm.
[time=2599] And then he'd strain to reach the doorbell and he couldn't reach the doorbell.
[time=2602] And he would jump and miss and try to warm his hands and jump.
[time=2606] He couldn't quite get that doorbell and he was so cold.
[time=2610] Minister walked by and saw him struggling.
[time=2613] Walked up and put his arm around the little boy and said, "Now there, that's all right.
[time=2617] Let me help you." And he reached up and the minister rang the doorbell and he said, "Now, how's that?" Little three-year-old said, "Now we run before the old bat comes to the door." Oh, cute little innocent guy.
[time=2632] That wasn't my son.
[time=2633] I was the minister.
[time=2634] That was your son.
[time=2637] Mine's cute.
[time=2638] He doesn't have a sinful nature.
[time=2640] Isn't that the way we often feel about you?
[time=2642] Oh, they're just so cute.
[time=2643] They'd never do anything wrong.
[time=2645] Yeah, they will.
[time=2647] They do.
[time=2648] It's born in them.
[time=2650] Now we run before the old bat comes.
[time=2653] Boy, they learn that early in life.
[time=2656] It comes from within them.
[time=2658] And discipline will keep them from ultimately heading down that path of destruction.
[time=2663] We read chapter 29, verse 15, just a minute ago.
[time=2667] Let me read it for you again.
[time=2668] The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself, it gets worse.
[time=2676] He disgraces his mother.
[time=2681] The discipline will intervene and it will give direction.
[time=2687] And it comes easier, earlier, harder, later.
[time=2693] Chapter 19 reinforces that.
[time=2696] I've read these two you often.
[time=2698] Allow me to bring it back for your remembering.
[time=2701] Chapter 19, verse 18, it says, "Discipline your son for in that there is hope.
[time=2708] There is no hope for your son.
[time=2713] Do not be a willing party to his death.
[time=2718] Do not be a willing party to his death." If you fail to discipline your son, you are allowing him to proceed down the path of destruction.
[time=2730] Don't be a willing party to that.
[time=2734] Then it follows, "A hot, tempered man must pay the penalty.
[time=2739] If you rescue him, you will have to do it again." Little child, if you don't discipline him, it will go down the path.
[time=2746] And the need for discipline will always be there.
[time=2749] And if he grows up and he hasn't learned to discipline his anger, he hasn't learned to discipline his tongue.
[time=2756] And you rescue him, guess what?
[time=2759] Consciously or unconsciously, he'll reason.
[time=2762] I don't have to discipline myself.
[time=2764] If things fall apart, they'll bail me out.
[time=2768] It'll always work out.
[time=2770] One of the greatest gifts you could give your children is the opportunity to come face to face with their failures and to rescue themselves.
[time=2782] You have a son who is 30 and he has squandered his resources and he asks for more very rarely is it wise to give it to him.
[time=2791] Very rarely is it wise.
[time=2795] Because if you rescue him, you'll have to do it again and again.
[time=2799] And if you do it earlier, it's easier.
[time=2801] It comes harder later.
[time=2803] Principle number three that I would share with you is this one.
[time=2807] It is your responsibility to discipline your children.
[time=2812] I want to read you three verses from Proverbs.
[time=2814] Some you've heard already today.
[time=2816] But each of these come from God as commands.
[time=2820] These are not suggestions.
[time=2822] These are God's commands.
[time=2824] Chapter 22 verse 6 says, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it."
[time=2832] But it begins with that imperative instruction, "You train up your child."
[time=2838] It's a command.
[time=2840] Chapter 29 verse 17, "Discipline your son, and he will give you peace."
[time=2846] It begins with the command.
[time=2848] Discipline, do it.
[time=2851] Chapter 23 verse 13, "Do not, negative command, do not withhold discipline from your child."
[time=2860] God in a sovereign plan designed human relationships with families.
[time=2869] And he gave to us as parents the responsibility to raise our children.
[time=2876] Yes, he's there to help us.
[time=2878] Yes, he answers prayer.
[time=2879] But largely he gives insight through his word and he says, "Obey my word." Because I've given them to you.
[time=2887] Occasionally we meet parents who want to give God their kids back.
[time=2890] God, I don't like this kid.
[time=2892] I don't like the way he's acting.
[time=2894] So God, I dedicate this child to you.
[time=2896] And their parents would often say, "I don't know where we went wrong." We gave them back to the Lord.
[time=2901] I don't know, if any place in the Bible it says, "If you're not doing well with your kids, just turn them over to the Lord." An old story told about a football team.
[time=2908] They were getting beat bad and they were getting beat physical.
[time=2912] This team had in the first half put three halfbacks out of commission.
[time=2917] At the beginning of the second half, the fans in the stands were yelling, "Give Fred the ball.
[time=2923] Give Fred the ball.
[time=2925] Give Fred the ball." Fred started leading a cheer.
[time=2928] Fred doesn't want the ball.
[time=2932] And there are a lot of us saying, "I'll give them to God.
[time=2937] I'll give them to God." And God says, "I'll give them to you." Not that God doesn't want them back, but he wants that to be our responsibility.
[time=2944] Don't ever say, "I just turn them over to the Lord." God says, "I don't take handoffs.
[time=2950] I'll help.
[time=2951] I'll coach, but I don't take handoffs." It's our responsibility.
[time=2958] That's the third insight we need to take.
[time=2961] It is our responsibility.
[time=2964] Insight number four.
[time=2967] Discipline is a demonstration of your love for your children.
[time=2973] Chapter three, verses 11 and 12, please.
[time=2978] Chapter three, verse 11.
[time=2981] "My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline.
[time=2986] Do not resent his rebuke." Point isn't that how we respond to discipline?
[time=2992] I hate it.
[time=2995] I resent it.
[time=2998] Verse 12.
[time=3000] Because the Lord disciplines those who catch this now, please.
[time=3006] Those that he loves.
[time=3008] As a father, the son, he delights in.
[time=3013] Why should we discipline our children?
[time=3017] Because we love them.
[time=3019] And we want to guide them on the right path.
[time=3023] We love them.
[time=3028] Imagine your child.
[time=3030] I can picture mine.
[time=3032] They're laying on their bed with a fever that is burning them up.
[time=3036] 103 degrees, 104 degrees, 105 degrees.
[time=3041] And the fever is threatening their health.
[time=3045] Maybe their life.
[time=3047] And you hold in your hand medicine that you know will reduce that fever
[time=3053] that will bring them comfort and health and life.
[time=3057] What parent would say, "Oh, I just love them so much.
[time=3060] I can't make them taste this medicine." It tastes so terrible.
[time=3064] It's kind of chalky and it sticks on their tongue.
[time=3066] And they hate the way it tastes, so I'm not going to give it to them.
[time=3069] I love them too much to give them something they don't want.
[time=3074] When you love that child, you put it in their mouth.
[time=3078] And you try to convince them and you try to hide it and peanut butter.
[time=3082] You try to slurp jelly over it, but you get that in their mouth.
[time=3086] And if that doesn't work, God gave two parents.
[time=3089] One to hold, one to insert.
[time=3092] But it's got to go in.
[time=3094] Why?
[time=3096] Because you're mean?
[time=3098] No.
[time=3099] Because you like to see them gag?
[time=3102] No.
[time=3104] Because you love them.
[time=3106] You want their health.
[time=3108] You want their life.
[time=3112] Listen to this proverb.
[time=3114] It's proverb 13, 24.
[time=3118] He who spares the rod hates his son.
[time=3124] He who loves him is careful to discipline him.
[time=3129] You don't know from the perspective of God to withhold discipline.
[time=3133] Says I hate that child.
[time=3137] It's like taking the medicine of life and locking it in the cabinet.
[time=3144] This principle is discipline is a demonstration of your love.
[time=3150] Next principle I'd like to share with you is this one.
[time=3154] Discipline is primarily positive training.
[time=3157] It's not just a rod.
[time=3159] We're going to talk about a rod in a moment.
[time=3161] But discipline is primarily positive training.
[time=3164] It says train up a child, 22-6.
[time=3167] Train up a child in the way you should go.
[time=3170] And when he's old, he will not depart from that.
[time=3174] Training speaks of experience.
[time=3176] It speaks of being shown.
[time=3178] It speaks of somebody actually taking you hand in hand and walking you through those experiences of life.
[time=3187] How do you learn to catch a football if nobody ever throws it to you?
[time=3192] How do you learn to put a golf club in your hand and interlock the fingers if no one ever says son put your fingers like these?
[time=3201] How do you ever learn to play the piano if somebody doesn't say no.
[time=3205] There are eight notes right here.
[time=3209] It's a little rainy, fossil, latito.
[time=3211] And you've got to play them like this.
[time=3213] One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three.
[time=3215] How will they know that?
[time=3216] If somebody doesn't show them that.
[time=3219] And the disciplines of life are primarily being shown, being modeled, being trained,
[time=3225] being led through life.
[time=3228] We speak of school in the old days of studying a discipline.
[time=3232] How did you study that discipline when somebody was in that class and they would say now it goes like this.
[time=3237] Uno, dos, trays, quattuar.
[time=3240] That's how you do it.
[time=3242] That's how you learn Latin.
[time=3245] Somebody teaches you and somebody shows you.
[time=3247] That's the discipline of life.
[time=3249] And we, our parents, to discipline our children by modeling for them integrities of faithfulness, dependability, being on time.
[time=3262] Where do they learn that?
[time=3263] They don't learn that in the chemistry lab.
[time=3265] They learn it from a father to a son and from a mother to a son.
[time=3269] From parent to daughter is training that is modeled through life.
[time=3273] The next principle is this.
[time=3275] Discipline is also corrective action, both in word and in physical discipline.
[time=3287] You probably heard a word.
[time=3289] It came out of chapter 13, 24, chapter 22, verse 15.
[time=3294] Chapter 23, verses 13 and 14.
[time=3296] Chapter 29, verse 15, it's a little word, rod.
[time=3302] It's not a fishing rod.
[time=3304] It could be, but that's not primarily what was in mind here.
[time=3308] Now, please know this.
[time=3310] There are eminent teachers of learned ways who will disagree with this.
[time=3317] I would simply like to remind us that Proverbs is written by the inspiration of God
[time=3323] and it supersedes all human opinion.
[time=3326] And in Proverbs, it tells us if we spare the rod, we will spoil the child.
[time=3333] The Bible not only condones, it commends physical discipline.
[time=3340] I heard for every child that's been the victim of abuse and some have wrongfully used
[time=3346] their role as parents.
[time=3348] That is grievous.
[time=3350] The second only to that is the child who has been raised without physical discipline.
[time=3357] Let me just give you a couple of insights about physical discipline.
[time=3360] First of all, it is appropriate.
[time=3363] The Bible tells us to use the rod and it's almost in a comical way, Solomon says,
[time=3369] "If you use the rod, he will not die." You know, kids have a way of screaming bloody murder.
[time=3376] Even under normal and appropriate discipline, they're going to act like you're killing them.
[time=3382] And it's all right.
[time=3384] A second little observation I'd make about discipline is kids learn early in life
[time=3390] how to play their side of the discipline.
[time=3393] You see, when kids are first learning that paddling is a part of life, once they get paddled, they start to cry.
[time=3402] But pretty soon they learn that a paddling is coming and they start to cry then.
[time=3407] And you know what happens?
[time=3409] We get conned as parents.
[time=3411] Since they're already crying, we think we've already done the job.
[time=3414] One little kid, he's four years old.
[time=3416] He has slick.
[time=3417] He's riding in the backseat of the car.
[time=3419] His mom's driving the car.
[time=3420] He says, "You know, mom, hurts more when you give me three spankons instead of five."
[time=3426] Oh, really?
[time=3427] Yeah, honest, mom.
[time=3429] You know what else, mom? It hurts more when my pants are on than when they're off.
[time=3435] That kid, he'd figured it out, man.
[time=3437] He's trying to set mom up there.
[time=3440] He'll set us up.
[time=3444] This is a philosophy that has been proved true.
[time=3448] Little children are like canoes.
[time=3451] They go forward best when paddled from the rear.
[time=3456] If you can't remember all that Solomon said, remember that concept.
[time=3462] And you be in control.
[time=3466] Don't let them be in control.
[time=3469] The final principle that I would share with you today is this one.
[time=3474] Discipline is a lifetime assignment.
[time=3479] It doesn't end when they leave home and become their own man or their own woman.
[time=3488] It simply shifts to them now.
[time=3492] My father and mother are here and they believed in discipline.
[time=3497] And I didn't say it when I was three.
[time=3500] I doubt that I said it when I was thirteen, but at thirty-four I'm thankful for that discipline.
[time=3506] It's shaped my life more than anything else.
[time=3509] It is kind.
[time=3517] We've been sharing with you today the special musical ministry of our guest Jim Murray and the message from the word of God from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3525] Accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior is the most important event in your life.
[time=3530] If you'd like to receive Him today, would you bow and pray this prayer with me?
[time=3534] Let's bow together.
[time=3536] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3542] And today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3546] I ask you to come in today, Lord, and to forgive me and to cleanse me of all the sins that I've committed.
[time=3552] I ask this at your name. Amen.
[time=3556] If you prayed this prayer with me this morning, would you write us and tell us that you prayed?
[time=3560] And when you write us, we'll send you a booklet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3568] To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Experiencing God's Forgiveness,"
