[time=90] In an article titled "Millionaires Seldom Smile" is a collection of short insights.
[time=108] Rockefeller said, "I've made millions.
[time=112] They've brought me no happiness.
[time=114] I would barter them all the way for my days back in Cleveland, Ohio where I worked for $3
[time=121] a week." Vanderbilt said, "The care of $200 million is too great for my back or for my brains.
[time=131] I can't bear it anymore.
[time=134] I find no pleasure in it." And Andrew Carnegie said, "Millionaires Seldom Smile."
[time=151] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoffs.
[time=157] Thank you for joining us.
[time=158] Rick's message today is entitled "A Better Way" and is taken from Mark 8.
[time=164] Today's Bible study is a final lesson on the book of Proverbs.
[time=168] This practical collection of insight has become one of Rick's favorite books in God's Word and perhaps one of your favorites also.
[time=176] In this farewell to Proverbs, we will be studying a better way.
[time=180] Repeatedly, Solomon tells us that there is a way better than the conventional thinking with which we approach happiness, prosperity and life itself.
[time=190] Please locate your Bible so that you are able to study with us.
[time=193] Rick's text is Mark 8, verses 34 through 38.
[time=199] Our special music includes a song from the sanctuary choir, a solo from Dennis Kirschner
[time=207] and Lisa McNamara.
[time=211] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=218] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=224] Now here's Rick.
[time=225] Welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour and trust that God uses this hour in each of our lives to magnify the Lord Jesus Christ as we come together to thank Him for
[time=235] the great grace that He's given unto us.
[time=238] Our choir is going to sing a song that it's actually a collection of songs that speak of the grace of our God we today enjoy the grace of our Lord Jesus.
[time=272] Praise God, praise, praise that His praise earth and all that is here.
[time=288] One little grace of Jesus, greater than all my sins, how shall my tongueness rise in,
[time=305] where shall His grace begin, His grace is taking away by burning, setting us here and
[time=316] praying for the land of grace of Jesus, reach us near, wonderful, the matchless grace of
[time=331] Jesus.
[time=332] Praise God, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise,
[time=507] , praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise,
[time=517] [APPLAUSE]
[time=524] Again, we're indeed grateful for our musicians, and every month the orchestra grows a little bit more appreciative of that, fine quality of the people that are willing to give of their time to minister to you all in music.
[time=536] Well, let's join with the choir and orchestra and congregation singing together 666.
[time=542] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas, hymn number 666.
[time=547] [MUSIC - 125 seconds]
[time=696] Thank you very much for your fine singing, continuing music now, Dennis Kirschner's going to come to minister to us.
[time=702] Let's be blessed as he sings for us.
[time=705] [MUSIC]
[time=712] You spoke the words, and all the words came into your belt.
[time=719] You waved your hands and planets filled, sunnaged all scars.
[time=726] You placed a woman in the bed inside the garden, and though they filled, they found compassion
[time=738] in your eyes.
[time=740] O Lord, I spend in awe of the wonder of your deeds, but a greater wonder brings me to my knees.
[time=754] Lord, I praise you because of your love, not because of all the mighty things you've done.
[time=768] Lord, I worship you because of your love.
[time=774] You're the reason that I need to voice my praise because of who you are.
[time=785] [MUSIC]
[time=795] One lonely night you sent your son, born of a virgin, and promised grew as he revealed to us your heart.
[time=803] Enduring love displayed throughout his crucifixion, and in the dark you tore the grave in death
[time=814] upon.
[time=817] O Lord, I stand in awe of the wonder of your deeds, but a greater wonder brings me to my knees.
[time=831] Lord, I praise you because of your love, not because of all the mighty things you've done.
[time=843] Lord, I worship you because of who you are.
[time=852] You're the reason that I need to voice my praise.
[time=860] Lord, I praise you because of your love, not because of all the mighty things you've done.
[time=874] Lord, I worship you because of who you are.
[time=881] You're the reason that I need to voice my praise because of who you are.
[time=894] Because of who you are.
[time=907] [MUSIC]
[time=920] Today it's a joy for us to be able to come into your home, perhaps your hospital room, wherever you're at, and to share the Bible hour with you.
[time=929] We're looking forward to sharing the living Christmas tree with our entire community in just a number of weeks.
[time=935] Rick, it's almost embarrassing to begin talking about Christmas already, but in order to take care of all of the set up and the situations that occur in preparation for the living Christmas tree and to be sure that all the tickets are issued, we need to really start early.
[time=949] If you're planning to come to the living Christmas tree and you'd like to receive tickets, I'm beginning now to advertise the date of November 14th.
[time=958] That's a Saturday that we'll be issuing tickets to the public here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=964] You can receive up to eight tickets per person.
[time=967] So put that on your calendar and mark that date so that you can be here to assure yourself of the date that you want to come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=975] And Pete, let me tell our friends that the reason we're telling you now of the Saturday November the 14th date is not so that you'll start calling, but so that you won't call.
[time=985] We're already getting a number of phone calls for tickets, and we don't even have them printed. They're not here.
[time=991] We will not be taking telephone orders, so please know we want you to come, but in order for us to distribute 20,000 free tickets, we have to have some type of structure.
[time=1000] And you save Saturday the 14th, and you can get tickets on the very first day that we make them available to the general public.
[time=1008] We'll be glad to share those tickets with you at that time.
[time=1011] Today we'd like to share with you some video of our new sanctuary, the new home for the Bible Hour that's being built right across the street so that you can share the joy with us.
[time=1022] The construction is going on right now. One of the big feats that you're seeing right now is the implementing of cranes and many powerful pieces of equipment that are putting the steel together.
[time=1036] They've already got all the foundation work in, and they're tearing out the forms, and that phase of the construction goes over.
[time=1044] We hopefully will build a building that somehow resembles the blueprint. Getting all those details right is important.
[time=1051] Pete, there's a job for you. You could just walk right up there on top of that I-beam and rustle those big steel trusses around 40 feet in the air. You'd love that.
[time=1060] It's very windy that day, and I just admired that fellow walking right across there like he was walking on the ground, and he's probably about 45, 50 feet in the air.
[time=1068] I would assume so, and whatever he gets paid, he's worth it. That view gives you a good idea of what the height and the elevations are like on the new building.
[time=1078] The steel structure that you're seeing here by way of videotape is basically complete. We're inside working on some of the details.
[time=1085] Now, that little gadget looks like fun to drive, too. But this is the outside wall. You can see some of the brick that was there.
[time=1093] The roofing will go on next week, and that won't be long before that. A whole building will start to be coming closed, and you can pray with us that it all is enclosed before the cold season comes.
[time=1105] Although I did notice frost on my windshield this morning. It was 32 degrees this morning when I woke up.
[time=1111] Well, we need to ask your prayers that we get their building in close so that they can work all winter through.
[time=1117] We're excited that God has provided this new facility for us. We're looking forward to it also being a home for the Bible hour.
[time=1124] We've written to many of you a letter telling you about our need for equipment and some planning for the future.
[time=1130] And so if you receive that letter, we would ask you to prayerfully consider it and respond in the way that God leads you.
[time=1136] Also, we would like to ask all of you who watched the Bible hour to take the time to write us a letter and let us know how the ministry is impacting your life.
[time=1146] Your notes, your cards, your letters give us great insight as to the value of the ministry.
[time=1152] What things are speaking to you, what songs are touching your life, how we can improve, and we would love to have you write to us.
[time=1159] Pete, would you give them the address so they can do that?
[time=1162] Yes, we'd encourage you to write. And when you write, you write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1172] Once again, that's the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1180] And when you write, we would be glad to send you a copy of an excellent pamphlet entitled "The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air."
[time=1188] Beginning next week, we're going to study the short New Testament Epistle of Jude, which tells us the importance of having the right doctrine and the right beliefs.
[time=1198] This pamphlet gives you an overview not only of what the scriptures teach, but what a number of what we call cults teach.
[time=1206] The Spirit of Truth, God's Word, the Spirit of Air, what is being taught by the doctrines of men, if you will.
[time=1213] It puts them on the chart and compares them on such important things as the deity of Christ, the person of God, how you can know for sure you're going to heaven.
[time=1222] If you'd like a copy of this, simply ask for the Spirit of Truth, and we'll send you a copy.
[time=1227] Once again, our address is the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1237] That is the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1245] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1247] We go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1249] We trust that God will speak to your heart, go through the message, and release a song.
[time=1257] [MUSIC]
[time=1264] Oh, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[time=1271] When I hear of someone wondering, consider all, all of the words that hands have made.
[time=1286] [MUSIC]
[time=1288] I see the stars, I hear the holy thunder, the power through heart, the universe displayed.
[time=1315] Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee.
[time=1326] How great the heart, how great the heart, then sings my soul, my Savior God.
[time=1344] You're not to me.
[time=1349] How great the heart, how great the heart.
[time=1361] [MUSIC]
[time=1368] And when I think that God, his own son, not sparing, sent him to die,
[time=1385] I scarce can take it in.
[time=1393] That are the cross, my burden gladly buried, he played and died,
[time=1411] to break away my sin.
[time=1420] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=1470] Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee.
[time=1482] How great the heart, how great the heart,
[time=1523] how great the heart, how great the heart, how great the heart,
[time=1552] Thank you, Lisa. And God, we thank you today that there is that confidence in our heart
[time=1569] of who you are. And as we applaud today, God, we're recognizing more than a song that was
[time=1575] written, more than a performance that we've heard. It's our own response. It's our way
[time=1581] of saying yes and affirming what we've heard. God, we've taken delight today that you've been exalted. And we applaud the very words how great thou art we today have come to this
[time=1593] place in one accord with one heart and one mind to give praise to our one God and Savior,
[time=1600] the Lord Jesus Christ. We worship you today, O Lord, and we bring all glory and we cast
[time=1606] it at your feet. And we say with the angels, we're the art thou, O Lord, to receive glory
[time=1614] and wisdom and power and light, for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they
[time=1620] were and are created. God, we recognize today that we are created beings and that we belong
[time=1627] to you, that you own us by right of creation. And we thank you today for the very gift of
[time=1633] life itself. God, we praise you because you are such a God is to be able to create and
[time=1640] to bless us with the joys of life and to comfort us in life's sorrows. God, we do pray
[time=1647] today for your comfort, for Jenny and Cecil Lawson is Jenny's mother is near unto death
[time=1653] and Cecil's mother has passed away a week ago. God, we pray for your comfort for Mary
[time=1660] Heccaman in the tragic loss of her brother. We pray today for Jim Pearson as his father
[time=1667] battles such a fierce enemy. Father, today we come to you, just to praise you what we
[time=1674] must confess with a measure of selfishness because we need you. Thank you for being there
[time=1683] and caring for us. We pray for Linda Wright as she goes through a difficult pregnancy and pray that her delivery might be soon and safe. Father, today we want so much but most of all,
[time=1698] we do want to know you and we ask you to speak to us through your word. In spite of the fact
[time=1704] that I am the teacher, God, we pray that you would say something today that goes beyond
[time=1711] any human insight, any personal understanding. May we find in you, any new word, a better
[time=1720] way. In Jesus' name, amen. We're delighted that each of you are here. We have observed
[time=1731] over the fall months as many people return to routines of schedule. The start of school,
[time=1737] there are many who have routinely returned to worship. Many of you have come back to Blackhawk from a summer of here or there, but many of you are visitors. We had last Sunday
[time=1748] approximately 300 more people than a year ago last Sunday. Many of you are visitors with
[time=1755] us. Let me just take a moment to explain a little bit of our philosophy of ministry on a Sunday morning. You may have walked in and today you've never been in a church quite like this one. Well, we have a number of purposes in our morning worship service. First and foremost,
[time=1771] our morning worship service is meant to be just that. It's meant to be worship. I'm so thankful for the creativity of the slides that are on the screen. That gives us an opportunity to worship by praising God. Blessed be the name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We sing that course sometimes. We said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul." That's worship today. And
[time=1792] the slides help so much. Instead of us going down there, "Bless the Lord," and singing right into that hymnbook, we sing to one another. That's part of our worship. As we hear, whether it's Dennis, a sing about God, that song is meant to be his offering and
[time=1807] our corporate worship of saying, "God, we praise you for who you are." As Lisa would
[time=1813] sing, "How great the art." That's just not a theme song for a television ministry. That's a concept today, a concept of life. That my life is to be lived for the glory of God.
[time=1824] Well, this is supposed to just be a little not message. It's a worship service. So come and worship and think about what you're hearing and seeing, but also sing with us. You may
[time=1835] not be able to sing. Well, that's all right. We say it too often, jokingly, but we mean it of heart. God wants us to bring forth a joyful sound. It may not be musically perfect, but
[time=1848] there's such joy and a sound that comes from the heart. Nowhere, when I was 76 years old,
[time=1855] he never ever sang. He was not a singer. But in a church musical, they asked him to sing
[time=1862] a song that went since I started towards the kingdom. Since my life, he controls. Since
[time=1868] I gave my heart to Jesus, the longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows. You know, when you sing that at 76, people look at a life. They don't listen to a song. You sing, join
[time=1879] in and worship the Lord. That's what we do. We worship the Lord. But secondly, we study principles from his word. We are a Bible study-centered church. If you come, we encourage
[time=1890] you to bring your Bible. You're welcome to come without it, but you'll get so much more if you do. Many times, people say, and I heard this three times last week. That's why I'm
[time=1900] saying it today. I've got a Bible, but I get lost. I don't understand the begats and the
[time=1909] ETHs on all the verbs and all that. You probably have what's called a King James Bible. It is an excellent Bible, and I encourage the use of the King James Bible. It's particularly
[time=1920] helpful to those of us who've been around churches for a while. But let me just suggest to you that if you really struggle to get what we call a new international Bible, the difference, not much, it's just King James lived at the beginning of the 1600s. We're
[time=1936] living at the end of the 1900s. Languages change, don't they? And with the change, they'll
[time=1942] become greater understanding with a translation like the new international that was written in the last decade. Inspired, taken from the original Greek in Hebrew and Aramaic transcripts,
[time=1954] but written in today's English. Why do I say all that? Because we want you to study the Bible. Today, it's kind of a sad day for me. This is our last study in Proverbs. Some of your price in praise the Lord. But I've loved this study in Proverbs. It has done so much to redirecting my thinking. I believe that in the last study that we've come to,
[time=1974] I've really found out what Solomon wanted. He wanted to give to his sons a better way.
[time=1980] He had grown up. He had had a mindset. He had had a philosophy of living. But he discovered
[time=1987] in the middle of life, there is a better way. And so Proverbs is a teaching of that better
[time=1994] way. And so this morning, I would like to give you five principles of the better way
[time=2000] that Solomon had for his sons. But by inspiration, God has reserved it and preserved it for
[time=2006] you and for me a better way. Some of you grew up during the days of the Depression. My parents
[time=2013] grew up in the days of the Depression. Some of you were parents in those days. Many of you lived through the catastrophic World War II. Out of those experiences, a whole generation
[time=2025] came through a Depression, came through a war, and they said, "I am going to provide a better
[time=2031] way, a better life for my children." And we got caught up in a better way of always providing
[time=2037] more, always seeking for prosperity. Out of the 60s, they came that counter-culture movement.
[time=2045] There was the majority movement out of the Depression that said the better way is prosperity.
[time=2049] The counter-culture said there's got to be something more than just prosperity. But
[time=2055] they came up with emptiness and now that generation has become the me generation. We have become totally narcissistic. We have said prosperity and for me, I don't care about the other guy. All these philosophies are converging and the generations are no
[time=2072] longer alienated from each other. We're all like an animal in a pig pen searching for the corn. We are rooting for a better way. There's no generation gap today. Young and
[time=2086] older life are on a desperate search trying to find out how can I live with meaning. Proverbs
[time=2095] says, "I want to give to you a better way." The word better, B-E-T-T-E-R occurs many, many
[time=2104] times in Proverbs. What I want to do is trace you through five of those. I want to put them into the fabric of my life. I want them woven in there. Five things that are part of the
[time=2114] better way. The first, turn with me to Proverbs 8. Proverbs 8, for those of you who are students
[time=2124] of literature and grammar. Chapter 8 is a masterpiece of literature. First of all, it
[time=2131] is a personification. Chapter 8 is though wisdom is a person, a female person. And so
[time=2139] when you come to the little personal pronoun, "I, me, are my," it's wisdom that is speaking
[time=2146] here. She's personified. It's as though she is alive in speaking to us. There are rich
[time=2152] analogies, tremendous, tremendous metaphors in here. Follow them with me, if you will.
[time=2158] Proverbs 8, I'm going to begin reading at verse 12, where the personification is so strong. "I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, I possess knowledge and discretion." To fear
[time=2174] the Lord is to hate evil. "I hate pride in arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech,
[time=2187] counsel, and some judgment are mine. I have understanding and power. By me, kings reign
[time=2198] and rulers make laws that are just. By me, princes govern and all nobles who rule on
[time=2207] earth. I love those who love me and those who seek me find me. With me are riches and
[time=2219] honor, enduring wealth and prosperity. My fruit is better than fine gold. What I yield surpasses
[time=2233] choice silver. I walk in the way of righteousness along the paths of justice, bestowing wealth
[time=2243] on those who love me and making their treasures full." Isn't that tremendous insight of literature?
[time=2253] The personification, as wisdom comes alive, it's so that it can be a voice and it can speak to us directly. The word better occurred in verse 19. Did you pick that up? I tried
[time=2265] to pause so you would see that. Verse 19, it says, "Better." Let me read it for you.
[time=2270] My fruit is better than fine gold. What I yield, economic terms here, we're always talking
[time=2280] about our yields, the investment into wisdom, the yield surpasses choice silver. Herein,
[time=2290] we're told the first thing that's part of the better way. Better wisdom than prosperity.
[time=2297] Better wisdom than prosperity. In the development of this literary device, a personification,
[time=2306] she talks about seven qualities of wisdom. I'd like to say wisdom in her seven sisters
[time=2312] to just to put that in my mind. But look back at verse 12. She begins to describe seven
[time=2319] words that may be purely synonymous with wisdom or maybe there are seven different facets of one diamond. But listen to them. One, prudence. Two, knowledge. Three, discretion. Verse 14.
[time=2340] Power. Counsel. Five. Sound. Judgment. Six. Understanding. Seven. Power. When you have
[time=2354] wisdom, you have wisdom and those seven sisters and those seven sisters are better than prosperity.
[time=2368] Verse 19, it says my fruit is better. What are the fruits of wisdom? I believe in this passage
[time=2377] we've just read, he gives us three different fruits that wisdom sets in her cornucopia
[time=2385] that pours out of her horn a plenty that spill across the table for us to take and to possess
[time=2392] if we possess wisdom. The first thing, the first fruit that you would get from wisdom
[time=2398] is the fruit of position. Look at verse 15. Wisdom says, by me, kings reign and rulers
[time=2408] make laws that are just. By me, princes govern and all nobles who rule on earth. I love those
[time=2415] who love me and those who seek me, find me. You see, it is wisdom that brings a person
[time=2422] up to position. In our society, there are three P's that people are always searching
[time=2428] for, position, prosperity and pleasure. How do you come to position in life? Some are
[time=2435] born in the position. One guy had an honest bumper sticker. He had a beautiful Mercedes-Benz.
[time=2441] It was obviously an expensive car and it said, Daddy's money. He came into his position
[time=2449] as prosperity by inheritance. Some of you have been born in the families with influence and
[time=2457] with power. In the days of Solomon, you were born a king son and you became a prince but Solomon was wise enough to know that there were distinctions among princes and that the
[time=2468] people in his court rose to power based upon their wisdom. You see, you can have a position
[time=2478] and fall from it for the lack of wisdom or you can have no position and rise to it because
[time=2485] of the gifts of wisdom. Position. It was the mid-1800s. Who a young lady married was very
[time=2495] important because who she would marry would determine her position in life. Two sisters
[time=2502] lived in Bedford, Ohio just outside of Cleveland. Each of the two sisters were dating different gentlemen. One of the gentlemen, a man by the name of Rutherford, had been suiting and courting
[time=2513] the oldest sister for some time and he had intentions of marriage. But the young lady
[time=2519] and her father were very concerned about his poor means and that out of his means he could
[time=2525] not provide her the appropriate position in life and so she severed the relationship with Rutherford. The other sister was dating another man from outside of Cleveland, a man by the
[time=2536] name of James and she followed her sister's example and she thought James could not provide
[time=2542] her the appropriate position in life and so she severed her relationship with James and
[time=2550] so two sisters discarded boyfriends, Rutherford and James because they could not provide the right position in life. Rutherford B. Hayes became the 19th president and James A. Garfield
[time=2562] became the 20th. Wise, wise father counseled those girls. You see he didn't have wisdom
[time=2571] and his wisdom said prosperity, go for prosperity. That's what produces position in life. Money
[time=2579] makes the world go around and make that your determining ethic and Solomon says better wisdom.
[time=2589] Better wisdom than prosperity because wisdom will bring you to the right position in life
[time=2597] when prosperity will not. The second fruit of wisdom, it not only brings you position
[time=2606] but it's now going to turn tables on you. It will bring you prosperity. You see it is
[time=2612] possible to have prosperity without having wisdom but in all likelihood you'll lose your prosperity but if you have wisdom you will ultimately come to prosperity by God's
[time=2624] economics principles and by honoring his word he'll give you a measure of success.
[time=2630] Look at verse 18, with me wisdom are riches and honor in during wealth and prosperity.
[time=2645] One will bring you a measure of prosperity. But prosperity without wisdom will not last.
[time=2654] Let me give you a glaring example of this. Way back in the 1960s a man by the name of
[time=2660] Keith Nicholson won what's the equivalent to our lottery over in London England. There
[time=2668] we go. I don't speak much. Over in London England he won a lottery on a soccer pool.
[time=2674] He won approximately one half a million dollars. Now that's back in 1960. You know how much
[time=2682] the average income was in 1958, five thousand dollars. This man in one day won one hundred
[time=2691] years worth of income. Now all the prosperity, listen to what happened. His wife announced
[time=2701] on the day they won the pool that she was going to do three things. Spend, spend and
[time=2707] spend. They went out and bought an enormous house, a mansion. Get this, for forty seven
[time=2714] thousand six hundred dollars. I don't know you could buy a house in Fort Wayne. But in
[time=2720] those days that was a mansion. They began to host a party every night of their life and in two years they spent a hundred and ninety six thousand dollars on their parties. The
[time=2734] husband won out and he bought a tremendous sports car for five thousand dollars. Today that get you a used bug. But in those days that really got you something that flew down the road. Tragically he was killed in an accident in that car in 1966. The money that was left
[time=2753] was put into a trust fund to care for his children and his wife and they received out
[time=2762] of that investment twenty five dollars a week. Could you imagine taking a half a million dollars
[time=2772] and reducing that to twenty five dollars a week? You see if you have prosperity and you
[time=2780] don't have wisdom all you have is a little bit of time before it's gone. But when you
[time=2788] have wisdom first it will give you a measure of prosperity and it will teach you the values
[time=2794] to use it right to give it away, to save it, to invest it, to spend it with discretion.
[time=2802] Wisdom will bring you a measure of prosperity. The third fruit that wisdom will give you
[time=2810] a part of the better way is it will give you proper values, proper values. Verses twenty
[time=2820] and twenty one. Wisdom says I walk in the pathway of righteousness along the paths of
[time=2830] justice. Where do you find wisdom? You find her walking along righteous paths and when
[time=2841] you keep company with her you will have proper values. There is an eminent American philosopher
[time=2852] and historian by the name of Will Durant. He has written volumes on Western civilization
[time=2859] in the history of it. Will and Ariel Durant his wife together wrote what are called lessons
[time=2865] of history. Let me give you one of Will Durant professor of history at Columbia University's
[time=2872] philosophies of life. A lesson from history. He writes, "As long as there is poverty there
[time=2881] will be the belief in God." The inference is that people who lack material goods will
[time=2888] search for spiritual satisfaction. The converse is also true. Material riches bring spiritual
[time=2896] poverty. Affluent youth who have long been sheltered from suffering and poverty do not
[time=2903] seek out the consolations of faith. You see when you have prosperity there comes a sense
[time=2910] of comfort and self-sufficiency. In this through adversity that we learn the spiritual disciplines
[time=2919] of life. Wisdom says I will discipline you. I will take you on the right paths and I will
[time=2925] give you the right values. But when we have prosperity as our God the values become shaky
[time=2932] at best. Five things that are better. The first wisdom is better than prosperity. Why? Because
[time=2941] when you have it you'll have position. You'll have the prosperity and you'll have proper
[time=2948] values. Now leap back to chapter 22 verse 1. Proverbs 22 verse 1. We spend a whole Sunday
[time=2957] on this concept. I'm sure you will remember much of it. But we come to our word better
[time=2963] once again. A good name is more desirable than great riches. And to be esteemed is better
[time=2976] than silver or gold. The second part of a better way. Better integrity than prosperity. Better
[time=2990] integrity than prosperity. Let's play a little game. Now you don't have to say it out loud
[time=2996] this time. But I'll say a name and you tell me or you tell yourself what comes to mind.
[time=3002] Richard Nixon. Probably for most of you what did not come to mind was vice president of
[time=3010] the United States under Eisenhower. It probably really didn't cross your mind first and foremost
[time=3016] president. Probably what crossed your mind was a single word, Watergate. When you hear
[time=3024] the name Nixon you think Watergate. What do you think of when you hear the name Joseph
[time=3030] Biden? Do you think of senator? Do you think of chairman of the judiciary committee? Probably
[time=3040] thought no he's the guy that doesn't remember where he placed in law school. What do you
[time=3046] think of when you hear the name Jim Baker? What do you think of when you hear the name Gary
[time=3055] Hart you think of people who compromised integrity for a measure of prosperity. You think of
[time=3068] a Richard Nixon who was so paranoid about the White House that he had to compromise integrity
[time=3075] and the lie in this card tapes and sneak and connive because he wanted that office again
[time=3082] and again. And so he compromised integrity. When you think of a Gary Hart you forget about
[time=3091] a new idea in a new generation you think about an old concept Donna Rice. You hear the name
[time=3100] Jim Baker don't think of the good old gospel. You think of a good old boy who lived off
[time=3108] of the gospel for himself. Better? Better integrity than in prosperity. Allow me to read to you
[time=3126] from my favorite author and writer Charles Swindall. Speaking about integrity he wrote
[time=3133] these words. Perhaps the decline of integrity can be partially attributed to the fact that
[time=3139] our social system has permitted even encouraged a divorce between a person's personal conduct
[time=3149] and their public or business conduct. It has become apparently an axiom within our society
[time=3158] that the public has no right to examine an individual's personal life as qualification for public office or employment. It seems naive however to suppose that the ethics and
[time=3173] morals of a person while at home will not sooner or later carry over to the job. Do we expect
[time=3182] for example that a person who flagrantly practices infidelity towards his or her own spouse will
[time=3191] not under certain conditions also become unfaithful to some aspect of his or her business or political
[time=3200] responsibility. Over 30 years ago Elton Trueblood wrote. It's hard to think of any job in which
[time=3210] the moral element is lacking. The skill of a dentist is wholly irrelevant if he is unprincipled
[time=3219] and unscrupulous. There is little in that case to keep him from withdrawing teeth unnecessarily
[time=3227] because the patient is usually helpless in that situation. It is easy to see the harm
[time=3235] that can be done by an unprincipled lawyer. Indeed such a man is far more dangerous if
[time=3241] he is skilled than if he is not skilled. Integrity. It's essential ingredient to life.
[time=3254] A good name is more desirable than great riches. To be esteemed is better than silver or gold.
[time=3264] Third. Better peace than prosperity. Chapter 17 verse one. Can you find that quickly?
[time=3276] Chapter 17 verse one. Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting
[time=3284] with strife. I don't watch shows like Dallas D and Dynasty. I told you I don't watch them
[time=3295] that much. But occasionally I catch a glimpse of those shows. Let's talk about the wonderful Ewing family for a moment. You know if you ever watch Dallas at all you will discover
[time=3306] that they eat. Family comes around the table all the time. You will also observe something.
[time=3312] The Ewing's very rarely finish a meal. I mean somebody is jabbing somebody else. Somebody
[time=3318] is manipulating the person across the table. Somebody has gouged the other in a business deal and it comes out across that table and all that fine food is thrown to the side and
[time=3330] somebody walks away. The scripture says better a dry crust with the cleavers than a house
[time=3345] full of feasting with the Ewing's. Let's tell you know who would you rather be? A Ewing
[time=3355] or a cleaver. I'm not sure that I'd always want to be treated like the cleavers but you
[time=3363] know something there was peace in that home wasn't there. You know that's why you and I like to watch those reruns. There was something about that family or something about those
[time=3374] relationships. Oh we know it wasn't real but we like to think it could be real in our lives. You know it can be when you put peace ahead of prosperity. Comes up again in chapter
[time=3387] 21 verse 9 he says Solomon says it's better to live up in the corner of the roof than
[time=3396] in a house with a quarrelsome ill-tempered woman. Ten verses later he repents. He says
[time=3403] that's not true. It's better to live in the desert. Get further away. And if Mrs. Solomon
[time=3414] had written it she would have said amen. Better to live in the desert than with a quarrelsome husband. Better peace than prosperity. Principle number 4 better love than prosperity. Chapter
[time=3430] 15 verse 17 says better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with
[time=3439] hatred. Do you ever sit down at the table and discover something? The food doesn't taste
[time=3448] so good when there's not peace and there's not love between those around it. Food doesn't
[time=3456] taste quite so good. The meat just doesn't taste quite as tender when the relationships
[time=3463] are tough. The vegetables aren't quite as crisp when the relationships have grown soft.
[time=3472] The dessert isn't quite as sweet when the marriage has gone better. It's better love
[time=3481] than prosperity. Finally, better godliness than prosperity. Better godliness than prosperity.
[time=3511] We've been sharing with you today our worship service with music from Dennis Kirschner and Lisa McNamara and our sanctuary choir. Then the message from God's word from our pastor Rick
[time=3521] Hawks. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning yourself following Christ as Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. Will you pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Christ to die on the cross
[time=3537] for my sins and I know that I have sin in my heart and I ask you to come in and to forgive me and to cleanse me of the sins that I've committed. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen. If
[time=3549] you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
