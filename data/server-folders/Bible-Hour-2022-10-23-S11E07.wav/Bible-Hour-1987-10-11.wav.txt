[time=110] A number of years ago, McCall's magazine did a survey of over 3,000 Protestant ministers.
[time=118] The results included the facts that many of them did not believe in a personal God.
[time=126] And even a greater number of them denied the virgin birth and denied the deity of Jesus Christ.
[time=134] In a word, it is called apostasy, the falling away of the church.
[time=142] And history records that no university and no church that has ever gone the way of apostasy has ever returned again.
[time=154] [MUSIC]
[time=164] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour. Thank you for joining us. Today we launch an exciting new study in the book of Jude.
[time=174] This short epistle is one of the most neglected in all the New Testament, yet its message is as relevant as today's headlines.
[time=181] Today's message and this series of studies in Jude is entitled Acts of the Apostates.
[time=186] Apostasy refers to a departure of falling away from biblical doctrine, a condition sweeping through our churches.
[time=193] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us as we look at Jude 1 through 4.
[time=198] Our special music today includes a song from the Sanctuary Choir, a number from the Hanville Choir, and a solo from Denise Mitchell.
[time=210] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=219] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=224] Now, here's Rick.
[time=226] It is the first time that God will use this time together to strengthen your faith in Him.
[time=256] [MUSIC - 234 seconds]
[time=496] Thank you, choir.
[time=497] Hallelujah.
[time=498] That word of Hebrew praise carried into our culture.
[time=502] It means the highest praise beat to the Lord.
[time=505] We're delighted that you're here on Sunday morning and you're familiar with what happens here on Sunday mornings.
[time=512] But on Friday mornings there's an equally exciting ministry called Super Sixties.
[time=517] It was begun nine years ago by George and his wife Mary as they began an adventure called Super Sixties.
[time=525] And just about eight days ago on their ninth anniversary they had an exciting meeting.
[time=529] And we've asked George to come and to share some of the details and events that happened at that ninth anniversary.
[time=535] George?
[time=536] Well Rick, I'm going to share some numbers with you.
[time=538] And they may not mean much to you or not much to these people here.
[time=542] But three to four thousand is one number and 550 is another number.
[time=547] 130 is another number.
[time=549] 90, 30 to 40 and we have 15 to 20 and then eight to 10, 26 and one.
[time=558] Now it doesn't mean much to you does it?
[time=560] No, but you can help me out I'm sure.
[time=562] Alright, the Super Sixties have ministered to somewhere between three and four thousand people in the nine years.
[time=569] They've been there at least once, they've heard the gospel.
[time=572] There were 550 that attended the Super Sixties ninth anniversary and there were from 130 different churches.
[time=583] So it's an outreach ministry, we can see that.
[time=586] There were 90 people who were first-time visitors and there are 30 to 40 people who help every Friday come in here and working in these co-labors.
[time=596] And then there are 15 to 20 that have come and they don't know the Lord, many of them, but they have received the Lord.
[time=607] And eight to ten are from other churches.
[time=610] They come and help on Friday, which is a blessing to me.
[time=614] Twenty-six is the number I want to share with you, Rick.
[time=616] I know that number.
[time=617] That is exciting. Please do share that.
[time=619] That's the number of people who received Jesus Christ as their Savior at that one meeting and we thank God for that.
[time=625] I shared that with one of the co-labors and they said if one had received Christ it had been worth it.
[time=630] And then the number one, I want to give all the glory to God.
[time=634] He's the one who gets the glory, not us.
[time=637] We're co-labors just working along with him and we thank God for what he's done in that ministry.
[time=642] We would ask each one of you to faithfully pray for that ministry each Friday as it reaches out in this neighborhood
[time=649] and beyond this neighborhood and other communities with the gospel Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=653] George, before you sit down, would you do just that and lead us in prayer, praying that God would continue to you super-60s to reach senior adults for Christ?
[time=662] Shall we pray?
[time=664] God, our Heavenly Father, we thank you for the ministries of Black Hawk Baptist Church, the way you've blessed this church and the way you've blessed the ministries.
[time=673] Thank you for super-60s.
[time=675] It reaches out into this community and beyond to those who are senior adults.
[time=680] Thank you for the way you've blessed that ministry and used it in the hearts of people, bringing people to Christ, bringing others closer to Him and bringing people, yes, into the ministry of this church.
[time=691] So we pray that I bless upon each one who helps each Friday as a co-labor.
[time=695] Thank you for each one of those who served the Lord in this way, and we pray that you continue to bless this ministry and use it to glorify yourself.
[time=705] Before we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=708] Thank you, George.
[time=710] If you have your hymnbook, please take it out to hymn 155 and Peter will lead us in singing at Calvary.
[time=726] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=731] [MUSIC - 311 seconds]
[time=1052] [MUSIC] We're standing at the door [MUSIC] Once again he knocks upon what sin has locked [MUSIC] Though we know we hold the power [MUSIC] Yet in this lonely hour he leaves the choice to you [MUSIC] For he will not intrude [MUSIC] It's by invitation only [MUSIC] Only if will he take us away [MUSIC] Heal away your scars [MUSIC] By invitation only [MUSIC] Will he fill the heart that's going to be [MUSIC] Only wants to be invited [MUSIC] All he wants is you to call on him [MUSIC] He hold his royal majesty [MUSIC] Above all detail [MUSIC] His righteousness exits [MUSIC] Holy king of all domains [MUSIC] Yet he patiently remains [MUSIC] Excellent and blessed [MUSIC] Awaiting your request [MUSIC] It's by invitation only [MUSIC] That you'll come into your heart [MUSIC] Only then you'll take your sin [MUSIC] Heal away your scars [MUSIC] By invitation only [MUSIC] Will he fill the heart that's going to be [MUSIC] Only wants to be invited [MUSIC] All he wants is you to call on him [MUSIC] Is by invitation only [MUSIC] That you'll come into your heart [MUSIC] Only then you'll take your sin [MUSIC] Heal away your scars [MUSIC] By invitation only [MUSIC] Will he fill the heart that's going to be [MUSIC] Only wants to be invited [MUSIC] All he wants is you to call on him [MUSIC]â™ª
[time=1591] Thank you, Denise.
[time=1593] Jesus said in Revelation 3.20, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock, and if anyone hear my voice and will open the door, I will come in and live with him and he with me." Jesus only enters into the life to which he is invited.
[time=1611] He only occupies those spaces that we vacate for him.
[time=1616] He's not like the wolf in the children's story who says, "I'm going to huff and I'm going to forcefully take over your life."
[time=1625] He stands and he knocks.
[time=1627] And he asks your permission to come in.
[time=1630] Would you today invite Jesus Christ to come into your life?
[time=1635] Well, Lord Jesus, we pray today that through the speaking of your spirit we would hear your voice.
[time=1642] We would sense the knocking at the door.
[time=1646] God, may each of us today find you speaking.
[time=1650] We ask you to be present, Lord.
[time=1653] You have promised that we're two or three would gather in your name that you would be there.
[time=1660] And we meet today in your name, Lord Jesus, and we invite, we beg you to be present.
[time=1668] God, we ask you to bring into captivity our every thought that we would not be distracted by the cares of this world, the issues of life other than those that are on your agenda today.
[time=1683] God, only you can speak to the spirit of a woman, to the heart of a man, to the will of a teenager.
[time=1692] And God, we ask you to so speak today to give a word of encouragement, a word of correction that we might today bring our lives into a closer conformity with you, our Savior.
[time=1706] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1712] It was a number of years ago that McCall's magazine did a survey of over 3,000 Protestant ministers,
[time=1723] men just like myself.
[time=1726] In this survey, questions were asked about specific beliefs.
[time=1730] The results were alarming.
[time=1733] A significant number of these ministers declared that they doubted the existence of a personal God and preferred to think of God not as a person but simply as a force of love.
[time=1748] An even greater number said that they did not believe that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God in the traditional meaning of those words.
[time=1758] An even greater number said that the virgin birth was not a doctrine to be held or to believed.
[time=1768] That condition in a word is called apostasy.
[time=1772] Apostasy means people who have come to a particular position,
[time=1778] they have embraced a concept and they now have turned and they have fallen away.
[time=1786] It is the epidemic of our generation that we are compromises both on convictions of belief
[time=1796] and convictions of lifestyle.
[time=1800] In the New Testament, one particular book was written as a warning and a correction to this situation called apostasy.
[time=1810] It's called the book of Jude.
[time=1812] And if you have your Bible, please turn with me as I've opened mine to the book of Jude.
[time=1818] For those new to Bible study, the last book in the Bible is the book of Revelation and Jude precedes it.
[time=1825] So it's the 65th of the 66 books of the Bible.
[time=1830] It's a very short book.
[time=1832] It is an epistle, which means a New Testament letter, but it's more like a memo.
[time=1838] It's short, it's to the point, and it's very, very potent.
[time=1842] I would like to read the first four verses for you this morning, and I use a Bible called a new international version, which is an accurate translation given in today's English.
[time=1854] Jude 1.
[time=1856] Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and a brother of James, to those who have been called, who are loved by God, the Father, and kept by Jesus Christ.
[time=1872] Mercy, peace, and love.
[time=1875] Be yours in abundance.
[time=1879] Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share,
[time=1888] I felt I had to write to you and urge you to contend for the faith
[time=1894] that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
[time=1900] For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago
[time=1908] have secretly slipped in among you.
[time=1915] They are godless men who change the grace of our God
[time=1921] into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ
[time=1930] our sovereign and Lord.
[time=1934] We've read these first four verses today because it gives to us the purpose of this book, it talks about people who have crept in, they become a part of a church just like this church.
[time=1947] Don't think of men walking around in tunics and women with these veils over and things that happen way back in history.
[time=1955] This is not a history lesson today.
[time=1958] This is a lesson in contemporary Christianity.
[time=1962] There were those then and there are those today who come into church.
[time=1967] They, on the external appearance, seem to embrace Jesus Christ and the concept of life that he gives, but at some point actually turn traitor to that cause both in conviction
[time=1981] of lifestyle and confession of Jesus as Lord.
[time=1987] In the times in which we live, there is a spirit that says, "Wouldn't it be great if we all got together and we would embrace one another and come together on that which we hold in common?" It's called an ecumenical movement and it is a lovely thought.
[time=2004] I mean, it is a lovely thought to think that everybody of every denomination of every church would all come together.
[time=2011] There's something romantic about that.
[time=2014] There's something euphoric that has to appeal to the year, but it shouldn't appeal to the mind.
[time=2021] For you see, whenever people come together, the only base on which they can come together is an ever-shrinking platform.
[time=2029] Let me illustrate.
[time=2031] If this group over here has ten beliefs that they hold to as convictions,
[time=2043] and they want to come together, but they only hold five convictions in common.
[time=2051] This group will never add five convictions of this church to theirs, and that group will never add five of their convictions.
[time=2059] Each group will be forced to drop half of their convictions and come together on the five they hold in common.
[time=2067] And now this new group only has five convictions.
[time=2071] And they now, as a new synthesis, say we want to become even more embracing and embrace this group over here because they only have five convictions,
[time=2082] but of their five and of these five, they only hold two in common.
[time=2089] And now the platform is a conviction of two, and it is an ever-shrinking base.
[time=2097] You see, there has been in church history from the day Jesus Christ ascended to heaven
[time=2103] to this very moment a concept of taking what the scriptures teach and always adding water to diminish it, to discard it, or to set it far enough aside because we want to be more embracing.
[time=2118] Well, there's always something lovely about wanting to embrace, yet there needs to be a commitment of doctrine that would stand in the face of apostasy.
[time=2131] This isn't today's lesson, but just notice in verse four, these men are described in three ways.
[time=2138] First of all, bluntly and directly, they're called ungodly.
[time=2143] But then secondly, specific descriptions, it says first of all, they have turned, they've twisted, they've changed the grace of God into a license for immorality.
[time=2155] Here's what they've basically done.
[time=2157] These people have said, "Listen, God loves you.
[time=2162] God gives grace, and no matter how much you sin, God's got more grace, and don't worry about any type of values,
[time=2171] or laws, or philosophies, just enjoy the fact that God loves you."
[time=2178] And God wants you to be happy, and if the way that you would be happy is to express yourself sexually with whomever and whenever you want, you just do that because God's a God of grace, and He wants you to enjoy His grace.
[time=2196] That's what they said back then.
[time=2199] Today they say, "Well, God would want me to be happy." So it's all right if I marry an unbeliever, God wouldn't want me to be lonely, and His grace will cover that.
[time=2209] Well, God knows we're not married, but we love each other, so it's okay if we sexually encounter each other, that will make our relationship so much more meaningful, and God's grace will cover that.
[time=2222] That's what they did.
[time=2223] They turned grace into a permission slip.
[time=2226] It's called apostasy.
[time=2228] But also in the area of doctrine, these men came into a church.
[time=2232] The church has the name of Jesus Christ, and they deny that Jesus Christ is Lord,
[time=2241] that He's sovereign, that He is God, that He is Lord at all.
[time=2245] They deny that.
[time=2247] And you know that today there are many, many churches that are meeting at this very hour, and they have somewhere in their name Christian, somewhere in their articles of faith that they are a Christian church, and their concept of Jesus, He was a man.
[time=2266] Good man, but He was just a man.
[time=2270] That's what Jude is writing about, the timeless problem of apostasy.
[time=2277] Well, allow me to, before we even begin our study, to give you three quick overviews of the book of Jude.
[time=2285] The first is this, the theme is apostasy, and because of that theme, it is a timeless book, more relevant than anything we could possibly be reading today.
[time=2298] Second observation is, this is deep stuff.
[time=2302] I mean, Jude is not like John.
[time=2305] Man, I'm all for reading the Gospel of John, but Gospel of John's pretty easy stuff.
[time=2310] I mean, you just read and says God loves you, and you ought to love one another, and well, that flows.
[time=2315] This stuff gets heavy.
[time=2317] He starts talking about Michael, the Archangel, disputing with the devil over the body of Moses.
[time=2322] You ever heard that stuff before?
[time=2324] I mean, you're gonna have to do some digging to follow through all this.
[time=2327] He starts talking about those who have gone the way of Balaam or who have followed in the way of Chora.
[time=2335] Deep stuff.
[time=2338] You're stuff you're gonna have to read more than once, but it's worth the digging.
[time=2345] And thirdly, this short epistle, 25 verses, is a literary masterpiece.
[time=2352] For those of you who are literature students or teachers, you'll enjoy reading this book.
[time=2358] It is full of analogies and symbols and metaphors.
[time=2363] Just jumping in at verse 12.
[time=2365] He said, "These men are blemishes at your love feast, eating with you without the slightest qualm, shepherds who feed only themselves, clouds without rain, blown along by the wind, autumn trees without fruit, uprooted and twice dead." You see that repetition of metaphor, blemishes, shepherds, clouds, trees, rich literature here.
[time=2391] And he uses a device called triads.
[time=2394] He uses threes repetitiously.
[time=2398] Now the day we're going to go as far into verses 1 and 2 as we can, but let me show you some of these threes.
[time=2404] Look at verse 1, it says, "Jude, that is the author."
[time=2410] Then a few words later it says, "To those who have been called, those are the recipients." And then a greeting, mercy, peace and love.
[time=2419] So there are three things that happen in the introduction.
[time=2422] The identification of the author, the identification of the recipients, and an identification of a greeting.
[time=2429] So you have three parts, and each of those three have three parts.
[time=2435] Jude gives his name, then secondly he gives a description that he's a servant, and then he gives a description thirdly that he's a brother.
[time=2444] When he comes to the recipients, he gives three descriptions.
[time=2447] He says to those who are called, to those who are loved, to those who are kept.
[time=2453] Then he comes to the greeting, and he says three things, mercy, peace and love.
[time=2459] Do you see that three threes?
[time=2461] And as we go through it, there'll be threes upon threes.
[time=2464] That's his writing style.
[time=2465] So if you like literature, you can dig into all those threes this next week.
[time=2470] Let's talk about these early verses.
[time=2473] The way that a New Testament writer or anyone of antiquity wrote was very different than the way we write today.
[time=2480] They write letters like we write memos.
[time=2483] Now when you get a memo in the office, it'll start off by saying the memo who it's to, it'll give the subject of the memo, and who it's from, right up front.
[time=2493] Letters, we don't do that.
[time=2495] We put who it's to, but we get all the way to the end before we say who it's from.
[time=2499] Now tell the truth, do you ever read a multi-page letter without at least looking to see who wrote it to you?
[time=2506] Some were at the end of the letter, or on the return address, or somehow you identify who wrote that letter.
[time=2513] I mean, you don't read a four-page letter, and at the end of it say, Fred, I never knew Fred thought all of those things.
[time=2519] No, you would have gone to that right away.
[time=2521] These guys were just smarter than we were.
[time=2524] They put it right up front.
[time=2527] Also, these little words of greeting, love, mercy, and peace, they put them right up front.
[time=2533] We put those at the end.
[time=2535] We sign business letters like this, sincerely, or yours truly.
[time=2540] But you remember back to your date of court dating and courtship?
[time=2544] Remember the things used to put at the end of a letter?
[time=2547] Now, my wife has kept all of those letters.
[time=2551] I have pleaded with her that they be destroyed.
[time=2554] They are incriminating.
[time=2556] But up on our attic, there's this box of letters.
[time=2559] Long before I ever proposed to her, I indicted myself.
[time=2563] I mean, I said yours for ever.
[time=2568] Hey, you guys remember saying some of that stuff?
[time=2570] I even bought her a watch.
[time=2572] We were just dating.
[time=2573] And on the back of it, it said, I'm always yours forever yours.
[time=2576] Man, that's incriminating stuff.
[time=2578] You know, I remember getting letters, too.
[time=2581] I recognized the handwriting.
[time=2583] Those were from Kathy.
[time=2584] I was over there at Grace Seminary.
[time=2586] Grace Seminary.
[time=2587] She was a little Freudian slipper.
[time=2590] She was in Akron, Ohio.
[time=2591] And these letters would come.
[time=2593] You know, with the flowery envelopes, I knew who they were from.
[time=2597] And I recognized that address on Jeannie J. Drive.
[time=2601] Jeannie J. Drive.
[time=2602] That's where she lived in Akron, Ohio.
[time=2604] And I'd open those up.
[time=2605] You know, the first, I went for the end of the seat.
[time=2607] Did she say it?
[time=2609] You know, none of this sincerely business.
[time=2611] Did she say love Kathy?
[time=2614] Or did she say something incriminating like forever yours?
[time=2618] You know, is there something I can bank on there?
[time=2620] Hey, those are precious words, aren't they?
[time=2623] You know, those were precious words to Jude.
[time=2627] When he thought of those people that he was writing, he wasn't scribbling out a yours truly at the end of it.
[time=2634] He was coming right to them in letter and saying, "Jude, to you.
[time=2641] I wish God's mercy.
[time=2643] I wish God's peace.
[time=2646] I wish God's love." Wow, they put that right up front.
[time=2652] We put it up front in emotions.
[time=2654] We just put it at the end of the letter.
[time=2656] That's how they wrote letters.
[time=2657] Well, let's look at these three of three.
[time=2661] First of all, the first three, the author, describes himself, first of all, by the name Jude.
[time=2670] There is another way of pronouncing this name Jude.
[time=2675] It is to change that E to an A and add an S.
[time=2681] The name Jude is the same as the name Judas.
[time=2685] Now, that sounds a lot more familiar to us, doesn't it?
[time=2687] There's something about that name Judas that rings bells that Jude sounds just a little for.
[time=2693] It's the same name.
[time=2695] Now, there are at least five different Jude or Judas is in the Bible.
[time=2700] Let me give those to you very quickly.
[time=2702] One Jude is a man who's the Judas of Damascus.
[time=2706] Do you remember the story, and it's actually not just a story, but the history, of the conversion of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2713] Paul is on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians.
[time=2718] He's going to slay them.
[time=2719] He's going to incarcerate them.
[time=2721] But Jesus appears to him as a bright light that literally knocks him to the ground
[time=2727] and strikes him blind.
[time=2729] He is then led by hand into the city of Damascus as the Lord instructs him
[time=2736] to the house of a man by the name of Judas.
[time=2741] And the Bible actually tells us his street.
[time=2743] He lived on Straight Street.
[time=2745] Judas of Straight Street is where Paul went and was found praying in Acts chapter 9.
[time=2751] That's one Judas.
[time=2753] There's another Judas in the Bible that's very unfamiliar to us.
[time=2757] That is Judas Barsobas.
[time=2759] You've probably never heard of Judas Barsobas.
[time=2762] Judas lived in Jerusalem.
[time=2765] And there came a point in the life of the early churches where some decisions had to be made so they had the first church council.
[time=2773] Representatives of churches in various communities came to Jerusalem and they made some collective decisions.
[time=2779] And then they said, let's send out Paul and Barnabas.
[time=2784] They carried these letters of recommendation to the various churches and let's send with them also Silas and Judas Barsobas.
[time=2793] He was a leader in the Church of Jerusalem.
[time=2796] There is a third Judas that is far more familiar to each of us.
[time=2800] The most famous are infamous of all the Judas' Judas Assyrian.
[time=2807] He was one of the original twelve disciples.
[time=2810] And as you probably know, he was the culprit who betrayed Christ with a kiss.
[time=2818] And shortly after that, overcome by the guilt of it all, he took his own life.
[time=2824] There is a fourth Judas who, like Judas Ascariot, was a disciple of Christ.
[time=2831] But he had two names.
[time=2832] One name was Judas.
[time=2834] And that's how Luke and John refer to him.
[time=2837] But Matthew and Mark use a different name.
[time=2841] It is the name Thaddeus.
[time=2843] You know, when you run through those lists of disciples, you'll come occasionally to the name Thaddeus and you'll come to the name Bartholomew.
[time=2852] But on another list, you'll find the Thaddeus and you'll find the Bartholomew.
[time=2856] You'll find a Nathaniel.
[time=2858] And you'll find that Nathaniel is the same as Bartholomew.
[time=2864] And you'll find the Judas and that is the same as Thaddeus.
[time=2869] One of the original twelve disciples.
[time=2872] Now there is a fifth man in the New Testament who carries the name Judas.
[time=2879] Keep your bulletin or finger here in Jude and turn to Matthew chapter 13.
[time=2886] Matthew chapter 13 in verse 55.
[time=2889] While you're finding the page, allow me to stage the context.
[time=2894] Jesus has just given a number of parables about the kingdom of God.
[time=2899] People have marveled at his teaching and been amazed at his authority.
[time=2905] But some are skeptical and say, "Who is this man to teach this way?
[time=2910] Who is he to make these statements?" And here are their rhetorical questions in verse 55.
[time=2919] Isn't this the carpenter's son?
[time=2927] Isn't his mother's name Mary?
[time=2932] And aren't these his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
[time=2943] Aren't all his sisters with us?
[time=2948] Where then did this man get all these things?
[time=2953] What Matthew is telling us is that after Jesus was born,
[time=2959] Joseph took Mary to be his wife and they had natural biological children.
[time=2966] Many.
[time=2967] At least four sons, they're named here for us.
[time=2970] Their names are given.
[time=2971] They are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas.
[time=2976] And along with those four brothers it says, "And sisters." There are over nine references in the New Testament to the fact that Jesus had what we would call
[time=2988] half brothers and half sisters.
[time=2991] They were not his full brothers because Mary conceived of Jesus of the Holy Ghost.
[time=2998] She was a virgin at conception.
[time=3001] She was a virgin at delivery.
[time=3004] Jesus was only half brother to those who were born biologically of Joseph and Mary.
[time=3012] But there are nine references to that.
[time=3017] In these references we discover that in Jesus' ministry his brothers were not believers.
[time=3024] Here's what John chapter 7 verse 5 says, "For even his own brothers did not believe in him."
[time=3032] Now at this particular point I would like to draw two quick applications from all that we've said so far.
[time=3040] The first application is very doctrinal.
[time=3044] As I stated there are nine references to Jesus having brothers and sisters and the doctrinal application is this.
[time=3053] Mary did not remain a perpetual virgin.
[time=3058] There will be some who will teach that Mary remained a perpetual virgin.
[time=3064] What they are actually trying to do is they're trying to set Mary as a breed apart from all other humanity
[time=3071] and they're trying to shroud her in some super spirituality that elevates her above all other humanity
[time=3078] and sets her up as an intermediary between us and God and us and Christ.
[time=3084] But there are nine references to the fact that she gave birth to other children that you cannot explain away.
[time=3091] I want to give those to you in case this is running contrary to what you've been taught or believed all your life.
[time=3098] I'll just give you the references.
[time=3099] They are Matthew 1246, Matthew 1355, Mark 331, Mark 63, John 212, John 73, and John.
[time=3119] 7, 3, and 5, Acts 1, 13, and 14, 1 Corinthians 9, 5, Galatians 1, 19.
[time=3136] Now some will try to say well we use the word brother to describe somebody who we have a kinship relationship.
[time=3143] Doesn't John always speak to other Christians as brothers in the Lord? Yes that is true.
[time=3149] But that doesn't mean that you can take the filial sense out of the word brother every time it occurs in Scripture.
[time=3156] If you look just at one reference I'll turn to Galatians chapter 1 of those reference and verse 19,
[time=3167] Verse 18, Paul said, "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.
[time=3178] I saw none of the other apostles only James the Lord's brother."
[time=3186] You see the term Lord's brother is being set as a distinction from all the other apostles.
[time=3193] If the word brother was meant to be assumed in a very generic sense of fellow believers then it would not have been used to distinguish this James from the other apostles of which there were two other James.
[time=3208] This was an attempt to clarify which of three James the one that was the Lord's brother.
[time=3215] You see the scriptures teach that there is one God and only one mediator between God and man and it is Jesus Christ.
[time=3228] You and I, we are not worthy to come to God, that is true.
[time=3234] But Jesus has come as an intermediary to stand between us and God and it is him and him alone.
[time=3243] There is one God and one mediator, the man Jesus Christ.
[time=3247] Mary cannot intervene for you, no saint living or dead can intervene for you.
[time=3252] There is only one name given amongst men whereby we must be saint.
[time=3257] It is the name of Jesus and in his name every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that he is the Lord.
[time=3268] A second application of all this is very practical.
[time=3275] When you come to Christ there is an enthusiasm and a contagious desire to share Christ with other people and that ought never to leave us.
[time=3285] And you know as we share Christ you know who the hardest people to reach are our family.
[time=3292] The people in our own house, our extended family are the hardest ones to reach.
[time=3297] Just be encouraged to know it has always been that way.
[time=3301] Literally thousands and thousands and thousands of people are following Christ to the point where he says,
[time=3307] "Peter, get us a boat to get out of here." And he jumps on the boat and they sail across the lake to get away from all the people who believed on him.
[time=3315] And with thousands of believers his own brothers, nah.
[time=3322] He can't be the Messiah.
[time=3325] The hardest people to reach are always those in our own family.
[time=3330] But James and Jude did come to faith in Christ after the resurrection.
[time=3337] And that's when your family and mine will come to Christ after they see the resurrection, the resurrection of Christ living in you.
[time=3349] You see when they see an undeniable Christ alive in you that's when they will believe.
[time=3359] Well that's the first way we meet the author by name Jude.
[time=3364] We meet him a second way as he describes himself as a servant.
[time=3368] He says, "James a servant of the Lord." It speaks words of humility.
[time=3375] If you were the brother of the Lord and you were writing to the churches, I mean you talk about cloud.
[time=3381] This is a guy who could have said, Jude, brother of the Lord.
[time=3389] Man that's got some cloud.
[time=3391] You know being somebody's brother really makes you significant.
[time=3394] I've noticed some investment corporations.
[time=3396] I don't know whether they're getting cheap and they don't want to hire the big name people or what they're playing.
[time=3400] But they're hiring the brothers. I saw Paul Newman's brother the other day on television advertising something.
[time=3406] And then Walter Payton's brother, he's advertising him because when you're somebody's brother in our society that means you're something.
[time=3415] Jude could have said, "Jude, Jesus brother." He could have elevated himself in a pompous way to presume superiority over everybody else.
[time=3427] But he didn't. He said, "Jude, a servant."
[time=3434] That's the word do-loss. It means slave.
[time=3438] You know many of us came to Christianity and faith in Christ I fear under false pretenses.
[time=3444] Somebody said, "Come to Christ. He's got a wonderful life for you. He may give you what you are thinking of as a wonderful life."
[time=3451] But he said, "If you come unto me, you'll have trial. You'll have tribulation." Some of you came to Christ because somebody said, "You've been through drugs. You've been through hiddenism. You've been through selfishness. Just try Jesus. You don't try Jesus. You surrender to him."
[time=3467] You see when you come to Christ you come as a slave to live a life as a slave and you're saying, "I'll be dead to myself. This is no longer my life. This is no longer my body. This is no longer my mind. It belongs to Christ.
[time=3485] And I'll give it fully and yieldably to him. I am a servant. I am a slave. He is my master."
[time=3493] Have you come to Christ fully and completely and made him your master and made yourself his slave?
[time=3516] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our handbell choir directed by Rich Ledeke, and soloist Denise Mitchell, and then the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3527] In a day when there seems to be a great deal of false teaching, I can tell you right now that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=3536] And if you'd like to receive him as Savior, I'd like to have you bow and pray this prayer with me.
[time=3542] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3549] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come in and to cleanse me, and I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3556] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
