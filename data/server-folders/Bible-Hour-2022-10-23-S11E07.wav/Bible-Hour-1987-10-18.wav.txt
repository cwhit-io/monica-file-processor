[time=113] The Lord Jesus gave two promises for each of us to possess.
[time=118] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=121] And if anyone hears my voice and will open the door, Christ said, "I will come in." That is the first of His promises, "I will come in." In Hebrews 13, 5, the second promise, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee." The two promises of Christ, "I will come in, I will not leave." (crickets chirping)
[time=157] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoffs.
[time=160] Thank you for joining us.
[time=161] Today, Rick is continuing his series from the book of Jude where the message he has entitled, "kept to keep on." Is your Christian life one of joy and confidence or fear and apprehension?
[time=173] Christ promised that he would never leave us nor forsake us is the sole base for eternal hope and security.
[time=179] He has promised to keep us.
[time=182] What confidence and joy is available to the believer who knows his eternal hope is forever eternally secure.
[time=188] Don't think for a moment that eternal security is a license to live in sin.
[time=192] Just the opposite is true.
[time=195] God keeps us so that we can keep on growing and serving Him.
[time=198] We are kept to keep on.
[time=201] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=205] We will be looking at Jude verses one through four.
[time=208] Special music today will be brought to us by the sanctuary choir, rejoice, and the men's singers quartet.
[time=219] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=226] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=231] Now here's Rick.
[time=232] This morning to our morning worship service, we also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=240] Peter said in his first epistle that you know that you were not bought with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish.
[time=256] Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God.
[time=263] [MUSIC - 183 seconds]
[time=473] Because of the Lamb of God, we can place our feet on a sure foundation and say that our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness, Him number 423.
[time=485] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas of the solid rock, 423.
[time=504] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=606] Thank you very much for your singing.
[time=608] For the last two weeks, we've had a green card in the bulletin asking you to sign up for various committees and responsibilities as it relates to the living Christmas tree.
[time=618] I might remind some of you that if you signed up for singing in the living Christmas tree, you need to be here in the chapel at 4.30 today.
[time=626] And if you are sort of thinking about singing in the tree, this is your last day to make that decision.
[time=632] If you want to sing in the singing Christmas tree choir, come today to the chapel at 4.30.
[time=638] It's a great time of fellowship, a great ministry, and we thank the rest of you who have signed up to take other responsibilities.
[time=645] And we will be checking with you in the weeks to come as it relates to preparation.
[time=650] Rejoice is one of our singing ensembles last year.
[time=653] This is their second year.
[time=654] They're directed by Darlene Johnson.
[time=656] We appreciate the ministry of these ladies.
[time=659] Let's listen to them now as they sing a song entitled, "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord."
[time=675] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord that every time that best he reigns without his nailing praises forever proclaim."
[time=697] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord that no his mighty deeds do all take up the call that every nation know."
[time=706] "The Israel, Messiah, our Savior, and our King, let all our forces join us one and fill the earth with singing."
[time=715] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord that every race on every shore."
[time=724] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord."
[time=731] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord give honor to the prince of peace, for if we cease the stones will start shouting."
[time=746] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord with hands uplifted, let us raise your mortal face and give the reigns on high."
[time=756] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord that every race on every shore." "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord he is all our Messiah." "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord he is all our Messiah."
[time=770] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord." "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord he is all our Messiah."
[time=784] "Our Savior and our King, let all our voices join us one and fill the earth with singing."
[time=791] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord his grace we applaud, let every race on every shore."
[time=800] "Proclaim the Glory, Proclaim the Glory, Proclaim the Glory, Proclaim the Glory."
[time=809] "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord."
[time=819] Thank you for joining us again today here on the Bible Hour.
[time=827] We trust that as we sing praises to our God, as you hear the choir and soloists sing, and as we study God's Word, there comes a conviction to your heart to follow Jesus Christ wholly and fully in your personal life.
[time=841] We're delighted that you're a part of our ministry today and want to encourage to write to us and let us know how the Bible hour is being used in your life and just a few moments we'll give you the address so you can do that.
[time=854] But as you write, please do not write for living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=858] I wish Pete that we could tell everybody who wants to write to write, but by the time you write, we are out of tickets for the day you ask.
[time=865] We send you back a letter, giving you the available dates you write back, and by the time we get your second letter, they're all gone, and we have nothing but frustration and misunderstanding, and we just have to ask you to come and pick up the tickets in person.
[time=878] Pete, how can they do that?
[time=880] Well, Rick, we said to say today it's November 14th.
[time=883] That's a Saturday, and we have hundreds of people that come to our Convocation Center on that day, and we begin at eight o'clock, and you're here just for a short time, you get a number, and you can personally receive eight tickets.
[time=895] That is eight tickets per person that comes that day to pick up tickets, so reserve the date of November 14th and come, and you'll have the selection before you, and that will expedite being sure that you get the day and time that you want to come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=912] Well, we're looking forward to sharing the tree with our community and with each of you, and do hope that you'll come.
[time=918] It's a great opportunity for Pete and for myself, as we get to meet many, many of our friends who join us by way of television that we've never had a chance to shake their hand and to greet them personally, so we do want you to come and to come on November 14th to pick up your tickets, and we'll remind you each Sunday between now and then, so you won't forget.
[time=938] Today we have a pamphlet to share with you called the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air.
[time=944] This is a pamphlet that I received a number of years ago as a young man, and it so helped me to sort through the scriptural teaching on some key doctrines.
[time=953] That's the Spirit of Truth, what the Scripture say about God, about the Lord Jesus Christ, about sin, forgiveness, redemption, and eternal life.
[time=963] That's the Spirit of Truth, and it also gives us the Spirit of Air.
[time=968] It looks at some of the cults, some of the popular yet false teachers that have arisen, particularly on the American scene, have started movements of churches that have intermixed a little of the truth
[time=982] with a little more air and have made a distortion of the scriptures.
[time=986] How can you know the difference?
[time=988] What each says, this one chart you can unfold and it's simple and it's readable and it will help you, and we have a copy for you if you'll write to us today.
[time=998] Rick, this is a book that every Christian should have, and we encourage you to write today to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1010] Once again, that address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1016] 46815.
[time=1018] Thank you, Pete, and we do hope that you'll write for the booklet, and we would love to hear from each of you so that we could know how God is using this ministry in your life.
[time=1029] If you're watching today for the first time or whether you are regular viewer of the Bible Hour, it would be such a significant help to us to know that you're there and that you're watching and to have your feedback on what parts of the ministry are most meaningful to you.
[time=1044] So we do hope that you'll write.
[time=1046] We have written to many of you and we've shared with you our future.
[time=1050] Next Sunday, we'll be giving you some video to look at of our new building, and we're in the process right now of asking for help and meeting a need for new equipment.
[time=1060] So if you have received a letter from us, we would love for you to pray about that and to follow the Lord's leading in your life.
[time=1067] Once again, we'd like you to write to us at the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and our zip code is 46815.
[time=1078] Thank you and God bless you.
[time=1080] Sometimes things like Harker should start a little bit ahead of time
[time=1105] and so we're just going to say if you'll pause directly right now.
[time=1108] We'll back that up, Tony, and we'll start all over again.
[time=1110] Thank you very much.
[time=1111] That was a good introduction.
[time=1113] You'll hear it again right now.
[time=1135] If I could just hold out until tomorrow,
[time=1151] if I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, I know the Lord is going to bring a better day.
[time=1163] Well, the trouble and the sorrow are a common way, the darkness hanging over hides the light of the day.
[time=1169] Heartaches are piling up about sky high, and I'm wondering if it ain't my time to die.
[time=1176] If I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, I know the Lord is going to bring a better day, better day.
[time=1192] Well, the Lord told Moses, take a hold on my hand, and guide my children to the promised land.
[time=1198] And when he spoke of from the burning bush, he said, Moses, I'm a leading out, don't you push?
[time=1205] If I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, I know the Lord is going to bring a better day, better day.
[time=1221] Well, the Lord took Jonah to the briny deep, he drifted to the bottom where the whale didn't sleep, then Jonah said, Lordy, Lordy, I've had enough, three days and nights, and then the whale spit him up.
[time=1234] If I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, I know the Lord is going to bring a better day, better day.
[time=1251] Well, they put on Daniel if the lion is dead.
[time=1255] The thing they didn't know, old Dan had a friend.
[time=1258] Well, he prayed every morning, every new tonight.
[time=1261] The lion's got the lock jaw and couldn't take a while.
[time=1266] If I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, if I could just hold out until tomorrow, I know the Lord is going to bring a better day, oh, I know the Lord is going to bring a better day.
[time=1283] Oh, I know the Lord is going to bring a better day.
[time=1290] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1300] [MUSIC] They say that heaven's pretty [MUSIC] And live in here is too [MUSIC] But if they said that I would have to choose [MUSIC] Between the two I'd go [MUSIC] Going home [MUSIC] Where I belong [MUSIC]
[time=1355] [MUSIC - 175 seconds]
[time=1533] God today we thank you for the joy of a song that would give us confidence to trust you that if I can just hold on until tomorrow.
[time=1542] God as we meet today many of us meet with confidence in the face of adversity but some would be weary and we ask for your strength and your support, your encouragement to their hearts.
[time=1554] We pray for businessmen who have been misunderstood, perhaps falsely accused and they have suffered financially.
[time=1563] We pray today that you would give them the faith and the strength to hold on until tomorrow and give to them the provision for this day.
[time=1572] God we pray for those whose health is chronically, chronically failing,
[time=1578] that you would give them the strength to hold on until tomorrow.
[time=1583] Yet God we also want to thank you for days of joy.
[time=1587] We want to thank you for blessing.
[time=1589] Today we come to this place rich, abundant in all that we have in Christ Jesus.
[time=1598] We thank you for an excess of mercy, an outpouring of grace, love beyond all measure.
[time=1606] God we thank you today.
[time=1608] We pray today for those who are battling serious battles for the Marisis as Sherry is having difficulty with this pregnancy
[time=1619] and we pray your protection upon the child and her womb.
[time=1622] We pray for Jeff Popwell as he battles Crohn's disease and the same for Bill and for George's son.
[time=1630] God we pray today for those who are holding in their hearts deep hurts that they cannot name or mention.
[time=1639] We pray for David in the hospital that you would give soundness to his spirit and to his heart.
[time=1645] God today we want to thank you for in Jesus Christ the fact that we have blessed assurance.
[time=1653] [AMEN] A blind lady saw a spiritual truth and penned these words.
[time=1664] Blessed assurance.
[time=1667] Jesus is mine.
[time=1669] All what a foretaste of glory divine.
[time=1674] Air of salvation.
[time=1676] Purchase of God.
[time=1678] Born of his spirit.
[time=1681] Washed in his blood.
[time=1684] This is my story.
[time=1686] This is my song.
[time=1688] Praising my Savior all the day long.
[time=1693] As believers in Christ there are two promises that Jesus Christ has given to us.
[time=1699] One is found in Revelation 3 20 where Jesus said behold I stand at the door and knock.
[time=1706] And if anyone hears my voice and will open the door Christ's first promise I will come in.
[time=1715] Then in Hebrews 13 5 he said I will never leave you nor forsake you.
[time=1722] The first promise I will come in.
[time=1725] The second promise I will not leave.
[time=1730] Think about that today Jesus Christ has promised to every believer that he will come into our heart
[time=1736] and that once he comes into our heart he will not leave.
[time=1740] In theological terms we draw from those promises two beliefs.
[time=1746] One the doctrine of assurance the second the doctrine of eternal security.
[time=1753] What's the difference between the two?
[time=1755] I asked that question to you in a small group in evangelism class and the great answer came out of that class.
[time=1762] Assurance is knowing you have it eternal security is knowing you'll never lose it.
[time=1769] If you have your Bible today open it to the book of Jude and as we're studying through this short powerful
[time=1775] epistle it teaches us those two truths that you can know for sure you have it and you can know for sure
[time=1783] you'll never lose it.
[time=1785] Jude is the next to last book of the Bible.
[time=1788] The last book the book of Revelation a lengthy book of 22 chapters is preceded by a very short book
[time=1796] the book of Jude only 24 verses.
[time=1800] I'm going to read for us Jude chapter well there's only one chapter so it will be Jude chapter one
[time=1807] verses one two three and four it begins.
[time=1811] Jude a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James to those who have been called who are loved by God the Father
[time=1822] and kept by Jesus Christ.
[time=1826] Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
[time=1833] Dear brothers although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share
[time=1840] I felt I had to write to urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints
[time=1850] for certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you.
[time=1860] They are godless men who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ
[time=1872] our only sovereign and Lord.
[time=1877] Well for those of you who are with us last week we started the book of Jude and I mentioned to you in his literary style he uses triads or series of threes and in the first two verses we have an introduction
[time=1891] and it is broken down into three parts.
[time=1895] The identification of the author the identification of the writer Jude a second identification the
[time=1903] recipients and thirdly a greeting.
[time=1906] Under the identification the author he gives three descriptions a name Jude secondly a servant of Jesus
[time=1914] thirdly a brother of James.
[time=1916] This morning we come to that second part of his introduction the recipients and lo and behold under the
[time=1923] recipients there are three descriptions.
[time=1926] If you'll notice he says to those who have been one called two who are loved by God the father
[time=1937] and three kept called loved and kept.
[time=1943] Today as we study Jude we're primarily looking at three descriptions that God has for us as
[time=1950] believers in Christ.
[time=1952] He says to those who have been called who are loved by God the father and kept by Jesus Christ.
[time=1960] Those of us who are called that word called speaks of the initiative of God in salvation that he actually
[time=1969] calls us that we because of our own sinfulness we do not take the initiative and we do not search
[time=1976] for God the Bible says there is none righteous no not one there's none that understands there's
[time=1985] none that seek God hang on to that last phrase there is none that seek God.
[time=1992] God seeks us he calls us to himself.
[time=1997] Here Jude is saying that you have been called by God he took the initiative when we because of our own
[time=2003] sin would never take the initiative to find God he finds us and he calls us.
[time=2010] The Bible says in the most lengthy description I know of of God's calling Ephesians 1 that
[time=2016] God called us before he created the world Ephesians 1 4 says just as we were called in him before
[time=2026] the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless.
[time=2030] So before God ever created this physical globe before God ever created life before you were ever
[time=2036] born God said I'm going to call that one but please don't think that God looked through this
[time=2042] time tunnel and he looked into the future and he said oh that's a nice guy all call that one
[time=2048] he deserves to be called and he looked down that times when he said ah that guy there he's a creep
[time=2055] I'm not going to call him. God did look in his time tunnel and the Lord he saw he said yeah I see
[time=2061] him all they're all creeps we're all sinners there is many of us that God said that one I'm going to call
[time=2068] because he's such a nice guy or she's such a sweet one all call her God said we're all unworthy
[time=2074] and that his call is not based upon merit it's based totally on his purpose and his grace.
[time=2080] Here's what Paul wrote to Timothy 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 9.
[time=2086] God who has saved us and our word called us to be a holy body not because of anything we have done
[time=2095] but because of his own purpose and his grace. God calls us totally and freely out of grace.
[time=2104] Find historian who I don't always agree with theologically but historically there may be none finer
[time=2110] than William Barkley. Barkley says this word for call was used in Greek literature for several
[time=2117] different purposes I hate to tell you this but three. He said first of all this word is used to
[time=2125] speak of someone who is called by the courts. Perhaps you have been called and you've been summons
[time=2133] the court yourself you received that statement of official notice you've been called to the court
[time=2139] to give testimony you've been summons the court or maybe you've been called to do jury duty but
[time=2145] the whole system of the courts they have called you and you must report that's how this word call was used.
[time=2152] It's interesting to note that as believers we have been called by a judicial system that in second
[time=2158] Corinthians the fifth chapter it says that we will stand before the judgment seat of Christ to give
[time=2165] account of what we've done in our life for Christ. Our sins are forgiven they're behind us they're
[time=2171] washed but what have we done for Christ only one life will soon be passed only what's done for
[time=2178] Christ will last we have become summons called to stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=2187] He says secondly this word call is often used to describe an invitation to a banquet or a celebration
[time=2194] perhaps you've been invited to a wedding and on the outside it says Mr. and Mrs. so and so and
[time=2200] Mr. and Mrs. so and so wish to invite you to their son and their daughter's wedding you're invited
[time=2206] an invitation to a celebration and to a banquet number of weeks ago we got an invitation that read like this
[time=2215] Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and his wife are hosting a banquet in Washington DC on such and
[time=2224] such a date you open it up and it said but you ain't invited to that instead you're invited to
[time=2230] the home builders scavenge your hunt that was a summons there you know all of the tenant Oliver North you ain't invited you know but there's something you are invited to you didn't get your
[time=2242] invitation you as a believer in Christ are invited to the marriage feast of the lamb you see the
[time=2252] Bible says that Jesus is the bridegroom and he is waiting for the bride to arrive who's the
[time=2260] bride we are as believers in Christ we are as bride he is the bridegroom and in heaven he's
[time=2267] waiting for the union of the bride in the bridegroom to take place and he's got a banquet that is spread and in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 it tells us in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we could
[time=2281] be ushered from this physical world into the very presence of Christ first Thessalonians says that
[time=2287] they'll come a trumpet the shout of the voice of the Archangel Michael and the dead in Christ shall
[time=2294] rise and then we who are alive as believers and remain will be caught up together with them in the
[time=2300] air and so shall we ever be with the Lord we're going to go right into his presence and he's going to have a banquet and you're invited you may not have been invited by the White House you may not
[time=2313] have been invited by a political dignity but you have been invited and called to the marriage feast
[time=2320] of the lamb and you won't want to miss that Jesus Christ when he calls us calls us in the partnership
[time=2330] with him and to the feast of the lamb there's a third use of this verse it is someone who has been
[time=2336] called into duty our service in 1972 I received a letter from our government it began with the
[time=2345] short salutation greetings you have been selected I was looking for some scholarship award that
[time=2354] would follow indeed there was a scholarship to boot camp and said you have been selected and
[time=2360] unlike most invitations it didn't say you are invited it said you will report to the federal
[time=2367] building in Cleveland Ohio that's what this word means it means someone who has been summoned to
[time=2373] duty you know as believers in Christ we have been summons to duty many of you know Romans 8 28 it
[time=2380] is a great verse of comfort for all things work together for good to those who love God and who
[time=2387] are the called according to his purpose we use that verse in the face of adversity to remind
[time=2393] ourselves trust God he is in control and that's good use of that but read on to those who are
[time=2400] called according to his purpose for those he called he predestinated that they should be
[time=2407] conformed to the image of his son ten years ago Kansas sang a song and it said dust in the wind
[time=2417] all we are is dust in the wind we are dirt that has come to life and will die and return to dust
[time=2423] it will blow away and life is nothing more than biology and hopeless hopeless determinism
[time=2429] God said I have created you and I have called you with a purpose and God's purpose for our
[time=2437] lives is that we are conformed to the image of his son you today may say I've lost my job
[time=2445] and I've lost my purpose in life some of you have lost your partner and with that death of that
[time=2451] loved one you've you've sunk down to purposelessness but your purpose in life is not to make money
[time=2459] it's not to cook meals yes those are functions that give some meaning to life but life's meaning
[time=2465] is in knowing Christ and serving him and being conformed to his image the apostle Paul said like
[time=2472] a runner he said I don't look back I forget what's behind me and I press forward and I strive
[time=2481] agonize and I press on to the high calling of God the mark which is Christ Jesus that's our
[time=2490] purpose that's what he's called us to and you have been called to follow Christ and to conform
[time=2497] your life to his image Paul was contemplating going from Ephesus to Jerusalem it was certainly
[time=2506] a threatening situation one that could pose death the Ephesian elders plead with him not
[time=2513] to go here's what Paul said in Acts 2024 I count my life as though it were nothing that I might finish
[time=2528] the race that God has set before me and complete the task he has given me the task of giving testimony
[time=2536] to the gospel of the grace of God Paul said my life it has singleness of purpose this one thing
[time=2545] I do that's the calling for the church that's not just the calling for the apostle Paul God has
[time=2552] called us that this one thing I do I conform my image to the image of Christ and I give testimony
[time=2561] in my body to the grace of God God calls us today he calls us first to salvation have you heard the
[time=2571] call of God if you've never opened up your heart to Christ this morning when we sing a hymn of invitation may it be not the words of a song leader not the voices of a congregation around you
[time=2582] that you hear but may you hear the very spirit of God speaking your ear as he calls you and if he
[time=2589] has already called you you've received Christ he's called you to walk in the conformity of the image
[time=2595] of his son we are called secondly were described not only as those who are called but those who are
[time=2604] loved by God God loves us there was a theologian I had narrowed it down to it was either a man by
[time=2616] the name of Paul Tillich or a man by the name of Karl Barth and at the end of the last hour two people
[time=2622] came to tell me it was Karl Barth Barth was a great theologian at the turn of this century and
[time=2629] lived well into the 1900s Barth had written volumes he had written deep deep theological things that
[time=2637] many of his contemporaries misunderstood many of the things that he was studying others would not
[time=2643] comprehend but he had written much and at the end of his life Barth was asked of all you've studied
[time=2650] and all that you know what's the most profound truth that you know and Barth said the most
[time=2657] profound truth I know is this one Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so
[time=2668] beloved you may be here today and you may have got lost in that whole concept of calling you may not
[time=2674] know what it means that God had decrees and before he created the world they decreed that you would come to Christ Jesus that may be deep stuff that you don't understand but can you understand
[time=2685] this God loves you there's no truth more profound there's no reality more certain there's nothing
[time=2693] the theologians can dig down and pull up to the surface that is more real than this God loves you
[time=2701] and you can have that confidence because the scripture says so he really loves you he doesn't
[time=2709] love you if you do the right things and he doesn't love you because you're good he loves you in spite
[time=2718] of the fact that we don't live up to as ifs or as because he loves you don't ever lose sight of
[time=2728] that and all the study of scripture the profound truth is this that you are loved of God he loves
[time=2737] you today you know his love is not based upon performance so many today feel like yes my parents
[time=2745] love me but they love me if or they love me because and you take away them because you let me
[time=2753] fail at the ifs and they don't love me many husbands today many wives today feel like their marriage
[time=2762] hinges on a list of contingencies if if if if then but there's one that loves you unconditionally
[time=2772] this morning Jesus Christ stick your bulletin here in Jude and turn to Romans chapter five that
[time=2781] you can rejoice in the depth of the love of God his unconditional love Romans chapter five verse
[time=2789] six we find yes three descriptions of us Romans five verse six it says you see at just the right
[time=2800] time when we were still powerless Christ died for note this the ungodly very rarely will anyone die
[time=2810] for a righteous man though for a good man someone may possibly dare to die but God demonstrates his
[time=2819] love for us in this while we were still secondly sinners Christ died for us since we have been
[time=2830] justified by his blood how much more shall we be safe from God's wrath through him for if when we
[time=2836] were God's third description enemies while we were God's enemies we were reconciled to him through
[time=2846] the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life
[time=2852] does God say I love you because you're special do I love you because you are better than somebody
[time=2858] else no God says I love you even though you are ungodly even though you are sinners even though
[time=2864] you're my enemies my love is unconditional you are loved of God third description in this introduction
[time=2873] who are the kept by Jesus Christ you're called we are loved we are kept now just so you don't get
[time=2882] bored with threes I've got five things I want to tell you about this keeping first of all the word
[time=2888] keep means to hold secure it has in the concept of something that's given and it's entrusted like a
[time=2895] man who takes what is precious and he puts it into a safety deposit box and it's there for safe
[time=2901] keeping the Apostle Paul said I know whom I have believe it and I am persuaded that he is able to
[time=2909] keep that which I've committed unto him against that day that's what the word keep means it means
[time=2916] to be secured but the second thing that this word keep has for us to know today is this God keeps
[time=2925] us we don't keep ourselves it says we are kept by Jesus Christ yes the day I asked Christ in my
[time=2934] heart we entered in a partnership and God made his hand available to me and I took that hand and
[time=2940] we formed a partnership but I am not kept because of what a good grip I've got on God I'm kept
[time=2948] because he keeps me Aaron would you help me out this morning he's embarrassed Aaron Geiger just
[time=2954] died here in the front row Aaron do you have an imagination sure you do Aaron would you take my hand now you imagine for a moment that I'm God okay and now you're Aaron and we just joined into that eternal partnership now Aaron you let go go ahead and let go well let go Aaron you can't do
[time=2971] that can you next year you can jerk my arm off but this year I can still hold on to that's what happens I can't hold on to God my grip is weak if my eternal security was saying God threw out a
[time=2984] line and I grabbed hold of it and here I hang till the day of redemption I'm in trouble but God
[time=2990] didn't throw out a line he threw out a hand and his hand is so strong that he says I will never
[time=2997] let go of you somebody in advertising knew John chapter 10 and they sold it to all states I hope
[time=3005] God got a royalty because in John chapter 10 Jesus said my father's hands are stronger than anyone
[time=3014] else and I have positioned you in my father's hand and no one can take you out you're in good hands
[time=3022] with God eternal security is not based upon me it is not based upon you if it were we are
[time=3032] eternally insecure but because it's based upon Jesus Christ and he does the keeping it's eternally
[time=3041] secure before Jude could ever teach a body of people about the dangers of apostasy and that there are
[time=3048] false professors who do not truly possess Christ and they will fall away he first had to teach him
[time=3056] that they are kept ones yes there'll be those in the assembly who will fall away but you were in Christ you are kept ones and before he can end that epistle he has to tell him again you are kept
[time=3067] ones Jude chapter 24 now unto him who is able to keep you from falling not now unto you who better
[time=3076] keep yourselves from falling but unto him who can keep you from falling it is God who keeps us third observation about keeping is this how well does God keep us well look at Jude 24
[time=3090] Jude 1 doesn't give us that but Jude 24 does to him who was able to keep you from falling
[time=3096] and to present you before his glorious presence notice this little prepositional phrase without
[time=3105] fault how well does God keep you he keeps you faultless God doesn't say I stick you into this
[time=3114] security deposit box I lock the door I let you waller in your own sin and mire and then I come
[time=3120] on lock and say good grief that's what I've kept no God says I keep you faultless
[time=3127] I keep you blameless I keep you spotless are you blameless no am I faultless no
[time=3135] but God keeps me that way you see there is in heaven a real courtroom and God is a real judge
[time=3144] and there is a real prosecuting attorney called Satan and every time we sin God is sitting on his
[time=3151] throne and Satan says God I accuse hawks God I accuse this one God I saw that one and I file charges
[time=3160] there's not only a judge in the prosecuting attorney there's an advocate there's a defense
[time=3166] attorney Jesus Christ the righteous my little children john writes in first john chapter two
[time=3173] these things right I unto you that you sin not but if any man sin we have an advocate with the father
[time=3180] Jesus Christ the righteous and in Hebrew 725 it says he is always interceding in behalf of the
[time=3187] saints yes my life is covered with sin Satan comes as the accuser of the brethren and Jesus
[time=3193] stands up and says I died for that sin it has not only been paid for it has been washed and he is
[time=3199] now faultless that's how well God keeps us fourth observation how long does he keep us
[time=3211] now unto him who is able to keep you from falling
[time=3217] and present you faultless before his throne do you know how long Christ keeps you he keeps you
[time=3227] all the way all the way first Peter chapter one verse five now unto him who is able to keep you
[time=3238] that's Jude first Peter says that we are kept by the power of God unto the day of redemption
[time=3244] Philippians 1 6 he who began a good work in you he will perform it until the day he comes again
[time=3251] how long will God keep you he'll keep you all the way from the day you receive him to the day he
[time=3257] ushers you into his presence and you stand before the judgment seat of Christ he will keep you that long how well will he keep you he will keep you faultless till you come before his throne
[time=3269] a fifth observation a word of warning some would take this as a grand permission slip
[time=3278] uh-huh if I am kept by God and I am kept blame us and I am kept eternally wow I can go do anything
[time=3288] I want and God will keep me God gives to us a responsibility not only to know that we are kept
[time=3297] but in Jude 1 he tells us he keeps us in Jude 24 he says he keeps us but look at Jude 21
[time=3307] Jude 21 keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[time=3316] with privilege comes responsibility if we love Christ if we're called by him and now we said yes
[time=3325] to his call and we love him in response how do you say God I know it costs to your son Jesus I know
[time=3332] it costs your life but I'll go take advantage of it now we keep ourselves there are some that
[time=3339] want to reject this doctrine of being kept eternally secure because they see it only as a permission
[time=3345] slip but beloved if you have a bent toward sin and you want to justify it you can do that whether
[time=3351] you believe in eternal security or not one deviant said I'm eternally secure I'll go do what I want God's obligated to keep me this deviant says God doesn't keep me I know I'm going to lose my salvation but I'll do it anyway because I'll just get resaved tomorrow you see if you're not committed
[time=3368] to following Christ you can make sin work either way the scriptures teach that God holds us eternally
[time=3379] secure but it teaches them that we are responsible to keep ourselves and to work out our own salvation
[time=3387] with fear and trembling for it is God that both works and wills in you to do according to his
[time=3393] good pleasure it is a divine cooperative it is God saying you cannot be faultless you cannot keep
[time=3401] yourself but you can strive in an adventure and you can be molded and shaped into the image of my
[time=3407] son will you attain it no but I'll keep you you keep yourself many a mother has dressed their
[time=3415] little darling on a Sunday morning and they've gotten that here all to lay down for the first time in a week and they've cleaned that face up and they've they've got that face so that a grandma
[time=3426] could kiss it and not worry about what you know they had for breakfast that day and the little clothes that they're all fitted and the shirt is tucked in and mom has done that and you know what
[time=3438] mom's gonna say now keep yourself clean till we get there Jesus said now keep yourself clean till we
[time=3446] get there but you know what happens mom gets him here and he tried he really did mom but that's
[time=3453] shirt tail just came out and that candy bar just looks so good I couldn't wait and no mom does
[time=3460] mom takes that shirt she tucks it back in she does the most despicable thing on earth mothers do
[time=3467] they take out their hanging they lick it and then they want to wipe your face with it and they wonder
[time=3474] why you reject that I never understood that but but you know it's good and they clean you up again
[time=3482] and they make you presentable again and Jesus said you keep clean but I will keep you to the end
[time=3497] and to those who are kept who are loved or called be multiplied mercy peace and love
