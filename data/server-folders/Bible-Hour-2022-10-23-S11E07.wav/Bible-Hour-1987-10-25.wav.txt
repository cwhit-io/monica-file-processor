[time=113] Some of the most frightening words that Jesus Christ ever spoke were these.
[time=119] "I never knew you." Those are the words that He has planned for those who have always thought that they were Christians because they professed with their lips,
[time=131] but they did not with their life.
[time=134] George Gallup describes American Christianity today.
[time=138] He said, "While there is a great upswing in church attendance,
[time=144] there is a corresponding downswing in ethical and moral behavior."
[time=150] It is a paradox today that while religion is growing in importance, morality is losing ground.
[time=160] To many within this church, Jesus may say, "I never knew you."
[time=168] [MUSIC]
[time=178] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=183] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=185] Rick's message today is entitled Acts of the Apostates and is taken from the Book of Jude.
[time=191] Nominal Christians, those who only profess to know Christ, but who in reality do not follow Him,
[time=197] have always been a part of the church.
[time=200] Unfortunately, many of these people actually deny Christ.
[time=204] It is possible to confess Christ with our lips and to deny Him with our life.
[time=209] That was the situation Jude faced in his church and the same situation we face in our church today.
[time=216] From Jude's writing, we can learn how to diagnose the Acts of the Apostates.
[time=222] Please locate your Bible and have it open to the Book of Jude.
[time=226] We will be looking at verses one through four.
[time=229] Our special music today includes a song from the Sanctuary Choir,
[time=235] an instrumental from Dave Johnson, and a solo from Brian Lowson.
[time=243] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=251] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=256] Now, here's Rick.
[time=259] Good morning and welcome.
[time=265] It's a joy to come into this place and to lift our voices together and say, "I just keep trusting my Lord." I hope today you know Jesus Christ is your Savior, that you can say, "He is my Lord, and I'm trusting in Him." Thank you for being a part of our second worship service this morning.
[time=285] We want to welcome you and also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=291] We've come today to claim that Jesus Christ is Lord and to declare that
[time=297] and to remind ourselves of what He's done for us, that through His death on the cross we can have eternal life, and His cross is the gateway into the Kingdom.
[time=309] [MUSIC - 266 seconds]
[time=591] The privilege of knowing Christ's Savior Keith was our faith looking heavenly to that day when we'll spend eternity with Him because indeed the price has been paid.
[time=601] My faith looks up to the Him number 425.
[time=604] I will sing the first, third and fourth stanzas together, Him number 425.
[time=610] [MUSIC] My faith looks up to the Him [MUSIC] All in all family, stay your divine [MUSIC] Now hear me while I pray [MUSIC] Stay your life, feel your way [MUSIC] Oh, let me come to save me [MUSIC] Oh, hear me from [MUSIC] Oh, let me start with your friend [MUSIC] And we'll start while we spend [MUSIC] Being on my mind [MUSIC] In the rest of the day [MUSIC] I'm sorrowed in the way [MUSIC] Oh, let me ever sing [MUSIC] On the outside [MUSIC] Earth and light are fancied free [MUSIC] When there's full start to free [MUSIC] Shallow me home [MUSIC] Let's sing of heaven come [MUSIC] Here and place fast through [MUSIC] Oh, let me sing of the [MUSIC] Oh, let us fall [MUSIC]
[time=817] [MUSIC - 100 seconds]
[time=927] â™ª It is such a privilege for us each week to put together the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=939] We literally look forward to the opportunity of coming into our church and putting together this ministry, and we trust that it's exactly that to each of you, a ministry.
[time=949] And another ministry is coming up the living Christmas tree, and Pete, this is the weekend for you where the work really starts to accelerate.
[time=957] Well, as we continue our weekend and week out responsibilities of ministry on the Bible hour and for our church,
[time=964] we do have the living Christmas tree coming up.
[time=967] Many people have signed up to help in construction work.
[time=970] We had our retreat for the music this last weekend, and things are really moving along in anticipation of our concerts that will be held in December.
[time=979] And you want to set aside Saturday November 14th for public distribution of tickets.
[time=985] That begins at nine o'clock right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church, and you can come here and get as many as eight tickets, Rick, on just showing up, and then that will assure you of getting the date that you want if you come on November 14th.
[time=1000] Please do plan on coming and getting your tickets.
[time=1003] We cannot mail them to you, so we must ask you not to write and request tickets, although we'd love to have you write for a pamphlet we're going to share with you in a moment or for other purposes.
[time=1014] But with the living Christmas tree tickets, we just cannot handle the volumes of mail in a timely way.
[time=1019] But on November 14th, you can come and pick up your tickets, and at that same time, you can look straight across the street and see our new building as it is well under construction.
[time=1030] In fact, we have a videotape of the construction of our new sanctuary that we would like to share with you right now.
[time=1037] So thanks to our television crew, we can now play for you our new building under construction.
[time=1042] These two men you see here, the one furthest behind Henry is a solid believer for Christ, and he's a joy to be around on the job site.
[time=1050] That big piece of steel that you saw going up is the balcony for the second floor of the auditorium.
[time=1057] This is what you would see if you were standing in our present parking lot and looking across the street, you'd be looking from north to south, and that would be the face of the building you would see.
[time=1067] Now, to television, people like us, this is really important.
[time=1071] That's the new control room for the Bible hour underway.
[time=1075] That man in the Brown Jacket, Dale Harder, is the project coordinator, and we'd ask you to pray for Dale.
[time=1081] He's had some heart trouble, he's a fine man, and we've certainly missed him on the site this week.
[time=1086] And here's the new parking lot that we're parking on today, and that is certainly good news for all of us
[time=1092] who've had some overcrowded parking conditions. Inside a hallway gives you some of the length and depth of the building.
[time=1099] It's a rather large structure. It's hard for us to believe it.
[time=1102] The sanctuary alone has more square feet than all of the present buildings were in here on North State Street.
[time=1108] And as you look from the back of the building, through the new building, you can see our present home, the white in the background.
[time=1116] Pete, this is your home and the future. That back extension is the choir room. Doesn't look like they're ready for you just yet though.
[time=1123] We're looking forward to that close proximity to the sanctuary. It's built very similar to the choir loft.
[time=1129] So as we prepare during the weekend on Sunday mornings, we'll be set for our ministry.
[time=1134] Well, we're looking forward to having the first Sunday service there, probably sometime next August.
[time=1140] So you can be praying with us as we are endeavoring to build an auditorium that will service the needs of our church
[time=1147] and also to service the needs of the Bible hour. Our church people have given generously and sacrificially
[time=1153] and they've provided literally tens of thousands of dollars that go into the ministry of the Bible hour
[time=1159] and yet we still have a great need for new television equipment.
[time=1163] So if you did receive a letter from us about that need, we hope you'll prayerfully consider that and we'll be anxious to hear from you.
[time=1169] For each of you who would write today, we have an exciting pamphlet called the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air.
[time=1176] You may be aware of the fact that we are talking about apostasy in our Sunday morning services.
[time=1182] This particular pamphlet gives you what God's word, the Spirit of Truth says, on seven key Bible doctrines,
[time=1189] particularly what the Bible says about God, about Jesus Christ and about salvation.
[time=1195] It compares what the Bible says with a number of old cults we would call those
[time=1201] and a number of the new cults such as the unification church, you might know them as the moonies
[time=1207] and various groups that have taken an element of the scripture and they've completely twisted it.
[time=1213] From time to time people say, "Well aren't those people that you call cults really just another form of believers?"
[time=1219] Well I wish that I could say they were but not when somebody like Reverend Moon says that he is Jesus Christ come back again
[time=1226] that he is the Lord of the Second Advent.
[time=1229] I'm afraid they are not believers in Christ and we need to know the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air.
[time=1235] So if you'll write to us today, we'll send you this excellent pamphlet put together by Moody Bible Institute if you'll simply ask for it today.
[time=1243] You can receive this helpful booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1254] Just ask for the pamphlet Spirit of Truth and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1266] Thank you Pete and thank you for joining us today and we would love to hear from you and of course send you that pamphlet should you request it
[time=1273] but just a note of encouragement or insight as to how God has used this ministry of the Bible Hour in your life would be a great help to us.
[time=1281] So we do hope you'll write today. Thank you.
[time=1296] It was for you. The Savior died. For you His precious blood flowed from His side. It was for you.
[time=1322] The Savior died. His strong and loving arms are opened wide. He paid the price 2,000 years ago.
[time=1350] And now He promises to wash you White as snow. It was for you. The Savior died.
[time=1374] It was for you, my friend, for you.
[time=1390] It was for you. He gave His all. In love He rescued you from Adam's fall.
[time=1412] It was for you. He gave His all.
[time=1424] Oh, won't you hear and hear His loving call? He offers you a perfect hiding place.
[time=1446] He warmly urges you to receive His gift of grace. It was for you.
[time=1465] He gave His all. It was for you, my friend.
[time=1478] For you. For you.
[time=1496] Thank you, Brian. Would you bow that we might pray together and thank the Lord for what He has done for us?
[time=1504] God, we bow today because we are our God and we have come to praise you and we cannot even comprehend and fool either how great you are or how much you have done for us.
[time=1521] But we've come today to worship you and to praise you and to say from the death of our heart that we recognize that you are God and that we need you every hour.
[time=1534] Father, we pray today for those who are going through a tough hour in their life.
[time=1539] Leaders in our community are in business who are facing difficult decisions. We've been misunderstood. God may they find you there, meeting their need for support.
[time=1553] We pray for those who in their hour of health need you today for strength.
[time=1559] So we pray for Eleanor Layman and Jack Nisonger. We pray today for Joyce Lee, Marv Daggetz. God today that you would be by their side.
[time=1573] Most of all today we would pray for Alan Miller and the tragic death of his father in a car accident.
[time=1579] And for his mother as she is critically injured in a hospital. Oh God, as we meet today we sense that we need you. Some need physical help, others need wisdom.
[time=1592] Each of us needs to know of your grace and forgiveness. We've come today to say God, we need thee every hour. We need thee, our God.
[time=1609] We need thee, our God.
[time=1694] Thank you, David, with beauty on the string instrument, but also of song that says I need thee every hour.
[time=1718] It's hard for us as Americans. We've been raised as Mark Twain put it with a determined spirit of self-reliance. So it becomes difficult to come to say God, I need you.
[time=1729] I recognize that I am not totally adequate in life. I cannot meet every challenge. I need thee every hour.
[time=1738] I hope today that you sense not only that you have spiritual need, but there is a God who is anxious to assist you, who is available to you every hour.
[time=1750] Well, if you have your Bible today, we're studying through the book of Jude. For those of you who are new to Bible study, the book of Jude is the next to last book in the Bible.
[time=1759] Somebody said not in my Bible, the last book in my Bible is the book of maps. Well, in the back of some Bibles, there are some maps, but that's not a part of the inspired text.
[time=1769] The last book is the book of Revelation, 22 chapters long. It's a pretty lengthy book. And then just prior to that last book of Revelation, there is a book of Jude that is just one chapter long.
[time=1783] So if you have one of those different Bibles, it goes maps, Revelation, Jude, but Jude is the next to last book in the Bible.
[time=1792] And we're studying it not only to understand what was said then, but to know what God wants us to do now.
[time=1799] So I'd like to read for us Jude chapter 1 verses 1 through 4. Jude, a servant of Jesus and a brother of James to those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ.
[time=1820] Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
[time=1848] For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you, they are godless men who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only sovereign and Lord.
[time=1874] There is a name very, very familiar in our country with polls and surveys. It is the name of George Gallup.
[time=1882] And in the recent poll, George Gallup did a survey and an inventory on America's spiritual condition.
[time=1889] There were a number of things that were said that were encouraging, but the bottom line has to be of great concern.
[time=1896] In the Gallup survey, it said that religion and religious interest is up. Eight out of ten people who report themselves to be Christians say that daily Bible reading is an important part of their life.
[time=1910] Yet at the same time, while 80% of Christians say they find Bible reading very important, four of those said they had no idea who gave the sermon on the mount.
[time=1920] It was Jesus in case you're in that group. So somehow there's a gap between what we say we're doing and what we're actually learning and believing.
[time=1931] But there's another gap that is more than just a cognitive gap, it is a behavioral gap.
[time=1937] At the end of his survey, George Gallup shares these words of concern. He says little difference is found in the ethical views and behavior of those who go to church and those who do not when it comes to honesty, cheating, lying, and pilferage.
[time=1962] The nation is faced with this paradox, says Gallup. Religion is growing in importance, but morality is losing ground.
[time=1976] Well, that's a description of Christianity today in the United States. It's not the emotional description of a pastor of a church who has decided today is going to scold the people.
[time=1988] It's not the impression of an evangelist who is going around trying to wring alarm bells. It's simply an analytical survey that is done by the people who come to it with great objectivity.
[time=2002] And the conclusion is there is a great gap between what we say and believe and how we really live and think.
[time=2013] In a word it is called apostasy. That is a big word. We'll describe it in detail today.
[time=2021] In Jude chapter 1 verses 3 and 4, he gives us the purpose for his writing. You know, when you get a letter, sometimes you read that letter and you get lost in the paragraphs and in the shuffle, and you really don't even know why these people are writing to you.
[time=2037] Jude says right up front, "Here's why I'm writing to you." He gives us his purpose. First, he gives us the occasion and then the issue.
[time=2045] By the occasion, first of all, he had an original desire to write. He said, "Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the common salvation we share, that was here as original occasion, he said, "I felt I had to write to you and urge you to contend for the faith."
[time=2065] That's the urgent one. Basically, what he's saying is, "I was going to write your letter." It's like most of us say, "Oh, I'm glad to see you. I've been meaning to call you. I meant to write to you why you were gone."
[time=2078] You've got caught in that situation a few times. "I meant to write to you. I meant to give you a call. I wanted to do that."
[time=2085] Jude says, "I've been meaning to write to you. I wanted to." He really cares about these people. He calls them dear friends. It's actually a form of that famous Greek word agape, which means to love deeply. He says, "I really love you, and I wanted to write to you, and I just wanted to talk on general terms of encouragement about the common faith that we have."
[time=2109] He says, "That's what I really wanted to do. Just to encourage you. That's in many ways the spirit of the hymn writer who said, "I love to tell the story to those that know it best."
[time=2119] Even though they know it best, they seem hungry and thirsty to hear it like the rest. There's something special about a group of believers when we come together and we really talk about the Lord.
[time=2130] Jude said, "I wanted to write to you and just talk about the Lord and the faith that we share. However, an urgency came up."
[time=2140] Now, I'm encouraged by Jude's urgency. It's refreshing to read a letter where there's something urgent and it's not an appeal for money.
[time=2149] One time in my life, and only once have I gotten one of those really fancy letters, the ones that absolutely positively must be there overnight, expressed delivery, urgent, was stamped across the front of it.
[time=2164] Somebody spent $9.85 to get me an urgent letter. I tucked that under my arm so that it would conspicuously hang out, so everybody in the building knew that I was important, that I got an urgent letter.
[time=2176] And I walked in my office and opened it up, and the bottom line was basically, "Send money." That's what urgency is in our culture today. Jude said there's something urgent, but he's not trying to get into their bill fold.
[time=2188] He said there's an urgent need in this primarily spiritual. He said, "I had to write to you to ask you to urge you to come alongside and stand by your side and to say, 'contend for the faith.'"
[time=2205] Now, that word "contend." I have to confess to you as one of my favorite words in the Bible.
[time=2210] If you took each of the Greek letters and you changed them into English letters, you would come out with a word called agony.
[time=2217] It's pronounced in Greek, agonidzo, and we get from it agonize. It had two primarily uses it.
[time=2225] It was used often of the athlete, and it's used in the scripture of the athlete like in running the race.
[time=2231] Are you aware of the story of the Battle of Marathon? The Persians had invaded Greece,
[time=2237] and they were ready to come from the north and come down and to crush the capital of Athens.
[time=2243] But Spartan soldiers went and they stood across the narrow strait of Marathon.
[time=2250] And 300 Spartans turned back thousands of Persians, and they held back the Persians until Athens could be prepared.
[time=2258] But Athens was sitting in fear, and so one man was asked to run from Marathon to Athens,
[time=2264] and he ran, and he ran, and he ran, and he agonized, and he got there, and he shouted out one word,
[time=2273] '90, victory, and he collapsed. That's what this word agonize means.
[time=2281] It means that athlete who runs in the words of Howard Cosel with reckless abandonment self is denied and given exclusively to that cause.
[time=2291] But it also has a military sense, not just that athlete, but that soldier.
[time=2296] Paul said that Timothy, fight the good fight. There is a battle, and we are to agonize in battle.
[time=2305] There is a Greek historian by the name of Herodotus, and Herodotus said of this word agonize,
[time=2311] that it means to battle for life or for death.
[time=2319] Jude said, I wanted to write you this calm, friendly little letter, just a word of encouragement,
[time=2326] but I felt I had to tell you to agonize, to enter the battle, and to contend for the faith.
[time=2337] Now he uses that word "faith" as a noun.
[time=2341] If you are an English student, you may know that the word "faith" is both a noun and a verb.
[time=2347] Faith refers to an action of believing. I have faith in you. I trust you. I believe you.
[time=2357] It's also a noun. It is something that we believe.
[time=2362] It is a statement that we say yes. That is the faith.
[time=2369] And the faith was under attack.
[time=2374] There were, and we'll look at this at false teachers who had come into that church and who were taking the faith, and they were altering it, they were twisting it, and ultimately, absolutely replacing it. And he said that they were to contend for it.
[time=2392] They were to fight for it.
[time=2395] Now let me just put one thing in balance.
[time=2398] While the Bible tells us, me and you, that we are to contend for the faith,
[time=2404] it also tells us we're not to be contentious in spirit.
[time=2409] There are a whole group of people who really are contending for the faith, but they're contentious people, and they will gain no ground for the cause of Christ because of their spirit. And it's paradoxical, even antithetical, but the Scripture says here, contend for the faith, and then in 2 Timothy 2, it says, "And the servant of Christ must not be contentious." There's an old writer by the name of chambers who said, "We interpret the deity by the hard and impervious scowl, which sits on the countenance of the angry theologian, and in the strife and clamor of their fierce animosities." Now many people today think the meaner the preacher is, the closer to the truth he stands. Not so.
[time=2459] You can contend for the faith and be gracious.
[time=2463] Condescending looks do not go with clear theology.
[time=2467] We are to contend, but at the same time not to be contentious in fighting for the faith.
[time=2475] Now this word "faith" has a rather significant description.
[time=2479] It says, "The faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints."
[time=2487] Now by entrusted to the saints, it meant it was given over like a deposit.
[time=2492] When you go into the bank, you take your money or your check, and you deliver it over to them, you entrust them, and they are now the keepers of your funds.
[time=2503] God says, "The faith has been taken, and it has been entrusted.
[time=2508] It's been delivered over to us for our guarding, our keeping,
[time=2514] and we are to contend for that faith." But the most significant description is, "It's faith that has been once and for all entrusted." Now that word "once" and then the phrase "and for all" is actually being pulled out of one word "hopox." But let me tell you the meaning of that word.
[time=2533] The word "once" "hopox" means something that can happen once, that did happen once, that has implications into the future, and it will not happen again.
[time=2545] Let me give you two other uses of it, and I think you'll get the picture.
[time=2548] In Hebrews, chapter 9, verse 22, it says, "It is appointed unto man once to die, and then the judgment.
[time=2557] It is not something that you can do as a repeated experience.
[time=2560] You may say, "Oh, I love the jog.
[time=2562] I think I'll do it once, twice.
[time=2564] Maybe I'll do it every day this week." You cannot say, "You know, I'm kind of tired of life.
[time=2569] I think I'll die, and if I don't like death, well, I'll just -- I'll choose life again." It's a one-time act, and when it happens, it's done for.
[time=2579] Same thing's true of 1 Peter, chapter 3, verse 18.
[time=2583] It says that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins once and for all.
[time=2589] He is not going to come and die on the cross for us again.
[time=2593] It is once.
[time=2594] It is for all.
[time=2595] It is settled.
[time=2596] It is finished.
[time=2597] Now, some of you are saying, "Okay, what's the big point to that?" This is not implication.
[time=2603] This is declaration.
[time=2605] Here the Bible is saying that God took in a period of time, and He revealed His Word to us, and it has been delivered, and He did that once, and for all, and He is no longer giving revelation.
[time=2620] So if somebody comes up to you and says, "I had a revelation from God, and God told me this, and God said that, they may have gotten an inner sense of God leading them, but God did not reveal to them new information." He doesn't do that anymore.
[time=2636] It happened once and for all.
[time=2640] And someone may come up to you and say, "Hello," and they may read you a list of credentials that they've pastored here, and they've taught here, and they've got this education, and they've got more education, and they've had this experience, and therefore they now have a message.
[time=2656] And it's different than the message of Scripture that's not real.
[time=2662] Let me give you Paul's way of saying the same thing.
[time=2665] Do you have your Bible turned to Galatians chapter 1?
[time=2668] Earlier in the New Testament, if you're not one to jump from place to place, I will read it for you.
[time=2675] But in Galatians chapter 1, the Apostle Paul said this in verse 6,
[time=2681] "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel, which is really no gospel at all.
[time=2696] Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and trying to pervert the gospel of Christ." Now note this, "But even if we," Paul includes himself, he includes the apostles, "but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preach to you, let him be eternally condemned."
[time=2724] You see, both Paul and Judah saying the same thing.
[time=2727] God has delivered his gospel, and if somebody else comes and says, "I've got a new one, or I've got the addition, I've got the update." Don't believe him.
[time=2738] Paul said, "Even if it's somebody who comes with apostolic authority, if it's a different gospel, don't believe it." So when you hear someone teach, including me, if it's different than the Scripture that was once and for all delivered, discard it immediately.
[time=2754] And if someone says, "Ha ha, it wasn't just some apostle.
[time=2758] If I got it from an angel, be doubly suspicious."
[time=2765] Because Paul said, "Even if an angel says it." You know, even though the Scripture is there and it's so clear, there are a group of people that said, "You know, our leader, Joseph Smith, was sitting in upstate New York, and an angel came to him by the name of Moroni." The angel told him where to dig, and he found these golden tablets, 12 of them, and nobody could read them until the angel told him where to find these magical spectacles, and then he read them, and we've got a new gospel.
[time=2797] Disappointingly, the angel, the tablets, and the spectacles have all disappeared, but the teaching of Joseph Smith lives on as a perversion of the gospel called Mormonism.
[time=2810] The Bible says, "God delivered it once and for all." And Jude said, "That for all was over.
[time=2814] There is no new gospel to be given." And we are to contend for that.
[time=2820] That's his occasion for writing.
[time=2822] Why did he write?
[time=2823] Originally, he won't encourage, but urgently he had to tell him to contend for the faith.
[time=2829] Why?
[time=2830] Here's the issue, verse 4.
[time=2832] For certain men.
[time=2835] Certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you.
[time=2843] They are godless men.
[time=2846] Now as he starts talking about apostasy, he tells us three things about the apostasy.
[time=2851] The first thing he tells us, it's anticipated.
[time=2855] He said, "Certain men have slipped in, and these guys, their condemnation was written about long ago." God anticipated this.
[time=2865] The fact that there are false teachers, that there are hypocrites, that there are destroyers of the truth.
[time=2870] And the church, in this church, should surprise no one.
[time=2874] They were anticipated.
[time=2876] He said, "Their condemnation was written about long ago." In the Old Testament, Jeremiah the prophet, and Jeremiah chapter 5, verses 14 and 15, it tells us about false teachers among God's flock.
[time=2890] In 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, verse 6 through 10, it tells us the coming antichrist, but it says the secret power of lawlessness is already at work.
[time=2903] You see, it's all being anticipated.
[time=2905] Nobody anticipated it more than Christ.
[time=2908] In Matthew chapter 13, he gave a series of parables.
[time=2912] Kingdom parables, we call those.
[time=2914] One of the parables was the parable of the wheat and the tares.
[time=2918] I am a city slicker.
[time=2922] I am borrowing this from the agrarian writers.
[time=2925] But I'm told that wheat and tares not only grow in the same field, but they have a great similarity in their early stages.
[time=2934] But when harvest time comes, they change different colors, and it becomes very obvious.
[time=2939] That's wheat.
[time=2940] That's a tear.
[time=2942] Jesus used that illustrate.
[time=2943] He said, "Don't go out into the fields until it's harvest." And starts saying, "I've got to get this one out, and I'll leave that one and pull this wheat.
[time=2951] No, no, I did it wrong." He said, "You'll mess it up.
[time=2955] The wheat and the tear grows side by side until the harvest comes.
[time=2960] And so in the church, there'll be wheat, true believers.
[time=2963] There'll be tears, false terrors, tears, false professors inside the church, and you can't uproot them because you can't tell one from the other." He gave the parable of the mustard seed.
[time=2975] He said, "Even though the mustard seeds are a little seed, you plant the ground, grows into this huge tree, and that tree represents the church." And guess what?
[time=2982] The birds of the air come and they light there.
[time=2985] The tree's not pure.
[time=2986] It's got impurities.
[time=2987] It's got birds.
[time=2988] And believe it or not, we've got some birds in this church.
[time=2992] Now the hawks are acceptable birds, but there are some other birds here that they don't know about.
[time=2998] The parable of the mustard seed.
[time=3000] The tree is polluted with birds.
[time=3002] He gave the parable of the net.
[time=3004] He said, "You throw out the net." You know when you pull out the net, you get some good fish and you get some other stuff.
[time=3010] And we throw out a net called the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3013] You pull it in, you get all kinds of believers, and you get some birds.
[time=3017] You get some strange fish.
[time=3020] And he said, "Anticipate it." So don't be surprised today if you discover that somebody sitting down in the row from you is totally a hypocrite.
[time=3029] They're immoral.
[time=3030] They lie.
[time=3031] They may cheat.
[time=3032] Don't let that shock you.
[time=3034] Anticipate it.
[time=3035] We throw out a pretty big net.
[time=3037] And we pull in a little bit of everything.
[time=3040] Second thing, you said not only were these people anticipated, they're condemnation written about long ago, but he's second.
[time=3047] He says, "They're artful." He said, "For they have secretly slipped in among you."
[time=3055] These guys are sharp.
[time=3057] I mean, they know the walk and the talk, and they know the right people, and they drop the right names, and they've read the right books, and they can make their message, which is a distortion, the gospel message, but they can make it sound so much like Bible, you've got to believe it.
[time=3074] They're artful.
[time=3075] They secretly slip in.
[time=3077] The word actually is a compound that means "side into enter." It means somebody who's snuck in the side door.
[time=3085] It's used of an outlaw who's been expelled from his country like a Napoleon who has banished to the island of Elba, but he comes back.
[time=3096] Someone who sneaks in, sly, artful.
[time=3102] You know, that's how the cults work today.
[time=3104] I was invited to a lunch, and the lunch was sponsored by a church, and don't worry about what name of the church is because they've got more names than there are people here today, and they keep changing the names, so the bottom line is you will not know they are the moonies.
[time=3121] And so new names are always given, and ministry titles are given, and you're invited to this lunch, and I went to this lunch.
[time=3128] And they begin to say, "How many things we hold in common?
[time=3131] Your church and our church." They begin to tell you all these things, and they had some good insights into Scripture.
[time=3139] They taught some things really well.
[time=3143] But you know what they teach?
[time=3145] They teach that Jesus Christ didn't really accomplish all God wanted him to.
[time=3149] He failed in his first mission.
[time=3150] That's why he has to come again, and he has come.
[time=3153] He's coming out of Korea, and his name's son, a young moon.
[time=3157] And so I asked at that lunch, "Do you believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God?" Yes, we do.
[time=3163] "Do you believe that he died on the cross for our sins and they got fuzzy?
[time=3168] Do you believe that that same Jesus is coming again?" We believe that he's come.
[time=3173] Who is he?
[time=3175] Son of a young moon.
[time=3177] That's a different gospel.
[time=3179] But you see, they were sharp, and they slipped in the side door, and all kinds of people listened to that.
[time=3186] That sounds Bible.
[time=3187] That sounds God-talk.
[time=3189] They name the name of Jesus.
[time=3192] They're artful.
[time=3194] Third thing he says, not only are they anticipated, not only are they artful, and I'm going to use a harsh word.
[time=3199] They're anti-Christ.
[time=3202] He describes them in three ways.
[time=3204] Now, he says, "They're godless.
[time=3206] They exchange the grace of our God for a license to sin, and they deny Jesus Christ our only sovereign and Lord."
[time=3216] Turn back third John, second John, first John, chapter four.
[time=3223] Verse one through three.
[time=3226] Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirit to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
[time=3237] This is how you can recognize the spirit of God.
[time=3241] Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
[time=3248] But every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is from God.
[time=3252] This is the spirit of the anti-Christ.
[time=3255] What you have heard is coming, and even now is already in the world.
[time=3259] Here's the test John gives.
[time=3261] He takes the name Jesus, complete humanity, Christ, deity, and he says humanity, and deity came to earth in the flesh, and that is the touchstone.
[time=3273] Was Jesus God in the flesh?
[time=3279] Now, this morning, I don't want to be contentious, but I also don't want to be unclear.
[time=3286] So I want to tell you what various groups believe that appear to be believers in Christ.
[time=3295] And this morning, not to throw stones, but for clarity.
[time=3299] I want to name names.
[time=3301] I've already alluded to the Church of the Mormons.
[time=3305] The Mormons believe that Jesus actually came to earth,
[time=3313] but the Mormons do not believe what we believe about Jesus.
[time=3318] You see, we believe that Jesus always existed in eternity past.
[time=3323] When was Christ born?
[time=3325] He wasn't born.
[time=3326] He was always there.
[time=3329] The Mormons teach that he is a first child born of God, Elohim.
[time=3337] They deny that he is the eternal God who is, who was, who always shall be.
[time=3345] The Jehovah Witness teach that Jesus is actually Michael the Archangel.
[time=3350] He is not an angel.
[time=3352] He is God.
[time=3354] They teach not only that he is Michael the Archangel, but that he was God's first creation.
[time=3359] He is not God's first creation.
[time=3361] He is God the Creator.
[time=3363] And they teach that Jesus Christ arose from the grave spiritually, but not physically.
[time=3368] He bodily arose from the grave.
[time=3371] There's a group of people who follow the teachings of the Armstrongs, who don't even have consistency themselves.
[time=3378] But they teach that Jesus was conceived by Mary and that he was not God the Son.
[time=3385] A little closer to home, there's a group of people called the Way International.
[time=3389] They are not the Way because Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
[time=3395] And no man comes to the Father but by Him.
[time=3398] And in the Way they teach that Jesus is God's Son.
[time=3402] You said, "That sounds right." But they teach that he is God's Son, but he is not God the Son.
[time=3409] And that is the issue.
[time=3411] That God came to earth in the flesh, in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3419] Today there are three ways to deny Christ.
[time=3423] Way number one is to deny that he is the Lord.
[time=3428] That's what these groups are doing.
[time=3431] And some of you today may deny that Jesus Christ is the Lord.
[time=3436] There's a second way to deny the Lord and that is to deny that he is the Lord by saying, "He is not my Lord." You may academically say, "Yeah, I believe what we're hearing this Sunday morning." That Jesus Christ was actually God who came in human form.
[time=3453] I believe he is the Lord, but you've never received him.
[time=3456] And you've not allowed him to be your Lord.
[time=3459] There's a third way that you can deny Christ.
[time=3462] And that is to confess him with your lips, but to deny him with your life.
[time=3470] To that group of people, Jesus Christ said, "When they came unto him, they said, "Lord, Lord," he said, "I never knew you."
[time=3483] Apostasy was moving into the church.
[time=3487] Jude says, "We must contend for the faith." How do we contend for the faith?
[time=3492] We contend by confessing and declaring and living that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=3500] Have you received him if you never have today, would you open up your heart to him?
[time=3507] [MUSIC]
[time=3520] It truly is a privilege each week to bring you special music and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3527] As we close today, I trust that perhaps some of you have made a decision concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3534] If you've made a decision today, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3538] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3541] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Christ Jesus to come and die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3548] And I know today that I have sinned my heart and I ask you to come in and to cleanse me of that sin and forgive me of those wrongs that I've done.
[time=3556] I ask you to come in today, in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed this prayer with me today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3566] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3574] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error", please write to the Bible hour.
[time=3583] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1314, or use the sermon title "Acts of the Apostates", and please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3613] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club, a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry.
