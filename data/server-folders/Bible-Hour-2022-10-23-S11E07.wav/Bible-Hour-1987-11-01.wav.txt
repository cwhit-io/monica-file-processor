[time=90] (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) Jude teaches the harsh reality that God does punish sin.
[time=122] Many times we try to be so gracious we are afraid to tell people that God punishes sin.
[time=128] And in our graciousness we fail to warn them. Some would say we're afraid that we would drive them away. One man put it this way.
[time=137] Don't be afraid you're going to drive somebody away. There is no hell number two to drive them to.
[time=145] The point there is a real hell.
[time=148] People are headed for it and it is our responsibility to warn them so that they might escape.

[time=166] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox. Thank you for joining us.
[time=170] Rick is continuing his series from the Book of Jude with a message he has entitled, "Will God really punish people?" The question is often posed, "How can a loving God punish people?" Perhaps that inquiry can best be answered with another question, "How can a just God not punish sin?" God is both loving and just, and as Christ he punished sin and now offers forgiveness.
[time=196] Today's study in Jude teaches us that God has and will punish sin.
[time=201] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can't study along with us. We will be looking at Jude verses 5 through 11.
[time=209] Our special music includes a song from the Sanctuary Choir, a solo from Marilyn Wong, and Kevin Rowe.
[time=220] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Point, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=229] We pray that the Lord will use this minister to you.
[time=233] Now here's Rick.
[time=237] It is a joy every Sunday morning to come to this place and to somewhat symbolically leave the burdens of our hearts at the door and to come and say God, no matter what else is happening, you are worthy of glory and praise, and we've come today to sing of your majesty. We're delighted that you've come today. You may have been here on the wings of joy and victory. We're happy for you.
[time=263] Others of you may have crawled here bearing deep burdens.
[time=267] Either way, we've come today to bring our hearts to the Lord and to praise His name.
[time=273] Thank you for worshiping with us.
[time=275] We also want to welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour. We are meeting today because He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, and our choir declares that this morning He is the King.
[time=317] He is the King, and we will
[time=323] sing His praise.
[time=325] We do not need.
[time=329] And Lord of Lords forever.
[time=333] Jesus is the King.
[time=339] We will be here.
[time=345] Kings and queens and men.
[time=347] Residents and servants.
[time=351] The people of all nations will gather on that day.
[time=355] We will heal before the game.
[time=359] Not the King of servers.
[time=363] We will lift our voices.
[time=367] We will sing.
[time=371] He is the King.
[time=375] And we will reign forever.
[time=379] He is the King.
[time=383] And we will sing His praise.
[time=385] We do not need.
[time=389] And Lord of Lords forever.
[time=393] Jesus is the King.
[time=397] He is the King.
[time=401] And we will come to the King.
[time=405] He is our salvation.
[time=409] Master of the universe.
[time=413] Lord of all creation.
[time=417] He is the King.
[time=425] And He will reign forever.
[time=429] He is the King.
[time=433] And we will sing His praise.
[time=437] He is the King.
[time=441] And He is Lord of Lords forever.
[time=445] Jesus.
[time=449] He is the King.
[time=453] The King of kings.
[time=477] Amen. He is the King of kings.
[time=481] And Lord of Lords, to God we give all of the glory.
[time=485] Him number 52. To God be the glory reflecting on the great things that He's done in our lives. Him number 52.
[time=499] Jesus.
[time=711] Pastor Rick already mentioned that we come here with varying degrees of difficulties in our lives.
[time=715] Some of us are rejoicing because of the great things God specifically did in your life today.
[time=721] Others of you are hurting because of death or illness in the family.
[time=725] We can bring all of our burdens to the Lord. That's the privilege of knowing him as Savior.
[time=731] Not that all the burdens go away, but that we can tell Jesus and we do not have to bear the burdens alone.
[time=737] Maryland Wong is going to come and quiet our hearts now and remind us that we have that wonderful privilege of going to the Savior with our burdens.
[time=747] We can bear them with him and he will help us.
[time=751] I must tell Jesus.
[time=763] all of my trials I cannot bear these burdens in my distress he kindly will help me.
[time=787] He ever loves and cares for his own.
[time=795] I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus I cannot bear these burdens alone I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus Jesus can help me
[time=827] Jesus alone I must tell Jesus all of my troubles He is a kind compassionate friend if I but ask him
[time=853] he will deliver make all my troubles
[time=863] quickly and end I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus
[time=877] I cannot bear these burdens
[time=883] alone I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus Jesus can help me Jesus alone I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus
[time=915] I cannot bear these
[time=921] burdens alone I must tell Jesus I must tell Jesus Jesus can help me Jesus alone Hello again and we are so thankful that you've joined us today for the Bible hour and we'd love to meet you in person and so allow us to invite you to join us for this year's living Christmas tree Pete you were just telling me you bought all the construction materials and the music is already well rehearsed but it's still early November well when the corner turns from October to November then all of a sudden things really start happening and this weekend we got all the materials and the choir is working faithfully and we announced in the newspaper that public sale tickets or that is public distribution of tickets would be this Saturday November 14th particular advertisement says November 15th but it really is this next Saturday November 14th from 9am to 5pm Well I'm looking forward to that we love the ministry of the living Christmas tree but there's a special additional opportunity for Pete and for me and that is when those thousands and thousands come for the living Christmas tree many of them are people like you who watch the Bible hour regularly and we've never had the privilege of meeting you and taking your hand and every year during the living Christmas tree as people leave I meet numbers of Bible hour viewers and that's always special it is really neat obviously when the choir prepares this program of this magnitude we're delighted when you come so that we can share it with you and that's our special privilege a Christmas gift if you will to our community and friends well if you're thinking of coming to the living Christmas tree please don't say to yourself that's in December and when December comes I'll go get tickets usually long before Thanksgiving all the tickets we have have been given out so if you want tickets we encourage you to come Saturday November the 14th and what are the times?
[time=1057] The time is 9am to 5pm in the Convocation Center right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and our address is 7321 East State Boulevard at Laymeyer Road. Thank you Pete.
[time=1069] Today we would like to offer you a very helpful booklet many of you watch the Bible hour week by week and you may recall we're studying in the book of Jude and in last week's message we talked about various groups that do not believe that Jesus Christ was actually God that he always existed and we began to identify various groups and what they believed here at Black Hawk numbers of people asked me where can I get that information well it all came from a pamphlet entitled The Spirit of Truth and you're looking at a copy of that pamphlet right now it's a beautiful publication in color and it gives to us an overview of several Bible doctrines what does the Bible say about God the Lord Jesus Christ sin salvation eternal destiny and what God will do about punishing sin then it not only tells you what the Bible says but it goes column by column telling what various groups like the Moonies are the Eastern mystics believe and what American groups like the Jehovah Witness and the Mormons believe it's all laid out on one piece of paper beautifully displayed and we'd love to send you a copy so that you can grow by the reading of God's Word so if you're right to us today we'll send you your copy free. You can receive a copy of this pamphlet by writing to the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815 once again that's the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. When you write even if you're not asking for the pamphlet your letters mean so much. Pete this past week we got a letter from a lady in a nursing home in Warsaw, Indiana they watched the Bible hour there on channel 46 and she said that there are a group of people in this nursing home who simply wait for six o'clock to come so that they can all go down and they say they have church together with the Bible hour. That's really great and sometimes we're unaware of that Rick and that letter just a brief note telling us that you do indeed discipline yourselves and get up and watch the Bible hour really as an encouragement to us. We do appreciate the mail that comes and we would like to ask you again to write perhaps you would like the pamphlet we'd be glad to send that to you our address is the Bible hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. Then when you write it would be of interest and of help to us if you would tell us on what television station you are watching the Bible hour. You might be watching on channel 21 here in Fort Wayne at 7 in the morning or you may be watching it in Lime, Ohio or in South Bend or Marion. Please let us know the station or the time in which you're watching the Bible hour Thank you so much for being a part of the Bible hour today and as we go back to our morning worship service we're looking forward to worshiping the Lord in song and studying God's Word. So if you don't have your Bible would you grab it right now and find the Book of Jude and we'll study today does God really punish sin? We'll answer that question from God's Word.

[time=1497] Father we ask you to crush the barriers of social indifference
[time=1503] God we ask you to tear down the isolation That we have built up between ourselves and others God help us to care more about lonely people than filling our lives with activities
[time=1517] God help us to care more about a world that is hungry for Christ
[time=1523] Than our own preoccupation with new and more And better and best of every spiritual blessing God help us to be preoccupied with sharing Instead of accumulating God I ask you to break my heart To make me more tender To make me more sensitive More approachable God while your spirit moves in our hearts We would also ask today for your healing And your encouragement We pray today for Elsie Saylor She battles for her health A friend by the name of Bo Schroeder Whose heart is weak We pray today for Paul's mother She recovers from a surgery In a battle against cancer God today We ask you to meet each heart at its point of need God today through your word we ask you to speak to us We might know today that your word is true That we might have confidence in it today And we might walk by faith In Jesus' name Amen Allow me to ask you this question this morning Do you believe that God punishes sin?
[time=1619] Do you believe that God will punish you if you sin?
[time=1627] Do you believe that God is of such a character that he will execute his justice and righteousness in the form of punishment?
[time=1639] Do you believe God punishes sin?
[time=1643] There are a variety of theologies that give us a variety of answers Many of those would say no God will not ultimately send anyone to hell therefore eternity to be punished One particular theological school is called universalism They believe that somehow some way something will be done by God that everybody goes to heaven The salvation is universal and they are called universalists It's rather simple It's rather straightforward God is going to save everyone God does not punish sin Others have a more moderating position They see that God is love but they also see that he is just and so they have built within their concepts of theological structures that God must punish sin but they cannot believe that they cannot punish it forever and so they have an intermediate state Some go immediately to heaven Others go to this intermediate state and there they are victims of punishment but only for a while It is a place of purging and some have built a purgatory where you have purged for a time, it may be days, it may be years but you are purged to heaven because God will not always punish sin But most today do not root their belief in any theology They are more esoteric They more base that upon their own experiences We might call them existential idolaters Now when we think of idolatry we think of this old figure out of history who takes wood in this statue and he says this is my God or we picture this man chiseling away at rock forming an image and then cladding it with more precious metal and making an idol and saying this is who I worship We don't do that in our society We are too educated We are too sophisticated to say I worship stone or wood or rock but we are existential And the theology says I feel and my concept of reality is governed by my concept of what I feel I do not feel God would punish me I do not feel God would send anyone to hell particularly someone like me And so based out of this existential feeling and perspective we believe and our convictions rise out of our own hearts desires though we have no idols We are idolaters We have made up our own God We have defined him according to our own comforts and we have limited him according to our own convictions or lack thereof Pistemology is that science that says how do we know what we know the scripture says we know because it's been revealed because God has said in his word Do you believe God will punish sin?
[time=1859] If you have your Bible today I invite you to turn to the book of Jude Jude is a short one chapter letter from the pen of Jude to a mixed multitude By that I mean many of the people who would read this would be born again Believers in Christ Many would be in that same audience who would not hold to the conviction that Jesus is Lord and so it is a mixed group and in verses three and four we studied those last week He very pointedly describes them He is a name caller We don't like name callers I'm politically motivated We were at a dinner a number of weeks ago and the lady said that she was 70 years old did I think she looked to be 70 I said ma'am my job rests on hundreds of people approving of me every week I don't think anybody looks over 40 We're politically minded aren't we? We're not name callers We don't lean across the table and say 70 well you old bat you look 85 to me we don't do that type of thing it just doesn't flow we like name callers we like people who point and say and Jude does this ungodly then go over well blasphemer doesn't sound tasteful You have perverted God's grace into a license for sin You are a denier of Christ we don't like those words it's not our culture but their words that Jude would use and their words that our generation needs to hear but some would hear Jude out and hear these names and they would say oh come on and these guys go to our church they usher they teach Sunday school why they're deacons one of them is on the staff you really don't mean those guys do you?
[time=1991] God's really not going to punish them and so the answer to those feelings come in verses 5 through 11 Will God punish sin? Allow me to read those verses for you and I'm using the new international version though you already know all this I want to remind you that the Lord delivered his people out of Egypt but later destroyed those who did not believe and the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their home these he has kept in darkness bound with everlasting chains for judgment on that great day in a similar way Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion they serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire in the very same way these dreamers pollute their own bodies reject authority and slander celestial beings but even the Archangel Michael when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him but said the Lord rebuke you and yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand and what things they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals these are the very things that destroy them woe to them they have taken the way of Cain they have rushed for the prophet unto Balaam's heir they have been destroyed in Cora's rebellion well the question that would linger in the mind of Jude's audience that would be so relevant today is one that says does God really punish sin?
[time=2147] does a loving God really send anyone to hell?
[time=2151] does God really zap people today?
[time=2155] I mean right here on earth in life does God punish sin?
[time=2161] well he begins by saying though you already know this I want to remind you do you know that most of us and this isn't the flatter me and it's not the flatter you most of us don't need to learn another thing most of us already know all that we need to know what we need is to be reminded and challenged to do it for example most of us know we ought to spend a little less money and save a little more we know that but the urge to buy overcomes most of us know a good diet plan many of us know three four or five good diet plans most of us know what exercise we need the most it is not sit-ups it is not push-ups it is push-backs to come to the table and push yourself back instead of staying there and eating forever we know those things but we need to be reminded and the same thing is true in our spiritual life most of the time it's not a lack of knowledge it's a lack of remembering and applying Jude says I'm going to tell you some things you know but you need to be reminded and now he is going to break forth into a history lesson I feel at home now if this was a science lesson I would struggle with history that's my interest and he is going to use history to answer these feelings God really got to punish these guys God really got to punish us he begins first of all with three history lessons one is found in verse six one in verse five one in verse six one in verse seven now here is basically an outline you can follow this intermediate point three history illustrations each of them he describes each of them he gives a destiny as Egypt he says you remember the Lord delivered his people that's Israel out of Egypt but later he destroyed those who did not believe he said his people out of Egypt that would take them back to an event that we call the exodus the way out the Israelites had under the days of Joseph migrated to Egypt there was famine in Egypt or in Israel and there was abundance in Egypt and they migrated later there rose up a Pharaoh who knew not Joseph and he began to enslave the Israelites God then raised up a Moses to lead them out and this description of Israel as these are the people who were led out of Egypt in first Corinthians chapter 10 verses 1 through 3 the apostle Paul also refers back to this same history lesson and in that particular passage he says five things about these people who were delivered he said I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact brothers that are fourth authors who all were under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea they were all baptized in the Moses in the cloud and in the sea they all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them and that rock was Christ now taking Paul's additional insight to Jude there was an exodus and Paul says and all the people were delivered historians put the number in millions and millions and millions of people and all of them had five things in common they were all under that cloud that guided them they did not wander aimlessly originally they were guided people secondly they all passed through the Red Sea there was the thundering hoofbeats and the pounding wheels of the chariots of the Egyptians coming to crush them and God opened up the Red Sea and they all went through it and they all could look back and see their enemies enveloped by the crushing waves and drowned and they all were baptized in the Moses that meant they were all placed in identification with Moses and they all ate what is it manna it came down from heaven they didn't know what it was so in Hebrew they said manna what is it they called it what is it and they all drank water that came out of a rock every one of them all of them that's how they're described they're described as the people that God led out but noticed their destiny he said but those who did not believe he later destroyed you see as they went through the Red Sea they then marched onward and they came to a point called katish barnia but it was not a geographical crossing as much as it was a spiritual crossing spies were sent out into the land two of them Joshua and Caleb came back and said it's a good land we need to go for it God will deliver us Ten said oh there are a lot of people there they've got big cities with huge walls and there are giants in the land and then this great statement of self-esteem and we were in our own eyes but grasshoppers and so were we in their eyes and so God said
[time=2532] for the forty days that the spies held a recognizant mission in the land for each of those days you'll spend one year wandering in the wilderness forty years so you all die off the only ones then are the promised land were to be Joshua and Caleb and the children under 20 a history lesson a reminder allow me to draw these two applications one, God punishes sin in this case it was the sin of unbelief they refused to trust God and he destroyed them in the wilderness application number two there is no salvation by association you see they all were baptized with Moses they were all under the cloud they all ate what is it?
[time=2596] but they all were not saved because of common experience you know today you cannot be saved because you simply attend this church many of you may have found a false sense of security and you feel like somehow you've been made acceptable to God because you've come here week by week, week by week but association cannot save you may have joined this church you may have been baptized in a great church but that doesn't save you you have to be born again in the God's family by faith believing in Christ two applications one, God punishes sin two there is no salvation by association history lesson number two the angels, well we knew a lot about Israel and Egypt we don't know much about these angels they are described in this way the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home these he has kept in darkness bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great judgment day well these angels are no small matter of debate there are four different theories as to who these angels happen to be theory number one is this describing Satan and the angels who rebelled with him they were cast out of heaven they didn't keep their first position they abandoned their home that all fits except for the next phrase says they are held in chains in darkness and I don't think the scripture teaches that Satan is presently held in chains in darkness but that's one theory a second theory is very very elaborate it says in Genesis chapter 1 that the sons of God took the daughters of men and there was something immoral implied there some say the word sons of God refers to angels and it occasionally does and so what they say Genesis 6 is the sons of God the angels came to earth became incorporated in the bodies then took immoral relationships with daughters of men and that's the angels who fell and God now has them chained that's theory number two theory number three is Jude is referring to theory number two but not necessarily accepting it as fact only stating it as a known story and using it as an illustration we do that all the time today we take stories that we don't necessarily believe are true and we use those for illustrations for example you believe that there was a real George Washington I believe there was a real George Washington I don't know that he chopped down his dad's favorite cherry tree but we use that story to teach the value of honesty son George Washington his dad found out he chopped down the cherry tree he said son did you chop down my favorite cherry tree and the little boy George said yes I cannot tell a lie I did and son George's dad was so proud of me told the truth he didn't give him a weapon two days later father comes to a son he says son were you shooting your shotgun at the outhouse little boy remembers the story he said dad I cannot tell a lie I did his dad gave him the weapon of his life he said dad I thought if I was like George Washington I always told the truth you wouldn't give me a weapon he said son George's dad wasn't in the cherry tree when he chopped it down that story has nothing to do with
[time=2826] today's message but half of you laughed and the other half said what he say and they woke back up that's a story I don't know that George Washington chopped down his dad's favorite cherry tree and I don't know that his dad did or did not give him a weapon but I'll tell it to my son as an illustration to tell the truth maybe Jude was saying you've heard this story about the angels and they came to earth and they did this and they did that maybe he's only using it elastratively and not substantiating it as historicity theory number four is we know no more about this than what Jude tells us and we're not going to speculate now if you'll come back tonight at six o'clock for a bible study I'll give you all the details of that this Jude says there were angels they sinned, they rebelled against God that's their description and their destiny God took them and he has chained them in darkness and he's holding them for judgment two applications one God punishes sin this time it was the sin of rebellion God said I want you in this position they said we don't want that position and they rebelled application number one that we learned from the angels God punishes sin application number two he doesn't always do it right away in this situation God said I'm going to take those angels I'm going to hold them and it's not going to be the judgment day that they get my ultimate punishment God punishes sin but it's not always right away sometimes we think I got away with it I did it but I'm slick I don't think you're slick God may punish you yet it doesn't always happen the morning after history lesson number three Sodom and Gomorrah Sodom and Gomorrah verse seven in a similar way Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion they serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire we owe a great deal to archaeology at this point archaeologists have told us the surrounding cities they have discovered many of them Sodom and Gomorrah had at least these three surrounding cities Zeboem and Zor these cities are described two ways they're description one they have given themselves up to sexual immorality the Greek word here is the word Pornea from which we get porno and pornographic but it's not the simple word it's a little proclitic pronoun that gives it the force of excessive immorality they are described as a very, very sexually immoral people and then secondly they're described as those who gave themselves up to perversion we know what that perversion is because Genesis 18 and 19 describes Sodom and Gomorrah along with heterosexual perversion there was common homosexual perversion and that is why one of the grotesque acts of homosexuality is called Sodomy it takes its name from Sodom that's how they're described their destiny it says that God punished them and uses them as an example of punishment of eternal fire archaeologists have done this enormous amount of work in this area you see critics of the Bible say I read that story about Sodom and Gomorrah out of Genesis 18 and 19 and God rained fire and brimstone that's just mythology that's fabulous telling of stories that's the exaggeration of oral tradition that went from one person to another and to another and by the time Moses heard it and wrote it down and he was coming in in his blue ox babe but listen to the record of archaeology archaeologists have done a number of digs that sounds like a little kid's term but that's what archaeologists call them you know you get these guys with 3-H-P-H-D's and what are you going to do I'm going to go on a dig but they're out there digging so they call it a dig technical language but there have been many digs uncovered the city of Zor Zor is one of these surrounding cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and it is very conclusive that Sodom, Gomorrah, Adama, and Zebelim are underneath several layers of silt and time moved sand and they're now beneath what we now call the dead sea and just off the present seashore is the dig which uncovered Zor and it is the conclusion of scientists as they have examined this dig that what happened is in that region of the ground there are rich deposits of oil and butumen a substance like tar we should have known that because earlier in Genesis it tells us in that region there was pitch and there was tar that technology and science has revealed is that Zor was destroyed it appears that what happened is these near surface subterranean reservoirs of butumen and oil rose to the surface by some type of rupture in the earth's surface they were exposed and ignited and like a volcano erupted throwing into the air fiery hot oil very hot pitch and tar fiery hot sulfur and then that like Mount St. Helens erupted into a cloud or Vesuvius and burnt and destroyed those five cities you see when you read the Bible and it tells you something that sounds out of this world if God says he did it he did it and you can trust his word archaeology is found the historicity of Sodom and Gomorrah to be factual to the details it did rain down on them fire and brimstone two applications application number one God punishes sin this time it's the sin of immorality God punishes sin application number two sometimes he does it in this lifetime he didn't choose for Sodom and Gomorrah Zor Zor Zebelim Adman to wait he said I'm going to destroy him now so don't ever sit in the security he says well I'm going to do my own thing I'm going to follow my own instincts I'm going to have it my way before God but maybe I'll get it right between now and then God may choose to demonstrate his justice now that's all history
[time=3308] but in verse eight he brings it back to contemporary reality he said in the very same way these dreamers now by using the word dreamer he didn't mean that they fell asleep in English class this is a very familiar term to a Hebrew audience a dreamer of dreams men of profit and in Deuteronomy chapter 13 it said watch out for the dreamers those who are false prophets who said I see this and I saw that and God gave me a dream and they mislead you he said these dreamers he does the same thing as he did before he gives a description and then a destiny the description multitudinous he said first of all they pollute their own bodies he's referring to their sexual permissiveness they gave grace out as a license to sin he said they reject authority just like the Israelites rejected God's authority and Moses's authority it says they slander celestial beings angels as best I understand that these people were rejecting the revelation of God that often came by angelic dispatch and they were rejecting God's revelation and now as a little aside he gives another illustration he said hey when Moses died and Satan and Michael were arguing over his body Michael didn't even argue with the fallen angel Satan instead he said the Lord rebuke you again this is a passage we ignore of no other reference in scripture the battle between Michael and Satan over the body of Moses is it historical?
[time=3412] it may well be if it's not a historical Jude is simply using it because it was a common story that the Hebrew people that they believed and he was simply using it like the cherry tree to say if Michael didn't argue with the fallen angel who are we to argue with living angels except the word of God describes them further he said these people verse 10 they're spiritually ignorant they speak abusively of what they don't understand they don't understand the deity of Christ so they speak abusively against it and what they do understand by instinct like animals without reasoning facilities that's put in them these are the things that destroy them some things they're ignorant of other things they're indifferent this they know and they still go ahead and pollute their bodies now he gives their destiny one word whoa it's a word that means impending judgment it is a word that means catastrophe it's a word that means destruction and doom and judgment whoa does God punish sin the answer is whoa he does God punishes sin that's the bad news but the good news is that he chose to punish it in Christ and Christ died for our sins and if we will believe in him he will forgive us
