[time=90] A pastor was called to the home of one of his dying parishioners.
[time=110] In order to comfort the man, he asked if he could read to him some scriptures from his own Bible.
[time=117] The Bible was retrieved and given to the pastor, and when he opened it, it was the shambles.
[time=123] Huge sections of the Bible had been removed, and of the few pages that remained verses had been clipped out across through.
[time=132] Quite surprised the minister said to the man, "What's happened to your Bible?"
[time=138] The dying man responded that his Bible was fine until that minister had come to their church.
[time=145] Over the years, this minister had told him that this section was not true, and these things were false and that they shouldn't believe in another part.
[time=153] The man said, "Every time you told us that, I either removed the verses or crossed them out or pulled out the pages."
[time=160] In fact, the dying man said, "If you'd have been here much longer, I wouldn't have had anything left.
[time=168] Nothing but the cover."
[time=180] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=185] We're glad you joined us.
[time=187] Rick's message today is entitled, "Are the Bad Guys Really So Bad?" and is taken from the New Testament book of Jude.
[time=194] Nothing left but the covers.
[time=196] That fragmented Bible is a graphic illustration of far too many lives, having left God departed from Bible study and fallen away from the knowledge of Christ.
[time=206] Many people have become spiritually empty.
[time=209] Jude describes the spread of false teachers as clouds without rain and an autumn trees that produce no fruit.
[time=216] Jude saw those who departed from the faith in Christ as big talkers with empty promises.
[time=222] Are the bad guys really so bad, stay with us and study with us as we discover the certain promises of God?
[time=230] We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study with us.
[time=233] We will be looking at Jude verses 12 through 16.
[time=237] Our special music today includes a song from the sanctuary choir, celebration and Lynn Roll.
[time=247] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Rock Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=253] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=257] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=262] Now here's Rick.
[time=264] We also want to welcome our friends who join us now for the Bible hour.
[time=269] As we meet this morning, our choir leads us in a great majestic song of praise that our rock of faith is Jesus.
[time=277] Are you standing today on a solid rock?
[time=280] Are you positioned on Jesus Christ?
[time=282] The rock of faith is Jesus.
[time=304] We pray that the Lord will use this love instead.
[time=307] He's laid his light a tower.
[time=309] We pray that the Lord will use this love instead.
[time=312] He's laid his light a tower.
[time=314] We pray that the Lord will use this love instead.
[time=317] He's laid his light a tower.
[time=319] We pray that the Lord will use this love instead.
[time=322] He's laid his light a tower.
[time=323] We pray that the Lord will use this love instead.
[time=325] He's laid his light a tower.
[time=326] We pray that the Lord will use this love instead.
[time=327] He's laid his light a tower.
[time=328] We pray that the Lord will use this love instead.
[time=461] [APPLAUSE]
[time=473] We come to worship together.
[time=474] And one of the focal points is the praise, the name of the Lord.
[time=477] And let him know that we love him because he is our Savior.
[time=481] I sing the mighty power of God.
[time=483] Him number 32.
[time=484] We'll sing all three verses.
[time=486] Him number 32.
[time=488] [MUSIC]
[time=506] I sing the mighty power of God.
[time=532] I sing the goodness of the Lord.
[time=553] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=623] Well, we just sang one of my favorite hymns.
[time=626] And I hope it was as meaningful to you as it was to me.
[time=630] This morning as I came in, I didn't have a full cup to use David's words.
[time=635] My own heart wasn't refreshed.
[time=637] These have been tough days for numbers of family in our church.
[time=642] But in that first service through the ministry of music, God filled my own heart.
[time=646] My cup was overflowing this morning.
[time=648] So the first hour I preached for 58 minutes, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
[time=653] And this next hour, there's no service to follow, so the message will be about an hour and a half.
[time=658] But I just thank the music department.
[time=660] They filled my heart.
[time=662] But today, many of you have asked how is our building program going, and I just wanted to give you a few seconds of update.
[time=668] Much of the progress is right on schedule.
[time=671] Some of it is even ahead.
[time=673] One of the elements we're waiting for are some metal panels that finish and enclose the building.
[time=678] If you want to pray for something, pray for an early shipment of metal panels.
[time=682] But just by way of encouragement, the building is well on schedule.
[time=686] We'll be looking forward to getting into it in August, and your giving has made that possible.
[time=691] We receive commitments of a little over a million and a half dollars to come in over three years.
[time=696] It's been 10 months, and almost half of that money has come in.
[time=700] And we want to thank you for your faithfulness.
[time=702] There are days when we simply want to praise God for His goodness, and you may have burdens today, but we just want to invite you to lay those down, to relax, and as a song now says, "To throw back your head and sing."
[time=716] Sing from a laughing heart.
[time=721] Just sing when the night is dark.
[time=724] Just sing.
[time=725] Let your joys flow and let music fill the air.
[time=730] You can sing when there's nothing else to do.
[time=733] Sing for something deep inside of you tells you that life is still the one to just throw back your head and sing.
[time=741] Then he said sing.
[time=743] From a laughing heart, just sing when the night is dark.
[time=747] Just sing.
[time=748] Let your joys flow and let music fill the air.
[time=753] You can sing when there's nothing else to do.
[time=756] Sing for something deep inside of you tells you that life is still the one to just throw back your head and sing.
[time=764] When God created living things, you would need a way to share our fears, our questions, and our dreams.
[time=778] So there were words, but words won't do, the joy swells up inside.
[time=783] You simply had to be a better way.
[time=788] Sing.
[time=790] From a laughing heart, just sing.
[time=792] Sing when the night is dark.
[time=794] Just sing.
[time=795] Let your joys flow and let music fill the air.
[time=800] You can sing when there's nothing else to do.
[time=803] Sing, sing when the night is dark.
[time=806] If you tells you that life is still the one to just throw back your head and sing.
[time=812] First, God said on Christ, he wins the kill.
[time=815] The sky was strong.
[time=817] He put music in the gross and crashing sea.
[time=822] And the wind moved through the blaze of grass, like fingers through the stream.
[time=827] A golden arch that feeds the metal's ring and he sings.
[time=832] You just sing.
[time=834] From a laughing heart, just sing.
[time=836] Sing when the night is dark.
[time=838] You can sing.
[time=839] Let your joys flow and let music fill the air.
[time=844] You can sing when there's nothing else to do.
[time=847] Sing, sing when there's something deep inside of you tells you that life is still the one to just throw back your head and sing.
[time=855] Sing, sing when the night is dark.
[time=862] Let your joys flow and let music fill the air.
[time=867] You can sing when there's nothing else to do.
[time=871] You can sing when there's something deep inside of you tells you that life is still the one to just throw back your head and sing.
[time=911] Sing when there's something else to do.
[time=917] Sing when there's something deep inside of you tells you that life is still the one to just throw back your head and sing.
[time=930] Let your joys flow to let music fill the air.
[time=934] You can sing when there's something deep inside of you tells you that life is still the one to just throw back your head and sing.
[time=953] Let your joys flow to let music fill the air.
[time=958] You can sing.
[time=967] These are exciting days for us.
[time=978] We're planning and working and anticipating the living Christmas tree.
[time=982] And by the time you have the opportunity of watching this tape we will have already begun the public distribution of our tickets.
[time=989] Although today as we pre-record this show we don't know how that went but I imagine many of the concerts the tickets are completely gone.
[time=997] At least that's usually the history.
[time=999] Well on Saturday November 14th which was yesterday as we view this we had the public distribution.
[time=1005] As Rick said we really just don't have any calculation of how many tickets were given away in the public distribution.
[time=1011] But if you'd like to receive tickets or check on the number of tickets that are available for each program you can call the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 749-8524 and ask for the living Christmas tree ticket office.
[time=1025] They can explain to you the number of tickets that are available in the nights that we are giving the living Christmas tree.
[time=1031] And if you would like tickets you can reserve them by making that phone call and we will save the tickets for you so that you can come here and pick them up.
[time=1040] But we're only able to save the tickets for one week.
[time=1043] Many times people call they reserve tickets and they don't come and pick those up.
[time=1047] After a week we put them back in the General Hopper and the next group that comes in and requests them gets those tickets.
[time=1054] Tell us a little bit about the music that we're going to hear this year.
[time=1057] Well Rick it's written by Claire Clolinger. It's entitled A Son, A Savior.
[time=1063] Some really beautiful work. I've been very impressed in recent years of what Claire has done with the text of the music.
[time=1068] And again she weaves some beautiful new pieces of music with some of the old traditional carols and songs that we're accustomed to at the Christmas time.
[time=1076] The first part of the program will be very exciting and just get us into the Christmas spirit and then we'll reflect on Jesus Christ the Savior of the world as He came in the form of a baby.
[time=1086] Well I'm looking forward to that and we do want you to come but you'll need tickets to be a part of it and so we ask you to act quickly by coming here to the church and picking up your tickets or at least calling and reserving those Monday through Friday.
[time=1100] And we'll save them for you one week and then you can come and pick those up.
[time=1105] We'd like to encourage you to follow along with us in our study through the Book of Jude by having one of the most helpful pamphlets I have ever had the privilege of holding in my hand.
[time=1115] It is called the spirit of truth and the spirit of air and we've selected it for this month because it fits so well with our study in the Book of Jude.
[time=1124] Jude warns us about apostates, about those who profess Christ with their mouth but in reality don't know Christ in their heart and certainly are not living a Christ like life.
[time=1136] But yet the words are sounding so good, it's called apostasy, those who have come near and then fallen away.
[time=1143] This booklet tells us about a number of groups who come close to faith in Christ but then fall away.
[time=1151] And we'd like you to have a copy of the spirit of truth and the spirit of air if you'll simply write for it today.
[time=1158] You can receive this helpful pamphlet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1169] Once again that's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1177] Pete a few Sundays ago as we were sitting through Jude a number of people came up afterwards and said where did I get all the information on various groups, the Mormons, the Mooneys, the Jehovah Witness and all of those.
[time=1188] It really came from this simple booklet, it gives you an overview of every one of those groups and what they teach and the quotes are lifted straight out of their source books.
[time=1198] And so we want you to have this so that you can be informed and please do write.
[time=1203] And while you're thinking about writing if you want the booklet or if you really don't need it because you already have one we would still love to hear from you and hear how the Lord has been working in your life and particularly using the Bible Hour.
[time=1216] Just this past week a friend was out and he met somebody, they began to talk and realized they had this ministry in common and a lady shared with this businessman that she had begun reading her Bible.
[time=1228] As a result of staying the Bible she turned on the television, found the Bible Hour and after watching the Bible Hour accepted Christ into her heart.
[time=1237] That is really a great source of encouragement as we've said many times it's so difficult to experience what's happening out there unless people write to us or tell us and that is really encouraging for all of our technicians and for us to receive news of that nature.
[time=1252] It really is and we would like to ask you to help us out by letting us know how God has been using this ministry in your life.
[time=1260] And so once again people give you the address before we go back to our morning service so that you could write us just a note to know what the Lord is doing in your life and be sure to ask for the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air.
[time=1273] We encourage you to just take a moment and write to the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815. That's the Bible Hour box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1290] Thank you Pete and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1303] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1355] And it's so good to know that you are the beginning and the end. The God of all creation, the love that never ends. And it's so good to know you're with me.
[time=1372] Guiding every step I take, though life may change around me. You'll make my pathway straight. You are forever gone.
[time=1390] Man is like a flower that fades away. You today and go on the next. Life is like a mist that glistens and disappears. Still in my mind I soon forget.
[time=1410] What we see now is not all there is. There is a kingdom to come. So I can't hang on to time and space or regret what's in the past. I can only hold on to the one who holds time in his almighty hand.
[time=1435] You are forever gone.
[time=1443] And it's so good to know that you are the beginning and the end. The God of all creation, the love that never ends. And it's so good to know you're with me.
[time=1458] Guiding every step I take, though life may change around me. Your love will not forsake. You are forever gone.
[time=1476] You are forever gone.
[time=1503] And it's so good to know that you are the beginning and the end. The God of all creation, the love that never ends. And it's so good to know you're with me.
[time=1521] Guiding every step I take, though life may change around me. Your love will not forsake. You are forever gone.
[time=1538] You are forever gone.
[time=1556] Thank you, Lynn. God, we bow before you, for you are forever God. We thank you that you guide us in every step we take.
[time=1567] Father, we pray that that sure hand of direction might rest on some troubled hearts today.
[time=1575] Thank you for the peace and the comfort that you already have given to Ed and Sherri Marie-Z in the death of the little girl Megan.
[time=1584] We pray that you would be forever the God of comfort to them.
[time=1590] We thank you today that Jack is here after a serious battle with his health. We thank you for the restoration of his body.
[time=1599] Thank you that the little freezing girl is growing stronger every day. Thank you today, Lord, that you have healed many who have gone through some tough times in their relationship with their spouse.
[time=1614] Yet, God, we pray for others who these days are days of gripping pain, of deep hurt.
[time=1621] We pray today for Becky Christian, a young girl whose health is perplexing, that she might be properly diagnosed and returned to energy and strength.
[time=1633] Father, we pray today for people who are underemployed and unemployed. Not only do they have financial needs, but many of them are suffering because of a lack of self-worth not being productive.
[time=1648] God, you are forever God, so we come to you to unburden our heart and to trust you.
[time=1656] We thank you for the quietness of this song. May it minister to those whose hearts are too heavy today that they're not able to throw back their head and sing, but they can quietly reflect and praise you for you, our God, in Jesus' name and many.
[time=1676] A pastor was called to the home of a dying parishioner, thinking that he might comfort the man. The pastor said, "Could I read you some scriptures from your own Bible?"
[time=1690] And so the Bible was retrieved from the shelf and placed in the pastor's hands. Much to the pastor's surprise when he opened it, large sections of the Bible had been obviously torn out and removed.
[time=1704] Other pages had been clipped and some of the pages that remained had verses crossed out with bold, bold strikes of ink.
[time=1714] The pastor was a bit taken back and simply said to the man in surprise, "What happened to your Bible?"
[time=1725] The man said, "Well, before you came to our church and became our pastor, my Bible was fine, but over the years you taught us that we shouldn't believe certain parts of it, that those really weren't true."
[time=1737] Then you told us other things were just mythology and so I cut those out.
[time=1742] And then the things you said were supernatural and not meant to be taken literally, I just crossed out.
[time=1748] Then the dying man reflected, he said, "You know what? If you'd have been here any longer, I wouldn't have had anything left except for the cover."
[time=1758] That tells the story of not only many Bibles. The pages, if not ripped out, are totally ignored but tells the story of many lives.
[time=1768] There are many of us here today that's spiritually, there isn't much here, nothing more than a cover.
[time=1777] On the inside, there's no Christ. On the inside, there's no indwelling Holy Spirit.
[time=1784] On the inside, there's no surrendered will that says, "I want to follow Christ."
[time=1790] Not much here, but the cover. Jude wrote a very short but pointed epistle talking about empty teaching and empty lives.
[time=1804] If you have your Bible today, I invite you to study with us from the Book of Jude.
[time=1809] It comes at the end of the Bible, Jude then revelation.
[time=1813] One chapter long, we have been studying it for several weeks. Today we're going to study verses 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
[time=1825] While you're finding it, let me just set the stage that Jude has spoken very harshly about false teachers and those are the individuals to whom he's making reference when we pick up the narrative in verse 12.
[time=1840] Jude verses 12 through 16.
[time=1844] These men are blemishes at your love feast, eating with you without the slightest qualm.
[time=1855] Shepherds who feed only themselves, their clouds without rain, blown by the wind, autumn trees, without fruit,
[time=1868] uprooted twice dead.
[time=1872] They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame, wandering stars, for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
[time=1888] Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men.
[time=1893] See the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of His holy ones to judge everyone and to convict all the ungodly for all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way.
[time=1907] And all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.
[time=1915] These men are grumblers, fault-finders.
[time=1920] They follow their own evil desires.
[time=1924] They boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
[time=1933] Jude certainly is not trying to win friends or influence people.
[time=1939] He's certainly not a candidate for political office. He has not learned to find art of speaking very clearly and saying nothing.
[time=1946] He is a man who is pointing fingers at specific individuals. His stance is clear.
[time=1956] And as he speaks, he is telling us these three things today.
[time=1962] What are these false teachers like? What waits for them? And why are they so judged?
[time=1971] Under that first section, what are these false teachers like? For you English teachers and students of literature, this is a masterpiece.
[time=1979] He develops five, no six metaphors into an analogy in a gripping way.
[time=1988] Moffat has said that all of Sky land and sea has been ravaged to bring forth illustrations as to just what type of men these are.
[time=1998] What kind of men are they? Six metaphors do describe them.
[time=2003] The first thing he says is they are blemishes at your love feast. Now that word blemish is a good word.
[time=2010] It's often translated blemish or spot, but it's also translated in Greek literature as a rock, particularly a rock or a reef under the sea just below the surface of the water.
[time=2027] In fact, Homer and his Odysseus. You've heard of Ulysses. Homer wrote that story. He called him Odysseus.
[time=2034] Here was the part of the fleet driven upon the rocks and wrecked.
[time=2041] Remember the story as the sea picks up Ulysses boat and it drives it and it crashes it to the rocks?
[time=2047] That word Homer used for rocks is the word here rendered blemish.
[time=2052] Now there's a similarity between a blemish and a rock under the sea.
[time=2057] Most of us have suffered through those commercials about having perfect skin. None of us have it.
[time=2064] They get this announcer whose voice is three octaves lower in a piano and he tells you that you have a fate worse than death.
[time=2075] A blemish and probably there are only two solutions, his and beheading.
[time=2083] And you ought to buy this product that will take that blemish away.
[time=2088] Well that blemish is nothing more than an otherwise clear surface that underneath the skin there's a bump.
[time=2095] That's why the Greeks used that word to say underneath the surface of the clear water there's a rock.
[time=2104] And what he's going to do is he's going to give us six analogies.
[time=2108] He'll give us an image and an analogy.
[time=2111] The image is a rock under the sea.
[time=2114] The analogy is like a rock under the sea these false teachers present a hidden danger.
[time=2124] Rock under the sea till Ulysses it was a hidden danger.
[time=2129] In this church and in any church the hidden danger are false teachers.
[time=2136] False professors of Christ and not true possessors of him in their hearts.
[time=2144] As Jude wrote he was writing to an audience much like this, large crowd.
[time=2150] Many of which had clearly given their lives to Christ.
[time=2153] Many others of which have never fully surrendered to him and clearly received him a savior.
[time=2158] But the problem was then and the problem today is nobody wears the right hats.
[time=2164] You know the lone ranger you could always tell the lone ranger.
[time=2167] Good guys wore the white hats.
[time=2169] Bad guys always wore the black hats.
[time=2171] It was crystal clear.
[time=2173] But in Jude's congregation you couldn't tell one from another.
[time=2177] And in this church you can't tell one from another.
[time=2180] And the intimacy is there.
[time=2181] Jude says they're blemishes at your love feast.
[time=2184] They not only come in the crowd on the morning service they come to that church potluck dinner.
[time=2188] That's what a love feast was.
[time=2190] Everybody baked a dish or two and they brought it together.
[time=2193] They set it out and they shared it as a love feast.
[time=2196] We're going to have one of those on Thanksgiving Eve here on a Wednesday night.
[time=2199] Please bake pies.
[time=2200] That has nothing to do with Jude but just thought you'd like to know that.
[time=2205] But these guys they'll come on Thanksgiving night and they'll sit right next to you.
[time=2210] They'll share their food.
[time=2211] They'll share the conversation.
[time=2213] They'll go down to the communion service and the chapel.
[time=2216] They'll hold the cup.
[time=2217] They'll take the bread.
[time=2218] And you know what?
[time=2220] In their hearts they don't know Christ.
[time=2224] And in their life they don't follow Christ.
[time=2227] And in their true conviction they don't believe that he's the son of God.
[time=2231] But they'll join when in without quorum.
[time=2234] They'll be surprised.
[time=2236] They are hidden dangers.
[time=2238] The second thing that he says that the next illustration he gives is not only are they blemishes at your love feast, but they are shepherds.
[time=2247] Shepherds who feed only themselves.
[time=2255] As you read the 23rd Psalm you learn a great deal about shepherds and sheep.
[time=2260] The shepherd had two responsibilities, one he was to provide for the sheep, two he was to protect the sheep.
[time=2268] Remember the 23rd Psalm?
[time=2270] He leads me in green pastures.
[time=2272] That's provision of food.
[time=2274] He leads me beside still waters.
[time=2276] That's provision of nourishment of water.
[time=2281] He restores my soul.
[time=2284] That's provision of care and of safety.
[time=2287] He protects.
[time=2288] Yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=2291] I'll fear no evil.
[time=2292] Thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff.
[time=2295] They comfort me.
[time=2297] A shepherd was to provide and to protect for the sheep.
[time=2301] But here it says these shepherds, do they provide for the sheep?
[time=2305] No.
[time=2306] They use their position for their own advantage.
[time=2309] They feed no one.
[time=2311] They tend no sheep.
[time=2313] They care only for themselves.
[time=2316] There are two passages that I'm relatively certain were in the mind of Jude as he wrote.
[time=2324] One of these passages is Isaiah chapter 56 verse 10 through 12.
[time=2330] Listen to this.
[time=2332] Israel's watchmen are blind.
[time=2334] They lack knowledge.
[time=2336] Picture this fortified city.
[time=2338] There's a big tower position for a watchman and they send the only blind guy in the city up to keep an eye out for the approaching enemy.
[time=2345] Next analogy, they are dogs with mighty appetites.
[time=2351] Oh I skipped it.
[time=2352] I'm sorry.
[time=2353] They are mute dogs.
[time=2355] They cannot bark.
[time=2357] I kind of like a dog like that.
[time=2359] You know what's going on?
[time=2360] You know nothing comes out.
[time=2362] But if you got that mutt for a watch dog, that's not worth much.
[time=2366] You're sleeping the dogs in the bathroom.
[time=2368] Well you know nothing comes out.
[time=2371] And then verse 11, they are dogs with mighty appetites that never have enough.
[time=2378] Listen to this.
[time=2379] They are shepherds who lack understanding.
[time=2384] They turn to their own way.
[time=2386] Each seeks his own gain.
[time=2390] Come, each one cries.
[time=2393] Let me get wine.
[time=2396] Let us drink our fill of beer and tomorrow will be like today or even far better.
[time=2404] Shepherds who have neglected the flock, who don't care for them, who don't tend them, but simply use their position as opportunity for themselves.
[time=2413] Ezekiel chapter 34, even more compelling, even more indicting.
[time=2420] Ezekiel 34.
[time=2423] The word of the Lord came to me.
[time=2426] Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel.
[time=2432] Prophecy and say to them, this is what the Lord sovereign says.
[time=2439] Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only care for themselves.
[time=2446] Should not the shepherds take care of the flock?
[time=2450] You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals.
[time=2456] But you do not take care of the flock.
[time=2460] You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured.
[time=2464] You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost.
[time=2468] You have ruled them harshly and brutally.
[time=2473] So they were scattered because there was no shepherd.
[time=2479] And when they were scattered, they became food for the wild animals.
[time=2485] My sheep wander all over the mountains and on every high hill.
[time=2490] They are scattered over the whole earth and no one searched or looked for them.
[time=2498] Jude says these false teachers, they are not only hidden dangers.
[time=2506] They are selfish leaders.
[time=2509] They use their position, their power and their opportunity simply for themselves.
[time=2517] Like the shepherds of Israel, they feed no one.
[time=2520] They protect no one other than themselves.
[time=2524] What are these men like?
[time=2527] They're hidden dangers. They're selfish leaders.
[time=2532] One third lease is their clouds.
[time=2535] Clouds without water.
[time=2537] A picture of the forest fires that razed through California or Oregon.
[time=2544] Prayer from rain, wanting rain.
[time=2548] And then anticipate the joy when those forest fires and those homeowners see clouds coming.
[time=2557] But the clouds dissipate. They lift.
[time=2561] They're burned off in the rising temperature and they bring no rain.
[time=2567] They only bring empty promises.
[time=2573] Jude says that's what these false teachers are.
[time=2577] They are empty promises.
[time=2580] Peter picked up on this theme and second Peter, he was writing about the same false teachers.
[time=2585] And in chapter two, he says these words.
[time=2589] They promise them freedom.
[time=2593] Freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity.
[time=2600] For a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.
[time=2604] And that's what the false teachers, that's what the humanists, that's what the secularists are saying today.
[time=2610] Freedom, get away from God, get away from narrow Christianity of the Bible.
[time=2615] There's freedom to be had out there.
[time=2617] You know, with every promise of freedom, there's a dark side called bondage.
[time=2622] One commercial offers you freedom and it says with this freedom, you can master the possibilities with this little credit card.
[time=2632] You know what, you take that credit card, you're free. You can go out and get in charge of this.
[time=2636] You can buy that. You are absolutely free to the 30th of the month.
[time=2641] Then try to write them and say, I watched your advertisement, I promised freedom.
[time=2646] What's this bill? I just wanted the freedom. It's called bondage.
[time=2651] It's not freedom, a credit card never gives you freedom, it only gives you bondage.
[time=2657] Freedom for a moment, bondage later.
[time=2662] Somebody came along and said, it's your body, enjoy it.
[time=2667] Making your playground, experiment, indulge and enjoy the freedom.
[time=2673] You watched the news this week, I'm so thankful what Keith Richards brought to television.
[time=2678] ABC was not trying to teach the Bible, they weren't promoting religion, but in their series of articles on the affair.
[time=2685] Did you hear the testimonies of people on Friday night?
[time=2688] Nobody came in the end of this show and said, you've heard about the affair and I'm one of those people.
[time=2691] I want to tell you, it was great. You never said that.
[time=2694] You know what they said? I was miserable. I was in slavery.
[time=2699] It was terrible. It was the worst part of my life.
[time=2702] There's always a false teacher out there who will say, freedom. Go for it.
[time=2707] Someone's going to come up to you and say, you've got problems, man, I can tell you freedom, I can tell you.
[time=2711] You take this little cigarette, you twist it in both ends.
[time=2714] You stick one end in your mouth and you light it and you draw in real slow and you just try to hold your breath as long as you can and you let that get into your system.
[time=2723] All your problems will go away. You'll really be free.
[time=2727] You won't have any problems. Mike Warnke is a Christian.
[time=2730] Now he said, somebody told me that. I was down to the scourge.
[time=2734] I was two months behind my rent and my refrigerator was empty.
[time=2737] So I took them up on the offer of freedom and I smoked their grass and two weeks later I woke up.
[time=2743] I was four weeks behind my rent and somebody had stolen my refrigerator.
[time=2747] All that freedom doesn't make it any better.
[time=2752] Freedom. That's what the false teachers announced.
[time=2757] It's your thing, baby. Do what you want to do. You only go around once, man, grab all you can.
[time=2763] Freedom. You know what they are? They're clouds without rain. They are empty promises.
[time=2770] And Peter adds the insight. While they give you the promise of freedom, they only bring to you the bondage of your soul.
[time=2778] The next thing he says of them, they are trees, autumn trees.
[time=2786] You know why he uses the word autumn trees? Because that's the time the fruits on the trees.
[time=2793] But these autumn trees are trees without fruit. Why?
[time=2799] Because they're uprooted. They are twice dead.
[time=2803] I have a friend. He's got two apple trees.
[time=2809] He picked five bushels of apples from two trees. I have an apple tree.
[time=2818] My apples had a bad case of the punis. I didn't get a quart. I didn't get a pint.
[time=2826] There was about a half a pint worth of apples on my trees, and a prior claim was made by the worms.
[time=2833] My trees had no fruit. You know why?
[time=2838] My trees didn't get quite the attention that John's trees did.
[time=2843] John sprayed his trees every two weeks. He fertilized them, and he cared for them all year long.
[time=2852] I watered my trees every time it rained.
[time=2858] You know, trees need certain care to survive.
[time=2864] And most specifically, in order to survive, they have to be rooted, and they have to be rooted in good soil.
[time=2872] These men have no roots. Their roots aren't in God's word. Their roots are exposed.
[time=2878] They're dying, and they're fruitless.
[time=2884] These men have profession, but they have no fruit in their life.
[time=2888] They don't have the fruit of godliness. They don't have the fruit of others coming to Christ.
[time=2892] They are again empty barren promises.
[time=2897] In contrast to that, Psalm 1 says, "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,
[time=2903] nor sits in the seat of the scornful, nor stands in the way of sinners.
[time=2907] But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night,
[time=2913] and he is like a tree planted by rivers of water."
[time=2919] You want to see a tree that's growing. Look for one that's planted with deep roots where there's a lot of water.
[time=2925] These men were uprooted twice dead. Not sure what he means.
[time=2930] It may mean that they're spiritually dead. They don't know Christ, and they're eternally dead.
[time=2934] They'll never inherit eternal life.
[time=2937] It may be in their dead today because they bear no fruit, and with their roots exposed they'll be certainly dead tomorrow.
[time=2943] But he's just emphasizing the emptiness.
[time=2946] The fifth analogy, waves.
[time=2949] A number of times I've been to the ocean. I love to play in the waves.
[time=2953] I'm a pretty good swimmer, so I'm not intimidated by those waves.
[time=2957] We've gone to the Atlantic Ocean. We've been to the Gulf.
[time=2960] I love to go out on the raft and get in those waves.
[time=2963] They're four, six foot high. That's fun stuff.
[time=2966] I spent two days in Hawaii.
[time=2969] We went down to this place where you can snorkel and see all the fish, and I did that, and then over this side there were some waves.
[time=2975] I went to those waves. They're about 10 or 12 feet high.
[time=2979] I learned a lesson about waves.
[time=2982] Anytime they're bigger than you are, probably ought to stay away.
[time=2986] I got out in those waves, and that wave picked me up, and as it picked me up, I was loving it, and it threw me down, and that was a great feeling.
[time=2993] It didn't let me up, and that was not a good feeling.
[time=2997] That wave was pushing and pushing, and I suddenly discovered the power of a wave.
[time=3006] Jude says these men are powerful waves.
[time=3010] When you think about these men are these women, these influential people don't think they're powerless.
[time=3017] They've got power. They may be eloquent. They may be educated.
[time=3021] They may be sophisticated. They may be experts in various areas.
[time=3025] They've got great power, but what does their power produce? Nothing.
[time=3030] It's like a wave that's huge blown up by the sea in the time of a storm and it pummels down, and you know what it brings up?
[time=3037] It brings up all the seaweed, all the slime, all the muck.
[time=3041] That's a very technical word. You know, all the muck on the bottom of the ocean.
[time=3045] That's what he says here. "They are waves of the sea foaming up their shame."
[time=3051] A wave brings up the slime from the bottom, and these people, with all their liberal theology, all their liberal living, you know what they're doing? They're bringing up their own shame.
[time=3063] You know, we live in a time of shamelessness.
[time=3066] We live in a time of absolute absurdity when people actually boast and brag of their sinfulness.
[time=3075] Celebrities get on television and they speak flippantly of their materialism and their excessiveness and how they live an extravagant lifestyle and dispose of everything they don't want.
[time=3087] Others get on there and they extol the virtues of their virtuousness and they flaunt their morality and they boast of it.
[time=3097] And what they are is they're powerful people who bring up their own shame.
[time=3102] Finally, he says they are stars, but wandering stars.
[time=3108] I was in the Boy Scouts, and in the Boy Scouts, one of the things they taught you to use
[time=3114] was the North Star.
[time=3116] And whenever you know where the North Star is, you can always determine North, South, and East, and West, and you can get your bearings.
[time=3125] You know why the North Star is so helpful? It never moves.
[time=3130] It is always in the same place, the North.
[time=3134] But if the North Star moved around, it would be worthless to us.
[time=3139] Because you have to have a fixed point of reference,
[time=3145] a fixed point of reference to establish all other coordinates and movements.
[time=3151] He said these men are stars, they're alike, you see them.
[time=3155] But they're not a fixed point, they're a wandering star.
[time=3159] They're always moving, they're relative in their theology, they're relative in their values.
[time=3164] There are no absolutes to them.
[time=3167] If it feels good, do it.
[time=3169] It's your thing, baby, do what you want to do.
[time=3172] And he speaks of their aimless guidance.
[time=3176] And then this graphic illustration, he says, they are wandering stars, bright lights for whom is reserved, the blackest starfulness judgment.
[time=3190] Before we get into that, the judgment, just listen to these analogies.
[time=3196] These men are called lifeless, hidden stones, and believers in Christ are called living stones built upon the rock of Jesus.
[time=3204] Wasn't that a great him or choir saying, the rock of faith is Jesus?
[time=3209] And you can be built on him as a living stone, not a hidden rock.
[time=3216] These men were self-serving shepherds.
[time=3219] 1 Peter chapter 5 tells us that we can be Jesus Christ under shepherds, feeding the flock, not just me as a pastor, but you as you share God's word in a whole Bible study. As you share Christ with a friend, as you go out on a visitation team as you talk over a lunch break, you can be the very under shepherds of God.
[time=3241] These men were called waterless crowds, but Jesus said, "He that comes unto me out of him will burst forth "founds of living water." John chapter 7 verse 37, "For you will spring forth the waters of life." These men were called dead trees, and Jesus said, "You are my living branches.
[time=3263] "I am the vine, and you are the branches, and if you abide in me, "you will bear much fruit." These men were dead barren trees.
[time=3274] These men were raging waves of the sea.
[time=3279] Isaiah chapter 48, listen to this, Isaiah chapter 48, verse 18, tells us in contrast to these raging waves of the sea, what you can be.
[time=3292] If only you pay attention to my commands, your peace will be peace like a river. That's where we got that children's song.
[time=3300] Peace like a river, joy like a fountain, love like an ocean in my soul.
[time=3305] God says, "If you follow me, you are a peace like a river, "and your righteousness like the waves of the sea." Not forming up shame, but powerful men and women of character and substance. These men were wandering stars, and Daniel 12 said, "You'll be God's stars of righteousness." You'll be alike to this world. Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5, "You are the light of the world." These men were wandering stars, but you and I can be a beacon for Christ today.
[time=3338] What were these false teachers?
[time=3342] They were hidden rocks, unseen dangers. They were unfaithful shepherds, selfish leaders.
[time=3354] They were waterless clouds and deep promises. They were fruitless trees and barren professions.
[time=3366] They were foaming waves, wasted energy, wandering stars, and endless guides. And for this God says, "I reserve for you the blackest judgment." He goes on to explain that.
[time=3386] Verse 14, he says, "The seventh from Enoch prophesied about these men." Adam, seven generations out of the chronology of Genesis, we come to Enoch, a righteous man. We have not the writings of Enoch. They were passed down by oral tradition, from father to son, from generation to generation.
[time=3406] Over the years, much of them were retained, but amongst them were mingled in some air. And so they're not a part of God's inspired writings, but Jude was aware of these oral traditions that had been, in part, penned by others. And one of the things that was true that came by way of oral tradition was this prophecy, "The Lord is coming. He will judge, and he will execute justice." Verse 14 tells us three things, and verse 15 as well, about what these men will face. They will face justice. He says it's foretold. Enoch told it eternity ago, it's future. Jesus is coming again with those who believe his saints, thousands and thousands of his holy ones, and it is not only future, it's for justice. He will judge all men, and he'll separate the sheep from the goats, the real ones who know Christ from the false ones who don't, and he will judge them for their ungodliness, the ungodly deeds they have done, the ungodly words they have spoken. Why is he going to do that?
[time=3474] Five reasons. Verse 16.
[time=3478] They are grumblers. They are fault finders.
[time=3482] They're hedonistic. They follow their own evil desires. They're boastful.
[time=3486] They brag about themselves. They flatter others only for their own advantage.
[time=3490] The bottom line, they don't know Christ to you.
[time=3504] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from Lynn
[time=3512] Rolle and our ensemble celebration, and then the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks. Just a few moments ago Rick talked to you about a lady that accepted Jesus Christ as a result of the Bible out. If you have a need today for Christ to come into your heart, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3532] And pray with me, won't you? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this day, and I thank you for the Holy Spirit helping me to see the need that I need Christ as my Savior.
[time=3544] And today I ask you to come into my heart and forgive me to cleanse me of the sins that I've committed. In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3552] Amen. If you prayed this prayer today, would you write us and let us know that you've made a decision for Jesus Christ.
[time=3560] And today we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Your Decision to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
