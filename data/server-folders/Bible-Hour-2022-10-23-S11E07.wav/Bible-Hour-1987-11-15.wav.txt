[time=106] In studying this past week, I read an article that described the history of the Great Wall of China.
[time=113] That perimeter wall that protected from invasion to the north in the centuries of its existence had only been crossed by the enemy three times.
[time=123] And each of those three times, the enemy was able to cross the Great Wall because a guard had been bribed.
[time=133] Defection and dereliction of duty, the surest way to defeat.
[time=140] [dramatic music]
[time=150] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=156] We're glad you joined us.
[time=158] Rick's message today is entitled "Parching Orders" and is taken from the New Testament Book of Jude.
[time=165] In war, both physical and spiritual, faithfulness and steadfastness are essential for victory.
[time=171] Defection and dereliction of duty are the surest way to defeat.
[time=176] We are at war.
[time=178] We live life on a spiritual battlefield.
[time=181] Paul called us to be good soldiers in Second Timothy.
[time=184] Ephesians reminds us of our spiritual armor.
[time=188] Jude issues our marching orders.
[time=190] That is the theme and title of today's message, "Marching Orders." We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study with us.
[time=200] We will be looking at Jude, verses 17 through 23.
[time=204] Our special music today includes a song from the sanctuary choir, Susan Twirang, and Keith Brodigum.
[time=214] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen in this station each week at this time.
[time=223] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=228] Now, here's Rick.
[time=230] Today, we today have come to worship the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=237] the name that is above every name, the name of Jesus.
[time=241] We hope today in your heart you've come to worship Him and to praise Him and to give Him the glory.
[time=247] We welcome you this morning and also want to greet our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=254] This service is dedicated as always to giving God the glory and our choir leads us with a medley of songs that speak of the glory of God.
[time=264] Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel, our Father forever and ever,
[time=276] thine, O Lord, is the power and the glory and the majesty, for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine.
[time=284] Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all, both riches and honor come of thee.
[time=292] And in thine hand, it is to make great and to give strength unto all.
[time=297] Therefore, God, we thank thee and praise thy glorious men.
[time=328] I will call upon the light.
[time=331] I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be through His words to me.
[time=337] So shall I be saved, shall I be saved from my enemies?
[time=343] O Lord, give us a blessing, O Lord, give us a blessing, O Lord,
[time=363] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever I will sing.
[time=370] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
[time=448] He has made me glad, He has made me glad, I will rejoice for He has made me glad, He has made me glad, I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
[time=466] Pray them, my dear, is the Lord our God. Pray them, my dear, is He. Pray them, my dear, is the Lord our God. Pray them, my dear, is He.
[time=481] Lift up your banner, let the anthem ring. Pray them to our King. Pray them, my dear, is the Lord our God. Pray them, my dear, is He.
[time=495] To God in the glory, Pray them to His God. So love with the world that He gave us His Son.
[time=512] Who kneel, there is life and a toner for sin and hope and the life in them all came away.
[time=528] There's the Lord, there's the Lord, that the earth give His voice. There's the Lord, there's the Lord.
[time=540] Let the people rejoice, it comes to the Father who teaches us the Son and give Him the glory.
[time=557] Give Him the glory, give Him the glory. Pray them.
[time=568] Give Him the glory.
[time=581] [APPLAUSE]
[time=588] So often when he's singing a song that talks about the goodness of the Lord and the great things He's done,
[time=594] we're aware too that there are some very distinct problems among families in our church and tragedy has struck them.
[time=603] But we can still thank the Lord that He's there beside us, leading us and guiding us and continuing to help us in those tragedies and circumstances that come our way
[time=613] despite the fact that God still loves us, those things are not taken from our lives down here. He leads us. What a blessed thought today that no matter what our circumstances are today,
[time=625] God is there directing in the affairs of our lives. Him number 580 will sing the first, second and fourth stanzas together.
[time=634] [MUSIC - 385 seconds]
[time=1036] Each service that we have the opportunity to share with you, while the announcements and offering are going on here at Blackhawk,
[time=1043] we want to take these few moments to talk directly with you friends who join us by way of television. So Pete and I are here today encouraging you to join us for this year's living Christmas tree. And yesterday the tickets became available to the general public, and many of the concerts are already gone.
[time=1061] Now Rick, yesterday I was at a conference since I was unable to be here for that, but that isn't always an exciting morning, and I'm certain that there were a number of people that watched the Bible Hour that came yesterday for tickets,
[time=1072] and I hope you got exactly those tickets that you needed. If you want living Christmas tree tickets and you'd like to know the dates that are still available, Rick, they can call the church office during the week, Monday through Friday, from 8.30 to 5, and there will be people on duty who will assist you in letting you know the tickets that are still available for living Christmas tree. And we would invite you to call, and when you call, we would be happy to reserve tickets for you.
[time=1099] So if you call on Monday and they tell you there are tickets for a particular concert, they'll hold those for you until you can come pick those up. But we can only hold those for one week, is that right? And then if you don't pick them up within a week's time in order to be fair and equitable, we need to give others a chance for tickets as well.
[time=1117] So we do want to encourage you to call, and we'll save tickets for you so you can come pick those up. Because of our limited office staff and limited time, we cannot take mail order requests, but we will reserve them for a week if you'll call. What number should they call?
[time=1132] The area code is 219-749-8524. Once again, the area code is 219-749-8524. One of the privileges of the living Christmas tree is we often have the opportunity of meeting many friends like you who watch the Bible hour, and this is our first time to meet face to face.
[time=1156] Last night, Pete, I was speaking for Youth for Christ in Defiance, Ohio. It was a great night, and one of the highlights for me was after it was all over a number of people came up and said that they regularly watch us on the Bible hour.
[time=1169] Most of them said before they went to church, others confessed that they probably should have been at church on that Sunday, and we scolded them and said, "Get to church."
[time=1177] Rick, that's encouraging, and during this last week, I received a letter from an 88-year-old lady in Marion Springs, Michigan, and we were just delighted that she mentioned in her letter that there were a number of ladies that watched the Bible hour in that area, and that's always an encouragement to us when you write, and just let us know that you do watch in your blessed fire ministry.
[time=1197] Well, we would like to encourage you to write and not only tell us how God has used the Bible hour in your life spiritually, but we'd encourage you to write and ask for a booklet that we've been using as we've studied through the Book of Jude.
[time=1210] It's a pamphlet entitled "The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air." This helpful little publication comes to us from Moody Press and gives us an overview of both what the Scripture teach and then what the cults teach on several key issues of the Scriptures.
[time=1228] What does the Bible say about Jesus Christ? What do the cults say about Him? What does the Bible say about salvation? What do the false teachers say?
[time=1238] What does the Bible say about God? What do the false teachers say? And these are days of great deception, days when even true Christians could be easily misled if they're not rooted in God's Word.
[time=1253] We've studied through the Book of James. We saw a few months ago the pointed teaching about faith and works. Now we're in the Book of Jude, and Jude gives us clear warning and a clear call to the battlefront. This pamphlet I know will help you to understand the Scriptures and our faith in Christ better. And if you'll write, we'll send you a copy free.
[time=1274] We encourage you to write today to the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1292] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today. We trust that God will use this hour to build you up in your faith and strengthen your convictions that you are called to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
[time=1305] And I hope today that if you've never enlisted in God's army, you'll surrender to Him and become a soldier of Christ. Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1322] A wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord. A wonderful Savior to me.
[time=1345] He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, Where rivers of pleasure I see.
[time=1358] He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, That shadows a dry thirsty land.
[time=1371] He hideth my life in the depths of his love, And covers me there with his hand.
[time=1387] And covers me there with his hand. A wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord.
[time=1402] He takeeth my burden away. He holdeth me up, And I shall not be old. He giveeth me strength as my day.
[time=1422] He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, That shadows a dry thirsty land.
[time=1435] He hideth my life in the depths of his love, And covers me there with his hand.
[time=1451] And covers me there with his hand.
[time=1465] So safe to the rock that is higher than I, My soul in its conflict, and sorrows would fly.
[time=1487] So sinful, so weary, Thy kind would I be.
[time=1500] Thou blessed rock of ages, I'm hiding in thee.
[time=1514] I'm hiding in thee.
[time=1526] Thou blessed rock of ages, I'm hiding in thee.
[time=1540] He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, That shadows a dry thirsty land.
[time=1554] He hideth my life in the depths of his love.
[time=1567] And covers me there with his hand, And covers me there with his hand.
[time=1595] Thank you, Keith. I invite you to pray with me.
[time=1602] God, we come to you today because we sense that this very hour in this place for many of us is that cleft in the rock.
[time=1613] This is a place of spiritual rest, a fortress, a place of security.
[time=1621] God, many this week have gone through some hours of loneliness and grief that are undescribable.
[time=1629] Others have gone through moments of rejection and of emotional pain that cannot be told.
[time=1638] Others have felt the long term sting of resentment, and God, we today come to you for healing and for restoration and for newness of life.
[time=1652] God, we ask you to put your hand over us and to do two things, Lord.
[time=1659] We ask you to convict us of our own sinfulness and draw out the venom of our own poison.
[time=1666] And then secondly, God, to give us the grace to accept the wounds that are inflicted upon us by others.
[time=1675] Father, today, we come to you as our cleft in the rock and our hiding place.
[time=1682] We pray particularly for Mary Kay Siglin in the death of her father, and Dennis Stull in the loss of his mother, that you might comfort and encourage them.
[time=1694] Father, today, we would pray for those who are ill and who are suffering.
[time=1700] We pray for Marv Deggitts and Elsie Saylor, Little Tate Studie, Mrs. Haberly.
[time=1709] God, today, we pray for those who are lonely, for Mrs. Snyder, in her senior years, battling arthritis.
[time=1718] God, that you might give to her with each day a measure of grace.
[time=1723] Father, we pray for our youth today that they would grow with conviction, that there would be purposefulness in their heart to walk in your word.
[time=1735] We pray for young men and young women that they'll find value and obedience to you.
[time=1741] God, help each of us to know that the Word of God is not given to stifle or delimit, but to direct and create opportunities out of purity.
[time=1751] Father, today, as we come to your Word, we submit ourselves to you and to the instruction of your scriptures.
[time=1759] We ask you to teach today, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1766] Do you recall these famous words out of American historical literature?
[time=1772] Listen, my children, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, one of my lay and two of my sea,
[time=1781] and I on the opposite shore shall be ready and willing to make my ride.
[time=1787] Do you remember those words?
[time=1789] The words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow as he spoke of the famous midnight ride of Paul Revere.
[time=1797] It took place on an April night in 1775.
[time=1801] The American colonies had given their statement to England that they would not pay taxes on tea.
[time=1809] They would not pay a stamp act tax.
[time=1812] There were hostilities that were brewing, and there was an expected invasion of British army, and a warning needed to be sounded.
[time=1822] And so the plan was arranged that in Old North Church, one man would go into the tower of the church with a lantern,
[time=1830] and he would flash across the river and bay a signal.
[time=1834] If he flashed the light one time, the British were coming by land.
[time=1844] Across on the opposite shore was Paul Revere.
[time=1849] And Paul Revere was to make his ride to give warning to every village in the outskirts of Boston that the British were coming.
[time=1860] We know about Old North Church. We know about Paul Revere who made the ride, but does your mind remind you to whom did he give the warning?
[time=1871] Do you remember?
[time=1873] Paul Revere's ride was not a ride to take the message from Boston to the army of the United States.
[time=1882] There wasn't one.
[time=1884] There was no army.
[time=1886] Paul Revere made his ride from Boston to the outskirts.
[time=1891] He was warning farmers. He was warning blacksmiths.
[time=1895] He was warning wheelwrights. He was warning those who made carts.
[time=1900] He was warning housewives and mothers and schoolteachers.
[time=1903] He was warning printers and shop owners, because you see the military force of the United States was not made up of a formal militia.
[time=1913] They were made up of people who in a minute's notice were ready to fight and they were called minute men.
[time=1921] They weren't trained soldiers. They didn't have uniforms. They weren't issued government rifles.
[time=1927] They were everyday citizens who were minute men who in a moment's notice were ready to serve and to fight.
[time=1939] I believe the scriptures tell us that we are engaged in spiritual warfare and we are to be God's minute men.
[time=1948] If you have a Bible today, open it please to the Book of Jude.
[time=1951] Jude is that next to last Book of the Bible that we've been studying here for four or five weeks.
[time=1957] We're today coming to June chapter 1 verses 17 through 23.
[time=1964] These few verses give us our marching orders.
[time=1968] But let me take this opportunity while you're finding Jude to give you an overview of the entire book so it might make sense.
[time=1977] In Jude 1 and 2 verses 1 and 2 he gives us the introduction to his letter.
[time=1985] It's very typical. It's typical most of the New Testament letters.
[time=1989] It's typical of the way epistles were written in those days.
[time=1993] It begins with a short introduction, identifying the author, identifying the recipients and a brief word of greeting.
[time=2001] Mercy, peace and love. That's an introduction.
[time=2005] Then verse 3 gives to us the thesis, the principle, the occasion why Jude was writing.
[time=2015] He said, "Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write to you to encourage you to contend for the faith."
[time=2031] That's what Jude is all about. It is a letter written calling Christians to contend for the faith.
[time=2039] Now, if you've been studying with us these past weeks, you may recall what that word "contend" was in the Greek language.
[time=2046] It was a Greek word that sounds like this. Agonidzomai.
[time=2051] We shorten the first part of it down and you come up with Agoni.
[time=2056] It meant someone who was fighting, who was striving, who was contending to the very point of agony.
[time=2065] It was used of the athlete who out of sheer discipline and determination would extend themselves physically and agonize in an attempt to contend to compete.
[time=2078] But it was more often used of the soldier who would march in the battle and who would not stop until duty was fulfilled and he would agonize in battle.
[time=2090] That's the occasion of this letter calling believers in Christ to stand and to root themselves to be built up for battle to contend for the faith.
[time=2102] When you follow verse 3, verses 4 through verses 16 are like one giant parenthetical statement.
[time=2111] And that statement is a lengthy description of the false teachers against whom Jude calls us to contend.
[time=2121] That's parenthetical. He calls us to contend. He describes the enemy as not till you get to verse 17 that he gives the marching orders.
[time=2132] He summons us to battle. The bugle has sounded a symbol, but the orders haven't been given yet.
[time=2140] Verse 17 gives us the orders. I'm going to read verses 17 through 23 for you in my translation, the new international version.
[time=2149] It reads, "But dear friends, remember with the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
[time=2158] They said to you, in the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.
[time=2171] These are the men who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the spirit.
[time=2182] But you dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.
[time=2194] Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
[time=2204] Be merciful to those who doubt. Snatch others from the fire and save them to others. Show mercy with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupt flesh."
[time=2225] Marching orders, a pistol that's given a call to assemble, to contend for the faith, and now the marching orders.
[time=2234] It'll take us two weeks to complete the study of these verses that we've just read.
[time=2239] But just so it all fits together in your mind, I see here three marching orders that Jude gives.
[time=2245] Allow me to give them to you right now. Marching order number one, remember the Word of God.
[time=2251] I find that in verses 17, 18, 19, and 20 it begins, but dear friends remember what the apostles of our Lord said.
[time=2262] Remember what has been said in God's Word. That's marching order number one.
[time=2267] Marching order number two is found in verse 21.
[time=2271] Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2277] Marching order number two, remain steadfast.
[time=2282] Remain steadfast. Keep yourself.
[time=2287] Marching order number three, rescue the casualties, verses 22 and 23.
[time=2296] Be merciful to those who doubt. Snatch others from the fire and save them to others. Show mercy mixed with fear.
[time=2304] Remember the Word of God. Remain steadfast. Rescue the casualties.
[time=2312] Those are the marching orders that he gives to the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2317] Not just to those original recipients, but I believe just as certainly the scriptures were given for our edification and instruction today.
[time=2328] These are marching orders for Blackhawk Baptist Church. These are marching orders for you as an individual.
[time=2336] These are marching orders for me, not by position as pastor, but by person believer in Jesus Christ.
[time=2343] God's instructions to us today.
[time=2347] This morning we'll look at the first. Remember God's Word.
[time=2352] In this short paragraph, remembering God's Word is going to inform us about the enemy and instruct us as his army.
[time=2361] Verse 17, that information about the enemy.
[time=2365] But dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
[time=2373] They said to you, "In the last time, there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires."
[time=2382] He said, "Remember God's Word what was stated prophetically."
[time=2388] Now you've heard me say many times that Jude uses threes.
[time=2392] Three times Jude references prophecy about false teachers. This is the third of those.
[time=2399] Way back in verse four, the very first time he mentions the false teachers, he stated.
[time=2405] For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago.
[time=2410] As Jude brings to the foreground certain false teachers, he said it was foretold long ago their condemnation was given.
[time=2418] Then in verse 14 he says, "An Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied saying to you,
[time=2427] the Lord is coming with his thousands upon thousands to judge all men and to convict the ungodly.
[time=2435] For all the ungodly things, they've got a second prophecy about false teachers.
[time=2440] And now we come to verse 17, remember the apostles of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2446] Three prophecies, three times he alludes to the false teachers and said, but it was foretold.
[time=2452] Why does he do that? Jesus tells us why.
[time=2457] Let's keep your bulletin or our finger here and turn to John's gospel, John chapter 16.
[time=2463] And in John 14, 15 and 16, Jesus is prophetically teaching his disciples.
[time=2471] He's telling them about his own death, about his resurrection.
[time=2475] He's telling them that God's going to send the Holy Spirit.
[time=2478] It's all prophecy, chapter 16, verse 1.
[time=2483] All this I've told you so that you will not go astray.
[time=2488] They will put you out of the synagogue.
[time=2491] In fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God.
[time=2501] They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.
[time=2506] I have told you this so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you.
[time=2515] Jesus said the whole purpose of prophecy to the church is so that you and so that I will know in advance,
[time=2523] so when all of these things will happen we won't go, I can't believe this is happening.
[time=2530] We're told in advance.
[time=2532] We should not be surprised that as Christians we are called to suffer for Christ's sake.
[time=2537] Now we live in a very secure culture.
[time=2539] We live in this country with its Judeo-historic background.
[time=2543] There is not great outward persecution of Christianity.
[time=2546] There is an Ethiopia today.
[time=2548] There is behind the iron curtain today.
[time=2551] There is behind that bamboo curtain today, physical persecution for Christ.
[time=2556] Maybe Jesus was speaking to the Apostle Paul and he said there will be some who think they are doing God a favor by persecuting Christians.
[time=2564] Paul was such a one.
[time=2565] He went about trying to stamp out Christianity.
[time=2569] I thought he was doing God a service.
[time=2572] Jesus said I am telling you these things so that when you encounter persecution you won't say I can't believe God is letting this happen to me.
[time=2580] You should say I believe God is letting this happen to me because he told me it is going to happen.
[time=2585] You and I may today not face that physical persecution but we may face great social persecution.
[time=2593] Many of you have gone through separation in your family because you came to Christ and your mother or your father.
[time=2599] They didn't understand that.
[time=2601] They felt rejection and so they rejected you.
[time=2604] If you join that church we won't speak to you again.
[time=2608] Some of you have been shunned by your friends in the office.
[time=2613] You have gotten too religious for them and they really like to give that social dig.
[time=2619] They love to say loud enough that they are not talking to you but loud enough you will hear it.
[time=2624] Just a little comment to make you as uncomfortable and miserable as possible.
[time=2628] Don't be surprised at that.
[time=2630] Jesus said you will suffer that.
[time=2632] Judas said don't be surprised when you look across the pew across the auditorium.
[time=2638] You say I know that guy.
[time=2640] He's a crook.
[time=2642] And he sits over this hymn book singing holy holy holy.
[time=2646] The guy rips people off.
[time=2648] Judas says don't be surprised at that.
[time=2651] I know her.
[time=2652] I know what she's like.
[time=2654] How can she come and play the part?
[time=2657] Judas said don't be surprised.
[time=2659] Three times.
[time=2661] God gave prophecy that these things would happen.
[time=2667] That's what our information about the enemy is.
[time=2669] They're foretold.
[time=2671] Three times.
[time=2672] Then if you'll look on it says it was told by the apostles of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2677] We read about Enoch last week.
[time=2679] God gave prophecy to Enoch.
[time=2681] It was never recorded, inspired recorded.
[time=2684] But by oral tradition it had been passed down.
[time=2688] But now he says the apostles of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2691] What is he referring to?
[time=2693] He's at least referring to these two.
[time=2695] Paul and Peter.
[time=2698] Paul wrote prior to Jude to Timothy.
[time=2701] And in 1 Timothy chapter 4 he said in the end times teachers will come teaching seductive, seducing doctrine.
[time=2710] Now what is a seductive doctrine?
[time=2712] It's a doctrine that when somebody hears it they say I like that.
[time=2716] I can live by that.
[time=2718] Matter of fact that's the way I've always wanted to live.
[time=2720] And I finally found a church that says go ahead and do what you want to do.
[time=2724] Seductive doctrines.
[time=2727] Paul was an apostle of Jesus who foretold that.
[time=2730] Peter said the same thing.
[time=2732] And what Jude is writing here closely parallels 2 Peter chapter 2.
[time=2738] It was written by the apostles.
[time=2740] And these apostles wrote and said there would come in the last times scoffers.
[time=2746] What is a scoffer?
[time=2749] A scoffer is not only one who says I don't believe that.
[time=2755] I don't live that way.
[time=2757] It's someone who comes this far and says I don't really believe that.
[time=2760] But isn't that the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard?
[time=2762] I mean you want a good laugh.
[time=2764] Look at those Christians.
[time=2765] I mean you talk about dumb.
[time=2767] Dumb is a Christian.
[time=2769] Dumb is those ignorant people who said Jesus is coming again.
[time=2773] Oh really?
[time=2774] What day is he coming?
[time=2776] We've heard for years Jesus is coming again.
[time=2780] It's 1987.
[time=2782] You've been saying Jesus is coming again forever.
[time=2786] Where is he?
[time=2787] I'll wait.
[time=2788] Jesus, come in.
[time=2789] He scoffed at that.
[time=2791] That's what Peter said.
[time=2792] scoffers would come saying that you've been saying that he is coming but he is not.
[time=2797] And they ridicule that.
[time=2799] scoffers are the ones that say those foolish Christians.
[time=2802] They could be enjoying life.
[time=2804] They could be living in the fast lane.
[time=2806] You know there are more accidents in the fast lane than anywhere else.
[time=2809] They could be living in the fast lane just like I am.
[time=2814] But no, that's a scoffer.
[time=2817] One who not only refuses to believe but ridicules and tries to dissuade others from falling.
[time=2823] He said don't be surprised.
[time=2825] There will be scoffers in the last time.
[time=2827] And notice how he describes them.
[time=2829] scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.
[time=2834] Guess how many times he said their own ungodly desires?
[time=2840] If you said three, you're right.
[time=2842] This is the third time Jude has referenced the fact that they live by their appetite.
[time=2848] Verse four, he says these men they've crept in secretly among you.
[time=2852] They are ungodly men who take the grace of God and use it as a license.
[time=2858] Use it as a permission slip.
[time=2861] This is deer hunting season now in Indiana.
[time=2863] I saw that on the news.
[time=2865] And if you have a license that gives you permission.
[time=2868] You can go out and shoot a buck.
[time=2869] I can't do that.
[time=2871] I don't have a license.
[time=2872] These guys were saying you want permission to go live in morally.
[time=2876] Here it is.
[time=2877] God's grace.
[time=2878] You want permission to sleep around.
[time=2880] Here it is.
[time=2881] God's grace.
[time=2882] You want permission to live any way you want to at the expense of others.
[time=2887] God's grace.
[time=2888] There's your permission slip.
[time=2889] There's your license.
[time=2890] He not only says it there but look at verse 16.
[time=2893] He says these men are grumblers.
[time=2897] They are fault finders.
[time=2900] They follow their own evil desire.
[time=2905] That's the second time.
[time=2907] And now verse 18 these scoffers who follow their own ungodly desires.
[time=2917] Now to supplement that statement he gives three more descriptions.
[time=2923] There are lots of threes here.
[time=2928] He says these are the men who divide you.
[time=2931] Secondly these are the men who follow mere natural instincts.
[time=2936] And thirdly these are men who have not the spirit.
[time=2941] He said these men the influence of them on the body of Christ is they divide it.
[time=2947] They separate it.
[time=2948] They form schisms.
[time=2949] They get this group against that group.
[time=2952] It's constant division.
[time=2955] Secondly he puts things in contrast.
[time=2959] They are naturally gifted and follow those instincts.
[time=2965] And thirdly they do not have the spirit.
[time=2968] What I think he's saying here is these ungodly men have great ability by natural instincts.
[time=2976] We might say they have great charisma on their strong natural leaders.
[time=2982] I like history.
[time=2984] As you go back and you study history you find that at various times in our history there were great natural leaders who had tremendous communication ability.
[time=2995] In 1960 J.F.K. was elected president of the United States.
[time=3001] He was articulate.
[time=3003] He was bold.
[time=3005] He was daring.
[time=3006] He was decisive.
[time=3007] And he had great natural ability.
[time=3010] I can remember I was only a sixth grader but I could hear the words of J.F.K.
[time=3015] Ask not what your country can do for you.
[time=3019] But rather ask what you can do for your country.
[time=3023] Eloquent man.
[time=3024] Natural gifted leader.
[time=3026] Now I'm not trying to ridicule but think of the next presidents.
[time=3030] LBJ.
[time=3031] Here's LBJ.
[time=3035] When he turned on we turned off the TV set and my fellow Americans.
[time=3039] I mean you know just sadness swept across the nation.
[time=3044] And then it's been that way until Reagan.
[time=3047] We now have a president who's a communicator.
[time=3051] These men had natural ability.
[time=3053] They were a J.F.K.
[time=3054] They were a Ronald Reagan.
[time=3056] They were people with great natural ability.
[time=3058] There's not anything wrong with having great natural ability.
[time=3061] Those guys were so gifted speakers they could even get all their hours out without rolling.
[time=3066] They could say Ronald Reagan.
[time=3068] Ronald Reagan.
[time=3072] Natural ability.
[time=3074] They had it.
[time=3076] But you know what?
[time=3077] They didn't have the spirit of God.
[time=3080] They didn't have the Holy Spirit as their enablement.
[time=3083] And what they said simply came out of their own resources and didn't come by the Spirit of God.
[time=3088] But they were effective because they were intelligent.
[time=3092] They were gifted.
[time=3094] They were articulate.
[time=3095] They were persuasive.
[time=3098] But they didn't have the Spirit of God.
[time=3100] You know there are many quote ministries to date that are a success in terms of the amount of people who are involved.
[time=3108] They're successful in terms of their magnificent facilities or their budget.
[time=3113] And all the standards by which we think success maybe should be measured, they are successful.
[time=3119] But you know what?
[time=3120] They may not have the Spirit of God.
[time=3122] They may just have this natural ability.
[time=3126] They may do it in the name of ministry, but it may be simply born along by vigor and vitality that comes out of the natural personality.
[time=3135] Let me give you three tests.
[time=3138] These are not rising out of the text.
[time=3140] These are my opinion.
[time=3141] I think they're biblical.
[time=3142] I'm sure they're not under biblical.
[time=3144] Three tests so that you can measure a ministry.
[time=3147] Is it simply natural ability or is it born by the Spirit of God?
[time=3151] Test number one.
[time=3152] Who gets the glory?
[time=3154] When you watch that television ministry, when you read those publications, when you hear those speakers,
[time=3160] is it hooray for our leader?
[time=3163] He is the greatest.
[time=3164] Look at what this guy doesn't look what she can do.
[time=3167] Or does the glory go to God?
[time=3170] Who's exalted?
[time=3172] Who is magnified?
[time=3173] I think of John the Baptist.
[time=3175] John the Baptist disciples came in and said, "Hey, John, we've got a problem." John said, "What's that?" Well, it's Jesus.
[time=3183] All the people who used to follow us, they're following Jesus.
[time=3187] "We better get our act together." John said, "No, this was my purpose.
[time=3195] To prepare the way for him, and he must increase, and I must decrease."
[time=3203] Well, the greatest test you can ever give of a ministry is who's exalted, who is magnified.
[time=3210] What name is lifted up?
[time=3212] Who gets the glory?
[time=3213] Test number two is the emphasis on edification or entertainment.
[time=3220] Now, I'm not putting down things that entertain.
[time=3223] I love to be entertained.
[time=3225] There are times when I go to a concert because I like that music.
[time=3228] It's Christian music, but I made you say it's entertainment.
[time=3231] We've got tapes.
[time=3232] You know Kathy, she's like, "We've got tapes coming out of the house." And a lot of it, I just listened to them for entertainment.
[time=3239] I was driving to defiance last night, and I put in this tape of a group called First Call, and I was just entertained.
[time=3246] I wasn't trying to get great ministry out of this tape.
[time=3250] I was trying to get 50 miles down on the highway on US 24 without being in misery.
[time=3256] It was entertainment.
[time=3258] There's not anything wrong with that, but you know, ministry's got to be more than entertainment.
[time=3263] It's got to be more than all that hour went by fast.
[time=3266] Church used to be a drag, but now it's pretty entertaining.
[time=3269] It's got to be edification.
[time=3272] The end of it all ought to say, "Maybe I did enjoy that.
[time=3275] Maybe I was entertained." But my faith was challenged.
[time=3278] I now know the depth of God's word.
[time=3280] There was meat, and I ate it, and I'm stronger for it.
[time=3284] There's a ministry only entertain you.
[time=3286] There's only give sensational reports as it actually builds you up in the food of God's word.
[time=3293] Test number three is the emphasis on human success on service for Christ.
[time=3299] Does the ministry say you need to become an ambassador for Christ and to serve Him?
[time=3306] Or does the ministry say, "Hey, hit your wagon to this star because you'll really be successful.
[time=3311] You want to make some money, reach into God's goody bag.
[time=3314] He'll give you prestige, he'll give you power, he'll give you pleasure.
[time=3318] Come take from God.
[time=3320] He'll make you successful." Those are three good tests that distinguish between the natural and the spiritual.
[time=3327] The natural gives glory to the leader, the spiritual gives glory to God.
[time=3331] The natural says, "We'll entertain Him." The spiritual says, "We'll build them up, we'll edify Him." The natural says, "It's success for you." The spiritual says, "We'll serve the King." Well, that's all information about the enemy.
[time=3344] Now here's instruction for the believer.
[time=3347] Remember God's word to instructions, build yourself up.
[time=3354] I'm so thankful.
[time=3356] It gets me off the hook.
[time=3358] It doesn't say, "Pastor, you build them up." It says, "You build yourself up.
[time=3365] Beloved, I'll be faithful to you.
[time=3367] I'll study God's word.
[time=3369] And I'll do everything I can to be prepared and to teach it, not only academics, but to teach it as it relates to life and to illustrate it as best I can." But that's the end of my responsibility.
[time=3381] It is your responsibility to build yourself up in God's word.
[time=3387] That's yours.
[time=3389] You can't do it no matter how well a pastor preaches.
[time=3393] You've got to be in God's word.
[time=3396] Psalm 119, the longest chapter in the Bible, 176 verses.
[time=3402] Every one of them speaks of the benefit of God's word.
[time=3405] Psalm 119, 162 says, "Finding God's word is pleasure, like finding spoil."
[time=3413] Could you imagine you're just going out for a walk in the park and you're kicking the leaves and all of a sudden you kick something and a wad of something comes flying and you bend down?
[time=3421] There it is.
[time=3422] It's a wad of pictures.
[time=3424] Pictures of Lincoln, Hamilton, Jackson, Grant, Franklin.
[time=3430] All those presidents you love, and it's a wad of money and you look and there's no one around and you investigate.
[time=3436] Nobody claims it's yours.
[time=3438] You found it.
[time=3440] That's what David said.
[time=3441] God's word is like when you study it.
[time=3443] It's like finding treasure and it'll make your way clean.
[time=3449] It'll keep you pure.
[time=3451] It'll be solid.
[time=3453] Remember God's word daily in your lives and secondly pray in the Holy Spirit.
[time=3459] Pray in the Holy Spirit.
[time=3462] We're to remember God's word and as we remember God's word and we study it, we are built up
[time=3468] in Him and as we pray God communicates back to us and there's a completion of a cycle.
[time=3474] But it needs to be the habit and the structure of our life.
[time=3477] Not a crisis intervention, not a dial 911.
[time=3480] God are you there?
[time=3482] It's emergency but a walk of life of character.
[time=3486] Like that soldier faithful to the challenge, daily is obedient to the commander.
[time=3492] We must be daily remembering God's word.
[time=3509] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our sanctuary choir and soloist Susan Toyrach and Keith Brodigam and then the message from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3518] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ just before we close I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3527] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3530] Dear Heavenly Father, we're thankful that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins.
[time=3537] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3544] I know I'm unworthy but I know that you promise to come in if we ask and I ask you to come into my heart today.
[time=3551] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3555] If you prayed this prayer this morning would you write us and tell us the nature of the prayer that you prayed and when you write we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
