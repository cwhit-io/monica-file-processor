[time=107] During the Civil War, their early battles saw the Confederate army inspired and driven.
[time=113] But at the Battle of Bull Run, the Union forces begin to break through their lines.
[time=119] Inspiration came when one of the generals saw one regiment standing solid,
[time=125] and he pointed out with a cry, "Look at Jackson, standing steadfast like a stone wall."
[time=133] Stonewall Jackson comes down as one of the greatest inspirations of military leadership in U.S. history.
[time=141] Stonewall Jackson.
[time=143] In the same spirit, the epistle of Jude says, "Stand fast like a stone wall."
[time=150] (music playing)
[time=160] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=165] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=167] Rick's message today is entitled "Marching Orders" and is taken from the Book of Jude.
[time=173] Stonewall Jackson is not only a model of a military hero, he is also a model of a good soldier for Jesus Christ.
[time=181] As believers, we are to stand fast on the spiritual battlefield.
[time=185] Remaining faithful to Christ is one of our primary marching orders in this eternal conflict.
[time=191] Today's study is the second lesson on marching orders.
[time=194] Instructions from the Book of Jude for each of us who are soldiers of the cross.
[time=200] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study with us.
[time=204] We will be looking at Jude verses 17 to 23.
[time=210] Our special music today includes a song from the sanctuary choir,
[time=216] Ann Bell-Quayer, Kevin Rowe, and Lisa McNamara.
[time=224] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=233] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=238] Now, here's Rick.
[time=240] I want to thank our friends who are joining us by way of television as we invite them to stay with us for the Bible Hours.
[time=246] We take this morning worship service, transfer it by way of television beyond these walls.
[time=252] We've come today to praise God.
[time=254] Some days we praise Him because His goodness is overflowing.
[time=258] Other days we praise Him because He's been faithful through hardships.
[time=263] A family was lost at sea, a wife and four daughters.
[time=268] A husband set sail to go to London there to settle the affairs.
[time=274] When in the night that ship crossed the same point in the ocean where his family was lost, a man by the name of Spafford took out a piece of paper and wrote these words,
[time=285] "Looking into the waters that swallowed up his family," he said, "when peace like a river, a tendeth my way, or when sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot now has taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul."
[time=307] When peace like a river, a tendeth my way,
[time=331] when sorrows like sea billows roll,
[time=340] whatever my lot now has taught me to say,
[time=351] it is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=386] My sin, know the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=398] My sin, not in part, but no hope.
[time=406] My sin is near to the cross, and I bear it no more.
[time=418] Praise the Lord, praise the Lord for my soul.
[time=429] It is well, with my soul.
[time=441] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=453] Praise the Lord, praise the day, when my faith shall be sighed.
[time=464] The clouds be brought back as a scroll.
[time=476] The truth shall be heard, as the Lord shall be sent,
[time=487] even though it is well with my soul.
[time=500] It is well, with my soul.
[time=510] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=538] It is well.
[time=549] [APPLAUSE]
[time=555] Imagine the confidence in the Lord that Horatio Spafford had when he penned those words.
[time=561] May we have that same confidence as we continue to thank the Lord for the goodness, the great things He has done for us.
[time=570] Him number 41, now thank we all our God, him number 41.
[time=580] [MUSIC]
[time=593] Now thank we all our Lord, him number 41.
[time=606] [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=727] I am sure that He is grateful for the fact that we do remember and praise Him and thank Him for His goodness.
[time=735] Listen to the handbells now as they play for us of medley, all glory, Lord, and honor to the Redeemer King.
[time=742] We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing.
[time=747] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=845] We are so thankful you have joined us today by way of television so that we can share our morning worship service with you.
[time=853] And over the past few weeks, we've been studying through the book of Jude and we have this message and one more to go.
[time=859] And as a part of our study of Jude, we've been offering this helpful booklet, Pete entitled The Spirit of Truth and The Spirit of Air.
[time=866] >> You know, Rick, just a few years ago, I was teaching in a public school and there were a number of students whose parents were involved in cults.
[time=874] And they really had a genuine dedication to what they believed.
[time=879] And yet there was so much air, a good amount of truth.
[time=882] But obviously some real error according to the scripture and what they believed.
[time=887] And it's really important for all of us to be aware of those errors so that we can point it out through God's Word and what is truth.
[time=894] >> Well, you know, that is so important because the scripture says that deception is the master lie.
[time=900] And many people have come so close to teaching biblical truth that you really have to look deep before you can see whether it is actually truth or air.
[time=910] And this booklet is entitled The Spirit of Truth and The Spirit of Air.
[time=914] And allow me to illustrate what it has to offer by just sharing some of the excerpts and quotes that are inside it.
[time=922] First of all, it takes several key doctrines such as what does the Bible say about God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, sin, salvation, redemption and retribution.
[time=933] And then it gives us what several different groups teach.
[time=937] Groups like the Christian scientists, the spiritualists, the Jehovah Witness, the Mormons, the Armstrong followers, the Way, and the Unification Church.
[time=947] And by way of example, here is what the Unification Church teaches concerning Jesus Christ.
[time=953] As a man, Jesus was no different from us, except He had no original sin.
[time=960] He was one who lived God's ideal and the fullest realization.
[time=964] He attained the purpose of creation.
[time=968] In light of His attained deity, He may well be called God.
[time=973] Nevertheless, He can by no means be called God Himself.
[time=979] Now what is so significant about that is that the followers of Reverend Moon do not teach that Jesus was eternally God like the Scriptures teach.
[time=989] The Scripture says in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.
[time=996] Way before creation, the Word Jesus Christ was God.
[time=1000] But here the Moonies teach that He was a human being who attained to deity.
[time=1006] And that is certainly not at all true, biblical or orthodox.
[time=1011] Well that's just one of the quotes coming right out of the writings of the original authors of various cults.
[time=1018] We'd like to send you this booklet so that you would be best able to do what 1 John chapter 4 tells us to do.
[time=1025] And that is to discern the spirit of truth from the spirit of air.
[time=1030] And we want you to have a copy and so we're making them available free if you simply write and ask for one.
[time=1037] This booklet can be received if you simply write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1047] We encourage you to write today for this helpful booklet right to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1057] We do hope you'll write today and we would so much appreciate hearing from you as a friend of the ministry.
[time=1064] Coming up in just a few weeks is the biggest event in the life of our church, the annual living Christmas tree pageant.
[time=1072] Is it 14 total concerts? It's an exciting time of the year because so many of our lay people get involved not only in the singing,
[time=1080] but in the preparation of tickets, the distribution, the construction of the living Christmas tree, and it's sat.
[time=1087] We have fire brigade for protection, we have nurses, ushers, just a number of people that work hard to prepare this special Christmas gift to all of our people in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=1099] And we'd certainly invite you to come. There are still tickets available. You can call the church office any weekday and the number is 749-8524.
[time=1110] You need to do that right away, Rick, because there are just a few tickets left and we want to be sure that everybody that wants to come can come.
[time=1118] And I hope that's true for everybody.
[time=1120] And of those concerts, there are 14 total. 13 of those are general public concerts. We give away the tickets free and we hope that you'll call and receive some so that you and your friends can come.
[time=1132] There is a 14th unique concert. It's not the 14th one. It's actually the first one. We call it the living Christmas tree, premiere, dinner, benefit concert.
[time=1143] It's premiere in that it's the first concert. It's a dinner concert in that we have the most elaborate meal that we could possibly host.
[time=1151] And it's a benefit concert in that we ask those who come to pay a generous donation to Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1159] And so it's the premiere dinner benefit concert. And if you, by chance, would like to consider coming to that and supporting Black Hawk Christian School, you could call us at 749-8524.
[time=1172] Monday through Friday and ask for information about the premiere benefit dinner concert and we'll share the information and details with you at that time.
[time=1181] Thank you again for joining us today. Pete, would you share the address one final time?
[time=1186] Yes, we encourage you to write to us either for information concerning the benefit concert or the booklet at the Bible Hour, Box 15000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1198] The zip code is 46815. Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1228] [MUSIC]
[time=1258] In the name of the Lord, we've laid down our lives at the triumph of Christ's bearers down in the earth.
[time=1274] [MUSIC]
[time=1288] We sing the high praises of Heaven and fight with the sword of the Word to bind every stronghold of Satan and prepare the way of the Lord.
[time=1295] We lift up our standard of worship that shatters the darkness with sight, and God will arise on the wings of our praise, and march as a warrior whose mighty and able to save.
[time=1311] We lift up a shout, a victory shout, for we've overcome by the blood of the land and the word of our power.
[time=1325] We've declared war in the name of the Lord, we've laid down our lives at the triumph of Christ's bearers down in the earth.
[time=1339] We lift up a shout, a victory shout, for we've overcome by the blood of the land and the word of our power.
[time=1353] We've declared war in the name of the Lord, we've laid down our lives at the triumph of Christ's bearers down in the earth.
[time=1373] [MUSIC]
[time=1382] Thank you, Kevin. I so appreciate that song. Last Sunday and this very Sunday as we study through Jude, we're receiving from Jude marching orders as soldiers of Christ.
[time=1394] What an appropriate song to challenge us, to stand fast and loyal as soldiers of Christ. Would you bow with me in prayer?
[time=1402] God, as we've heard a song, it's been a song that demands a response. We want to bow before you this morning in pray and declare to you our allegiance to you and our willingness to serve you.
[time=1415] Father, out of this assembly today, may there come a commitment of our hearts that we will serve you, we will engage in the spiritual battle, we will share Christ, we will comfort those who are discouraged,
[time=1428] we will speak a word of encouragement to those who are war torn. God, may we be found faithful as soldiers being obedient to you and to your word.
[time=1439] Father, we would pray today for many in this body who have fought for you and who today need to know of the comfort of your spirit.
[time=1449] Father, we pray for the mercies as they still have the residual pain of the loss of their little girl. We pray for the reasons that their child might grow and be able to come home from the hospital soon.
[time=1463] We pray for those who've lost loved ones in recent days, that your spirit might give to them a peace that does pass human understanding today.
[time=1474] God, we would pray that this morning that those who are unable to be here because their health is impaired, that you would be with them and be a God of all comfort.
[time=1485] We pray for those who came today, but they are war torn, that you would refresh them.
[time=1491] And Father, may each of us today, as we meet here, say in our hearts, great is thy faithfulness, O God our Father, there is no shadow of turning with me. In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1521] May is thy faithfulness, O God my Father, there is no shadow of turning with me.
[time=1545] Though change is not thy compassion's they feel not as though his will, though forever will be.
[time=1567] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1576] Morning by morning, you this is thy seed, all I have needed is thy hand that I have provided, great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[time=1606] Come and winter and springtime and harvest.
[time=1619] Sunday the stars in the courses of all, joy with all each and many for me.
[time=1635] To thy great people, mercy and love.
[time=1648] This part of our sin, and the peace and endurance.
[time=1659] Thy holy presence to cheer and to guide, stay for today, in bright hope for tomorrow.
[time=1675] Blessings of mine with ten thousand, and all ladies of mine.
[time=1688] Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1698] Morning by morning, you this is thy seed, all I have needed.
[time=1714] I have provided, great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1737] Morning by morning, you this is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1767] Thank you, Lisa.
[time=1775] Regardless of our ability to sing with that soprano crescendo, there is an ability of our own hearts to shout forth, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1785] Would you just say those few words with me, great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1791] You know, as a body of people today, we can have that confidence, not that God will always give us life's privileges, but in days of prosperity or in days of adversity, he'll be found faithful, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=1805] What an opportunity is ours to declare this day.
[time=1810] If you have your Bible, I want to invite you to open it with me to the Book of Jude. This Sunday and next we'll conclude our study of this short, powerful epistle of God's Word.
[time=1824] In Jude we have studied what Jude has said by way of instruction and warning about false teachers.
[time=1831] When we come to verses 17 through 23, he now turns to us and he says, "But you, dear children." Word of high contrast in regard to all those others differently but you, dear friends, and he gives three marching orders.
[time=1847] Allow me to read Jude chapter 1 verses 17 through 23 for you. But dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus foretold.
[time=1860] They said to you, "In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.
[time=1871] These are the men who divide you who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the spirit.
[time=1883] But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.
[time=1892] Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
[time=1904] Be merciful to those who doubt, snatch others from the fire and save them.
[time=1911] To others show mercy mixed with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupt flesh."
[time=1920] Well, I believe Jude here is referring to an army of Christians and he gives to them their marching orders.
[time=1927] If you were with us last week, we noted that there are three different verbs here in the imperative that make some commands do it.
[time=1934] The first is found in verse 17, "But dear friends, remember." We are called to remember God's Word.
[time=1943] You know, it's not just important what we have heard, what we have seen, but what we remember.
[time=1949] What we take to heart and by application, we live it out remembering God's Word.
[time=1957] You know, the facility to remember is so important.
[time=1960] An older golfer went to the golf course. He was in his 60s.
[time=1964] He said to the pro as he was paying his green fees, "You know, I'm really a pretty good golfer. I can strike the ball well.
[time=1971] I've got a slight fade and it's usually straight or a little bit to the right, but the eyes aren't so good anymore.
[time=1978] I need a caddy with good eyes." So the pro picked up the phone and he called back to the caddy shop and he said, "We need a caddy for an older gentleman here.
[time=1986] We need one with good eyes who can really follow the ball." The golfer went out and here came the caddy to meet him. That caddy was old enough to be the golfer's dad.
[time=1994] I mean, his hair was gone and his teeth were more absent than present.
[time=2001] And he walked up to this 60 year old golfer and said, "Hi, I'm your caddy." The golfer looked at this guy.
[time=2009] He said, "Sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I'm in my 60s. You've got to be in your 80s.
[time=2014] And my problem is I can't see the ball." Old caddy said, "Don't worry. The hair's gone and the teeth are leaving, but the eyes are still good."
[time=2025] The golfer says, "Okay. Walks up to the tee and he hits a beautiful drive.
[time=2030] He knocks it out there and the caddy's talking the whole way.
[time=2033] Oh, great shot. Straight as no. I see it. Dead said, "Oh, good shot." The golfer's really impressed. This old boy does got the eyes.
[time=2043] And so they start walking down the fairway together.
[time=2046] And the caddy's carrying the bag and talking about what a great shot it is.
[time=2049] They get out through the middle fairway and they can't find the ball.
[time=2053] The golfer says, "The caddy, I thought you had great eyes and I thought you saw it." Caddy said, "I did." He said, "Well, where is it? I forget."
[time=2065] You know, it's not only important that you see what's here.
[time=2068] It's important that you remember an awful lot in God's word.
[time=2072] I have to say, "Yeah, I saw that. Why didn't you do that? I forget." And along with the hair and the teeth, the memory sometimes goes too.
[time=2082] Jude says, "Remember." How are you doing it? Remembering God's word.
[time=2088] The command says to remember it and the instruction is, "Build yourselves up." How do you do that? In the most holy faith, that faith is God's word.
[time=2098] What's the means you can attain that by praying in his most holy spirit?
[time=2102] I hope this past week you've remembered God's word.
[time=2105] Have you been studying it? Have you been memorizing it?
[time=2109] Do you remember? Have you been praying this week?
[time=2113] Not praying God, it's Christmas and here's my list.
[time=2116] But praying God, I want to come to you and I want your spirit to put your list in my heart.
[time=2122] That's command number one. Remember God's word.
[time=2125] Remember we start with a new material today. The second command, remain faithful.
[time=2131] Where do I get that from? Well, look here at verse 21.
[time=2135] Keep yourselves in God's love. Remain faithful. Keep in position.
[time=2142] Of all the construction of human hands, there is only one thing that man has built that is visible from the outer reaches of space.
[time=2152] It is that great wall of China that forms a perimeter barrier on the north to protect China from invasion.
[time=2163] In the history of that wall, which is centuries and centuries old, only three times has an enemy army ever been able to cross the great wall of China.
[time=2175] And each time it's because a guard was bribed. The only time the enemy has ever been able to break through the great wall of China is because somebody deserted their post.
[time=2191] That's what Jude's saying here. Whatever you do, remain faithful. Stand by your post. Be dependable.
[time=2204] We've sang this morning, or we didn't have the privilege of singing. We could only say it. Lisa sang it.
[time=2209] Great is thy faithfulness. Oh, God, our Father, there is no shadow of turning with thee. All I have needed thy hands provided. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.
[time=2222] The question is not is God found faithful to us, but are we found faithful to him?
[time=2230] And he's called us to be good soldiers and to serve him as ambassadors for Christ. To be on the front lines and to be found faithful.
[time=2239] Here, Jude says, remain faithful. Stand up on the front lines. Be counted. Be dependable. Keep yourselves in God's love.
[time=2252] Now, if you look back one verse, it says build yourselves up. This time it says keep yourselves in. An interesting structure, and let me just point it out to you.
[time=2263] You get a verb, build our keep. Then you get a reflexive pronoun yourselves. What is being emphasized here is there's an action to take, and there is one who is to do it. We are to do it for ourselves.
[time=2279] I want to tell you there's a philosophy that's popular. If not popular, at least prevalent. It really irks me. It's this philosophy of the Christian life.
[time=2288] You know, I don't know what to do, so I just let go and let God. That sounds neat. And some people have a way of saying it that it sounds so spiritual.
[time=2298] I'm just going to let go and I'm going to let God. And what it is we're saying, if this book represents responsibility and it's in my hands, what I want to do is I want to transfer the responsibility to somebody else. I'll give it away.
[time=2311] I'm just going to let go and let God. I won't be responsible for myself. You know, there's not anything biblical about that. In fact, the scripture says, even though God saves us and God keeps us, we still have responsibility to keep ourselves.
[time=2327] Now that's not a contradiction. That's a cooperation. Look at Jude chapter 1 verse 1. He introduces himself, Jude, a servant, a brother, and then he describes the recipients to those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father, now this one, and kept by Jesus Christ.
[time=2350] It is Jesus Christ who keeps us. He holds us eternally secure. He will never let go of you if you've given your heart to him.
[time=2358] Yet at the same time that God promises that he'll keep us, he says to us by way of a command, marching orders, keep yourselves.
[time=2368] Is that contradictory? That it's my responsibility? Or is it God's responsibility? It's God's promise and it's our potential.
[time=2375] I like the phrase, it's a divine cooperative. Let me give you some illustrations of a divine cooperative in the Bible.
[time=2382] When you come to Joshua chapter 1, you discover that God says to Joshua, Joshua, I, your God, am going to give you the land.
[time=2396] And you've got to take it. Everywhere that the soul of your foot, you tramp across that. That's what I'm going to give you. I'm going to give it to you, but you have to take it.
[time=2407] And as you study the book of Joshua, it's nothing more than this simple principle. As Joshua obeyed God, God gave him the land.
[time=2416] As the people under Joshua disobeyed God, God withheld from them the land because he said, I'm going to give it to you.
[time=2423] You're going to be victorious in battle, but you've got to fight. God calls us to keep ourselves and not take for granted that he's going to keep us.
[time=2435] It's a teamwork between us and God. He doesn't need our help. He can keep us and he will keep us, but he gives to us the privilege as soldiers to be found faithful.
[time=2445] And to be found steadfast. It says, keep yourselves aware. What's our position?
[time=2452] If that guard was supposed to be on the tower of the Great Wall and he abandoned his position, what's ours?
[time=2458] It says, keep yourself in God's love.
[time=2462] Now, if we take that to mean there is a sphere of people that God loves, then I believe that it's impossible for you to ever be outside of that sphere.
[time=2473] There's not anything that you can do. There's not one thing that I could do. There's not a thousand things that we could do that would somehow separate us from God's love.
[time=2482] Paul said neither height nor depth nor width nor breath nor things present nor things yet to come nor principalities nor powers nor dominions.
[time=2492] Nothing can separate us from God's love.
[time=2495] And why does Jude say keep yourself in it if you can't be separated from it? I believe that he is saying love as a euphemism for obedience.
[time=2505] Now, what am I talking about here? Well, put something here in Jude and turn back to John, would you?
[time=2511] The Gospel according to John, New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and here are the words of Jesus Christ.
[time=2519] John 14 and verse 15, Jesus said, if you love me, you will obey me.
[time=2534] You will keep my commandments. You will do what I say. If you love me, you will obey me.
[time=2542] John, chapter 14, verse 21, whoever has my commandments and obeys them, he is the one who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and I too will love him and show myself to him.
[time=2561] The same thing John picks up in 1 John, chapter 2, and in the 5th verse, he gives the same relationship linking love and obedience.
[time=2571] But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him.
[time=2577] I believe the Scriptures take two things and inseparably link them together.
[time=2583] Love and obedience. You cannot say, God, I really love you and walk in disobedience to him.
[time=2590] He says, if you love me, you will obey me. And if you don't obey me, it's a sign that you really don't love me.
[time=2596] Jude says, keep yourselves in God's love.
[time=2600] You know, in our fluffy sentimentality and our ooey gooey love concepts, we think that somehow there's a distinction between love and obedience.
[time=2610] You know, our kids learn to master that early in life. Your kids are no different in mind.
[time=2616] But my kids have the ability. It's born in them. They inherited it from their mother.
[time=2621] They have this unique ability to sense they're in trouble.
[time=2628] And just about the time they sense they're in trouble, it may be that they've made the family room such a disaster.
[time=2635] The government is considering relief funds.
[time=2638] They've destroyed this section and you walk into the room and you can see panic covering their faces.
[time=2644] You know, the boom's about to be lowered. And they grab this picture. They drew this picture.
[time=2649] They say, Daddy, I made this for you. I love you, Daddy.
[time=2654] I mean, how do you say, great kid, I'm glad you made that paper and you love me and I'll clean up them.
[time=2659] You know, say, oh, honey, that's really a great picture, you know.
[time=2663] We try as children to separate that love from obedience.
[time=2668] We're driving back from Florida. It's been a long hard drive.
[time=2671] Adam has driven Kathy crazy. She has graciously dealt with it.
[time=2676] She has firmly dealt with it. She has now had it.
[time=2679] And she turns around and she points right at him and says, Adam, Richard, hawks.
[time=2684] She didn't get any more out. He saw that long arm and finger.
[time=2688] He had this little car in his hand. He went, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
[time=2693] Drove it right up her arm and Kathy just goes, what do you do?
[time=2700] I mean, how do you threaten that?
[time=2704] Children have that ability, don't they, to say, gotcha.
[time=2710] I'll beat you to the draw. But, you know, God looks at us.
[time=2715] He says, you're not a two-year-old, a little toy in your hand.
[time=2718] If you love me, you'll obey me.
[time=2721] God says, I'm not impressed with the cute little things you say.
[time=2724] I want to know how you walk.
[time=2727] I'm not impressed with how you talk about me.
[time=2730] I want to know how you live.
[time=2733] Jude says, keep yourself in position in God's love.
[time=2738] The Old Testament has the same theme that love and obedience and separably link.
[time=2742] Psalm 9710 that says, let all who love God hate sin.
[time=2749] This says, keep yourself in God's love. It means position yourself in a loving walk with God.
[time=2756] In another word, an obedient love with God.
[time=2760] While you eagerly anticipate is coming.
[time=2764] You know, we're looking unto Jesus, not only as the author and finisher of our faith, but the one who's coming again.
[time=2771] You know, when you're a soldier and you're on the front line, picture the old infantry guys on the front line
[time=2777] and they're fighting and they're battling but they finally hear a trumpet, bugle blowing.
[time=2783] And it sounds the charge and that means there's a whole new line of reinforcements coming to take their place.
[time=2791] You know, there's a day when the Trump of God's going to sound and Jesus will come again.
[time=2796] And he's going to come with his mercy and his love and he's going to take our salvation and he's going to complete it.
[time=2802] And he's going to take us home to heaven. But until then he says, you with eager anticipation of his coming, stand fast.
[time=2811] Stand there like a stone wall unmovable.
[time=2817] In the early encounters of the Civil War, it was the south who was the usual victory.
[time=2825] And as they came to the Battle of Manassas Junction or as others would call it the Battle Bull Run,
[time=2832] it was the first time that the Union Army actually broke through the southern line and started to repel them back towards Richmond.
[time=2840] A southern general saw his men running in fear, refusing to hold their position, but on one flank there was another brigade led by Thomas Jackson.
[time=2852] And they were holding their ground. And this general yelled to his men, look at Jackson, steadfast, standing like a stone wall.
[time=2863] And the rally of those men came forth, stone wall Jackson, and they held their ground and they repelled the Union Army back to Washington, D.C.
[time=2875] And Thomas Jackson became known from that point on as stone wall Jackson as a man who would stand his ground, steadfast.
[time=2886] Jude says, who are the stone walls for Jesus Christ?
[time=2889] Who are the men who will say, I'll be found faithful to Christ.
[time=2893] I'll not be ashamed in the marketplace to say to a businessman, would you come with me to a breakfast?
[time=2899] I'll not be ashamed to go to a neighbor and say, we've got a living Christmas tree, would you come?
[time=2904] I won't be ashamed as a woman to invite other ladies into my home for a Bible study.
[time=2909] I'll not be ashamed of Christ when others talk about their fast lifestyle and the fast lane.
[time=2916] I'll not deny Christ, but I'll be found faithful.
[time=2919] Who are the men who are the women who others can point to and say, see that one?
[time=2927] Standing like a stone wall. You see, Satan would break through the line of the church.
[time=2933] He would destroy believers. He would make havoc of this assembly except for you.
[time=2939] You're a stone wall. That's the second command here. Remain steadfast.
[time=2946] The third command. Rescue the casualties. Look at verse 22.
[time=2954] Be merciful to those who doubt, snatch others from the fire and save them.
[time=2961] To others show mercy mixed with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupt flesh.
[time=2970] Now I'm going to lump all these together as a third imperative. The word that's in the imperative is show mercy.
[time=2977] I'll say rescue. Rescue the casualties.
[time=2982] Now he gives us three different groups and three different responses.
[time=2987] First of all, he says show mercy. You know, God says, you're waiting on the mercy of Christ as you remain steadfast.
[time=2995] You're waiting on the mercy of God. Now that mercy's been given to you, turn around and show mercy.
[time=3002] God's been patient with you. Be patient with others.
[time=3006] Now the first group he identifies, all called doubters. He says show mercy to those who doubt.
[time=3011] As best I can interpret this passage, he's speaking about believers who are confused and who are doubting.
[time=3020] They've heard Jude. Maybe they've even heard Paul. Maybe they've read Peter's epistle.
[time=3026] And they understand what we would call the Orthodox picture.
[time=3030] But they've also over here heard these false teachers who come up with this concept.
[time=3035] Well, Jesus was actually just a man, but he became God at his baptism.
[time=3039] And then when he died, the Spirit left him and then the Spirit, and they're confused.
[time=3044] They say this sounds pretty good, but I'm told that's right. And they're doubting.
[time=3048] They think over here, but maybe this is right.
[time=3051] Or maybe others doubt, and they say I know this is the call of God's word for obedience and purity.
[time=3056] But I've heard the false teachers. I don't know that they're false.
[time=3059] And maybe they're right. Maybe our body is our toy. I'm not going to do whatever we want to do.
[time=3063] They're believers, but they're doubting.
[time=3067] They're going this way, and then they're going that way back and forth.
[time=3072] They're doubters. Now Jude says to them show mercy.
[time=3077] Implied in the word mercy, of course, is patience.
[time=3082] Long suffering. Like the mercy of the Lord, it is patient. It is long suffering.
[time=3088] A famous judge went to church on a Sunday morning. He was not famous for going to church.
[time=3093] And the minister was quite pleased that the judge came, and afterwards he said, "What do you think of the church service and the message?" And the judge said, "Oh, it reminded me of the peace and the mercy of God." Oh, the minister was really flattered. My message was like the peace and the mercy of God.
[time=3109] So he asked the judge, "How is that?" He said, "Well, it's like God's peace and that it surpassed understanding. It's like God's mercy. I didn't think it was ever going to end." No, you think of God's mercy. Remember that little story. It never ends.
[time=3122] And when we deal with believers who are struggling, maybe they are about to be tackled by the enemy.
[time=3128] What a show mercy. We're to patiently encourage and strengthen them.
[time=3133] There's a second group. Just the opposite of the word mercy implying patience is this word.
[time=3139] Snatch. It means to rescue dramatically. It's a physical word.
[time=3144] It is a word that I relate to as a former lifeguard.
[time=3148] It speaks of the lifeguard who's sitting in the chair and they see somebody struggling and they dive in and they snatch them.
[time=3156] A sudden rescue. Why the difference? Why some, this patient and this other, this abruptness?
[time=3163] Well, the first word doubters these, I will call, deceived.
[time=3168] It says, "Snatch others from the fire." I take the word fire to be a euphemism for God's judgment here.
[time=3175] As you read the book of Jude, he refers to the judgment of fire back in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=3180] He refers to the angels that are being held for judgment of eternal fire.
[time=3185] I believe he's saying there are others. They're not believers who are doubting.
[time=3189] These guys have pitched their camp over here. They don't know Christ as Savior.
[time=3193] They haven't received him. They don't identify him as God. They don't walk with him.
[time=3198] They are in present danger of fire and you rescue them.
[time=3203] Dramatic effort to save. It's a call for evangelism.
[time=3209] Rescue the perishing. We are to be committed and active in sharing the gospel.
[time=3217] Then there's a third instruction and a third group.
[time=3220] The first one I called the doubters, the second, the deceived, the third, the dangerous.
[time=3226] Look at verse 23, "Snatch others." That's our second group from the fire.
[time=3230] And save them, third group, and to others, show mercy.
[time=3236] Mixed with fear, hating, even, clothing stained by corrupt flesh.
[time=3243] Now he goes back to that word, mercy, and he says, "Even though this next group are dangerous."
[time=3249] Where did I get that dangerous? Well, it says with fear.
[time=3253] You might translate that fear or you may translate that respect.
[time=3257] But it gives implication that you could be endangered if you're not cautious in dealing with them.
[time=3264] When I took Red Cross life-saving exactly 20 years ago,
[time=3270] I remember the first thing they taught you was when someone is drowning, you ask yourselves two questions. Question number one is this one.
[time=3280] Can I help that person? And question number two is, how can I best help that person?
[time=3288] You see, when someone is drowning, for you to not ask those questions, just instinctively dive in and try to rescue them, there may be the tragedy of a double drowning. They may take you down with them.
[time=3303] And a lifeguard is trained to say, how can I help them?
[time=3309] And what is the best way to do that?
[time=3312] It speaks of the wisdom of a fireman who looks at a house, and he's aware that there's someone that needs help in there, but he must take precautions because it doesn't help if his body is dead next to the victims.
[time=3326] Caution, preparation. Here it says, show mercy to others,
[time=3332] a distinct group with respect, with fear,
[time=3339] because there is a danger that any time we engage in trying to help someone else
[time=3345] that we might become entangled in their messy affairs and become subject with them. Many times the well-intending Christian is trying to help a struggling believer, and the struggling believer influences the stronger Christian.
[time=3362] And now you've got two people entangled in materialism, in sexual indecency,
[time=3369] in philosophy that is ungodly, as one tries to help the other.
[time=3374] If you don't approach it with caution and respect, there's that danger.
[time=3379] And he takes it even a step further, and he says, despising or hating even the clothing stained by the crepe flesh.
[time=3386] What's he mean by that?
[time=3389] Well, Leviticus, they had some very strong segregated rules.
[time=3394] You don't touch dead bodies, you don't touch somebody who's sinned this way until they're clean, and you don't even touch their clothing.
[time=3402] The clothing was a symbolism that their whole life was polluted.
[time=3407] And what are the saying here is you keep distance from people who are dangerous.
[time=3413] You don't associate with them.
[time=3415] The book of Proverbs is full of those type of warnings.
[time=3418] We studied Proverbs recently. Several of these came back to mind.
[time=3421] Listen to Proverbs 4, 14.
[time=3423] Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men.
[time=3429] Avoid it.
[time=3431] Do not travel on it.
[time=3433] Turn away from it and go on your way.
[time=3438] We are to keep a healthy distance dramatically stated by even not even touching the clothing
[time=3446] that's been corrupted.
[time=3449] Three imperatives for the marching orders of the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=3456] Remember God's Word.
[time=3461] Remain steadfast.
[time=3463] Be found faithful in serving Christ.
[time=3467] Rescue others.
[time=3470] By showing mercy to those who are doubting.
[time=3473] By suddenly snatching and rescuing those who are lost and don't know Christ.
[time=3479] And to others who are dangerous because they may entrap you and their sin.
[time=3485] Patiently work with them as well.
[time=3489] Those are the marching orders of the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=3494] Remember, remain, and rescue.
[time=3499] God's instructions to me.
[time=3506] We've been sharing with you today inspirational music from our sanctuary choir.
[time=3518] The handbell choir and our church soloists.
[time=3521] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3524] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal savior.
[time=3529] Just before we close I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3533] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3536] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3543] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3547] I ask you to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me and come in today.
[time=3552] In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=3556] If you prayed that prayer with me today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3560] And then when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
