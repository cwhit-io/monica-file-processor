[time=30] (crickets chirping)
[time=60] - Too often we think of Thanksgiving as one of those occasions where God has poured out great blessings
[time=81] overflowing of abundance, but often Thanksgiving is a spirit of gratitude that comes for the meekest and meagarist of good fortune.
[time=92] During the 30 years' war, one little community had been ravaged by one army after another as they marched through, plundering the land of its crops, burning the city and leaving many homeless and foodless.
[time=105] At one point, the famine had risen so high that a pastor by the name of Martin Rinkard did 50 funerals in one day.
[time=117] When the war was over and food was supplied to that city, here is the hymn that Martin Rinkard wrote.
[time=126] "Now thank we all our God with hard and hands and voices who wondrous things hath done and whom the world rejoices, who from our mother's arms has blessed us on our way with countless gifts of love and still is ours today." (dramatic music)
[time=154] - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=164] Thank you for joining us.
[time=166] Rick's message today is entitled "Praise and Thanksgiving" and it is his final message from the Book of Jude.
[time=172] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study with us.
[time=178] We will be looking at Jude versus 24 and 25.
[time=181] Our special music includes a song from the sanctuary choir as well as Keith and Starr Bratagum.
[time=190] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=201] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=205] Now, here's Rick.
[time=208] - Join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=215] On this Thanksgiving weekend, our choir has prepared a song that is entitled "A Song of Thanksgiving" and we hope it sets the pace in your heart today to express your gratitude to God for the spiritual blessings he'd given to us as we celebrate with Thanksgiving.
[time=233] (gentle music)
[time=240] - Oh Lord, how great thou art
[time=247] and how marvelous are thy works.
[time=250] We praise your name because of thy loving kindness toward us.
[time=255] You are good to all and have compassion on everything you have created.
[time=260] It is because of you that we live.
[time=263] You are the one who covers the sky with clouds and supplies the earth with rain.
[time=269] Lord, your loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting.
[time=274] You have hardened our iniquities, healed our diseases and made us your children forever.
[time=280] You have loved us with an everlasting love.
[time=285] Oh Lord, we will forever praise you with our whole heart.
[time=289] [MUSIC - 304 seconds]
[time=598] - Thanksgiving's been a wonderful time
[time=618] in the entire month of November and praising the Lord together here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=626] We do have a wonderful Lord and Savior.
[time=628] We're going to sing now.
[time=629] His name is wonderful.
[time=631] Number 43, please.
[time=633] Number 43.
[time=634] (gentle music)
[time=651] [MUSIC - 165 seconds]
[time=822] - What a privilege it is to represent a perfect savior, Redeemer, and King.
[time=830] We've had the privilege this year of having Keith and Star-Brodigan home in Fort Wayne with us.
[time=836] They've been singing faithfully in our choir and we appreciate their ministry.
[time=840] We remember many years ago when we met each one of them, two different occasions, one in Grand Rapids and one in Fort Wayne.
[time=847] Finally, that space between Grand Rapids and Fort Wayne got a little smaller and a little smaller and Keith has been studying in school and is here for the year.
[time=857] And as I said, has been faithfully working with the church and we appreciate their ministry.
[time=861] We love them both.
[time=862] I understand this happens to be their sixth anniversary of marriage and we're glad for their lives, their ministry, and they're gonna minister to us today.
[time=872] Let's listen to them as they do that right now.
[time=874] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=982] - Well, we hope you have had a delightful holiday season.
[time=994] For us here, this has been Thanksgiving Weekend.
[time=997] I know you're watching it a week later, but please allow this belated Thanksgiving greeting from all of us.
[time=1003] Pete, did you and your family have a good weekend?
[time=1006] - We had a wonderful time, Rick.
[time=1007] Our son was home from college, and we had some folks that are from the church here that don't have family in the area join us, because of course, our family is all on the West Coast.
[time=1016] So we had a great time of fellowship around the table and talking about spiritual things during the day.
[time=1021] - Well, that's great.
[time=1023] Our family also had a delightful time, and we hope you did as well.
[time=1027] Today is our last study in the book of Jude, and it is a study that brings us to what we would call a doxology, and that is a word that simply means praise and thanksgiving.
[time=1037] And so it's a very appropriate study for this Thanksgiving weekend.
[time=1041] And this being the final study in the book of Jude, this is the last Sunday.
[time=1045] We will be able to offer you a booklet entitled "The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Air." This is a publication from Moody Press that helps you, and it helps me understand what the scriptures teach on several key doctrinal issues, what the Bible teaches about God, about Jesus Christ, about the Holy Spirit, about the word of God, about sin, salvation, and God's plan for redemption.
[time=1071] But not only does it tell us what the Bible says, but it tells us where various groups, false teachers depart from the scripture, and many cults have the ability of sounding very biblical, yet in reality, they are a departure from the scriptures.
[time=1087] This pamphlet helps us know where the word of God stands and where others deviate.
[time=1093] Again, this is the last Sunday that we'll be able to offer it to you.
[time=1097] And so we'd like to ask you to write today, and we'll send you a copy.
[time=1101] This is an extremely helpful booklet for those of you that really want to know the truth of what God's word has to say.
[time=1107] And you can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1114] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1117] Once again, it's the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1126] Well, with the coming and passing of Thanksgiving, that means the living Christmas tree is literally right around the corner.
[time=1132] I believe we're only about 11 days from the first concert.
[time=1136] Does that make you nervous?
[time=1137] - Yes, there's a lot to do yet.
[time=1139] We have a lot of volunteers coming in tomorrow morning, and we'll be working throughout this week, and then Sunday, December 6th, the steal in the afternoon, as soon as church as over goes up, and we just proceed until that first concert on Thursday evening.
[time=1153] - Well, we're looking forward to that.
[time=1155] There are 13 public concerts.
[time=1157] How are the tickets going for those?
[time=1159] - I would encourage anyone that is just interested in coming to the tree that they should call immediately and reserve some tickets.
[time=1166] There are a few left, but I'm sure by the end of the day, or even tomorrow, through the first couple days of this week, there'll be some available.
[time=1174] After that, they could be tight.
[time=1175] There is a waiting list, however, Rick, and often people do are faithful in turning back extra tickets, and we can call those people who are on the waiting list and see to it as best we can that they get tickets.
[time=1187] - When Pete says, "Call immediately," we do need to ask you to wait until tomorrow because we're only open at the business office from eight until five Monday through Fridays, and so if you call the day, the people who will answer the phone are simply there to help with today's services and won't know anything about tree ticket distribution.
[time=1207] - There's one other concert I would like to mention to you.
[time=1210] It's called a benefit concert, and the benefit is for our school Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1215] It's a premier dinner benefit concert.
[time=1217] It's premier, and it's the first one.
[time=1219] It's on December the 10th.
[time=1221] It's a dinner concert.
[time=1222] We have an elegant meal, and it's a benefit concert because for an offering, our commitment to purchase the ticket, you can come and it benefits Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1232] If you would like information on the premier benefit dinner concert, you may call the church office Monday through Friday at 749-8524.
[time=1243] At 749-8524.
[time=1247] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, I would simply like to ask you to be praying with us for our need for some new television equipment.
[time=1256] No longer being a live broadcast, that means that we need additional and more of a higher quality tape recording system and a number of other important pieces of equipment.
[time=1267] So, we'd simply like you to be partners with us in praying that God meets that need.
[time=1272] Thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1275] We trust God will use this hour to strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ, or perhaps in some case, to bring you to the awareness that He loves you personally and that He has a plan for you.
[time=1286] (upbeat music)
[time=1294] [MUSIC - 135 seconds]
[time=1440] - Jesus said in John 10, 11,
[time=1454] "I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd" lays down his life for his sheep.
[time=1459] [MUSIC - 227 seconds]
[time=1689] - Thank you, Keith and Starr.
[time=1702] Psalm 116 is a psalm of praise and thanksgiving.
[time=1707] And it is laid out as a responsive reading in the back of our hymn book.
[time=1712] If you'll turn to the back of your hymn book, there are a number of responsive readings and this is responsive reading, 16.
[time=1720] The design is that there is a light type and I will read those paragraphs after which we'll ask you as a congregation to read together what is in the bold type.
[time=1732] Could I ask you to stand at this time that we could read responsibly?
[time=1736] God's word, selections from Psalm 116.
[time=1739] I love the Lord because he hath heard my voice
[time=1746] and my supplications.
[time=1748] - Amen.
[time=1756] - The sorrows of death compassed me and the pains of hell gat hold upon me.
[time=1763] I found trouble and sorrow.
[time=1767] - Amen.
[time=1776] Gracious is the Lord and righteous.
[time=1779] Yay, our God is merciful.
[time=1782] - Amen.
[time=1789] Return unto thy rest.
[time=1790] O my soul.
[time=1792] For the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
[time=1796] - For the last of the earth, my soul, for the earth, my last of the years, and my feet, for the Lord.
[time=1805] - I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
[time=1810] - For the last of the earth is the Lord.
[time=1812] For all the tenderness for thee.
[time=1815] - I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=1821] - I will take my house to the Lord and count the presence of all the people.
[time=1828] - Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
[time=1834] - For the glory to thee are in the servant and my servant in the servant and me.
[time=1842] For the rest is my house.
[time=1845] - I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=1853] - I will take my house to the Lord and count the presence of all the people.
[time=1860] - Father, we come today and we have brought with us no lamb to be sacrificed, no pair of turtle doves to be placed upon an altar.
[time=1869] Father, we have brought the sacrifice of the thanksgiving and the praise of our lips and may the meditation of our hearts and the words of our lips be acceptable in thy sight.
[time=1885] O God, our creator and maker, in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1890] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1894] Well, on this thanksgiving weekend, many of us have already celebrated with families.
[time=1903] We've gone through those traditions of slicing the turkey, of over-eating, and then coming back later in the day to do the same again.
[time=1911] As a part of that, many of us express our gratitude.
[time=1915] But I have discovered in my life that I'm very much like my children, and that is my children often have wrote little sayings that they had dropped at just the right time.
[time=1926] If we ask any of our children to pray, regardless of the day, the hour or the occasion, the prayer is always the same.
[time=1932] Thank you, God, for this day and.
[time=1934] Somewhere along the way, they heard a teacher or a Sunday school teacher pray that prayer and it became etched in one of their minds and the children have taught it, and it's just wrote prayer.
[time=1945] Not that there's something wrong with repetition, but there is often the habit of repetition that's void of any meaning and purpose.
[time=1955] When we come to thanksgiving, what are the things that we're thankful for?
[time=1958] Most of us, if we were to ask, "What are we thankful for?" We'd say, "I'm thankful for America, "and I'm thankful for the pilgrims they landed on that rock." What was it?
[time=1966] Oh, yes, the rock of Gibraltar and from the rock of Gibraltar, it's Plymouth Rock.
[time=1970] Some of you are wondering about my history teachers.
[time=1973] But we say those things out of wrote memory.
[time=1975] Can I ask you to do a little exercise today?
[time=1978] Totally secret, totally confidential.
[time=1980] If you have a pen or a pencil, take that out and take the corner of your bulletin and write out one little thing you're thankful for.
[time=1987] Now, you can cup your hand over that, so no one else will see it.
[time=1990] This is totally confidential.
[time=1993] You write out one thing you're thankful for.
[time=1995] Now, if you're not here today, you're watching by way of television, you can do this at home.
[time=1999] What is it that you're thankful for?
[time=2001] Now, this is completely yours.
[time=2003] It's confidential, it's secret.
[time=2004] No one else is going to be looking over your shoulder at it.
[time=2007] They're busy writing their own.
[time=2009] It's a good exercise to list at least one thing we're thankful for.
[time=2014] Have you done that?
[time=2015] Okay, now while you're looking at me, reach over and steal the bulletin of the other guy and we'll see what they said.
[time=2022] Let me ask you to go a step further.
[time=2024] Would two or three or maybe even 10 people just say a short phrase of something they're thankful today.
[time=2030] Would you just say that out loud?
[time=2032] - My wife.
[time=2035] Were you in troubled home this week?
[time=2037] (audience laughs) Good.
[time=2040] One said they're help made in life, they're wife.
[time=2043] Somebody said something over here.
[time=2045] God himself, Bob, what else would you be thankful for?
[time=2048] - I'd love for God's love and for health.
[time=2050] - God's love and for health.
[time=2052] Good.
[time=2053] This great salvation, thank you, Harold.
[time=2057] What else would you be thankful for on this day?
[time=2060] Family.
[time=2062] Roxanne Cecil.
[time=2064] Cecil Lawson says is grace is sufficient
[time=2070] through all troubles.
[time=2071] Cecil and Jenny Lawson have buried four parents this year.
[time=2076] The last on Wednesday, the eve of Thanksgiving, yet today a heart can say I'm thankful that God's gracious.
[time=2083] Praise God for that testimony today, Cecil.
[time=2086] Well, each of us have those occasions for Thanksgiving.
[time=2089] Many times our Thanksgiving comes because we live in the land of abundance and prosperity and we thank God for all that He's given us and there's certainly not anything wrong with that.
[time=2101] But you know our Thanksgiving tradition was not born out of a spirit.
[time=2105] I said, God you've showered us with every blessing.
[time=2108] We have so much we wanna stop and say thanks.
[time=2112] That wasn't the spirit at all.
[time=2113] It was a thankfulness that came out of saying, God we survived.
[time=2117] You know Thanksgiving was not originally in November.
[time=2121] It was in May and those pilgrim fathers survived a winner and barely survived.
[time=2127] Many of them died, many of them buried their children.
[time=2131] Many of them lived on such a meager substance that they were barely alive.
[time=2136] But when they emerged through that first harsh New England winner, they were alive and they said, let us declare this day a Thanksgiving and gratitude to God because they had survived it.
[time=2149] There was a small town in Northern Germany.
[time=2155] During the 30 years war, so named because of its length.
[time=2160] This little town had been invaded and ransacked repeatedly.
[time=2165] The German army, the Danish army, the Swiss army all seemed to march through this one little town.
[time=2172] Their crops had been plundered and destroyed by army year after year.
[time=2177] The farmers were driven into the city out of poverty.
[time=2180] The city was overcrowded and void of food itself.
[time=2184] Death and plague were everywhere.
[time=2187] So many were dying that in one day a pastor by the name of Martin Rinkard buried 50 people.
[time=2195] He gave a funeral for 50 different people in a single day.
[time=2201] But the 30 years war ended with the peace of Westphalia and on that occasion, after 30 years of ravaged travesty of war, Martin Rinkard penned these words in a hymn.
[time=2216] Now thank we all our God.
[time=2218] With hard and hands and voices whom wondrous things hath done.
[time=2224] In whom the world rejoices, who from our mother's arms hath blessed us on our way.
[time=2231] With countless gifts of love and still is ours today.
[time=2236] Gratitude in the face of adversity.
[time=2242] Some of you this past week or this year has been a week of adversity.
[time=2248] By God's grace this Sunday morning, we've come to praise Him and to thank Him.
[time=2253] What is there to thank God for?
[time=2255] What if you're one of the Lawson's and you've buried four loved ones since last Thanksgiving?
[time=2260] What is there to thank God for?
[time=2261] What if you've lost your job this past year?
[time=2264] What if your wife has been unfaithful to you?
[time=2268] What if your husband has divorced you?
[time=2270] What if your children have broken your heart?
[time=2273] Could you give thanksgiving to God today?
[time=2276] What would there be that would be worth giving Him thanks for?
[time=2280] Jude verses 24 and 25.
[time=2284] We've been studying for several weeks now through this epistle of Jude.
[time=2289] We concluded today with the last two verses.
[time=2292] Jude 24 and 25.
[time=2296] It reads like this, "To Him who is able to keep you from falling
[time=2303] and present you before His glorious presence without fault and with great joy.
[time=2310] To the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power, authority through Jesus Christ, our Lord, before all ages, now and forever, more, amen."
[time=2328] Some of your Bibles have a little note that introduces these last two verses.
[time=2332] It's just a little paragraph heading that says, "Doxology." You know, we often sing a song that is called the "Doxology." Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[time=2342] Praise Him all creatures here below.
[time=2345] That's a word, "Doxology." It is a word that comes from the Greek "doxa," which means glory, and to ascribe glory to God.
[time=2354] Jude here is ascribing glory to God.
[time=2358] He ends it by saying, "To God be glory, majesty, power, and authority." It's a "Doxology." But in this "Doxology," He gives us three reasons why we ought to come to God with praise, why we ought to bring to Him as Psalms put it, "The sacrifice of our lips of thanksgiving." Why should we do that?
[time=2380] First of all, He says, "This praise be to the one who is able."
[time=2387] If you were saying that song, "He is able, He is able." I know He's able, I know my Lord is able to carry me through.
[time=2395] Perhaps the hymn writer had this phrase in mind, it says we should praise God because He is able to keep us from falling.
[time=2405] It is God's omnipotent eternal hand that graspable believer and holds us secure and keeps us from ever being lost from His kingdom and His plan.
[time=2420] Jude begins and ends his epistle in the same way.
[time=2426] In the first verse, He says, "We are Christians who are kept by Jesus Christ." And then He ends it by saying, "God keeps us." But in the middle of that passage, He teaches some alarming truths.
[time=2441] He teaches that there are false professors of Christ.
[time=2445] Now, when I say professors, I don't mean those who have a PhD and they're teaching at the local university.
[time=2451] Someone who professes with their mouth to know Christ, but in reality, they've never given their heart to Him.
[time=2459] And He says, "There are false professors who walk among you, but there are apostates, that means they fall away." And with these intermittent verses and warning about apostates falling away, these believers might have fear, "Am I going to fall away?" Jude begins by saying, "Jesus Christ keeps you." And now, under Him who is able to keep you, He wants you to know that as a true believer in Christ, there is not a possibility that you will fall away.
[time=2489] One of the things we love to do, and we do it almost every Thanksgiving now, is to go to a park back home in Kogafal, Ohio, called the Gorge.
[time=2499] Now, you may not realize this, but that area of Ohio is fairly hilly, and you're starting to build the step hills to the Appalachians.
[time=2506] And there's a powerful river called Kajoga River that thunders its way through the hard rock of that area, and it has carved out a deep gorge over the years that has pounded its way through there.
[time=2520] And we love to go to the Gorge Park, and we crawl on the ledges and the high ledges, and we take the high trail out, and then when we come down to the low trail, it's not all that low.
[time=2531] It is a straight drop-off through some trees down to the river, maybe 50, even 100 feet below.
[time=2539] As we walk across that path and we get near the edge of it, my children love to look over the edge, and they get close to the edge, and about the time they get near the edge, they say, "Dad, hold me, and I get two hands in this one, and the third one is in them, and I hold them, and they lean over the edge." Now, don't let go.
[time=2560] I got you, okay, but hold tight now, and they look over that edge.
[time=2565] Do you ever feel like you're looking over the edge of life?
[time=2568] Or is the Heavenly Father who said, "I'll grab ahold of you at that edge, and I'll hold you, and I won't let you go." I've got you, and Jude says, praise God.
[time=2580] He is the one who is able to keep us from falling.
[time=2585] But you know, the word falling there could perhaps even be more accurately translated, the one who is able to keep you from stumbling.
[time=2595] You know, it's possible to stumble and then to catch yourself.
[time=2599] But this passage says, "God will hold you so secure that He'll keep you not only from falling down, but He'll keep you from even stumbling." He'll hold you that secure.
[time=2612] But there's a balance here because even though verse one and verse 24 says, "God keeps us." Don't forget verse 21 that says, "As believers, we have responsibility to keep ourselves." You see, many people will take liberty since God's gonna hold me eternally secure, I can place all the responsibility on God.
[time=2632] Oh no, you can't do that.
[time=2633] God says, "You must keep yourself in the most holy thing."
[time=2639] You must keep yourselves waiting for God's love.
[time=2642] Romans 13, Paul put it this way.
[time=2647] Give no occasion to our flesh, our physical bodies to fulfill its desires that are out of control, lust in a word.
[time=2657] You see, most of the time, no, all of the time when we're tempted and we sin, it's because we have positioned ourselves right in the pathway of potentiality.
[time=2669] Yesterday, we're driving home four hours from Akron, Ohio, and one of the children's dear aunts gave them a little goody bag, little clickers, and a harmonica.
[time=2683] Now, Scott played the synthesizer beautifully like a harmonica as the service began today, but Adam and Scott aren't quite at the same level.
[time=2691] Scott's a little bit ahead of that.
[time=2693] And they had the clickers out and the harmonica going, and finally, I reached a point where I said, "Time out, clickers, and harmonica back in the bag." Five minutes later, I heard this whoop, cross the harmonica.
[time=2708] I turned around and there's Adam.
[time=2710] It was an accident, Dad, it was an accident.
[time=2712] Let me make sure I understood what he was saying to me yesterday.
[time=2717] He put the harmonica back in the bag.
[time=2719] Apparently, we had a bump at some point at which the harmonica bounced out of the bag, got caught in his mouth, and he just had to breathe, and it was an accident.
[time=2729] Now, a little guy took that harmonica out of the bag, didn't he?
[time=2735] And he put it up to his mouth, and then the temptation got him.
[time=2740] You know, that's how it is as an adult.
[time=2744] We don't suddenly fall into temptation.
[time=2746] We choose to walk over in its neighborhood.
[time=2749] We choose to go down its main street, and then when we're in the midst of all of it, and we sin, we say, it was an accident.
[time=2757] I really didn't mean to do this.
[time=2760] I don't know.
[time=2763] We have given ourselves opportunity to fulfill the lust.
[time=2767] We have failed to keep ourself, and we have sorely disappointed and tested God because he is so merciful to say, I'll keep you, but he is able, are we willing?
[time=2783] We need to be as good soldiers of Jesus Christ standing on the front line, unswavering, undaunted, unmoving, keeping ourselves.
[time=2795] With World War II eminent, Churchill stood before the House of Commons and said, we must brace ourselves to our duties.
[time=2806] For if England in this commonwealth shall last, another thousand years, may those men say, this was her finest hour.
[time=2815] Beloved, if Jesus Christ carries another thousand years
[time=2821] before he comes again, may the students of the history of the church of Jesus Christ look back at this church and say, this was its finest hour because we have not presumed upon God's grace when he said he'll keep us, and we will strive to keep ourselves.
[time=2841] But on this Thanksgiving day, I know my limitations.
[time=2845] I know my own heart, and though I may have walked with Christ yesterday and today, I know that there'll be sin in my life.
[time=2852] I'm so thankful today that there's a God who said, Hawks, I'll keep you.
[time=2856] You can keep yourself, but you'll fail.
[time=2859] And in those moments of shortcoming, I'll pick you up in my right hand and I will keep you.
[time=2866] Why would we be thankful today?
[time=2868] Now on to him who is able to keep you from falling.
[time=2872] Second reason to thank him is not only does he keep us from falling, but he presents us faultless.
[time=2879] It just happens to work out in English.
[time=2881] Keeps us from falling, presents us faultless.
[time=2885] You know, it's a great joy to be kept, secure, and protected.
[time=2891] But God's plan goes beyond keeping us secure and protected, he actually has a plan for the use of our lives.
[time=2899] And God's plan for our lives is to present us faultless before his throne with exceeding great joy.
[time=2910] The Bible says that it's joy for Jesus
[time=2916] to present us before his throne.
[time=2919] Many of us have studied intently Hebrews 12, one and two, we've studied that often here.
[time=2925] You remember Hebrews 12, two says, looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, set in advance, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of God.
[time=2945] The Bible teaches us that Jesus Christ came to the cross and he saw it as pain, he saw it as death, he saw it as something to be despised and to be avoided.
[time=2955] But instead he embraced it because in front of him was the cross and in advance or before that was a joy.
[time=2965] And what that joy was, Jude tells us, Jesus' joy is to present you and to present me spotless and faultless before the glory of his presence.
[time=2980] You see, before the cross, Jesus said, that's my joy, to present my bride spotless.
[time=2988] And before the incarnation at Bethlehem, he said, that's my joy, to present them spotless.
[time=2994] And before the Old Testament was revealed, that's my joy, to present them spotless.
[time=3000] And before the creation of the world, Jesus said, my joy is to present them spotless.
[time=3006] Without becoming overly romantic or sentimental.
[time=3010] Let me tell you about the best April Fools Day in my life.
[time=3015] You're not gonna believe this, but Kathy and I were married on April Fools Day.
[time=3024] Now there was a reason for that.
[time=3025] More than we were April Fools, that was spring break in seminary.
[time=3030] And I remember, April the 1st, 1977, Chapel and University Park in a small chapel standing there nervous.
[time=3040] And Kathy walked in.
[time=3042] I remember that dress.
[time=3043] We just looked at some pictures the other day.
[time=3045] If that dress was white, it was spotless.
[time=3049] It'd never been worn before.
[time=3053] It had been saved for that moment.
[time=3055] And as she came down, that short aisle, not only was that dress spotless, but her face, her countenance, it was spotless.
[time=3069] What a joy as young man.
[time=3072] To behold one who would come and say, I'll be your life's partner.
[time=3076] Pure, spotless and beautiful.
[time=3079] Why do I tell you that story today?
[time=3083] Because you see, that is the exact relationship Jesus Christ has with us.
[time=3089] Ephesians chapter five and Revelation chapter 19 says, we, the church, are as bride.
[time=3098] There's gonna come a day.
[time=3100] Jude's speaking over here, we're presented before him.
[time=3103] And he's gonna keep us.
[time=3108] And he's gonna clean us so well, that we're gonna be spotless.
[time=3113] He's gonna take this old life of mine with its sins and its shortcomings and its things.
[time=3118] And he's gonna clean it.
[time=3120] And he's gonna bring it to himself, spotless.
[time=3126] I'm so thankful today that God would take my life.
[time=3130] Dirty, sinful and make it clean and present it to himself in eternity, spotless.
[time=3141] Aren't you thankful today?
[time=3143] There's a third occasion here for Thanksgiving.
[time=3149] To him who was able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault with exceeding joy.
[time=3161] Third one to the only God and our Savior.
[time=3166] Finally, we not only present thanksgiving to God
[time=3173] because of what he's done and what he is doing, but we simply praise him for who he is.
[time=3178] He is God and the emphasis here is he is the only God.
[time=3183] Now that makes such simplistic sense to you in my course, he's the only God.
[time=3187] But many of these people would be what we would call polytheistic, polymanytheistic gods.
[time=3195] As a matter of fact, the pagans had many gods, but so did the intelligentsia of the Greeks.
[time=3201] With all of their learning and with all of their knowledge, they were polytheistic.
[time=3205] And in their pantheon, there would be a God of war, Mars.
[time=3208] There would be a God of the sea, Neptune.
[time=3211] There would be a God of anger, the furies.
[time=3214] There would be a God of love, Aphrodite.
[time=3217] There would be a God of grain series.
[time=3219] There would be a God of the underworld, Pluto.
[time=3223] And as you would go up this hill, a very opagus of Mars Hill, there would be statues and shrines and temples built to every God they had a name for.
[time=3232] And then in almost a move of desperation, they said, what if, what if we missed a God so they built a God, a tomb, a monument to the unknown God, just in case they missed one.
[time=3245] And here Jude would stand above all the voices of the Greeks and the pagans and say, he is the only God.
[time=3252] And he's not only the only God.
[time=3256] He is our savior.
[time=3259] The first phrase is very declarative.
[time=3261] The second phrase is very personal.
[time=3263] The only God our savior.
[time=3266] And he takes that transcendency of a God in heaven who rules over all.
[time=3272] And he said, he's our savior.
[time=3274] Oh, today we meet because he saves us and keeps us and he presents us.
[time=3280] And Jude says, that's why there should be to him the shout of praise.
[time=3285] And he gives four words of praise very quickly.
[time=3288] First one, glory.
[time=3290] Glory speaks of the unchanging in comparable glory of God.
[time=3295] Who is like the Lord?
[time=3298] There is none like the Lord.
[time=3300] His glory is so radiant, his countenance so bright that mankind could not look upon him without being consumed.
[time=3309] But they'll come a day when God translates these new, our old bodies into new ones so that we can stand before his presence.
[time=3318] And today our very purpose in life is to give God glory.
[time=3323] Do you know when you look at life, what is the purpose of life?
[time=3326] Is the purpose of life only to make enough money that the money lasts longer than the month?
[time=3331] Is the purpose in life only to get the kids through the third grade this year?
[time=3336] What was the purpose in life only to accumulate a few more things?
[time=3339] Oh, no.
[time=3340] Revelation tells us God has created us for his pleasure and for his glory.
[time=3347] That's why we live to glorify him.
[time=3350] Can I confess to you as a high school student I lived for my own glory?
[time=3354] Can I struggle and tell you today that that's still a battle that each of us will face to seek glory for ourselves?
[time=3363] I swim on a swim team in every Friday and Saturday.
[time=3366] I hope to win so that as I'd go to school on Monday maybe someone would say, "How did you do?" And I'd say, "I won." And glory would come to my name.
[time=3376] You see, God says the glory belongs to Christ.
[time=3381] That's the purpose of our life.
[time=3384] Not to make our name great, but to make his name great, to glorify him.
[time=3390] Jude says, "Because of who he is and what he's done." Glory to God, not to anyone else.
[time=3396] Secondly, he says, "Majesty." That word I think means recognition of his rule.
[time=3403] It speaks of a throne and of a great one sitting on the throne.
[time=3407] The phrase out of Revelation is king of kings and Lord of lords.
[time=3411] Glory, recognizing his majesty.
[time=3415] The third word is power.
[time=3417] Power speaks of raw brute strength.
[time=3422] That God has the power.
[time=3424] He's like the strong man in the army or the weight lifter.
[time=3427] Are that dominant player on the basketball court who has the power?
[time=3432] But fourthly, he has the authority.
[time=3434] He has the righteous use of his power.
[time=3436] He's not a mad man unleashed.
[time=3438] He is a God with power under control.
[time=3441] Authority.
[time=3445] What is it that we are about today?
[time=3446] On this day, we've come to recognize God.
[time=3449] Who he is and what he's done.
[time=3451] Say, "God, to you belongs all the glory." God, to you belongs the majesty and the recognition of greatness.
[time=3458] God, to you, is ascribed all the power.
[time=3461] Whatever strength I have, God, I know it's infinitely small.
[time=3464] You have the power, and God, you have the authority.
[time=3468] And I submit to him.
[time=3469] You see, in the light of the glory.
[time=3476] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and our special friends, Keith and Starr Brodygum.
[time=3482] The message from God's word was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3486] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3491] As Pastor Rick mentioned earlier, Jesus does love you and has a plan for your life.
[time=3496] If you'd like to begin that journey with him, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3501] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3503] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3510] And I know that the wages of sin is death.
[time=3513] I want you to come into my heart and to cleanse me of my sins and to forgive me so that I can receive eternal life.
[time=3520] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3524] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of the prayer that you prayed?
[time=3529] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Your Decision to Help You Get Started in Your Spiritual Walk with God."
