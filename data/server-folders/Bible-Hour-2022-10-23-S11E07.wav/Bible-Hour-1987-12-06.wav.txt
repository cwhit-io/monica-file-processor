[time=113] Throughout the ages, man has struggled with the question, what is it that gives life, its purpose, in its direction, Shakespeare penned these words and put them in the mouth of his Macbeth.
[time=127] Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets its hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more.
[time=140] It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
[time=146] a signifying nothing.
[time=151] What is it that gives life, its purpose, and its meaning?
[time=155] John said in him was life and the life was the light of men.
[time=160] Welcome to an hour of Bible-studied music and fellowship
[time=174] on the Bible Hour.
[time=175] Thank you for joining us.
[time=177] Rick's message today is entitled, "A Son, A Savior, His Preexistence." During this Christmas season, we will be studying the life of Christ.
[time=187] Surprising as it may seem to some, Christ did not begin His life at Bethlehem.
[time=192] In reality, Christ has always existed.
[time=196] He is the eternal God who created the world.
[time=199] Christmas marks not His beginning, but His entrance into the world.
[time=204] It is in the pre-existent eternal Christ that life finds its meaning and direction.
[time=208] For in Him was life and the life was the light of man.
[time=212] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=216] We will be looking at John chapter 1, verses 1 through 4, and verse 14.
[time=222] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=227] Other special music includes a song from error and a solo from Lisa McIntosh.
[time=235] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort White, Indiana, and can be seated on this station each week at this time.
[time=242] We pray that the Lord will use this telecaste to minister to you.
[time=247] Now here's Rick.
[time=248] - The Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=250] Welcome this morning.
[time=252] We trust that in this hour that Jesus Christ would have the supremacy in everything.
[time=257] We're delighted that you're here, and we welcome our friends who join us by way of television this morning that we might worship Jesus Christ, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=271] The choir is singing in medley of carols of the Advent season.
[time=275] The final carol is joy to the world.
[time=277] The Lord is come.
[time=279] It's found on hymn number 104 in your hymnals.
[time=282] When we get to that carol, will you join with us singing the first and fourth stanza together?
[time=287] (gentle music)
[time=299] (singing in foreign language)
[time=329] [MUSIC - 64 seconds]
[time=399] (gentle music)
[time=418] [MUSIC - 197 seconds]
[time=639] - What a joy to worship the king, all glorious above.
[time=642] Him number 11, continue worshiping in song 111.
[time=647] I'm sorry, number 11.
[time=649] Sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas of number 11.
[time=654] (orchestral music)
[time=669] [MUSIC - 91 seconds]
[time=763] - Thank you again for participating,
[time=771] singing the joys of our Lord.
[time=773] Together with the choir and orchestra, congregation, what a marvelous praise it is to our Heavenly Father as we sing like that.
[time=783] Just a very brief note.
[time=784] This is a time when we are very busy with the living Christmas tree.
[time=788] Working hard and the finishing touches of the music and this afternoon we will begin construction of the tree.
[time=794] If you signed up to help build the tree or help work on the tree in any way and you weren't called, please feel free to come to the church at any time beginning 12.30 today through next Thursday about 6.30 p.m. we should be done
[time=811] because that's the beginning of our first concert.
[time=814] Now we need you.
[time=815] So if you weren't called, it was an oversight.
[time=817] We have many, many jobs that you can work at and we need your help.
[time=823] So feel free to come.
[time=824] If you've got an hour to give, come.
[time=826] We'll take that hour.
[time=827] If you have eight hours to give, that's better yet.
[time=829] We'd love to have you participate in this way and it makes our job a little bit easier.
[time=834] We enjoy the music of the Black Hawk Christian School and today we have with us in our worship service mirror.
[time=841] The ensemble from the school, they're directed by Emily Pippen.
[time=845] Let's listen to them as they minister to us through the medium of music.
[time=848] (guitar music)
[time=854] [MUSIC - 105 seconds]
[time=964] (audience applauding)
[time=979] (guitar music) [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=1107] (audience applauding)
[time=1116] - Again, we want to thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1120] We hope that God's using this time to strengthen you and encourage you in your spiritual life.
[time=1126] The Living Christmas Tree is about the burst forth with life and these represent probably the busiest days of your life, Pete.
[time=1133] - This has been a very busy time, Rick, but also a time of excitement.
[time=1136] A lot of our people getting their responsibilities completed for the completion of our Living Christmas Tree.
[time=1142] And of course, we're anticipating many of you coming that have tickets to the Living Christmas Tree within the next two weeks.
[time=1149] It's really become quite a tradition and we're excited again to present a son of savior this year.
[time=1154] - I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1155] It's almost miraculous the way the tree goes up.
[time=1159] We have church here this morning, our two services, and then as church ends about 12, 15, a group of volunteers will come together and they'll start constructing the tree today.
[time=1169] And by Thursday morning, it will be ready to go.
[time=1172] And there's a lot of work that is yet to be done but with that work comes the anticipation of sharing with you the Lord Jesus Christ in the music, a son, a savior.
[time=1183] I wish that we could tell you we have lots of tickets and just write or call.
[time=1187] Unfortunately, they've all been given out.
[time=1190] If you want to take your chance and call in case somebody returns some tickets, you're welcome to do that.
[time=1194] But unfortunately, by the time you hear this, we're halfway through the concerts and the tickets have been gone for some time.
[time=1202] But thank you for your interest and for joining us today.
[time=1206] Peter, I'll be praying for you and I'll be here to help out as much as I can but you don't want me to sing.
[time=1211] - Well, probably not this year, maybe another year but we'll worry about that in 88.
[time=1218] - Oh, is that a promise?
[time=1220] - Well, we are thankful for the living Christmas tree and the outreach it gives us to our community.
[time=1225] Also today, we'd like to share this booklet with you entitled A Closer Walk.
[time=1230] Its title represents its purpose.
[time=1232] It's to help you and to help me have a closer walk with God and our Savior.
[time=1238] To draw us into a daily fellowship with him by the habit of daily reading God's Word.
[time=1244] This little booklet is an instructional guide that leads you through a study of the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1250] If you begin with us in 12 months, you will have read through the entire New Testament not only reading God's Word but having this study guide to help you make applications so you can make God's Word relevant to your life today.
[time=1265] We're offering it to you right now during the month of December because we want you to write in today and request this booklet so that on January the 1st, a New Year's resolution could be made saying I'll read God's Word and read the New Testament this year.
[time=1281] This will be the tool that will help you to do that.
[time=1284] We hope you'll write and develop a closer walk by requesting that title a closer walk.
[time=1291] This is indeed a very helpful booklet and we hope that you'll write to us today.
[time=1295] You may write to the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1304] Once again, that's the Bible hour, box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1311] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1313] And again, let me encourage you to write right away so that your letter can get to us and we can send a copy back to you by January the 1st so you can begin the New Year reading God's Word.
[time=1325] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, I would like to solicit your help in praying for our ministry.
[time=1332] Many of you write regularly and tell us you're praying for us and I cannot begin to tell you how much that means to each of us here.
[time=1340] Last night, I had the privilege with my wife of being at a concert in Wabash, Indiana, and Pete, we were sitting there enjoying the concert and one lady came up and said she had watched the Bible hour and the lady in front of her said Bible hour and turned around and talked to Kathy and I and it was just a joyful time knowing so many are watching and receiving encouragement from this ministry.
[time=1361] We'd like to ask you to be partners with us in praying and you could particularly pray with us for our need for new television equipment.
[time=1368] The life expectancy of television equipment like everything else is limited and much of our equipment has already been well-passed.
[time=1376] It's normal lifetime and passed its second lifetime and so in the next year, we're going to need to replace a great deal of equipment.
[time=1384] We could certainly use your partnership in praying.
[time=1386] So we'll ask you to do that and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1390] I do hope you'll write and request a closer walk so we can send it to you.
[time=1394] Thank you for being a part of the Bible hour today.

[time=1545] - Gloria, in Excelsior's Dayo.
[time=1548] Gloria in the highest to God.
[time=1551] God, we've come to this very place today to glorify you.
[time=1556] And it seems inexpressible and inadequate for our words and the thoughts that we have to somehow even comprehend the greatness of who you are.
[time=1566] But we want to shout forth not only in song but in spirit today, that we want you to be glorified and magnified.
[time=1573] As we studied in your word last week, you are worthy, O Lord, of glory and majesty and power and authority before all ages now and forevermore.
[time=1584] And we've come today to praise you.
[time=1588] And we thank you for the privilege of doing that.
[time=1592] And God, we thank you for the fulfillment of life and the purpose we find in our own soul and the satisfaction that comes to us to praise you.
[time=1605] Father, by your spirit today, we ask you to assist our hearts in that very ministry of worship today.
[time=1612] Father, we would ask you by your spirit to minister to the hearts of those who are not able to be with us because of their own health.
[time=1621] We'd pray particularly for the Stutti family as they care for their young son.
[time=1626] We'd pray for Mark Deggitz and his family that you would encourage him day by day.
[time=1632] We would pray for Eleanor Layman, that you would strengthen her in her battle against cancer.
[time=1638] Carol Beebe, she recovers from surgery and complications.
[time=1642] Father, we pray for others who are today and bondage to sin that they might find the great release that comes from confessing and repenting and walking and obedience.
[time=1655] Father, through your word today, we would want to know you and grow in our knowledge.
[time=1661] And as we think of the Lord Jesus at Christmas, we recognize that he is the eternal God, but he came to earth to die for our sins.
[time=1670] Lord Jesus, we thank you that you would humble yourself and become a man and humble yourself and enter this world even as a child.
[time=1678] And we sing to you now, even a lullaby of praise.
[time=1682] In Jesus' name, amen.

[time=1960] (gentle music)
[time=1972] Thank you, Lisa.
[time=1974] As we anticipate Christmas, we anticipate those unique opportunities to consider the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1982] But as we think of Him in a manger, the same wood that melt a manger was disowned, built across on which he would die for our sins.
[time=1991] And there's a line drawn clearly in the Bible from the cradle to the cross.
[time=1998] The purpose of the cradle was that God might come to earth to die on the cross.
[time=2004] Inside our bulletin, we gave you a very general outline of our Bible studies that we'll be conducting.
[time=2011] During this Christmas season, we'll begin today with a study of the life of Christ, which hopefully will culminate with studying the resurrection of Christ on Easter on April the 1st.
[time=2022] So many of you are often wondering where it is we're going.
[time=2026] Usually I have no idea where we're going.
[time=2028] I just come and make up something on Sunday morning.
[time=2031] I wanted to prove to you that wasn't true, regardless of what my wife has said.
[time=2035] We have a plan, we have a purpose, and we're studying the life of Christ.
[time=2039] We finished the book of Jude, and it's really our habit to either systematically study our way through a particular book of the Bible, or to study our way through a biblical theme.
[time=2050] And so the theme that we'll study during these winter months in the spring is the life of Christ.
[time=2056] And so today, if you have your Bible, we invite you to open it to John chapter one.
[time=2062] We'll look at verses one through four today in the Gospel according to John the first chapter.
[time=2069] Allow me to read it for you, and I'm using the new international version.
[time=2074] John one, one.
[time=2076] In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.
[time=2085] He was with God in the beginning.
[time=2088] Through him, all things were made.
[time=2093] Without him, nothing was made that has been made.
[time=2098] In him was life, and that life was the light.
[time=2104] Of men.
[time=2105] For students of the scripture, these are some of the most paradoxical verses in all of the scripture.
[time=2112] Because in some ways, these words are the most simple in the entire Bible, and in other ways, these are the most complex of all the words in the Bible.
[time=2125] We've had a number of people, probably a dozen or two dozen.
[time=2129] In our church, you've gone to Bible college, or seminary, or in some way, they've studied a little bit of the Greek language.
[time=2137] These verses are the beginning elements of Greek.
[time=2142] I mean, you remember back when you had first grade reading, and you said, look, Susie, look, see, skip, run.
[time=2151] Remember those short, little, concise statements, and every word was just one syllable?
[time=2156] That's this stuff in Greek.
[time=2158] I mean, this is the easy stuff.
[time=2161] Simple, grammatically.
[time=2163] And it's just straight, simple sentences.
[time=2166] In the beginning was the word.
[time=2168] The word was with God, the word was God.
[time=2171] It's very repetitious.
[time=2173] You don't have to keep looking up the words.
[time=2175] The word word and the word God, they just keep reoccurring.
[time=2178] Yet in another way, these are the most complex and profound verses of all the scripture.
[time=2184] Because there are three words here that John uses, though simple grammatically.
[time=2188] I mean, they open up a door of deep philosophical study.
[time=2193] Words like light, words like life,
[time=2200] and the word, the word, deep and profound.
[time=2207] And so this morning, we want to look at these, both with their simplicity and their complexity.
[time=2213] But what John is actually trying to do is he's trying to answer two simple questions.
[time=2222] Very philosophical, but indeed practical.
[time=2227] The first question is this one, who is Jesus Christ?
[time=2231] And then based upon your answer to that, a second question, who am I?
[time=2237] Do you remember the rock opera, Jesus Christ, Superstar?
[time=2241] One of the lines was, Jesus Christ, Superstar, are you who they say you are?
[time=2247] The question was asked, who is Jesus Christ?
[time=2252] But that is the question that has not only been asked in a contemporary rock opera, that's the question that comes through the Bible time and time again.
[time=2262] The very first time Jesus taught in his public ministry,
[time=2268] the audience stood back and they said, "Who is this man that he teaches such things?" When Jesus calmed the waves of the sea, the disciples stood back and they said, "Who is this man?" That even the wind and the sea obeys him.
[time=2287] When Jesus healed a paralytic man that was lowered down by his friends through the roof, he says, "Thy sins be forgiven." And the Pharisee said, "Who is this man?" That says such things.
[time=2302] When Jesus was performing miracles, Herod said, "I have beheaded John the Baptist." Who is this man?
[time=2313] When Jesus came riding into Jerusalem
[time=2319] on what we call Palm Sunday for a triumphal entry, the people said, "Who is this man?"
[time=2330] When Christ did before Pilate, Pilate said, "Who are you?" And that's the question we need to ask today.
[time=2342] Who is this man?
[time=2347] Well, John uses three unique terms, unique in their philosophical import, very, very common in their grammatical usage.
[time=2356] Word, life, and light.
[time=2359] Let's follow that as a very simple outline today.
[time=2362] First one says, "In the beginning was the word, "and the word was with God, and the word was God." Around this concept of the word, he gives three simple statements.
[time=2372] In the beginning was the word.
[time=2376] Now the word, let me give you just a little Greek because that's all I really know.
[time=2381] But the word for word is the word logos.
[time=2385] It would be brought into our language, L-O-G-O-S.
[time=2390] And we use that in all kinds of ways.
[time=2393] When you study biology, that is biosulogos.
[time=2398] It is bios, life, logos, the study of life.
[time=2402] When you study geology, you are studying geos, earth, logos, the study of earth.
[time=2410] When you study various things, and ever you put that ology on the end of it, that's our word here, logos.
[time=2416] But it is far more than just a word that means study.
[time=2421] It's a word that means reason, intellect.
[time=2426] But by the time of Homer, 800 BC, this word is beginning to be pulled out of grammar and used very philosophically.
[time=2435] By 500 AD, there's a man by the name of Heraclitus who said, in the world, there is a spirit, there is a principle which controls the universe.
[time=2450] They looked at the universe, and what we would call a very teleological approach, they saw that there was order and dimension and design, and they said there's got to be some principle that stands behind all of this and gives it reason and order.
[time=2465] They called that principle the logos.
[time=2469] By the time you come to the Stoics, let's say 150 to 200 AD, the Stoics taught that this material world had a soul of its own.
[time=2482] There is an all-pervading spirit and power, and the Stoics called that the logos.
[time=2488] Then by the time you come to the Latin writer and leader, Marcus Aurelius, Marcus Aurelius said, "There it is a generative." That means a creative and sustainable.
[time=2500] There is a generative power or force in the universe.
[time=2505] He called it the logos.
[time=2508] So this epistle of John, we call it a gospel, this announcement of good news is written to a Greco-Roman world, Greek and Latin, and into that philosophical concept, he begins to use words that they would understand.
[time=2527] They would call this creative force, this sustaining power, this principle of the universe, they would know it as the logos.
[time=2537] So John would write, and he would say, "In the beginning was the logos." And you can almost picture the Greek mind saying yes.
[time=2550] This principle that created the whole world was in the beginning.
[time=2555] Then the phrase and the logos was with God.
[time=2561] That would bring greater contemplation.
[time=2563] The consider this being is now with God.
[time=2566] The word means face-to-face with God, and then this concept.
[time=2572] The word was God.
[time=2578] Actually, what John has done is he has taken words that were so clear to them, and in the most definitive way he could, he identifies Jesus Christ as the eternal creator God of the world.
[time=2598] Looking at it a phrase at the time, he said, "In the beginning was the word." We would say in a phrase that this phrase teaches his pre-existence.
[time=2611] And the point we wanna make is if you'll allow a continuum of a timeline that there is eternity past, there is eternity future, there is a point on that timeline right here that we would call Bethlehem, the birth of Christ.
[time=2628] And what John is saying is before Bethlehem, before at this point in time that we would call creation, before it all, in the beginning of it all, existed the logos Christ, that he was pre-existent.
[time=2645] And all of scripture lends itself to teaching the pre-existence of Christ.
[time=2650] If you go all the way back to the very first chapter of the Bible, you come to Genesis 1.26 and it says, "God said, let us make man in our image." Now we believe, and the scripture is very clearly teach that God is one God.
[time=2670] Hero Israel, the Lord our God is one God and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all of thy heart, with all of thy soul, and with all of thy might, one God, and yet you come to Genesis 1.26 and God said, "Let us." I'm not a great grammarian, but that's plural.
[time=2688] Make man in our image, that's plural.
[time=2691] Is the Bible here teaching a polytheistic view that there are many gods?
[time=2696] No, it is simply recognizing that the one God exists in a form that we call the Trinity, the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost.
[time=2707] And so God talked to himself, the Father would talk to the Son, the Spirit to the Father, and in that triune relationship, there would be an us, even though it's one.
[time=2720] And that is the preexisting Christ is a part of that us.
[time=2725] In Isaiah chapter nine, verse six, words written by Isaiah put the music by Handel.
[time=2734] It says, "For unto us, a child is born, "and to us a son is given, "and the government shall be upon his shoulders, "and his name shall be called, the Wonderful, "the Counselor, the Mighty God, "the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace." And in that phrase, there are two illusions
[time=2757] to the preexistence of Christ.
[time=2761] First of all, "For unto us, a child is born." At Bethlehem, a little baby was born.
[time=2767] Generation, procreation took place.
[time=2771] That was actually the beginning of life for a baby.
[time=2775] A child was born, but a son was not born.
[time=2778] The son existed in eternity past.
[time=2781] He was not born, he was simply given, he already existed, and he was given.
[time=2787] And the further teach the preexistence of Christ, it says, "And his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor." This one note, "The Mighty God." That puts him at equality with the Mighty God.
[time=2799] And in this phrase, "The Everlasting Father," teaching his eternal dimension, his preexistence.
[time=2806] Mike at chapter five, verse two, gives the clearest teaching, however.
[time=2813] It says in Micah 5, "For out of thee, O Bethlehem, "shall come, who shall rule over my people Israel, "whose goings forth are from days of old and ancient times."
[time=2826] Yes, out of Bethlehem would come one, but this one's coming is not simply out of Bethlehem, but from eternity past.
[time=2833] The Old Testament teaches the preexistence of Christ.
[time=2837] Obviously the New Testament does.
[time=2839] John 1-1 in the beginning was the word.
[time=2842] I like John 1-15 though, because it's almost a play on words.
[time=2847] John the Baptist is testifying, and it says, "John testifies concerning him, "and he cries out saying, "This is the one whom I said will come after me.
[time=2863] "He has surpassed me because he was before me." Now look at my timeline again.
[time=2867] There's the past, there's the future.
[time=2869] John says, "I'm right here, he's gonna come after me, "but he's preferred before me because he came before me." I don't know whether you watch a lot of football, but you ever see the look on the quarterback's face when he takes the snap from center.
[time=2883] He does one of these fancy reverse pivots to hand off to the fullback who's not there.
[time=2889] You know, you just see this quarterback, he's just turning every which way.
[time=2893] That's almost John's expression, he's saying.
[time=2895] Now this Jesus, he was before me, no, he was after me, who is he?
[time=2901] Very simple, John was saying.
[time=2903] In terms of public ministry, he came after I did.
[time=2907] In terms of entrance into physical life, he came after I did.
[time=2912] But in terms of total existence, he was always before me.
[time=2916] The preexistence of Christ.
[time=2919] In the meditation this morning, you saw a lot of Colossians chapter one, that it says that Jesus Christ is preeminent overall because he is before all things.
[time=2934] But in the gospel of John, there are so many illusions that it often speaks of Jesus Christ as the one who came down from heaven.
[time=2944] And for him to have come down from heaven, it meant that he pre-existed in heaven before he came down to earth.
[time=2951] Paul taught the preexistence of Christ.
[time=2954] He said of Jesus Christ in Philippians chapter two, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation and took upon himself the form of a man.
[time=2969] He existed as God before he became a man.
[time=2972] Paul said in second Corinthians chapter eight, verse seven, you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich for your sakes, he became poor.
[time=2984] Jesus became poor when he entered humanity, but before he became poor, he was rich.
[time=2991] The preexistence of Christ.
[time=2995] There are many other verses.
[time=2996] My favorite would be out of Revelation where it said, in Jesus speaking, I am Alpha and Omega.
[time=3004] I am the beginning and the end, the one who is present tense, who was past tense and who always will be future tense.
[time=3016] I am Alpha, I am Omega, the preexistence Christ.
[time=3021] Now we spent, I'm looking at the clock, we spent about 10 minutes talking about the preexistence of Christ.
[time=3029] Why is that?
[time=3030] Because I believe John is building here, he's arguing from the particular to the general.
[time=3036] Harry Truman put it this way.
[time=3037] Truman said to one of his associates, friend, when something looks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, I've got to take into consideration it just may be a duck.
[time=3053] What Truman was saying is when something has all the attributes of a duck, it's probably a duck.
[time=3059] And what John is saying here is that Jesus Christ had the attributes of God.
[time=3065] Conclusion is, he is God.
[time=3068] He's using the particular point that he was the pre-existent one to teach the greater concept, that he comes to in the next phrase, that he was with God and that he was God.
[time=3083] That second phrase that he was with God teaches not only is preexistence, but is independent personality.
[time=3091] That though Jesus is God is the same substance and character of God, that there is a difference in personality between God the Father and God the Son, between God the Son and God the Spirit, between God the Spirit and God the Father.
[time=3105] There are three gods in one.
[time=3108] It is something that doesn't make complete sense to us, but a Chinese proverb puts it this way.
[time=3115] He who tries to define the Trinity loses his mind.
[time=3120] He who denies the Trinity loses his soul.
[time=3124] The Trinity is a mere human attempt in finite words
[time=3131] to describe the infinite God.
[time=3134] Do you ever play games with your kids and they ask questions?
[time=3138] Dad, how many people are in our school?
[time=3143] Well, honey, they're 320 in our school.
[time=3146] Dad, how many people in our church?
[time=3148] Well, honey, it varies 1,500 to 79.
[time=3151] Dad, how many people were there ever in the universe?
[time=3155] Oh, Rachel, I don't know.
[time=3156] Well, how many?
[time=3158] You know, as though I can think that up.
[time=3160] Dad, how far is it to Georgetown?
[time=3162] It's about one mile.
[time=3163] How far is it to Grandma's house?
[time=3165] Oh, it's about 200 miles.
[time=3167] Dad, how far is it to God's house?
[time=3170] How do you describe that?
[time=3172] Well, honey, it's so many light years away and we think, how do you describe those things?
[time=3178] There are certain things that go beyond our ability to describe.
[time=3181] And the one thing that goes far beyond our ability to describe is God.
[time=3187] And Paul said, all the unsearchable riches of the greatness of our God, he is past finding out.
[time=3197] Part of that is that he is so splendid that he is one existing in three and this teaches the independent personality of Jesus because he wasn't just God, he was with God.
[time=3209] Then the third phrase, he was God.
[time=3213] Clearest, most concise statement of all.
[time=3218] Jesus was God.
[time=3222] It's what we would call a predicate nomative.
[time=3226] Jesus is God.
[time=3229] Allow me to use myself as an illustration.
[time=3232] You can say, Rick is the speaker today or you can say, the speaker today is Rick.
[time=3241] They're interchangeable.
[time=3242] And John says he's not only preexisting, he's not only independent personality, he's actually God himself.
[time=3249] And that was the concept, the word.
[time=3253] And it came alive in verse 14.
[time=3256] Something the Greeks never contemplated.
[time=3258] Something the Romans would never understand is that this word actually became flesh and dwelt amongst us.
[time=3267] That this force, this principle, this God overall actually became a man.
[time=3275] And that's the story of God's gospel given to John.
[time=3281] The word became flesh.
[time=3284] What did the word do?
[time=3285] Well, one thing it tells us is that he created everything.
[time=3288] And there wasn't anything that was made that was not made by him.
[time=3294] That is so important because there will be groups such as the Jehovah Witness who will teach that Jesus is not God.
[time=3304] They will teach that Jesus was a being, an angel created by God, but not God.
[time=3312] This verse disallows that.
[time=3315] First of all, it says he is God.
[time=3316] Then it says he was in the beginning with God and his term beginning means before creation.
[time=3321] Then he says everything that was created was created by him.
[time=3326] Jesus cannot be an angel because an angel is a created being.
[time=3330] And he doubles the point by saying, no, nothing that exists was created apart from him.
[time=3337] Second word that we come to for part of a theme is this word life.
[time=3342] Two very simple words in Greek defined life.
[time=3345] Bios from which we get biology, zoe from which we get zoology.
[time=3351] John likes the word zoe.
[time=3353] It speaks of existence.
[time=3356] Biology speaks of particular existence in particular form, but zoe speaks of life.
[time=3362] Perhaps it's more of a philosophical word that John is using.
[time=3366] The speak of life with its purpose and its meaning.
[time=3370] Not simply raw biology, but of its purpose.
[time=3374] And John here says in him was life.
[time=3377] Not only was he the creator, but he was the reason for life himself.
[time=3382] That life was simply that extension of himself.
[time=3387] It was created by him and for him.
[time=3391] Said the Apostle Paul.
[time=3392] "And life has its meaning in Christ." And the life verse four gives us the third word.
[time=3400] It was the light of men.
[time=3402] Folks from which we get photography, photograph, photogenic, photosynthesis.
[time=3408] It's the word that means light.
[time=3410] And it speaks of more than simply rays of illumination.
[time=3414] It speaks of the bat which drives out darkness.
[time=3418] It speaks of that which illuminates and gives not only sight and perception, but understanding of the mind and the heart.
[time=3425] It speaks of direction.
[time=3427] Jesus said, "I am the post." The light of the world.
[time=3432] He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
[time=3439] Music often brings to us good philosophical questions.
[time=3446] As a student in high school, I remember a song by the Moody Blues.
[time=3449] And it said, "I'm looking for someone to change my life.
[time=3452] "I'm looking for a miracle in my life." Chicago sang and I have been searching so long.
[time=3459] The fine the answer to the questions.
[time=3461] Who am I?
[time=3462] And to know whether my life has meaning.
[time=3465] Man throughout the ages has looked for one who could give life.
[time=3473] Not by us, but meaning.
[time=3476] Shakespeare put these words in the mouth of his Macbeth.
[time=3481] Life is but a walking shadow.
[time=3485] A poor player that struts and frets for his hour upon the stage.
[time=3490] And then is heard.
[time=3491] No more.
[time=3493] It is a tale told by an idiot.
[time=3496] Mirror, sound and fury.
[time=3501] It signifies nothing.
[time=3503] Is that life?
[time=3505] Oh no.
[time=3506] There's one in whom there is life and light.
[time=3509] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music
[time=3518] from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and our high school ensemble mirror from Black Hawk Christian School and soloist Lisa McIntosh.
[time=3527] The message from God's word was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3530] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to pray this prayer with you right now.
[time=3537] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3539] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3548] And today life takes on new meaning as I realize that you have come to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3555] I ask you to do that today and come into my heart.
[time=3558] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
