[time=114] Prophecy is the identifying mark that God gave for His Son, the Messiah, our Savior.
[time=122] Peter Stoner has calculated the probability of Jesus just fulfilling eight of the hundreds of prophecies about Him are one times ten to the 17th power.
[time=135] Now, if you're like me and not a great mathematician, that one times ten to the 17th power doesn't really make sense.
[time=142] Here's an illustration to show you how impossible it is for Jesus to coincidentally fulfill Messianic prophecy.
[time=151] One times ten to the 17th power is like taking one silver dollar, marking an X on it, and then throwing it into a pile of silver dollars, two foot deep, the size of the state of Texas,
[time=164] then taking a man who's blind, letting him wander around and pick up just one silver dollar, and that be the one with the X.
[time=173] It was impossible for it to happen coincidentally. It was impossible for Jesus to fulfill Messianic prophecy coincidentally.

[time=193] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=200] Rick's message today is entitled "A Son, a Savior, His Prophetic Visit."
[time=206] God promised that one day He would send a Messiah, a Savior.
[time=210] In order to identify Him, God gave advanced descriptions of His Messiah through the Old Testament prophets.
[time=216] They foretold the place of His birth, His lineage, His ministry and message, His hometown, His triumphal entry, His manner of death and resurrection, and many more distinguishing marks.
[time=228] It is God's desire that no one missed the opportunity to recognize His Messiah, our Savior.
[time=234] Today in our study in the life of Christ we will be examining several of the prophecies concerning the birth of Christ.
[time=241] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=246] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us from the living Christmas tree.
[time=252] Other music includes a musical package from the children's choir and carols by the handbell choir.
[time=261] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=270] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=274] Now, here's Rick.
[time=276] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us now by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=281] We trust that God will use this service this morning in your life to bring to your mind and to your heart the realization that Jesus Christ is the Lord and the King of Glory.

[time=532] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=677] Thank you very much for your angelic singing.
[time=683] Now, speaking of angels, they're just over here on the side set.
[time=688] It's kind of a thrill, really, to see them pronouncing the birth of our Savior.
[time=692] We can all remember church plays of the past that stuck in our minds and reminded us of the fact that we celebrate this season and there are many things to distract us from the real meaning of Christmas.
[time=705] But now, as the children sing, they will present to you again the fact that Jesus indeed came to be our Savior.
[time=712] Jerry Johnson is the director along with Carol Coby and Jennifer Vaughn.
[time=716] Let's listen to our children's choir now as they sing for us.
[time=721] [MUSIC - 98 seconds]
[time=821] [APPLAUSE]
[time=828] Well, I'm so excited. I can't believe that Christmas is really almost here.
[time=832] I know, you can almost smell it in the air.
[time=834] Hi, Mike. Made your list of Christmas gifts yet?
[time=837] Oh, I know what I'm getting all right.
[time=839] Ever since last Christmas, I've been making my list. I even checked it twice.
[time=843] And here it is.
[time=845] Hi, kids. What are you doing?
[time=847] Oh, we were just having a discussion on how much we are getting for Christmas.
[time=851] Christmas is so exciting. It's not just what you're getting, though.
[time=855] It's thinking about others. You know, peace on earth, good will toward man.
[time=859] The Christmas story.
[time=861] All right, Mrs. Johnson. Christmas is a time to share a lot of love with family and friends.
[time=865] It's also a time to share the story of that first Christmas.
[time=869] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=1007] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1014] The Gospel of Luke tells us that on that special night, Mary gave birth to her firstborn son.
[time=1020] Wrapped him in swollen clothes and laid him in a stable with all the animals nearby.
[time=1026] [MUSIC] In Bethlehem was a baby born on a Christmas evening. [MUSIC] And the animals that stood nearby saw you day were singing. [MUSIC] And the donkey said, "Keep home, Merry Christmas, Jesus." [MUSIC] And the cow said, "Ooh, ooh, Merry Christmas, Jesus." [MUSIC] And I always wondered why the baby didn't cry. [MUSIC] 'Cause the animals they sang their song. [MUSIC] A Christmas lullaby. [MUSIC] A Christmas lullaby. [MUSIC] In Bethlehem was in the sky. [MUSIC] A bright star, it was shining. [MUSIC] And the wires made it came from far and wide. [MUSIC] The presents they weren't bringing. [MUSIC] And the dogs sang, "Ooh, ooh, Merry Christmas, Jesus." [MUSIC] And the lambs sang, "Pah, bah, Merry Christmas, Jesus." [MUSIC] And they always wondered why the baby didn't cry. [MUSIC] 'Cause the animals they sang their song. [MUSIC] A Christmas lullaby. [MUSIC] A Christmas lullaby. [MUSIC]
[time=1111] [MUSIC - 43 seconds]

[time=1171] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=1228] 105 sing choirs of angels.
[time=1233] [MUSIC - 98 seconds]
[time=1338] Boy, you were a big boy.
[time=1342] How high did you go? Did you really?
[time=1346] Oh, man, you're a big guy.
[time=1349] Good morning. This is my son, Adam.
[time=1352] And he and I had the privilege of working together with hundreds of people to build the living Christmas tree.
[time=1358] This was your first year to help, wasn't it, buddy? You did a good job.
[time=1362] He is so precious to me. He and I have lots of fun together.
[time=1366] We play a game that we call "stuck wrestle." That's where we wrestle until I get a good grip on him and I don't let him go until he gives me a big hug and a kiss.
[time=1374] He's the joy of my life and I couldn't imagine for a moment giving him up.
[time=1379] When I think of what God did for us at Christmas, it's overwhelming.
[time=1384] To think that God gave up his son first he gave him up to come into the world as a baby.
[time=1391] And then he gave him up a second time when he allowed him to die on the cross for our sins.
[time=1397] That's beyond comprehension for me.
[time=1400] This little guy is my buddy and he's precious and we have so much fun together.
[time=1404] I couldn't imagine for a moment being separated from him for thirty-some years and then watching him die.
[time=1411] It's inexpressible, the love that God has for us.
[time=1414] And we hope that more than anything else, you sense that God loves you this Christmas season.
[time=1420] We're in the midst of a concert series of fourteen living Christmas tree concerts.
[time=1425] We wish that Adam and I could invite you all to come over today and enjoy the concerts with us.
[time=1430] But unfortunately the tickets are all gone. They've been gone for some time.
[time=1434] But we're delighted that today by way of television and next Sunday as well we'll be able to share the living Christmas tree with you.
[time=1442] And we hope it's as much a blessing to you friends who watch by way of television as it is for those of us who are here sharing it with you.
[time=1450] Along with sharing the living Christmas tree we have a booklet for you today entitled A Closer Walk.
[time=1456] This is a daily Bible study guide that helps each of us study the New Testament by covering the gospels, the epistles and the books of the entire New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1469] It has such an appropriate name, A Closer Walk.
[time=1472] That's what God wants to have with you and with me.
[time=1475] A Closer Walk. Just like Adam and I walk together through life, God says as our Heavenly Father he wants to walk with us.
[time=1484] But the only way that can be achieved is if we spend time with him and this booklet will help you to do that.
[time=1491] We're offering it to you now in December so that as the New Year comes around you can make a New Year's resolution to have a closer walk with God.
[time=1499] If you'd like a copy of this please write to us today and we'll be glad to send you your first copy.
[time=1506] Simply write to us at the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1517] Once again the address is the Bible hour, box 15,000 Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1527] And then when you write to us simply request the booklet entitled "Closer Walk" and we'll send it to you just as quickly as we can.
[time=1535] We want you to have it. We want you to be in God's Word. We want you to have a closer walk with the Heavenly Father.
[time=1542] Also we would like to ask your help in praying for our television ministry.
[time=1547] Every concert I meet dozens of people who I've never met before who say they know who I am because like you they watch the Bible hour.
[time=1556] We need your prayers for this ministry for its future as we are endeavoring to purchase some very important and very essential new equipment
[time=1564] so we would ask your help in praying and being partners with us in that way.
[time=1569] Next Sunday morning I'm looking forward to Kathy and my two daughters along with Adam joining us here on the Bible hour
[time=1576] and then the following Sunday we're going to entice the Kobe family to come in.
[time=1580] We just love our families and love having the privilege of sharing them with you and hope that just a little family time makes your family enjoy Christmas just a little bit more.
[time=1592] In a few moments we'll go back to the morning worship service but before we go Adam and I have a message for you and that is Merry Christmas.
[time=1610] [MUSIC - 176 seconds]
[time=1796] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1809] That traditional sound of the bells gives us great anticipation, not only anticipation of antiquity that Jesus would come but today declaration that he can come into our lives.
[time=1822] Thank you for worshiping with us this morning and now I would like to invite you to bow with us in prayer.
[time=1829] Our God this morning we have sung and lifted our voices and we have sang "Oh come all you faithful, joyful and triumphant."
[time=1838] And today God there is a triumphancy about our march as we announce that Jesus Christ is alive and we've come to worship him today and so we pray as David did pray.
[time=1850] May the words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts be acceptable and thy side.
[time=1857] Oh God our rock and our Creator we want to worship you. We want to praise you not only in this designated hour of worship but by the very character and conduct of our lives.
[time=1872] May we be a marked people, marked as believers in Christ not because of our attendance in a service but because of the walk of integrity and the winsomeness of countenance.
[time=1886] Father today may this world see that Jesus is real, that he is the Christ because they see him in us.
[time=1895] Father this morning we pray that you would use this hour in the living Christmas tree each service today to encourage hearts in their search to know Christ.
[time=1907] May there be those this morning who give their heart to him.
[time=1911] Father we pray you would use this hour to encourage those who carry deep burdens.
[time=1917] We pray today for families who are suffering today particularly for Jim and Heather Hutcheson and the loss of Jim's stepfather.
[time=1928] We pray for Jim and his family but particularly his mother who has lost her partner in life that you might comfort them.
[time=1936] We pray that you would give Jim strength and also opportunity to represent Christ in a home.
[time=1943] Father we would pray today for the family of a police candidate who was accidentally shot and for those involved in the grief in their hearts that you would comfort and give healing to damage damaged relationships.
[time=1957] Father we pray for families that during this season when we sit around tables together that you might restore children and parents and perhaps husbands and wives.
[time=1968] Father most of all we pray that there would be those who would be restored to you this day in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=1979] During the days of the Roman occupation of Israel a number of political forces each led by their own rebel leader tried to bring about a purging of all of Israel's enemies from the land.
[time=1994] Some of them like Judas Maccabeus became great figures of prominence and some of them like Simon Bar Copa even announced that he was the long-awaited Messiah of Israel.
[time=2008] During the days of the Hasmoneans there would also be those who would claim for themselves the title of Messiah.
[time=2016] There was one of the line of the Hasmoneans another of the line of the Maccabeans there was this Jesus of Nazareth who also claimed to be the Messiah and Simon Bar Copa who similarly said he too was the Messiah.
[time=2031] Then there was Joachim Aflora who had a messenger who was a forerunner who went from village to village announcing Messiah Joachim would come and then there was in the 1800s this American by the name of Slater in Illinois who too said he was the Messiah.
[time=2049] And now this other individual from Korea who announces that he is the Lord of the Second Advent, son Mayung Moon claiming he too is the Messiah.
[time=2061] Well a student of history will quickly point out that these are only a few of the many people who have lived who have claimed that they were the fulfillment of Israel's expectation of a Messiah.
[time=2077] Why is it this Sunday morning we say that Simon Bar Copa was a criminal rebel and Jesus of Nazareth he was the Messiah.
[time=2088] Why is it that I snicker in my own thinking when I think of Joachim Aflora and I become disgusted when I think of son Mayung Moon but I become a leader when I think of Jesus Christ.
[time=2101] Why is it this morning that all of these people have claimed to be the Messiah we today say it was this one Jesus who was the Messiah.
[time=2113] Well if you have your Bible we're studying through the life of Christ and I invite you to open your Bible to Matthew chapter 1 and we're going to steal some key phrases out of chapters 1 and 2 this morning to discover that Jesus is the Messiah.
[time=2128] And more than Messiah to understand that that term speaks of one who was actually God visiting man in human form.
[time=2138] Let me steal just a few phrases out of chapters 1 and 2.
[time=2143] In chapter 1 verse 22 it makes this statement all this took place to fulfill what the Lord said through the prophet.
[time=2154] Hang on to that thought and turn to chapter 2 verse 5.
[time=2160] In Bethlehem in Judea they replied for this is what the prophet has written.
[time=2168] Now jump down to verse 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod and soul was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet of verse 17.
[time=2185] Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled and verse 23 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth so was fulfilled what was said through the prophets.
[time=2206] Now you probably have picked up the common thread that I've extracted out of these two chapters.
[time=2212] Several times Matthew tells us that what he is writing about comes as fulfillment of prophetic identification.
[time=2222] First of all this morning if you want three points here's the first point the purpose of prophecy.
[time=2229] Prophecy has as this single purpose to give us declaration and identification of God's plan of salvation.
[time=2240] It's estimated that there are five billion people on earth today, five billion of them.
[time=2249] Someone said that everywhere in the world a child is being born and at every moment there is a woman somewhere giving birth to a child and we ought to find her and put a stop to it.
[time=2262] But there are five billion of us here on earth today and we've probably been preceded by another three or four billion who've already lived and died.
[time=2272] The world's total population may have been somewhere between eight and ten billion people and out of those billions of people how do we know that that one is the Messiah and all the others are not.
[time=2286] God said I will give you an identification of my Messiah and in the pages of the Old Testament those first thirty nine books according to William Graham Scroggy, a fine student of the Scriptures, there are over three hundred prophecies that Jesus Christ fulfilled that identifies him as the Messiah.
[time=2314] In John chapter five in verse thirty nine Jesus challenged his friends and his enemies alike to do one thing.
[time=2322] He said you search the Scriptures for they are which testify of me.
[time=2329] That was a bold and daring statement and an invitation to investigation.
[time=2334] Jesus said you want proof that I am the Messiah turn to the Scriptures he was referring to the Old Testament and he said they testify about me.
[time=2346] The whole purpose of prophecy is for God to identify ahead of time his divine plan of salvation so that you and I would have the ability to recognize it.
[time=2357] It's like giving a description I told this at the living Christmas tree it's one of my favorite stories.
[time=2363] Two o'clock Saturday afternoons we have the senior adult concert we bring the super sixty's the buses the vans roll anything that has wheels rolls and it brings senior adults here.
[time=2374] The place is filled with thirteen hundred people probably a thousand or more of them are senior citizens and most of them women.
[time=2381] A young man about my age comes into the tunnel over here and he's looking rather desperate and he says to the ushers I need some help I need to find my mother.
[time=2390] The usher said well help us describe her he said she's an older lady with gray hair and glasses.
[time=2398] That really pinned her down to one of 999 of the thousand descriptions help you to identify a particular person.
[time=2410] Now let me use an illustration of that let me begin to describe a person and you determine whether you can figure out who this person happened to be.
[time=2420] This individual was born in the United States of America he lived during the 1700s he had a home called Mount Vernon.
[time=2432] On one time he is reported to have taken a silver dollar and pitched it across the Potomac River a few of us have been looking on the opposite bank for a number of years.
[time=2443] This individual became the first president in the United States of whom am I speaking Abraham Lincoln you're absolutely right.
[time=2452] One guy leaned over his wife and said is that Lincoln I thought for sure it was Jefferson.
[time=2458] We gave a description and by that description your mind zeroed in on George Washington.
[time=2465] What God has done in the Old Testament as he said I'm going to give you a description not in hindsight but in foresight I'm going to describe the Messiah so that when he comes you'll be able to say this is he of whom the prophets have foretold.
[time=2481] And so they gave us some very specific things like where he was born who his parents would be what his name would be circumstances around his birth the nature of his death his denial and his betrayal for 30 pieces of silver his hands and feet being pierced his side being broken open.
[time=2500] It gives over 300 prophecies of the description of Messiah so we would say that's the individual.
[time=2508] I believe the theme of Matthew chapters one and two give us a number of prophecies certainly limited to his birth that help us to say this one he is Messiah.
[time=2523] He is the Christ he is God come to earth. Well if you have your Bible turned to Matthew chapter one and I'm going to read the first four or five verses and just want you to sit back and enjoy the blessing of these verses.
[time=2540] Matthew one one a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
[time=2559] Judah the father Peyres and Zira whose mother was Tamar. Peyres the father of Hezron and Hezron the father of Ram and Ram the father of Amenadab and Amenadab the father of Naishan and Naishan the father of Salmon.
[time=2578] How many of you when you're discouraged you turn to this passage just for the comfort of God's word. How many of you have taken this and you have memorized it because it's that authority of God's word that comforts you. Anybody memorize this passage?
[time=2593] Say man that's the stuff I avoid. You know what if you were Hebrew this would be the stuff you would concentrate on. Let me tell you why. What Matthew is doing here is he's giving us a selective genealogy of the Messiah and nestled in the pages of the Old Testament where prophetic statements that centered on the genealogy of Messiah.
[time=2618] And so these names rang on familiar tune on ears that were prepared to hear of the coming of Messiah.
[time=2628] I want to give you four groupings of prophecies about the birth of Messiah. The first grouping centers around His ancestry. Back in Genesis chapter 12 we come across an individual by the name of Abraham who all of his life had wanted a son and had none.
[time=2647] And God comes to him and he makes him a threefold promise. Promise number one is Abraham you are going to have a son.
[time=2658] Promise number two your descendants will be as numerous as the stars of the heaven and as plenty as the grains of sand on the sea. And promise number three was this one and from your seed will come one from whom all the nations of the world.
[time=2676] Shall be blessed. Three promises the third one is perhaps just a tad bit unclear that from your line your lineage your seed would come one individual from whom all the nations of the world would be blessed.
[time=2693] It was very clear to the Hebrew mind that that was a messianic prophecy a prophecy about the Messiah that was saying Abraham out of your line will come the one who blesses the world the Messiah.
[time=2706] And so we here have a fulfillment of prophecy that Jesus was a son direct lineage of Abraham. Out of the eight to ten billion people who have lived we've now narrowed it down to one select group of people one ethnic group if you will the group that we call the children of Abraham.
[time=2733] Here's a second prophecy in Genesis 26 the prophecy given to Abraham as father was then given to his son Isaac and Isaac was told the same thing.
[time=2745] And now we're told here Abraham was the father of Isaac and Isaac the father of Jacob and you come right down the line till you come to Jesus.
[time=2753] So now we have a narrowing here is Abraham we've narrowed all of humanity down to two lines Abraham's sons he had two sons Ishmael and Isaac but we now have narrowed it down to Isaac.
[time=2770] And then we have a prophecy that comes out of the pages of number that says the line of Messiah will be out of Jacob.
[time=2780] So Isaac had two sons one was Jacob and one was Esalt we've narrowed the track again to the line of Jacob.
[time=2792] In Numbers chapter 24 it says this identification of Messiah I see him but not now I behold him but not near that's saying I see it but it's future.
[time=2809] A star will come out of Jacob and a scepter will rise out of Israel.
[time=2815] Then in Genesis 49 10 it says the scepter will not depart from Judah nor its rulers staff from between his feet.
[time=2824] That breaks and narrows all of the prophecies down from all of the children of Jacob a dozen to one Judah.
[time=2836] And this genealogy is identifying an ever narrowing circle of the ancestry of Jesus Christ so that we would know before he was ever born of what family should he be.
[time=2849] In many ways it's like announcing his last name by giving his ancestry.
[time=2856] Let me just identify one fifth ancestor here and that ancestor is found in verse 6 and Jesse the father of King David David was father of Solomon.
[time=2868] It was said repeatedly in the Psalms and in Isaiah and in 2 Samuel that the Messiah would be of the house and the lineage of David.
[time=2878] Isaiah 9 7 of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end he will reign on David's throne.
[time=2887] What we are doing today is we're demonstrating that Jesus is identified as Messiah in advance by his ancestry.
[time=2897] Then when you come to verses 18 through 25 you have a different identification.
[time=2902] This identification is the fulfillment of Isaiah 7 14.
[time=2907] Isaiah 7 14 says a sign shall be given to you.
[time=2911] A virgin shall conceive and be with child and thou shall call his name a manual.
[time=2919] That announcement is a miraculous birth called the virgin birth.
[time=2926] It was foretold by Isaiah and Matthew tells us in five different expressions Jesus was born of a virgin.
[time=2935] If you look at Matthew chapter 1 verse 18 we discover the virgin birth this phrase before they came together.
[time=2944] That's a euphemism for sexual relationships.
[time=2948] Mary was a virgin before they came together.
[time=2951] A second expression she was found of child of the Holy Ghost.
[time=2955] A third expression in verse 20 that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[time=2962] A third expression verse 23 she was a virgin.
[time=2966] A fourth expression she had no union with Joseph until the child was born.
[time=2972] Now I've been exposed to a variety of teachings and one of those I would have to label as liberal
[time=2979] and it's an attempt to deny the deity of Christ by denying his virgin birth.
[time=2984] And scholars of that thought announced that the Hebrew word in Isaiah 7 14 is the phrase ha-ama.
[time=2992] And ha-ama means a young maiden with no reference to her chastity.
[time=2999] It could be a young maiden who is pure but it may mean a woman who was simply unmarried and has no reference to her purity.
[time=3007] She may have indeed been very promiscuous and impure ha-ama does not necessarily mean virgin.
[time=3015] And I have to concede that they are right.
[time=3018] The word ha-ama simply means an unmarried woman.
[time=3022] However to simply try to deny the virgin birth at that point is a bit ludicrous for two reasons.
[time=3028] First of all Isaiah reads like this behold a sign will be given a woman shall conceive.
[time=3038] And if you take out the virginity of his mother you have no sign.
[time=3043] That would be like me coming to you today and say ladies and gentlemen a miracle has happened here in Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=3051] from the first time at Parkview Hospital you're not going to believe it a lady gave birth to a baby.
[time=3059] You're not impressed with that miracle.
[time=3063] There are babies born every day at Parkview Hospital and to the best of our knowledge every mother has been a lady.
[time=3074] There's not anything miraculous about a lady conceiving and giving birth.
[time=3079] Matter of fact they're not only born every day at that hospital they're born every hour.
[time=3084] I saw Dr. Graham there one night he delivers baby and he looked tired and I said you have a lot of babies being delivered
[time=3091] he said if you got a basket you can help catch him.
[time=3096] There's not anything in Isaiah that refers to a sign if you take out the virginity of the mother.
[time=3104] But even more clear when you come to the New Testament it's not written in Hebrew it's written in Greek and the word that Matthew chooses
[time=3111] is not a word that could be of an impure woman it's a word that speaks of sexual purity and virginity.
[time=3121] The sign is given of a virgin birth Jesus alone carries that prophetic sign.
[time=3128] A third area that we can circle our attention around are the names that are given.
[time=3134] It's said in Matthew chapter 1 that you shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people.
[time=3140] In Psalm 9 verse 14 it says that I may declare your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion and their rejoice in your salvation.
[time=3152] You say wait a minute I didn't hear the name Jesus there well the name salvation the word salvation is this word Yeshua.
[time=3161] Yeshua is Hebrew we pronounce that YAH with a J and we don't call it Yeshua we call it Joshua and Joshua means the Lord's salvation
[time=3172] and the Greek form of Joshua is Yesus which we pronounce in English Jesus.
[time=3180] I shall call his name Yeshua Joshua Jesus and in Isaiah 7 14 I shall call his name a man you will.
[time=3189] Two more prophecies given in advance to identify the Messiah.
[time=3194] Now very quickly out of chapter 2 let me give you 5 prophecies about Messiah these all center around the circumstances of his birth.
[time=3204] We had prophecies about his ancestry prophecies of the virgin birth prophecies about his name and these about the circumstances of his birth.
[time=3213] First of all it says in chapter 5 that Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.
[time=3220] Micah the prophet in chapter 5 verse 2 and Matthew quotes it here but you Bethlehem in the land of Judah by no means the least among the rulers of Judah
[time=3230] for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.
[time=3235] Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. A second prophecy centers around the visit of nobility.
[time=3242] In Isaiah chapter 60 it tells us that nobility the New Testament uses the word Magi would make a visit to the nativity of the Messiah.
[time=3254] Let me read three verses for you this is Isaiah 60 verse 3 nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn the visit of nobility.
[time=3265] Verse 6 herds of camels will cover your land young camels of Midian and Avifra and from Sheba will come bearing gold and incense and proclaiming the praise of the Lord.
[time=3279] Verse 9 surely the islands look to me in the land are the ships of Tarshish bringing your sons from afar and with silver and gold to honor the Lord your God the holy one of Israel.
[time=3294] Isaiah prophesied nobility would come to the nativity of Messiah kings bearing gifts and their even name it's confirmed in the New Testament.
[time=3305] A third circumstance is Hosiah 11 one said that the Messiah would somehow be called out of Egypt.
[time=3313] We discover that Herod is wanting to kill the child and so the family flees to Egypt. It's called the flight to Egypt.
[time=3321] In Sunday school a group of children were asked to draw their favorite story about Jesus one little boy drew an airplane put a man in the cockpit a man in the back a lady in the back and a baby.
[time=3332] Teacher said well honey that's a beautiful picture but that doesn't mean anything to do with Jesus. He said yes it does.
[time=3337] She said well there are no airplanes in those days. He said yes there were. Don't you remember the flight to Egypt?
[time=3345] She said well who's this guy? Well that's Joseph and that's Mary and that's Jesus.
[time=3350] Well she said who's that guy? Little boy looked there like she didn't know her Bible and he said well that's Pontius the pilot.
[time=3359] That wasn't exactly how the flight to Egypt was scheduled.
[time=3363] It was simply that Joseph and Mary fled probably on camel and foot but they went to Egypt and there they hid from the wrath of Herod.
[time=3372] And while they were hiding there it fulfilled a prophecy that God said I'll call my son out of Egypt.
[time=3378] A fourth prophecy is the suffering in Raima. It's found here in Matthew chapter 2 verses 17 through 18 and it was prophesied by Jeremiah centuries before 600 years before the suffering in Raima.
[time=3393] And then finally that he would be a Nazarene the stem of the word nester for scepter out of the book of Isaiah is taken to mean that he would be a Nazarene.
[time=3403] Complicated prophecy not one of the clearest ones so we would build our case on the others.
[time=3409] But this morning what have we been driving to? We've been using these 13 prophecies that surround the birth of Messiah and only alluding to the other nearly 300 about his life and death to say that that's why we believe that Jesus is the Messiah.
[time=3429] Not son Mayung Moon, not Simon Barcopa, not Joachim Aflory, not a Maccabean or Hasmonean but Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=3439] For he alone carries the birth marks that God said he would give to his son our Savior.
[time=3448] What we've talked about the purpose of prophecy today we've talked about prophetic fulfillment and now let me bring to you a third point a problem to be resolved.
[time=3459] You see with all of this evidence and this is merely the tip of the iceberg that poses this personal problem.
[time=3468] You and I must either accept that Jesus is the Messiah the Savior and give our life and our allegiance fully to him or we must reject him as Messiah and Savior in Lord.
[time=3485] You see many of you were better off before you came in today because out of ignorance you could hide but once you've been exposed to the light God says you're accountable for the light you've received.
[time=3497] The problem is will you reject or will you accept Jesus as your Messiah?
[time=3510] We've been sharing with you today the music from the living Christmas tree in our sanctuary choir and the children's choir and our handbell choir.
[time=3518] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3521] All of the music in the message today spoke of the coming of the Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=3526] You can know him as your personal Savior today if you'll bow your head and pray this prayer with me.
[time=3531] If you have that need will you bow right now and pray with me?
[time=3536] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to come into the world to die for our sins.
[time=3544] And as children we can just come to you with complete faith understanding that you died for us and that you'll forgive us of our sins if we but ask.
[time=3553] So I ask you today to come into my heart and to forgive me of my sins and cleanse me.
[time=3559] In Jesus' name I pray amen.
[time=3563] If you prayed that prayer this morning would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3568] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
