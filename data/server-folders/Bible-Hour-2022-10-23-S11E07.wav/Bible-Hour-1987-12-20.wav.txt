[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=90] As believers in Christ, it is important for us to remember, in the face of adversity and
[time=109] even tragedy, that with God there are no accidents, there are no mistakes.
[time=115] Abraham Lincoln told us as a nation, "God governs in the affairs of men."
[time=126] (music)
[time=132] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=135] Thank you for joining us.
[time=136] Rick's message today is entitled, "A Son, a Savior, His Preparation." Like a suspenseful drama, God, the ultimate scriptwriter, prepared the people, the place,
[time=147] and the period of time for the entrance of His Son into the world.
[time=151] Anticipation was felt by all creation.
[time=153] God's sovereign hand was working all things according to the counsel of His own will.
[time=158] In the words of Paul, "The fullness of time had come." The curtain was about to rise on the divine drama of redemption.
[time=165] The anticipation was mounting.
[time=168] Israel was looking for a Messiah, the forerunner, John the Baptist, was born.
[time=172] The anticipation was overpowering, and Angel has appeared separately to Mary and Joseph announcing the coming of a Savior.
[time=179] The anticipation was fulfilled.
[time=181] He is born.
[time=183] In the preparations for Christ's coming, God's all-controlling influence on the world is clear.
[time=189] In it we see a valuable lesson for us today.
[time=192] God works in our lives.
[time=193] With Him, there are no accidents and no mistakes.
[time=197] We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study along with us.
[time=202] Special music today will be brought to us by the Teen Choir and the Bethlehem Brass.
[time=209] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=216] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=221] Now here's Rick.
[time=222] Talk Baptist Church, we also want to welcome our friends who are joining us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=229] On this holiday weekend we have a number of guests, perhaps people who will call Black Hawk home, have family members in from out of town.
[time=237] We've seen people who used to live here have moved away back for a visit, but it's just good to see some familiar faces, too.
[time=244] Some of you are here every Sunday, and we're just as excited to see you.
[time=249] On this week in which we celebrate the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, we have the privilege of hearing our team choir sing from the Living Christmas Tree, a medley of songs that speak
[time=260] about the fact that Jesus Christ is our Savior, and he had the name of Manuel, which means
[time=266] God is with us.
[time=279] [MUSIC - 366 seconds]
[time=663] [APPLAUSE]
[time=673] I'm grateful indeed that the Bible records the singing of the angels pronouncing the birth.
[time=678] It's a great privilege to sing the announcement that Jesus Christ our Savior has come.
[time=683] Let's join the choir singing 109.
[time=686] It came upon a midnight clear and we'll sing the first, second, and fourths stands us together 109.
[time=693] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=835] Hello again and thank you for joining us today here on the Bible Hour.
[time=845] It's a privilege for me today not only to share with your family but to share together with my family.
[time=851] We've come in early so we could just share a brief Christmas greeting with each of you.
[time=856] We hope that this past weekend has been a delightful time for you and your family and you had a joyous Christmas season.
[time=863] This is my wife Kathy and she's got Adam on her lap. She's going to introduce our children.
[time=868] Rick, it's a privilege to introduce our children. They just make the season quite a bit more happy for us.
[time=874] One of the things that we're really thankful for is our daughter Rachel, who's just turned eight years old,
[time=880] and Rachel's in second grade at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=883] We're so thankful that they're able to go to Black Hawk Christian School and have such excellent teaching.
[time=888] Mrs. Zooka's her teacher and she's now only taught them great responsibility as second graders but she's taught them a lot of scripture.
[time=895] Rachel, why don't you quote one of the verses that you've learned this Christmas in school, okay?
[time=901] Matthew 121, she will give birth to us and you are to give them the name Jesus because he will save his people from their sins.
[time=909] Oh, that's a good job, Rachel. Thanks.
[time=911] And Rachel's best friend is her sister Rebecca, who's 13 months younger, and Rebecca is almost seven and January she'll turn seven.
[time=918] And this Thanksgiving, her teacher taught the whole entire first grade class, Psalm 100, and Rebecca has memorized that
[time=926] and Rebecca wants you to say that for the friends here.
[time=930] Psalm 100, "Bake a joy for the reason 'cause of our eyelids, so the largest graders come before us presents with singing.
[time=937] The reason that the Lord, he is glad he is he that has babies and that we are so fortunate to receive Jesus thanks to him, and he too is glad to receive it.
[time=948] We thank you for watching him the best of day for the Lord, as he's ever asked.
[time=953] Rachel, if it's your generation.
[time=958] Oh, Rebecca, that was great. I don't know that I could do that. You're showing the whole family up here.
[time=964] And on my lap is our last child, and that's Adam, and I think they met him last week.
[time=970] Adam was here with me last week, weren't you?
[time=972] And Adam attends church here at Black Hawk on Wednesday night for a special program for four-year-olds called Space Cubs,
[time=978] and he has a lot of dedicated teachers also that study during the week, and they've taught him some verses, too.
[time=985] Adam, why don't you share one of your favorite verses from Space Cubs?
[time=989] We all heard kids first like this, first job for our team.
[time=993] Oh, that was a good job. Kids, thank you for not only showing that today, but for taking the time to learn God's Word.
[time=1000] In His Word, God promises us that it's our light and our life.
[time=1005] Whether we're children or adults, it's God's Word that gives direction to our very steps.
[time=1010] David said, "How shall a young man make his way clean by taking heed according to thy Word?"
[time=1017] And then David said again in Psalm 119, "Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path."
[time=1025] Without God's Word, our lives are absolutely directionless spiritually,
[time=1031] and we each desire to have a closer walk with God.
[time=1035] And I hope during this holiday season that's the desire of your heart as well.
[time=1040] We have a booklet designed to help you to have a closer walk with God, and it's entitled A Closer Walk.
[time=1048] This is a daily Bible study tool that guides you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1054] Presently, we're reading through the Gospel According to Luke. January is just about upon us,
[time=1061] and wouldn't it be a great New Year's resolution to say, "This year, I want to have a closer walk with God,
[time=1067] and I'm going to achieve it by reading His Word the entire New Testament this year." We'd love to help you do that by sending you your copy of A Closer Walk.
[time=1077] If you would like a copy, simply write to us today, and we'll send you the first copy for the month of January,
[time=1084] free as a Christmas gift from us to you.
[time=1087] Our address is the Bible Hour, Box 15,000, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1109] We do hope that you'll write today and request the booklet a closer walk so that you can begin a New Year
[time=1115] with a new adventure and a new commitment to studying God's Word.
[time=1119] Children, thank you for being good examples to me of the importance of learning God's Word.
[time=1124] And from all of us here at the Hawks family, to each of you, we hope that you have had a very Merry Christmas,
[time=1130] and you do indeed have a great and happy New Year.
[time=1154] [MUSIC - 183 seconds]
[time=1346] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1353] There's something very exciting and dynamic about brass instruments.
[time=1357] They not only play the music, but they demand an attention because they have a sense of power and majesty about them.
[time=1364] And I can't imagine that there would be anything more grand in hearing that final trumpet of God that blows and calls us all to be with him.
[time=1373] But until he blows that trumpet and the Lord Jesus comes again, it's our privilege of serving him until that day.
[time=1380] I'd like to invite you to bow with me in prayer.
[time=1383] Our God and our Father, we bow before you today, and we worship you, not only with our voices as we sing Christmas carols,
[time=1392] not only with our ears as we listen to the majestic sound of the horns, but we worship you from our heart today, God.
[time=1400] We've set this morning aside to say there's not anything more important in life than to honor you and to praise your name.
[time=1408] And oh God, we come today, feeble and frail at best, but desiring of hearts to glorify you.
[time=1417] And we come to submit ourselves to your Lordship and to declare our allegiance to you.
[time=1423] And during this holiday season, we have a double motive to thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ, that in him we have eternal life.
[time=1432] Father, we would pray for each one that's here today, or perhaps watching by way of television, that they would today see beyond the tree and the glitter,
[time=1443] see beyond the storefront displays, see beyond the wreaths that are hung in the streets, but they would see Christ.
[time=1453] They might not only see them, see him with their eyes, but they would see him with their spirits, and they might understand with their hearts.
[time=1463] They might believe that he is their Savior, and they might receive him. Father, in this very hour, we would ask you to speak in a way that no one can accept you,
[time=1476] to give confidence to believers, to encourage the hearts of discouraged Christians, and to gain the attention of those who've not yet trusted in Christ.
[time=1487] Father, we pray today that you would give comfort to those who are suffering today.
[time=1492] We pray for Jim Hutchison and Bill Suribal and Jim Pearson, as each of these men had lost their fathers in the past week.
[time=1504] We pray for the widows, their family, and this time that's meant to be a family time of a joyful reunion,
[time=1511] their eye will see an empty chair. God only you can comfort. We ask you to do that.
[time=1520] Father, we would pray today that your peace would spark some fires of healing today in damaged relationships.
[time=1530] There might come a bond of forgiveness in many homes today. In Jesus name, amen.
[time=1541] If you have your Bible with you today, I invite you to open it to Luke chapter 2.
[time=1547] But this is going to be sort of a yellow pages commercial. You know the yellow pages where you let your fingers do the walking?
[time=1554] Well today we're not going to simply stay in one passage, but ask you to move between several of the gospels, Matthew, Luke, and John.
[time=1563] So I hope you have a little flexibility and dexterity in your fingers, and you have a heart to study with us this morning.
[time=1571] We're studying a series in the life of Christ, and today we want to talk about his preparations.
[time=1578] What God did by his sovereign hand working in the life of people to prepare for the coming Messiah, preparations.
[time=1589] In life, each of us will face some events that we would call tragedies. Some will be not quite as severe, and we will call them trials.
[time=1599] There will be things that will go completely counter to our best plans. We will call those mistakes.
[time=1607] But the Scriptures teach us this truth.
[time=1611] That God works all things according to the counsel of his own plan.
[time=1619] With God there are no happenstance, they're all divine appointments.
[time=1625] The God neither falters nor fails. The Father never sleeps nor slumbers. He never nods off in his chair, and for a moment something got away from him.
[time=1637] But the very events of life are all working together according to a prepared plan that he has.
[time=1646] Today, as we study the life of Christ, I hope that you will see that God works all things according to the counsel of his own plan, and I hope that you feel that he's in control of your life today.
[time=1659] Regardless of what adversity you may face, I hope that you find the confidence that he is in control.
[time=1667] Well, Luke chapter 2. The words of the historian Luke chapter 2 verse 1.
[time=1674] In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[time=1682] This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria, and everyone went to his own town to be registered.
[time=1695] So Joseph went up from Galilee the town of Nazareth in Judea to Judea to Bethlehem the town of David because he was of the house and the line of David.
[time=1708] He went there to be registered with Mary who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
[time=1717] Here Luke the historian gives to us accurate details.
[time=1723] There are those who stand with a skeptical posture as they look at the Bible and they say well this is just folklore and legend and mythology just like the Greeks had their concepts and the Romans had their concept.
[time=1737] So this quasi Hebrew tradition has arisen. But Luke is not giving to us simply a story. He's actually giving to us history.
[time=1749] And as he gives to us history he departs from the habit of those who are simply spinning a yard by giving us some very specific details.
[time=1758] He gives us at least these three specific details. One, it was during the reign of Caesar Augustus.
[time=1767] Two, there was a governor by the name of Cyrenius or Latin Quirinius.
[time=1773] And three, there was a series of censuses that took place. This all happened during the first one.
[time=1782] By giving to us such specific detail, he's now giving to us history.
[time=1790] But what is more exciting than simply observing literary styles and saying this is history and we know it's history because of the attention to detail,
[time=1799] we are finding that secular historians who have no vested interest in the scripture are confirming the authenticity of Luke's gospel.
[time=1810] We can trust it today. From this chapter what I hope that we see is that God is first of all preparing a period of time.
[time=1822] In a moment we'll see that he has prepared a place. And finally we'll see that he has prepared a people.
[time=1829] But first of all, God has prepared a period of time. Allow me to give you a whirlwind world history tour in about two minutes.
[time=1838] Probably each one of us has heard of a man by the name of Julius Caesar.
[time=1844] And perhaps you've heard this famous line at Tu Bruté. Even you Brutus.
[time=1852] Julius Caesar was that man of military prowess who took over not only the Roman Empire but Rome itself.
[time=1862] And he centralized Rome into an empire with an emperor.
[time=1869] But on the Ides of March in 44 BC even his friends gathered around him in the cloak of loyalty but bearing the dagger of treachery.
[time=1879] And they stabbed him and his dying words were even you Brutus at Tu Bruté.
[time=1886] And with the death of Julius Caesar the empire almost disintegrates.
[time=1893] And there's no central power in control. Cleopatha, Mark Anthony, rival powers spring up.
[time=1902] But finally one individual is able to bring the empire back together. His name was Octavian.
[time=1910] And he took the title Caesar and they viewed him as an August one so they called Octavian Caesar Augustus.
[time=1919] And he brought about a revival of that Roman Empire and it began a period in history that secular historians call the Pox Romana the piece of Rome.
[time=1930] And it's during this particular period of time that Luke writes.
[time=1937] He says now it was during this period of time when Caesar Augustus reigned that there was a governor by the name of Cyrenius.
[time=1949] Now it's interesting to note the governmental structure. Rome organized in two ways.
[time=1956] First of all they would divide the Roman Empire into various sections which they would call prefectures.
[time=1962] And there would be a prefect or governor over each one. One of those was Egypt. Another one was Syria.
[time=1970] But Syria of that day was not the simple country of Syria we know today. It encompassed the land of Palestine.
[time=1977] It took in Syria, it took in Jordan, it took in Lebanon, it took in Israel.
[time=1982] And so on one arm of the government there is this governor who was appointed by the emperor to rule over the people.
[time=1992] It was his job primarily to get as much tax money out of the land as he could and at the same time maintain as much peace as he could.
[time=2002] But the Romans had a second arm of government. They would come into the land and they would take someone of that nationality and they would prop him up as a puppet king.
[time=2015] So the people would feel like well we're independent, we've got our own king and the puppet's name was Herod.
[time=2022] Now Luke gives us the historical perspective from Rome. Caesar Augustus is in power.
[time=2032] He has appointed Cyrenius governor and now a census takes place. The purpose of a census was twofold.
[time=2041] One it was for the obvious purposes of taxation. They would go into a land, they would count noses and they would find out how many people were there
[time=2051] and then they would have a per capita tax. If there are that many people in this community then they should yield forth a tax base of a certain size.
[time=2061] But they had a second purpose as well. And that was for compulsory military service. Each province was responsible to supply soldiers to work in the Roman army.
[time=2073] And then they would be taken from one part of the empire and they would be shipped into another part where they had no loyalty other than Rome.
[time=2082] Now Luke gives us this as history. He's teaching it as though it were authentic. Caesar Augustus, Cyrenius, a census.
[time=2094] For centuries we have all confirmed that there was a Caesar Augustus. Whether there was a Cyrenius that had also been established.
[time=2106] But there was a question that was raised because the chronology does not work out. The chronology in the timetable does not work because when Cyrenius was governor that was 9 B.C.
[time=2121] Our best records don't show the birth of Jesus to about 4 B.C. Till we discover a man by the name of Tacitus.
[time=2131] Tacitus is a Latin historian. He is not a Christian, he is not a Hebrew, he has no axe to grind. He is writing annals of Roman history and so they're called the annals of Roman history.
[time=2144] And Tacitus enlightens the world. That on two occasions Cyrenius was governor over Sirius.
[time=2156] It was called back to Rome and then placed a second time. Luke's history was right. Cyrenius was governor.
[time=2167] Then the critic said yes but this concept of taxation we know about every 14 years they did that but a taxation where everybody had to migrate back to their home city that wouldn't work.
[time=2181] That's a constructive Luke to make the whole thing fit together. You've got to have Joseph and Nazareth and you've got to get him to Bethlehem so you blame it on Caesar.
[time=2192] Archaeology to the rescue. Archaeologists have discovered this document in Egypt contemporary to the time of Quirenius in Syria.
[time=2205] Here's what the document says. Gaius Phoebeus Maximus, good name for a son. You might want to use that next time you have a child.
[time=2213] Gaius Phoebeus Maximus. Get over here. Prefective Egypt orders.
[time=2221] Seeing that the time has come for house to house census it is necessary to compel all those who for any cause whatsoever residing outside their districts to return to their own houses that they may both carry out the regular order of the census
[time=2239] and they also diligently attend to the cultivation of their allotments.
[time=2244] You know what that's saying? It's saying the Luke was right again.
[time=2248] That the Romans insisted that every man go back to the place of his father's birth so that they could figure out who's who and have an accurate census.
[time=2259] They didn't want anybody going into a different city and always avoiding the draft.
[time=2265] So they said you got to register for the draft in the taxes at the local post office.
[time=2272] What's the bottom line of all this? Two things.
[time=2276] First of all, the sea that God's hand was at work in history and he was preparing a period of time.
[time=2286] From the secular historians we have nothing more than the battle of Actium where the powers of Anthony and Cleopatra take on the powers of Octavian.
[time=2294] The powers of Octavian and Octavian wins.
[time=2298] But from God's perspective he rose up an Octavian that he might control history.
[time=2307] Psalm says the promotion does not come from the east or from the west but it is God who raises up one and who brings down another.
[time=2315] Proverbs says the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord.
[time=2322] He is sovereign. He is in control of history and he was preparing this period of time.
[time=2330] He was working all things according to the counsel of his own will.
[time=2335] And from that should spring this application that he's in control of my times today.
[time=2342] You know that I'm a time frustrated person.
[time=2345] I am so time oriented. I don't know what your family was like. Kathy's family and my family were completely opposites.
[time=2353] My family structure is this way. My father says what time do you want to leave for church on Sunday morning?
[time=2358] If you say nine o'clock at eight fifty nine the car will be warmed up. He will be in it.
[time=2365] If need be he'll have it back into the driveway for a quicker getaway and he'll be there waiting for everybody else to get in the car at eight fifty nine.
[time=2374] Kathy's family nine o'clock means sometime that day probably before noon but not for sure.
[time=2383] I am a very time conscious person. I inherited that either biologically or by learned behavior being forced upon me.
[time=2397] And you know I get frustrated with time. Do I have enough time to accomplish all that I feel are priorities?
[time=2404] Do I have enough time to get everything done that people have asked to be done within a certain time?
[time=2410] You know what great confidence there comes to my life and the moments of those frustrations say there's a God who controls times.
[time=2418] And he's the one that can arrange every circumstance according to the counsel of his own will.
[time=2424] I don't know how many times I've said it from this pulpit, God's in control of your time.
[time=2428] I don't know how many times I said it to you individually. We can trust God he's in control.
[time=2433] But yet when I get into that time bind I get irritable.
[time=2437] Oh that's a kind term, irritable.
[time=2441] I get you know I'm about as pleasant to be around as a porcupine.
[time=2446] But you know there's a God who says I'm in control of time.
[time=2451] I can prepare a period of history and I can prepare your day. Trust me with your time.
[time=2459] First lesson that we get in the preparations of Christ is God prepared a period of time.
[time=2467] The second preparation is God prepared a place.
[time=2473] As we read on here in Luke chapter 2 it's parallel in Matthew chapter 2. It says that he went to register with Mary who was pledged to be his wife.
[time=2484] She was expecting child. While they were there the time came for the baby to be born and she gave birth to her firstborn.
[time=2493] And she wrapped him in clothes and claws and placed him in a manger.
[time=2497] This migration took place from Nazareth in the northern province of Galilee to Bethlehem in the southern province of Judea because that was God's prepared place.
[time=2512] She's in Nazareth but Messiah the prepared place is Bethlehem and so God arranged a period of time with a census that forced them to go to the prepared place which was Bethlehem.
[time=2526] What was prepared about Bethlehem? Well there wasn't anything about Bethlehem. They didn't have a better hospital.
[time=2532] They didn't have a better maternity section. A barn is pretty much a barn.
[time=2537] But what was prepared about Bethlehem was it was the city of David first of all and Messiah was to be born of the house in the lineage of David.
[time=2547] Secondly, Michael the prophet said prophetically 500 years in advance Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.
[time=2556] Though you Bethlehem afraid to, though you be the least of the cities of Judea out of you shall come forth.
[time=2565] One whose goings and comings are from the ancient of days.
[time=2569] Messiah would come from a prepared place which is Bethlehem. In Matthew chapter 2 we find the visitation of the Magi. Gentile, nobility, they're coming, bearing gifts and they don't know prophecy.
[time=2585] So they come to the court of Herod and they say where is he that is born king of the Jews.
[time=2592] Herod is really not an Israelite either. He's an Idumian, not an idiot an Idumian. He's an idiot too but by ancestor he's an Idumian.
[time=2601] He doesn't know so he calls and the wise men of Israel come in and they know prophecy.
[time=2607] He instantly they say, well he's to be born in Bethlehem. Israelites knew that Messiah would come to a prepared place and there was an expectation.
[time=2621] And Israel was in those days looking for Messiah. False Messiahs like Simon Markopo had sprung up and said I am he but he was a liar.
[time=2632] But there was expectation and God had prepared Israel as a prepared place for Messiah to come that they would know the city, they would know the tribe, they would know the ancestry, they would have expectation it was a prepared place.
[time=2649] Thirdly, God not only prepared a period and a place but most significantly he prepared people. Allow me to identify the four key individuals that God prepared.
[time=2663] One quite obvious is found in Matthew chapter 1 verse 18. This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph but before they came together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
[time=2689] Because Joseph or husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
[time=2700] The first individual that God prepared was Joseph, a just man. Allow me to explain the process of marriage and engagement in those days.
[time=2711] It wasn't like today where boy meets girl, girl sees boy and goes yuck. Few weeks later he gets up the courage and asks her out for a date and she changes her mind and they get engaged and married.
[time=2723] Totally initiative on their part. In those days it went something more like this. A man such as myself may have a daughter.
[time=2733] My daughter Rachel is eight years old and I may see a son of a friend of mine and say he looks like a pretty good lot there.
[time=2742] And so I would go to my friend and I would say I have my daughter Rachel you have your son John.
[time=2748] How about if I give you and betrothal my daughter Rachel to be married to your son John when he's 18 and you pay me to head of camel and head of oxen.
[time=2763] And he says sounds like a good deal and the betrothal is set right then.
[time=2768] Now these two may grow up seeing each other or they may never see each other but the betrothal is in place.
[time=2775] They'll come an event an actual ceremony but it is not the wedding but they'll come a time of formal we would call it engagement but they actually considered it marriage where the school were publicly in a ceremony pledged together.
[time=2790] But they were not married they would not live together yet it was a time of testing and a purity.
[time=2797] Then there would come a second ceremony where they would actually be brought together as husband and wife.
[time=2804] Joseph and Mary have been betrothed the transaction is taking place they've had that first ceremony but they are not yet completely married they have not yet come together as husband and wife.
[time=2817] They are in this intermediate period in many ways it was a period to prove purity.
[time=2824] Now try to feel the emotion of this drama.
[time=2830] Here's a young man for his life he has been engaged to a young woman there's been anticipation.
[time=2838] There may have been occasional meetings and development of relationships.
[time=2843] It might have been an exchange of those glances of eyes that lovers have that communicate more sometimes than even the words.
[time=2851] There may have been an even occasional touching of the hand and expression of gentleness more than anything else there was anticipation.
[time=2861] Here's a young man for all of his life he's been pledged and he's been pure.
[time=2869] And it's almost the time for the marriage to be consummated he discovers the one who has been pledged to him is not pure.
[time=2882] But this is far more than the hurt of the young man who listens to his engaged girlfriend explain that years before they met she had compromised her purity and could he forgive today.
[time=2895] This is far more than the young lady who loves a man and wants to marry him and he says before you say yes I need to tell you years ago this is not years ago this is today we are engaged today and she is pregnant now.
[time=2913] And I am sure that he was a just man.
[time=2925] In that sense of justice it's not speaking of absolute moral perfection Joseph like you like me he too was a sinner but he was just in that he wanted to do the right thing.
[time=2940] And he had two options option number one is he could make a spectacle of Mary.
[time=2947] He could become vindictive and the law would stand by his side he could expose her and declare his innocence there would be a trial and she would probably be found guilty.
[time=2959] She would be stoned to death or he could simply go and in quiet get a bill of divorce that was necessary even for a betrobo they were not married.
[time=2972] Being a just man he decided on the latter.
[time=2977] It was at that moment that God sent an angel of the Lord to tell him Joseph.
[time=2983] Joseph don't be afraid to take Mary to be your wife and he explains the miraculous conception and the virgin birth but God prepared a unique man in history.
[time=2999] What kind of man would be able to say I will live with some people looking at me and saying oh Joseph you couldn't wait we saw Mary little had a schedule aren't we Joseph.
[time=3013] He would be willing to take that public shame if some would look at him and accuse him of impurity.
[time=3021] There would be others who would say Joseph your girlfriend Mary's been around hasn't she.
[time=3032] What a man of courage to say I'll not be afraid either have my character falsely impugned the character of the one that I love I will take her.
[time=3044] Oh that's a just man. A man prepared of heart by God.
[time=3051] There was a second man that Matthew tells us about who was also prepared.
[time=3056] Unlike Joseph he was not a just man he was a disturbed man he is found in the next chapter chapter two.
[time=3063] Chapter two verse one and after Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod Magi came from the east to Jerusalem and asked where is the one who has been born king of the Jews.
[time=3076] We saw his star in the east and we've come to worship him.
[time=3080] When Herod heard this he was disturbed.
[time=3085] What do you mean where is he born king of the Jews I am king of the Jews would be Herod's declaration he was disturbed.
[time=3095] He was angry he was vehement.
[time=3100] He was not only a disturbed man we discover in the next verses he was a deceitful man he said to them when you find him I come back and tell me where he is that I could go and worship him too.
[time=3112] Herod had no intention of worshiping him he had only intentions of exterminating him.
[time=3119] Only was he a deceitful disturbed man he was a destructive man.
[time=3124] When the Magi did not report back he had all the children slaughtered.
[time=3131] But God had prepared this disturbed man and was using him as much as he was using the just man Joseph.
[time=3139] Tell me it also prepared.
[time=3142] You see there's a lesson here for us that God has the ability to take evil.
[time=3149] And as the master chestman manipulate the workers of evil into his own plan and use them for good.
[time=3158] Let me give you some examples.
[time=3160] Herod Joseph of the Old Testament that little squirrely guy who was always one upping his older brothers and they had had it and they sold him into slavery.
[time=3171] And for years he was a slave and for years he was in prison and then he becomes a leader.
[time=3179] Not only a leader but prime minister.
[time=3182] Years have gone by and his brothers are now standing before him pleading for grain and for their lives and they don't know that it's Joseph.
[time=3189] And then Joseph reveals himself to them and they are certain this is it.
[time=3194] Joseph will pour out his wrath and he'll kill us all now.
[time=3199] And Joseph gave this insightful response what you intended for evil God has used for good.
[time=3209] Here were evil brothers but God turned their evil plot into good.
[time=3215] Here was a mad Herod and God simply used him as a pawn in his chest game and used him for good to fulfill the prophecies of the flight to Egypt and the weeping in Ramon.
[time=3233] There is a third person that God prepared found in Luke's gospel.
[time=3239] Luke chapter one tells us of Mary.
[time=3244] Mary is the focal point of Luke's gospel where Joseph more the focal point of Matthew's gospel.
[time=3252] In Luke one twenty six we read this in the six month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth to a town in Galilee to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph a descendant of David.
[time=3265] The virgin's name was Mary. The angel went to her and said greetings you who are highly favored the Lord is with you.
[time=3275] Joseph a just man Herod a disturbed man and now Mary a favored woman all were prepared by God.
[time=3288] The Bible tells us two things about Mary first of all she was a virgin she was pure.
[time=3295] Secondly it says that she was a favored woman the word favored is the word Corinne from which we get grace.
[time=3302] It is saying Mary you're a woman given grace don't ever confuse the miraculous birth of Jesus with an immaculate conception.
[time=3313] The immaculate conception is a reference to that Mary was immaculate that she was without sin she was not without sin she was a human being sinful just as you and just as me.
[time=3326] She needed a Savior she declares that in her own magnificent here it says that she was chosen not because she merited it but out of grace undeserved favor God has chosen her.
[time=3340] She is a woman was uniquely prepared she was pure and she was the recipient of grace she too like Joseph had to be a woman of substance and character.
[time=3353] She's probably in early teens let's arbitrarily say maybe somewhere around 14 men would you believe it if your daughter came home and said dad I've got some good news and some bad news.
[time=3366] Bad news is dad I'm pregnant but the good news is before you get upset an angel told me it's okay so don't sweat it dad how that go over with you dad took an enormous woman of courage.
[time=3382] They say here my Lord use me I will be misunderstood I am willing to be falsely accused I am willing to have indicting fingers of people who love to gossip I'd love to have my name on the lips of everyone who's promoting evil.
[time=3403] God had a prepared woman when he would say yes I'll be available to God.
[time=3411] Fourth person God prepared is the focal point of John's gospel it is John not the writer of John's gospel but John the Baptist we meet him in chapter one where it says there came a man verse six who was sent from God his name John.
[time=3429] Let me share with you very quickly five good insights of Charles Swindall about this prepared man John the Baptist Swindall said he was human but not ordinary.
[time=3442] That he was a lamp but not the light that he was a voice crying in the wilderness but not the word he was useful but not indispensable he was a witness but not an object of worship.
[time=3462] God prepared all of the players the stage is set for the entrance of Messiah into the world.
[time=3474] God prepared period of time he prepared place and then he prepared people he was working all things according to the counsel of his own well and he shares all this in his word that we might trust him with our life and with our times.
[time=3494] Would you trust him now as your Savior?
