[time=113] These two brothers had a new business of hauling Christmas trees from up north in Michigan down south to Tennessee.
[time=119] They got the trees for $5 a piece up in Michigan, drive the truck up, pick up the trees, drive them back down to Tennessee,
[time=126] and there they had a little lot, and they were selling the trees for $5 a piece.
[time=131] After a couple of weeks the brothers got the talking, they weren't making any money, instead they were losing money.
[time=136] One of the brothers said, "You know what I think the problem is? I think we need a bigger truck." (music)
[time=151] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=156] Thank you for joining us.
[time=158] Rick's message today is entitled, "A Son, a Savior is Authenticity." Too often in life we fail to evaluate our methods and approach.
[time=168] We double our efforts and press ahead, never realizing it is our direction, not our determination that is an error.
[time=176] Today as we study the life of Christ, the Lord shows the only method of overcoming temptation in life.
[time=182] What could be more important or practical, since temptation is something we will all face.
[time=188] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=192] Our text today is Matthew chapter 4 verses 1 through 11.
[time=197] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us from the living Christmas tree.
[time=202] Other music includes a package from Keith and Starr Bradigo.
[time=207] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=214] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=217] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=221] Now here's Rick.
[time=225] It's a joy to welcome each of you this Sunday morning.
[time=229] This is our last Sunday that we get to worship together with the staging and the set of the living Christmas tree.
[time=235] That's always an exciting time in the life of our church.
[time=238] As this symbolizes our church's effort to share with the greater community the fact that we believe that Jesus Christ is alive
[time=246] and He is worthy of our worship and our praise.
[time=249] Thank you for coming this morning that we can praise Him together.
[time=252] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=257] We hope that this hour together strengthens your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and fulfills our God-given need to worship and to praise Him.
[time=266] As you've celebrated Christmas together as a family we hope that you sense more than anything else.
[time=272] That Jesus is the heartbeat of Christmas and He's the heartbeat of heaven.
[time=277] Our choir is going to sing along with Lisa. Two songs that we trust will draw your attention not only to Christmas but to Jesus Christ, the heartbeat of it all.
[time=307] Every December I put up the tree wrapped up the presents and laid them beneath and gave no thought to the things I believed.
[time=336] I never let you in.
[time=344] But this year I know that it's not like before.
[time=352] Your love has come through my heart's open door. What can I do now but praise and adore the one who dwells with me?
[time=375] For you are the heartbeat of heaven.
[time=384] The joy and the promise of life if you are the heartbeat of heaven.
[time=400] Set to my life from above.
[time=408] And I can't explain how I could contain such a wonder and the mystery.
[time=423] For God's hand the heartbeat of heaven, to bring the heart of me.
[time=445] Love feels impossible, everything is new. Prayers being answered and dreams coming true now that I've filled with the wonder of you.
[time=469] And all the hope you bring.
[time=477] For you are the heartbeat of heaven.
[time=486] The joy and the promise of life if you are the heartbeat of heaven.
[time=502] Set to my life from above. And I can't explain how I could contain such a wonder and the mystery.
[time=529] For you are the heartbeat of heaven, to bring the heart of me.
[time=551] In the heartbeat of heaven.
[time=581] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=587] Sing to the Lord, give him the glory.
[time=593] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=600] Forevermore, let his love fill the air and let there be praise.
[time=609] He has come to the earth as a baby, has anointed one.
[time=615] As a gift to the heart that is waiting, a singer and a son.
[time=622] So lift your voices with legacy, proclaim through all fear that Jesus Christ is King.
[time=635] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=641] Sing to the Lord, give him the glory.
[time=646] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=654] Forevermore, let his love fill the air and let there be praise.
[time=663] He has a surprise of his people, and he was in within.
[time=670] The peace that he gives of his people is mercy goes away.
[time=677] So lift your voices with legacy, proclaim through all the earth that Jesus Christ is King.
[time=689] Let there be praise, let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=696] Forevermore, let his love fill the air and let there be praise.
[time=709] Let there be praise.
[time=719] We've been saying for many weeks now and believing it that Christmas is the season of the heart and Jesus is the heart of it all.
[time=727] It's with mixed emotions that we tear down the tree tomorrow and put it away for another year because we've had a wonderful season
[time=733] praising the Lord through the ministry of the Living Christmas Tree and the music for this year.
[time=738] Let's go back to that little town in Bethlehem and recall the birth of our savers we sing together.
[time=743] Found on 117. 117 will sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=773] Thus do we sing thee high, of all thy great and free west sweet, the silent stars of mine.
[time=788] Let in thy country try them, the perilousing light of hopes and fears of all the youth.
[time=802] Our letting be through the heart.
[time=809] What Christ is for our wealthy, thy gather of love.
[time=819] Our mortals sing the angels, their wants for our reward.
[time=829] All glory starts to bear, offering a holy word.
[time=839] And praises me through gospel of me, and it's through men on earth.
[time=851] Oh, holy is God of heaven, descend to us we pray.
[time=861] As far as our sin and land for me, be born in us to bear.
[time=871] We hear the Christmas angels, offering a mighty spell.
[time=881] Welcome to us, our limitless, our glory and everywhere.
[time=895] At Christmas we celebrate the birth of Christ and that God sent him into the world.
[time=904] And just as God sent him into the world, as believers in Christ, we are now called the same.
[time=910] Ones to be sent into the world to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=915] God has from this church sent out a number of people.
[time=918] One of those was a young lady who was a part of our college ministry years ago when she was Marcia Jones.
[time=925] She moved from here to Biola College and became Marcia Filchner.
[time=929] And she and her husband, Dennis, have been serving the Lord together in Peru.
[time=933] And they're back home after two years on the field and with us today.
[time=937] And I would like to invite them to join me and introduce them to you.
[time=941] These are the Filchner's, Marcia and Dennis, and we're delighted to have you back home in Fort Wayne.
[time=946] Dennis, welcome.
[time=947] It's a privilege to have such quality people like this representing the Lord in our church literally around the world.
[time=954] When you left us, Marcia, you left with a small family and your family changed quite a bit in the two years.
[time=961] Yes, when we saw you all last two years ago at Thanksgiving, we left here with one 18-month-old son and we're expecting our second child.
[time=970] And we now came back home with three children.
[time=974] We have one Peruvian with us who was born and made down at our center in Peru.
[time=979] So life has changed quite a bit since we left you and yet God has been good and blessed us abundantly in those changes.
[time=985] Well, we're sure happy for you having two children in South America to us as United States loyalists.
[time=992] That's courage.
[time=993] You'll go down to John Kennedy's book, Profiles and Courage.
[time=997] Dennis, you bring in expertise in computers and when we think of the mission field of Peru, we think of people climbing up into the highlands of the Andes Mountains
[time=1006] and we don't picture computers.
[time=1008] How did that work out?
[time=1010] Well, now when they go in to do a translation, they also bring a computer with them.
[time=1016] They have lots of computers that can be able to use solar power so that when they are out in their grass huts,
[time=1024] they just stick the solar panel on top of the roof and they're able to go ahead and use the computer there.
[time=1030] My job is on the center and that is being able to help them when they come back to the center in printing out the different text that they have
[time=1038] and in helping them to analyze the text that they have.
[time=1042] So that's what I do on the center.
[time=1044] Marcia, when you were here, I remember you as a nursing student about how did all the jobs fit together as a nurse and mother and wife and missionary?
[time=1053] Well, when I left here, I did expect to go to the mission field as a missionary nurse.
[time=1059] However, the Lord is much wiser than we are.
[time=1062] When you go to a place, no matter where it is in the world, whether it's here in Fort Wayne or across the plains of the Andes,
[time=1071] the same ministry needs are found anywhere that are found here in the church.
[time=1076] So God showed me that even there in Peru, there were as many needs that I can minister in as here.
[time=1083] We had the same needs for encouragement, for being family to those who do not have family, to opening my home till singles and we were quite involved in a singles ministry while we were there.
[time=1095] And our children also afforded us another ministry with young couples who had children as well, making the adjustments to the jungle and also to new families as they arrived in Peru.
[time=1107] There's quite an adjustment, a little bit different culture than what we experienced here, and since God gave us some insight into how to cope with some of those things,
[time=1115] he allowed me some opportunity to open my home to some women as they came to show them some of the domestic skills that they might need and culturally with the same situation.
[time=1124] So it was quite an exciting ministry, even though nursing was not really a part of it in this past few years.
[time=1130] I'm sure that was exciting with three kids, three and under. Dennis, you've invested two years in South America on the mission field.
[time=1138] What do you bring out of that experience that you can share with us by way of challenge?
[time=1143] Well, I really would like to challenge you that there is any one of you can be used on the mission field.
[time=1150] There are skills that are needed as the linguists do their work. It's not a work that I necessarily even have to understand completely, but we can be helpful to them by building houses,
[time=1165] by helping them, in my case, with the computer needs, with just being an encouragement. There are a lot of things to do.
[time=1175] I think that as we join in the task of Bible translation worldwide, one of the things we want to remember is that the fields are really white and they're ready for harvest.
[time=1187] And we need to pray those laborers into the harvest, and maybe some of you could be some of them. Maybe you're waiting for the Lord to prick at your heart in order to tell you about a time to go, and maybe that time is coming up soon.
[time=1204] Dennis, that's a good challenge. I remember hearing it said that our greatest ability is our availability. Thanks for making yourselves available to God.
[time=1214] We have a New Testament that was dedicated while we were in Peru. This is the Takuna New Testament that we would like to give to you.
[time=1224] Thank you.
[time=1225] It is one of three New Testaments that was dedicated when we were there in Peru. That means that it was given, actually given out to the people there, and they had a big dedication service.
[time=1238] We want to thank you for your part in this particular translation and for many more to come.
[time=1244] I know at the Christmas season we talk about Emmanuel being God with us, and just the joy it is for people to be able to have God's Word in their own language, God Jesus actually came to them this year for the first time in written form.
[time=1263] That's part of your part that you have had by praying and by sharing with us.
[time=1268] Thank you so much. We'll put this on display in our lobby as a reminder of not only your ministry, but our responsibility to get God's Word out. Let us pray together.
[time=1278] God, thank you for Dennis and Marsha and their availability to you and their sensitivity. God, we ask you to direct them and bless them in the next chapter of their life and pray that you would use their model here and in other places to challenge each of us to make ourselves available to you in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1299] Thank you, folk nurse. Now we have the privilege of hearing from Keith and Starr as they minister to us in music.
[time=1329] [MUSIC - 134 seconds]
[time=1470] Thank you for joining us again today, here on The Bible Hour.
[time=1477] This is the last Sunday for one year that we'll be able to share with you the living Christmas tree.
[time=1482] We certainly hope you've enjoyed The Choir and Keith and Star's Ministry of Music this morning.
[time=1486] It's a privilege to introduce to you the Kobe family.
[time=1488] Of course you know Pete, but we have the privilege of his whole family joining us here this morning.
[time=1493] Rick, it's a delight to be here today and it's been a special privilege to have our family home from the East Coast and the West Coast.
[time=1499] It's been a great Christmas time and part of it was the fact that you all, many of you, were here at the Living Christmas Tree performances.
[time=1506] We got to say hello to you and that was a special time for all of us.
[time=1509] We're glad that you, those of you that came, had the opportunity and I hope it made your Christmas a little more bright.
[time=1515] I'd like to introduce to you now my wife Carol.
[time=1518] She was very active in our ministries during the Christmas season and we really appreciate that.
[time=1523] Christmas has been a real special time for me this year.
[time=1526] Two things have happened.
[time=1528] One, the Living Christmas Tree and I had the privilege of singing in all of the concerts and that's always a real blessing to me.
[time=1534] Then the other special thing that has happened is all my children are home for Christmas and to a mother that's always very special.
[time=1540] We're sorry that Andy can't be with us today.
[time=1543] He is our 12 year old.
[time=1545] He's in the seventh grade here at Black Art Christian School and he's home with the sore throat today.
[time=1550] Peter, we're glad you're home from college.
[time=1552] Tell us a little bit where you're studying or where you're putting in your time these days.
[time=1557] Well, I'm a freshman at Liberty University and I'm studying business and I'm having a lot of fun there with activities and I really enjoy the school.
[time=1565] Well, that's good.
[time=1566] Many of our people, I'm sure, are familiar with Liberty University.
[time=1569] Along with studying, you're having a good time.
[time=1571] What extra curricular activities have you been involved in?
[time=1574] I was involved in soccer, intramural soccer and we had a lot of fun with that.
[time=1578] I remember your days here at Black Art Christian, you were quite a soccer player.
[time=1582] And Lisa Coby is no longer Lisa Coby.
[time=1585] Your name has changed but not the Lisa part of it.
[time=1588] Yes, my name is Lisa Qualls and my husband Scott and I live in Salem, Oregon and it's a real special privilege for us to come home this Christmas.
[time=1596] Well, we're sure glad to have you home.
[time=1598] Scott, welcome to Fort Wayne.
[time=1600] I understand we're going to get to see a lot more of you.
[time=1603] That's right, Rick.
[time=1604] Lisa and I are excited.
[time=1606] This spring we're moving to Fort Wayne in March and I'll start Grace Seminary in the fall.
[time=1611] I'll be glad to send you some notes that are only 12 years old if you'd like to see me after this summer.
[time=1616] Well, I think any help will be greatly received.
[time=1618] I know you'll do just great.
[time=1620] We're looking forward to you all moving back here and thanks so much for coming in early this morning and sharing Christmas and New Years with our television friends.
[time=1628] Before we go back to our morning worship service, I do want to encourage you this Sunday to write and request a very helpful booklet entitled "A Closer Walk." It's designed to help us do exactly what it says to have a closer walk with our Heavenly Father
[time=1644] by studying the Scriptures.
[time=1646] In the message today, we'll discover that Jesus faced temptation successfully because he knew God's Word.
[time=1653] In the three temptations of Christ, three times he responded by saying, "It is written."
[time=1660] The power of God's Word is the power for the Christian life and you and I will have power and direct proportion to the time and the quality of investment we put into God's Word.
[time=1671] If you'll write to us today, we'll send you a closer walk so that you can have a daily quiet time that will take you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=1679] If you'll write to us today, we'll send you a copy so that you can begin this New Year with a New Year's commitment to studying God's Word.
[time=1687] You can receive a closer walk by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1700] Please note that the address is new just a little bit different and we're going to give it to you again.
[time=1705] Right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1715] Thank you, Pete, and thank all of you for joining us this morning.
[time=1719] If we go back to our morning worship service, we trust that God will strengthen your heart and your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1735] [MUSIC]
