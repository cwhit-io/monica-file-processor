[time=90] (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (silence)
[time=111] (silence) (silence) When the heat is on, each of us take on a personality like Dickens, the artful dodger.
[time=125] The woman at the well was no exception.
[time=128] When Jesus began to probe into her life, she wanted to dodge the spiritual issues.
[time=134] Perhaps you've done the same or heard the same.
[time=137] When out of the blue, we ask questions like, "Well, what happens to the people who live on the Amazon who never heard about Jesus Christ?
[time=145] Or what about the people who don't have a copy of the Bible?
[time=147] Or how many angels can dance on the head of the pin at one time?" Well, the answer is quite easy.
[time=155] Angels don't dance, and we can't dodge from God's probing into our hearts.
[time=162] [MUSIC]
[time=172] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=175] Thank you for joining us.
[time=177] Rick's message today is entitled, "The Woman at the Well." Most of us can remember that one teacher that we could easily derail from the lecture of the day by asking unrelated questions.
[time=189] You could get him on a side track, and perhaps with a little luck, not make it back to the subject at hand before the bell rang and in the period.
[time=198] On a rare occasion, a test might even be put off.
[time=201] Often we try to dodge the spiritual issues of life, like the woman at the well.
[time=207] While we may allude the preacher or sports person, God is not so easily shaken from the trail.
[time=213] He sees right through our dodging questions.
[time=216] We have an unavoidable appointment with God.
[time=219] Today studying the life of Christ is great preparation for that occasion.
[time=225] [MUSIC]
[time=228] We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study along with us.
[time=232] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=236] Other special music includes a solo from Kathy Hawks, a song from Rejoice, and Dennis Kirschner.
[time=247] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=255] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=260] Now, here's Rick.
[time=262] Today, welcoming you to a house of worship that we might praise God and to say that He is a solid rock on which we can stand.
[time=272] We're delighted that you've come that we can lift our voices together, also thankful for the privilege of sharing this service by way of television with our friends who join us now for the Bible Hour.
[time=283] This morning, as our choir sings, it's our attempt to shout out a word of praise in a beautiful musical way to say our God is worthy of worship, that the worth of God is the one who deserves all praise.
[time=299] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=417] Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him.
[time=429] Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the king of creation.
[time=453] In hymn number 82, we'll sing together verses 1, 3, and 4 of hymn number 82.
[time=475] Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the king of creation.
[time=485] Oh, my soul, praise Him, for He is my element of creation.
[time=494] Glory to Him, now to the best temple for Him, to meet in the revelation.
[time=510] Praise to the Lord, with the world's skills of His name. If He will help, if He will come in Him, guide Him and save me.
[time=529] How of the great after we brought Him with Him, spreading His wings forth to shame me.
[time=545] Praise to the Lord, with all their dreams in me, a door in the bed of life and birth of love, with praises before Him.
[time=564] Thank you for your very good singing, we appreciate that in our first service.
[time=587] We enjoy not only the singing of choir and congregation, but our special music.
[time=591] I'm sure in this hour, the music will be a blessing to you.
[time=594] Let's listen now to Kathy Hawks as she ministers to us in song.
[time=621] God will provide a way. I know He'll provide a way, 'cause His word is true and He will do it for you.
[time=642] God will provide a way. When your world's upside down, and it crumbles and falls, and it's so hard to make it through another day.
[time=659] And you've got mountains to move, and this seems so tough, but you're not giving up, because His promises say, God will provide a way.
[time=678] I know He'll provide a way, 'cause His word is true and He will do it for you. I know God will provide a way.
[time=696] But now it may be at the very last moment, when your faith is all that's pulling you through, and it may be in the most unexpected way.
[time=713] But He'll provide an answer just for you, and for you just for you. So turn your back on your problems, and your face to the Lord, and let them come and lift your burdens away.
[time=734] And as you pass to the night, and your faith turns to sight, you'll have been there before, so you'll know just what to say.
[time=749] God will provide a way. I know He'll provide a way.
[time=763] Yes, His word, it's true and He will do it for you. I know God will provide. Yes, God will provide. I know He'll provide a way.
[time=791] Provide a way.
[time=804] [APPLAUSE]
[time=810] Thank you, Kathy. I'd like to encourage each of our visitors with us today to refer to the inside of your bulletin.
[time=817] In a moment we will stand and recite the memory verse that we as a congregation have been working on.
[time=822] You'll find that verse in the upper right hand corner of your bulletin. For those of us who are regular, I would like to also encourage you to take that same bulletin and tuck it in your Bible.
[time=833] So we can be real fair about this. Let's stand, please, and recite a verse.
[time=841] 1 Corinthians 16-2. On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with His income, saving it up so that when I come, no collection will have to be made. 1 Corinthians 16-2. Thank you.
[time=866] Thank you for joining us again today here for the Bible Hour. We've been laughing and chuckling, which hasn't been all that kind because we've been doing it at Pete's expense.
[time=875] This past week, Pete injured himself and broke his right wrist. Exactly. How did you break your wrist?
[time=882] Well, actually, I didn't think it was broken, but I happened to hit a patch of ice while I was riding my bike on Monday morning.
[time=887] When I was directing the choir on Wednesday evening, some of the nurses noticed that I wasn't functioning properly, so by Thursday, I thought I'd have it checked out, and sure enough, it was broken.
[time=896] I don't feel very kind laughing at a man who broke his wrist, but there aren't that many guys.
[time=901] Your age, your mind, who have fallen off their bike recently. Well, for 35 or 40 years old, that's not true to that.
[time=907] Excuse me. Could you come again with those numbers? Maybe more like 45. Oh, well, somewhere in that neighborhood.
[time=913] Well, we certainly enjoy working together and sharing the Lord Jesus Christ because He's given us so much joy, and we occasionally tease each other, but just knowing Christ and the abundant life He gives is a great joy.
[time=927] Perhaps recently, you've come to know Christ as your Savior. Perhaps God's even used this broadcast in your life.
[time=934] We'd certainly like to hear from you to know how God has used this ministry in your life and in your home.
[time=940] And if you would take the time today, just to drop us a note, that would be a big help to us in our ministry.
[time=946] So please write today. Pete, would you give them, at this time, the address, and then I'll share some more information?
[time=951] Yes, Rick. We're really encouraged when you write to us. So do that today, right to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=963] That's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=971] As you write, we would like to ask you to request this booklet entitled "What the Bible Says About Jesus Christ."
[time=979] This booklet has been penned by David Hawking, a great teacher of God's Word. He's presently ministering in Southern California, but he has a great influence through his publications across the nation.
[time=992] This booklet is so important because this is the fundamental of the Christian faith, what we believe about Jesus Christ.
[time=1001] And many of us have grown up going to church and have a pretty good idea of what the Bible says, but I am amazed daily to discover that people really don't know who Christ is.
[time=1012] As a matter of fact, this past week, I was visiting a family, and as we talked, the lady with joyful tears near I said, "I've gone to church all my life, but I never knew that Jesus Christ forgave me of my sins if I would just receive him as my Lord."
[time=1029] Well this booklet will give you some solid biblical teaching on what Jesus said about himself, the names and the attributes that Jesus possessed that equated him with God, and the outstanding proof of his resurrection.
[time=1043] We'd love to send you a copy if you'll simply write to us. We'll mail it to you free, and we want you to have it today. So please do write.
[time=1051] Rick David Hocking is an outstanding Bible teacher, and you'll be encouraged as you write for this booklet. Once again, I want to give you the address. It's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1068] Well thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour this week. During the week I have the privilege of going on a missions trip to Jamaica.
[time=1075] It's always a little suspicious when it's cold and you're headed to the Caribbean, but it is a missions trip. We're going down a group of us to set up an expedition this summer to take 30 people down to do medical missions and a variety of evangelistic projects.
[time=1091] But we'll be back next week and looking forward to sharing with you again on the Bible Hour. We hope you'll stay with us and open up both your heart and your Bible so that we can study God's Word together this morning.
[time=1105] [MUSIC]
[time=1135] Brothers, why's He strong and I'm no cause for worry or for fear.
[time=1148] He whose heart is going beyond the measure gives unto each day what he deserves.
[time=1162] [MUSIC]
[time=1179] Help me then in every tribulation so to trust I promise as O Lord that I lose not face sweet consolation.
[time=1202] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=1276] Our God and our Father, we come to you with grateful hearts today hearing the assurance of the promise that day by day and with each passing hour that we can depend upon you.
[time=1291] We thank you today for your faithfulness and for your steadfastness and for your dependability.
[time=1299] God, we thank you for the promise that in the adversities of life that you will provide away.
[time=1307] And we come today to worship you and to praise you and particularly to thank you for your covenant faithfulness.
[time=1315] God, many of us today know the pain of rejection. Someone has said to us that they would be a friend.
[time=1323] Someone has said that they would be our partner in life and they broken that promise.
[time=1329] But you O God are dependable.
[time=1331] You alone are trustworthy amongst all who dwell on the earth and we praise you today.
[time=1337] And we exalt and lift up and magnify your name.
[time=1341] You are our God and worthy of praise.
[time=1345] We come to you today to give to you the adoration of our hearts and the worship of our lips.
[time=1354] We come today to receive from you the strong steadfast blessing of your presence in our life and ask you to be a force of strength and sustaining power.
[time=1367] We pray for special grace for those who are recovering in the hospital, for Bill Adler as he recovers from a stroke that you will give strength to his spirit as well as his body, for Gail Clark.
[time=1381] And we need a Lowry as they recovery for our surgery, for Melody Talbot with complications in her pregnancy.
[time=1390] We pray particularly today for Magdi Habashi and the loss of his father.
[time=1395] Pray that you will comfort him in this uniquely stressful time.
[time=1400] We pray for Bob Roadenbach as he faces surgery.
[time=1405] Others this week who face difficult appointments, meetings that are filled with anxiety.
[time=1414] That you as our God might steadfastly uphold us.
[time=1419] God, we come to you with fractured lives and pieces full of confusion and strife.
[time=1428] We ask you to take over, to take our lives and to make of them something beautiful and something good.
[time=1436] For Jesus' sake, amen.
[time=1441] And He made something beautiful, something good.
[time=1456] All my confusion, He understood.
[time=1467] All I had to offer Him was brokenness and strife, but He made something beautiful of my life.
[time=1485] If there ever were dreams that were lofty and noble, those were my dreams at the start.
[time=1499] And my hope for life's best were the hopes that I harbored down deep in my heart.
[time=1510] But my dreams turned to ashes, my castles all crumbled, my fortune turned to loss.
[time=1521] So I wrapped it all in the ranks of my life and laid it at the cross.
[time=1534] Something beautiful, something good.
[time=1546] All my confusion, He understood.
[time=1557] All I had to offer Him was brokenness and strife, but He made something beautiful of my life.
[time=1579] He made something beautiful of my life.
[time=1602] Thank you, Dennis, something beautiful, something good.
[time=1611] Her life was a mess, but Jesus made of it, something beautiful and something good.
[time=1620] She had been married young in life and was divorced and now remarried.
[time=1628] Her life was a mess again.
[time=1631] She went through a second divorce and a third marriage.
[time=1636] All of that confusion, her life was a wreck.
[time=1641] She went through a third divorce and a fourth marriage and things got worse.
[time=1650] She went through another divorce and a fifth marriage and things were even worse again
[time=1661] and the fifth divorce came.
[time=1664] And she now was living with her boyfriend.
[time=1668] And that's when she met Jesus Christ and He made of her life, something beautiful and something good.
[time=1678] And she became God's spokesperson to a city in Samaria by the name of Saikar.
[time=1684] Her life was so changed that on her report, many of the men of that town believed.
[time=1691] Can't even tell you her name, but I can tell you that the story is true.
[time=1697] We know her by this simple description, the woman at the well, who Jesus transformed her life.
[time=1705] Five marriages, five divorces and a live-in boyfriend into something beautiful and something good.
[time=1714] If you have your Bible today, I invite you to study this chapter of the Bible with me, John 4.
[time=1721] We're looking at the life of Christ and have deserved a number of facets, but now observing the acceptance of Christ.
[time=1728] Was He accepted as Messiah?
[time=1730] This stands as one of John's hallmark examples of the acceptance of Christ.
[time=1736] In verses 1 through 4, we find Jesus' cause for going through Samaria, opposition in Jerusalem.
[time=1745] The balance of the chapter focuses in on His conversation with the woman at the well and the consequences that followed.
[time=1755] I have broken down their conversation into five parts and we alluded to the first two last week.
[time=1762] Allow me to pick up right at that point.
[time=1765] The woman at the well, Jesus begins his conversation in verse 7 with a very direct question.
[time=1773] He says, "Could I have a drink?" That's hardly unique, it's probably 120 degrees in the shade.
[time=1782] Jesus has no water.
[time=1784] Somebody shows up with a bucket and the long rope and they dangle it over the side of a well
[time=1790] and he can hear the bucket splash in the bottom.
[time=1794] He can hear the bucket as it gently bangs the side of the well as it's being raised.
[time=1800] He can hear the slosh of it as it spills over the sides.
[time=1804] Yes, an obvious question.
[time=1810] Could I have a drink?
[time=1813] But what was unusual about that request is it came from Jesus, a Jew, to a woman, a Samaritan.
[time=1823] And Jews and Samaritans didn't exchange even friendly conversations.
[time=1829] Poor fracturing is the fact that he is a Jew ish man and she is a Samaritan woman.
[time=1837] And in that culture, men did not talk to women in public, particularly to strangers.
[time=1844] Even more divisive was her reputation.
[time=1847] Five husbands, five divorces, a six man as a living.
[time=1854] So it was a bit unusual for Jesus to talk to her.
[time=1858] But he did.
[time=1861] The second part of the conversation, after Jesus requests water and she is amazed that he would talk to her, he says to her in verse 10, what I call a divine offer.
[time=1875] Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asked you for a drink,
[time=1882] you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."
[time=1889] "Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep.
[time=1897] Where can you get this living water?
[time=1900] Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself,
[time=1906] as did his sons and his flocks and his herds?"
[time=1912] Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.
[time=1920] But whoever drinks of the water I give him will never thirst.
[time=1923] Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water willing up to eternal life."
[time=1934] The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water that I won't get thirsty and have
[time=1941] to keep coming here to draw water." Jesus makes a divine offer.
[time=1948] We read into it and clearly see that he's making a spiritual offer and she takes it far
[time=1954] more concrete as some type of magic that this guy can give her some type of water that she'll
[time=1960] never be thirsty again and she'll never have to come here in the heat of the day.
[time=1964] She won't have to lug this bucket and rope along.
[time=1969] Sounds like a pretty good deal.
[time=1971] In Greek mythology there was a story told about a man who had a magic clay.
[time=1976] And this magic clay would produce water.
[time=1980] And so the man took the magic clay and he put it in his well.
[time=1985] And that way his well would never run dry.
[time=1988] Others wells went dry but according to Greek mythology he had the magic clay and his well wouldn't go dry.
[time=1993] But one day the man got wise and he said, "Why put the clay at the bottom of the well?
[time=1997] Then I've got to drop the bucket down and pull it back up.
[time=2001] I'll put the clay in my bucket.
[time=2003] I'll never have to do that again.
[time=2005] I'll just put the bucket in the house like always go to the bucket.
[time=2009] I'll always be water." He got tired of taking his cup over to the bucket and he said, "I'll take the clay out of the bucket and I'll put the clay right in the ladle.
[time=2021] And then I won't even have to go to the bucket when I want to drink.
[time=2023] I can just drink it from the ladle." Man said, "Why should I put it in the ladle?
[time=2028] I could just put a little bit of that in my mouth and I'd always have water.
[time=2034] I'd never need to drink again." Maybe she was a familiar student of the Greeks and had heard that mythological tale and thought, "Does Jesus have the magic clay?" She should have been wiser than that.
[time=2049] She had the scriptures and should have known that throughout the Old Testament living water is used as a synonym and a title for God Himself.
[time=2060] For example, in Isaiah chapter 55 verse 1, it says, "God is living water, springs of life."
[time=2067] Psalm 36 also tells us that God is living water as does Zechariah 14.
[time=2074] But if you have a Bible, flip back to an Old Testament prophet by the name of Jeremiah.
[time=2080] If you can find Psalms, it's shortly after Psalms, it goes Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes.
[time=2086] Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah.
[time=2091] Jeremiah, the prophet, speaks about God, the living water in chapter 2 verse 13.
[time=2103] My people have committed two sins.
[time=2106] One, they have forsaken me the spring of living water and two have dug their own cisterns,
[time=2115] broken cisterns that can hold no water.
[time=2119] Here's one of those passages in the Old Testament where God's described as being living water
[time=2125] in the source of it.
[time=2126] In Jeremiah the prophet speaking for God says to Israel, "You've committed two different sins." First of all, here I am, a source of living water, a spring that will bubble up and you've
[time=2137] abandoned me and you have turned instead to dig out your own cisterns.
[time=2143] A cistern in those days would be a piece of rock clay that they would actually dig out
[time=2149] and then when the rains would come they would divert the water into the cistern and the water
[time=2155] would be retained.
[time=2156] But let's face it, which would you rather have?
[time=2160] Water that's been sitting around since last spring's rain or fresh bubbling spring water.
[time=2168] No choice.
[time=2169] God says, "You've chosen to reject me the springs of living water instead for old musty
[time=2176] water that's sat in cisterns." God says worse than that, your cisterns are cracked.
[time=2181] They don't hold water.
[time=2184] What water you do have is leaking away.
[time=2188] Both in Jeremiah and in John, God and Jesus are using this physical illustration to identify
[time=2197] spiritual reality that in our lives there is a thirsting, a thirsting of our soul.
[time=2208] And we disregard the only source that can never satisfy that.
[time=2216] Throughout history, philosophers and common people, people of every walk of life have diagnosed the human heart accurately as having an inner thirst and one that only God can fill.
[time=2228] Augustine 400 years AD lived a life of great abandonment.
[time=2233] If there was a pleasure and he wanted it, he tried it.
[time=2236] But in his late adolescence he began to see the futility.
[time=2240] And then in young adulthood, Augustine said, "Our heart is restless, O God, until we
[time=2246] find our rest in thee." It was Pascal, the French philosopher who said, "God has created us for himself, and he has made us with a vacuum on the inside, shaped in such a way that he alone can fill it."
[time=2266] Sinclair Lewis put these words in the mouth of one of his characters.
[time=2270] She says to him, "On the outside you and I look very, very different.
[time=2275] But on the inside, we are fundamentally the same.
[time=2280] For you see, each of us is desperately unhappy about something, and we don't know what it is."
[time=2291] God says, "I have put a thirst inside of each of you, a thirst that I alone can satisfy."
[time=2299] You know, in our times we have that thirst, but we try to satisfy it with something else than allegiance and devotion to Christ.
[time=2308] Many of us think, "Oh, if I could just get that dream home, that one we've driven by it
[time=2314] a dozen times at least, if we could just get that house, then we would really be happy."
[time=2320] Kathy and I found that house, and we drove by it, and it was for sale.
[time=2324] We bought that, it was a dream house.
[time=2326] Great price, monthly payments were very manageable, and we were sure to be happy, because we could handle that monthly payment.
[time=2333] On the door was a little plaque, we didn't notice.
[time=2336] This little plaque said that this was an award-winning home as a total electric home.
[time=2341] It was put there by an electric company.
[time=2344] We had electric cable ceiling heat, and in the winter time, our electric bill would be
[time=2350] as high as our mortgage payment.
[time=2353] This is no joke.
[time=2354] We did receive a thank you note from the utility company.
[time=2360] We thought, "Oh, if we just had that house, oh, then we'd be happy." Houses don't fill heart.
[time=2367] Some of us look at houses or cars, some of us look at our job.
[time=2371] Boy, if I could just get off that lap.
[time=2373] Boy, if I was up there and I could look down at where, then I'd be happy.
[time=2377] We get that, and we discover what Evie Hill said.
[time=2380] We spend our life climbing the proverbial ladder of success to discover, once we're at the top,
[time=2387] somebody leaned it on the wrong wall.
[time=2392] Success doesn't satisfy that inner longing.
[time=2396] I like the woman at the well.
[time=2398] Many of us put our life on the line, and we say, "Oh, it's my relationship."
[time=2404] If she would just marry me, we'd be so happy.
[time=2407] She says, "If he would just marry me, I'd live in a shack." They marry each other.
[time=2413] He wants to wall paper, she wants to head on to the shack.
[time=2416] They're not happy anymore.
[time=2418] Larry Crab once described Mary just two ticks looking for a dog.
[time=2423] (Laughter) Let's be honest with ourselves, we are all parasites.
[time=2430] And we think, "Oh, if I just had that person, I'd be happy." And we draw the life out of each other.
[time=2437] No house, no promotion, no human relationship will fill.
[time=2441] The depth of the longing of our heart.
[time=2444] This woman tried to fill it with one relationship after another, after another, and after the fifth relationship.
[time=2451] It ended, and she's now trying six.
[time=2456] But she takes Jesus' offer as concrete.
[time=2460] I doubt that she really misunderstood.
[time=2463] I think Jesus was getting close.
[time=2466] He was beginning to take his finger and put it on the pulse of her soul.
[time=2473] And he sensed her longing and her emptiness, and he started to tell her that it could be filled, but she wanted to back away from the spiritual conversation.
[time=2483] It was getting too close.
[time=2488] Nicodemus did the same thing.
[time=2490] Jesus used an analogy of physical birth, the spiritual birth.
[time=2494] He said, "The Nicodemus, you've got to be born again." And Nicodemus says, "What am I supposed to become?
[time=2498] The incredible, shrinking man?" Jesus said, "No, I'm talking in spiritual language." This woman does the same thing.
[time=2507] Jesus offers her living water, and she says, "Where's your bucket, buddy?" You don't get a rope.
[time=2514] Who do you think you are?
[time=2515] Jacob dug this well.
[time=2517] Are you going to tell me you're better and braver and stronger and more capable than Jacob?
[time=2525] She missed the point.
[time=2528] Or did she?
[time=2532] After this divine offer, the conversation changes in verse 16.
[time=2539] Jesus gives her what I call a diagnostic question.
[time=2546] He said, "I don't want to keep coming to draw water, so I'll take your living water." Verse 16, Jesus told her, "Go call your husband and come back."
[time=2558] "I have no husband," she replied.
[time=2562] Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.
[time=2566] The fact is you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband.
[time=2573] You have just said, and it is quite true." I call this a diagnostic question because Jesus obviously not only knew the need of her heart
[time=2585] for living water, he knew how she was trying to meet a legitimate need in an illegitimate way.
[time=2592] She was trying to go from one relationship after another thinking, "This person will make me happy.
[time=2598] This marriage will work. This union will finally satisfy."
[time=2606] And Jesus puts his finger right on her pulse.
[time=2612] Because he's God, he knows every need of her life, and he says to her, "Go get your husband and come back." Sounds very legitimate.
[time=2620] A lot of times I'll be visiting someone in their home and they'll say, "Oh, gee, I wish my wife was here. I wish my husband were here." Let's say, "Would you like me to come back another week when we all can sit down and talk?" But Jesus wasn't simply being gentlemanly and saying, "Let's include your husband in the conversation." He was using this as a sharp, scalpel, probing on the inside and saying to her,
[time=2645] "Go get your husband because he knew that would touch off the issue of life."
[time=2652] Many times people have said to me, the message Sunday morning,
[time=2659] "Are you talking about me? Let me assure you of two things.
[time=2664] One, I don't make it my habit to find out what you did this week and bring it up on Sunday morning.
[time=2671] Two, there are too many of you. I'd be here all morning bringing things up."
[time=2679] No, I'd never do that.
[time=2682] And you know why? I don't need to do that because God is able to take message A that I give that you share in a Sunday school class that somebody sings in a song, a scripture that's read, and it has as its theme, point A, and by the time it hits your heart, God's Spirit says, "I think I'll redirect it right over here to another need." And pardon the slight, it zaps you right where your spiritual need is.
[time=2708] I wish that those of us who are here could take the credit for it, but we have a secret weapon called the Holy Spirit, and he diagnoses hearts like no human could ever do it.
[time=2720] And he may make you discomforted every time you hear the word because he is the diagnosing agent of God.
[time=2731] And Jesus diagnoses this woman and says, "Bring your husband here." And she says, "I don't have a husband." Thinking, "Oh, that'll end the conversation." And Jesus, because he's God knows everything, he says, "That's right. You don't.
[time=2748] You've had five, but you're living with number six." Now, the coin, a phrase from a popular song of last year, "The Heat is On." I mean, she is feeling it bad now.
[time=2761] I mean, how would you like it if somebody you have never met in your life before said, "Fred, how are you? You know what I know about you?
[time=2768] What do you know about me?" And they read you like a book from the inside out.
[time=2775] And so the next part of their conversations, what I call the dodge.
[time=2781] Charles Dickens created a character in one of his books called the Artful Dodger.
[time=2786] And every one of us have been trying to emulate the Artful Dodger ever since.
[time=2791] I'm sure you've had a teacher like my ninth-grade English teacher, Mr. Syroid.
[time=2797] Mr. Syroid was not a bad English teacher, but he had one fatal flaw for an educator.
[time=2803] And that is he was about as easy to derail as a Lionel train under the tree.
[time=2810] And every Friday he would lecture for half of the hour, and then he'd give us a quiz the second half of the hour.
[time=2816] And every Friday we'd stand out in the hallway and say, "You ask him." "Oh, I get last week. You ask him. We'd finally get one guy whose job it is to ask him." Mr. Syroid had fought in World War II.
[time=2827] Sure bet.
[time=2829] You let him get about ten minutes into his lecture, and you raised your hand and say, "Mr. Syroid, remember you told us you were in World War II? Where were you stationed?
[time=2836] He was good for the hour! No more lecture, no more tests, no more quiz."
[time=2842] And he was derailed. Jesus puts his finger right on this woman's button, and she says,
[time=2852] "I got to derail this guy." So look at verse 19. She says, "Sir, I can see that you are a prophet."
[time=2864] A little flattery goes a long way, you know, set him up.
[time=2868] Being a prophet, help me out here.
[time=2872] Our father's worshiped on this mountain, and no doubt she was referring.
[time=2876] Maybe I'm gesturing to Mount Gerizim, where Sandballat the Samaritan had built a rival temple.
[time=2884] But you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.
[time=2892] Jesus is getting too personal now. This husband business.
[time=2897] So she says, "Maybe I can derail him. Get him off the track onto a whole new issue."
[time=2903] And so she poses it, "You know, I'm glad you came by. You really seem sharp.
[time=2908] You look like a prophet. Every day I come here to this well, and as I draw water, I sit here thinking.
[time=2914] Now I wonder, is that the right place to worship or not? Boy, I'm glad you came by.
[time=2920] Maybe you can help me." No. She was dodging the issue. Many of us do that.
[time=2929] I can remember when I was being victimized by the Holy Spirit who made me feel guilty
[time=2937] and kept saying to me, "You need to give your life to Christ, and I didn't want to give my life to Christ."
[time=2944] And a friend in high school was telling me about the Lord Jesus, and I said, "You know, that's all Bible stuff.
[time=2949] And the Bible's got lots of mistakes in them." He said, "I didn't know that. Show me one.
[time=2958] I didn't know one. I wasn't pondering the process of studying the scriptures,
[time=2967] analyzing them to see if there were errors I just thought I can derail this guy.
[time=2972] I'll get him debating the Bible, and he didn't fall for it.
[time=2977] Many of us try to dodge God.
[time=2982] We come up with questions like this.
[time=2985] You may be sharing Christ with an individual, and as you're telling them about the Lord and how much the Lord loves them, they say, "Well, what happens to the guy who lives on the Amazon River?
[time=2993] And the boat goes by and doesn't give him a Bible. He dies never hearing about Jesus." Do you really believe that guy was up all night, the night before, wondering what happens to that poor, ocky Indian on the Amazon River?
[time=3007] Kind of chance. He's simply trying to dodge the issue.
[time=3012] Well, if God's such a just God, why did he let Adolf Hitler kill millions upon millions of his chosen people?
[time=3020] I've learned something about the dodge.
[time=3025] If by any chance you have studied and prepared well and somebody throws at you an in answerable question
[time=3032] and you answer it, they will not say, "Thank you. You answered my question.
[time=3039] Now I can come to Christ in faith and confidence." No, they will say.
[time=3043] Well, then if you've answered that one, let me ask you this one.
[time=3046] How many angels can dance on the head of a pen at the same time?
[time=3050] You see, there are two types of interrogatives. Questions of the mind would say, "Help me to understand." And objections of the will would say, "I don't want to understand." And if you are trying to dodge God,
[time=3065] an objection of the will will only be followed by another objection of the will disguised as a sincere question.
[time=3076] But God will not be dodged.
[time=3080] And so Jesus hears the woman ask the question, "This mountain or that mountain in verse 21," he declares,
[time=3086] "Believe me, woman. A time is coming. When you will worship the Father, neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem."
[time=3095] Jesus is saying, "Mountains are not the issue here, lady.
[time=3102] You Samaritan worship what you do not know." You've missed the point, he said.
[time=3107] We Jewish people worship what we do know. They were staying through the Scriptures.
[time=3112] And particularly, he says, "What we worship is this, for salvation is from the Jews." By that expression, Jesus is saying, "Out of the Jewish line will come salvation, a Savior, a Messiah."
[time=3125] And Jesus says, "That is going to come out of the Jews." Then he says, "Yet a time is coming." Well, she understood that. That's prophecy.
[time=3137] But notice this, he says, "And now it has already come.
[time=3142] When true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers, the Father seeks.
[time=3150] God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."
[time=3157] The woman said, "I know that Messiah called Christ, Messiah Hebrew, Christ same word Greek, is coming.
[time=3165] When he comes, he will explain everything to us." She fully understood what Jesus was saying when he said, "Salvation is going to come from the Jews." She said, "I know a Messiah is coming. I know he is coming from the Jews." And when he comes, everything will be put into perspective.
[time=3182] She tries to dodge the issue, and Jesus comes back and he says, "Who cares?
[time=3188] Whether you worship in Jerusalem or whether you worship on Mount Gerasim, the time is coming.
[time=3196] It's now when you've got to come to God in spirit and in truth."
[time=3203] That brings us to the fifth and final part of their conversation, the direct part,
[time=3210] where Jesus directly reveals himself.
[time=3215] She said, "I know that Messiah, the Christ is coming.
[time=3218] When he comes, he'll teach us everything." And Jesus looks at her and says, "Woman, I that speak to you, M.H.
[time=3229] You may have been hit up by what all labels some liberal teaching which said, "Oh, Jesus never claimed to be God." He never said he was the Messiah.
[time=3239] They missed John 4 with a dozen or more other verses.
[time=3243] Jesus said, "Messiah, I am he." Jesus is using a tactic that we call bottom line communication.
[time=3253] It started off as an accounting term, but bottom line communication is this.
[time=3257] If you look at our new church budget, there'll probably be 50 lines that says, "People spend this much, staff will spend that much, youth will spend this much, and they'll go down a whole legal page." And then at the bottom, there's what we call the bottom line.
[time=3271] Here's how much it costs to operate our church for a week.
[time=3275] That is the bottom line.
[time=3277] Men, we tend to be bottom line personalities.
[time=3281] Husband comes home from work, wife comes home from work.
[time=3285] They ask each other the same question, "How was your day?" He says to her, "How was your day?" She says, "Well, I got up, and when I plug in the curlers, the fuse pop," and she takes them through the day.
[time=3297] At the end of all that, she says, "Honey, how was your day?" And he says, "Fine. The bottom line."
[time=3307] Jesus has had a lengthy conversation with this woman, but the time comes to get to the bottom line.
[time=3314] Let's stop talking about buckets and wells.
[time=3317] Let's talk instead about the bottom line.
[time=3321] Let's stop talking about husbands and living boyfriends and mountains and temples and Samaritans and Jews and men and women.
[time=3330] The bottom line Jesus said is, "I am the Christ."
[time=3336] And now she has to make the obvious choice to accept it or to reject it.
[time=3346] In verses 27 through 42, we see the conclusion.
[time=3354] Three different reactions.
[time=3356] Reaction number one, the reaction of the disciples.
[time=3359] Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman.
[time=3365] But no one asked, "What do you want? Why are you talking with her?"
[time=3371] Then leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, "Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did.
[time=3380] Could this be the Christ?" They came out of the town and they made their way toward him.
[time=3387] Meanwhile, his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something." That proves the original disciples were Baptist.
[time=3394] "Rabbi, eat something." But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know anything about."
[time=3403] Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"
[time=3410] "My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work."
[time=3419] The reaction of the disciples is unfortunate.
[time=3422] They are preoccupied with the cares of life.
[time=3425] They are off buying food when they get back.
[time=3428] They are kind of prejudiced.
[time=3429] They say, "Hey, what is he doing, talking to a woman, a Samaritan at that?"
[time=3436] "Well, anyway, Jesus, we have got the food. Eat something."
[time=3442] Jesus said to them, "I have food you do not know anything about." He said, "Somebody bring in a carryout from halls? What do you mean you got food?" We didn't see anybody else here.
[time=3452] He said, "No, my food is to do the will of him who sent me." Have you ever got so excited about a project at work?
[time=3460] You just kept working on it and you worked right through dinner and you didn't realize it?
[time=3464] Have you ever been working out in the back yard and you were cutting the grass and edging?
[time=3469] The whole yard was starting to look good.
[time=3472] You realize you missed lunch?
[time=3474] Some of you say, "Ah, not a chance." But you know in life when you have a purpose, that purpose can motivate you and consume you
[time=3484] that it goes far beyond any physical need.
[time=3487] Jesus said, "I'm motivated by a purpose of reaching this world, and it's far more important to meet them food."
[time=3497] The reaction to the woman is the exciting one.
[time=3500] You can pick up her excitement because this woman not only heads back into town to tell others about Christ,
[time=3508] but it says she ran off in such a hurry, she left her water jar.
[time=3513] If you just walked a half a mile to get water, you would not leave it unless you had just found something.
[time=3520] It's been a privilege today to share with you the ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and our soloist Kathy Hawks
[time=3526] and Dennis Kirschner and our ladies ensemble rejoices they ministered through the medium of music.
[time=3532] I hope you enjoyed the message too from our Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3536] Just before we close today, if you sense the need for Christ to come into your heart, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3543] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3545] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3552] And today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3556] I know that you'll forgive me of my sins and I ask you to do that today and to come into my life
[time=3562] and make my life clean and pure.
[time=3564] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3568] If you prayed that prayer this morning, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3572] And then when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
