[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) God's Word is like a sword penetrating into our hearts.
[time=118] It often tells us not what we want to hear, but what it is that we need to hear.
[time=123] It has the effect in our life as Socrates had on one man.
[time=127] The man once said to the philosopher, "Socrates, I hate seeing you, because every time I see you, you tell me who I am, and I don't like it."
[time=138] [MUSIC]
[time=149] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=153] Thank you for joining us.
[time=155] Rick's message today is entitled, "The State of the Church." Often in life, what we want to hear and what we need to hear are not the same.
[time=163] The God's Word both encourages us and corrects us.
[time=167] Today's message is on the state of the church and comes from Paul's Word to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4.
[time=174] Paul's instructions were timeless as fresh today as when Timothy first read them.
[time=180] Many of these words are encouraging. Some are corrective. Both are needed.
[time=185] Join us as we assess the state of the church and the state of each of our lives.
[time=190] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=194] Today's program includes a song from the Sanctuary Choir and soloist Keith Roddagum,
[time=200] a piano solo from Scott Schindler, and special music by the Black Hawk Singers.
[time=207] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=213] and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=216] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=220] [MUSIC]
[time=235] Jesus who died, now glorified King of all kings.
[time=241] We've come today to worship the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed is King of kings and Lord of lords.
[time=248] We're so thankful you've come out on this cold, cold morning.
[time=253] It is cold, there's snow on the ground, and the wind is blowing, and you could have used that as an excuse to stay away, but you didn't.
[time=261] We're so thankful you've come that we can see each other face to face and lift up our voices in praise.
[time=267] Thanks for being bold on these cold Sundays. We're delighted that you're here.
[time=272] We also want to welcome our friends who are joining us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=277] We trust that today God's Word will dwell in your hearts richly and give you a confidence
[time=283] and an inner strength that will serve you every day of your life.
[time=287] We worship Christ because He came and He died on the cross for our sins.
[time=293] He arose again to prove that He is Lord, but the Scripture also announces that He's coming again,
[time=300] and the next time He comes He's coming for me and for you.
[time=305] Keith Rodigan in our choir sing in an excellent way of the fact that Jesus Christ is coming again.
[time=330] From the lofty courts of heaven came above on earth to bloom,
[time=339] knowing when He left His Father, that His faith would be the tool.
[time=348] But the grave it could not hold Him, angels rolled the stone away.
[time=356] Now the mighty rose of Sharon is still blooming yet today.
[time=364] But the next time He comes He will have to die for me.
[time=373] But the next time He comes there won't be a cavalry.
[time=382] The next time He comes He will remain unto the town.
[time=390] And when He comes to come He will be coming for me.

[time=2073] Thank you, Black Hawk Singers.
[time=2075] This Sunday morning is the morning of the day that we have our annual business meeting.
[time=2080] We wanted to give you an update by way of slides as the progress on the new building and take just a few moments to talk about the state of our church.
[time=2089] It was just a few weeks ago that President Reagan gave the state of the union address.
[time=2094] He came before a joint session of Congress and the justices of the Supreme Court and the American people and from his perspective gave the state of the union
[time=2105] of the United States of America.
[time=2107] That is a message worth our hearing.
[time=2110] It is a time when we as a people take inventory and assess how is it with our country?
[time=2116] What are the areas that there have been growth?
[time=2119] What are the areas that there are needs?
[time=2121] I believe God would have us to do that in our lives constantly.
[time=2126] Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living.
[time=2130] It is in 2 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=2133] The Bible says from the mouth of Paul but the Spirit of God to examine ourselves.
[time=2138] So to take a few moments and to address the state of the church is worthy of our time.
[time=2144] The year 1987 was not a good year for churches in America and in the Western culture.
[time=2153] Because of events that transpired in national news media, events that surrounded prominent individuals who have been now labeled till evangelists,
[time=2163] there have been attacks on Christianity as a whole more than simply the attack on the media industry in particular.
[time=2173] Words like integrity have been used to attack, not to defend the work of various ministries.
[time=2182] And so in this past year, religion, Christianity, particularly evangelical Christianity,
[time=2190] particularly those evangelicals who are involved in television ministries
[time=2196] have come under enormous criticism and enormous scrutiny,
[time=2202] although perhaps the scrutiny has come too late.
[time=2206] One analysis of what was taking place in early '87 said, what we're seeing in the national rhyme light will indeed bring more scrutiny on the televangelists,
[time=2219] but it will not hurt the local churches.
[time=2221] In fact, it may result in many people turning back to the local church where they know the people,
[time=2227] they see what's being done and there is accountability.
[time=2231] In many ways, that analysis has come true.
[time=2234] But while it's been a difficult year on the national scene, it's good for us to remember two other extremes.
[time=2241] First of all, in the international scene, it's such a joy to be able to report that the Church of Jesus Christ is more than a ministry that's located in some suburb of America.
[time=2253] That Jesus Christ's kingdom is beyond this generation and it's beyond our neighborhood.
[time=2260] And there are churches around the world that are today standing clear and strong for Jesus Christ.
[time=2267] It was such a privilege to be in Kofu two years ago at this time and to see Japanese brothers and sisters who could care less about American media name the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2279] They're faithfully serving him this Sunday morning at Christ's Church at Kofu with pastor Sosie Midsiguchi.
[time=2287] It was a joy to learn that since we've been to Manila, that Ken and Alice Cole have started Heritage Baptist Church and out of nothing, they have started the Church and this Sunday morning there will be more than 100 people in a church that is only five months old, worshiping Jesus Christ in the suburbs of Manila, the Philippines.
[time=2308] This past week, some of the men of the Church went with me to establish emissions based in Jamaica.
[time=2314] And there we met Paul Neil in Bull Savannah.
[time=2318] Have you ever heard of Bull Savannah, Jamaica?
[time=2321] It's a small little village and there aren't houses lining the suburbs but out of these hills come people and 100 people this morning will be worshiping Christ in Bull Savannah because Paul Neil Jamaican is declaring Jesus Christ.
[time=2337] There wasn't a church there a year ago and today 100 will be there.
[time=2343] In Mandeville, Larry Smith, a missionary that we support began working with a new Jamaican pastor by the name of David Cranston and now Calvary Baptist Church stands on the main highway of Mandeville
[time=2358] and it is a lighthouse into that community for Jesus Christ.
[time=2362] You know what?
[time=2363] They don't have televisions and they're not altered by what happens in the media.
[time=2368] And then not only on the international scene but on the local scene.
[time=2372] What has God done in this church?
[time=2375] We've tried to use the slides a few moments ago to say that a dream has become a reality that God is indeed working in this place.
[time=2383] But allow me to bore you with a little history and a few statistics.
[time=2387] Now you have to be careful when you use statistics and you hear statistics.
[time=2391] One of our deacons said a few months back in a business meeting that we were having you know we need to be careful with figures because figures don't lie but liars do figure.
[time=2401] And I want to be honest with figures today and not just use those.
[time=2406] But four years ago we began a five year plan as it related the facilities of our church.
[time=2414] That five year plan had these steps.
[time=2416] Step one get out of debt.
[time=2418] Our accounts payable were behind and God answered that in honestly a miraculous way.
[time=2425] People gave the Lord provided the debt was taken care of almost immediately.
[time=2430] The second step was to create funds to eliminate bond payments by selling land.
[time=2436] And in 1984 we sold half of Arlington Park and in 1985 the other half.
[time=2442] The next step was to design a facility and then to have a capital funds drive.
[time=2447] You have experienced all of that.
[time=2450] God has provided for that.
[time=2452] But we had another five year plan that wasn't as announced quite as often.
[time=2457] It was a five year plan for internal growth.
[time=2460] People type growth.
[time=2461] And the resources to reach people.
[time=2464] In 1983 when the five year plan began our average Sunday morning attendance was one thousand
[time=2471] and sixty people.
[time=2473] We would pray and targeted for growth of ten percent a year.
[time=2478] That's not very realistic.
[time=2479] That's exceptional growth when there aren't expanded facilities and opportunities like that.
[time=2485] A hundred percent would be a lot.
[time=2487] For us over the last four years to have had ten percent growth we would have averaged last
[time=2493] year fifteen hundred and seventy three people.
[time=2497] Unfortunately we did not make that goal of averaging fifteen seventy three.
[time=2502] We averaged fifteen sixty three.
[time=2505] And what I need to know is where were you the last Sunday of last year.
[time=2509] You would turn over your car.
[time=2511] You would like to take attendance for that Sunday and know where you ten were during the past year.
[time=2516] God has blessed us.
[time=2517] That growth has come primarily because of the people who are sitting here today saying
[time=2523] I will be a witness for Christ and inviting friends and sharing the gospel.
[time=2530] Well with those growth in terms of attendance would need to be growth in terms of revenue to make ministry available.
[time=2537] And so we had projected that by last year our annual giving would be one million one hundred
[time=2544] and thirty thousand dollars.
[time=2546] Last year our giving not to the building program not to television not to the school just our regular giving.
[time=2552] It needed to be one million one hundred and thirty.
[time=2555] Was one million one hundred and sixty five thousand dollars.
[time=2559] God has provided for this church in enormous ways.
[time=2563] But of that financial growth we determined that over those five years in this eighty eight
[time=2570] is year five we're beginning.
[time=2572] We in the area of finances wanted to see the giving of this church to missions double.
[time=2579] And we're encouraged to say to you that if you approve our budget tonight this isn't meant to be a little leverage approve the budget.
[time=2587] But with the approval of tonight's budget we will not only double our mission's giving but our mission's giving will be ten thousand dollars more than double what it was four years ago.
[time=2599] Because of that missionaries have been sent out.
[time=2603] But the measure of a church is not how many people does it hold.
[time=2606] How much money does it collect the measure of a church is how many people does it send for it.
[time=2612] Over the last years here are some of the people who have been a part of our church that have been sent forth.
[time=2619] I hope this encourages you as much as it does me.
[time=2623] Today Lori Eby Hunt is serving Christ in Missouri.
[time=2628] She came to know the Lord on a Sunday evening service when she accepted Christ right there where Tim and Lori are seated.
[time=2635] She went through operation outreach learned to share her faith.
[time=2638] Went to Purdue work with campus crusades and she's now serving the Lord with her husband in Missouri.
[time=2645] Denny and Debbie Howard work with youth for Christ in Germany then moved to Oregon now serving the Lord here in Fort Wayne.
[time=2654] The cereballs went behind there in Curtin and there they were ambassadors for Christ with the navigators.
[time=2660] Now they're working to train other international missionaries and working with international students at Michigan State University.
[time=2667] The ballast have spent four years in Manila. They have just returned for a new term.
[time=2674] They're learning to gala that they might learn the language to be more effective in sharing Christ.
[time=2680] Ruth Yocum is a nurse in Bangladesh.
[time=2683] Everett Shurg has left his employment to work with CBMC here in our community.
[time=2688] Tammy Hopkins Crane came to know Christ through this church in its youth ministry.
[time=2693] Many years ago learned to share her faith. She and her husband are now in Africa as medical missionaries.
[time=2699] Marcia Jones-Feltner and her husband spent two years in Peru.
[time=2703] You got to meet them last year at the end of the year.
[time=2706] The balls are in Panama serving the Lord. Lori Sells on a mercy ship.
[time=2711] Mary Cruz is in Japan.
[time=2713] Along with all these people each summer we send out between six and a dozen short term missionaries.
[time=2719] Our goal this year is to send 24 to 30 people to Mandeville Jamaica to strengthen two churches and to start another.
[time=2728] We share these things not that we want to say, "Oh, we're doing well."
[time=2735] We want to say that you might know that Jesus Christ and his church, it is alive and it is well in the state of his eternal union.
[time=2747] But history is good.
[time=2750] But the measure of a man or the measure of a church is not what he has done, but what he is doing for the kingdom today.
[time=2760] And so with a little history, now let's look to the future. Do you have your Bible today?
[time=2765] I invite you to open it the 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 1 where Paul challenged Timothy for the future.
[time=2772] Paul could have said, "It's the end of my life. I want to look back and I want to talk about Corinth." You know, I planted a church in Corinth. Paul could have said, "Oh, I remember Ephesus boy, did I handle a tough situation?"
[time=2784] Well, an Ephesus. He could have said, "Remember what I said on Mars, Hill and Athens and how out of that came a church?"
[time=2792] But Paul wasn't content with history. He had an eye for the future. Now he challenged Timothy to pick up the baton in the run.
[time=2801] Here's what Paul's perhaps probable final words to Timothy were. Second Timothy for one.
[time=2810] In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge.
[time=2827] Preach the word. Be prepared in season and out of season. Correct, rebuke, encourage with great patience and careful instruction.
[time=2844] For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
[time=2861] They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. But you keep your head in all situations in your hardship.
[time=2877] Do the work of an evangelist. Discharge all of the duties of your ministry.
[time=2887] For I am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure.
[time=2899] Paul gives the Timothy instructions for the future. Actually in these six verses there are nine different commands, military like instructions to operate in the days ahead.
[time=2914] But before he gives him his methodology, Paul gives him his motivation. He says I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus.
[time=2926] What was it that was the motivate Timothy? What was it that would make his charge effective?
[time=2932] It was to remember that he served God himself. Would his motivation simply be what would make him popular in the eyes of people?
[time=2942] Would he preach what this group really wanted to hear? Would he say the things that got him into favor with the popular group?
[time=2952] Would his reference point be to please God? Mark Twain said a public opinion. Everyone hears its voice.
[time=2964] Some think that it's the voice of God. Paul said the Timothy, your charge is not to follow public opinion, but your charge is to please the one who has called you.
[time=2977] Paul's motivation was more than anything else. He wanted to hear the Lord Jesus say two words, the day he entered heaven, just two. Well done.
[time=2991] And that should be the very motivation of our life. Whether we are successful in the eyes of men or not, whether some say we're eloquent or others say we're boring,
[time=3001] then it might be the driving force of our life that we would want to hear him say just two words. Well done.
[time=3011] It's interesting. Paul uses the title Christ before the name Jesus. We usually speak of our Lord Jesus Christ, but here Paul says, and before Christ Jesus.
[time=3024] That takes the emphasis away from his humanity, the suffering, compassionate Christ, and brings the emphasis upon his deity and his authority.
[time=3035] And now he describes Christ in three motivating ways. First of all, he said Christ, who will judge the living and the dead?
[time=3046] First see Christ as a ruling judge. Every person who has ever lived, who is living, or who will ever live, will stand before Christ as a ruling judge.
[time=3063] Some people will stand before him when he is seated on his white throne, and the whiteness speaks for the purity of his judgment, and we call it out of the scriptures, the great white throne judgment.
[time=3078] Anyone who has never put their faith and trust in Christ will stand before Christ, the ruling judge, seated on his white throne, and because of sin in their life that has been uncovered and unforgiven, they will find their eternity in hell.
[time=3099] Those of us who have been forgiven by simply receiving Christ will stand before Christ, not on his white throne judgment, when he stands as the Greeks called it on his Beimah seat.
[time=3112] It's called the judgment seat of Christ, and every believer will stand before Christ and his judgment seat.
[time=3119] We will not be judged as to destination of heaven or hell that has been held secure by Christ if we have received him, we have heaven.
[time=3128] But this judgment will be an evaluation of our lives. How will we enter that heaven?
[time=3133] Will we enter it with crowns that we might have them the cast before his feet, or will we enter it embarrassed and empty-handed?
[time=3144] But Christ is the living judge, and he's the judge of the living and the dead, and Paul says, "I charge you, Timothy, before God and before Christ Jesus, who is the judge?"
[time=3157] The ruling judge.
[time=3159] Secondly, he charges him before Christ, who is not only a ruling judge, but he is a reigning conqueror.
[time=3168] If you'll notice, it says, "Who is the judge of the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing?"
[time=3176] The Greek word, therefore, appearing is a word that we hear occasionally in religious circles. It's the word epiphany.
[time=3183] Perhaps you've noticed in our town, there are churches that have, as their name, epiphany. That word means appearing.
[time=3191] Here it means that when Christ appears, as Keith and the choir sang about a moment ago, Jesus is coming, and the next time he's coming, he is appearing for me and for you.
[time=3205] But that word epiphany, appearing, was used to speak of the conquering emperor who is now coming into a city that he has conquered, and because the conquering emperor is coming, the city is making every preparation.
[time=3223] A city like ours, if word was given, that the president of the United States was coming to make an address would make preparations.
[time=3233] Paul saying to Timothy, "Be motivated, there is a conqueror, Christ the emperor is coming, and he is about to appear, make ready for his coming."
[time=3245] Thirdly, Christ is depicted not only as the ruling judge and the returning conqueror, but as a reigning king. It says also in view of his appearing and his kingdom.
[time=3260] There is a line out of Handel's Messiah that says, "And the kingdom of this world is becoming, the kingdom of our God, and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever."
[time=3277] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus is coming, and the kingdom that is now primarily spiritual will become physical and a reality, and he will reign.
[time=3294] Paul said to Timothy, these words that Timothy might be motivated to hear now the method of which he was discerned.
[time=3303] In these next verses, Paul gives nine imperatives, and the time that we have will do barely more than listen.
[time=3311] Number one, preach the word. Now when you hear that, preach the word, you probably picture me or someone of my occupation standing before a wood pulpit with a big black book, and they are preaching the word.
[time=3323] Fine. That's not what the word means necessarily. It doesn't mean occupation. It doesn't mean Sunday morning at 11 o'clock. It actually means to be a herald, someone who makes an announcement for a king.
[time=3340] Now if you would go back into the days of the scripture, if the emperor, let's say it was the emperor of Tiberius, wanted to make a proclamation, he didn't pick up his telephone, call his press secretary and say, "Get the news cameras here. I want to make an announcement." Couldn't do that.
[time=3357] How did he get his announcement out? They had what were called preachers. I didn't use that word, but that's the word preach, Caruso's. And a Caruso would go into a town and he would stand up and he would announce in the corners in the significant places of that city what it is the king had declared.
[time=3378] Perhaps you've seen movies of early days of U.S. history when there were what were called town criers. A man would go out into a town and he would ring a bell and he would unroll the scroll and he would yell, "Here he, here he, the proclamation of King George III of England." And what he would then say would be the declaration of a king.
[time=3399] What this is saying is declare. Not me any more than you, but all of us as believers in Christ are to be declaring the word of the king.
[time=3412] We are to make him known in this kingdom and to prepare this kingdom for his coming kingdom.
[time=3419] The next command says this. Be instant, King James, which probably had nothing to do with coffee. I'm sorry to disappoint some of you. The word to be instant, better translated, be prepared.
[time=3432] Be in position, standing your ground ready to serve.
[time=3438] Perhaps this summer you saw the race where the 100 meter dash, a new world record was set.
[time=3447] When they called those people to the line, those men got prepared. They got down and they braced their feet against the starting blocks.
[time=3455] They positioned their hands on the ground as close to the line as possible and they precariously balanced their weight so as the gun went off, they had every preparation made.
[time=3466] There wasn't anybody standing at the line going, "Oh, 100 yard dash, okay." They were prepared.
[time=3475] And as believers in Jesus Christ, our life needs to be one that is prepared, prepared.
[time=3484] Standing our ground, the word has implied in it, not only standing your ground but clinging to it, holding on and not turning back.
[time=3495] We've had one great year before we stand our ground and go on.
[time=3509] It's been a privilege today to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, our pianist Scott Schindler and the music of the Black Hawk Singers, as well as the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3521] Our theme today is we've been talking about the goodness of our God and the prospect of sharing heaven with him someday.
[time=3528] I wonder if you've accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. If you've never done that, you can do it today.
[time=3534] I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3537] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3544] I thank you also for the fact that you said that if we accept you as personal Savior, we can live in heaven with you someday.
[time=3551] Lord, I pray that you'll come in and forgive me of my sins and cleanse my heart today and dwell within my life.
[time=3559] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3563] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3567] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3574] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "The Best Pocket Companion," please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East-State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3589] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request, take number 1329, or use the sermon title "State of the Church."
[time=3597] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help to pray the cost of providing this take.
[time=3613] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends. Perhaps you have thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3621] Why not do it today? I know it would be an encouragement to Pastor Rick and the entire Bible Hour staff.
[time=3627] To correspond with us, simply write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East-State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3636] Now speaking for Pastor Rick Hawks, this is Bill VR, inviting you to join us each week at this time for the Bible Hour.
