[time=115] After the assassination of Lincoln, it was Stanton, the Secretary of War, who pushed the investigation harder than anyone else.
[time=125] But before the investigation was over, an indicting finger was pointed at Stanton himself.
[time=132] Those who accused Christ found that he turned around and pointed an indicting finger at them, but not only at them, Jesus indicted each of us.

[time=154] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoffs. Thank you for joining us.
[time=159] Rick's message today is entitled "The Rejection Begins." John chapter 5 rings with all the excitement and drama of the courtroom.
[time=168] Here we find the intensity of lashing indictments, compelling speeches, and convincing evidence.
[time=175] Most of all, there is a surprising twist at the dramatic conclusion.
[time=179] Most startling, this real-life drama draws each of us into the courtroom, not as spectators, but as defendants.
[time=187] We invite you to carefully follow today's message from John 5. You are about to be incriminated.
[time=192] You will want to have your Bible so you can examine the evidence yourself.
[time=196] In fact, you may want to call your lawyer.
[time=199] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=204] Other special music includes a song from Susan Toyrat, an instrumental duet from Dave and Debbie Johnson, and a solo from Brian Losin.
[time=217] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=225] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=229] Now here's Rick.
[time=232] You are a worship service, and also to welcome our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=237] In this hour, we have set it apart to say that on the first day of the week, Christ rose from the grave, and He is worthy of our praise, and there's not anything more important to us than to worship Him.
[time=249] And so our choir leads us with a song singing praises to the great God that we serve.
[time=257] [MUSIC]
[time=262] Now sing, we joyfully unto God.
[time=265] We sing, we sing, so joyfully unto God.
[time=272] To God, so joyfully unto God.
[time=277] So joyfully unto God.
[time=281] [MUSIC]
[time=287] Now sing, we joyfully unto God.
[time=290] We sing, we sing, so joyfully unto God.
[time=297] To God, so joyfully unto God.
[time=307] [MUSIC]
[time=317] Now sing, we happily, happily, happily, happily, happily unto God.
[time=338] We sing to God.
[time=350] [MUSIC]
[time=355] Now sing, we joyfully unto God.
[time=358] We sing, we sing, so joyfully unto God.
[time=365] To God, so joyfully unto God.
[time=380] Now sing, we joyfully unto God.
[time=382] We sing, we sing, so joyfully unto God.
[time=389] To God, so joyfully unto God.
[time=394] So joyfully unto God.
[time=407] And we sing joyfully unto God because his amazing grace,
[time=414] how can it be that God would love me a sinner saved by grace?
[time=419] Him number 186, we'll sing the first, third, and fifth stands as a van, can it be 186?
[time=442] When can it be that God should gain when he enters in the same God's ground?
[time=458] Dye me for me who causes pain, for me to feel, to death pursue.
[time=475] Amazing love, how can it be that God would come to start for me?
[time=504] Dye for me.
[time=509] He led his father's throne above, so free, so invent his grace.
[time=525] And he didn't sell for all the love, and there for heaven's helplessness.
[time=541] It is mercy only in parents and free, for oh my God, it's not healthy.
[time=556] Amazing love, how can it be that God would come to start for me?
[time=574] No condemnation now I pray, Jesus stands holy in me in wisdom,
[time=590] all I've been here in my living care, and holy righteousness divine,
[time=606] all I have rose, he turned our throne, and we in the crown, in Christ my own.
[time=621] Amazing love, how can it be that God should start for me?
[time=651] Come thou almighty King, take a bar offering,
[time=665] Mr. Ween in you Lord, we proclaim you, and thou almighty King.
[time=676] Jesus we're gathered together, one church, one purpose, one need.
[time=686] We come to offer the praise that the saints sing forever, oh let it ring.
[time=696] Father we come here to meet you, mind us now as living stone.
[time=707] Come let your fire fill the temple again, we treat you, Lord be enthralled,
[time=716] what may you bear now, come thou almighty King, take a bar offering,
[time=730] Mr. Ween in you Lord, we proclaim you, and thou almighty King.
[time=746] Help us my name to see, show us for glory, we will cry holy,
[time=756] come thou almighty King, come thou almighty King,
[time=763] take a bar offering, come thou almighty King,
[time=772] come thou almighty King, come thou almighty King,
[time=796] take a bar offering, come thou almighty King,
[time=803] help us thy name to see, come thou almighty King,
[time=817] take a bar offering, come thou almighty King,
[time=831] come thou almighty King, help us thy name to see,
[time=843] show us for glory, we will cry holy, come thou almighty King,
[time=857] come thou almighty King, come thou almighty King,
[time=864] it's such a privilege for us to be able to share our morning worship services
[time=875] with you friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=879] Good morning, Pete, and I hope you're recovering from the flu and your cold.
[time=883] Well, I did have about what the flu this week, and it seems to be okay, and the cold is breaking up, so that's a good sign too.
[time=889] It's a good sign, but you can hear it just a little bit more.
[time=892] Over the past weeks, we've encouraged you to write to us, and it is so helpful to us to know that you're at the other end of all of this television equipment and enjoying the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=905] One friend wrote in just as we had asked and allow me to share his encouraging letter with you.
[time=911] It reads, "Not long ago, in September, as a matter of fact, I gave my life to Jesus, and I was baptized on December the 13th at a local church here in Goshen.
[time=923] It has been smooth sailing ever since, and I praise God for helping me to see the light.
[time=929] He opened my eyes and gave me a good look at just where I was headed, and he showed me that I was headed straight for hell, and I knew right then and there that it was time for me to do something with my life rather than just throwing it away.
[time=946] And then he says, "Please, underline three times, tell the people who watch the TV that there is still hope and that all they need to do is just let Christ take over their life.
[time=958] Please, don't wait until it's too late." Well, that's certainly encouraging for us to hear how one life was so dramatically changed by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=969] Perhaps Christ has come into your heart. We would love to know that.
[time=973] Or perhaps God has helped you through a tough time.
[time=976] That's such an encouragement to us to know how God has worked in your life and perhaps used this television ministry.
[time=983] So we do want to encourage you to write, and as you write, please let us know what station you do watch the Bible hour on.
[time=990] Pete, would you share our address?
[time=992] I would like to encourage you, too, to write to us.
[time=994] It's a great source of inspiration to us.
[time=997] When you write "Right to the Bible Hour," 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1006] Again, that's the Bible hour.
[time=1008] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1014] As you do write, we would love to hear from you, but we would also love to send you a helpful little pamphlet that we're making available this month.
[time=1023] Have you ever struggled saying, "I don't know where in the Bible "to find just the right verse or verses "to address a particular problem?" Maybe you're struggling in your own thinking, or you're trying to share Christ with another person, and they've raised some doubts or some questions, and you said, "I wish I could just reach into my pocket "and pull out something that would help me." Well, we have that something for you right now.
[time=1046] It's called a Vest Pocket Companion for Christian Workers.
[time=1050] The title Vest Pocket tells you that it's very small, but big in terms of its usefulness.
[time=1056] It'll fit right in your coat pocket or your vest pocket, and it can be a companion that you can carry with you and your purse or your coat, and it will give you a great index to helpful scriptural passages in dealing with doubt, discouragement, objections to why, or should I receive Christ?
[time=1074] We'd love to give you a copy of this booklet as well.
[time=1077] So if you would write and simply ask for the vest pocket companion, we'll send you your copy.
[time=1083] Once again, our address is, the Bible Hour box 7,400 East State,
[time=1091] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1095] That is the Bible Hour 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1104] Well, in a few weeks, we're going to have a very special, and I don't know what the right word to call it is.
[time=1109] I'll call it a concert with Hickson-Cohegan on April the 30th.
[time=1113] Usually one night out of the year, Rick, we have an unusually vent, and it's a dinner, as well as some comical drama combination of that, and Hickson-Cohegan do both.
[time=1125] They are very serious at times, and yet they can be just hilarious.
[time=1129] They've traveled many times with Bill and Gloria Gaither, and have started those programs for them, and they really do know how to combine humor with some serious impact as it relates to the Christian life, and that dinner theater concert is going to be April 30th.
[time=1148] Well, I remember just what you said, Pete, being at a Gaither concert in Hickson-Cohegan walked up onto the stage, and it looked very strange, and suddenly they took over, and it was obviously all planned in stage, but it was a time that I remember just joyfully laughing and enjoying life, and reminded of the Psalms, where it tells us about the joy in the Christian life, and humor and laughter can be great medicine, as the book of Proverbs tells us.
[time=1175] Well, this will be an evening to remember, an evening of inspiration, of music, of humor, of laughter, and of Christian joy, so save that date and give it to us one more time, please.
[time=1185] There'll be with us April 30th here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1190] So you'll want to save that date, and as is April Droll's closer, it will give you more information as to how you can get tickets.
[time=1198] Thank you again for joining us today here on the Bible Hour, and we'll look forward to opening up the scriptures and sharing out of the life of Christ from John chapter 5, an exciting passage that not only talks about the life of Christ, but it draws each one of us into the dramatic presentation of life.
[time=1224] [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=1375] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1381] Thank you, Dave and Debbie. That was beautiful.
[time=1383] In just a moment, we'll rise and recite our memory verse, but we'd like all of our visitors with us to join with us, so we've printed that verse on the inside of your bulletin.
[time=1391] If you'll turn there, if your visitor turn there, and we'll stay in now and recite our memory verse for the week, Joshua 1-8.
[time=1401] Joshua 1-8.
[time=1406] Do not let this book of the law depart out of your mouth.
[time=1411] Meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.
[time=1422] Joshua 1-8.
[time=1424] Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1428] John chapter 5
[time=1436] speaks with all the intensity and drama of a courtroom scene. It brings to us lashing accusation, indicting comments, compelling evidence, and a demand for a verdict.
[time=1455] But before the plot ends, the defendant will become the accuser, and the accusers will become the defendants.
[time=1465] But will there not only be that reversal?
[time=1468] Each of us will be drawn in to the courtroom ourselves.
[time=1473] Before this courtroom drama of John 5 comes to a final verdict, a new indictment will be issued against you and against me.
[time=1487] You may want to open your Bible to John chapter 5 so that you may study the evidence with us.
[time=1496] You may want to call your lawyer. You will need one.
[time=1501] I'd like to divide John chapter 5 into five separate categories.
[time=1507] The first one is an event, and it's found in John chapter 5 verses 1-9.
[time=1516] This one up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
[time=1520] Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheep gate
[time=1526] a pool which in Aramaic is called Bethsaida, and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
[time=1536] Here are a great number of disabled people used to lie.
[time=1540] The blind, the lame, the paralyzed.
[time=1546] One who was there had been an invalid for 38 years.
[time=1551] When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?" Sir, the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.
[time=1570] While I'm trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." Then Jesus said to him, "Get up, pick up your mat and walk."
[time=1582] At once the man was cured.
[time=1585] He picked up his mat and walked.
[time=1589] The day on which this took place was a Sabbath.
[time=1596] This chapter opens up with an event that's very typical of John's gospel and all of four of the gospels.
[time=1603] The event is a miraculous healing by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1608] We're told the timing is some time later.
[time=1613] John chapter 4, we studied it at length and it tells us of Jesus' dialogue with the woman at the well, miracles in Samaria, and then he moved back north to Galilee.
[time=1623] Now some time later he has moved back south to Jerusalem.
[time=1630] We don't know how much time, but his best Bible students can picture a significant amount of time has already transpired.
[time=1637] Maybe as much as a year.
[time=1641] As Jesus approaches the city, he's coming in to one of the particular gates,
[time=1647] a sata side, and there's a pool of water there.
[time=1651] Now the legend of that day was this, that an angel would come by occasionally
[time=1658] and stir the waters, making the waters have a healing potion.
[time=1663] And the first person to get into the water would be healed.
[time=1668] And so lots of people stayed around that pool.
[time=1672] This text says that there were those who were blind, those who were lame, and those who were paralyzed.
[time=1678] Jesus comes across this situation.
[time=1681] The Bible is in no way saying this was fact that an angel did trouble the waters or that somebody was healed.
[time=1687] It's just saying that's what people believed.
[time=1690] Jesus took advantage of the situation, he walks up and he meets a man who for 38 years has been paralyzed.
[time=1698] And he asks the man a question that is strikingly obvious, maybe even borderline offensive.
[time=1707] Jesus says to the man, "Hurious paralyzed, probably laying down flat on his mat."
[time=1714] And Jesus said to him, "Would you like to be well?" Isn't that obvious?
[time=1721] What man who has paralyzed would not like to be well?
[time=1727] It's more obvious the man is standing, no he's not standing, he's positioned by the pool hoping that he could be healed.
[time=1736] That may even be offensive.
[time=1739] I couldn't imagine saying to someone who's blind, do you really want to see?
[time=1743] Going into a hospital room of someone who has cancer and saying, "You sure you want to get better?" Or, "To this lame man, do you really want to walk?"
[time=1757] Perhaps Jesus asked the question because sometimes we get used to our infirmities
[time=1764] and we find ways of living around them, and we'd be more comfortable living with them than without him.
[time=1771] Maybe this was an individual Jesus said, "You're here, people are bringing you food, they're donating money, do you really want to get better?
[time=1778] Walk and carry all the responsibility for your life." You know, I can think at least in the terms of behavioral changes, this may be the most relevant question.
[time=1790] Do you really want to get better?
[time=1793] In talking with one of our counselors a number of years ago, he said that many people come into our counseling center, they unfold their problems and the counselor begins to prescribe them what they need to do in order to get better mentally, emotionally and spiritually, and the people basically say, "If it costs that much, not money, but in terms of changes in my life,
[time=1816] I think I'll stay sick." If it's going to take that much energy to heal my marriage, I'll let it fall apart.
[time=1824] If it's going to take that much effort on my part to overcome my depression, I think I'll go home and worry about it.
[time=1833] Maybe this is the most relevant question.
[time=1837] Do I really want to get better?
[time=1840] Sometimes we complain that no one is friendly to us at work or at school
[time=1846] or maybe at church.
[time=1848] It may be pointed out to us what we need to do to show ourselves friendly and we decide whether or not have any friends.
[time=1856] Jesus said, "Do you really want to get better?" This man answered in the infirmative and Jesus heals him with three simple commands.
[time=1866] Get up, pick up, and move out.
[time=1870] He says, "Get up, pick up your mat, and go forth." And the man did exactly what Jesus said.
[time=1878] Now John adds this final insight to the event, verse 9.
[time=1883] "At once the man was cured, he picked up his mat and walked," note this now.
[time=1890] "The day on which this took place was a Sabbath."
[time=1897] We are studying one of many Sabbath controversies.
[time=1903] This event led to some issues, and verses 10 through 15, the issues are presented to us.
[time=1911] So the Jew said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath.
[time=1916] The law forbids you to carry your mat." But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, "Pick up your mat and walk." So they asked him, "Who is this fellow?
[time=1933] Who told you to pick it up and walk?" The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
[time=1950] Later, Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again.
[time=1957] Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you." The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus that made him well.
[time=1969] This miraculous event, killing the paralytic man, brought two issues to the foreground, a minor issue and a major issue.
[time=1981] The minor issue was the controversy over the Sabbath.
[time=1985] This man is healed, he joyfully obeys Jesus, he picks up his mat, which is probably more like a stretcher.
[time=1992] We've been flooded with mash 407 shows in this television area and you can picture that's kind of the stretcher he probably had.
[time=2000] Jesus said, "Get up, pick up your stretcher." Isn't that paradoxical?
[time=2004] This stretcher that has carried you, you start carrying it and go.
[time=2009] And the man instantly did it and he probably didn't make it very many feet and a legalist came along.
[time=2015] There's usually one in every group.
[time=2017] And the legalist says to him, "This is the Sabbath." Our law strictly says you cannot carry a burden on the Sabbath.
[time=2029] Well the law never said you can't carry a burden on the Sabbath.
[time=2033] The law simply said honor the Sabbath.
[time=2036] But these legalists had made it their job to explain, interpret the law and give it definition.
[time=2042] And so these guys went so far as to say that if you had a deformity or an amputated leg, you could not lace up your peg leg on the Sabbath.
[time=2052] They also said it was unlawful for you to do the work of putting your false wood teeth in on the Sabbath.
[time=2060] That makes no sense to me at all.
[time=2062] It would take far more work to gum your food to death than it would be to put your teeth in and chew it.
[time=2068] But that's how legalistic these guys were.
[time=2071] And when they said you couldn't carry something, they meant you couldn't carry something.
[time=2075] One rabbi said it is unlawful for a man to open up his coat and insert a needle and carry it on the Sabbath.
[time=2084] And this guy is carrying a stretcher and immediately they grab him.
[time=2090] But that's really a minor issue.
[time=2093] This man pleads no contest.
[time=2096] He says I can pass this buck.
[time=2099] The man who held me, he told me to.
[time=2102] And notice the reaction to the legalist immediately.
[time=2105] They say who is this fellow?
[time=2108] The major issue is the battle for authority.
[time=2112] The major issue that's taking place here is these legalists want to know who is setting themselves up in competition with us.
[time=2121] Have you noticed the political atmosphere in New Hampshire?
[time=2128] The pollsters have been out and they announced that this guy is ahead so everybody picks on him.
[time=2133] Next time this guy is ahead and they turn the attention.
[time=2136] Newton gave a law of physics that said for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.
[time=2142] The same thing is true in social dynamics.
[time=2144] If this group of legalists are the most popular in revered and Jesus is over here and if his popularity starts to grow
[time=2154] then the opposite and equal reaction is their popularity is beginning to sink.
[time=2160] And they will know who is this guy?
[time=2163] Who's stepping on our turf?
[time=2166] Who's trying to call the shots?
[time=2168] We call the shots around here.
[time=2173] That was the issue not only the legalist.
[time=2175] That's the issue that each one of us face in coming to Christ.
[time=2180] Who's going to call the shots here?
[time=2183] I'd like to call my own shots and who is this fellow?
[time=2191] They finally identify Jesus and the issues change to indictments.
[time=2199] Verse 16, 17, and 18.
[time=2202] So because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath the Jews persecuted him.
[time=2210] Jesus said to them, "My father is always at work to this very day
[time=2216] and I too am working." For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him.
[time=2228] Not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was even calling God his father
[time=2235] making himself equal with God.
[time=2241] What was an issue is suddenly become a formal indictment.
[time=2248] They come face to face with Jesus and they confront him about doing notice it's these things plural on the Sabbath.
[time=2258] This was not the first nor will it be the last of the Sabbath controversies.
[time=2263] In Mark chapter 2, verse 23, Jesus disciples went through a field and they picked up some grain off the ground and the legalists said, "Aha, work." One of them rolled the grain in his hand to separate the wheat from the chaff and they said, "More work."
[time=2283] In Matthew chapter 3, or Mark chapter 3, a man with a shivered arm came up to Jesus in the temple on the Sabbath
[time=2291] and they all stared suspiciously wondering, "Will he heal him on the Sabbath?"
[time=2298] It's been a mounting issue and finally they've had enough and they are now persecuting him
[time=2306] because he violated their statutes about the Sabbath.
[time=2310] But that again is the minor indictment.
[time=2314] The major indictment follows.
[time=2317] In defense of his working on the Sabbath, Jesus makes this statement.
[time=2321] Verse 17, "My Father is always," notice that, "always working."
[time=2328] And to note this word, this day he is working.
[time=2333] The whole Jewish system of the Sabbath was predicated on one verse of the Bible, Exodus 2011, which says, "In six days the Lord God created the heavens of the earth and all that is in them
[time=2346] and on the seventh day he rested." And they have extrapolated from him resting on the seventh day a whole system of laws that had to be kept.
[time=2357] Jesus' point is this, "God did not stop working on the Sabbath." The only thing that God stopped doing on the Sabbath was creating.
[time=2368] God does work every Sabbath day.
[time=2372] God is omniscient and when you pray to him on the sixth day of the week, God doesn't say, "I hear that prayer and I know the answer and here it is." And if you pray on the seventh of Sabbath day, God doesn't send a memo and says, "Sorry, we're shut down."
[time=2388] God's omniscience continues to work on the Sabbath.
[time=2396] If God totally rested on the Sabbath, creation would have lasted six days.
[time=2401] Because it is God and God only that holds the world together.
[time=2406] And if he stopped working on one Sabbath, the world would dissolve and dissipate instantly.
[time=2412] So Jesus said, "God is always working." And then he stuck the knife in a little deeper and he said, "And he is working to this very day."
[time=2425] Right now, he's working and that was the Sabbath day.
[time=2429] Jesus was saying to them, face to face, "God is working today."
[time=2435] But he didn't say, "God is working." He said, "My Father is always working."
[time=2444] How they would have handled God is working.
[time=2446] I don't know, but it tells us how they handled, "My Father is working." It says, verse 18, "For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him."
[time=2457] Not only was he breaking the Sabbath, minor indictment, but major indictment.
[time=2462] He was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
[time=2470] The charge now changes from breaking the Sabbath to blasphemy.
[time=2477] This man, as far as they were concerned, this man was claiming total identification and equality with God.
[time=2486] By saying, "My Father works and hereto for I work."
[time=2493] Please take note of that in case you come under the teaching of many a false group, a cult,
[time=2499] who want to tell you that there's God and Jesus was the Son of God, but by Son it means he's kind of God.
[time=2507] Or he's a little God.
[time=2509] That doesn't fly biologically or theologically.
[time=2513] Theologically it's told us here.
[time=2515] They understood the title Son of God to be equal with God.
[time=2519] That's what the language meant, so don't let anybody interpret it differently.
[time=2523] But biologically, anything that is the Son of another thing is of the same order and substance.
[time=2531] You do not have to have an advanced degree in biology or zoology to know that if a mama cat gives birth,
[time=2539] it will not be to a goldfish.
[time=2542] It will be a cat. And the word son means to be of the same order and likeness.
[time=2550] Now you may look at your children and say, "I'm not sure they're totally human." But when you say you have a son, you're saying it's a human offspring just like me.
[time=2559] When Jesus said, "I'm the Son of God and he is my Father," he was claiming direct equality
[time=2565] because they were of the same order and substance.
[time=2569] Now they have two indictments, a major one and a minor.
[time=2575] The minor, the Sabbath, the major blasphemy, claiming equality with God.
[time=2581] Well, this is not a courtroom scene, but it's following that logic.
[time=2585] If there was a courtroom scene, the indictment, the charge would be read and the judge would say, "How do you answer, defendant?" And verse 19 begins with this phrase, "Jesus answered them." And verses 19 through 30, we find Jesus' answer.
[time=2603] I'll give them to you in six simple statements.
[time=2607] Jesus' answer number one is this, "I am one with God." Look at verses 19 and 20, Jesus gave them this answer.
[time=2617] I tell you the truth, the son, boy that irritated him as soon as he said that, can do nothing by himself, he can only do what he sees his Father doing
[time=2628] because whatever the Father does, the Son also does.
[time=2632] The Father loves the Son and shows him all he does.
[time=2635] Yes, to your amazement, he will show him even greater things than these.
[time=2641] Jesus said, "I'm vitally linked. I am one with God." The only things you see me do are the things I see the Father do.
[time=2648] He's going to say, "Wait a minute. What do you mean you've seen the Father?" What do you mean you're emulating him?
[time=2653] Jesus was claiming absolute identification with God.
[time=2657] Second statement Jesus made was, "I am the source of life." Verse 21, "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,
[time=2668] even so the Son gives life to those whom he is pleased to give it."
[time=2678] That is another claim to be God.
[time=2681] God is the only one who has the power to give life.
[time=2689] Jesus' statement says, "I have within my power the ability to give what only God can give."
[time=2699] And that is life.
[time=2702] Statement number three of Jesus.
[time=2704] Jesus said, "He is the ultimate judge. I am the ultimate judge." Verse 23, excuse me, verse 22, "Moreover the Father judges no one,
[time=2718] but has entrusted all judgment to the Son." The Bible makes it clear that the ultimate judge is God, and Jesus is claiming to be part of the Godhead because he says, "Father's not going to do the judgment. In this Godhead relationship of ours, I'll do the judging." Statement number four, he said, "He is the honored God." Verse 23, "That all honor, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father."
[time=2751] He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
[time=2758] Jesus' fourth statement is that all the honor that we would rightfully ascribe to God, we can rightfully ascribe to him. He is worthy of our honor.
[time=2768] Statement number five of Jesus is he says, "I am the author of salvation." Verse 24, "I tell you the truth. Whoever hears my word
[time=2779] and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, he has crossed over from death to life." It was pointed out to me long ago that in that verse there are three promises.
[time=2793] One is in the present tense, that if I receive Christ it says,
[time=2799] anyone who does that has eternal life. That's a present possession.
[time=2804] There's something that is future. In the future, any of us who receive Christ will not be condemned. And there's a blessing we have that's already been given past tense. We have already crossed over from death to life.
[time=2821] And Jesus said, "I'm the one that controls that. I'm God."
[time=2827] The sixth and final thing Jesus said is, "I have resurrection power."
[time=2833] The Book of Deuteronomy very clearly said that God has the power to kill
[time=2839] and to make alive.
[time=2842] Here's what Jesus said, verse 25, "I tell you the truth. A time is coming
[time=2850] and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
[time=2856] and those who hear will live.
[time=2860] For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself, and he has given him authority to judge man because he is the Son of man.
[time=2871] Do not be amazed at this. For a time is coming when all who are in the
[time=2877] graves will hear his voice and come out. Those who have done good will rise to life, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.
[time=2887] By myself, I can do nothing. I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just for I seek not to please myself, but him who sent me."
[time=2898] Jesus said, "Not only why be the judge, but I have the resurrection power." There will be a day when all speak, and anyone who is dead and who is not a believer will be judged.
[time=2911] Anyone who is alive and is a believer will be given eternal life, and I am the one who resurrects them.
[time=2918] Jesus could not have more clearly or dramatically answered their indictments.
[time=2923] The question was, "You are blaspheming. You are claiming to be God." Jesus did not say to his attorney, "Is there some bargain we can strike if I plead guilty to a loss or charge?" Jesus boldly and definitively says, "Yes, I am God. I am one with God.
[time=2944] I am the life-giving power of God.
[time=2946] I am the position judge of the universe as God.
[time=2949] I am the person who can receive the honor of God.
[time=2953] I am the one who can grant salvation as God, and I am the one who controls the resurrection.
[time=2959] I am God." And so this indictment is greeted with an answer and evidence.
[time=2969] In verses 31 through 40, Jesus gives the evidence to support his claims.
[time=2975] I love his honesty.
[time=2977] Look, first of all, verse 31, Jesus said, "If I testify about myself,
[time=2983] my testimony is not valid." Jesus is saying, "If all I do is claim to be God, and I have no other authority, no other documentation, no other witnesses, then that's not valid." Jesus would be like me saying to you, "I have an announcement to make.
[time=3002] I am the world's strongest man." Me saying that doesn't make it so.
[time=3010] Jesus saying, "I am Christ, didn't make it so. There has to be evidence.
[time=3015] If I said I'm the world's strongest man, you would ask for some evidence, and I'd have to very quickly admit I'm not the world's strongest man.
[time=3021] I'm only third." You may even want some evidence for that.
[time=3029] Third in my family, there's only two men.
[time=3032] Adam's ahead of me.
[time=3034] Jesus said, "I've got evidence for you, and he's going to cite four pieces of evidence."
[time=3040] Verse 32, "There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony
[time=3046] about me is valid.
[time=3048] You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
[time=3053] Not that I accept human testimony, but I mention it, that you may be saved."
[time=3059] John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.
[time=3067] I have testimony weightier than that of John.
[time=3070] For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, that which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me, and the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me.
[time=3084] You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.
[time=3093] You diligently study the Scriptures because you think by them you possess eternal life.
[time=3098] These are the Scriptures that testify about me.
[time=3102] Jesus gives four pieces of evidence.
[time=3105] Evidence number one is the testimony of God the Father.
[time=3109] He alludes to it twice.
[time=3110] Once he says, "There's one greater than I who testifies," and later he says, "The Father testifies." Well, when did God testify?
[time=3118] I believe Jesus is referring to his baptism.
[time=3122] When Jesus was baptized, as he came out of the water, Matthew 3 tells us, "Haven't opened up," and there was a voice from heaven, the voice of God who said, "This is my beloved son. Listen to him."
[time=3137] They had the testimony of God the Father.
[time=3141] So Jesus said, "It's not just me, but I have another witness, God." He gives a second testimony, and that is John the Baptist.
[time=3149] Now he points out, "I don't need human testimony, but Jesus said, 'I bring it up that you might be saved.'" Because you see, the majority of this audience really revered John.
[time=3163] And so Jesus alludes to John, but he quickly points out, "John was a light, and he spoke the truth, and you enjoyed his light," but he said, "for a time." Because following John the Baptist was not easy.
[time=3178] And although there was light, there was also heat.
[time=3181] And the heat was on, many of them turned away.
[time=3184] Chexwendall put it this way.
[time=3187] Like malls, flitting around a candle, they swarmed around John.
[time=3194] That is until they got too close to the flame.
[time=3198] Then one by one, they took flight.
[time=3202] The light, they light.
[time=3205] It was the heat that drove them away.
[time=3210] Jesus said, "You followed John.
[time=3213] If you really believed in John, what did John say?" John said when he saw Christ coming, "Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[time=3222] the sin of the world." So we got two testimonies.
[time=3228] God and John.
[time=3231] Third testimony, Jesus said, "The works that I do, they are a greater evidence."
[time=3238] By that he was referring to his miraculous power.
[time=3243] Exhibit A, the wedding at Canaan, he turned the water into wine.
[time=3248] Exhibit B, in the cities around Canaan, he did mighty miracles, say John chapter 2 verse 23.
[time=3256] Exhibit C, he had healed Peter's mother-in-law.
[time=3259] Exhibit D, he had calmed the sea.
[time=3262] Exhibit G, he had cast out demons.
[time=3265] Exhibit H, this paralyzed man of 38 years, is now walking right in front of their eyes.
[time=3275] Jesus said, "You unproof.
[time=3277] It's walking up to you." And the only response you could say, "You shouldn't do that on the Sabbath." Isn't it amazing how many times we fail to see the obvious and the important
[time=3291] because of a personal irritation and an issue.
[time=3296] These people failed to see the obvious that Jesus Christ was Lord because they were irritated that Jesus healed him on the Sabbath.
[time=3304] Beloved, don't let an irritation keep you from coming to Christ.
[time=3310] You may find that we don't do things right here or that somebody you saw on television did something you think that's really inappropriate or your neighbor who claims to be a believer and you heard the shouts coming from the house.
[time=3326] Hardly employee that you work with, who always has some religious tidbit to drop,
[time=3332] but he's not responsible on the job.
[time=3337] Don't let those issues keep you from the important thing of knowing that Jesus is Lord.
[time=3345] I'm sure that if you were to stand before him and he was to say, "How did you miss the fact that I loved you and I died for your sins?" And you said, "Fred was a lousy employee.
[time=3358] He won't be impressed." That's what these people were doing.
[time=3364] They let an issue blind them to the real identification of Christ.
[time=3370] The third evidence Jesus cited were the exhibits of His miraculous wonders and the fourth, the scriptures themselves.
[time=3380] These guys were the legal big ones.
[time=3382] I mean, they had a nose for detail.
[time=3384] They could sniff out any Old Testament text you needed.
[time=3389] But having searched them and studied them and plowed their way through them, once again they missed the point.
[time=3396] Jesus said, "You searched the scriptures for them, you think you have eternal life.
[time=3400] You're right to study the scriptures, but you missed the whole point." Jesus said, "These are what testify about me." You see in the Old Testament, there were over 300 prophecies about the Messiah and Jesus was systematically and orderly, fulfilling them one by one, one by one, and they missed them every time.
[time=3419] Jesus said, "You want proof that I'm the Messiah?" The scriptures say, "Messiah will be born in Bethlehem." The scriptures say, "Messiah will be visited by the Magi." The scriptures say, "Messiah will be born of a virgin." The scripture says, "Behold, the lame shall walk." Isaiah 35, 6 says, "Messiah will come and the lame will walk." The lame walk by and they say, "You can't say God's your father."
[time=3447] Jesus said, "You've searched the scriptures and you missed the whole point." The evidence is in.
[time=3455] Now, if you're like me and you grew up watching Perry Mason, Perry Mason not only got his defendant free, he always figured out who the guilty party was.
[time=3467] Jesus is the original Perry Mason.
[time=3472] Look at verse 40.
[time=3475] He's given his answer, he's given his evidence, and he says, "Yet you refuse to come to me.
[time=3481] I accept praise from men, but I know you.
[time=3484] I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts." Suddenly, the indictment has changed from Jesus to them, to be quite blunt to us.
[time=3496] Jesus said, "The issue is not with me and who I am, it's with you and who you are, and you really don't love God." Beloved, we need an attorney right now, and God said, "I love you so much, Jesus is your attorney."
