[time=90] In life adversity will come surprisingly, not only from those on the outside, but from those on the inside.
[time=118] Even our closest associates. Caesar pardoned two friends, Cassius and Brutus, for their disloyalty and siding with Pompey.
[time=129] But these two pardoned friends were the ones that orchestrated his death, and on the Ides of March in 44 BC, a gathering of friends surrounded Caesar, and they closed in and they stabbed him with over 20 blows.
[time=144] Caesar's dying words were at two, Brutae. Even you Brutus, in life, adversity will come, not only from our adversaries, but occasionally from our associates.
[time=159] This is a lesson that we learn from the life of Christ, one we need to learn for our own lives.
[time=167] (Music)
[time=178] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=184] Rick's message today is taken from the book of Matthew and is entitled His Antagonist. The Lord, like Julius Caesar, had two sets of antagonists. The first set were those who continually opposed and resisted him.
[time=199] The second set were his associates. These were the men who worked by his side, ate at his table, and slept under the same roof. Thomas doubted him. Peter denied him. Judas betrayed him.
[time=213] In today's study of the life of Christ, we examine the theme, a son, a savior, his antagonist. Our study will provide sound practical advice for each of us who would leave Christ today.
[time=227] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Matthew, chapter 16. We will be looking at verses 21 through 28.
[time=235] This sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song. Other special music includes a solo from Kevin Rowe and Lisa McNamara.
[time=249] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=257] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=263] Now here's Riff.
[time=265] We want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television. It's our purpose today to bring praise and glory and honor to the Lord.
[time=274] Many times in life, in a moment of frustration, we ask the question, "What's life all about?"
[time=280] You may remember back in the 60s, a popular song that said, "What's it all about, Alfie?" Or maybe in the 70s, you remember questions by Chicago, questions 67 and 68 on an album that said, "I've been searching so long to know the answer to the reason.
[time=296] Who am I?" And to know if my life has meaning. Perhaps you're not quite that philosophical today, but in your own heart you're saying, "What is it all about? What is life for?
[time=307] Are the striving and the struggling? Why am I here?" The Bible says it is our purpose that God has made us to bring praise and to glorify His name.
[time=318] And you and I will know the depth of fulfillment in life when we glorify Him.
[time=323] Our choir leads us in worshiping, praising, and glorifying God by singing a song entitled "Sing the Glory of His Name."
[time=353] We will rule by might forever, He keeps watch on all the lands.
[time=373] Bless the Lord with all your beak. Raise your voices, clap your hands.
[time=383] Shout, joyful lead to God. Sing the glory of His name. Shout His praises evermore.
[time=394] The alone will never change. Sing the glory. Sing the glory. Sing the glory of His name.
[time=415] Come and hear what God has done, healing body, mind, and soul through the working of His power, making us completely whole.
[time=429] Certainly He hears us pray. Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come. All the earth will worship you.
[time=440] Sing a praise of might He want. Shout, joyful lead to God. Sing the glory of His name. Shout His praises evermore.
[time=457] The alone will never change. Sing the glory. Sing the glory. Sing the glory of His name.
[time=474] Shout, joyful lead to God. Sing the glory of His name. Shout His praises evermore.
[time=484] The alone will never change. Sing the glory. Sing the glory. Sing the glory of His name.
[time=501] Shout, joyful lead to God. Sing the glory of His name. Shout His praises evermore.
[time=511] The alone will never change. Sing the glory. Sing the glory. Sing the glory of His.
[time=525] Sing the glory of His. Sing the glory of His name.
[time=546] We sing the glory of His name because Christ came down from glory to save us from our sins, so we recognize Him as our personal Savior, the only Savior of the world.
[time=557] Him number 63 will sing to the glory of His name all four stanzas of number 63.
[time=576] We sing the glory of His name all four stanzas of Christ.
[time=596] We sing the glory of His name, glory to His name, glory to His name, glory to His name, glory to His name.
[time=643] There till my heart was the part of my glory to His name.
[time=652] All precious ones and the saints from still.
[time=657] I am so glad I happen to turn in.
[time=661] There Jesus saves me in His evening, glory to His name, glory to His name.
[time=670] Glory to His name, glory to His name.
[time=679] There till my heart was the part of my glory to His name.
[time=689] Home to the sponged and the syringe and the sweet, as thy poor soul out of the Savior's feet.
[time=698] Blood and today are we made from death, glory to His name, glory to His name, glory to His name.
[time=716] There till my heart was the part of my glory to His name.
[time=727] Thank you for singing with us and again proclaiming the glory of Jesus name.
[time=732] Kevin Rowe comes now, talks to us about our commitment as a Christian to one another and the servant attitude that we should have.
[time=739] Let's listen to this message that's directly for us.
[time=744] Jesus knew the time had come for Him to go.
[time=769] He met with His disciples to let them know.
[time=777] Silence came to the room as He sat down to eat.
[time=784] Then Jesus knelt before them and began to wash their feet.
[time=798] Then He rose and asked them, "Do you understand?
[time=805] You call me Lord and Master, and that's who I am.
[time=813] I have also served you, that's why you believe.
[time=820] Now you must go into the world and give as you receive.
[time=830] Wash their feet.
[time=839] We are servant to the weak.
[time=846] Go invite the strangers in.
[time=850] What you do for them to the very same for me.
[time=861] Wash their feet.
[time=869] Jesus called it winning.
[time=879] Others called it lost.
[time=884] Bound to show His love no matter what the cost.
[time=891] Took the call of servant, though He was a king.
[time=899] And went and showed us how to live the way that we believe.
[time=908] Wash their feet.
[time=917] Be a servant to the weak.
[time=924] Go invite the strangers in.
[time=928] And what you do for them to the very same for me.
[time=938] We wash their feet.
[time=946] Be a servant to the weak.
[time=954] Go invite the strangers in.
[time=958] And what you do for them to the very same for me.
[time=968] Wash their feet.
[time=993] Again, we want to welcome you and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=999] In the next few weeks we're going to have some guests who are going to come and encourage us with music.
[time=1004] And we want to encourage you to come and join us here at Blackhawk for some of these events.
[time=1009] Rick, we have some friends down at Tennessee Temple University, Chattanooga, Tennessee.
[time=1013] The president is Dr. Don Jennings who's spoken here several times.
[time=1017] Yes he has.
[time=1018] And the director of the men's chorus happens to be a former student of mine.
[time=1021] His name is Tim Jeffers.
[time=1023] And Tim will be bringing the men's chorus here on March 13th.
[time=1027] That's a Sunday evening at 6 p.m. here at the Convocation Center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1032] The men's chorus number is about 25 young men.
[time=1035] They'll be exciting to hear and they'll minister to us.
[time=1038] And I'm excited to see Tim again and realize that the ministry goes on around the world as we work together for the cause of Christ.
[time=1045] Many of you have probably heard of Tennessee Temple before.
[time=1048] It is one of the premier Christian colleges here in the United States.
[time=1052] They have long been a sending school.
[time=1055] They have sent pastors into the field and missionaries overseas.
[time=1058] And it's really a great school.
[time=1061] And I hope some of you remember Don Jennings who's spoken here a number of times, a fine man of God.
[time=1066] We do want to encourage you to come then on March the 13th.
[time=1070] And then on April the 30th there's even a more exciting night to me because I know this young duo that's coming.
[time=1077] Well this is a once a year event that we have a dinner celebration along with a drama, comedy and a series with Hicks and Cohegan.
[time=1086] They often travel with Bill and Gloria Gaither and precede their concerts and just do a super job of zeroing in on many of the lifestyles of Christians and the problems that we have.
[time=1097] And kind of let us know that humor can play a very important part in realizing the problems that we have in life and that we can correct them through Jesus Christ.
[time=1107] You know I remember being a high school student.
[time=1110] I was invited to a number of what I would call religious activities. I now know that they were evangelistic meetings but those words didn't mean anything to me then.
[time=1119] And I remember that the seriousness and the soberness of those meetings and that was fine but the impression I had originally of Christianity is a bunch of people upset about something who didn't know how to laugh.
[time=1130] And we have so much to work on yes but we have so much to enjoy as well and this will be a night of enjoyment where humor is used with great taste and with a good point at the end of it.
[time=1142] And the date again is that's April 30th we'll be giving you more information as to the availability of tickets in just a couple of weeks and that's going to be a great time so if you have a calendar handy just to pencil in that date so that you can remember it and be with us on that evening.
[time=1159] Thank you Pete. Before we go back to the live portion of our morning worship service we do want to share a helpful little booklet with you.
[time=1167] It's something I've enjoyed looking at over the past few weeks it's called a vest pocket companion.
[time=1173] Perhaps you've been in this situation where somebody has posed a question at you or brought a problem to your attention from their spiritual life and you wished that you could quickly turn to the right passages of scripture to help them.
[time=1187] But you didn't quite have it up the top of your head or on the tip of your tongue and you needed a little help.
[time=1193] This booklet is put together to help us with a thorough index of spiritual problems from doubt to discouragement from objections to Christianity to those who don't want to come to Christ and they've got all kinds of excuses.
[time=1207] This little booklet will be a great help to you. Ladies you could carry it in your purse. We could carry it very comfortably inside our coat pocket.
[time=1215] We'd love to send you a copy as a way of strengthening your spiritual walk. If you'll simply write to us today we'll send you a copy free and postage paid.
[time=1224] You can receive this helpful pamphlet by writing to the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1235] Once again that's the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1244] Thank you Pete and thank you for joining us today. I'm looking forward to opening up the scriptures and sharing another message from the life of Christ.
[time=1252] One that I hope will be as helpful to you as the study has been to me.
[time=1256] In life we will have those who are adversaries but occasionally difficulty will come not only from them but from our associates, from some of the people closest to us.
[time=1266] Today as we study the life of Christ we'll see that that was true of his situation and he gives us some great insight and dealing with that problem.
[time=1275] Thanks for being a part of the Bible hour today.
[time=1282] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=1475] Let's stand as we prepare to recite God's Word.
[time=1479] If you're visiting with us we'd like to ask you to join us as well.
[time=1483] The memory verse is found in the inside of your bulletin on the top right hand corner.
[time=1488] 2 Timothy 2 15, do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles God's Word of Truth. Thank you.
[time=1518] [MUSIC - 17 seconds]
[time=1563] God and God alone reveals the truth and all we call are known. And all the best and worst of men won't change the master's plan, it's God's and God's alone.
[time=1592] God and God alone is fit to take the universe's throne.
[time=1610] Let everything that lives reserve its truest praise for God and God alone.
[time=1631] God and God alone will be the joy of our eternal hope.
[time=1646] He will be our one desire, our hearts will never tire of God and God alone.
[time=1662] God and God alone is fit to take the universe's throne.
[time=1677] Let everything that lives reserve its truest praise for God and God alone.
[time=1694] God and God alone is fit to take the universe's throne.
[time=1709] Let everything that lives reserve its truest praise for God and God.
[time=1753] [MUSIC]
[time=1761] Thank you, Brian. Would you bow with me in prayer? For God and God alone, it is you, O Lord, that we come to worship today.
[time=1773] And we must confess to you that during this past week we have worshiped many a false God.
[time=1781] Father, we are guilty that we have worshiped possessions, relationships, security, success, too many false gods.
[time=1796] And we come today to not only confess but to ask your forgiveness and pledge anew to you today that in our hearts you are God and God alone.
[time=1807] And we come today to give to you not only the praise of our lips or a gift in an offering plate, but God we come to give to you our very lives.
[time=1816] As living sacrifices, we belong to you, to God and to God alone. And as we worship you today, we ask that your spirit would be with us giving us an attitude of praise that we might worship you in spirit and in truth.
[time=1834] Father, today as we come before you, we would cry out like David. May the words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts be acceptable in your sight.
[time=1846] God, it is joy that brings us here. It is love that causes us to return. We do love you and we find joy in being in your house with your people.
[time=1860] And we pray for your people today. For Judy Nussbaum and for Dick Rowe as they recover from surgical procedures.
[time=1869] We pray today for Marv Deggitz that you would give strength to him. And we pray today for Bill Adler that you would give recovery to his body and to his heart.
[time=1881] Father, today we pray for broken lives that they might find the touch of the master's hand that you would make them new and fresh.
[time=1892] We pray for those who are discouraged. Others who are beyond that and who are depressed for reasons that they may not even understand.
[time=1902] May they find that in God and God alone, there is healing today. We ask you today through your word to speak to us, particularly for those who are here, whom we love, but have not yet given their hearts to Christ.
[time=1919] We ask you to speak to them. And then to us who know Christ that we might walk in obedience, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1932] If you have your Bible, please open it to Matthew chapter 16. And while you're finding Matthew's gospel, allow me to set the stage of what we've been studying here at Blackhawk.
[time=1946] Since the Christmas season and throughout this winter and spring, we are studying the life of Christ.
[time=1955] And as we've studied the life of Christ, we have come to a point, a pinnacle in Christ's ministry where his acceptance is almost universally being received.
[time=1967] Jesus has gone from Galilee south to Judea and back and forth several times. And as he has gone, he has provided supernatural miracles.
[time=1978] One man was blind congenitally. He was not able to see Jesus healed him and his eyes were restored fully.
[time=1987] Another individual was lame. He could not walk. Jesus healed him. And he leaped up and walked away.
[time=1994] Another individual had the inability to hear. Everyone else could hear, but he could not. And Jesus would touch him and his ears would open.
[time=2005] Jesus was being accepted broadly because of the miraculous signs that he had done.
[time=2013] In fact, people were literally gathering by the thousands just to hear him teach and to see what he might do next.
[time=2022] On one occasion, at least 4,000 were gathered and Jesus miraculously took a simple lunch, multiplied it and fed the 4,000.
[time=2031] On another occasion, he duplicated the miracle, this time feeding 5,000. His acceptance was powerful.
[time=2042] But while on the broad scene, Jesus was being so greatly accepted underneath all that, there was a current of rejection.
[time=2050] That had always been there and it was slowly growing and growing.
[time=2055] We saw last week in the study that Jesus' rejection began by a group of people. The Bible referred to as Pharisees.
[time=2064] They even were at the point by John chapter 5 where they wanted to take his life.
[time=2070] Matthew chapter 16 is a pivotal point in Jesus' life.
[time=2077] It's where acceptance begins to fade and rejection mounts.
[time=2084] Matthew 16 verses 21 through 23.
[time=2092] From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders.
[time=2105] The elders, chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
[time=2118] Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
[time=2124] "Never, Lord," he said, "this shall never happen to you." Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get out of my sight, Satan.
[time=2142] You are a stumbling block to me. You do not have in mind the things of God but the things of men."
[time=2153] Into every life and into every plan will come the antagonists.
[time=2161] But surprising, they will not only come from the field of our adversaries, antagonism will occasionally come through the field of our associates.
[time=2175] Julius Caesar had been conqueror. He had marched into Gaul and he had conquered the enemies of Rome.
[time=2182] He had turned his forces south and he had stopped Hannibal the Carthaginian.
[time=2187] He was a national hero and more than any other person he brought Rome to the pinnacle of world power.
[time=2195] Along his way he faced his adversaries well. And by his sides there were associates, men like Cato and Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus, but there came a time in his life when these associates, Cassius and Brutus, turned against him and they sided with his rival,
[time=2220] Pompey and a war actually ensued and Caesar overcame Pompey.
[time=2227] And out of his magnanimous heart Julius Caesar pardoned Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus.
[time=2235] They were his associates. They were by his side.
[time=2240] Caesar's power begins to grow to the point where they offer him even to be king but he rejects it.
[time=2247] In his adversaries and his associates meet in the halls of the senate.
[time=2255] And out of their meeting comes a plan. And on March the 15th, the Ides of March of 44 BC, as Caesar would leave the senate, his associates, not his adversaries, his associates surrounded him.
[time=2270] And they walked by a side and then they squeezed in and they crushed his body and when they moved apart, Caesar's body fell to the ground dead from 20 stab wounds.
[time=2285] And his dying words were et tu, Brutae, even you, Brutus, even you, Brutus, my associate, even you, Brutus, who I have pardoned, et tu, Brutae.
[time=2310] The antagonist will not always be that face to face adversary.
[time=2316] Often it comes from the closest of associates.
[time=2322] Here in Matthew chapter 16 we see that antagonism came at Jesus from two sources. His adversaries, the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law.
[time=2336] And even his associates, Peter to name one. Look at the text please.
[time=2343] It says from this time on Jesus began to explain.
[time=2348] It's always good to know your time frame, your reference point.
[time=2352] This time Matthew tells us from this time on Jesus began. Two observations.
[time=2359] First of all, let's set this in time.
[time=2363] What has happened is Jesus' success has been mounting. It's in Matthew chapter 15 verse 29 that he feeds the 4,000.
[time=2372] Popularity is like a wave at a football game. They're cheering him on.
[time=2379] Now Jesus retreats from the crowd and he says to his disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2385] And Peter says, "You're the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[time=2391] And Jesus said, "Yes. You're right, Peter. And you're a rock-like man. And out of rock-like men such as you, I'm going to build my church.
[time=2401] And nothing's going to stop it. Anything that can come out of the gate of hell itself cannot stop my church."
[time=2408] And Peter, I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom.
[time=2414] You talk about a pep talk. I mean here are thousands of people around him and Jesus pulls these guys aside and says,
[time=2421] "We're going to build the church. And here are the keys to the kingdom. It's going to happen."
[time=2429] Now it's from that time on Jesus began. He initiates a new concept.
[time=2438] Second observation is that which Jesus taught. He taught about a suffering Messiah.
[time=2444] It says that Jesus taught them that he would come to Jerusalem and that he would suffer and that he would be killed.
[time=2452] They had never once contemplated that.
[time=2456] Never once in Peter's Vegas thoughts did he ever think of Jesus dying.
[time=2464] And Jesus had never hinted at it. He's now beginning to teach this.
[time=2471] And Jesus identifies the first group of antagonists, his adversaries.
[time=2476] He uses three terms. They are elders, chief priests and teachers of the law.
[time=2482] Allow me to explain the list by giving you six terms because some of them are inclusive.
[time=2489] Six different terms you'll hear from the scriptures of people who often stood in Jesus' way as his antagonist.
[time=2498] One are those who are called scribes. Here they are called teachers of the law.
[time=2504] A scribe was called a scribe because he scribed. The word scribe scripto means to write and a scribe was somebody who marked.
[time=2513] The scribe's job was to take a pin in parchment and to say Isaiah 714, behold.
[time=2522] And he would write behold. A virgin. He would write a law. He would conceive and write it out.
[time=2528] His job was to actually, we would say transcribe, make copies of the Old Testament.
[time=2536] And as such, they were men very concerned about the law and they were the chief teachers and interpreters of the law.
[time=2546] There's a second group of people called Pharisees. And the teachers of the law were occasionally Pharisees.
[time=2553] Allow this crude analogy. A Pharisee was like a denomination within the broader circle of Judaism.
[time=2561] The Pharisees were very much concerned about the law, but they were even more concerned about oral tradition.
[time=2568] For example, the law said, "Thou shalt honor the Sabbath and keep it holy." That was written down in Exodus 20.
[time=2577] But the Pharisees were very concerned about the oral tradition. What did Rabbi Yekah Shizomir say about that in 1000 BC?
[time=2586] And they kept not only details of the written law, but the Pharisees kept details of the oral law.
[time=2594] There were a third group called the Sad UCs. They would be like a different denomination, very much rival to the Pharisees.
[time=2603] The Sad UCs did not care about the oral tradition, only the written law.
[time=2609] They were in some ways very conservative because they discounted the oral tradition and held to the written tradition.
[time=2615] They were very concerned about the sacrificial system and the temple.
[time=2620] But in other ways, they were the liberals of the day.
[time=2623] They viewed God as somewhat of a deastic concept that God created the world and then stepped back and he never interfered.
[time=2629] They did not believe in angels, or a human spirit, or life after death.
[time=2635] There was a third group called Herodians. They took their name because they were loyal to Herod.
[time=2641] They were not a religious group, but a political entity.
[time=2645] It was somewhat of a generic term that included all the people who had more or less compromised to join hands with Herod and the Romans.
[time=2656] The fifth term is used here. It's the most generic term of all. It's the term elder.
[time=2661] The Hebrew word actually means the bearded one.
[time=2665] Hence, I will never probably be able to be an elder in my life.
[time=2669] When I was 24 and dating Kathy, I grew a mustache for a month.
[time=2674] I shaved it off and the before, during and after showed no difference. She never observed it.
[time=2680] But an elder was a bearded one.
[time=2683] So some of you today are a little bit more of an elder than the rest of us.
[time=2688] But it really referred to someone who was older and it meant somebody who was the head of a family or in Israel the head of a clan or even bigger the head of a tribe. It was somewhat of a generic term.
[time=2700] If you'll pardon the expression for the good old boys that sat down by the gate and talk things over.
[time=2707] The final term is the term chief priests. Notice that it's plural here.
[time=2712] There was only meant to be one chief priest by the days of Herod. Herod had taken over the priest to it and he was appointing who the priest would be.
[time=2720] It was largely a matter of nepotism and money. Whoever was the most loyal to Herod, whatever families were in power, they became the chief priest.
[time=2729] The word is used not only to describe the one man but the whole entourage.
[time=2734] For example, we'll turn on the news and somebody like Peter Jennings may say, this news release came from the White House today. The White House says, do you ever see a White House talk? Do you ever see a brick house talk? Do you ever see any kind of house talk?
[time=2750] That's an expression that means the people who are represented by the White House.
[time=2756] It may mean the president, it may mean the chief of staff, it may be the press secretary.
[time=2761] It just meant somebody who represented the White House.
[time=2765] When it says chief priests, it may mean the chief priest, the ex chief priest, and the family of the chief priest, the captain of the guards, of the temple guards.
[time=2775] But these are the groups.
[time=2778] When you look back here at Matthew 21, it says, many things at the hands of the elders.
[time=2783] The elders would include all the people who were leaders in the community.
[time=2788] Secular Herodians are religious, Pharisees and Sadducees.
[time=2794] The terms chief priests would refer to that office and all of the people who had authority over the temple.
[time=2802] And finally, teachers of the law would be the scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees.
[time=2808] Now, it's impossible for us to understate the antagonism between these people and Jesus.
[time=2816] I want to give you a whirlwind tour through the book of Matthew.
[time=2819] So if you have Matthew open, turn to Matthew chapter 3.
[time=2823] And we see the antagonism beginning in Matthew 3.
[time=2828] Now these are not the words of Jesus, these are the words of John.
[time=2832] But John and Jesus are vitally linked in two ways.
[time=2836] One, they're cousins.
[time=2838] Two, Jesus and John more or less have a ministry merger.
[time=2846] John announces Christ coming, Christ takes the forward ground and John's disciples follow the Lord Jesus.
[time=2853] Now in John's account of the Pharisees is pretty pointed.
[time=2859] Matthew chapter 3 verse 7.
[time=2862] When he, John the baptizer, saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to them where he was baptizing, he said to them,
[time=2871] "Good morning, how are you fine gentlemen today?" Your text read a little different than that.
[time=2879] Mine doesn't have the good morning, it says, "You brood of vipers." Now let's not get caught up in the formal language.
[time=2887] You know what he's saying?
[time=2888] Well, you snake in the grass.
[time=2890] What are you doing showing up here?
[time=2893] That's really how to get a relationship started off on the wrong foot.
[time=2898] And that's how Jesus' relationship with these Pharisees and Sadducees began.
[time=2905] Turn to chapter 9 verse 3.
[time=2909] Chapter 9 has primarily as its theme, Jesus' authority and the leader's rejection.
[time=2918] Chapter 9 verse 3, Jesus says to a man your sins are forgiven.
[time=2923] At this time, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming."
[time=2930] Now they didn't say, "Excuse me, Jesus, but in our culture and our society, we prefer a different phraseology."
[time=2936] And we would like to suggest that you say, "Uh-uh." They immediately accused him of a capital crime.
[time=2943] If you were accused of blasphemy, Gary, if you were accused of blasphemy and this was that culture,
[time=2950] you'd be drug out back and if two witnesses would identify, the rest of us would stone you to death now.
[time=2956] I mean, these guys weren't pulling any punches.
[time=2962] Chapter 9 verse 10 and 11.
[time=2966] While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
[time=2973] When the Pharisees saw this, they said, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
[time=2983] Their hostility moves not only at Jesus for what he says, but with those he associates with.
[time=2990] They're angry about that.
[time=2992] Chapter 9 verse 34, it comes to a temporary climax.
[time=2997] Jesus casts out a demon in the Pharisees, say, in verse 34.
[time=3001] It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.
[time=3006] Do you understand what they were saying there?
[time=3008] They recognized Jesus cast out a demon and they said for him to have power over that demon, it's because he Christ was possessed of Satan, the prince of demons.
[time=3018] That's the only way he could cast out that demon.
[time=3023] The antagonism builds and it builds.
[time=3026] You come to chapter 12 and verse 2.
[time=3033] At that time, Jesus went throughout the grain fields on the Sabbath.
[time=3036] His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
[time=3041] When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
[time=3049] This is one of many Sabbath controversies.
[time=3052] Verse 14 tells us how heated the exchange was.
[time=3058] But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill him.
[time=3065] Chapter 15, boy, they really catch Jesus in a terrible situation.
[time=3071] Chapter 15 verse 2, "Why do your disciples break your tradition of the elders?
[time=3078] Why don't they wash their hands before they eat?" I mean, you can tell things are really serious now.
[time=3083] They've got Jesus' disciples not washing their hands.
[time=3087] That's how intense the hostility became.
[time=3089] These guys were following Jesus trying to find anything and everything they could pick out.
[time=3096] To use our free geology, Jesus has had it.
[time=3100] Look at chapter 15 verse 7.
[time=3104] Jesus finally looks at them and he says, "Why you hypocrites."
[time=3111] Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you.
[time=3115] Wouldn't that put you on the spot?
[time=3117] I mean, here are 2,000 years worth of prophetic statements about humanity.
[time=3123] And this guy suddenly decides to apply them to you personally.
[time=3128] These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
[time=3132] They worship me in vain.
[time=3133] Their teachers are but rules taught by men.
[time=3139] Jesus called them face to face hypocrites.
[time=3144] For the humor of it, look at verse 12.
[time=3148] The exchange is over, and then the disciples come to Jesus and ask, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?" I don't think Jesus was really preoccupied whether the Pharisees found it easy to swallow or not.
[time=3165] Well, as you come to chapter 16, the good news is that it's bad.
[time=3172] And the bad news is, from chapter 16 on, it gets worse.
[time=3177] Allow me just to point out one more exchange after this event.
[time=3182] It's Matthew chapter 23.
[time=3185] In Matthew chapter 23, Jesus is now not talking just with the Pharisees about themselves.
[time=3192] He's not talking with a small group of his disciples.
[time=3196] It says, verse 1, "Then Jesus said to the crowds and his disciples."
[time=3205] In verse 3, he accuses them of not practicing what they preach.
[time=3211] In verse 13, he gives it a word again.
[time=3214] He says, "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites."
[time=3222] In verse 16, he calls them blind guides, meaning they had no spiritual insight of their own at all.
[time=3232] In verse 27, he really gets graphic.
[time=3235] "Woe to you, teachers of the law, Pharisees, you hypocrites, you are like white washed tombs,
[time=3243] which look beautiful on the outside, but on the inside are full of dead man's bones and everything unclean."
[time=3253] And then in verse 33, he borrows a chapter out of cousin John's book.
[time=3260] "You snakes, you brood of vipers."
[time=3266] The antagonism between Jesus and the religious establishment of the day
[time=3272] came to the point where they, yes, did actually orchestrate and implement Jesus' death.
[time=3282] But that wasn't surprising.
[time=3285] The surprise came in verse 22 of Matthew 16 when Jesus is confronted by Peter.
[time=3294] Jesus said three things. I'm going to go to Jerusalem, one and suffer, two and be killed, three be raised back to life.
[time=3303] But like many of us, Peter stops listening halfway through it.
[time=3307] He didn't catch be raised back to life. He only caught suffer and be killed.
[time=3314] And Peter instantly and verbally objects. John MacArthur calls Peter the apostle with the foot-shaped mouth.
[time=3325] And he on this occasion, as many others, opened it and inserted one big foot.
[time=3334] And imagine face to face with the Lord. He basically turned and said, "Lord Jesus, you're wrong!"
[time=3340] And I personally won't let it happen.
[time=3345] Wow.
[time=3348] But let's give Peter a little benefit of the doubt.
[time=3351] Do you know that Jesus preached the kingdom of God? Is it hand?
[time=3355] You know, Jesus taught them to pray, "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come."
[time=3361] You know, Jesus went out and preached the kingdom is coming.
[time=3364] Jesus told them in Matthew chapter 10, "Go and preach the kingdom is coming." And right here in Matthew chapter 16, if you look down to verse 19, Jesus said to Peter,
[time=3376] "I will give you the keys of the kingdom." I wonder Peter expected there to be a kingdom.
[time=3384] But Christ is now beginning to teach them a temporary delay in the implementation of the kingdom.
[time=3393] Peter's abruptness gets him a very, very stern rebuke. Two things.
[time=3400] One Jesus is so indignant what he says. He says, "King James, get thee behind me. I like the international.
[time=3407] Get out of my sight! Can't stand to look at you!"
[time=3413] And then he gives him the pseudonym Satan.
[time=3418] He wasn't saying necessarily that Peter was filled by Satan, but he was saying that is the plan of Satan that you're advancing.
[time=3427] And you are now not associating with me, but associating with Satan, and you're now my antagonist.
[time=3433] You're a stumbling block. You're keeping me from being what I ought to be and doing what I must do.
[time=3439] You're a stumbling block. And get out of my sight. Get out of the way.
[time=3448] Two practical lessons to draw from this. One is expect in life.
[time=3456] An antagonism to come not only from your adversaries, but occasionally from your associates.
[time=3463] Two. Exempt yourself from the list of being an antagonist.
[time=3469] Words like loyalty and dependability, faithfulness and trust are so important that when we say we'll stand by one side, we will stand by one side.
[time=3483] When we promise that our word is true and that our word is sure, that we will not become in the life of the Lord Jesus of Peter, or in the life of a friend, a Brutus.
[time=3500] Don't let it be said of you. And to, Brutane.
[time=3513] What a pleasure it's been to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, Lisa McNamara, Kevin Rowe and Brian Losen.
[time=3521] And then the ministry from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
