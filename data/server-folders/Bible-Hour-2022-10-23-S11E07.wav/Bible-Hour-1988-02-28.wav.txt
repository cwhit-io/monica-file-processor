[time=90] In addressing the issue of our personal finances, many times we fall victim to one of the four myths about money.
[time=106] The first of these is that managing my money would be easier if I just had more.
[time=113] (music playing)
[time=123] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. Thank you for joining us.
[time=128] Jesus on Money is the title of Rick's Message Today.
[time=132] From the Sermon on the Mountain Matthew 6, we will draw four basic principles about money.
[time=138] These principles are both timeless and tested. Managing financial resources is a universal problem.
[time=145] Most people struggle with it regardless of their income level.
[time=149] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Matthew chapter 6.
[time=154] We will be looking at verses 19 through 34.
[time=158] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=163] Other special music includes a number from the Handel Choir and a solo from Denise Mitchell.
[time=171] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen in this station each week at this time.
[time=180] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you. Now?
[time=190] It's my privilege to welcome you and to thank you for joining us for our second morning worship service here at Black Hawk.
[time=198] I hope in your heart there is a preparation that says I have come today to worship the Lord.
[time=204] We often talk about what is it that we get out of worship and I for one certainly hope you get something out of this hour today.
[time=212] But most of all we hope that you've come to give something and that is your devotion and your praise to our God and our Father.
[time=219] Welcome to our service today.
[time=221] We also want to greet our friends who join us for the Bible Hour and trust that God will use this time together in your life.
[time=229] In the book of Revelation it tells us there is a coming day when Jesus Christ will be enthroned in glory.
[time=235] He will rule over heaven and earth complete and at that time he will wipe away every tear from our eyes.
[time=244] And there will be no more death, no more pain, no more sorrow.
[time=249] That's future but it is our hope and the song of which our choir sings this morning.
[time=274] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.
[time=288] And there was no more sea, no more sea, no more sea.
[time=348] We hold the temple of all His name.
[time=357] And He will dwell within and He shall be His day gone.
[time=364] And God Himself shall be there then and be there gone.
[time=377] [MUSIC - 43 seconds]
[time=446] There shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more crying, no pain, no pain, no pain, no sorrow, no pain.
[time=473] For God Himself shall be there then and be there gone.
[time=491] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=526] I look forward to that day. Till that time, however, we continue to lean on the arm of Jesus as He leads us through this earth.
[time=533] All the way My Savior leads Me, Him number 407. We'll sing all three verses together, Him number 407.
[time=541] [MUSIC - 139 seconds]
[time=695] Thank you for singing together. Let's listen together now as the handbell choir plays for us. Joyful, joyful, we adore thee.
[time=705] [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=795] [APPLAUSE]
[time=802] Let's stand please as we recite our memory verse for this week. If you're visiting with us, that memory verse is found in the lower left-hand corner of your bolt and we moved it just to surprise you today.
[time=813] So in case you were used to taking a quick look at the top right, it's not there. But if you're visiting, please find it in the lower left-hand inside of your bolt. Proverbs 15-1.
[time=823] [MUSIC]
[time=835] Each week we encourage you to write to us here at the Bible Hour. Your letters mean so much to us by way of support and enthusiasm. And Pete, I wanted to share one of those letters with you and with our friends today. It begins to the Bible Hour. Please send me the free books called The Vest Pocket Companion for Christian Workers and Your Decision. I watch the Bible Hour at Black Hawk Baptist Church and love to hear God's name.
[time=864] And love to hear God's word. We get the Bible Hour on Channel 46 at 5 p.m. on Sunday evenings. I have just this last Sunday become a born again Christian. Praise the Lord. Thank you. Well, that certainly is an encouragement, isn't it?
[time=881] It really is, Rick. Sitting here in the auditorium and praying as earnestly as we can, that prayer of commitment to Jesus Christ, one wonders if anybody is listening. And at times, it certainly is rewarding to know that somebody has truly committed their lives to Christ.
[time=896] If you've made that decision, could we ask you to do exactly what this friend has done and take just a brief moment to write us a short letter to know that you've made that decision to open up your heart to Christ? And as this friend did, we want to encourage you to request some of the literature that we have that is so helpful. At the end of the broadcast, Pete will share with you how you can receive a copy of the pamphlet, Your Decision.
[time=921] But right now, I'd like to tell you about a booklet called The Vest Pocket Companion. It's an outline book that will help to answer some of your basic questions about the Christian life and what it means to know Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=935] And then it will go beyond helping you. It'll be a resource tool that you can use as a Christian worker to share Christ with other people. It's free. It's a tool that we want you to have and it comes as a gift from us to you for simply requesting it.
[time=950] You request the book today right to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, right to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=970] During this past week, our television crew have been busy videotaping some of the progress on our new sanctuary. And we've put some of that tape together to share with you. And we hope that it will be as much of an encouragement to you as it is to us.
[time=985] Rick, just last Friday afternoon, Ed Richard, our sound coordinator and television coordinator, went out to the new building. And we had a chance to give you just the latest update just before the fellows quit for the weekend and some of the progress of our new building.
[time=1002] This is the steel scaffolding that they're bringing in now because they're going to be putting in the fireproofing and the heating ducts and the actual finished ceiling of our sanctuary in the next three or four weeks.
[time=1014] And looking now at the planking that the men will use to put on that steel scaffolding, it's quite a project to cover the entire floor of the worship center so that they can reach some nearly 40 feet in the air to our ceiling.
[time=1029] That's the balcony area that's just about completed now with its pouring of the cement. And that's the back area of the choir room. We're excited that they're going to pour the floor this week and begin to finish up with studying and dividing up that large area into offices as well as a choir room.
[time=1048] Sheet metal men have been in there for quite a long time. These are large heating ducts that go underneath the balcony so that we can be comfortable in the wintertime and they'll also be air conditioning for us in the summer.
[time=1060] This is the side view on the east side looking from the platform to the balcony area. There will be more steps than that right now. It's kind of precarious to get up there but that's the entrance to the side of our balcony with on the right hand side will be a large room.
[time=1077] Tom Votal works in there every day on the electrical. It's quite a complicated affair to get all the wiring in order and he is just one of the fine workers that we have in the building.
[time=1088] This is looking toward the west now as you get a view from the platform area looking across as you would be looking out at the congregation, the lower level and then the balcony there in the white cemented area.
[time=1103] This individual that you see gesturing with his hand in the brown jacket is Mr. Dale Harder and we are very sad to share with you today that last week on Wednesday Dale suffered a major heart attack while working on the building here and he died a few moments later at Parkview Hospital.
[time=1121] We want to extend our sympathy to all of Dale's family and friends and of course even to us here at Blackhawk we have grown to love Dale and appreciate him and we are only encouraged to share with you that Dale did know Jesus Christ is his Savior and we know today that he is in heaven with the Lord.
[time=1139] And we share this broadcast to the Bible Hour with you today in memory of our friend Dale Harder.
[time=1169] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1225] God we are thankful for your character today. Even as Denise would prepare a song that would speak of your faithfulness. I am thankful today. God know that you are faithful.
[time=1235] That you care about me whether I do things right or I make a mistake. You love me. God I sense that love even today. Thank you for caring about us.
[time=1245] We come to you to give you our worship today and yet Father we feel inadequate because we know our own shortcomings and our own sinfulness but we love you Lord and we have come to praise you.
[time=1258] Some of us have come to praise you because we have a gift of music and we can ring a bell.
[time=1263] Others of us have not that gift but our hearts ring forth. We praise you Lord Jesus. We also come today to ask for you for your grace and your peace and your strength.
[time=1276] And God we would pray this morning for those who are walking through deep valleys. We pray for Eleanor Lehman as she battles with cancer and for her and her husband that you would comfort their hearts.
[time=1289] God we pray today for those who are recovering from surgery for Judy Neusbaum and Jim Hutcheson that you would give to their bodies the healing processes of the nature that you have ordained.
[time=1303] We pray today for friends of Bob Kostru Banix who have lost a child for the Franks that you would comfort them. At the same time we rejoice with the Johnsons in the gift of life with which you have blessed their home.
[time=1319] Father today we pray for your peace and your comfort for the harder family and the untimely death of Dale this week.
[time=1329] Father we pray for those who have gone through a tragedy of broken relationships and we ask your spirit to strive in the hearts of men and women to turn their hearts towards home.
[time=1343] And now through your word we ask you to teach us and to guide us and to bless us in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=1371] Some may say that I am fearless, some may say that I am strong.
[time=1386] I am constantly dependent on His power and His love to create a need a person that I am.
[time=1401] And if there is a reason for this power and His love I know it must be Jesus in my heart, in my soul.
[time=1419] It is His faithfulness. It is His strength in me, my only confidence. I find in Jesus name it is His faithfulness.
[time=1439] It is His strength for me, to give me power to continue every day.
[time=1455] No I could not stand without Him, all my strength would fade away. I would be as lost and helpless as a man.
[time=1470] Yes I'm constantly dependent on the things He teaches me to give me power each and every day.
[time=1485] Yes it's true that I am fearless, yes it's true that I am strong, but Jesus is the reason, not myself, not my own.
[time=1503] It is His faithfulness. It is His strength in me, my only confidence. I find in Jesus name it is His faithfulness.
[time=1522] It is His strength in me, and all I owe to Him.
[time=1535] It is His faithfulness. It is His strength in me, my only confidence.
[time=1550] I find in Jesus name it is His faithfulness. It gives me rest of you, and in His faithfulness you will find the same.
[time=1569] Yes in His faithfulness you will find the same.
[time=1599] It is such a privilege to be a part of this church because you are an extraordinary caring and affirming body of people.
[time=1608] And I want to today do my very best to affirm you with God's Word and direct your attention to the Gospel according to Matthew and the 6th chapter and the 19th verse.
[time=1621] In the life of our church we usually take the time and today is one of those times to address the issue of stewardship in the life of our church.
[time=1631] Stewardship is a biblical word that speaks very practically to how we handle finances in the area of giving and the dispersing of funds within the life of our church.
[time=1644] Our church has been a very growing church. In the past year we have grown by 17% in our actual Sunday morning attendance.
[time=1653] That means for every 100 people who were here in 1986, 117 showed up in 1987. We rejoice with that, but with that growth comes not only opportunity but also some pressure on the parking lot, pressure on the facilities, and pressure on the budget.
[time=1672] And so this morning we need to talk a little bit like a family would talk about finances, but I'm really never comfortable with saying here's the budget and here's what we need to give.
[time=1683] Rather what I'd like us to do is to talk about the general area finances. I would really like to take what Jesus said on money and apply it to our life because more than meet our budget I'd really like to help each of us as individuals and family with our finances.
[time=1700] And then I believe in Reaganomics so far as the trickle-down effect that it will care for all of the needs of our church if we simply know what Jesus had to say about how we handle money.
[time=1711] So if you have your Bible, let's look what Jesus said about the stewardship of finances, Matthew chapter 6 beginning at verse 19.
[time=1721] Jesus said, "Do not store up for yourselves treasure on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[time=1746] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
[time=1763] But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?
[time=1776] No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[time=1789] You cannot serve both God and money. Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or drink, or about your body, what you will wear.
[time=1805] Is life not more important than food and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air. They do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them.
[time=1820] Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
[time=1831] And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow? They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in his splendor was dressed like one of these.
[time=1847] If that is how God clothes, the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you or you of little faith?
[time=1861] Do not worry, saying, what shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear? For the pagans run after all these things and your Heavenly Father knows that you need them.
[time=1877] But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[time=1897] I believe that the words of Jesus that we have just read here are the most helpful and yet most revolutionary words of anything that he ever spoke.
[time=1909] I believe that these words are both timeless and tested and there is probably nothing of all the scripture that I could have read today and that you could apply that would be more helpful to more people than what Jesus has said here.
[time=1924] I cannot remember a marriage counseling session that one of the issues was not money. I cannot remember it.
[time=1934] I cannot remember a time when a family was not struggling at some point over the issue of not enough funds.
[time=1943] The thing that has amazed me is that it comes from every socioeconomic strata of life. There are those who I happen to know their income and they make under $20,000 and they're a family of four and I know they're struggling.
[time=1960] Yet I hear the same struggles coming from families who will readily admit that their combined income well exceeds $100,000 and they face the same dilemmas.
[time=1972] I believe in the next 30 minutes I can share with you four principles of Jesus that will absolutely change your life for the better.
[time=1982] But I know that most of you can't stay with anything for 30 minutes and so let me give you the bottom line right now in 30 seconds.
[time=1993] Here is the bottom line. If you will do this in 95% of your lives it will change your life for the better and it will solve stress in your personal life.
[time=2006] It will leave anxiety in your marriage and it will give you a level of peace and contentment you've never had if you'll do this.
[time=2013] This is the bottom line. Here it is. You can go to sleep right after this but don't miss this.
[time=2021] Take your income. Give at least 10% of it away to the Lord.
[time=2027] Save at least 10% of it and live within the other 80%.
[time=2034] Barring tragedy in your life and circumstances beyond your control, if you will do what I suggest, it will work.
[time=2045] It is sound advice. It came from my grandmother.
[time=2049] But I believe she was biblical.
[time=2055] My grandparents started their business in the days of the Depression.
[time=2062] It was a noble business. It's called a chicken farm in the hills of Appalachia.
[time=2068] Things started off bad but they did get worse.
[time=2072] They moved as most everybody in Appalachia did in the 30s to Akron, Ohio.
[time=2080] They came there to work in the famous rubber factories.
[time=2085] My grandfather was one of those but they made a commitment when they hit the city of Akron, Ohio that they would save 10%.
[time=2095] And they did that in the days of poverty and they did that in the days of prosperity and now they're living very good at age 80 and spending it like crazy.
[time=2108] And you know what? They can afford to do it.
[time=2113] Now, let me draw you back to what Jesus said.
[time=2117] To expand upon that simple outline of life for very basic principles.
[time=2123] Principle number one is this. Redirect your life's priorities.
[time=2129] In verses 19, 20, and 21, Jesus issues a command.
[time=2134] There are two commands but it's one point, one giving it negatively, the other giving it positively and he says redirect your whole philosophy of life.
[time=2143] He says on the one hand stop storing up for yourselves treasures in this earth.
[time=2153] And on the other side of the coin he says start storing up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
[time=2159] He's looking at the society of his day and he saw their materialistic values and he said you're missing the boat.
[time=2167] You've got to stop spending money on a lifestyle and start investing in eternity.
[time=2177] And until you make this radical decision in your life never will money make sense and you'll never have enough.
[time=2187] Now some look at that and say oh Jesus is against saving, Jesus is against investing, Jesus is against insurance, that's not what it's saying.
[time=2198] Jesus is using comparisons and contrast and he's contrasting this individual who exclusively gives their life to the accumulation of wealth to the neglect of everything else comparing it to this individual who gives their life for eternity.
[time=2216] He's not against savings.
[time=2219] The structure of the language here if I can give you just a little bit of grammatical insight is it's called a present imperative and it refers to the individual who has now a character, a habit they have been repeatedly doing something.
[time=2235] And it's now coming with a negative it says stop doing that.
[time=2239] Let me give you an illustration that fits too well. We get up for breakfast and we eat a very healthy breakfast, fried eggs, fried potatoes, toast covered with cholesterol, I mean butter.
[time=2252] And we take all that in, we go out to lunch with the guys from the office and we go to one of these places all you can eat for one price and we feel it's our duty to punish the management for that foolish policy.
[time=2265] We go home and our wife has made our favor and we gorge ourselves only to cram in just a little bit more at dessert time and at the end of it we say I've got to stop eating.
[time=2278] Now by that we don't mean I'm 35 years old and it's time for me in life to stop eating and go the next 35 years of an average life without eating.
[time=2287] No that's not what we mean when we say stop eating, we mean stop abusing the privilege of eating, stop habitually overeating, get your life in balance.
[time=2299] When Jesus said stop storing up treasury, he wasn't saying don't ever save a penny, he's saying get life back in balance, redirect your priorities.
[time=2311] There's a second reason why I know that Jesus was not saying that and that is the word of God is full of sound practical advice encouraging us to save money.
[time=2323] Turn the book of Proverbs, stick something here in Matthew, a bulletin, a finger and turn to Proverbs chapter 6 verse 6.
[time=2333] Proverbs 6 says go to the ant you slugger, consider its ways and be wise, it has no commander, no overseer, no ruler, yet it stores up its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.
[time=2353] The Bible says if you have wisdom you'll be like an ant who knows how to accumulate in the days of abundance and save for the days of scarcity.
[time=2366] Proverbs is full of those encouragement, chapter 10 verse 5 holds 1 but turn to chapter 21 verse 20 please.
[time=2378] Proverbs 21 20 in the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil but a foolish man devours all that he has.
[time=2391] The Bible is very clear in telling us if we're wise we will save.
[time=2398] But we will not save, we will not hoard, we will not accumulate only to spend it on ourselves and hold it as a lifestyle.
[time=2408] We'll redirect our priorities and the redirection is that our finances are viewed in light of eternity and it says stop hoarding it on earth and start investing it in heaven.
[time=2423] Let me boil this down to the simplest application I've ever discovered. It has been so helpful for me. It is a book titled Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue.
[time=2434] And he correctly points out that there are five things you and I may do with money. I hope you'll write these down.
[time=2441] One, we can give money away. Two, we can use it to pay taxes. Three, we can save it or invest it.
[time=2456] Four, we can use it to reduce debt and five, we can spend it on a lifestyle. Now if you are a typical American here is the order in which you do these things.
[time=2471] One, you use it to pay taxes because Uncle Sam takes the money before you can get it and that is the only reason he's first.
[time=2481] And the reason I say that so emphatically I've talked to so many people who own their own businesses and they're responsible for withholding their own taxes.
[time=2489] You know what? Every year they panic, how am I going to come up with the tax money?
[time=2495] If you're a typical American though, your employer takes it out before you get it and the second thing you do with your money is you spend it on a lifestyle.
[time=2504] If you're a typical American, the third thing you do with it is you use the money to reduce debt so you can get your credit cards back under their minimum so you can in the words of one of my friends charge them back up again.
[time=2519] The fourth thing you do is you give it away which is very easy to do since there's nothing left you feel very generous. You'll give all that's not left away.
[time=2528] And the final thing you do if you're American is you save it.
[time=2533] Now what I believe the application of Jesus teaching is this redirect your priorities and here I believe are the biblical order that we should handle our money.
[time=2543] One, give it away.
[time=2545] Proverbs 3.5 says, "Honor the Lord with the first fruits and the substance of thy wealth."
[time=2552] Number two, pay your taxes. It was Jesus who said render under Caesar, that which is Caesar's.
[time=2560] Three, save a portion of your money.
[time=2565] Four, reduce your debts.
[time=2569] Five, live within the remaining balance as your lifestyle.
[time=2580] That is radical and it runs contrary to everything that society throws at us.
[time=2586] You notice the new sociological terms that are used to describe us today.
[time=2591] You're probably familiar with the word yuppy. That's been around for a decade.
[time=2595] The word yuppy stands for young urban professional.
[time=2599] It speaks about those who are young and because they are professionals, they have an unusual amount of money given their youthfulness.
[time=2608] And they are the targets of the consumer industry because they are yuppies.
[time=2613] But the word yuppy as the pinnacle of the sociological pyramid has now been replaced by the dink.
[time=2621] Are you familiar with dinks? Dink stands for D, double, I, income, and no, K, kids. Double income, no kids.
[time=2631] I'm making money. She's making money. We've got all this money in its arms. We don't have little kids that we've got to spend it on.
[time=2639] Our society says that's the way to be. Oh, wouldn't it be great if I was pulling down a salary? She was pulling down a salary.
[time=2646] We didn't have these expenses. We used to call them deductions. Now we call them expenses.
[time=2654] But that's the philosophy of our society is that money is to be lived on a lifestyle.
[time=2659] God says you're going to have to redirect your priorities and start investing it in view of eternity.
[time=2667] That is so radical. It goes so contrary. But listen to Jesus' reasoning.
[time=2674] He attacks this for these reasons. One, our money is preoccupied with self.
[time=2681] He said stop storing up money for yourselves. You know, money is often the greatest symbol of our selfishness.
[time=2690] This is mine. I possess it.
[time=2695] The second problem he saw with us, not only is it a preoccupation with self, but it's a poor investment.
[time=2702] In light of eternity. Jesus said stop storing it up where three things can happen to it.
[time=2708] One, mod's can eat it if it's a garment. Two, if it's a commodity like grain, it can be eaten.
[time=2717] Or if it's a metal, rust can consume it. Or three, it can be stolen.
[time=2723] One of the great things about eternal investments with God, there are no mods in heaven.
[time=2728] No thieves either. And inflation's at zero. It's the perfect investment.
[time=2736] And the third thing Jesus said is somewhat of a conclusion of this principle.
[time=2742] Verse 21, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=2748] Most of us have that verse backwards in our minds. I, for a long time, did.
[time=2754] I thought Jesus said where your heart is, there your treasure will be.
[time=2758] But that's not what the text reads. It says where your treasure is, your heart will be.
[time=2763] Which is telling us that investment precedes interest.
[time=2767] Let me give you an illustration. If you own no stocks, you will probably never turn to the stock page
[time=2776] and run your finger down the column to find out how a particular stock is doing.
[time=2782] But take a thousand dollars, invest it in that stock.
[time=2787] And notice how many times you reach for the newspaper and you take an interest in the Wall Street reports.
[time=2795] And your finger will find your stock and you'll have a keen interest because you have an investment.
[time=2802] If you would invest in eternity, your heart would follow.
[time=2807] But if you invest in materialism, your heart will linger there.
[time=2812] Principle number two, restrain your appetites.
[time=2818] This is so un-American, I almost feel unpatriotic in saying it.
[time=2824] Verses 22 and 23. The eye is the lamp of the body.
[time=2832] If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
[time=2835] But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.
[time=2840] What's Jesus saying here? He's saying that the eyes are the windows of the soul.
[time=2847] I remember ten years ago, we had a gelopy and that's being complimentary of this old car.
[time=2854] And we went out to buy a new to us used car.
[time=2860] And we looked at two or three of them and a slick salesman said, "You know, let me just show you this newer car."
[time=2866] We took us in, he showed us a new car, took us out for a drive.
[time=2870] We were suckers, we bought it in a moment.
[time=2873] We figured out a way we could borrow a little bit more and do this a little bit.
[time=2877] And you know what happened? Our eyes saw something and our heart began to want it.
[time=2884] You know one of the best ways you can control your appetite, Jesus said, is to restrain your eyes.
[time=2891] You're saying the eyes are the window of the soul and your appetites will increase based upon what they're exposed to.
[time=2900] And if we're ever going to manage our money, the second principle is we have got to restrain our appetites.
[time=2908] He uses the eyes as the window of the soul. John said it's the lust of the eyes to put it negatively.
[time=2915] And our appetites always increase and we always want just a little bit more and a little bit more.
[time=2921] But if our eyes are good, they're pure, they're generous, they're single, concentrated on eternity, they'll guide us well.
[time=2930] But if our eyes are bad, they wander, they're greedy, they're stingy, they will lead us to violate the first principle
[time=2939] and the horde and the keep and the spend on ourselves.
[time=2944] Let me share with you what I call four myths about money.
[time=2949] Myth number one, there is a relationship between increased holdings and increased happiness.
[time=2959] That is a myth. Happiness does not increase with holdings.
[time=2965] In fact, probably the evidence is just the same, that the more we have, the more we stew, and the more we have, the more we want.
[time=2973] A confession. I bought a bicycle. Good exercise, cranking around the neighborhood, riding my bike.
[time=2980] But you know when you buy a bike, you've got to buy some things. If you're going to have a bike, you've got to know how fast you're going.
[time=2985] So you've got to buy a speedometer. So I bought a speedometer.
[time=2989] Now, if you've got a bike and you want to ride it a long distance because you've got the speedometer, you need a little bag on the back, so you can carry stuff.
[time=2997] And if you've got a little bag on the back, you need something to put in the bag. I mean, what good's a bag that's empty?
[time=3002] So you've got to buy a spare tire and a tire change kit and a little gauge to measure how much air goes in, you put that all in there.
[time=3009] But what good's a spare tube? If you don't have a pump to blow it up, so you've got to buy a pump.
[time=3014] Then you watch on TV and you see these guys in the triathlon, they've got these handlebars that scoop up, and you can really ride.
[time=3022] I need one of those handlebars. You know what? Those handlebars cost more than my bike.
[time=3028] You see, the more you have, the more you want. It never stops.
[time=3034] Myth number two is that more cash would cure the crises.
[time=3039] How many times have you sat with the checkbook in this hand, the bills in the other, and you've lied to yourself, and you said, "Oh, if I just had a little bit more money, this wouldn't have been a problem." That is the biggest myth, because if you are having financial trouble and you had more money, what you would have done with that money is not paid off all these bills.
[time=3059] You would have used that money to buy a little bit more on more debt and you would have leveraged yourself into a worse position.
[time=3067] Myth number three, a little more is all I want.
[time=3073] That's really not a myth. It's true. The problem is it is always true.
[time=3078] Today you want a little more, and if you get it tomorrow, tomorrow you'll want a little more, and it goes on forever in life.
[time=3085] Contentment is either here today or it's never here. It's not one investment away.
[time=3092] Myth number four is my favorite. Managing my money would be easier if I just had more of it.
[time=3100] Now think about that. Does that work anywhere else in life? Picture the housewife who says, "Ugh, I cannot take it anymore.
[time=3108] These three kids are driving me crazy. I knew if we had six of them they'd be a lot easier to take care of."
[time=3114] You don't believe that? I've driven by your house. I saw your garage sale. Two of your kids were on the table.
[time=3125] More is never easier to manage. It only becomes harder.
[time=3132] Forget the more and control the appetites.
[time=3137] You and I are victims of the advertisers. We are victims of our associates, the Joneses, but most of all we are victims of our own appetites.
[time=3151] Until we control them and live within that magical 80%, having given away 10% or more and saved 10% or more,
[time=3162] the 80% will never be enough no matter how big it is. We must control our appetites.
[time=3168] Principle number three is found in verse 24. "No one can serve two masters, either he will hate the one and love the other,
[time=3176] or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
[time=3182] The third principle is this one. We must relinquish the controls of our life to God.
[time=3191] The new international version takes an interpretive liberty, one with which I agree.
[time=3198] At the end of verse 24, they said you cannot serve both God and they've capitalized God and money, and they chose to capitalize the word money.
[time=3210] What they are doing is they're interpreting for us and they're saying that money is a rival God.
[time=3218] I believe their exegesis of the text is absolutely accurate. Jesus is saying there are two gods who will you serve.
[time=3225] Me are money. And money has a power to control us and the onus and possess us.
[time=3234] And money and possessions and shopping and buying and accumulating can be as addictive as any narcotic you'll ever take.
[time=3242] And it can be as intoxicating as any beverage you'll ever ingest.
[time=3248] It is a rival God and you must choose who will you lay the reins that control your life into whose hands will you lay those?
[time=3258] Will you lay them into Jesus Christ's hands and allow God to direct your finances?
[time=3263] Or will you lay them in the hands of a false God called money and allow it to call these shots?
[time=3271] It's radical and it must be done.
[time=3275] The fourth principle is this. It is to release your anxiety.
[time=3283] In other words, don't worry. Verses 25 through 34. Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life.
[time=3292] Now let me interrupt our flow here for a moment.
[time=3295] The only ones who should not worry are those who do the first three things.
[time=3300] Redirect their priorities, restrain their appetites, and relinquish the control of their life to God.
[time=3308] Those people should release their anxiety.
[time=3311] If you haven't done those three things, then ignore principle 4 and immediately begin to worry because you've got plenty to worry about.
[time=3320] You can't take the fourth principle without following the first three.
[time=3326] Jesus' simple statement is, in light of that, don't worry.
[time=3332] Now that sounds so radical, he took the time to justify it.
[time=3336] Let me give you five reasons why Jesus said you don't have to worry.
[time=3339] One, he says, material worry is inappropriate.
[time=3344] Verses 25. Don't worry, I tell you about your life, what you will eat, drink, or about your body, what you will wear.
[time=3352] Isn't life more important than food for the body and clothing?
[time=3357] He said, you're missing the whole point of life. It's inappropriate because the chief issue of life is spiritual.
[time=3367] The second point he makes, worry is inconsistent with common sense.
[time=3372] He gives two illustrations. He says, look, look at the birds of the air and look at the lilies of the field.
[time=3377] God provides for them.
[time=3380] The birds don't sow, they don't reap, they don't store in barns, yet God takes care of them.
[time=3386] Look at the flowers of the field, they're beautiful, but yet they never once went out to the department store to buy clothing.
[time=3393] The argument is common sense as if God takes care of them, he will take care of you.
[time=3399] The conclusion is this, aren't you more important than they?
[time=3406] Jesus' third reason is that worry is ineffective, verse 27.
[time=3411] He says, who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
[time=3417] Do you know if you worry about something, it's not going to help you.
[time=3420] In fact, it won't increase your life, but it may decrease it.
[time=3425] Fourth reason Jesus gives is worry is incompatible with Christian faith.
[time=3430] Verse 30, he chastises us for saying, oh you of little faith.
[time=3437] If we really trust the Lord, we don't have to worry.
[time=3441] The fifth thing he says is worry overloads the system.
[time=3445] Verse 34, don't take tomorrow's worries today, you're going to have plenty to worry about tomorrow.
[time=3453] Each day has enough grief of its own.
[time=3458] These are four simple principles that will help not only the church budget, but will help your family budget, will help your very relationships, allow me to capture them for you one more time.
[time=3471] One, redirect your priorities.
[time=3474] Give to the Lord first, save second, spend it on a lifestyle last.
[time=3480] Number two, restrain your appetites.
[time=3483] Number three, relinquish the control of your life to Christ.
[time=3488] And number four, release your anxiety.
[time=3492] It's been a privilege again to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, our handbell choir and soloist Denise Mitchell, and the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3503] Again, if as a result of this program you've made a decision concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3512] Just as with our friend Dale Harder, we really don't know when God will call us to be with him.
[time=3517] We need to know him as personal Savior so that we can have eternal life with Jesus Christ.
[time=3522] If you'd like to pray this prayer, would you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3526] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this day.
[time=3530] I thank you for the realization that I need Christ as Savior.
[time=3534] I ask you to come into my heart today to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse my heart.
[time=3541] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3545] If you made a decision today, write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3549] And when you write, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3556] To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "The Best Pocket Companion," please write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
