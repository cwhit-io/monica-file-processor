[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=100] There's an old question that bears repeating.
[time=104] If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?
[time=111] [MUSIC]
[time=121] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study, Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=125] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=127] Rick's message today is entitled "A Son, a Savior, His Mission" and is taken from Matthew 20 verses 17 through 19.
[time=136] Christ's mission was clear.
[time=138] He continually reminded his disciples that he had come to die, to die as a ransom for sin, our sin.
[time=145] His mission is our mission.
[time=147] We are His ambassadors to the world with one assignment to announce the good news.
[time=152] The ransom has been paid.
[time=154] Unfortunately, many of us do not appear to be ambassadors.
[time=158] Instead, we conduct ourselves like secret agents.
[time=161] No one knows that we are Christians.
[time=163] And worse, some of us are actually defectors.
[time=167] We have abandoned our post.
[time=169] Today is a day for remembering our mission for rekindling our allegiance.
[time=174] We hope you will study with us and reaffirm your life's mission.
[time=179] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=183] We will be looking at Matthew 20 verses 17 through 19.
[time=188] Our special music today includes a song from the Sanctuary Choir and Keith and Starr Braddock.
[time=196] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=205] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=209] Now here's Rick.
[time=211] Today, it's a joy not only to be able to share the Lord Jesus Christ with this audience but with our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=221] As we meet on a Sunday morning, it's not simply a tradition.
[time=225] It's an opportunity.
[time=227] It's an opportunity for us to declare on this morning that Jesus Christ arose from the grave victorious.
[time=234] Having died from my sins, he's alive again.
[time=238] And we come to say there's joy in this morning and there's joy in worshiping him.
[time=243] We pray that God's Spirit will give you the freedom to lay the burdens of your heart aside and to experience the joy of worshiping him.
[time=251] I hope you will enjoy our choirs they sing about joy in the morning.
[time=281] Let me joy in the morning.
[time=283] Let me joy in the morning of the day.
[time=291] For the day like the dark and the darkness is gone.
[time=296] Let me joy in the morning of the day.
[time=300] There'll be peace.
[time=307] There'll be earth cause for every heart and voice.
[time=311] There'll every choice.
[time=313] There'll be peace.
[time=315] There'll be here so.
[time=317] And the glory.
[time=319] Glory.
[time=320] Glory of the Lord will shine.
[time=323] We'll shine.
[time=325] Shine the hollas and the glory.
[time=327] Glory.
[time=329] Glory of the Lord will bring a truth divine.
[time=334] There'll be love and forgiveness everywhere.
[time=343] And the way of the Lord will let give me restore.
[time=348] There'll be loss in love everywhere.
[time=362] (singing in foreign language)
[time=392] [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=462] - Joy in serving Jesus, not only when we look forward
[time=476] to that day when he comes again, but now we'll continue to praise his precious name.
[time=480] Him number 68, praise him, praise him.
[time=483] Jesus, high blessed are Redeemer.
[time=485] I'm gonna ask you to stand again and sing and sing heartily this great song of praise, all three verses, number 68.
[time=493] [MUSIC - 158 seconds]
[time=656] - Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=661] - We have our privilege with us today,
[time=667] two of the missionaries, that we have the opportunity of supporting.
[time=671] They are Dave and Barb Taylor, who are with us from San Paulo, Brazil, and I'm going to ask them to join me so that you have a chance to meet them this morning.
[time=681] They are home for the year, not having a restful year.
[time=686] You may or may not be aware of what a missionary's schedule is like, for the most part, a missionary commits their like to serving the Lord on a particular field.
[time=695] In their case, it's Brazil.
[time=697] Usually a missionary spends three, four hours, much as five years on that location.
[time=702] They come home usually for a year.
[time=705] It's not a year of R and R, it's usually a year of deputation, raising support, reporting to the many churches and people that support them, and then head back out.
[time=715] Taylor's welcome home, home in the sense that the Midwest was originally home, but I know you feel that Brazil's home for you now.
[time=723] Tell our friends a little bit about the city in which you serve in the people of San Paulo.
[time=728] - Thank you very much, Pastor.
[time=730] First of all, we want to say thank you to this church that has been so faithful over these many years in supporting our ministry down in San Paulo.
[time=738] We have a son who's at Cedarville College in broadcasting.
[time=742] A daughter is 14 years of age and also a six-year-old daughter.
[time=747] We have been on the field since 1972 and 15 years, three terms on the field in church planning, in a city that has 14, and the latest statistics we read were 16 million people.
[time=759] Well, what's a million give or take?
[time=761] But it's been a thrill to represent this church, and this church is a part of our team back in the United States as we are in church planning down there.
[time=771] It's a city that for many years was called the fastest growing city in the world.
[time=775] Now it is still one of the fastest growing, but the largest city in all of the southern hemisphere.
[time=779] - Barb, you were telling me a little bit about the area in which your church exists and how the population is so intense.
[time=786] Sure, just a little bit of that, please.
[time=789] - Okay, we're working in the largest government housing district in all of South America.
[time=793] 165,000 people within a square mile of our church.
[time=798] - To give a perspective on that, our city, I think is about 180,000 people.
[time=803] That would be our whole city in one square mile.
[time=807] You're pastoring a church, helping to train nationals to pastor the church.
[time=811] Tell us a little bit about the church there.
[time=813] - Our philosophy of church planning is to begin with a national, a Brazilian in this situation, and take that church to the point where they can call their own Brazilian pastor, and it is self-supporting, self-governing.
[time=830] In every way, it's autonomous, and then we, of course, leave and come back and try to find that year of rest and relaxation, and then go back to start another church.
[time=840] The church that we were privileged to work in this last five years was started by another missionary that his church supports, Norm Nicholas.
[time=848] He came back to the United States to begin working with ABWUSA in planning churches here in the United States to broaden the base so we'd have more churches to be able to send out more missionaries to the foreign field.
[time=861] This church, when we went to it in 1982, had about 50 members and about 100 in attendance.
[time=868] When we left, there were 150 members, and about 300 in attendance has the evangelism training for winning people to the Lord in their homes, has the Iwanah program for our children, Deacon carrying program, and a lot of the programs at your church right here in Fort Wayne has put into practice and has caused your church to grow in such a mighty way.
[time=891] - Well, we were talking earlier this morning, and you mentioned that people were coming to the Lord.
[time=896] We're so encouraged by that, but you also mentioned that one of the things that's growing is spiritism, and tell our people a little bit about what that is.
[time=905] - Well, spiritism is a very fancy word for demon worship.
[time=909] As the slave trade came into the United States
[time=915] many, many years ago, at the same time, all through the Caribbean and Central America and South America, the same slave trade was going in to these other countries, and so at about the same time that was happening here in the United States, slavery was going on in Brazil.
[time=934] The people, the Negroes, the slaves, received the same abuse, in fact, in many cases, much worse in all through South America than they did even here in the United States, because the slave trade hit in the United States Christianity, which was a real buffer, but down in Brazil, it hit a religion that was a full of idolatry and ignorance and superstition, and consequently did not meet the needs of the heart and the soul, and over the years, that spiritism or demon worship has grown to the place where it is the fastest growing religion in all of Brazil, all of the countries of South America and Central America and the Caribbean that had the slave trade that did not have Christianity to meet as a buffer as they went into that country today are dominated by spiritism or voodoo or demon worship.
[time=989] It is a definite obstacle in the ministry, ongoing ministry of the gospel in any country, yes.
[time=998] - Let's take a moment and bow together and pray for the tailors and particularly for the church there.
[time=1005] God, we are thankful for your goodness, and we would pray for these brothers and sisters who are serving you in San Paulo, Brazil, who are facing such an enemy of Satan himself that your hand would be upon them to encourage them, strengthen them, and give them power from above.
[time=1025] We pray for Dave and Barb while they're home that they would receive great encouragement that you would refresh them and send them back with an increased mission and vitality to serve you.
[time=1036] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1039] Thank you so much.
[time=1040] Now it's our privilege to hear from the ministry of Keith and Starr Brodingham, as they sing for us this morning.
[time=1048] [MUSIC - 162 seconds]
[time=1215] - We want to welcome you again
[time=1225] and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1229] Pete, how are you today?
[time=1230] - I'm doing fine, Rick.
[time=1231] It feels good to feel normal again.
[time=1233] We've all kind of had a bout with the flu and colds and understand you're feeling a lot better too.
[time=1238] - I feel great.
[time=1239] That's two weeks of on and off with the flu, I feel great.
[time=1242] It's a great feeling to kind of feel like you're normal again as it relates to our physical feelings.
[time=1248] If some of you've been battling the flu that's going around, we certainly give you our sympathy and hope that you make a speedy recovery.
[time=1256] Coming up just in a week from tonight, but actually as our friends are watching it, it's tonight, March the 13th.
[time=1263] We have a special music group with us.
[time=1265] - Right, Rick, we should note March the 13th.
[time=1267] That's an important date at 6 p.m. here in the Convocation Center.
[time=1271] We're going to have the Men of Tennessee Temple University, their men's chorus.
[time=1276] They're directed by Tim Jeffers.
[time=1277] Tim was a student of mine back at Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1282] He was a fine tenor soloist and I'm looking forward to the opportunity of seeing one of my former students directing his corral.
[time=1289] This will be an exciting time.
[time=1291] Always great to hear men's sing of the glory of God and so put that date on your calendar.
[time=1297] That's March 13th at 6 p.m. here in the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1302] Well, that's something to look forward to.
[time=1304] And also we have a duo coming called Hicks and Cohegan.
[time=1308] They're not a music duo.
[time=1310] They're actually an inspirational comic team.
[time=1314] Now that may take you by surprise because we're not used to hearing about Christian comedians, but these two young men use comic, humor, laughter to convey a lot of the joy in the Christian life, but also some subtle messages that get us to really think about our Christian life.
[time=1332] I've enjoyed hearing them twice previously and looking forward to them being a black hawk here in April.
[time=1337] Well, that's going to be an exciting time too.
[time=1339] You know, as you've mentioned before, there are varieties in our Christian life and sometimes we just need a little bit of humor.
[time=1346] But along with that humor, they get a point across to make us think about our Christian lives.
[time=1351] They'll be here with us on April 30th and it's a dinner concert at 6.30 and then they'll be presenting their program about 7.30 and believe me, you'll have a lot to laugh about.
[time=1361] You'll enjoy the time together and we're going to have a great time of fellowship that night, April 30th.
[time=1366] I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1368] A couple months ago, we were watching a religious broadcast that will go unnamed and our daughter, Rebecca, who is somewhat of a wit anyway, in all seriousness, looked at the man preaching.
[time=1379] She said, "Daddy, what's that man so mad about?" And in many ways, I think sometimes we portray ourselves as Christians, as somebody who is upset, uptight, and frustrated and it's good to know there's joy.
[time=1393] And so if you'll plan on joining us on April 30th, we'll have some joy to share with you.
[time=1398] If you'd like information about tickets, you could write to us and we'll give you that address in just a moment.
[time=1404] But as you write, we want to encourage you to write for a very helpful little booklet called The Vest Pocket Companion.
[time=1410] It's a resource tool to help you and to help me find some of the scriptures that may not be at the top of our head or the tip of our tongue.
[time=1419] Scriptures do encourage your own hearts or to encourage your friend.
[time=1423] And this Vest Pocket Companion is something that you can do exactly what it says.
[time=1426] Keep it in your vest pocket or ladies in your purse.
[time=1430] And it's just a helpful Bible study tool to keep the scriptures right at our fingertips.
[time=1435] We'd love to send you a copy to help you as a Christian worker to share Christ with others.
[time=1440] If you'll simply write to us today, we'll give you a copy free and we'll be glad to share with you information about Hickson Cohegan as you write.
[time=1449] If you'd like information about the program on April 30th or The Vest Pocket Companion for Christian Workers, write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1464] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1472] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today as we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1477] We have the privilege of hearing from Keith and Starr Brodingham again, and we know that that will be an inspiration and an encouragement to each of us.
[time=1486] (gentle music)
[time=1494] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=1695] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 58 seconds]
[time=1763] (gentle piano music)
[time=1770] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=1925] (gentle piano music) - Let us stand please to recite this week's memory verse.
[time=1940] Matthew 621, for where your treasure is,
[time=1949] there your heart will be also.
[time=1953] Matthew 621, thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1957] - Thank you, Dale, and I am so thankful for those of you who have made it your habit and your discipline to memorize God's word.
[time=1968] That's a challenge week by week to memorize a verse, so every once in a while we throw in an easy one, and this was that Sunday where you got that short little easy verse, but from time to time we'll stretch you, but as you memorize God's word, it will become from within your own heart a sense of authority and confidence for living.
[time=1989] I'd like to invite you now to bow with me that we could pray together.
[time=1993] Father, the words of that hymn linger in my mind.
[time=1996] My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine,
[time=2002] and for thee, all of the fallies of sin, I resign.
[time=2012] My gracious Redeemer, my Savior, art thou.
[time=2017] If ever I love thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
[time=2023] Lord, we do love you.
[time=2027] We've set these moments aside to quiet our hearts from the hurry, scurry, and worry of life to calmly reflect that our God is greater than every circumstance, every situation we face.
[time=2043] And we've come today to not only tell you that we love you, but to rekindle the flame of allegiance, to re-declare and express our loyalty to you and our desire to live for you today.
[time=2059] And so we ask you to meet with us, and we ask you by your spirit to teach us your word, not that we might only have an increase of knowledge, but that we might have change in character and conduct.
[time=2072] God, take your word and drive it into our living and help us today to reflect Jesus Christ and our attitudes and our decisions.
[time=2084] We would pray today that you would use this hour as a time of comfort in the hearts of those who are discouraged.
[time=2093] Many have fought a jobless situation for a long time.
[time=2097] Others are battling with underemployment.
[time=2101] God, we would ask you to give refuge to them and provide for their need.
[time=2106] Others are discouraged because relationships have grown bitter, and we ask you to guard our hearts against bitterness and make of us great forgivers.
[time=2116] Father, we would pray particularly this morning for Julie Berkholder.
[time=2121] She would discover yesterday the high possibility of cancer.
[time=2125] We pray that your hand would be upon her life and upon the child that she's caring, and you would protect both of them.
[time=2133] We ask for wisdom for her doctors.
[time=2136] We'd pray for Gail Spence, Wayne Weaver's sister, that as she has learned that she has cancer, that you would comfort her heart as well.
[time=2146] We pray for our Dean Markerin, and for Eleanor Layman, as these ladies fight cancer day by day, may your hand be upon them.
[time=2155] We would pray this morning for those who are in need of your intercession in their lives.
[time=2163] We pray for Bob Mishler's mother, and for Ev Southwell, as she's home for medical treatment from the mission field, for Russell Solon, Roy Sigland.
[time=2174] God, we ask you to be the God of all comfort to each of these in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2181] There is an old question that bears repeating.
[time=2187] It is this one.
[time=2189] If you were arrested right now on the charge
[time=2196] of being a Christian, would there be enough evidence that convict you?
[time=2204] If you were brought before trial and your neighbors, your employer, your employees, the people who walk with you daily, or summons the court to give testimony, would their words indict you and convict you of the charge of being a Christian?
[time=2223] Our lives are called for one mission, and one mission only.
[time=2230] It is to know Christ and to make him known.
[time=2233] How are you doing on your lifetime assignment?
[time=2240] If you have your Bible, I invite you to open it to the Gospel of Matthew.
[time=2244] That's the first book in the New Testament.
[time=2247] Matthew is one of four men who, under the inspiration of God, give to us a narrative of the life of Christ.
[time=2256] We're studying the life of Christ, and today, we want to discover his mission, and from that, make application to our life mission as well.
[time=2267] In Matthew's Gospel, I believe he has taken the first 15 chapters
[time=2274] to set the stage, and chapter 16 is a pivotal point.
[time=2279] In the first 15 chapters, he presents Christ as the Savior,
[time=2287] the Messiah, as actually God.
[time=2291] The names are given, thou shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save the people from their sins.
[time=2298] The name of Manuel is given, God with us.
[time=2302] He unfolds prophecy from the Old Testament hundreds of years before Christ, and shows how Jesus fulfilled those, giving him the credentials of the Messiah.
[time=2313] He shows his supernatural power over temptation when he resists the attack of Satan himself.
[time=2320] In Matthew, chapters eight, nine, and 10,
[time=2326] he shows his authority as the king over all of nature.
[time=2331] He provides healing ministry.
[time=2333] Nothing bogus, nothing staged.
[time=2335] Men that everybody knew who had been blind from birth to adulthood, Jesus heals them
[time=2345] and they see perfectly.
[time=2346] Individuals who had obvious problems, such as bleeding open sores, Jesus heals, and they're instantly better.
[time=2355] But Jesus not only demonstrated his authority and his deity by healing, but by supernatural power over nature.
[time=2364] On one occasion, Jesus was on a boat.
[time=2368] The boat is sailing through a calm sea.
[time=2370] The sea erupts into a violent storm.
[time=2372] The disciples, professional boatmen, fishermen, are so overwhelmed that they're in fear for their life.
[time=2379] Jesus walks to the front of that boat, stands on the bow and he says, peace be still, the wind, the waves, the sea, everything, instantly obeys him.
[time=2391] That is proof that he is God, the sea obeys him.
[time=2396] I am not much of a fisherman.
[time=2399] I've been deep sea fishing one time in the Gulf of Mexico.
[time=2403] It was a day like the day in Christ's life.
[time=2406] Calm, beautiful day.
[time=2407] We went out, we started catching King Mackerel, Benita and a few other fish, and a squall blew up and our little boats started going up and down and up and down and my stomach was going up as the boat was going down and I leaned over the front of the bow and the scripture came to my mind and I yelled out, peace be still and nothing happened.
[time=2429] The reason being is the wind and the sea don't know my voice
[time=2435] but they know the voice of the God who made them and when Jesus said, peace be still, it was proof to a watching world that he and he alone was the Messiah.
[time=2449] And for 15 chapters, Matthew has been presenting the evidence
[time=2455] when you come to Matthew chapter 16, Jesus pulls his disciples aside.
[time=2460] He says to Peter and the rest of them, who do you say that I am?
[time=2465] Peter says, you're the Christ, the Son of the living God
[time=2471] and Jesus affirms that.
[time=2474] He not only affirms it by saying you're right Peter but he says, Peter, I'm going to give you the keys to my kingdom and nothing will stop it.
[time=2484] Nothing including the gates of hell will stop it.
[time=2489] And right now the disciples are ready to march on Jerusalem.
[time=2494] They're ready to take it over.
[time=2496] They're going to set up a kingdom.
[time=2498] They got the king, they got the keys.
[time=2499] Man, the program's ready to fly.
[time=2502] And at that pinnacle of expectation, notice what Jesus says in Matthew 16, 21.
[time=2512] From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples
[time=2521] that he must go to Jerusalem.
[time=2523] You can almost hear Peter saying, yeah, Jerusalem.
[time=2525] That's the point, we're going to go in Jerusalem, we're going to set up this kingdom.
[time=2529] Christ said, now I've got to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders,
[time=2540] chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
[time=2550] Peter took him aside and said, never, Lord, this will never happen to you.
[time=2557] Jesus rebuked him and said, out of my sight, Satan.
[time=2564] Well, you talk about an emotional roller coaster.
[time=2567] Here are these men, they've been the eyewitnesses of all the miracles.
[time=2571] Christ has set him down.
[time=2573] They've announced he's the Messiah.
[time=2574] He says, you're right.
[time=2575] He starts talking about the keys of the kingdom and suddenly just like a bloated stomach that knocks the wind out of you.
[time=2583] Jesus says, I'm going to be turned over to my enemies and I'm going to die.
[time=2588] That was so foreign that it was repugnant to the mind of the disciples.
[time=2595] Notice it here in chapter 16, verse 21, it says from that time on, Jesus began.
[time=2603] First time he's told them clearly that he's going to die.
[time=2607] They should have known it.
[time=2609] Now, why do I say that?
[time=2611] Well, they had three opportunities to know this ahead of time.
[time=2615] Opportunity number one is Christ's mission was foretold by the prophets.
[time=2620] Old Testament prophets were given by God the supernatural ability to know the future to write it down so that when it came about, people would recognize this is God at work.
[time=2633] One of those prophets who lived hundreds of years before Christ was a man by the name of Isaiah.
[time=2639] If you can find Isaiah, let's look at Isaiah 53 together.
[time=2643] If you're not real familiar with your Bible, you can check the table of contents or feel free just to listen.
[time=2650] But on Isaiah 53, Isaiah the prophet writes about the coming Messiah and what his mission would include.
[time=2659] In Isaiah 53, verse three, it says, he was despised and rejected by men.
[time=2667] A man of sorrows, familiar with suffering, like one from whom men hide their faces.
[time=2675] He was despised and we esteemed him not.
[time=2681] Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows.
[time=2688] Yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him and afflicted.
[time=2693] But he was pierced for our transgressions.
[time=2697] He was crushed for our iniquities.
[time=2701] The punishment that brought us peace was upon him.
[time=2707] And by his wounds, we are healed.
[time=2711] You see, it should have not been a complete surprise to the disciples that even though Christ was Messiah, that he would suffer and that he would die.
[time=2722] They were forewarned by the prophets.
[time=2724] They were warned by John the Baptist.
[time=2727] At the very beginning of Jesus' public ministry, he walks down to the Jordan to be baptized by John the baptizer and John sees him coming and points to him and says, behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[time=2743] Those people knew what a lamb did.
[time=2746] A lamb did one thing.
[time=2748] A lamb died and its blood was shed as an atonement for sin.
[time=2755] John was saying, here's the lamb.
[time=2757] They should have known that he would die.
[time=2761] They had a third warning.
[time=2763] Jesus himself foretold his resurrection.
[time=2768] And if you're gonna have a resurrection, it usually pre-requires a death.
[time=2772] Again, early in his ministry in John two, and in Matthew 12, Jesus was asked from a point of hostility.
[time=2781] You say you're the Messiah, what proof do you have?
[time=2786] And Jesus said, in three days, I'll rise again.
[time=2792] So the disciples should have known this, but to their benefit, Christ has never before Matthew 16 sat down and laid it out, cards face up and said, I'm going to suffer and I'm gonna die.
[time=2809] Allow me to give you a quick geography lesson.
[time=2813] Israel is a rather small country.
[time=2815] It's really about one fifth the size of Indiana.
[time=2819] At this time, it's divided into several regions.
[time=2823] The Northern region is called Galilee.
[time=2826] The Southern region is called Judea.
[time=2829] Jesus spends his time going back and forth, but most of it's in the North and Galilee.
[time=2836] But Matthew chapter 16 takes place outside of Israel.
[time=2840] Christ is in a city called Caesarea Philippi.
[time=2843] Here's Judea, here's Galilee.
[time=2846] Right above all, that is Caesarea Philippi.
[time=2850] They're up there, out of Israel.
[time=2852] And Jesus says, I've got to go down to Jerusalem and suffer and die.
[time=2860] He began in Matthew 16.
[time=2864] Now follow me through a few passages of Matthew, and you'll see it says repeated message.
[time=2869] Matthew 17, verse 22.
[time=2876] It says, when they came together, they meaning Jesus and his disciples in Galilee.
[time=2883] So Jesus is geographically moving from North of Israel back down into Northern Israel.
[time=2891] He's moving closer to Jerusalem.
[time=2894] And so he reminds them, the son of man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
[time=2902] They will kill him.
[time=2904] And on the third day, he will be raised to life and the disciples were filled with grief.
[time=2914] I think Jesus told them that in Caesarea Philippi
[time=2920] and he moved back into Galilee and he reminded them that they might know he is in the process of fulfilling his mission.
[time=2931] He's moving closer.
[time=2935] Come to Matthew chapter 19, verse one.
[time=2939] It says, when Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea.
[time=2948] Caesarea Philippi, then Galilee.
[time=2954] Galilee, now Judea.
[time=2958] Chapter 20, verse 17.
[time=2964] Now, as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the 12 disciples aside and said to them,
[time=2975] we are going up to Jerusalem and the son of man will be betrayed to the chief priest and teachers of the law.
[time=2987] They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified.
[time=2997] On the third day, he will be raised back to life.
[time=3003] Can you see what Jesus is doing?
[time=3006] Caesarea Philippi, I'm gonna suffer and I'm gonna die in Jerusalem.
[time=3013] He moved south to Galilee.
[time=3015] Galilee, he says, I've got to suffer.
[time=3018] I've got to die.
[time=3020] Galilee to Judea.
[time=3023] In Judea, the city of Jerusalem, they're now on their way and he said, I'm going to suffer.
[time=3029] I'm going to die.
[time=3031] A final reference at the end of this speech, Matthew 20, 28,
[time=3038] just as the son of man did not come to be served,
[time=3046] but to serve and to give his life as a ransom.
[time=3053] For many.
[time=3054] I bring us through that study of Matthew for two reasons.
[time=3060] One, so that you can see that Christ's central mission
[time=3066] was to die, to give his life as a ransom for many.
[time=3072] And two, that you might understand the application of this verse.
[time=3079] Jesus was saying to his followers, if you are going to follow me, you've got to take up my mission and make it yours.
[time=3090] The disciples here are arguing about greatness.
[time=3093] And Christ said, you wanna know he's the greatest, the one of you will become the servant.
[time=3098] You must become just like the son of man, his favorite name for himself.
[time=3104] My mission to deny myself, my mission to serve, my mission to give my life as a ransom, and your mission is to take up my mission.
[time=3118] The word ransom, unfortunately, is a very familiar word to us.
[time=3125] It means the same in Greek as it does in English.
[time=3130] When we pick up the newspaper and we hear of a kidnapping and a child is taken and is being held kidnapped, the abductors write the family and they ask for money, that money is called a ransom.
[time=3145] Or when we pick up the paper and we read of a hostage situation and hostages have been taken and they will not be released until demands are met, those demands represent a ransom.
[time=3160] A ransom is a price that is paid
[time=3166] or an exchange that is made to release someone who is held captive.
[time=3174] A ransom is a price that is paid or an exchange that is made to release someone who is held captive.
[time=3186] Jesus said, I have come to give my life as a payment in exchange for those who are held captive.
[time=3196] The Bible tells us elsewhere that the captives are you and me.
[time=3203] Jesus said that we are being held like prisoners.
[time=3208] We are bound like chained men and women as slaves to sin.
[time=3213] And that sin possesses us.
[time=3218] It owns us.
[time=3220] You've heard out of the scriptures that the wages of sin is death.
[time=3224] The only ransom that could be paid to release us is death.
[time=3229] And the only death that is acceptable is a spotless life.
[time=3237] And because we're sinners, we cannot pay that.
[time=3242] Only the spotless Christ could pay it.
[time=3247] In Matthew 20, 20, 8, it says that he became a ransom
[time=3253] for us.
[time=3255] The word for is stronger than meaning simply in behalf of.
[time=3259] It actually means instead of simple illustration.
[time=3264] If I start saying, oh, I've got a busy day.
[time=3269] I've got this meeting and that meeting.
[time=3271] And I need to go to the store and I've got to pick up these supplies.
[time=3274] You might say, Rick, I will go to the store for you.
[time=3282] You're doing it instead of me, so I don't have to.
[time=3287] Christ said, I'm giving my life as a ransom for you,
[time=3293] instead of you.
[time=3295] You see, the options are twofold.
[time=3299] Option A is we can die and spend eternity in hell.
[time=3303] They're giving our life forever as a ransom for those sins.
[time=3308] Or option B, Christ can die instead of us.
[time=3313] And because he's God, his death is big enough to cover every sin in the world.
[time=3318] That was his mission.
[time=3322] But the most important application is as Jesus unfolds
[time=3329] his mission, he then transitions to say, my mission is your mission.
[time=3337] Just as the son of man came not to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.
[time=3345] Christ was saying, if you're to follow me, you must take my mission and make it your mission.
[time=3352] We live in a time where so many of us
[time=3358] are struggling with purpose in life.
[time=3363] Can I tell you the most common individual who is struggling for purpose in life today?
[time=3371] They are and an American.
[time=3379] They may be male or female.
[time=3382] They're at least what we would call middle class, but probably upper middle class.
[time=3390] They are people who have nice houses like mine.
[time=3396] Good job, adequate income.
[time=3399] Matter of fact, their income is strong enough that they've got gadgets.
[time=3405] The latest, the latest of every kind.
[time=3408] And week by week, they have everything that they could ever need.
[time=3415] They've had a lifelong dream and it's fulfilled already in the middle of life.
[time=3421] They thought what I wanted was a family.
[time=3425] They got a family.
[time=3426] They thought what I wanted was a house.
[time=3427] Got a house, just in the right neighborhood.
[time=3429] And on the inside, they are empty and they are bored.
[time=3435] And they will go to counselors, the psychologists, to pastors, to Christian workers, and they will tell of their meaninglessness, and they will tell of their emptiness, and they will hear good advice, but it will not help because they do not have a life mission.
[time=3458] You see, in life, we have but one mission.
[time=3465] It is to know Christ and then to make him known.
[time=3470] And we will be empty, miserable people
[time=3476] until we come to the realization that nothing else matters.
[time=3481] Sure, it's great if all these things fall along the way, but at the core, if you don't have a mission, your life is empty.
[time=3488] And no matter how much you fill it on the outside, it eats away on the inside.
[time=3495] It's been a privilege to share with you
[time=3507] the ministry of our sanctuary choir and Keith and Star Brodygum, as well as the message from God's word from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3515] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal savior.
[time=3520] Just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3524] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3526] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Christ
[time=3532] to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3535] Today I know that I'm a sinner and that I need you to come into my heart.
[time=3539] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me from my sin and live in my heart today.
[time=3545] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3548] If you prayed this prayer today, would you write us and tell us of that decision?
[time=3553] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
