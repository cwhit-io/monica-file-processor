[time=112] [MUSIC]
[time=119] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study, Music, and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=123] Our speaker today is Don Fanning, a word of life interned in Argentina.
[time=128] Please locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=131] Special music today includes a song from Rejoice, an instrumental solo from Dave Johnson, and a solo from Marilyn Wong.
[time=143] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Huyton, Indiana and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=151] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=156] Today we also welcome those of you that are watching through the Bible Hour.
[time=161] I'm glad to have you join us during this hour.
[time=164] It's been an exciting morning already as we've had Don Fanning speak to us in our first service and you're going to be blessed and challenged by his ministry a little bit later.
[time=173] Pastor Rick Hawks is away from us today speaking in a church in Michigan.
[time=177] We wish him well and know that God is blessing as he speaks up there.
[time=181] We're going to continue now with our music that honors the Lord, that speaks of commitment.
[time=186] I'll go where you want me to go. Rejoice comes to sing for us.
[time=190] Let's listen and be challenged by the message that they have for us.
[time=207] To you Lord, wherever you leave.
[time=220] I'll follow you Lord, no matter how far.
[time=236] Each day that I serve you you feel my every need.
[time=251] I'll follow you Lord, wherever you leave.
[time=265] To land far away Lord.
[time=273] I'll go there for you, wherever you live.
[time=281] If only a word step more.
[time=289] I'll go there too, wherever you live.
[time=298] I love your day, there's light since you came of all you Lord, wherever you leave.
[time=326] I'll follow you Lord, wherever you leave.
[time=343] I'll follow you Lord, no matter how far.
[time=358] Each day that I serve you you feel my every need.
[time=374] I'll follow you Lord, wherever you leave.
[time=537] We will say your true to the nations.
[time=542] For the heavens are from our home.
[time=546] Where all of us may be.
[time=550] Those I've come to true from our home.
[time=561] Lord, listen to his body.
[time=565] And the light in his name high.
[time=570] And her sleeping arms falls on you.
[time=575] I am the water and light.
[time=591] That story that we have to tell to the nations is referred to in scripture as the gospel.
[time=596] And that's the theme around which our memory verse for the week centers.
[time=599] If you would stand please and prepare to recite our memory verse for the week.
[time=603] If you're visiting with us we have that printed for you on the inside of the bolt down in the bottom left hand side.
[time=610] Romans 1 16.
[time=614] I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.
[time=624] First for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
[time=628] Romans 1 16. Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=658] [MUSIC - 65 seconds]
[time=750] We're glad that you're with us today for the Bible hour. Our pastor Rick Hawks is a way he's speaking in Michigan today.
[time=756] And this is missions month at Black Hawk Baptist Church and while there are many missions that we support on the field,
[time=763] many of them have come home and have spoken during the month of March.
[time=766] And we're really excited to hear of the reports of things that are happening around the world in missions.
[time=772] We also have a mission field right here at Black Hawk and in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=776] I'm delighted today to have on the administrator of our Christian School, Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=782] This is Steve Longbrake and welcome to the insert today, Steve.
[time=785] Good morning, Pete.
[time=786] We've had a very exciting year and it's been a very busy year with a lot of activities going on.
[time=791] In fact, just in the last week we've had a rather major activity as it relates to the school.
[time=796] Have we not?
[time=797] We sure have.
[time=798] This past week our students have been preparing for the school musical that is presented on March 25th and 26th.
[time=805] And it involves many of our students and a lot of their parents and we're looking forward to that performance.
[time=811] Well, it's exciting to see that we don't have a very large school but there's a lot of quality here and we're delighted in the special events that take place.
[time=818] You've had a very full year as it relates to the number of students and that always triggers one mind to say what's going to happen in the years to come.
[time=826] Have we got some ideas?
[time=827] We sure do.
[time=828] You know, I can't believe that it's been three quarters already passed.
[time=834] The school has one more nine weeks grading period to go and we have recently opened our enrollment up for next year.
[time=841] And the exciting thing is that for next year we have more students enrolled registered than we've ever had in the past.
[time=848] 350 people have already registered to put their students in our school.
[time=851] I'm really excited about that.
[time=852] Sounds like if anyone is interested, they better enroll or at least get information concerning next year's school year right away.
[time=860] That's right.
[time=861] In grades K through 10, if you are at all interested in our school, I anticipate that those grades will fill up and have a waiting list very quickly.
[time=869] So if you're interested, please call us at 4937400 or write at 7400 East State Street, Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=879] We'll be glad to send you information about that.
[time=881] Well, Steve, as I walk through the halls, it doesn't take you very long to realize that every room and every available space is being used throughout the day.
[time=890] If we're full in a few months as far as enrollment, what are our plans for the future as far as building is concerned?
[time=896] It's a lot of fun when people demand what you're offering.
[time=900] And we have plans now to try to build some extra classrooms, provide a new gymnasium, art lab, science lab, some other things that we need.
[time=908] And we'll be developing that as we expand the school.
[time=911] Next year, we plan to have a kindergarten that's twice the size that we've had in the past.
[time=916] And we're looking forward to adding a grade each year until our school is twice this size.
[time=920] Well, those of you that have been watching the Bible hour of late know that we have been following with great anticipation, the building of our new sanctuary.
[time=928] And right along with that, that means that we've got to begin planning for these classrooms for our students and even for our Sunday school and outreach year in the community of Fort Wayne.
[time=937] Well, that's very exciting.
[time=939] And you know, it not only takes students, Steve, but it takes a great group of teachers that need to help out.
[time=945] And we have a great staff here.
[time=947] We sure do.
[time=948] The Lord has blessed us so much here at our school.
[time=951] And for the first time we have a student, an alumni who has come back to teach here.
[time=956] That's been really nice this year to see her progress.
[time=959] She had a very good A grade point average in college and came back here, a licensed teacher, to teach in our Christian school.
[time=965] We're so thankful for those alumni.
[time=967] Many have had a lot of success and we're grateful for all our teachers.
[time=971] Our teachers are the backbone of the school.
[time=974] As they trust in the Lord and lean on him, they are faithful to carry out the things that he expects them to do with our kids.
[time=980] And they really make a difference.
[time=982] We only have one teacher leaving this year and that's really typical of our school.
[time=986] Our teachers have been here an average of eight years each and we're really grateful for that.
[time=990] I think I was most impressed with that statistic that the teachers stay here and I think that's indicative of their enjoyment of the school and their love for the program here.
[time=1000] And I'd like to compliment you as we close this segment of our insert saying that it's really important that we have an outstanding administrator
[time=1007] and we're definitely pleased that you're at Black Hawk Christian School, Steve.
[time=1010] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1011] I didn't expect that one this morning, but I appreciate it.
[time=1013] There are some other events coming up that we want to tell you about.
[time=1016] We'd like to invite you all to the downtown center in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1021] We'll be presenting a program there on Good Friday, April 1st at 1215.
[time=1027] It's a very short program, just a half hour, but we'd like to have those that are in the business world gather together right downtown
[time=1034] and we'll have some special music, some drama, and a brief message from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=1039] So if you have that time frame, it's Friday, April 1st at 1215 at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1046] And then we'd like to mention to you on April 3rd, that Sunday evening, Easter Sunday, we will be having a musical presentation here
[time=1053] by our guest musicians and the musicians from Black Hawk Baptist Church, our sanctuary choir.
[time=1059] It will be a meaningful time for you to come.
[time=1061] That's at 6 o'clock, April 3rd.
[time=1064] And then we've been talking about Hicks and Cohegan. Looking ahead to April 30th, that's a Friday evening.
[time=1071] We would like to extend to you an invitation. Tickets are now available for this dinner theater.
[time=1076] It's a time of relaxation, enjoyment, a lot of laughter will be there, and it'll be a great time.
[time=1082] So if you want information concerning that concert, you need to call the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 493 7400.
[time=1091] And then finally, we have been mentioning to you a pamphlet entitled Satisfaction by Joseph Aldrich.
[time=1098] Dr. Aldrich is the President of Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland, Oregon.
[time=1103] He's a great teacher, and this book will give you great satisfaction and encourage you in your Christian life.
[time=1109] And we'd like to have you write for it right now.
[time=1111] You can receive this pamphlet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1122] That's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1130] Once again, we'd like to thank you for joining us. Let's go back now to our live broadcast and listen to the musical ministry of Marilyn Wong.
[time=1145] I boast not at works or tell our good deeds, for not have I done to merit this grace.
[time=1173] Oh, glory and grace shall rest upon you.
[time=1184] Oh, will you to die in my place?
[time=1195] I will glory in the cross, in the cross lest his suffering of being here.
[time=1216] I will weep no more for the cross that he holds.
[time=1227] I will glory in the cross.
[time=1237] My trophies and crown, my robe stained with sin was all that I had to lay out in his feet.
[time=1261] Unworthy to read from the table of life until his love made provision.
[time=1282] I will glory in the cross, in the cross lest his suffering of being here.
[time=1302] I will weep no more for the cross that he bore.
[time=1313] I will glory in the cross.
[time=1323] I will weep no more for the cross that he bore.
[time=1333] I will glory in the cross.
[time=1371] As Christians, that's exactly what we have to glory in the cross.
[time=1376] Our speaker today is my privilege to introduce as a fellow servant, a faithful man of the Lord who loves him.
[time=1385] He's been that servant and he's gloryed in the cross for many years.
[time=1390] He's been for 13 years a missionary to Columbia with ABWE.
[time=1395] The last three and a half years he has served as the academic dean for the Word of Life Bible Institute in Argentina.
[time=1403] In addition to that, he's pastored.
[time=1405] If that weren't a full-time job enough, he's also pastored at a church there in Argentina as well.
[time=1410] Before I introduce him, though, you all know that for a man to be able to serve the Lord, he needs some important support.
[time=1418] That's the support of a loving, concerned, and caring wife and family.
[time=1422] I'd like to introduce and ask for you to stand please, his wife Janice and daughter Krista here with us.
[time=1429] Thank you for coming.
[time=1435] Pastor Don is going to be heading back and be serving in a slightly different capacity.
[time=1440] He will share with us a little more about that.
[time=1442] But he's going to be heading up a new ministry for Word of Life, a ministry to universities and to professionals.
[time=1450] In addition to that, he's going to be responsible for the publications ministry for Word of Life.
[time=1455] I'd like to ask you to welcome now to our podium, Pastor Don Fanning.
[time=1459] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1464] Thank you, I appreciate that.
[time=1466] We've been here quite a number of times.
[time=1469] Remember the first time I came, I preached over in the little auditorium that now a Sunday school class?
[time=1474] Next time, no telling where I'll be preaching, probably across the street.
[time=1478] What an exciting future Black Hawk Baptist Church has.
[time=1482] It's exciting for me to be able to see it in little spots like these rapid motions, things of a flower blooming,
[time=1492] just seeing in spots and seeing how it just goes so fast.
[time=1495] It's great to see what God is doing through you all, here in this community, and then through many of your outreaches all around the world.
[time=1503] One of those outreaches is our ministry that God has allowed us to be a part of Word of Life Ministries in South America.
[time=1511] We've just come through our camping season.
[time=1513] We live on the opposite side of the globe, so your wintertime is our summertime.
[time=1518] We've just finished summer camp.
[time=1520] We had 5,800 campers come through, and out of that 1,800 accepted Christ as their Savior.
[time=1527] What a thrill it was for us to see so many except the Lord Jesus as their Savior.
[time=1532] Yes, we intentionally go out of our way to invite the unsaved to come to our camp times.
[time=1539] In fact, we give many of them free weeks to come and spend a whole week with us, where they'll hear the gospel and be able to come under the influence of a gospel ministry and be able to commit their whole life to the Lord Jesus.
[time=1553] What a thrill it has been to see thousands really, not only accept the Lord, but later commit their whole life to the Lord.
[time=1560] Many of them have gone on to serve the Lord in all of the countries in South America.
[time=1565] In fact, now Word of Life Ministries has camp ministries, Bible club ministries,
[time=1572] and all of the countries in South America with the exception of Bolivia.
[time=1576] We're just praying now as God raises up the leader for a ministry in Bolivia.
[time=1580] That will soon be inaugurated.
[time=1583] We're just open Panama, Costa Rica, and Mexico.
[time=1586] And in these ministry, the combined evangelistic outreach of these ministries over this last year,
[time=1592] which is the first year, we've really begun to keep a composite of all of the results
[time=1598] of the evangelistic crusades and campaigns and camps.
[time=1601] And this year we had over 35,000 salvation decisions.
[time=1606] One of my ministries is writing, and I've written several follow-up discipleship ministries,
[time=1612] and one of them is a correspondence course.
[time=1615] And so now we're sending these out to all of those that have made decisions and begin to move them into a Bible correspondence relationship with Word of Life,
[time=1627] as well as encouraging them and all of the activities of Word of Life, which include Bible clubs and all the different churches, and encouraging them to continue on in the growth of their salvation decision in Christian life.
[time=1640] These are just a facet of some of the little things that God is continuing to do as he opens the doors.
[time=1646] We've begun a university ministry where we begin on a campus in the capital of the state of Buenos Aires, a large campus, a university town,
[time=1658] and Lord willing, this is going to be the initiation of an outreach that we believe is going to affect the leadership and future of the whole ministry of Word of Life,
[time=1669] and many other ministries.
[time=1671] This last year we, at the Missions Conference, when we gave the challenge to the students as to the commitment of their life,
[time=1679] one of the major challenges that we gave them was in the area of church planning.
[time=1683] We saw with the joy of a missionary in his heart,
[time=1689] we saw 217 of our students, of our 500 students, commit their lives to planning churches.
[time=1697] And now our job is the job of training these that have committed their heart in the area of church planning.
[time=1703] We work very closely in Argentina with ABWE, which is basically our sister mission in Argentina.
[time=1710] And as a result, last year we were able through our students and the leadership of a couple of the ABWE missionaries.
[time=1719] We saw seven new churches, totally new planet and new areas.
[time=1724] And this year, which starts in April, will be planting new churches from scratch,
[time=1730] 15 different churches with these that have committed their lives to church planning and under the leadership of senior students who have been involved in other ministries.
[time=1739] What an exciting potential of seeing a Bible Institute that draws from all quarters of Latin America,
[time=1746] they come from 17 different countries, seeing them during their training period involved right from the grassroots of planting churches, then to be able to go back to their own country.
[time=1756] We have about 40% of our students are from Argentina, 60% then come from other countries,
[time=1763] which come in to get the really exciting training that we offer there.
[time=1768] First week of every year, we have the open air camp painters come down and teach us and our students how to do open air campaigns, which is paintings and how to draw a crowd, how to control a small crowd and be able to present the gospel effectively in the open air.
[time=1784] And we cannot tell you the hundreds and hundreds of people that have accepted the Christ through this open air ministry.
[time=1791] But teaching our students how to be involved in evangelism and everybody's got to be involved in evangelism.
[time=1797] It's not just the optional thing, it's the ordinary thing for everyone.
[time=1802] And this then becomes a lifestyle that they can begin to communicate throughout all of their ministries.
[time=1808] One of my students came up to me one day and asked me, "Don, give me a message, give me a verse or an outline or something that I can go, they want me to preach now.
[time=1817] I want my whole church to just be evangelistic after I listen to this message." And I said, "Well, really, probably after your message, it isn't going to make a hill of beans." And he looked at me, "Huh, what do you mean?
[time=1829] One message ought to be able to do it." And I said, "No, it probably won't do it.
[time=1834] If you want to have an evangelistic church, it's probably going to take a commitment of about five to ten years as you take one man who might be interested in evangelism and begin to teach that one man.
[time=1847] And as you begin to share with him how to evangelize, then he begins to be effective in it, if after about six months or so, you see him actually able to win another person to Jesus Christ and feels comfortable in it, and he's ready to begin to train somebody else, then get somebody else involved in it.
[time=1866] But kind of go slow at it and let it grow and let it become something that's a lifestyle, a whole pattern of life of how to evangelize.
[time=1874] Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
[time=1877] A little different attitude.
[time=1880] But really, see, that's what we do in the Bible Institute.
[time=1883] We take them one-on-one and we show them how to preach, how to teach, open air one-on-one big campaigns and just show them an atmosphere of evangelism as they get their Bible training, and then they go out and leave a tremendously effective ministry.
[time=1900] One such young man has the name of Paolo Avagi,
[time=1907] is in Peru, Lima, Peru.
[time=1908] He's been there one year, first year in Lima, Peru.
[time=1911] You can imagine sitting an American down to Lima, Peru, with a first year missionary, never been to a foreign country before, and he's going in there, and what do you really expect from him from his first year on the field?
[time=1926] Well, Paolo led the taxi driver from the airport to his house to the Lord.
[time=1930] And that's how he got started.
[time=1932] Begin to win people in his neighborhood, kids that he met on the street, and in his first year on the field saw 5,300 people come to know Christ
[time=1941] through his ministry.
[time=1943] He was largely working through the Baptist ministries there in Lima, Peru.
[time=1947] Incredible.
[time=1948] Honestly, I cannot believe that I'm proud to be an American.
[time=1954] You understand that I'm proud of being American, but I can't believe that an American, or very few Americans, are going to be able to go into a country and have the impact of some well-trained, enthusiastic Latin is going to be able to do.
[time=1968] And that's the thrill of missions.
[time=1970] And we believe that that's the kind of thing that's going to leave the longest and most effective impact in South America.
[time=1978] So that's where we've committed our hearts in life, not only in training, but now just recently we were given the commitment of the publications ministries, and I can't begin to tell you the tremendous problem.
[time=1990] You know, you can go into a bookstore.
[time=1992] I would assume that we have perhaps even a bookstore here in the church and buy books reasonably priced.
[time=1999] But down there, the cost of a book is usually between $10 to $15.
[time=2003] A common -- a concordance, depending on the rate of exchange, but it can easily come up to about $70 just for a concordance.
[time=2012] The very common series of books, the Vine dictionary of New Testament words,
[time=2020] I think probably costs here maybe $10 or $12.
[time=2023] Down there cost $120.
[time=2026] It's terrible cost because they're all published on the exterior and have to be imported into the country.
[time=2033] So you've got shipping and importation and all kinds of other costs, plus somebody's got to make, you know, something to justify their existence.
[time=2041] And we would like to be able to go into a ministry of being able to produce study books and materials for church leaders
[time=2051] that would be much more economically priced in the $2 a book range that would be easily affordable to most anybody.
[time=2059] And to do this, we're going to have to have everything from computers, to presses and everything else.
[time=2065] And so this is one of the challenges that the Lord has given to me during these brief four months that we're home on furlough to try to raise up.
[time=2074] And we share that with you that you might really be praying that God's going to do something as He has begun to do in Latin America that is just going to be tremendously exciting.
[time=2086] It's one comment and then I would like to go to John chapter 15.
[time=2090] I believe we're in the last ages.
[time=2092] And if you study and believe Revelation chapter 2 verses chapter 2 and 3,
[time=2098] to be the seven churches that symbolically can portray the entire church period,
[time=2105] the last two churches, not just the layer to see in church, but the last two churches go all the way to the end.
[time=2114] That is that the church from Philadelphia also is going to go all the way to the rapture because it's in chapter 3 verse 10 that the promise of the rapture is given to the Philadelphia church, meaning that they're going to go all the way to the end.
[time=2128] Now that means that's somewhat kind of exciting to me.
[time=2131] I don't have to be a part of the layout of seeing church, the cold, dead, clammy church of dead orthodoxy, but can be something that can really be full of vitality and dynamism as we see the doors opening opportunities that have never before been given
[time=2148] opening for evangelism.
[time=2150] And that's what we're seeing in Latin America.
[time=2153] One of our missionaries, Paolo Lavagio is the one that really started it, happened to go to a local school and ask if he couldn't come into the local school and present the message, the evangelical message of the gospel to the students,
[time=2168] just perhaps for curiosity so that they at least have heard it and know what the evangelicals are all about.
[time=2175] Oh, that's a pretty good idea.
[time=2178] They ought to know what's going on with evangelicals, so inviting them to come in.
[time=2182] And then one after another, and then the kids started accepting Christ and it just began to mushroom, then into Chile, the same thing, the doors in Chile are open to the gospel as in no other South American country.
[time=2196] Incredible the opportunities that have been afforded us in Chile.
[time=2200] And one week our ensemble and evangelist Joe Jordan went to Chile,
[time=2207] and in one week 3,500 people accepted Christ in their campaigns.
[time=2212] They had six meetings every day, understanding different places.
[time=2216] I mean, they were working during that week to say the least.
[time=2220] But when they have a meeting you understand they don't sit down.
[time=2223] They'll have 500 students or so that come out from the schools and they stand in attention in an open air.
[time=2230] All in little lines, nobody can move around, can't sit down, and they stand as they listen to the gospel.
[time=2237] And then they come forward during the invitation and what a thrill to see folks who have never heard the gospel come to know Jesus Christ is their Savior.
[time=2245] Well that's what Word of Life Ministries are all about.
[time=2247] In a nutshell I've tried to draw it all together and hope I haven't confused it too much, throwing different countries at you.
[time=2253] But it's exciting like I have never dreamed that could happen in South America.
[time=2259] Be praying, please for Argentina, especially for Word of Life, pray especially for Peru.
[time=2265] Peru and Colombia are probably the two countries in South America that desperately need your prayers.
[time=2270] Politically they are in very difficult situations.
[time=2274] In 1989 there are going to be elections in Peru and it's very, very likely that the Communists will take over in that country and we do not know what's going to mean for missions in the future.
[time=2288] And this is the same in Colombia, very, very serious days.
[time=2293] But the folks that are continuing in those countries are facing tremendous opposition.
[time=2298] But with the courage of a Joshua or Caleb they're being willing to face tremendous enemies and continuing to preach the gospel.
[time=2306] John chapter 15.
[time=2308] John chapter 15, we find in the last message of our Lord, before the crucifixion on the following day, is he's meeting with them in this final evening, giving them some instructions.
[time=2321] Many of them apparently knew instructions that he perhaps had waited for his entire ministry to communicate.
[time=2328] At the same time we find in John from chapter 12 all the way through chapter 17,
[time=2334] some of the content of that last evening's instruction.
[time=2338] You can imagine what that would mean receiving that type of instruction on a nightly basis.
[time=2344] Spending time with the Lord Jesus was not just, "Oh, I wonder how the Cardinals are doing
[time=2350] and whoever else might be playing in their football teams or whatever." I mean, they were jammed packed with special teaching content
[time=2361] and those men had received so much that it was physically impossible to remember everything.
[time=2368] So that in John chapter 14 and John chapter 16, the Lord Jesus gives them a promise of the comforter who would come.
[time=2375] One of the ministries of the Holy Spirit that would come would be that they would be able to recall all that Jesus taught them throughout that three-year period.
[time=2385] In other words, humanly speaking, they couldn't possibly have remembered it.
[time=2389] And one of the assurances that we have of the inspiration of this book is the fact that the Holy Spirit did not depend on the memory of those men who had spent time with Jesus, but that he through the ministry of the revelation given to them and then the inspiration as they pinned what they remembered that the Holy Spirit enlivened as they begin to write, "Give us in our accurate account of the Word of God exactly what Jesus taught
[time=2417] and all of the information necessary for us for knowing the will of God in our life."
[time=2424] And that is vital for us to understand that the Holy Spirit used those men by the promise of one of the ministries of the comforter that would come to give us the Word of God.
[time=2436] And there's nothing that Jesus taught that we lack.
[time=2440] It's all recorded for us here.
[time=2443] Approach the Word of God in that vein.
[time=2446] Now listen as I read from verse 12 through verse 16.
[time=2450] This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you.
[time=2456] Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends.
[time=2461] You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you.
[time=2465] Henceforth I call you not servants for the servant north not what his Lord doeth.
[time=2471] But I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father
[time=2477] I have made known unto you.
[time=2480] You have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain.
[time=2489] And that whatsoever you ask of the Father in my name he may give it you.
[time=2494] What an encouragement to us.
[time=2497] But what an invitation to us.
[time=2500] It's an invitation to be a friend of Jesus.
[time=2506] Now I want you to kind of see the transition in this.
[time=2510] Not everybody in the Bible was called a servant of God.
[time=2514] As a matter of fact in the Bible there's only two people called a servant of God.
[time=2519] Now Paul calls himself a servant of God.
[time=2522] But there's only two people that God called a servant of God.
[time=2526] And they are Moses and Joshua at the close of their ministries.
[time=2531] At the close of their lives they're called servants of God.
[time=2536] Now that's quite a compliment to be called a servant of God.
[time=2539] It's sort of an epitaph put on somebody for their tremendous faithfulness and their tremendous obedience to everything that God told them in the process of their life.
[time=2552] And then we find another term introduced here the idea of a friend.
[time=2558] Now it's interesting likewise in the whole testament only one person is called a friend of God.
[time=2565] And that was Abraham and that mentioned in Isaiah that's then repeated in James that same verse.
[time=2573] And we find that that is a tremendous title given to very few people.
[time=2578] Now we're beginning to see that being a servant implies a willingness to be obedient
[time=2587] to whatever instruction that a person might receive directly from God.
[time=2594] And then to be a friend is a little bit different.
[time=2597] Let me paint the idea for you and see if we can't as we read the passage again see this idea.
[time=2604] I believe the idea of a friend is more than being a servant.
[time=2610] The idea being a friend is a willingness to do what one knows your friend needs without having to be told what he wants you to do.
[time=2623] There's a story told of a sergeant in the police force in Los Angeles who was killed in the line of duty.
[time=2632] And before he died he had laid out elaborate plans for a garden in his backyard.
[time=2639] And that garden included tears and bushes and railroad ties.
[time=2645] I mean it was quite an undertaking to build this tremendous garden in his backyard.
[time=2652] And he had just begun when trying to stop a robbery he stopped a bullet and died.
[time=2660] All of his friends, knowing what was the real desire of his heart, never having been asked to do so.
[time=2668] Willingly begin to contribute their day off their own personal funds and order that desire of their friend could be fulfilled.
[time=2679] Now those guys were genuine friends of their body.
[time=2684] Now that's what's interesting to me is that the Lord Jesus has given us a lot of directives in the Word of God.
[time=2692] And what he desires of us is simply that we begin to absorb this communication of his will into our life.
[time=2702] And just because he's our friend, desire to communicate this to others.
[time=2710] My question to you is it's wonderful that Jesus is our friend.
[time=2715] And I say we sing what a friend we have in Jesus.
[time=2718] That is just great.
[time=2721] But my question to you has to be today, you know, are we really a friend of Jesus?
[time=2730] Look in this passage in the verse verse that he says, and this is my commandment,
[time=2736] that you love one another as I have loved you.
[time=2739] I was once in a group of preacher boys, about a thousand preacher boys, and one in a question and answer time, and one of them asked me this question, "Don, if you were going to die in just one minute, tell us the one message you would give that would just contain it all." And I said, "Well, I kind of put you on a spot, you know, thinking about that all the time." And I said, "Well, the only thing I could think of that would really just be kind of put it all into one nut
[time=2770] that you love one another." And you have to understand in fundamental circles, that's usually not the message that you're going to hear, but it was the one message that I believe
[time=2781] was the whole essence of the life of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2785] You know, if this church could just learn to love one another, to a point that you begin to communicate that love in tangible, effective ways
[time=2797] in which you actually felt that love, I believe this church could even be greater.
[time=2805] I mean, it could have a greater impact, and I know you do love each other here, but I know also that Christians have a real frustration with a lot of other Christians, and learning to genuinely love someone is not easy.
[time=2819] But Jesus tells us here very clearly that the command is to learn to love one another.
[time=2827] That means being willing to forgive one another.
[time=2830] That means willing to be able to give to one another one that a person needs.
[time=2834] That means being sensitive to one another's.
[time=2837] That means not gossiping about other people.
[time=2839] That means being sensitive to not destroy another person.
[time=2843] That means being able to build each other up.
[time=2846] That means being willing to get involved in helping somebody else.
[time=2851] You know, those are vital lessons that I think first have to be learned in the home.
[time=2856] I think secondly have to be learned in community.
[time=2860] That is in your church, in the people that you come in contact with.
[time=2865] The tremendous lessons and the risks that are involved in getting close to somebody.
[time=2873] But hey, that's where ministry really begins to take place.
[time=2878] There are people that come here that will never be able to touch.
[time=2882] But as you can touch, people come through these doors and they're hungry, they're needy.
[time=2888] They need somebody here to care for them.
[time=2892] I challenge you to learn to be able to learn to love.
[time=2895] I remember somebody visited a church and came to tell me the story of what happened on their visit.
[time=2901] They walked, they got out of their car, somebody walking by, introduced themselves from the parking lot.
[time=2907] They began to just be friendly from the parking lot.
[time=2910] They began to talk to them, found out what Sunday school they were going to and everything.
[time=2913] This was just an ordinary member and took them to their Sunday school and they introduced them especially in their Sunday school.
[time=2919] I mean, made a big deal of them.
[time=2921] Made them really feel important in their Sunday school.
[time=2924] Come to church and somebody met them in church and we began to talk to them and found out what their name was, where they worked.
[time=2930] They said, "Hey, I know somebody that works there and took him over to meet somebody else that worked in the same plant where this guy worked."
[time=2936] And only that then later talked to him and said, "Listen, before you go, did you share with me one knee that I can pray for for you this week?
[time=2944] I really want to pray for you." And then somebody else invited him to dinner right after church, first time I'd ever go into that church.
[time=2952] I mean, it wasn't anything planned.
[time=2954] But it's just spontaneous commitment to people.
[time=2958] That's the lessons that have got to be learned in a local church.
[time=2962] If somebody goes out into the ministry, goes to the mission field and hasn't learned those lessons, hasn't experienced that kind of a local church, his church is going to be as dead and as cold as the majority of the American churches.
[time=2979] That you learn to love one another.
[time=2982] That's the commandment he gave us.
[time=2985] And watch what he says there.
[time=2987] "You are my friends if you do whatever I command you."
[time=2995] No, it's interesting, isn't it?
[time=2997] That a servant is somebody who doesn't know what is going on, but is told to do a job and does a job.
[time=3006] You know, you can always tell in a big job when somebody is getting ready to become a foreman or move up into the scale.
[time=3013] Somebody who's always going to be on the labor scale, labor level, is somebody who has to be told everything that he has to do.
[time=3022] And generally, they'll do a good job if they're told specifically what they have to do.
[time=3028] But they generally don't do anything except what they are specifically told to do.
[time=3033] This is a laborer.
[time=3036] But when we move up into a foreman's level, the guys that get picked to be foreman are not only those that do what they're told to do, but they begin to get a picture of the broader scope and begin to understand that, well, he didn't tell me to do this, but I know it has to be done, so I'll make sure that it gets done.
[time=3055] Now you begin to change your attitude, change your mind, your frame of mind.
[time=3061] And this is the attitude that Jesus is trying to encourage in his disciples.
[time=3065] I'm not going to be with you, he's telling them, to tell you everything that you're going to be able to do.
[time=3071] But if you're going to learn to be my friend, just take everything that I've shared with you and begin to put it into practice in your life.
[time=3080] You just begin to do it. Without my having to tell you specifically, it's written, just do it.
[time=3087] Now that's the attitude that Christ wants to mold into our lives.
[time=3093] We become so terribly mystical sometimes.
[time=3096] It's incredible once I was sitting at a table talking to this lady.
[time=3100] Very interesting lady.
[time=3103] And I'll just share with you one aspect of the conversation.
[time=3107] But in the midst we were talking back and forth about different ideas of knowing Christ.
[time=3112] All of a sudden she goes, "Huh?
[time=3115] Okay, I'll tell him, I'll tell him Jesus." And then we kept on talking.
[time=3122] And then just a little bit later all of a sudden she goes, "Huh?" "Yeah, right, yeah, just one minute, I'll get him." And I said, "Who are you talking to?" She said, "Jesus, he's right there, don't you see him?" And I said, "No, I don't see him." So people that really know Jesus, they see him a lot.
[time=3148] This mysticism is not only invading much of Christianity.
[time=3154] Believe me, it is just pure mysticism, it is not reality.
[time=3160] It's imagination.
[time=3162] God doesn't communicate to us in that fashion.
[time=3166] He tells us in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 that in former times, especially through the prophets,
[time=3174] he did speak invasions and dreams and other manifestations.
[time=3179] But now it's through his son, it says in Hebrews chapter 1.
[time=3184] And in John chapter 16 it says, "Then his son speaks to us through the apostles as the Holy Spirit
[time=3190] recalls what he taught them and they then pin it and write it.
[time=3195] And the way he speaks to us today is through his word, not in some mystical experience."
[time=3203] And I say this has really influenced us a lot, even in the area of missions.
[time=3208] Because there's many people that have refused or not considered seriously going to especially
[time=3215] the foreign field simply because they have not heard the call of God.
[time=3221] They have not sensed that God is speaking to them about that.
[time=3227] Believe me, brethren, that is totally irrelevant.
[time=3231] God has spoken and he desires that every one of you be committed to world of angelism
[time=3239] equally as much as anyone who happens to go.
[time=3243] I'm not saying that all of you will go.
[time=3246] But I'm saying every one of you should be equally committed to it.
[time=3251] And every day you should be equally praying and burdened, giving that God would by his grace reach out and touch this entire globe with a gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3268] Do you want to be a friend? You've got to think like he does.
[time=3273] You've got to have on your heart what was on his heart.
[time=3278] That's a friend.
[time=3282] When my wife and I were married, first night of our wedding, a lot of things happened.
[time=3289] I don't want to share too many of them.
[time=3292] We lay down. She had a childhood habit where her foot would begin to wiggle like this.
[time=3303] And I said, Jan, that's got to go.
[time=3309] And from that night, it went.
[time=3313] Because she knew that it couldn't keep me apart of her life if we were going to really be friends.
[time=3322] Because it would be constantly irritating, constantly frustrating me.
[time=3328] And it left.
[time=3330] Now I'll confess to you, I've done that often in my life to her.
[time=3334] Lots of things I did had to go in order for us to build our relationship.
[time=3340] You see that that's what it's all about, growth in the Lord Jesus.
[time=3344] As you go into the book, you discover things that, hey, I'm not thinking that way, I've got to change.
[time=3351] I've got to begin to think differently.
[time=3354] Because I want to be his friend.
[time=3357] And the reason I go to the book is because I want to be his friend.
[time=3362] He's my friend, totally committed to me.
[time=3367] And I want to be his friend.
[time=3369] I want him to consider me his friend.
[time=3375] Look in this passage, if you will now, in verse 15.
[time=3379] Since henceforth, I'll not call you servants for the servant, Noah, not what the Lord doeth.
[time=3385] You see the difference?
[time=3387] Some people don't do anything unless they're told to do it.
[time=3390] Well, that's the laborer.
[time=3393] But God wants you to move from that stage and your growth in Christ to a stage where you know what he wants without him having to tell you.
[time=3404] That's the stage of friendship.
[time=3408] But here I have called you friends.
[time=3411] All things that I have heard of my father are made known unto you.
[time=3414] Verse 16, "And you have not chosen me, but I have chosen you." My, I don't understand. I thought I chose him.
[time=3422] But later I discover he chose me.
[time=3425] And it wasn't by accident that he chose me.
[time=3428] It was on purpose.
[time=3430] It wasn't by accident that you came to know Jesus Christ.
[time=3432] It was on purpose.
[time=3434] If you know him in your heart today, it's because he has a purpose for your life.
[time=3440] That purpose is here delineated.
[time=3442] That you'd go.
[time=3443] That you'd bring forth fruit.
[time=3445] And that your fruit should remain.
[time=3447] Going and just getting a decision is not enough.
[time=3450] It's very important that you go.
[time=3452] It's very important that you get a decision.
[time=3454] That you make someone, see somebody except Christ as their Savior.
[time=3458] But you've got to be committed to that person and make sure that that fruit remains.
[time=3463] Because then you begin to develop the mentality of Jesus and the mind of Christ begins to be your mind.
[time=3470] And that's what happens to fulfill the latter part of this verse.
[time=3475] So then whatever you ask of the Father in my name, I'll give it to you.
[time=3480] Because you see you're thinking just like I think.
[time=3484] We had Sophie Mueller come to Argentina and give a challenge.
[time=3491] I trust that God will challenge you through her words.
[time=3495] When she gave this challenge, it was incredible.
[time=3499] Because a few years before, one of our graduates, Ramon Rivas, had gone to Colombia.
[time=3505] The first person to go to Colombia to work with Sophie Mueller.
[time=3509] The Gao won on the streets of New York City by Jack Wertzen.
[time=3514] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of Rejoice,
[time=3525] Biola's David Johnson and Vocal soloist Marilyn Wong.
[time=3529] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3537] Will you bow and pray?
[time=3539] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3546] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me and to save me.
[time=3552] I ask you to come in today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed this prayer, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3562] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3570] To receive a copy of "Your Decision" or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled Satisfaction, please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
