[time=0] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=120] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us. Our special guest speaker today is Larry Smith, Missionary to Jamaica.
[time=131] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us. Special music today includes a song from the Sanctuary Choir and a number from the Handbell Choir.
[time=145] Other special music includes a song from the Black Hawk Singers and Brian Losen.
[time=153] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=162] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you. Now, here's Rick.
[time=170] Thank you for your singing this morning of that name of Jesus. The Apostle Peter said, "Neither is their salvation given under any other name but the name of Jesus."
[time=183] We've come to worship Him today and we're so thankful that you're here today to lift our voices together and praise.
[time=190] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour. We have met today because in life like the seasons, change is inevitable.
[time=202] But we're looking for that on which we can build our life that never changes a solid rock.
[time=209] And Jesus said, "Whoever hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who builds his house upon a rock."
[time=219] The choir ministers to us this morning in singing of that theme, Jesus Christ as the solid rock of life.
[time=249] They tear the trust to sweetest spring.
[time=253] God, holy, Lord Jesus, sing on Christ the solid rock of life.
[time=263] They stand all over God, they sing, he stand.
[time=272] When darkness fails his lovely face, I rest on his unchanging grace.
[time=287] In every high and stormy hill, my anchor holds within the bid.
[time=301] For Christ as the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking down.
[time=315] In every high and stormy hill, I stand all over God, holy, Lord Jesus Christ as the solid rock of life.
[time=330] For Christ as the solid rock I stand all over God, holy, Lord Jesus Christ as the solid rock of life.
[time=359] In every high and stormy hill, I stand all over God, holy, Lord Jesus Christ as the solid rock of life.
[time=389] God, holy, Lord Jesus the solid rock, holy, Lord Jesus Christ as the solid rock of life.
[time=408] We were marking as we rehearsed this song that we remember well the chorus that began with the foolish man building his house upon the sand
[time=416] and the house fell flat.
[time=418] As Rick mentioned, the wise man built his house upon the rock and the house stood firm.
[time=424] The rock being the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=426] Our message today is look and live.
[time=428] My brother live, look to Jesus now and live.
[time=431] 360, we'll sing the first, second and fourth stanzas together.
[time=442] I am the message of the Lord of the Lord.
[time=458] My brother live, look to Jesus now and live.
[time=474] I am the message of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord of the Lord.
[time=492] My brother live, look to Jesus now and live.
[time=506] It is only that you look and live.
[time=522] My brother live, look to Jesus now and live.
[time=548] It is only that you look and live.
[time=561] During this month of March, we are emphasizing the worldwide responsibility that each of us have as believers to be ambassadors for Christ.
[time=572] In our culture, we call that missions. God has given each one of us a mission in life.
[time=579] My very purpose in life, apart from my occupation, is to tell people about Jesus Christ.
[time=586] Your mission in life, if you know him as Savior today, is to tell others about him.
[time=592] During March, we emphasize that mission, that responsibility to be ambassadors for Christ.
[time=598] We have as our guest today some career missionaries the Smiths who come to us from Jamaica.
[time=605] Larry and Maria have been serving there for three years and Bill Culp, Bob Dick and Dick Kelly and I have the privilege of visiting them in Jamaica last month.
[time=615] The snow came down this morning and I thought maybe we should go there today instead of having the Smiths here.
[time=621] We couldn't take all of you with us, but we will be taking 30 of you with us to go there this summer to help the Smiths to establish yet another church in Jamaica.
[time=631] Larry and Maria, would you come and join me? We would like for you friends to meet these dear friends.
[time=637] You may know Mike and Nancy Smith and our church. Mike is their son and is a partner with us in ministry here in Fort Wayne.
[time=645] Welcome to Blackhawk and Maria, just tell us a little bit about Jamaican and what you've been doing there.
[time=650] Well, we've been in, as the pastor said, about three years, a little more than three years, and we're church planners.
[time=659] We planted churches in the United States for about 27 and the Lord gave us the privilege to go over season.
[time=666] I know that you don't believe that we're that old, but we really are. My husband's that old.
[time=671] God has been very good to us. We have established the Calvary Baptist Church in Mandeville and the Sivu Baptist Church in Bolsevanna, which is in St. Elizabeth Parish.
[time=681] And we're very anxious for the group to come in June of this year, hoping that we will be able to put church number three on the map in a little area called Knock Patrick, which is located not far from Mandeville.
[time=696] God has been very good to us. We were so delighted this morning when we woke up and saw the snow on the ground to leave 85 degree temperature and to come here and see snowflakes was just more than we could take.
[time=713] Well, I'm certainly glad to find somebody who enjoyed that today. Larry, how can we help you? We're coming down 30 people in June. What can we do that would help?
[time=726] Well, we appreciate the visit from your pastor and the other three, and we kind of planned out some things and we have several things lined up where they can be a very integral part of our ministry down there that the Lord has given to us.
[time=741] The first thing we want to do is to have a week of tent meetings in Knock Patrick.
[time=746] That'll be church number three, and we'll be able to do that with all the good material we have to work with, and we're looking forward to that.
[time=755] We have been praying about another Jamaican pastor to come in and take that work and charge so we can work with them.
[time=761] We work with Jamaican pastors in planning churches so that when we leave, the church is established in the Jamaican culture as well as in their own with one of their own men leading.
[time=772] Secondly, we have some clinks that we're setting up in the various parts of the country where there's a lot of health problems and things like that, and so the doctors will be very helpful there and the nurses.
[time=782] We're going to do leaflet evangelism. We'll be doing some, what we call storefront evangelism back off the main roads.
[time=790] We have these little places you would call shacks, but they sell bread, flour, and things of that nature to meet the daily needs of the people, and they let us have a loudspeaker hooked up to their electricity and preached there at night, and so we'll be doing some of that
[time=804] and having concerts and be multiple ministries that they'll perform that will really have a great input in the ministry in Jamaica for the glory of Jesus Christ.
[time=815] Larry and Maria, thanks for letting the four of us come down and the group of us come down to share in your work there, and we'd like to invite you to pray with us now.
[time=825] Father, we are so thankful for the churches that have been started and the men and women who at this very moment are worshiping you there.
[time=832] We rejoice to know we have brothers and sisters in the kingdom.
[time=836] We pray this morning for Pastor Paul Neil and for Pastor David Gransden as they share your word today that your spirit would use them to declare your word.
[time=846] We pray that there might be people who come to Christ today there and hear that your kingdom might grow.
[time=853] Thank you for these dear friends and bringing us in partnership together. We ask your blessing on their lives in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=862] Thank you, Larry and Maria. The scriptures tell us that we serve a great God and that He is a holy God, and our Belkwire plays for us, that majestic anthem, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[time=883] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=1028] Again, we want to welcome you to the Bible Hour. Each Sunday morning, we come in a few moments early and record these brief minutes for you who join us by way of television.
[time=1039] Right now, here, we're making a few announcements about junior high activities and things like that and taking our offering.
[time=1047] And we've recorded these moments so we can talk directly with you friends who are part of our television family.
[time=1053] And we like to share some special events coming up to include you. And we do have some special events coming up with Easter and Good Friday and the Hicks & Cohegan concert, a lot happening.
[time=1064] That's right, Rick. It just seems like when you make that transition into the spring of the year, it's an exciting time, not only because of the changes in the foliage and so forth, but it's just a revival time for us to get started again.
[time=1078] And we are excited about the events that are coming up in our church. I want to talk first about our Easter Sunday evening service on April 3rd.
[time=1086] Rick, we're just going to combine a lot of our soloists and ensembles, and the choir is going to do a number of numbers, as well as some monologues, just depicting the Easter story, and we're going to entitle it Jesus Lives, just celebrating the wonderful resurrection of our Savior.
[time=1103] And it's going to be a great evening reflecting on that event.
[time=1106] Well, I know that our people here will look forward to that, and we want to include you.
[time=1111] It's an evening of worship and a praise, a lot of energy, but most of all, celebration that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1119] We also have a Good Friday service. We leave our building here and head downtown into the heart of our city at the Grand Wayne Center and have a Good Friday service on April 1st.
[time=1131] The service is held over the lunch hour from 1215 to 1245.
[time=1136] It's a half hour that will include music, drama, and a study of God's Word.
[time=1141] That's a lot to pack into a half hour, so it's a high energy, but it's a challenging time for us to consider the Lord Jesus Christ and the fact that He actually did die for us.
[time=1152] So we want to encourage you to come on Good Friday at 1215 to the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1158] And then we have the Hicks & Co-Eggin concert coming up at the end of the month of April.
[time=1162] Another exciting time, Hicks & Co-Eggin will be with us on April 30th.
[time=1166] That's a dinner theater type evening with our dinner at 6.30, and then these two young men really present a very exhilarating evening.
[time=1175] They combine humor with some serious thoughts about the Christian life and really get us going as far as our laughter, and yet at the same time,
[time=1185] they project an image of some really important aspects of the Christian life and make us think about it.
[time=1190] It's a wonderful evening. I really encourage anyone that is out there to set aside that time.
[time=1195] And Rick, our tickets, as people are viewing, are available today. That's March 20th.
[time=1201] And you can call the church office or stop by here at 7400E state and reserve your tickets.
[time=1209] And the tickets are reserved. Each table has a number of people where you can reserve it.
[time=1214] Great. Today we have a booklet that I'm excited to share with you.
[time=1218] It has the simple one-word title, Satisfaction.
[time=1222] This is a book that I think may be the most appropriate booklet for us to share with you.
[time=1229] As I meet people every day, and I certainly do that, and they begin to open up their heart, no matter who they are, no matter what walk of life, no matter what stature, no matter what income,
[time=1240] they open up and tell me how they are lacking satisfaction in their life.
[time=1247] The author is Joe Aldrich, and he is a great communicator of God's Word, and he's done an excellent job in this booklet.
[time=1255] He begins with this illustration. If you move up from a $75,000 home to a $150,000 home,
[time=1264] do you double your satisfaction in life? Think about that.
[time=1270] In reality, most of us realize very quickly that what we double are our expenses, but our satisfaction usually does not increase at all.
[time=1279] What is it that gives satisfaction? I'm not going to tell you the whole plot. We want you to write for the booklet.
[time=1285] And if you will write, we'll send it to you free as a gift and an encouragement from us to you.
[time=1290] While this is on your mind, let me encourage you to write for the pamphlet entitled Satisfaction.
[time=1295] When you write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1304] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1313] Thank you, Pete. Before we go back to our morning worship service, I would like to ask you to join me in praying for some dear friends of mine and of yours.
[time=1323] It's the Cignlin family. Now, you say, "I don't know that I know the Cignlin family." Well, Dale Cignlin has from day one been the producer and the director of the Bible Hour.
[time=1334] And each of us, you and me both, appreciate and enjoy his ministry each time we watch the Bible Hour.
[time=1341] We're asking you to pray for Dale, his family, particularly his father, Roy, as Dale's mother went home to be with the Lord just this past Tuesday.
[time=1350] And so, if you would pray with me for the family of Florence Cignlin, we would certainly appreciate that.
[time=1356] Now, we go back to our morning worship service and trust that God will use these moments together to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1372] He promised us that He would be a councilor, a mighty God and a prince of peace.
[time=1386] He promised us that He would be a father, and He would love us with a love that would not cease.
[time=1400] Well, I tried Him and I found His promises are true.
[time=1407] He's everything He said that He would be.
[time=1414] The finest words I know could not begin to tell.
[time=1421] Just how much Jesus really means to me.
[time=1430] For He's more wonderful than my mind can be seen.
[time=1441] He's more wonderful than my heart can believe.
[time=1448] He goes beyond my heart His hopes and thunder's dreams.
[time=1462] He's everything that my soul had belonged for, everything He's promised and so much more.
[time=1476] More than amazing, more than marvelous, more than miraculous will ever be.
[time=1489] He's more than wonderful.
[time=1493] That's what Jesus is to me.
[time=1506] I stand amazed to think the King of glory,
[time=1518] would come to live within the heart of man.
[time=1525] I marvel just to know He really loves me.
[time=1532] And I think of who He is and who I am.
[time=1541] For He's more wonderful than my mind can be seen.
[time=1551] He's more wonderful than my heart can believe.
[time=1558] He moves beyond my highest hopes and thunder's dreams.
[time=1571] He's everything that my soul had belonged for, everything He's promised and so much more.
[time=1585] More than amazing, more than marvelous, more than miraculous will ever be.
[time=1598] He's more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me.
[time=1617] He's everything that my soul had belonged for, everything He's promised and so much more.
[time=1632] More than amazing, more than marvelous, more than miraculous will ever be.
[time=1645] He's more than wonderful, more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me.
[time=1665] He's more than wonderful to me, to me.
[time=1695] Jesus is more than wonderful, and I hope that you've taken time this week to memorize our verse which talks about the very attitude that Jesus had and the attitude that we are to emulate.
[time=1708] Please stand now as we recite our memory verse for today.
[time=1711] If you're visiting with us, you can find that verse inside your bulletin.
[time=1716] Matthew 2028, "Just as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many."
[time=1729] Matthew 2028, thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1742] Love of friend and lover is often sweetly sung, but no greater love than the Savior's love can be told by mortal time.
[time=1767] There is no greater love than the Christ above.
[time=1779] That made Him stoop to earth become a man, and by His death provide redemption's plan.
[time=1793] There is no greater love, that's why I'm singing of.
[time=1805] God's love so rich and free, reveal that Calvary, there is no greater love.
[time=1828] If He had died for angels or cherubim on high, we could understand, but amazed we'd stand, that for sinners lost, He died.
[time=1854] There is no greater love than that of Christ above.
[time=1866] That made Him stoop to earth become a man, and by His death provide redemption's plan.
[time=1879] There is no greater love, that's why I'm singing of.
[time=1891] God's love so rich and free, reveal that Calvary, there is no greater love.
[time=1907] There is no greater love, that's why I'm singing of.
[time=1919] God's love so rich and free, reveal that Calvary, there is no greater love.
[time=1949] Thank you, Brian. We certainly appreciate a song that so clearly tells us of God's grace and goodness to us.
[time=1957] I'd like to invite you to bow before our God in prayer.
[time=1962] Father, we bow our head and close our eyes to say to you that we recognize your Lord, and we want to exclusively put our attention on you.
[time=1973] And we invite you today and ask you to speak to us in the inner person.
[time=1982] We ask your spirit to talk to our spirit through your word and through the one who would share your word with us this morning.
[time=1992] God, we want to know you, our heart, our soul longs for satisfaction or anxious to be filled.
[time=2002] We're like a cup that's drawing near empty, and we ask you today to take our cup, to fill it up, to come and to quench this thirsting of our souls.
[time=2020] And God, we ask you to do more than that. We ask you to particularly comfort and encourage those who have lost loved ones in recent days.
[time=2030] For Dale Siglin and his family and the death of his mother, for Gwen Keaton and her family and the death of her grandmother.
[time=2040] We'd pray today for Eleanor Lehman and her family as she battles cancer in a severe stage.
[time=2048] God, we ask you to comfort each one.
[time=2051] We ask you to provide for those who have lost jobs or who are underemployed.
[time=2057] We ask you to give perspective to each of us as we labor today.
[time=2063] In this life, there are prospective reflect that we know there's a next life.
[time=2069] Now, again, we ask you to speak to us through your word. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2076] It is our privilege today to have the Smiths with us and for Larry to open up the scriptures in his heart and to challenge us with God's word.
[time=2086] And it's a privilege to welcome him to Blackhawk. Larry, thank you for your ministry here today.
[time=2091] Thank you, Pastor Hawk. We appreciate the privilege of being with you.
[time=2095] We bring greetings from 85 degree temperatures in Jamaica.
[time=2100] Isn't that a challenge to the mission field? I just love it. I wish I were there.
[time=2108] My wife may like the snow, but I don't.
[time=2112] Okay, let's turn in our Bibles this morning, if you will, please, to Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12 is our text.
[time=2120] It says, "For the word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder
[time=2128] of the soul and the spirit of the joints and the marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart."
[time=2136] And another translation says in the attitudes and the motives.
[time=2140] Life is like a coin.
[time=2144] You can spend it any way you wish, but you can only spend it once.
[time=2149] God has been trying over the years to call out a people for His namesake to love and to fellowship with and to provide for.
[time=2158] And I wonder today if God would speak to your heart, and He would say to you, I want you to leave your warm home, your good job,
[time=2169] and move out to some place where I want you to just spend the rest of your life for me at any age.
[time=2178] Age is no limit with God. You're never too old and you're never too young to serve.
[time=2184] I wonder if you'd come up with the same about 40 excuses that other Christians do, or if you'd say, "Here, my Lord, I'm ready to go. I'm an eager beaver."
[time=2195] Israel, in our context of the lesson this morning, was very disobedient to God.
[time=2204] They were unable to grasp ahold of the great things and hang on to what God had done for them.
[time=2210] God had made a promise, now you go into the land and possess it.
[time=2215] Earlier on, He had sent out some spies and there were 12 of them, and 10 of them got to the land as they were spying it out,
[time=2223] and they looked out to the eyes of man and they saw that there were giants there.
[time=2229] All they could see was giants. Giants, giants, they were looking through the eyes of man.
[time=2235] And the other two spies saw the same thing, but they looked beyond the giants, and they saw the great big grapes,
[time=2242] and they saw the promises of God, and they saw that God would be able to take care of the giants.
[time=2248] That was His job. They were to possess the land. The report came back, and committees are great if they function properly,
[time=2255] but the report came back, and this committee said, "Oh, there are giants in that land."
[time=2263] And that's all they could see because they were looking through the eyes of man.
[time=2268] And Joshua and Caleb said, "Boy, I didn't see so many giants, but you should see the grapes, and you should see all the other
[time=2275] excitement and thrills of God's promises being fulfilled. That land is great.
[time=2280] Let's possess it." And they said, "No." And you know what?
[time=2284] They wandered in circles, in circles, in circles, in circles, and they circled for 40 years in the wilderness,
[time=2291] wondering what happened to God, belly aching about the things that didn't happen.
[time=2296] And all the time God says, "Hey, you could be in the land in 11 days." And you see, when we're not obedient in walking in the promises and in the Word of God,
[time=2310] we miss the rest He has for us. We miss the real opportunity to trust Him and believe in Him.
[time=2318] You see, the two got to see the promises. The ten never did.
[time=2325] I wonder if you're walking in circles today.
[time=2330] And you can't see the promises of God for all the things that are cluttering up your life.
[time=2336] Maybe it's a problem. Maybe it's something that's just confusing.
[time=2341] And you need to look at God's Word that is sharp and powerful and able to do what it says will accomplish.
[time=2350] Israel thought God wasn't able to accomplish what He said, really.
[time=2357] Hebrews 4.12 says, "For the Word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=2364] It penetrates even the dividing of the soul, the spirit, the joints, and the marrow.
[time=2368] It judges thoughts and the attitudes and the intents of the heart." Matthew 24.35 says, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my Word will never pass away."
[time=2379] You know all the things that we wander around in this earth to collect are going to be left behind because when we leave, we're going out the same way that we came in.
[time=2392] The man limits God by unbelief. If you look at verse 2 in chapter 4 of the book of Hebrew,
[time=2398] it says, "For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them.
[time=2402] But the Word of God did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."
[time=2412] In Jamaica as well as the rest of the world, when God's Word really gets and makes them a little bit uncomfortable
[time=2419] and they get under conviction, you know what they say? They'll pay pasta, you just don't understand our culture.
[time=2426] And that means don't get to, but you know something?
[time=2430] God's Word crosses all the cultural lines internationally around the world that was made to be preached worldwide.
[time=2440] And when you preach the Word of God and people come under convictions, they come up with the funniest excuses sometime for not doing the will of God, and then they limit God in their life.
[time=2451] And God doesn't have the opportunity to perform.
[time=2454] I want to speak to you on three things quickly this morning, limiting God through unbelief,
[time=2461] letting God's Word go in your life and living in the light of God's Word.
[time=2469] God's Word is always good news.
[time=2474] Israel didn't seem to be able to handle it many times, but God's Word is always good news.
[time=2480] And it needs to be mixed with faith and trust and belief.
[time=2484] It not only needs to be believed, but it needs to be received and taken in and put to work in our life.
[time=2491] You remember Abraham and Sarah?
[time=2495] Abraham and Sarah were given a promise in Genesis about having a son.
[time=2501] And my, how they look forward to it, and pretty soon they got a lot of miles on them, and age was taking over.
[time=2508] And Sarah's getting to get a few wrinkles the cosmetics couldn't take care of.
[time=2512] And Abraham was getting nervous and old, and he wasn't quite as wrinkled as I am.
[time=2517] But he was getting old, and he began to worry, and all of a sudden one day Sarah says, "I got a solution to our problem to get that promised Son of God." And he began to look through man's eyes and began to use man's logic and began to use man's ideas.
[time=2533] And all of a sudden she says, "Why don't you go to Hagar while you're still active, Abraham, and conceive a son?"
[time=2541] Well, they did that, and we have Ishmael today.
[time=2543] We still have the problem in the Near East, because God wants you to operate on the promises of His Word and His Word.
[time=2551] And you see Sarah and Abraham due to unbelief had Ishmael.
[time=2556] And then they went about their work a day life, and their problems began to come.
[time=2562] And as their problems began to come, all of a sudden one day in the routines of life, now this is how God operates.
[time=2570] He doesn't come down with bolts of lightning and great atomic energy splashing all over the skies.
[time=2576] "I want you in Jamaica, or I want you in somewhere else." He works through the routines of life, usually.
[time=2585] And Sarah was going along through getting dinner ready and managing the household, and Abraham was out doing.
[time=2592] And all of a sudden Sarah's room, who had been dead, became alive, and all of a sudden Abraham come running in.
[time=2597] Boy, something's taking place in our lives, Sarah, and all of a sudden Isaac is born, the promised one.
[time=2603] You see, God's timing and God's planning and God's Word is so important.
[time=2609] If Sarah and Abraham would have just gone along with God's timing and God's planning in their life, what a blessing that would have been to them.
[time=2624] I wonder sometimes if we don't, as Christians, begin to move out in our own logic and our own thinking, and we begin to do things through the eyes of man.
[time=2636] And all we begin to see in our life is the giants and the impossibilities instead of the promises of God that are true and everlasting.
[time=2646] You see Isaiah had a problem like that, and one day in Isaiah chapter 6, he saw God as he really was.
[time=2656] And he got his blurry vision back in focus because he saw God as he was.
[time=2665] One day as my wife and I were planning churches in the United States of America having the time of our life, we've always enjoyed.
[time=2672] There's nothing greater than serving God where he wants you to be.
[time=2676] And we were having the greatest time of our life, planning a church over here just outside of Columbus, Ohio, and God spoke to us through a man.
[time=2685] He said, "Well, why don't you take a trip down to Jamaica?" So we jumped on the plane, went down to Jamaica, and 30,000 feet over the water, God spoke to us about, you know, he can get your attention up there.
[time=2695] You know, the first step is a long one out of a plane that high, and we get said, "Okay, God, Jamaica's it."
[time=2702] So somebody asked me one time, they said, "Why are you in Jamaica? You should be getting ready to retire. You're getting old."
[time=2711] Well, I resemble that remark, you know. But I just thought in my head, you know, God called us to Jamaica.
[time=2720] And if I read verse 12, right, it says, "His word is powerful. His word is sharp."
[time=2727] But if you get into the text a little bit deeper, you'll find that it also provides the energy to perform.
[time=2733] And what a blessing thing it is to preach the Word of God in Jamaica and see God effectively take a hold of lives.
[time=2741] You know, in Matthew 16, 18, it says, "I will build my church."
[time=2747] And, you know, I want to be on the work crew that's building that church regardless of where it is.
[time=2752] When I was in the States before God called us in the ministry, I taught young people, and I was involved in teaching Sunday school, working with them.
[time=2759] And I just love to be where God wanted me to be and he called us into the ministry.
[time=2763] And that's the greatest place to be, is where God wants you to be.
[time=2767] I wonder if God wants you to be something greater in your capacity in this church, or maybe he would like to enlighten your eyes, and maybe brother Jim tonight will give you a little bit more focus on the mission field.
[time=2780] And God will speak to you, would you say, "I'm ready? I'm ready to go?"
[time=2787] Or would you say, "The 40 excuses that Christians give for not going?"
[time=2793] He may never want you to be removed, but he may want you to do something right where you are for him.
[time=2799] Well, let's let God's word go in our life now.
[time=2802] We've seen that God can clear up your vision, but in Hebrews 4.12 it says there are a couple things that are really exciting about God's word.
[time=2811] One of them, he says, that God's word is living.
[time=2815] If you will read the word of God, pretty soon it will get ahold of you, and it will activate you into thinking.
[time=2822] And in verse 12 it says, "It is living, and it is active."
[time=2828] Now, Mr. Richards, he's a 70-year-old man in Jamaica, and we started our first church in Mandeville in our living room.
[time=2837] And we got about 60 in there, and one night Mr. Richards came up, and he came up for it, and I hear Mr. Richards could quote more scripture than anybody in this room.
[time=2847] He knows all of the hymns by heart, and an excellent prayer.
[time=2854] He used to pray in prayer meeting the most thrilling prayers that would just send excitement up and down your body.
[time=2862] And he came forward in our first evening service, and he said, "Pastor Smith," and I said, "What are you doing here, Brother Richards?"
[time=2869] He says, "Me tinks its time, and he got saved." At 70 years old, and I could tell you a little more history, but time won't permit this morning.
[time=2880] But let me just share something with you. He is a deacon in our church now, and one of the most exciting older gentlemen that God has energized to serve him until he calls him to glory.
[time=2891] Another young lady came to our prayer meeting one night in our home, and we used to meet very informally in our living room,
[time=2897] and we just shared the word and shared it in an easy, comfortable way and let God's word and the Holy Spirit do the convicting.
[time=2906] You know, you can cram it down their throats, but they spit it out.
[time=2910] It's like trying to feed a baby, you know, pabble them.
[time=2914] You usually catch a couple spoons in the face when you try to feed them too fast.
[time=2918] We raised a few children, but I want to tell you, Marjorie came in one night, and she sat down.
[time=2924] She said, "Pastor, can I get saved tonight?" And I said, "Great!" So my wife led Marjorie to the Lord.
[time=2929] Now Marjorie's living with a man has four children, and they're not married, and she gets saved on Wednesday night.
[time=2934] Nobody did a preaching, but her mother is in another denomination, and she's an evangelist.
[time=2940] And Marjorie knew all about religion, but she didn't know Jesus Christ as her personal Savior.
[time=2946] And you know a lot of people are like that.
[time=2948] They fake out, they know the right words, they know the right procedure, they know how to sing the hymns and smile and look nice in church and all that stuff, but they're not saved.
[time=2956] They've never received Jesus Christ and invited him first.
[time=2959] Now Marjorie did, she went home to her man, she said, "Hey, we can't live like this anymore.
[time=2964] I'm a Christian now. We need to get married." And they were married, Marjorie's teaching Sunday school and our Sunday school now.
[time=2972] Her four children are coming faithfully, and our real bulwarks in the ministry down there.
[time=2976] Your pastor has met her, has met Mr. Richards, and they know what fine people they are.
[time=2981] And when God's Word takes a hold of a life and changes it.
[time=2984] Listen, if you have problems today, you let God's Word take a hold of your life.
[time=2989] God's Word has the answer, and He can meet your needs if you'll just invite Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=2997] Well, letting God's Word go in your life is very important.
[time=3000] The second thing about God's Word is it's sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=3005] Now Isaiah, in Isaiah chapter 6, he saw the sharpness of God.
[time=3011] When Isaiah looked up into the heavens, he beheld the majesty and the glory of God,
[time=3018] and he saw for the first time God as he really was, and he got his vision transformed,
[time=3024] and he could really see what God wanted him to do for the first time in a long, long time.
[time=3031] He saw God's glory, and he saw what God really was like.
[time=3042] And God began to do some things in his life.
[time=3046] But the first thing he did was that he found that there was a God in heaven
[time=3052] who was looking for men and women to fill the gap around the world.
[time=3056] And listen, we can use about 20 mature couples in Jamaica if you want to go back with this on the 28th of March.
[time=3063] Now, we don't want to take all your people, brother, but I'll tell you what.
[time=3066] If God excites you, oh, you say, "Well, I'm getting ready to retire." You know, that's what they asked me.
[time=3072] Why don't I never read about retiring in the Scriptures, and I never read when you're over 30, you're over the hill either.
[time=3079] But you know what I read in the Scriptures that Moses expired and somebody else took over,
[time=3085] and that's what I want to do.
[time=3089] And you see, just when we get smart enough, we get to the age where we retire
[time=3095] and just sit back when God could really use us to the glory of Himself.
[time=3102] Well, Isaiah got his vision straightened out because he saw God,
[time=3108] and he also had just lost a friend, King Uzziah, that he was leaning on pretty heavily.
[time=3114] The third thing, living in the light of God's Word.
[time=3117] I want you to see that.
[time=3118] Living in the light of God's Word because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.
[time=3125] It doesn't come from any other source.
[time=3128] And Jamaica today is just ready to receive God's Word.
[time=3132] And if we get the vision of letting God's Word go in our life, for it is the power of God unto salvation, not only that, but it is the energizing factor to perform what God calls you to do, where He calls you to do it.
[time=3146] And then we begin to live in the light of God's Word.
[time=3150] Look at verse 13 in Hebrews chapter 4, if you will, please.
[time=3153] Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight, but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.
[time=3164] There's coming a day when we, beloved, will have to account.
[time=3168] Galatians 6.7 says, "We shall reap what we sow." And there's going to come a day when we will have to account before God for some of the things that we have done.
[time=3179] Now I want you to think about Isaiah with me for just a moment.
[time=3183] In Isaiah chapter 6, it tells us that when Isaiah saw the holiness of God,
[time=3190] when He looked up and He saw God as He really was, not as man imagined Him to be, He saw God in all of His capabilities, He saw God in all of His greatness, and He saw Him with the power to perform what He called Him to do.
[time=3206] It tells us five things very clearly that happen to Isaiah.
[time=3212] One, when Isaiah saw God in all of His glory, He had a clear vision.
[time=3225] He had a clear vision, and He saw, I believe, Jesus Christ in His majestic glory.
[time=3233] And beloved, if God ever gives you the opportunity to see Jesus as He really is, He'll melt your heart, He'll break your heart, He'll convict you of sin, He'll cause you to be uncomfortable, miserable until you see Him and you respond to Him.
[time=3250] The second thing that He saw, that He was convicted of His sin,
[time=3257] "Woe is me," He said, "I'm a man of unclean lips."
[time=3266] And the more that we're in the Word of God, we realize how sinful we are, and how many times we get caught up in the routines of rocking in the 40 years of circling
[time=3276] and picking up things that just clutter up our life.
[time=3281] He saw the conviction of sin in His own life.
[time=3287] And the more that we're in God's Word, the clearer we see ourselves as we really are.
[time=3293] The third thing that happened to Isaiah there was that he was cleansed.
[time=3299] He was cleansed before God.
[time=3301] The live coals came down and touched his lips, and he got a new excitement in life, and he was a brand new cleaned up person ready to go out.
[time=3309] Now, excited about things.
[time=3311] I was reading in U.S. today down in Jamaica once in a while, we get a copy of that, and I clipped out a little thing, and it says, "To be successful, 85 percent of it is enthusiasm." And so I get excited about things.
[time=3325] I hope you do.
[time=3326] I hope you can get excited about the Lord Jesus.
[time=3328] I hope you can get excited about sending these people down there that are going to be such a great asset to the ministry in Jamaica.
[time=3334] We're really excited about them coming.
[time=3336] God has a great place to use them.
[time=3338] But how about you that aren't coming?
[time=3340] How about God's place for you?
[time=3342] What are you doing?
[time=3344] What are you doing up there in the bleachers?
[time=3347] What are you doing out there in television land?
[time=3349] That's going to count for all eternity.
[time=3351] You know you're not going to take this stuff.
[time=3353] You collect in the 40 years of wandering with you.
[time=3355] You're going up the same way you came out in your birthday suit.
[time=3361] That's right.
[time=3362] It may be a little more wrinkled, but it's the same outfit that you came in with.
[time=3371] Another fourth thing, after he got cleaned up by the blood, after he got his life straightened around, he had a fresh vision of what God wanted.
[time=3381] He saw God from his point of view, and he said, "Boy, this is exciting." Remember, I said, "I want to be part of God's work crew." He said, "I am going to build my church in the gates of hell while I prevail against." Listen, don't you want to be a part of that work crew?
[time=3396] Don't you want to get your...
[time=3398] Well, you don't have to get a hammer in his soul.
[time=3400] You just have to use the gift of God that he gives to you to his glory and to his honor, and he will do the rest.
[time=3407] He'll energize you, he'll empower you, he'll strengthen you.
[time=3410] And one of the great things my wife and I have appreciated is just seeing God use his word, and the power of God's word is his preach to transform and to change even those that are steeped in culture that is far beyond the biblical approach.
[time=3425] Then the last thing, after he got the fresh vision of what God wanted in verse 8
[time=3431] and verse 8, he also committed his life.
[time=3435] He said, "Lord, I'm ready.
[time=3438] Send me.
[time=3439] I am ready.
[time=3440] I'm clean.
[time=3442] I'm open.
[time=3443] You've shown me what it is, and I'm ready to do what you want me to do." Now, you know something?
[time=3450] Isaiah did not know what God wanted him to do.
[time=3453] I'm afraid if you read on in that chapter, after that, you'll find out that God said, "I'm going to send you, Isaiah, to a people that won't listen to you, they'll laugh at you, they won't receive you." What a job he had to do.
[time=3465] But you know something, how about here this morning?
[time=3468] In the auditorium, out in your homes, wherever you are, are you ready just to commit your life?
[time=3474] He may never move you from where you are.
[time=3477] But what he's looking is for a life that is open to allow his word to effect
[time=3483] and then to communicate his word out so that other people are affected and saved and brought in so that his glory will be received.
[time=3491] Will you bow your head with me this morning, please?
[time=3494] As Pastor Rick comes to the platform now, I want to ask you just three questions as we close.
[time=3501] If you hear God speaking today for salvation, maybe you have never trusted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, and you need to be saved.
[time=3518] This is Mission's Month at the Blackhawk Baptist Church, and we've been encouraged by our missionaries who have come home to tell us of their outreach ministry and their fields.
[time=3526] This is the purpose of the Bible Hour to tell you about the saving power of Jesus Christ.
[time=3531] If you've had an opportunity today to make a decision concerning your relationship with Christ, I'd like to take this moment and pray with you.
[time=3538] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[time=3541] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3548] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3551] I ask you to come in and forgive me of my sins and dwell in my heart today.
[time=3557] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3560] If you've made a decision today, would you write us and tell us the nature of that decision?
[time=3565] Then when you write, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3572] To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlets mentioned earlier entitled "Satisfaction," please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
