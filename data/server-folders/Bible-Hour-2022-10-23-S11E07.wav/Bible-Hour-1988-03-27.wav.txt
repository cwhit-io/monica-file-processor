[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=100] Greeks like Sophocles used a form of drama called a tragedy.
[time=105] In it, the hero like Oedipus would be rising towards the pinnacle of triumph only to be cut down in tragedy at the end.
[time=114] As we look at the story of Jesus Christ, is he actually a hero on his way to a triumphal entry and then caught in the trenches of tragedy?
[time=125] Was he the victor or the victim?
[time=129] [MUSIC]
[time=139] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=142] Thank you for joining us.
[time=144] Rick's message today is entitled "A Son, a Savior, His Passion." Was Jesus the victim or the victor?
[time=152] If he was God, why did he die and why in such an agonizing way?
[time=157] In our study of the life of Christ today, we will discover five important aspects of the passion and death of Christ that are absolutely life-changing.
[time=166] For in the end, we will each be either the victim or the victor.
[time=170] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of John, chapter 10.
[time=176] We will be looking at verses 14 through 18.
[time=180] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=185] Other special music includes solos from Sue Toyrak, Dennis Kirschner, and Joni King.
[time=196] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=205] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=210] Now, here's Rick.
[time=212] I did that you're here.
[time=214] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=219] This is a Sunday that we call Palm Sunday.
[time=222] It commemorates the day that Jesus rode into Jerusalem, being received victoriously
[time=228] as both King and his Messiah.
[time=231] And they took Palm branches and waved them before him as the tradition of greeting nobility was.
[time=237] Then they cast them before him and formed a pathway of palms.
[time=242] Singing of that, our choir presents to us palms on his pathway.
[time=252] [MUSIC]
[time=280] Palm Sunday's pathway and praises before him.
[time=288] Joyful song that we sing.
[time=296] Home to his pathway and hearts to our glory.
[time=304] Worship the coming King.
[time=311] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=313] Holy might we adore.
[time=315] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=317] Jesus, Messiah, and Lord.
[time=321] [MUSIC - 81 seconds]
[time=432] We come and we think about that blessed event when Jesus rode into the city.
[time=441] Realize that everyone was in awe as the King of Kings entered.
[time=445] All hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall.
[time=449] Him number 18, please, we'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas of Him number 18.
[time=455] [MUSIC]
[time=474] Oh, hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall.
[time=483] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=536] Oh, hail the power of God.
[time=541] Oh, hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall.
[time=551] [MUSIC]
[time=579] Thank you for that triumphal singing.
[time=581] We appreciate your participation and worshiping the Lord in this way.
[time=585] We continue with music now as we have a special number by Susan Toyrak.
[time=589] Let's listen as she comes to sing for us.
[time=592] [MUSIC]
[time=621] Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight a path for him.
[time=631] For when he goes, mighty things begin.
[time=639] Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain may go.
[time=646] The crooked strait, the red places plain, and everyone will know that the glory of the Lord has been revealed
[time=662] by the lights that are redeemed and the hearts that are healed.
[time=670] So lift up your hearts and look for the Lord, our praises draw him here.
[time=679] He is ready to come, prepare ye the way for him here.
[time=690] The glory of the Lord has been revealed by the lights that are redeemed and the hearts that are healed.
[time=705] So lift up your hearts and look for the Lord, our praises draw him here.
[time=714] He is ready to come, he is ready to come, prepare ye the way for him here.
[time=729] For when he comes, mighty things begin.
[time=736] Free people will be on fire.
[time=743] We are so thankful that you have joined us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=754] Today, as we speak to you, it is Palm Sunday, but I know that as you watch, it is actually Easter.
[time=760] And we hope already on this day you have had a very meaningful time with the Lord.
[time=765] We want to encourage you to join us tonight to make your Easter even a greater day because of the music we have planned.
[time=773] Rick, this is a victorious Sunday for all Christians, and we have entitled our evening service, Jesus Lives.
[time=779] It is a compilation of a lot of songs that speak of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=783] Our choir will be singing.
[time=785] Many of the soloists that we all see on the Bible Hour, Marilyn Wong, the celebration, Keith and Star Broadingham will all be singing victorious songs,
[time=795] commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=797] It is going to be a great evening.
[time=799] It is April 3 at 6 p.m. here at the Convocation Center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=804] Well, we all have our favorite type of music, but I want to announce that my favorite without a doubt is the music that you are singing tonight.
[time=812] It speaks about the power of the resurrection that Jesus is alive, and there is a manly majesty about all of that.
[time=819] It is strong music, that is for sure.
[time=821] I am excited for all of you who will have a chance to be a part of it, and if you possibly can make it tonight at 6 o'clock,
[time=828] you will want to be here at Black Hawk to worship the Lord in this way.
[time=832] Pete, we've been encouraging them to come to another concert, but the time has already passed with the Hicks and Cohegan concert.
[time=838] We've been announcing to those that have been watching the Hicks and Cohegan concert on April 30, Rick, and I'm sorry and yet pleased to announce that
[time=847] all the tickets are sold.
[time=849] Some of you have inquired, and if you haven't heard from us yet, you will this week, but we are thankful for those that have responded, and Rick, the program is full, so we are unable to invite others to join us for that great evening.
[time=861] If you've been thinking about coming and have delayed, we are fortunately able to provide for some of those, but those of you who have delayed, we cannot, but thanks for your interest.
[time=872] We would encourage you today, though, to write for a booklet we have for each of you, and we'll make sure we have enough of these.
[time=878] It's a booklet called Satisfaction, speaks to the very issue of the heart of life.
[time=884] We as Americans have so much. Even those of us who look at our lifestyle, we talk about limited incomes and things like that, we still possess so much, and yet we are so empty.
[time=898] Isn't that a strange paradox? I've had the privilege over the last few years of going to a number of other countries to do missions work.
[time=906] There I have met people who have by our standards absolutely nothing, and yet on the inside they have something that gives them more satisfaction than many of us today.
[time=918] Satisfaction comes from the inside out, not the outside in, and perhaps you are looking for something to give satisfaction to your life.
[time=929] Well, Jesus said, "I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly, inner satisfaction."
[time=938] Would you like to know more about it? We have a booklet by that title just for you if you'll write to us today.
[time=944] What a joy to know the satisfaction that Jesus gives.
[time=948] You can write for this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=959] Once again, write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=968] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour, and if it's all possible, we'd like to encourage you to join us tonight in person for the music of celebration Jesus lives.
[time=980] Here at 6 o'clock, we'll look forward to seeing you then. Thanks again for joining us today.
[time=985] We hope that you have both an open Bible and an open heart to study God's Word with us now.
[time=998] Dear Earth and all that the world can impart was the message that came to my heart.
[time=1020] How that Jesus alone for my sin did own and Calvary covers it all.
[time=1039] Calvary covers it all.
[time=1047] My past with its sin and its pain, my guilt and despair, Jesus took on him there, and Calvary covers it all.
[time=1075] How blessed the thought that my soul by him brought, shelled well in that glory on high,
[time=1093] where with gladness and soul I'll be one of the throne, and Calvary covers it all.
[time=1112] Calvary covers it all.
[time=1120] My past with its sin and its pain, my guilt and despair, Jesus took on him there,
[time=1138] and Calvary covers it all.
[time=1148] I'd like to ask you to stand now as we recite our memory verse for the week.
[time=1160] It's a verse that relates right around the theme of Dennis's song about the love of God demonstrated through that death at Calvary.
[time=1168] Romans 5a, but God demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=1181] Romans 5a, thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1195] We all walked away with nothing to say.
[time=1209] They just lost their dearest friend, all that he said.
[time=1220] Now he was dead.
[time=1224] Was this the way it would end?
[time=1231] The dreams they had dreamed were not what they seemed.
[time=1239] Now that he was dead and gone, the garden, the jail, the hammer, the nail.
[time=1254] How could a night be so new?
[time=1265] In came the morning, night and day to day.
[time=1279] The stone was pulled away, home rose with a door.
[time=1293] In came the morning, shadows vanished before the sun.
[time=1306] Death had lost, and all I could know.
[time=1331] The angels, the star, the kings from afar, the wedding, the water, the wine.
[time=1345] Now it was done, they had taken her son.
[time=1352] We stood before his time.
[time=1359] She knew it was true, she watched him die too.
[time=1366] She heard them call him just a man.
[time=1373] But deep in her heart, she knew from the start.
[time=1380] Down how her son would live again.
[time=1391] In came the morning, night and day to day.
[time=1405] The stone was pulled away, home rose with a door.
[time=1418] In came the morning, shadows vanished before the sun.
[time=1431] Death had lost, and all I could know.
[time=1441] In came the morning, shadows vanished before the sun.
[time=1460] Death had lost, and all I could know.
[time=1468] The morning had come, the morning had come.
[time=1492] After a journey, the announcement that the morning had come, Friday, pain, dying, darkness.
[time=1503] Sunday, light, resurrection, he is alive.
[time=1510] O Lord Jesus, we worship you today because you are alive.
[time=1515] And we praise you for going through the darkness and dying for our sins.
[time=1520] And we worship you for being the resurrection and the life and the light of Easter morning.
[time=1526] And we give all praise and all glory to you.
[time=1531] And with anticipation, we look forward to the next morning when you come again.
[time=1536] And we pray even with the saints of old, even so come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[time=1543] Oh God, we pray that the very message of that song today would be used by your spirit to encourage the hearts of believers today.
[time=1552] As Bill Layman suffers this day with the loss of his partner Eleanor, may the fixed hope of Jesus Christ be the light of that coming morning.
[time=1563] We pray today for Eleanor's daughters, Pat and Murna and their families that you would comfort them.
[time=1571] We pray this morning for Betsy Menzel and the death of her parents in a car accident that you would not only comfort them in their loss but keep them in their great travels to care for their family.
[time=1586] God, give us that steadfast hope of a resurrection morning.
[time=1591] We pray that you would encourage those who have gone through tough times who have waited in deep waters.
[time=1599] That they might find that you have been there with each and every obstacle they have faced.
[time=1607] We pray for those who are finding that they are alone in life, those surrounded by people, loneliness grips them.
[time=1616] May they find you their constant companion.
[time=1620] We pray for those who are facing the unfaithfulness of their mate.
[time=1626] May they find you as their faithful support and strength.
[time=1631] We pray for those who are discovering the emptiness in their life.
[time=1636] Dreams fulfilled and yet empty.
[time=1640] May they find the fulfillment of the resurrected Christ.
[time=1645] Even as we study this morning, we ask you to speak as only you can to go beyond the words of man, beyond even the words of your scriptures,
[time=1656] but to have the word of your spirit speak to each heart today.
[time=1660] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[time=1664] [AMEN] This is Palm Sunday.
[time=1671] It is a Sunday that we commemorate in the history of the life of Christ.
[time=1677] He is entering Jerusalem on this morning.
[time=1680] The crowds have gathered to praise Him.
[time=1684] They have lined the streets of Jerusalem anticipating His arrival.
[time=1689] They have gone out into the trees and they've broken off Palm branches that they could wave the branches before Him.
[time=1696] This is the way they treated nobility.
[time=1699] This is the way a conquering emperor would be received.
[time=1703] If Caesar himself should come to Jerusalem, they would know of no grander entrance than the waving of the palms.
[time=1713] And so young and old have lined the city.
[time=1716] They have waved their palm branches and they have shouted, "Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=1724] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna to the seed of David."
[time=1731] And as he would approach, they would cast the palm branches and form a pathway for the entrance of nobility,
[time=1740] for the arrival of a king on that Sunday morning.
[time=1747] But before the week would end, that same crowd would reconvene at another place.
[time=1754] And those same voices that uttered Hosanna would on this Friday morning be shouting out with anger,
[time=1762] "Crucify Him, give us Barabbas."
[time=1768] Suddenly, it appears that the victor has become the victim.
[time=1777] The Greeks had a form of drama they called the tragedy.
[time=1782] It was a plot where the victor rises only to face, ultimate the feed and end up the victim at the end.
[time=1793] Thucydides and Sophocles wrote most of the famous tragedies, but none more famous than Oedipus Rex, Oedipus the king.
[time=1801] Oedipus was born the son of a king, but Apollo had warned that a day would come when Oedipus would grow up
[time=1810] and he would kill his own father and marry his own mother.
[time=1815] And so the baby Oedipus was taken from mother and father and sent far away to Corinth, there to be raised by Polybus.
[time=1823] And so young Oedipus grows up, believing Polybus is his father and Corinth is his home.
[time=1830] And as he grows into young adulthood, he hears the oracle of a Paulus against him that someday he would kill his father.
[time=1839] And believing Polybus was his father, he fled from Corinth on his odyssey, he faces the Sphinx.
[time=1847] The Sphinx stops everyone who crosses the path and destroys the individual if they cannot answer the riddle.
[time=1855] What is it that walks on four legs, then on two and then in three?
[time=1861] No one had ever answered the Sphinx.
[time=1864] But Oedipus says it is man, for man crawls on all fours as an infant, stands erect on two feet in adulthood
[time=1872] and then is assisted with a cane for a third foot in his old age.
[time=1877] The Sphinx becomes angry, curses him and dies.
[time=1882] Oedipus proceeds on and a stranger crosses his path, neither will yield, and so a battle ensues and Oedipus kills the stranger.
[time=1893] Years later he ends up in the city of that stranger.
[time=1897] He meets a beautiful woman, a widow, and he marries her.
[time=1902] And at the end of the story, Oedipus discovers the stranger that he killed was his natural father.
[time=1910] And the widow that he married was Jocasta, his natural mother.
[time=1916] And in his rage he gouges out his eyes and Jocasta hangs herself.
[time=1924] And the victor dies a victim.
[time=1931] Is that the story of Jesus of Nazareth?
[time=1935] Is it just one more Greek tragedy?
[time=1938] Was he actually this obscure individual who the fates, the gods of Oedipus had arranged his path?
[time=1946] And he rises up, appearing to be a victor.
[time=1950] And Palm Sunday is his day, but good Friday comes.
[time=1956] And he's returned to his rightful lot as a victim.
[time=1963] Are these stories recorded in the gospels, these writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John?
[time=1970] Are they nothing more than Greek tragedies?
[time=1973] Have they simply borrowed the plot from Sophocles, triumph, or tragedy?
[time=1982] What do these things mean?
[time=1984] If you have a Bible, I invite you to open them to John, chapter 10, and we'll look together at John, chapter 10,
[time=1991] verses 14 through verses 18.
[time=1997] We have been studying since the weeks before Christmas, the birth and life of Christ.
[time=2004] Now today we come to this event called Palm Sunday.
[time=2009] But rather than read for you today the typical narratives of the triumphal entry, we need to go behind the scene and get into the heart and mind of Christ
[time=2020] before we'll understand.
[time=2022] Was he the victor or was he the victim?
[time=2027] Is this tragedy or is this triumph?
[time=2031] John, chapter 10, verse 14.
[time=2035] Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd.
[time=2041] I know my sheep, and my sheep know me.
[time=2046] Just as the father knows me, and I know the father and lay down my life for the sheep.
[time=2055] I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen.
[time=2061] I must bring them also.
[time=2065] They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd."
[time=2075] The reason my father loves me is that I lay down my life for the sheep.
[time=2083] And if I lay my life down, I take it up again.
[time=2088] No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself.
[time=2092] I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.
[time=2098] This command I received from my father.
[time=2103] Now these words that we have just read of Jesus are words that he spoke long before Easter,
[time=2109] long before good Friday, long before Palm Sunday.
[time=2113] These are months in advance.
[time=2117] John records for us more conversation with Christ than the other three gospels put together.
[time=2123] We get the inside track when we read John.
[time=2126] And here Jesus begins to explain quite thoroughly the coming tragedy in the ultimate triumph.
[time=2134] He forecasts not only his death and dying, but he foretells its purpose and its motive.
[time=2143] As we investigate the life and the death of Christ, may I share with you five insights
[time=2149] this morning out of this passage that explained to us the significance of the death of Christ.
[time=2155] First of all, a little explanation.
[time=2158] Jesus is here speaking and John is recording a series of thoughts.
[time=2163] One builds upon the other and the second on the third and on it goes.
[time=2168] It crescendos.
[time=2169] So I'm going to reason with you from the end to the beginning.
[time=2174] So we'll work from verse 18 to 14.
[time=2176] That may help unconfuse you.
[time=2178] Here are these five insights.
[time=2181] One is this, the death of Christ was the vision of the Father.
[time=2187] It ends by talking about Jesus said I'm laying down my life.
[time=2191] I'm giving it up and this command I received from my Father.
[time=2197] If you've ever been a student of history, as a student of history you study far more than names, places and dates.
[time=2204] That can be repetitious.
[time=2205] That can be boring.
[time=2207] Even if you have the little poems in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.
[time=2212] Those help you to remember Columbus 1492 sailed, discovered something.
[time=2216] I think it was Italian food.
[time=2218] But you learn more than that in history.
[time=2221] When you study history, you study a philosophy of history.
[time=2226] Let me explain to you philosophies of history.
[time=2229] There is the philosophy of Hegel called dialecticalism.
[time=2233] Hegel teaches that there is a movement, social, political, economic movement.
[time=2238] And he calls that thesis.
[time=2241] There is a social, political, economic movement that comes in rivalry.
[time=2245] And the two collide.
[time=2247] Neither one wins.
[time=2249] They merge and form what he calls synthesis.
[time=2252] And the synthesis becomes a new thesis and an antithesis evolved.
[time=2257] And history is nothing more of one movement versus another.
[time=2262] There is a form of history in its interpretation called determinism.
[time=2266] Determinism may or may not evolve God or gods.
[time=2271] It simply says that life is charted out before you.
[time=2276] And there is nothing that you can do to alter your destiny.
[time=2280] The Greeks were deterministic.
[time=2282] Edipus and his parents tried to avoid destiny, but destiny could not be shaken.
[time=2291] But there is a third view of history.
[time=2295] I call it divine prerogative.
[time=2297] It is the belief that God actually sits sovereignly on his throne.
[time=2303] And though he gives great freedom of choices, he sets the boundaries.
[time=2308] He fences in the horizons.
[time=2310] Have you ever heard the word predestination?
[time=2313] It's actually the word pro-oridzo.
[time=2315] Pro means before oridzo horizon.
[time=2319] It means that God sets the boundaries.
[time=2322] And within his boundaries he gives freedom of choice, but God's sovereign will is done.
[time=2328] I believe that God had a vision for his creation.
[time=2334] And that vision was that he would send Jesus Christ to die.
[time=2338] And throughout history he was always in control.
[time=2341] And the death of Christ was not the thesis of the Romans
[time=2347] colliding with the antithesis of the Jews.
[time=2350] And the only thing they could agree on was this Jesus has got to die.
[time=2355] Nor was it the determination that fate impersonally moved against a pawn.
[time=2362] And Jesus was just one little move on the chessboard that was expendable.
[time=2367] But the scripture actually teaches that the death of Christ was the divine prerogative.
[time=2374] That God had actually shaped history for this very day.
[time=2379] Jesus spoke about his death and he said this is the command.
[time=2386] This is the plan.
[time=2388] This is an instruction.
[time=2389] This is what God has ordered from me.
[time=2391] As he shaped his plan for the ages, Jesus said it was my death.
[time=2396] That he envisioned.
[time=2398] Do you know that is so consistent with scripture.
[time=2401] Do you know the Old Testament is full of illusions to the suffering of Messiah?
[time=2409] Now if you would learn a little prophecy, learn this.
[time=2414] Prophecy increases with its significance, the greater the time between prediction and fulfillment.
[time=2423] Let me illustrate.
[time=2424] If I were to stand here today and say I predict, let me think this here.
[time=2429] So I predict that George Bush will be the Republican nomination for president.
[time=2434] That's not real impressive.
[time=2436] I mean that simply means I can either read the newspaper or listen to the television set and there's about an 80% chance.
[time=2444] But what if I could today say to you, I predict and give you a name of who the Republican nominee will be in the year 2000.
[time=2454] And you remember, and in 12 years I was right.
[time=2458] That's far more impressive.
[time=2460] The greater the time, the more significance.
[time=2462] Now I have no predictions about this year or the year 2000.
[time=2468] But there are prophecies in the Bible that go before Christ as far back as 1000 years.
[time=2476] And they predict things like that Jesus would be betrayed by a friend.
[time=2481] That he would be sold for 30 pieces of silver.
[time=2484] That those 30 pieces of silver would be collected in the courtyard of the temple and used to buy a potter's field.
[time=2491] The Bible predicted 1000 years before the death of Christ that his hands and his feet would be pierced.
[time=2499] It predicted his death in dying down to the parting of his garments being resisted and so they would cast lots.
[time=2509] Let me just read some of these for you.
[time=2512] Isaiah 53 12.
[time=2515] Therefore I will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with the strong because he poured out his life on the death and he was numbered with the transgressors.
[time=2528] For he bore the sin of many and made intercession for transgressors.
[time=2533] Isaiah pointed to the fact that Messiah would not only come but that he would die, and not only that he would die, that he would die amongst common criminals, transgressors.
[time=2546] Psalm 22 speaks so clearly.
[time=2550] It says they stare at me, they mock me, they jeer me.
[time=2555] My hands and feet they appears. My side is wounded.
[time=2562] You see this death of Christ was not a vague tragedy of determinism.
[time=2570] It was the very vision of the Father.
[time=2573] A second insight I would share with you this morning.
[time=2577] It was the volition of the Son.
[time=2580] Look again at verse 18.
[time=2585] No one takes it from me.
[time=2589] I lay it down of my own accord.
[time=2593] I have authority to lay it down and have authority to take it up again.
[time=2601] Now when you see Jesus in the panoramic week, you see him first received as a king, then you see the tide of popular opinion turned against him.
[time=2611] That same crowd calls out crucify him and he is crucified and he looks as though he is a helpless victim.
[time=2624] He is arrested at night, that was illegal. He was taken before the Sanhedrin and Caiaphas the High Priest, that was illegal.
[time=2632] He was shuffled through the night over to Pilate who received him at morning's light.
[time=2637] Pilate sends him off to Herod. Herod sends him back to Pilate.
[time=2642] Pilate promptly sticks him up for public ridicule and everybody says, "Get rid of him."
[time=2649] He's expendable. He's disposable. Caiaphas even says, "It's good that one Jew die rather than the whole city being turmoil."
[time=2662] Jesus says, "I'm not the victim of Caiaphas. I'm not betrayed by Judas. I have not been sentenced by Pilate.
[time=2674] I'm not the victim of popularity turned sour." He says, "I lay it down. There's no knife in his back."
[time=2687] He determined that he would go to Jerusalem and he foretold that he would die and he constantly says that he does it of his own volition.
[time=2698] He is willing to do it. But the phrase here that strikes me with such power is this phrase of Jesus when he says,
[time=2707] "I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up again."
[time=2714] I like that phrase because when you come to John chapter 19, Jesus is standing before Pilate. He has been up all night going from one kangaroo court to another.
[time=2725] Justice has made mockery. He has already been abused and mistreated. They have spit on him. They have crowned him. They have mocked him.
[time=2735] They have thrown a blanket over his head and slapped him and said, "If your prophet tells which one of us hits you."
[time=2741] He's standing before Pilate, physically a beaten and worn man, probably in shackles.
[time=2750] And Pilate asks Jesus a question and there's no response. And Pilate says, "Don't you know? I have authority to release you or to take your life."
[time=2763] Pilate says, "I have authority." Jesus breaks his silence and he says, "You have no authority except what is given you from above."
[time=2780] You talk about profiles and courage. Here is a man who could escape. Here was a man that if he would just choose to say so, could be released.
[time=2790] Here was God in man. As the hymn writer put it, he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free.
[time=2801] But Jesus said to Pilate, "You have no authority." Authority comes from above. Jesus said, "I have the authority over my life."
[time=2815] Whenever you think of the death of Christ, don't ever think of a defeated Galilean. Here was a man who purposefully walked into death saying, "I'm coming to lay my life down."
[time=2831] A third insight is this one. It's victorious in its end. We're moving back upwards, but look at again at verse 17.
[time=2842] The reason my father loves me is that I lay down my life only to take it up again. Let that register in your mind.
[time=2851] Only to take it up again. Verse 18, "No man takes it from me. I lay it down in my own accord and I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again."
[time=2864] Jesus had a plan. The plan was a temporary defeat to secure an ultimate victory. Jesus said, "I am going to die that will appear to be a temporary defeat."
[time=2881] But that temporary defeat secures the ultimate victory, which is demonstrated by his resurrection when he takes his life up again.
[time=2893] It's a very, very well-planned military strategy that an army purposefully suffers a temporary defeat to gain an ultimate victory.
[time=2906] That's how Crazy Horse won the battle of Little Bighorn.
[time=2912] Custer had a great army, and Crazy Horse sent a band of Indians to attack an army that was too big.
[time=2921] Defeat was certain, and as that great army would begin to crush that attacking Indian force that Indian force would turn and run.
[time=2929] And the army thinking victory was theirs, defeat was for the enemy, would race after them, and they would follow the trail of this fleeing Indian tribe into a valley called the Little Bighorn.
[time=2942] And on every hill on the opposite side of that valley were thousands upon thousands of the Sioux Nation.
[time=2950] And when Custer pursued that temporary victory into the valley, the Indian nations swallowed him up.
[time=2958] Jesus said, "I am willing to suffer a temporary defeat, dying on the cross, because I am going to rise from the grave in ultimate victory."
[time=2971] You know, one of the worst things you can ever do is measure a book before you get to the last chapter.
[time=2978] That's when you find out who really wins.
[time=2982] I'm so thankful for that song we heard this morning.
[time=2986] Spoke of the darkness, spoke of the tomb, spoke of the stone, but then came the morning.
[time=2996] Oh, when you read of the life of Christ, don't stop that he died.
[time=3000] There's a morning called Easter when he secures the ultimate victory.
[time=3006] Fourth observation is this one.
[time=3009] The death of Christ is the venture of believers.
[time=3016] Look at verse 16.
[time=3019] "I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen.
[time=3024] I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd."
[time=3034] Jesus is using imagery that they would really understand.
[time=3039] They knew a lot about shepherds, and they knew a lot about sheep.
[time=3042] So when Jesus would say, "I'm the good shepherd," they can picture a shepherd.
[time=3046] They knew what a shepherd does, they knew his work, they knew his lifestyle.
[time=3051] And when they used the expression, "I have many sheep," they would know like a shepherd watches sheep.
[time=3056] Jesus is saying he's the shepherd of people.
[time=3059] But now he says something to them that's new.
[time=3062] He says to them, "I have other sheep, not of this sheep pen."
[time=3069] Allow a little theology for a moment.
[time=3072] The nation of Israel is considered unique and rightfully so.
[time=3076] God had uniquely called them.
[time=3078] They were God's sheep.
[time=3081] Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd of God's sheep, the house of Israel." But now he says to them, "I have other sheep who are not of this sheepful."
[time=3092] Jesus is alluding for one of the first times to the fact that his plan and his role as shepherd,
[time=3101] and the effect of his dying is for more than just the house of Israel.
[time=3106] He said, "I have other sheep." And then he puts this urgency, "They are my sheep too, and I must reach them.
[time=3116] I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen.
[time=3119] I must bring them also." And he introduces the urgency of spreading the gospel.
[time=3126] "They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock, Israel, Gentiles, one flock,
[time=3135] one shepherd." Jesus gave that message here, but it's not until after he dies and he comes back to life
[time=3146] that he says this to his disciples, "As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you also."
[time=3156] In a phrase we call that the Great Commission, it's recorded in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and Acts.
[time=3165] But that is not five accounts of one event.
[time=3168] Actually, if you study the details, those are five different times in the 40 days between his resurrection
[time=3176] and his ascension.
[time=3178] Jesus tells them, "Go, find those other sheep, bring them in."
[time=3185] I call it the venture of the believer, to be involved in the process of finding those other sheep.
[time=3195] The word "venture" has two notions, at least in my mind.
[time=3199] It have, "venture" has the notion of opportunity, but it also has the dimension of risk.
[time=3206] Someone who is on a venture is someone who is risking to gain an opportunity.
[time=3212] There is an individual in the book of Philippians called Epaphroditus.
[time=3216] Not one of the most known individuals of the Bible, but Epaphroditus is a man I like.
[time=3223] He was a risk taker.
[time=3226] Paul said that he was near unto death, but he refused to stay home.
[time=3230] But for your sakes, Epaphroditus had to come.
[time=3233] And Paul says in Greek, he was a parabola.
[time=3237] It means someone who casts the dice.
[time=3244] Now I'm not encouraging you at all to go to Las Vegas or Atlantic City.
[time=3248] That's not the point, but the word actually means someone who will take a roll of the dice.
[time=3252] It means a chance taker.
[time=3255] Epaphroditus was a chance taker.
[time=3260] And you know Jesus Christ calls us to take a chance.
[time=3266] In our society we become too fond of a word.
[time=3270] It is the word security.
[time=3273] And in our society now we only move for those things that gain more security.
[time=3279] Well my job have more security.
[time=3281] Well my house payments be more and more manageable.
[time=3284] Well on my senior years have enough to live on.
[time=3289] Security is a noble pursuit, but it is not a God.
[time=3296] And God calls us to a venture.
[time=3300] He calls us to be risk takers.
[time=3304] He calls us to be gamblers for Christ's sake.
[time=3308] He has other sheep and he says I must bring them in also.
[time=3314] Now as the Father has sent me, I'm sending you also.
[time=3321] Fifth observation, fifth insight about the death of Christ.
[time=3326] It's vicarious for us.
[time=3330] Verse 14, I am the good shepherd.
[time=3334] My sheep, I know.
[time=3336] And my sheep know me.
[time=3339] Just as the Father knows me, I know the Father.
[time=3342] And this phrase, I lay down my life for the sheep.
[time=3351] That expression for the sheep speaks about a substitutionary death.
[time=3356] It speaks about that which is vicarious.
[time=3359] Jesus did it, but he didn't do it for himself.
[time=3362] He did it for me.
[time=3367] He paid the penalty, I received the benefit.
[time=3372] You receive the benefit if you receive Christ.
[time=3378] That's why he died for you, for me.
[time=3386] That's why Wesley wrote, "And can it be that I should gain an interest in my Savior's name.
[time=3395] Died he for me who caused him pain.
[time=3399] For me, who him to death pursued." Amazing love.
[time=3405] How can it be that thou my God should die for me?
[time=3412] That's why we had you memorize Romans 5a.
[time=3415] That you might know the four most important words of the Scripture.
[time=3420] Christ died for us.
[time=3427] As a high school student, the very goal of my life, my venture was to swim.
[time=3432] I thought if I could just swim fast, there would be coaches at colleges who would notice me, and I would have college scholarship.
[time=3439] What a venture.
[time=3441] I discovered something in swimming.
[time=3443] You know, when you swim, you have a lot of time to think.
[time=3446] There's a scenery to look at, you just go down one side of the black line, back the other side.
[time=3451] Nobody to talk to, just down lots of time to think.
[time=3454] When you swim as fast as I do, you have more time to think.
[time=3458] You just think.
[time=3460] I'm thinking, as I'm swimming, about this adventure.
[time=3465] We stop at the end of 400 yards, and I stop, and a guy named Jeff stops.
[time=3469] Jeff looks at me, and he says, "Dale says you're going to church." That's kind of strange for a guy from our team.
[time=3476] Yeah, I'm going to church.
[time=3477] Why do you do that?
[time=3478] Why do I do this camp?
[time=3479] I heard about what Jesus Christ could do for me.
[time=3482] Coach says, "Go." We swim in other 400 yards.
[time=3484] I'm thinking, "Why would He ask me that?" We stop at the end of 400 yards, and Jeff says, "What did Christ do for you?" And so I can share out a ignorance of, well, a word of testimony.
[time=3495] The coach says, "Go." Thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour Today.

[time=3511] Jesus Christ, because of God, His Father, had great compassion in coming here to save the lost.
[time=3518] We're all lost.
[time=3520] We need Christ as our Savior.
[time=3522] If you've never accepted Him, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3526] Let's bow together.
[time=3528] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3535] And because of your love, I know that you love me and that you care for me.
[time=3540] And I ask you to come into my heart and save me from my sins and forgive me this day.
