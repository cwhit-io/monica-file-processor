[time=90] (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) Steinberg was working on his famous painting, Christ on the Cross.
[time=116] A bystander was watching him as he made his strokes with a brush.
[time=121] "She said he must have been a wicked man." "Oh no," said Steinberg, "he was a good man." "Then why was he killed and tortured so?" said the watcher.
[time=136] "He died for others," said the artist.
[time=142] "For others," said the spectator.
[time=146] "For whom did he die?" "Did he die for you, Mr. Steinberg?" At that very moment, the artist realized that the character that he was meticulously painting
[time=160] indeed had died for him.
[time=164] Did he die for you?

[time=206] (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) The majesty of the trumpets and the orchestra have called us to worship today.
[time=220] On this Sunday, Easter Sunday morning, we have come because we believe that Jesus Christ is alive,
[time=228] and we've come to worship him today.
[time=231] It's my privilege to ask you to stand that we can sing that great hymn together.
[time=235] Christ the Lord is risen today.
[time=239] (crickets chirping)
[time=421] Let us bow in prayer.
[time=426] Father God, on this Easter Sunday, our hearts are filled with praise at Christ's triumph over death and his resurrection.
[time=436] Lord, we're excited about all the things that that death made possible for us.
[time=441] Lord, we thank you for salvation.
[time=443] We thank you for the fellowship that we can have with one another as we have this in common with Jesus Christ as our Lord
[time=450] and Savior.
[time=452] We pray that as we meet now that we would truly praise and glorify your name and give you the honor this deserving of you.
[time=460] And pray that this would not be set aside only for an Easter Sunday, but for each and every day of our lives.
[time=467] God, we ask in a special way now that your Holy Spirit would meet with us in this service to make our thoughts our praise acceptable in your sight.
[time=478] We thank you for this time in Christ's name, amen.
[time=482] You may be seated.

[time=682] (applause)
[time=690] Inside your bulletin for this morning is written Matthew's account of the resurrection of Christ.
[time=696] It's broken out in a responsive reading.
[time=699] In a moment I would like to ask you to stand to respond to God's Word and to sing the next hymn,
[time=707] and I'll read the part that says worship leader and ask you to read the part that says people.
[time=713] Would you stand right now and we will recite God's Word responsibly and then sing a hymn of worship?
[time=721] After the Sabbath, at dawn, on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
[time=732] (music)
[time=744] His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were wide as snow.
[time=749] The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
[time=756] (music)
[time=766] He is not here. He is risen just as he said.
[time=771] He is not here. He is risen. Howling we do.
[time=778] (music)
[time=1134] The one who said, "I am the great I am." And then he gave himself a sacrifice for men. There is no other name. Let every tongue proclaim and sing the name of Jesus.
[time=1163] magnify and praise the name of Jesus. No other name but Jesus. There is power in the precious name of Jesus.
[time=1182] Jesus, forever he shall reign as king of kings. Lord of all and every living king. From now on we will worship him and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1211] And I am the name of Jesus. There is no other name but Jesus. Oh my Jesus. Forever he shall reign as king of kings.
[time=1239] Lord of all and every living king. From now on we will worship him and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1255] Jesus, Lord of all and every living king.
[time=1273] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour today. This is the most exciting day not only in the life of a church but in the life of the world.
[time=1283] This is the day all creation has been longing for. The day when Jesus Christ arose from the grave. We certainly hope that you have had a joyous Easter season. Peter, how are you this morning?
[time=1295] Just fine. Rick, we started the program with a grand fanfare in that statement. Christ's the Lord has risen today. What a marvelous statement that we as Christians can make on this joyous Easter day.
[time=1306] Oh, we are so excited for the opportunities we have to declare the greatness of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ love for us.
[time=1315] We know that it's Easter morning here but it's one week delayed as you watch it. But we hope the joy and enthusiasm not only stays for a week but it stays for a lifetime.
[time=1326] That as you give your heart to Jesus Christ you know him and the power of his resurrection living in you day by day.
[time=1334] Peter, the music tonight everyone's looking forward to that.
[time=1338] Well, we have a variety of music coming up and we're just delighted that our people commit themselves and sing songs that glorify the cross and of course the resurrection.
[time=1350] And we're going to have unusual events taking place from a reporter coming in and interviewing even the centurion who nailed Jesus to the cross and going back to that time and actually sensing what it must have been like to be there.
[time=1363] And see the blessed Savior nailed to a cruel cross.
[time=1368] Well, that's an event to look forward to.
[time=1371] We want to thank those of you who joined us on Good Friday at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1376] We had between seven and eight hundred people as best we can guess.
[time=1380] But the exciting news is that several people on that day discovered that Jesus Christ really did die for them and they opened up their heart and received him.
[time=1390] And we're so thankful for that.
[time=1392] They now know the satisfaction of eternity.
[time=1396] Satisfaction is the longing of each and every one of our hearts.
[time=1400] And yet most of us go through life trying to find it but never discovering true inner satisfaction.
[time=1408] Would you say at this point in your life you have spiritual satisfaction?
[time=1413] If not, we want to help you to discover how in Jesus Christ you can know the fulfillment of life.
[time=1419] We have a booklet entitled Satisfaction to Share with you.
[time=1423] This booklet was penned by Joe Aldridge, one of the great Bible teachers of our day.
[time=1429] In it he exposes some of the myths.
[time=1432] The things that we ironically put our values in and receive really little are nothing back.
[time=1439] It was Jesus who gave the paradox who said whoever will keep his life will lose it.
[time=1444] And whosoever will lose his life to me will find it, will find satisfaction.
[time=1449] We'd love to give you a copy of this booklet free postage paid.
[time=1453] All you need to do is write and let us know you want a copy.
[time=1457] So we encourage you today to send us a letter and tell us you want the booklet entitled Satisfaction.
[time=1464] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1475] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1484] Thank you again for being a part of this ministry as we shout out the good news that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1492] From time to time we tell you of activities coming up and invite you to come so we can meet face to face.
[time=1498] Over recent months we've invited you to a concert but that's full on the April 30th calendar.
[time=1504] Hickson Cohegan will be with us and many of you have responded to the ticket sales and it is full Rick.
[time=1511] But we're going to have a great time on April 30th and these are the kind of events that we announced to you from time to time
[time=1517] and hope that you can take advantage and be with us and share in these exciting events that we have here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1525] And again we're saddened to report to you that that concert is full but the next time we tell you of a special activity we hope you'll respond quickly.
[time=1533] Thanks again for coming to the Grand Wayne Service and for joining us today and more than anything else remember Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1547] [MUSIC]
[time=1573] The Apostle Paul captured the gospel in a nutshell in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 in verses 3 and 4.
[time=1586] We've asked our church family to memorize that and we've printed it in the bulletin right ahead of the announcements for those friends who are visiting today or those of you who have not had a chance yet to memorize it.
[time=1599] But would you stand now that we could quote from our hearts God's word 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=1605] Would you say the reference with me then quote the text and we'll end with the reference 1 Corinthians 15, 3 and 4.
[time=1614] For what I received I passed unto you as of first importance that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures.
[time=1625] That he was buried and that he was raised from the third day according to the scriptures.
[time=1632] First Corinthians 15, 3 and 4. Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=1662] [MUSIC - 245 seconds]
[time=1914] Our father we have come today to praise your name and holy songs of joy.
[time=1919] We've come to worship you and declare that we love you and we've come to declare our faith in the resurrected Christ and we pray today that his power might be made known in each of our lives today.
[time=1933] We ask you God to take by your spirit captive every heart and every mind that's here.
[time=1939] Cause us to go beyond the hearing of words of preaching of melody and song and God causes today to hear the voice of your spirit speaking to hearts.
[time=1951] May you speak a word of comfort and encouragement to those who are walking through difficulties in marriage, family relationships of health.
[time=1962] We pray this morning for Mark Clough's father that he might recover from a serious internal bleeding condition.
[time=1969] We pray today for little Audrey Richard that you would give recovery to our body and freedom from these seizures.
[time=1976] We pray this morning for those who've lost loved ones that this very day might be a day of victory as their firm faith is fortified in the foundation that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=1989] And may each of us today know him and the power of his resurrection that we might have victorious lives, that we might find that the power of sin can be broken by the resurrected Christ.
[time=2003] For it's in his name that we pray. Amen.
[time=2008] Easter is of course a familiar story to us. It's familiar. We've read it even today as a responsive reading, but not everyone always understands even the most familiar of stories.
[time=2022] It may encourage you to know that the pastor's kid does some of the same things your kids do.
[time=2029] This past week and a half we have really focused in on Easter at the Hawks home. Kathy's a part of the drama that you'll see tonight and she was memorizing her line.
[time=2040] So I was reading her lines and we were practicing in the car as we were driving to visit grandma and our kids are listening to all this.
[time=2048] We read on Monday the Bible story of the triumphal entry in the resurrection and we have primed our children to know about the Lord.
[time=2057] So yesterday Kathy says to Adam, "Adam, do you know what tomorrow is? Kid comes through. Sure do it's Easter. That's right, son. And what's Easter?
[time=2067] Easter's the day the bunny comes and hides a basket in our house." Well, yeah, the bunny doesn't do it, mom and dad do that, but what does it really mean? He didn't have the foggiest idea of what it meant.
[time=2084] So Kathy explains Adam, Jesus died on our sins and he's got that. He understands that. I heard that story a few times and tomorrow is Easter and Jesus arose from the grave.
[time=2098] He has eyes got big. He jumped up, ran in the family room. He said, "Girls, tomorrow Jesus is going to rise."
[time=2107] And the girls looked at him like, you know, I don't really know that stuff. No, mom just said, "Tomorrow Jesus is going to rise."
[time=2116] I'll tell you what, it was exciting to see that little five-year-old come to the realization for the first time in his life that Jesus came back alive.
[time=2127] And more than anything else today, beloved, I hope you can know the excitement that Jesus Christ came alive.
[time=2134] And that is not just a story out of history, but it's something that changes lives today. He's alive.
[time=2142] You read with me this morning, responsibly, from Matthew's account of the gospel.
[time=2147] If you want to use your bulletin, fine, if you want to open your Bible, if you have one, it's Matthew chapter 28.
[time=2153] And in this account, Matthew gives us four aspects of an account that I would want you to see today that I believe can change lives even this Sunday morning.
[time=2166] Matthew 28, I'm going to start reading at verse two.
[time=2171] There was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[time=2181] His appearance was like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
[time=2187] The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
[time=2193] The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
[time=2203] He's not here. He has risen." Just as he said, "Come and see the place where he lay."
[time=2211] And then quickly go tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you in the Galilee.
[time=2217] There you will see him." Now, I've told you.
[time=2223] In this account of the resurrection of Christ, I hope you'll leave today with all the excitement that my son Adam had to know that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=2232] Four things have come to me out of this passage that I would want to share with you this morning.
[time=2238] The first aspect is this is an account of great power.
[time=2244] There are three demonstrations of power here.
[time=2248] The first demonstration is a natural phenomenon, the demonstration of the power of an earthquake.
[time=2254] There are powerful things that you and I have become acquainted with. When we speak of power, we often speak of dynamite.
[time=2262] But you know that a powerful earthquake has more power than 20 tons, not 20 pounds, but 20 tons of dynamite.
[time=2273] And that a powerful earthquake is 100,000 times more powerful than the first atomic bomb that was exploded on earth.
[time=2290] And I believe God used an earthquake as prelude.
[time=2295] As you came in this morning, Scott was at the organ and he was praying, playing a prelude.
[time=2303] The prelude is something that comes to prepare you, to grab your attention and to focus your mind.
[time=2311] And so as that organ would play, you would hear music. Some of that would become familiar and words would come back to your mind and it would focus your attention that we've come the day to worship.
[time=2322] It's Easter, it's resurrection and that prelude sets the stage.
[time=2327] God sent an earthquake as prelude to set the stage that power was about to be revealed.
[time=2337] But there was a second form of power. It says that an angel appeared and so we have angelic power.
[time=2344] And this was real power. It was also radiant power. It was real because the angel rolled back the stone.
[time=2353] This stone was big enough to seal and enclose a cave-like tomb that would be used for multiple burials.
[time=2364] It was something so large that two or three individuals probably could not move it, but the angel could, probably with the flick of a finger, maybe with just a word of the mouth.
[time=2376] But the power was not only real, it was radiant. It says that the radiance was like lightning and that lightning struck the guards so that they shook and became like dead men.
[time=2392] Now if you've ever been around soldiers, they certainly fit the macho type.
[time=2397] I was drafted, went to take my physical and that was my three-hour tour of duty with the army.
[time=2405] I noticed that all of the soldiers had this kind personality. None of them ever learned to speak, but they learned to bark phrases that sounded much like English.
[time=2417] Phrase is like, move on, move on, move on, move on, put your feet on the way to the blue feet.
[time=2422] And now we moved. And every one of those guys were the same way.
[time=2428] And if you put your feet on the blue feet but they weren't exactly right, one of these guys would come over with his bulging biceps and he'd just kind of flex it and stare at you and you'd go whoa, you know, you get your feet right there.
[time=2440] Soldiers are tough men.
[time=2446] And here is a guard of probably 16 soldiers who were probably sitting up all night watching this tomb,
[time=2454] brightening about how many of Hannibal's elephants they threw back across the Mediterranean Sea by themselves.
[time=2462] And suddenly these guys see one angel and the Bible says they begin to shake and then they became like dead men.
[time=2471] You know what that meant? They passed out. 16 of them.
[time=2476] I mean there's power being demonstrated here.
[time=2481] The power of earth in an earthquake, the power of heaven in an angel, but the greatest power here is the power of the resurrection.
[time=2491] They went to the tomb and nobody was home.
[time=2497] The angel announces he is not here. He is risen.
[time=2502] Earthquakes can kill thousands of people.
[time=2506] In 1737 one earthquake in Calcutta took 300,000 people's life in a day.
[time=2514] But no earthquake has the power to give life back to one of its victims.
[time=2522] It takes far more power to give life than to take it.
[time=2527] And the greatest power here is the power of the resurrection.
[time=2532] Why is that so important? Why is it we would speak with such authority about resurrection power?
[time=2540] We speak about it because it's important, first of all because it's the proof of eternal life.
[time=2548] Look out across this auditorium. I know most of you and many of you have walked through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=2558] I've had occasion to walk with some of you to a cemetery.
[time=2564] And there we would place a casket containing the body of your loved one.
[time=2571] And our hearts would fail us except for we believe it's not over.
[time=2579] It's time of separation and we mourn that.
[time=2583] But we believe that that loved one is alive in heaven and our proof Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=2591] And Jesus said I have conquered death.
[time=2597] That's why the resurrection is so important.
[time=2600] But you know it's important for a second reason.
[time=2603] It's not only the proof of eternal life, but the resurrection power that raises the dead is also the power that gives new life today.
[time=2614] If you want to go with me to the book of Romans in Romans chapter 4, the Apostle Paul tells us about how the resurrection power works for you and for me today.
[time=2627] Paul said in verse 24 of Romans 4, "But also for us to whom God will credit righteousness for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
[time=2642] He was delivered over to death for our sins and he was raised to life for our justification."
[time=2652] It's Jesus resurrection that gives the power for justification.
[time=2658] It's Jesus resurrection power that can change your life and mind today and take our life and justify it.
[time=2669] The word justify means that God takes our life.
[time=2672] He knows we're all sinners.
[time=2674] I'm guilty.
[time=2676] And he forgives our sin and he calls us justified.
[time=2681] And one man put it this way.
[time=2683] It's just as if I'd never sinned.
[time=2688] The resurrection is the power that God gives to give us the new birth today.
[time=2695] 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 3 says, "We are called by God by the power of the resurrection."
[time=2702] Do you know today that you can be born again and there is power to take your life and to totally change it?
[time=2711] It's not the power of wishful thinking, it's not the power of positive thinking, it's resurrection power.
[time=2718] The Bible said, "If any man be in Christ is a new creature, you can be made new."
[time=2725] It's also important because resurrection power is the power we have for living a victorious Christian life today.
[time=2734] Romans 8 verse 11.
[time=2737] "And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through the Spirit who lives in you."
[time=2752] That verse is saying this, "You and I are dead men and women."
[time=2759] Now to be honest with you, on some Sunday mornings I would second that statement, but not today.
[time=2766] The Bible says that when we come to Christ we are crucified and we are dead to sin.
[time=2773] That it no longer has power to control us.
[time=2777] As Wesley put it, he breaks the power of canceled sin, he sets the captives free.
[time=2783] His blood can make the vilest clean, his blood avails for me.
[time=2789] And the same power of God that raised Christ from the dead, Paul says, "Now lives in you and makes you alive. It makes me alive."
[time=2799] And as Bill Gather put it, "I've got power that you can't see. I've got Jesus living inside of me."
[time=2808] And you and I have the potential to live broken, unshackled from sin's dominion over us.
[time=2819] And the only way that we can overcome the patterns of sin in our life is by resurrection power.
[time=2826] That's why Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless I live, yet it's not I, but Christ lives in me."
[time=2836] And the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who died for me.
[time=2842] You can have resurrection power today.
[time=2846] Augustine, the theologian of the 5th century, said that when we are born as sinners, we are free to sin.
[time=2856] But because sin possesses us, we are not free, not to sin.
[time=2863] And when we're born again, God's power comes in us, and for the first time in our lives, we are free, not to sin.
[time=2872] That's why Jesus said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
[time=2879] The resurrection power can live in us.
[time=2882] And the message of Easter is a message of great power.
[time=2888] Secondly, it is not only a message of power, it's a message predicted.
[time=2894] If you'll notice, the angel says to them, "He is not here, he has risen, just as he said."
[time=2903] Do you ever notice in life we all have selective perception?
[time=2906] Here's what I mean.
[time=2908] I can walk into the family room, the television's on, the three children are sitting around,
[time=2914] and I say, "Okay kids, in a strong authoritative voice, it's time to clean up, no arguing about who touched what last, who got it out, who belongs to,
[time=2923] just clean up, got it, walk in the other room, nobody moved." Now I'm in the other room with Kathy, and I'm talking in a soft, gentle voice.
[time=2933] I'll say, "Where would you like to go eat?" All three of them dart in, "I want to go to McDonald's, I want burger," and they heard that.
[time=2942] Never heard me say, "Pick this," but they heard, "Where would you like to go eat?" Selective perception.
[time=2949] The disciples were victims of selective perception.
[time=2953] Jesus told them, "Time and time again, I am going to go Jerusalem and suffer and die and be raised to life on the third day, and they heard he's going to die."
[time=2964] And Peter says, "Oh no, you're not, I won't let that happen."
[time=2970] Peter, you don't have to worry about it, I'm going to die, but I'm going to come back, he never heard that.
[time=2976] But Jesus didn't drop that as a subtle little hint one time, it was a reoccurring theme of his talk.
[time=2983] Matthew 12, his adversary said, "Hey, you're asking us to believe your God, you want us to believe you're the Messiah, you give us a proof."
[time=2993] Jesus said, "Fine, just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and rise again."
[time=3004] That's pretty clear stuff.
[time=3007] Matthew chapter 16 verse 21, Jesus pulls his disciples together, it's kind of like time out.
[time=3013] He said, "Let me give you a few critical instructions, I'm going to die and rise again."
[time=3020] Matthew chapter 17, he takes him up to the Mount of Transfiguration, he brings him down, he says, "Now don't go telling anybody until I'm glorified, and I rise from the dead."
[time=3030] Matthew chapter 20, he repeats it again.
[time=3033] And Matthew 26, the night in which he would be betrayed, Jesus said, "You'll see me no more until I am raised from the dead."
[time=3041] Now Jesus dies and they go, "What happens? What's next? We don't know. It's over."
[time=3051] But this was a message that was predicted. Now why is that so important?
[time=3056] Two reasons, very quickly. Reason number one, it's the offered proof.
[time=3061] The adversary said, "What proof do you offer?" He says, "Kill me." They said, "Not a bad idea, and I will raise from the dead." So it's the proof. It was the agreed upon sign that was above every sign.
[time=3076] But more than just an offered proof, it was an opportunity to prevent.
[time=3081] If you were an enemy of Jesus, and he said, "I'm going to rise from the dead, and you just killed him, what would you do?"
[time=3090] If you're smart, you'd make sure he stayed dead, and that's exactly what they did.
[time=3096] If you have your Bible in Matthew 28, just the verses that precede it, the last verses of Matthew 27, tell us this.
[time=3104] Verse 62, "Jesus is dead." The next day, that would be Saturday, died on Friday.
[time=3111] Now Saturday, the next day, the one after preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went the pilot.
[time=3118] So they said, "We remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said, "After three days, I will rise again."
[time=3126] So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.
[time=3130] Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell people that he had been raised from the dead.
[time=3138] This adds to the credibility of the resurrection, because now we have Jesus, not only his allies out of the picture,
[time=3146] but we have his adversaries in the picture saying, "We're going to make sure this thing is silenced once and for all."
[time=3154] So they went to Pilate and Pilate gave them a guard, and as best we understand in history, it was probably a guard of 16 Roman soldiers.
[time=3163] Four shifts of the night, four soldiers per shifts, and they're there at the tomb, making sure the disciples did not steal the body.
[time=3173] That leads us to the third aspect of this message.
[time=3177] It's not only a message of power, a message predicted.
[time=3182] It's a message of proof.
[time=3185] The angel says to the women, "Come and see."
[time=3191] He's not here.
[time=3193] He is risen.
[time=3195] See the place where he lay.
[time=3198] Go to Galilee, take his disciples, and there you will see him.
[time=3202] What great proof, an empty tomb, and a resurrected body.
[time=3207] The critics of the resurrection, those who would like to disprove it, they only have three issues.
[time=3214] Issue number one is to say Jesus really wasn't dead.
[time=3218] One man wrote a work called the Swoon Theory.
[time=3221] It teaches Jesus hung on the cross.
[time=3223] He almost died.
[time=3225] He went into a coma, and they thought he was dead.
[time=3228] They buried him in the tomb, and three days later he said, "I feel like this is going to be a great day."
[time=3236] God up, walked on those broken, pierced feet, took those pierced hands, pushed the stone away,
[time=3243] overpowered sixteen guards, and went on his merry way.
[time=3247] That is the most incredible story.
[time=3249] It takes more faith to believe that than it does faith to believe the resurrection.
[time=3255] A second possibility is that Jesus really died, but he didn't come back to life.
[time=3260] If you can't say throw out the death, then throw out the resurrection.
[time=3264] And what that is, there were five hundred witnesses who saw him at one time,
[time=3270] and when Paul wrote to a hostile audience in Corinth, he said, "They're still alive, you can talk to them."
[time=3278] The third possibility is to discredit the documents.
[time=3281] But if you discredit the documents, you haven't done your homework.
[time=3286] Because you see, the documentation of the New Testament is one of the miracles of history.
[time=3293] We believe that Homer wrote the Illyad and the Odyssey.
[time=3296] We base that on the fact that we have eight partial handwritten manuscripts.
[time=3302] Of the New Testament, there are over forty-two thousand handwritten manuscripts.
[time=3309] We believe that Plato wrote the Republic, and Aristotle is Nicomachean Ethics.
[time=3317] But do you know that if you take all other literature of biblical time and preceding time and add up the documentation for all literature put together,
[time=3326] it is an ankyl compared to the mountain of documentary evidence for the New Testament?
[time=3334] This is a story of great proof.
[time=3337] We have an empty tomb in the living Christ.
[time=3341] And finally, this is a story of personal response.
[time=3349] The angel says to the women, "Come, come and see. See the place where he lay.
[time=3356] It's empty. He's gone. He's risen. Come and see."
[time=3362] So tell us disciples, come to go to Galilee that they can come and see.
[time=3369] And throughout all time, there is one statement of the Scripture that never ends.
[time=3377] It is the one of invitation. Come and see.
[time=3383] You and I do not have the privilege that Thomas had of touching the pierced hands, seeing the pierced feet.
[time=3390] Thomas saw him. He fell to his knees and said, "My Lord and my God." Jesus responded, "Thomas, you believe because you have seen, but I tell you, blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe."
[time=3404] And beloved today on the testimony of Scripture and the evidence of the Spirit in your heart, you can give your life to Christ today.
[time=3412] An artist by the name of Steinberg was painting his great picture called "The Crucifixion of Christ."
[time=3419] He had nearly completed it and a young lady who was a model of his was watching.
[time=3424] She knew nothing of Christ or the events being portrayed on canvas.
[time=3429] She saw the pain of the crucifixion and said, "Oh, he must have been a terrible man."
[time=3436] "Oh no," said the artist. He was not a terrible man. He was a good man.
[time=3442] If he was such a good man, said the young lady, then why did they crucify?
[time=3448] Why did they torture him so? What did he do that he should die that way?
[time=3454] The artist said he did not die for the things that he has done.
[time=3460] He died for the sins of others.
[time=3464] Of others, said the young lady, he died for others and she looked into the face of the artist and said, "Sir, did he die for you?"
[time=3479] And for the first time the artist realized that Jesus Christ died for him.
[time=3487] Did you know that he died? Did you know that he died for you?
[time=3495] This is a message of great power, of prediction.
[time=3500] It's a message of proof, but most of all, it's a message of personal invitation.
[time=3506] He died for you.
[time=3513] It's been a privilege today to share with you triumphal music of the risen Savior.
[time=3518] A special thanks to our sanctuary choir in orchestra and soloist Brian Losen.
[time=3523] The message was from God's word by Pastor Rick Hawks.

[time=3532] I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you right now.
[time=3535] You bow and pray with me, dear Heavenly Father.
[time=3540] Thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3545] Today I heard that message of salvation that you died for me personally.
[time=3552] I ask you to forgive me of my sins and to come into my heart.
[time=3556] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
