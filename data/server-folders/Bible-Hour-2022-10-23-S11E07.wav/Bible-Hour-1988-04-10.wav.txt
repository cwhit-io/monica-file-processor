[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=30] (bells ringing) - She was so gently trying to share her faith
[time=52] and give him the opportunity to know Jesus Christ.
[time=57] But in anger he responded, "Tell me one thing that Jesus Christ "is done for you today.
[time=63] "What has Jesus Christ done for you today?"
[time=69] (bells ringing) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=82] Thank you for joining us.
[time=84] Rick's message today is entitled, "His Ascension." We will be looking at the question, "What has Jesus Christ done for you lately?" You will be encouraged to know all that he has done and all that he is doing for you right now, today.
[time=99] So please open your Bibles and your heart to the Lord as we study his word.
[time=105] Our sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=110] Other special music includes a solo from Denise Mitchell and Kathy Hawks.
[time=119] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=127] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=131] Now, here's Rick.
[time=135] (gentle music)
[time=148] (upbeat music) - And we have come today to glorify the name of our God
[time=163] in all of the earth.
[time=165] We wanna thank you for coming and worshiping with us this morning.
[time=168] We welcome you friends who join us for this hour of praise and a Bible study here at Black Hawk.
[time=175] And we also wanna greet our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=180] Last week was Easter.
[time=182] And as we look at the message of Easter, we never wanna forget that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=189] Yes, we celebrated on that one Sunday, but today and every day we worship him because he is our risen savior.
[time=197] Thank you for being a part of this service.
[time=199] Peter is at a conference in Nashville and Keith Brodigan is so ably helping us out by leading us in worship and in music today.
[time=207] And he's directing the choir as they sing for us this morning.
[time=211] The gateway to his kingdom is the cross.
[time=214] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 259 seconds]
[time=481] - Let's continue our focus upon Christ's redeeming work
[time=494] on At the Cross of Calvary as we sing him number 155, him number 155 at Calvary.
[time=506] (somber music) [MUSIC - 70 seconds]
[time=584] - On the fourth stage of together.
[time=587] [MUSIC - 31 seconds]
[time=623] - You may have noticed last week
[time=629] that we didn't have a new verse printed there in preparation for this week.
[time=633] Our memory verse for this week is the same as we had last week, which is 1 Corinthians 15, 3, and 4.
[time=639] If you will stand, please, let's recite that together.
[time=642] That is found in the inside of the Bolton.
[time=646] If you haven't had the chance to learn it in two weeks, I think I feel a little more shaky on this one having two weeks in the normal one-week timeframe.
[time=653] 1 Corinthians 15, 3, and 4.
[time=658] For what I may see, I pass on to you as a first importance that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures.
[time=670] That he was buried, that he was raised on third day, according to the scriptures.
[time=677] First Corinthians 15, 3, and 4.
[time=681] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=683] (gentle music)
[time=706] [MUSIC - 252 seconds]
[time=987] - I hope you've had a great week.
[time=990] I've had an extraordinary one.
[time=992] I had the privilege of going on Operation Outreach.
[time=996] That is a high school evangelism trip where we took 27 of our sharpest high school students slept on a church floor just like this.
[time=1004] And then in the day, we went to the beach and there met other students and adults and shared with them how they could know Jesus Christ as their savior.
[time=1012] I'll tell you, I haven't had a week that was so challenging.
[time=1016] And at the same time invigorating in a long time, there's a special sense of reality that goes beyond day-to-day living that comes when we share Christ with people.
[time=1028] I want to encourage you to make it your habit of telling others about Jesus Christ.
[time=1033] But before you can tell others, you really have to know him yourself.
[time=1037] Not just know him by accepting the savior, but growing in your walk with God.
[time=1044] For that reason, we have this booklet to share with you today entitled "A Closer Walk." A closer walk tells you how you can daily have a quiet time walking through the New Testament in one year with all of the insights of God's word and illuminated by his spirit and then supplemented with some great comments from Bible teachers of the centuries and of today.
[time=1071] You'll have the insights of men like Augustine, Thomas Aquinas.
[time=1077] You'll hear from Thomas Aquampus.
[time=1079] You'll read of the insights of John Calvin and Martin Luther, G. Campbell Morgan, F.B. Myers, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, just the name of you.
[time=1089] But deep in this is the habit that brings us to a closer walk with God.
[time=1096] If you are like me, you are a creature of habit, some good and some bad.
[time=1102] I want to encourage you to develop the good habit of reading God's word daily.
[time=1107] And a closer walk will help you to achieve that goal.
[time=1110] If you would write to us today, we would send you a copy as a gift from us to you.
[time=1116] Write to us at the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1141] I do hope you'll write and request this booklet a closer walk and we'll send it to you just as quickly as we can so you can begin to study the scriptures with us.
[time=1152] Well, today Peter's gone.
[time=1154] He is in Nashville at a music conference being enriched and gaining insight into ministry for our future here.
[time=1161] And we're so privileged to have Keith Brodigan, who we've heard as a soloist directing our choir and leading us as a congregation in our singing.
[time=1170] We hope that today this broadcast will strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1174] And I want to encourage you to study with us today and find out all that Jesus Christ is done for us and is doing for us and will do for us in the future.
[time=1187] We began the telecast by raising the question, what has Jesus done for you today?
[time=1193] And I'm looking forward to sharing with you how much he has done for you today.
[time=1199] As we go back to our morning worship service, we're continuing the theme of a closer walk as my wife Kathy sings a song that we really enjoy.
[time=1208] Larnell Harris sang it and we learned to love it and she's singing it today.
[time=1212] It's entitled, "I Miss My Time With You." It's written from the perspective of God and man, missing these moments of quiet time.
[time=1223] And God says, "I miss my time with you." Thanks for joining us today and spending this time studying the scriptures and walking with God.
[time=1233] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 86 seconds]
[time=1325] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 148 seconds]
[time=1495] Our God and our Father, we've come today to spend time with you.
[time=1502] To spend time lifting our voices to praise your name.
[time=1507] To spend time hearing your word.
[time=1510] To spend time singing praise.
[time=1514] To spend time listening to a song that honors you.
[time=1518] We want to spend this time with you.
[time=1520] On the first day of this week, God, we've set it aside to say at the beginning of a week, we want to seize the opportunities to spend time with you.
[time=1531] And we want to thank you that you are there, that you are available, that you hear, that you care.
[time=1539] Thank you today for prayer that you have answered in my life this week.
[time=1544] Thank you for the encouragement that came to my heart.
[time=1548] When I gave praise to your name, I was lifted up.
[time=1552] Oh God, I'm thankful today that you have invited me to worship you.
[time=1557] Thank you that you've made us, creatures, capable of knowing you and a finding fulfillment in honoring you.
[time=1567] This week, God, we would ask that you would make your presence real in our life.
[time=1572] That we might sense that Jesus Christ not only is alive in heaven, but that he actually is alive and indwells our hearts.
[time=1581] Give us boldness and confidence this week to know that you direct our steps.
[time=1587] Father, today we pray that that would be a source of comfort to those who are facing some difficulties, to those that this week will face surgery, or the surgery of their child, for those who are facing rejection, then faithfulness of their spouse.
[time=1604] Give them wisdom and boldness, graciousness and discernment.
[time=1609] We pray that your spirit would work in the hearts of men and women who have not repented and who need to.
[time=1615] God, we ask today for your spirit to move.
[time=1620] And we wanna thank you for what you have done and for what you do daily in our lives.
[time=1626] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1629] She was so kind, so gracious as she shared her faith
[time=1636] in the Lord and tried to give him an opportunity to receive Christ, but he neither appreciated her kindness nor the words about Christ and indignantly said, tell me this, what's Jesus done for you today?
[time=1653] Don't tell me history, what's Jesus done for you today?
[time=1658] What if that question were thrown at you?
[time=1662] How would you respond?
[time=1663] What is Jesus done for you today?
[time=1666] Well, it should be enough for us that we could look back and say he died on the cross and he died from my sins.
[time=1674] It should be enough that we would remember, but to be honest with our culture and our society, we don't have good memory.
[time=1682] We have memory that is probably one at the most two days long in terms of gratitude.
[time=1688] I remember hearing coach Volvano say on television.
[time=1691] After they won the national championship at North Carolina State, the fans all told him how much they loved him.
[time=1698] He said, that's great.
[time=1700] Tell me this, will you love me next year?
[time=1702] If we only win half of our games, they said, coach, we'll love you and we'll miss you a lot too.
[time=1708] It's kind of the American way, isn't it?
[time=1712] Short-term memory.
[time=1714] One year ago, Walt Hazard was made coach of the year in the Pac-10 and in the spirit of what have you done for me lately after they didn't win the Pac-10 this year, they fired him.
[time=1726] Earl Bruce was the most winning coach in the Big Ten.
[time=1732] Even after losing four games in a row and after the fourth game, he was unemployed as the most winning coach in the Big Ten.
[time=1742] Many of us look at the Lord Jesus Christ from a skeptical eye and we say, well, that's great that you died for my sins, and almost underplay that, but what have you done for me lately?
[time=1753] Can I tell you that Jesus Christ at this very moment is doing a lot.
[time=1759] As the ascended Christ, he is working in our lives in some marvelous ways today.
[time=1765] We've been studying the life of Christ, and so on Palm Sunday, we studied his triumphal entry and then his death.
[time=1773] Then on Easter Sunday, we studied his resurrection.
[time=1776] Then for 40 days, Jesus was on the earth and Mark simply tells us in Mark chapter 16, these words.
[time=1785] After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God, then his disciples went out and preached everywhere and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.
[time=1805] You know, Matthew doesn't even tell us about the ascension of Christ.
[time=1809] Here Mark only makes a passing statement.
[time=1811] John says nothing, and Luke makes this simple statement in Acts chapter one.
[time=1816] Jesus went out onto a mountain, spoke to his disciples, lifted up his hands and ascended into heaven.
[time=1823] An angel came and said, men of Galilee, why stand ye here idly gazing up into the sky?
[time=1831] This same Jesus who was taken up from among you will come again in a light manner as you have seen him go.
[time=1838] And so with the gospel's ends, the life of Christ, him ascending into heaven.
[time=1845] But in the epistles, those letters of the New Testament, they tell us so much about what Jesus is doing today and what he is doing for you and me in particular.
[time=1857] The first thing that Jesus is doing today I'd like to share for, but the first thing that Jesus is doing today is this.
[time=1865] He has inherited his position.
[time=1869] Mark told us that in that little passage I read to you, it said that he ascended to heaven and he sat down at the right hand of God.
[time=1877] But if you have your Bible, open it to Ephesians chapter one please, and we'll study first of all from this short epistle of Ephesians chapter one.
[time=1886] In Ephesians chapter one, it tells us that Jesus has inherited his position.
[time=1893] I'd like to read verses 18 through 23 but stealing just three thoughts out of verses 20, 21, 22.
[time=1901] Paul says, I pray also that the eyes of your heart
[time=1907] may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints.
[time=1918] And his incomparably great power for us who believe.
[time=1923] That power is like the working of his mighty strength which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms.
[time=1937] Far above all rule and authority, power and dominion and every title that can be given, not only in the present age, but also in the one to come.
[time=1950] And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church which is his body.
[time=1962] The fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
[time=1967] Jesus has inherited his position and that includes at least these three things.
[time=1973] First of all, he has returned to his rightful throne.
[time=1976] Jesus chose to leave heaven.
[time=1980] He was not the victim of a coup d'état.
[time=1983] He was not ousted by a political military regime.
[time=1988] Jesus chose to step up, walk away from his throne and vacate it for 30 some years that he could come to earth and subsequently die on the cross for our sins.
[time=2002] In those 30 plus years, the Bible says that he was despised and rejected.
[time=2008] It said that he was not someone that we would go to because of his attractive countenance.
[time=2014] He was not one of the pretty people.
[time=2016] But he was the son of God.
[time=2020] But he was the son of God out of the position of his throne.
[time=2024] But now he has completed his work.
[time=2028] He has died and he has risen victorious and he's ascended to heaven and he's now seated on his throne at the right hand of God.
[time=2038] Now this can be a little confusing because the Bible clearly teaches that Jesus is God.
[time=2044] And yet we find him seated at the right hand of God.
[time=2048] Now, is he at the right hand of God or is he God?
[time=2051] Well, we use a word to describe this called the Trinity.
[time=2055] The Trinity refers to the fact that God exists as one God but in three separate people.
[time=2065] Now that doesn't work out well.
[time=2066] If you're studying Euclidean mathematics, you know that one plus one plus one does not equal one.
[time=2073] But God is so great, he is so transcendent that there are no philosophical terms that can capture his essence.
[time=2083] There are no mathematical equations that can formulate his character.
[time=2088] And so any words, any numbers that we would use would be inadequate.
[time=2093] And don't allow that to confuse you or to discourage you.
[time=2098] There are so many things in life that we believe yet we don't understand.
[time=2103] I don't understand electricity.
[time=2105] But I believe it's best not to lick my finger and stick it in the light socket.
[time=2110] Don't understand it, but I believe that.
[time=2113] I took math in high school.
[time=2116] Whatever they required, I took.
[time=2117] But they're not too much more.
[time=2119] And I learned in mathematics that there are an infinite number
[time=2125] of whole numbers, but I can't understand that.
[time=2129] I also learned in mathematics that you can keep cutting a number in half.
[time=2136] If you cut one in half, you come up with a half.
[time=2138] If you cut a half in half, you'll come up with a quarter and you can keep cutting it in half.
[time=2143] No matter how many times you have something, it's never all gone.
[time=2146] It doesn't work with my checkbook.
[time=2149] But they tell me it works in mathematics.
[time=2152] Isn't it amazing the number of things that we believe, but yet we can't understand?
[time=2159] God is so great that we can't completely understand.
[time=2163] And so our mathematical equations fall short.
[time=2165] And our philosophical breakdown is inadequate because God is one, but yet He exists in three people.
[time=2173] The father, the son, and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2176] I was reading Alvin Toffler this past week, the great futurist.
[time=2179] He quoted F. Scott Fitzgerald as saying, "The sign of true intelligence is the ability "to hold two counter-dictory thoughts at the same time.
[time=2189] "And we have to have that ability "to even begin to perceive God.
[time=2194] "Jesus is God and He is now seated "in His rightful throne." Second thing this passage tells us of the inheritance of Christ is He's also inherited a new name.
[time=2207] If you notice, it says that He has been positioned, verse 21, far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can ever be given, not only in this present age, but in the age to come, there is a title that is above every title.
[time=2223] It goes beyond mayor, it goes beyond governor, it goes beyond senator, it goes beyond president, it goes beyond every title, it is the name of Jesus.
[time=2234] Last week, Brian and the choir sang so beautifully, there is no other name than Jesus.
[time=2241] Paul said by inspiration of God that Jesus is the only name
[time=2247] that will ever see every knee bow, and will ever hear every tongue confess that He is Lord to the glory of God.
[time=2257] He's been given a name.
[time=2259] He who was despised and rejected, who bore our sorrows and our griefs, has been elevated and given a name that is above every name.
[time=2271] It's as though His name had been marred
[time=2277] and it's now been cleared and lifted high.
[time=2280] One of the most moving things I ever saw on television was the clearing of the name of Jeremiah Denton.
[time=2289] Jeremiah Denton's biography has been told in a book called One Hell was in Session.
[time=2294] It's the story of American military officer tortured in a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam.
[time=2301] And they tried to break him and they tried to break him and they tried to break him and it looked like they did.
[time=2306] And Jeremiah Denton's face was on TV and his voice was making a statement prepared by the North Vietnamese, one denouncing America and it looked like he had given in and his name was lost.
[time=2321] But then one person noticed his eyes were blinking.
[time=2326] One of them says, "Why are his eyes blinking?" And they said, "Well, it's malnutrition." And one of them had the insight to notice that his eyes were blinking in Morse code.
[time=2336] And he sent a message by Morse code with blinking eyes.
[time=2340] And the name Jeremiah Denton was cleared as a hero.
[time=2343] Beloved, there was a time when the name of Jesus is mocked.
[time=2349] It may be in your office today.
[time=2351] There is a time when the name of Jesus is ridiculed.
[time=2353] It might be in your high score, your university today, but there's a day coming when every knee will bow and every tongue will confess to the glory of God that Jesus is Lord.
[time=2365] And God said, "I have an inheritance for you "and Jesus today is inheriting his position." Thirdly, he not only inherits his throne and his title, but he also inherits his rule.
[time=2380] It says that his rule is above all authority, all power, all dominion.
[time=2385] Now theologians have really studied this passage.
[time=2389] Group A say this refers to human leaders that there's no pilot, there's no Caesar, there's no emperor who has more authority than Jesus.
[time=2398] Other theologians say no, these are rankings of angels.
[time=2401] There are rulers and then there are dominions and then there are principalities and there are powers and Jesus is above all those.
[time=2408] Human leaders, some say, angels, others say, and I want to clearly tell you today, I don't have the foggiest idea of which it is.
[time=2416] I mean, you can study all those things, but you know what I do know clearly?
[time=2420] Jesus is above both.
[time=2422] Whether you take those to be earthly leaders or angelic, his name is above everything.
[time=2428] The scripture says and he has a rule overall.
[time=2431] That's what Jesus is doing today.
[time=2435] But here's a second thing that Jesus is doing today.
[time=2438] One even more practical to you and me than all that we've said.
[time=2443] What is Jesus doing today for you?
[time=2446] The Bible says he is indwelling his people.
[time=2451] In Revelation 3.20 is one of the most familiar passages of scripture.
[time=2456] It says this in Jesus' speaking, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=2461] If anyone hears my voice and will open the door, Christ said, I will come in and dine with him and he with me." An artist centuries ago painted that scene so apropos.
[time=2476] It's a picture of a strong stone wall with a rugged wooden door and Christ on the outside knocking.
[time=2484] But so significant, the artist rightfully positioned the door with no door handle on the outside.
[time=2490] For that door, like the door to our hearts, must be open from the inside.
[time=2496] Jesus did not say, "I will huff and puff and blow my way into your house." Now he says, "I stand at the door and knock." Jesus only enters into the lives to which he is invited and he only sits on the thrones which we abdicate in his honor.
[time=2514] But when we do that, Jesus said, "He will come in."
[time=2520] The word we use is indwell.
[time=2521] He dwells in us.
[time=2524] And that gives us, first of all, fellowship with God.
[time=2528] Jesus said, "I will dine with him and he with me." Fellowship is a word we kick around that seldom experience.
[time=2536] Fellowship is not walking down the hallway and say, "Hi, how are you? I'm fine. How are you?" Oh my dog died and my wife left me and my house burnt down.
[time=2544] Great, have a good day.
[time=2546] You don't listen.
[time=2548] Fellowship is not sitting in the same room, eating steel donuts that came out in the same box and downing nasty coffee.
[time=2556] That's not fellowship.
[time=2558] Now if it was pop, that might be fellowship, but not coffee.
[time=2562] That's not fellowship.
[time=2564] You know when fellowship comes is when wives are shared together.
[time=2568] And there's not too much more intimate of sharing than to open up your home and to open up your table and sit together.
[time=2579] I never experienced fellowship like that until you gave me the privilege of going to Japan and staying at the home of a Christian brother by the name of Mr. Hordayuchi.
[time=2589] We stayed in this home four days and on that fourth night, we had been growing together as brothers in Christ and we sat down for our first meal at their table.
[time=2599] It was a different table, not a table like you and I would set.
[time=2603] For this table, there were not individual plates.
[time=2605] There was just one large bowl and we each had our chopsticks.
[time=2611] Now that may sound a little crude to you, but don't see it that way.
[time=2615] Mr. Hordayuchi sat down and we sat around this table with one bowl and he explained that he knew that this was different for us.
[time=2622] He knew that we were used to individual plates, but he said, "In Japan, we eat out of one bowl because we are one family." And then he looked at you and he said, "My brother, you are my family.
[time=2635] You will eat of my bowl." And that intimacy, that bonding, and that's what Jesus said, "I will come into your life and I will die with you." Jesus offers us the indwelling of his spirit as fellowship.
[time=2656] Not only does the indwelling Christ give us fellowship, it gives us great comfort.
[time=2662] Jesus said, "I will pray the Father." That's what he told his disciples is.
[time=2668] He was about to leave them.
[time=2669] He said, "I will pray the Father and he will send you another comforter, even the spirit of truth, who will be in you." That word comforter is actually two little Latin words squished together and make one English word.
[time=2685] The word comes, "COM," is actually in Latin, "CUM," it means "with." The word "fort" "fortis" means "to brave." And what God says his spirit will do in our heart is he will brave with us the storms of life.
[time=2701] That regardless of the adversity you face this week, Jesus said, "I'll go with you." I will brave that event by your side.
[time=2710] I will be with you.
[time=2712] Indwelling Christ also gives to us power.
[time=2719] Do you have your Bible turned to Romans chapter eight.
[time=2722] Romans chapter eight, verses nine through 11, tell us of the power that is ours by the indwelling of Christ.
[time=2733] Romans eight, verse nine.
[time=2736] You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature, but by the spirit if the spirit of God lives in you.
[time=2745] And if anyone does not have the spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ, he does not have the spirit.
[time=2753] But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.
[time=2761] And if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through the spirit who lives in you.
[time=2775] The indwelling of Christ, not only gives us fellowship with God and comfort, but it gives to us power.
[time=2783] This passage says that we have an old nature, which because of sin is dead.
[time=2791] By dead in this verse, it means it is incapable of spiritual life.
[time=2798] But God's spirit comes into us and in this dead body, now his spirit makes it come alive.
[time=2808] Now the good news is Christ lives in us, the bad news is so does the old nature live in us.
[time=2815] And in Galatians 5, 17, it says the spirit wars against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit and the to our contrary, and you cannot do that which you would.
[time=2827] There is a civil war taking place today in my life and in yours as the spirit and the old nature battle it out and hammer it out.
[time=2841] Craig Massey used these words in his book, "Adjust Ourself Destruct." I've shared them with you before, a good reminder though.
[time=2849] It says, "Two natures beat within my chest.
[time=2854] "The one is cursed, the other is blessed.
[time=2858] "The one I love, the other I hate.
[time=2861] "The one I feed will dominate." That's why it's so important, that song that you heard this morning.
[time=2868] I miss my time with you.
[time=2870] For you see, if we don't spend time with God in prayer, in word, in fellowship with his people, we are starving the spirit and when we spend time in front of the idiot box and reading the magazines of society that tell us that you'll only be happy if you have more, you'll only be successful if you do it this way, we're feeding the old nature.
[time=2893] Who will win, whoever we feed.
[time=2898] But this power says Christ lives in us and he empowers us to live a spiritually victorious life.
[time=2907] What's Jesus done for you lately?
[time=2911] He has moved in your heart and he lives there with you
[time=2917] to give you fellowship and comfort and power.
[time=2920] Let me share a third thing with you that Jesus is doing today.
[time=2924] He's not only inherited his position, he's not only indwelling his people, he's also interceding for his people.
[time=2932] Now, the word intercession is not one we use a great deal.
[time=2936] It means to go in between, inner between Kedal to march in between.
[time=2944] Jesus says he's gone in between.
[time=2947] Now, a lot of you don't know a lot about language but you know a lot about football.
[time=2951] The word intercession comes from the same Latin word as our word interception.
[time=2957] So when you picture the quarterback, he drops back, he throws the ball, the ends out there and he jumps up the kitchen.
[time=2963] And in the last moment that defensive back comes in and he takes the ball away, that interception, that means he came in between.
[time=2971] The Bible says that Jesus comes in between our sins and our holy God and he intercedes.
[time=2982] There are two different roles that Jesus has as intercessor.
[time=2986] The first is found in Hebrew.
[time=2988] So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Hebrews, chapter two.
[time=2992] Jesus intercedes first as our high priest.
[time=2999] Most of us come from rather gentile backgrounds and know little about the priest to it.
[time=3004] But in the Old Testament, there was a day of atonement called Jan Kapoor, the day of atonement.
[time=3012] On that one single day of the year, the high priest and only the high priest could enter the holy of holies and only on this one day.
[time=3024] And he would walk through the outer temple, into the inner temple and he would pull back the veil of the holy of holies and there he would take the blood of a sacrificed animal and he would sprinkle it on the mercy seat.
[time=3038] And that sacrifice was given by the high priest who was interceding between God and the people.
[time=3046] The Bible says that Jesus is our ultimate high priest.
[time=3050] He was the perfect highest priest who gave the ultimate perfect sacrifice himself and he interceded between us and God.
[time=3059] Now look at Hebrews chapter two, verse 14.
[time=3063] Since the children have flesh and blood, he Christ too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death.
[time=3075] That is the devil.
[time=3077] And free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death.
[time=3083] For surely it is not angels he helps but Abraham seen.
[time=3088] For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people because he himself suffered when he was tempted.
[time=3107] He is able to help those who are being tempted.
[time=3112] This passage says that Jesus is now our permanent high priest and he is making intercession for us helping us because of our sins to stand before God.
[time=3125] The Bible says that he took on humanity and he suffered and he was tempted in every way just like we are.
[time=3133] You know it's so comforting when someone really knows how you feel.
[time=3138] When you lose a loved one, greater comfort comes from the one who has also lost a loved one than from one who has good information.
[time=3150] But you see it's not just information that we need in life.
[time=3153] We also need empathy.
[time=3156] We need not only ones who can give us the facts.
[time=3160] We need one who understands our feelings and such is the Lord Jesus.
[time=3165] Two chapters later in Hebrews 4 verse 14 it says, therefore since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firm to the faith we possess for we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet without sin.
[time=3191] Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence
[time=3197] that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in the time of need.
[time=3202] The Bible says is our high priest, Jesus intercedes for us, he gives us two things to help us.
[time=3209] They sound alike but they're very different.
[time=3212] Mercy and grace.
[time=3215] Mercy is God not giving us what we deserve.
[time=3220] I deserve hell and out of God's mercy he says, "I won't give that to you." Grace is God giving us the good things.
[time=3227] We do not deserve, God says you deserve hell but out of mercy I won't give you that and out of grace I'll give you what you don't deserve heaven.
[time=3235] And in our lives Jesus not only died on the cross for sins
[time=3241] but Hebrews 7.25 says that he lives today to make intercession for us.
[time=3248] Therefore he is able to save completely.
[time=3251] That means once Jesus saves you and you're brought in the family of God he's able to save you completely that we'd call that eternal security.
[time=3260] He would hold you secure because those of us who come to God through him because he Christ always lives to intercede.
[time=3271] So in my life as a believer I still sin but my sins are covered because Jesus intercedes again and again and again.
[time=3281] Jesus intercedes for us as our high priest but there's a second way that Jesus intercedes and that is as our defense attorney.
[time=3291] The Bible says that heaven has a courtroom like seeing
[time=3297] and the judge of the whole earth is God.
[time=3299] That's told to us in Genesis Psalm 78, Psalm 96.
[time=3303] Here in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 25, God is the judge.
[time=3308] And in Revelation 12, 9 it says that Satan is the accuser of the brethren.
[time=3316] He's the district attorney, no offense to the district attorney or his office.
[time=3322] But Satan comes before God and he says, God is judge, I bring these charges against Rick Hawks to you and you know what, I'm guilty.
[time=3336] But here's what first John two one says, beloved,
[time=3343] these things I write unto you that you sin not but if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
[time=3352] The Bible says that he intercedes as our advocate and as Satan brings that charge, Jesus steps up to the bench and he says, Heavenly Father, eternal judge, we plead guilty to that crime but the punishment for that crime was already paid when I died on the cross for that sin and I'm here to intercede.
[time=3380] What a difference someone who intercedes can make.
[time=3384] A number of years ago I was visiting in a jail and I'd made all the phone calls to get in and to visit this particular individual and when I got there somebody else was on duty and they wouldn't let me in and I tried to be polite and I tried to be firm, I couldn't get in.
[time=3399] They said, you can't come in.
[time=3401] I started to leave, don't on me.
[time=3404] I know the sheriff, so I called the sheriff and I said, sheriff, I'm in jail.
[time=3410] He said, you need a good bail bondsman?
[time=3413] I said, no, no, no, I'm here to visit somebody and they said, I can't get in.
[time=3418] He put me on hold, used another line and the guard came out and said, Pastor Hawks, it'd be alright if you'd like to come in now.
[time=3428] Isn't it great when you know somebody and beloved right now there's one accusing you of every foul word you've said, of every filthy thought you've ever had, of every little deed that you've done that was wrong there's one accusing you today but you know somebody.
[time=3446] You know Jesus Christ, your advocate and when Satan accuses you, he'll intercede for you right now.
