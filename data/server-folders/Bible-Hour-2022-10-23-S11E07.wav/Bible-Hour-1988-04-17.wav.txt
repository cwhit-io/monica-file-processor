[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] Before Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave this promise,
[time=113] "I will come again," and as He described His coming He said the day would be a day,
[time=120] marked with signs, and today.
[time=123] This very day is a day that fits the description that Jesus gave of His coming perfectly.
[time=130] I'm looking forward to telling you why this day matches the signs of Jesus coming.
[time=137] (music playing)
[time=147] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=151] Thank you for joining us.
[time=153] Rick's message today is entitled, "His Rescue of the Church." Jesus is coming again.
[time=159] Yes, that is exactly what He promised us, His Church.
[time=162] As the days grow more distressing, we have this hope.
[time=165] Keep your eye on the eastern sky, lift up your head, redemption draw of nine.
[time=170] Our study today in the life of Christ is His Rescue of the Church.
[time=174] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=178] Our text today is First Thessalonians.
[time=181] Our sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=185] Other special music includes a song from the Men's Singers Quartet, and Lynn Rawell.
[time=192] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=199] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=204] Now, here's Rick.
[time=205] Delighted that you've come to the Black Hawk Baptist Church to worship the living Savior today.
[time=211] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=216] We trust that this next hour that we spend together would first of all bring praise and honor to the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and then secondly would be a time of spiritual
[time=227] refreshment and challenge for each of us who participate.
[time=232] The Bible describes Jesus Christ as God's lamb who gave his life for our sins.
[time=239] That's been beautifully put to music under the title Lamb of God.
[time=261] Son knows sin too high, but you have sent Him from your side to walk upon this guilty
[time=276] star, and to become the Lamb of God.
[time=290] And to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be.
[time=340] one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his
[time=353] life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for
[time=372] the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one
[time=400] his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life
[time=441] to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the
[time=464] gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his
[time=470] life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the
[time=470] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 50 seconds] life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the one who gave his life for us to be the ...
[time=529] [MUSIC - 63 seconds]
[time=597] - This year as a church,
[time=604] we've coveted to encourage each other to study God's word and to memorize it.
[time=609] And because of that, we have a scripture verse each week that we recite.
[time=614] If you're visiting with us, that verse can be found at the top of your bulletin.
[time=618] Would like you all to stand please as we recite the verse for the week.
[time=621] Hebrews 725, therefore he is able to save completely
[time=630] those who come to God through him
[time=636] because he always lives to intercede for them.
[time=641] Hebrews 725.
[time=644] Very good.
[time=644] I hope that's encouraging each other as you listen to your neighbor saying those verses.
[time=648] Let that be a further encouragement for you in the faithfulness of God's word.
[time=652] Thank you.
[time=653] You may be seated.
[time=654] (upbeat music)
[time=671] (soft music)
[time=701] [MUSIC - 80 seconds]
[time=789] (soft music) [MUSIC - 108 seconds]
[time=903] - Well, we're delighted to have you joining us today
[time=917] for the Bible Hour, and we certainly hope that this hour of music and study of the scriptures encourages your heart and strengthens your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=927] Good morning, Pete, and welcome back.
[time=929] - Good morning, Rick, it's great to be back.
[time=931] We had a good time at a music conference and then I got back Friday and the quartet and I got in the van and drove four hours up to Michigan and it was great to be with my friends again and our people here at Blackhawk, we love all of them.
[time=943] - Well, we're glad you're back and looking forward to the men's singer singing again in just a few moments.
[time=949] Right now, we'd like to take a moment to encourage you to set Wednesday nights aside this summer for our summer Bible Conference.
[time=957] We have some exciting events coming up.
[time=959] Let me just share three highlights of the summer with you.
[time=962] The first two weeks of June on Wednesday night, Dr. John Davis, president of Grace College will be here, speaking on prophetic themes.
[time=970] One week he'll be talking about what are the signs of the end times and the second week will be what will the role of America be in the last days.
[time=980] Then we have the film series with Harold Morse speaking about his life twice pardoned.
[time=987] This man has had a great ministry as a convicted criminal turned to Christ.
[time=993] Perhaps you've heard about him as he's given his testimony often on Dr. Dobson's program, Focus on the Family.
[time=1001] Then in July, we have George Sweeting, former president of Moody Bible Institute coming in.
[time=1006] These will be great opportunities to strengthen your faith on Wednesday nights this summer and I'm looking forward to that.
[time=1012] - Well, Rick, the film series is a great challenge.
[time=1015] It's got to prick anybody's heart to realize the devastation of sin in any form and how it can change your life yet how God can come in and take that away if we'll just let him.
[time=1026] That's a great series and Dr. Sweeting is just a fine individual and a marvelous pastor and teacher and I'm looking forward to him as am I.
[time=1035] Today we want to encourage you to have the habit of being in God's word daily.
[time=1040] From time to time I meet many of you as I'm out shopping at the mall or even at an athletic event and you tell me how the Bible hour encourages your life and we're thankful to know that.
[time=1051] But one hour of television a week does not make a full spiritual diet and each of us need to be regularly studying God's word.
[time=1059] Most of us have the desire but not the wherewithal, the willpower and the formula and the plan and so we make available to you a booklet called Closer Walk and its theory is that if you'll be in God's word you will indeed have a closer walk.
[time=1076] This attractive booklet guides you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1081] It requires about a chapter day of reading and then gives you some of the insight of great men of God who've taught his word over the years.
[time=1090] We want you to be in God's word so much that we'll send you your first month's copy free if you'll simply write to us and ask for it.
[time=1097] Pete, would you tell our friends how they can get their copy?
[time=1100] Yes, we'd like to encourage you to write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East state, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1110] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East state, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1118] Certainly reading God's word and being close to the Lord Rick is an encouragement on a daily basis and we all need it.
[time=1124] Well, last week, Kathy sang the song, "I miss my time with you" and Pete just told me this morning that in the awards for Christian music, that was the song of the year.
[time=1134] But more than it being a song of the song of the year, we hope it's the story, the story of your life that you spend time with God.
[time=1142] Thanks for being with us today.
[time=1144] As we go back, Lynn Rowe will be singing for us, the men's singers, and then we'll be studying about the Lord Jesus Christ, his second coming, his rescue of the church.
[time=1156] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 211 seconds]
[time=1377] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 82 seconds]
[time=1466] - Our precious Jesus, we come to you this morning
[time=1475] because you have invited us, and we want to thank you for your love.
[time=1483] It is beyond our comprehension to think that you died for us, and we want to thank you for that.
[time=1492] We want to thank you today that you and well us and intercede for us.
[time=1499] We ask you today, precious Lord, to take our hand to lead us on, to help us stand.
[time=1506] We pray that through this hour of worship and study, that there would come a determination of our own souls to live for you.
[time=1518] Help us today to learn to die to ourself that we might live in newness of life.
[time=1526] Father today, we pray that your spirit would encourage those who are walking through the dark valleys, those who are perhaps unemployed or underemployed.
[time=1538] Pray for those who manage in business
[time=1544] and their decisions affect the lives of others that you would give them that balance between fiscal responsibility and people's sensitivity.
[time=1554] Father today, we pray for those whose home lives are strained, that you would be a source of healing, that you would change hearts, redirect values.
[time=1568] Pray this morning that you would encourage those who are sick, pray particularly for Judy Griffith and for Mrs. Lockwood as they are in hospital rooms.
[time=1580] For Fred and Viola Gas skills, they move into nursing care.
[time=1584] We pray today that you would comfort and encourage each heart.
[time=1588] We ask today that your spirit lead us and you guide us.
[time=1594] [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=1723] - Thank you, men.
[time=1735] Some of the most inspiring words of military history were those of Douglas MacArthur on Kuregador as he said to the nation of the Philippines, "I shall return." There was that American determination, that force of character and there came a spirit both amongst the Filipinos and the Americans that in the future there was a coming day to be anticipated.
[time=1764] MacArthur had said it, "I shall return." But did you know that those great words of inspiration were borrowed?
[time=1772] Those weren't original lines that MacArthur would say.
[time=1776] Actually, the very message that MacArthur would give was borrowed from the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[time=1782] As MacArthur was preparing to leave the Philippines,
[time=1788] he knew the only encouragement that he could give that nation was the promise of his personal return.
[time=1794] 1940 years before MacArthur, Jesus Christ,
[time=1800] had spent his life with his disciples.
[time=1803] He had amassed around him a body of people that knew of personal loyalty, but he had to give them a message they did not want to hear.
[time=1813] The message that Jesus gave that was so repugnant was this.
[time=1817] Jesus said, "I am going to die, and after I die,
[time=1823] "I will be buried, I'll raise again, "and then I'll go to my father who is in heaven." The thought of Jesus' personal withdrawal was overwhelming to his disciples, but here's what he told them.
[time=1838] Let your heart be not troubled.
[time=1841] Neither let it be afraid.
[time=1843] Jesus said, "You believe in God believe also in me.
[time=1848] "In my father's house, there are many mansions.
[time=1851] "If it were not so, I would have told you.
[time=1855] "I go and prepare a place for you "that you might be with me also, "and I will come again and receive you unto myself.
[time=1867] "Jesus promised, I will come again."
[time=1874] We've been studying since pre-Christmas days, the life of Christ, and in a chronological way, we've moved through that till we came last week to his ascension in heaven, and we noted that Jesus did four things.
[time=1889] Once he ascended to heaven, first of all, he inherited his rightful place.
[time=1894] He's at the right hand of God in a throne in glory.
[time=1898] Secondly, Jesus indwells.
[time=1901] That means he actually, by his spirit, lives inside each of us who are his children.
[time=1907] Thirdly, the Bible says that Jesus is always interceding for you and for me.
[time=1914] And fourthly, the ascended Christ is implementing his plan for eternity.
[time=1921] The plan that Jesus has for eternity is that he's coming again.
[time=1929] If you have a Bible, we invite you to open your Bible with us to Matthew chapter 24, and this chapter deals with Jesus' dialogue with his disciples about his coming kingdom and the events that precede it and mark it.
[time=1948] Allow me to read first for you, verses one through three.
[time=1952] Jesus left the temple and walking away with his disciples,
[time=1958] they came to him and called his attention to its buildings.
[time=1962] Do you see all these things?
[time=1966] He asked, "I tell you the truth.
[time=1968] "Not one stone here will be left on another.
[time=1972] "Everyone will be thrown down." As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately.
[time=1981] "Tell us," they asked.
[time=1985] "When will this happen?
[time=1989] "And what will be the sign of your coming "and of the end of the age?" Question and answer time with Jesus.
[time=1998] I would give anything, and I'm sure you would too, to be able to sit down with Christ and say, "Lord, I've been confused by all these preachers "like hawks all my life.
[time=2006] "Give it to me straight." The disciples had that privilege.
[time=2010] They said, "Lord, you tell us, "what are the signs to look for for your coming "and for your kingdom?" And the rest of this chapter is Jesus' response.
[time=2023] I believe that verses four through 14 are Jesus' description about what I will call pre-tribulation events.
[time=2035] And then verses 15 through 31 are tribulation events.
[time=2040] And then verses 32 to the end of the chapter are Jesus' rescue of the church.
[time=2048] Now, if you have your bulletin, you might want to flip it over 'cause we've given you a little chart on the back.
[time=2052] As we look at the end times, the Bible gives us somewhat of a chronology that I would like to give to you in a timeline.
[time=2063] So let's move back in time all the way to the death burial resurrection of Christ.
[time=2070] We can put that on our timeline right here.
[time=2074] Jesus Christ died for our sins.
[time=2077] He was buried and he rose again victorious.
[time=2081] The next thing he did was ascend to heaven.
[time=2084] Following the removal of Christ from earth is an indefinite period of time.
[time=2090] We don't know how long it's gonna last from this point into the future.
[time=2094] It's gonna be at least 2,000 years.
[time=2097] It could be 2,000 years.
[time=2100] It could be three.
[time=2101] It could be any number of years.
[time=2103] We do not know.
[time=2105] We call this intervening period of time the church age.
[time=2110] Because this is the time that Jesus is building his church and building the church has nothing to do with the building project across the street.
[time=2120] The word church actually means assembly, not the place where you assemble.
[time=2125] You are the church.
[time=2126] This is the church's building.
[time=2128] And so this is an age where Jesus is calling people to himself and he's building his church.
[time=2135] He's assembly of believers.
[time=2137] The Bible tells us the next age that comes, we don't know when it is, that ends this church age is called the tribulation.
[time=2146] We know how long it is.
[time=2148] The Bible tells us it's seven years.
[time=2151] But there is an event that immediately precedes the tribulation.
[time=2158] We call it in our theological terms, the rapture.
[time=2162] Now, the word rapture is simply the English form of a Latin word rapio, which means to snatch.
[time=2169] We call it the rapture because the Bible says that just before the tribulation, Jesus is going to come to the clouds and he's gonna snatch all believers.
[time=2180] The bodies of dead believers will be brought back to life and living believers on earth will all be caught up together in the clouds and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[time=2190] That happens immediately prior to this tribulation that then lasts seven years.
[time=2198] At the end of these seven years, the Bible tells us that Jesus will come again, not to the clouds, but right to the earth and he will establish his kingdom on earth for 1,000 years.
[time=2211] And again, it's Latin.
[time=2212] Latin melise means thousand anem means year.
[time=2216] So we call that kingdom the millennium, 1,000 year reign of Christ.
[time=2221] Over the next three Sundays, starting today, we're gonna talk about Christ's rescue of the church, then his wrath on the earth, the tribulation, then his reign, overall, the millennium.
[time=2235] Those events are partially revealed to us here in Matthew chapter 24.
[time=2240] Matthew chapter 24, we've got three sections.
[time=2244] Pre-tribulation events, tribulation events, rescue of the church, will take several weeks, but let's move quickly.
[time=2253] First of all, in verses four through 14, he gives us six characteristics of the world just prior to the tribulation.
[time=2265] Look at verse four and you'll come to the first one.
[time=2269] They've asked in verse three, when will this happen?
[time=2273] And what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age Jesus answered, watch out that no one deceives you.
[time=2284] For many will come in my name claiming, "I am the Christ and will deceive many." The first of the six signs of the pre-rapture events is false Christ.
[time=2301] You and I should not be surprised when we pick up the newspaper and we read that there's a man from Korea by the name of Sun Me Young Moon, who announces, "I am the Lord of the second advent.
[time=2314] "I am the Messiah.
[time=2315] "I am Christ, come back." That is totally wrong, but we shouldn't be surprised that he does it.
[time=2325] Nor should we be surprised that tens, even hundreds of thousands of people follow him because Jesus had watched out that you're not deceived because many will come saying, "I am the Christ and many will follow them." One of the characteristics of the last days before Christ returns is this.
[time=2344] It's a time of great religious deception and that religious deception will be bought and sold with great popularity.
[time=2355] It will be a time when we find all kinds of new personalities who offer messianic expectations and they are false Christ, not the real Christ, false ones and it's characteristic of their age.
[time=2371] So don't be alarmed or discouraged and certainly don't be surprised as you see false religion growing and growing and growing and then take this practical insight.
[time=2383] Don't be surprised that a ministry that lacks character and integrity prospers.
[time=2390] I mean, don't be surprised if you care of a minister who has great appeal but has no character in his life.
[time=2398] There is no correlation between somebody being godly and being scriptural and necessarily being successful.
[time=2406] Adolf Hitler was a tremendous success at motivating people to follow him.
[time=2411] Success and spirituality do not go hand in hand
[time=2417] and in the end times, the deception will be great.
[time=2419] Second characteristic Jesus gave was the fear of war.
[time=2425] Notice this, verse six.
[time=2428] You will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed, such things must happen but the end is still to come.
[time=2441] Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
[time=2446] Second sign of the pre-tribulational era is that we'll be in time of intense fear over war and a time where wars are numerous.
[time=2458] We fit that description in a remarkable way since 1945.
[time=2465] If you see before 1945, war was what we feared.
[time=2470] Since 1945, what we fear is the fear of war.
[time=2477] Because you see there are wars all over the place on this globe today that you and I do not fear.
[time=2483] You and I do not fear the fact that there has been a war for 10 years between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union and it looks like it's ended and we say, oh.
[time=2494] You and I have not really feared over a war between the Sandinistas and the Contras in Nicaragua.
[time=2499] It's over, it appears and we say, oh.
[time=2503] But what you and I really fear is the potential war when powers like the United States and the Soviet Union release their megaton weaponage that is measured in world destructions.
[time=2520] That's what we fear.
[time=2523] And this is an era where we have the fear of war.
[time=2528] There's a third description of these days.
[time=2530] Jesus said it's a time of famines and natural disaster.
[time=2534] Look at verse seven, nation rises against nation, kingdom against kingdom.
[time=2540] There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
[time=2544] All these things are the beginning of birth pangs.
[time=2548] The third thing that Jesus puts his finger on is even in a technological age such as ours, when lights never go out, although the guys in the control room plan that, but there will be natural disasters.
[time=2561] There'll be earthquakes, there'll be phenomenon that we can't alter, that we can't change.
[time=2567] But this Jesus said is not the tribulation.
[time=2571] It's just the prelude.
[time=2572] He said it's like a woman who is expecting who goes through those early contractions.
[time=2577] The baby's not coming, but there's some contractions that tell you, don't forget your pregnant.
[time=2582] The earth will go through some pre-tribulational contractions,
[time=2588] but this is not the end.
[time=2591] Jesus said this is all pre-tribulational.
[time=2594] The fourth thing that will encounter is fatal attacks on Christians.
[time=2601] I'll read it for you since you can no longer see your Bible in the dark.
[time=2605] Verse nine, "Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me." Jesus said in the end times, the persecution against the church will multiply.
[time=2624] You and I suffer from the fact that we have a very provincial view of Christianity where we should have a very global view of Christianity.
[time=2634] To you and I, suffering for Christ is one of those hot August days here at Black Hawk when the air conditioning doesn't work.
[time=2642] That's what we consider pre-tribulational conditions.
[time=2645] But if you have a global view, you remember Harry Lee addressing us last summer, and how he told us he was locked in a bamboo prison behind the bamboo curtain of communist China, and how he was tortured year after year, and how many were executed.
[time=2667] You will remember the testimony of Georgie Vims as they spoke of persecution behind the Iron Curtain.
[time=2674] You'll hear the testimony of some of the people of our own church who have escaped from Germany where the church is literally persecuted.
[time=2684] You see, our view of Christianity is like our view of economics.
[time=2688] Back in 1981, when things weren't so good for Wayne, I heard this economic definition, the difference between a recession and a depression.
[time=2698] A recession is when you are out of a job, a depression's when I am out of a job.
[time=2704] And that's how we really view persecution.
[time=2707] Persecution is real when it's on you, but it's bad when it's on me.
[time=2712] Persecution takes place now.
[time=2715] The fifth thing that Jesus says is there will be a falling away of believers.
[time=2723] Verse 11, verse 10, excuse me.
[time=2730] At that time, many will turn away from the faith and will betray each other, and false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
[time=2740] Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
[time=2747] Fourth characteristic, falling away of, quote, Christians, end quote.
[time=2753] Five different descriptions are given here.
[time=2756] One, they will turn away.
[time=2759] Those who look like they've always been Christians, maybe they've sat next to you in church, will fall away.
[time=2766] They'll turn their back on Christ.
[time=2768] Their rejection of Christ then will turn to a rejection of their former associates, you and me.
[time=2775] It says they will betray and then thirdly hate each other.
[time=2780] The fourth thing that will happen, false prophets, false teachers will appear and deceive many.
[time=2787] And finally, the love of tragically most will grow cold.
[time=2792] You see, in Christianity, we are a mixed lot.
[time=2797] There are those here in this very room today who have given their heart to Christ clearly, and there are those who today are here who have not given their life to Christ, but it clearly appears that they have.
[time=2812] You see, the Bible warns us time and time again, there are those who truly possess Christ, mixed in with those who only profess to know Christ.
[time=2823] And when these hard days come, pardon the expression, there is a real separation between the men and the boys, between the believers and the pretenders.
[time=2837] And Jesus adds this personal admonition, those who stand firm to the end will be saved.
[time=2844] We believe the scripture teaches that all who truly come to Christ, Christ told them and we're never lost because he's got me, not because I've got him.
[time=2855] This passage is telling us that during the persecution, we will be tried and tested and true believers will be found out, and they will be the ones who stand firm to the end.
[time=2868] There is a sixth sign of these pre-tribulation events, and that is full exposure to the gospel, verse 14.
[time=2878] And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached to the whole world as a testimony to our nations, and then the end will come.
[time=2889] World-wide evangelization, the gospel preached globally.
[time=2894] Now here are those six characteristics very quickly.
[time=2899] False Christ who are popularly received, fear of war, famine and disaster, fatal attacks on Christians, falling away of the church in a full exposure of the gospel.
[time=2919] Those are the characteristics, but notice again what Jesus said in verse six.
[time=2926] Don't be alarmed, such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
[time=2930] This is not the end.
[time=2932] Verse seven, the famines and earthquakes will take place, but these are the beginning of the birth pangs, not the actual birth.
[time=2940] Then when you come to verse 14, it says, "And then, after these six things and then the end will come." So all of these things are characteristic of the world before Jesus comes and rescues the church.
[time=2958] Now immediately in verses 15 through 31, Jesus gives us a full description of the tribulation.
[time=2966] That'll be our study next week, but I wanna jump over the tribulation and bring you to a further discussion of Christ that begins in verse 32.
[time=2975] He's given him this panoramic view that started over here and moved all the way through the tribulation.
[time=2982] And now look at verse 32.
[time=2985] Now learn this lesson from the fig tree.
[time=2989] As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
[time=2995] Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near right at the door.
[time=3001] I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
[time=3008] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
[time=3012] Now that Jesus has finished the chronology, he says, now, I'm going back to your original question.
[time=3020] Jesus said, you wanted to know the sign, when is it gonna happen?
[time=3023] He said, now I've given you the sign and he uses the illustration of the seasons of the year.
[time=3030] You go through winter, you and I know winter.
[time=3032] It's that cold, cold, snowy, miserable time.
[time=3037] You come to spring, we say, what's spring on?
[time=3039] Well spring, the weather gets warmer, the days get longer and it's nicer out.
[time=3044] Summer, it's scorchingly hot.
[time=3047] But you know what, if you live in the Middle East, you don't have those signs.
[time=3050] I lived in Southern California and I discovered one day on my way to playing tennis that it was December the 1st.
[time=3060] And you guys had gone from summer to fall and it was winter and it was still summer in California.
[time=3069] If you live in Israel, you don't have the signs of the change of climate, it does not change.
[time=3076] But if you look at a fig tree, you know, because when the fig tree buds, it's spring.
[time=3082] And when the full leaves come out, now you know it's summer.
[time=3086] Jesus said, how will you know when the end comes when these signs begin to develop?
[time=3092] And now he says, here's the first sign.
[time=3096] Look at verse 36, no one knows about that day or hour when in the spring of these events is taking place, not the angels in heaven nor the sun, but only the Father.
[time=3109] As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
[time=3113] For in the days of Noah, before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage up to the day that Noah entered the ark and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away.
[time=3129] This is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
[time=3133] One will be taken and the other left.
[time=3138] Two women will be grinding with a hand mill, one will be taken, the other left.
[time=3143] Therefore, keep watch because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
[time=3150] This passage, we called the rapture of the church.
[time=3157] I like to use the word rescue of the church.
[time=3160] Jesus had just told him about the tribulation.
[time=3162] He says, you won't know when it's coming, but I want you to know I'm gonna rescue you.
[time=3167] Let me talk a little bit about this rescue of the church, give you three characteristics that I see here.
[time=3174] The first characteristic is this is a certainty unknown.
[time=3177] It's certain because Christ said, I will come again.
[time=3183] He promised his disciples that over and over again, but he says it's a certainty.
[time=3188] We don't know when it's gonna happen.
[time=3190] He says, no one knows the day, no one knows the hour.
[time=3193] It's an uncertain time.
[time=3198] Second thing he says in verse 37 is it's a complete surprise.
[time=3203] You see, I believe today is a day perfect for the Lord Jesus Christ to come again.
[time=3211] Everything is lined up perfect because there are no signs that have to be lined up except for one and that is it's unexpected.
[time=3219] How many of us I wonder this morning, God happens to this is a great day.
[time=3224] I wonder if Jesus Christ will come today.
[time=3228] I bet none of you did.
[time=3229] I did because I knew I was gonna ask the question, but I didn't last Sunday.
[time=3233] You see, Christ said the only sign of his rapture will be,
[time=3239] it's unexpected.
[time=3241] That's why this could be that very day.
[time=3246] He describes it as a complete surprise and he gives two facts.
[time=3250] First is it's like Noah.
[time=3252] How is the rapture of the church like Noah?
[time=3255] Three ways.
[time=3257] First of all, Noah's days, the people were immersed in living.
[time=3260] It says Noah's out there building an ark and they're drinking and eating, they're having weddings, they're making wedding arrangements.
[time=3266] Life goes on.
[time=3268] They're preoccupied with life.
[time=3271] Just like our society is preoccupied with life and ignores God's message.
[time=3276] Secondly, it's like the days of Noah because people ignore the warning.
[time=3282] Although you may tell them or I may tell them that God has a plan for the ages and we must be prepared for it now, people ignored Noah and they ignored us.
[time=3292] You see, Noah was out there building an ark about the size of a football field.
[time=3297] That's not an easy thing to keep a secret.
[time=3300] Bill Cosby did a humorous sketch 15 or 20 years ago about Noah building the ark.
[time=3307] Noah's out there building this ark and everybody walks by, it's never rained in history.
[time=3311] They said, "No, what are you doing?" They said, "I'm building an ark, an ark, what's an ark?" Well, it's this big boat and it's gonna rain, rain, what's rain?
[time=3320] Well, the sky's gonna form clouds and water's gonna come down, it's gonna flood the earth.
[time=3324] And they said, "Right, it's gonna rain." And Cosby puts it this way and Noah said, "And the rain's gonna come down, "all the sewers are gonna back up." And they said, "Right, the sewers are gonna back up." They ignored this man's warning.
[time=3341] Just like today, you and I say to somebody, "Jesus Christ is coming in." They go, "Right, Jesus is coming again.
[time=3347] "You let me know when he comes." People then and people now ignored the warning.
[time=3355] And thirdly, we're in an age like Noah's age because people are ignorant of the consequences.
[time=3362] They said, "Ah, no floods coming." And even the water comes with no big deal.
[time=3366] They didn't realize that a flood was going to come and wipe away their entire world.
[time=3371] And when Jesus comes, the tribulation comes and it wipes away the world as you and I know it.
[time=3376] It's a complete surprise like Noah and it's a complete surprise like a disappearance from planet earth.
[time=3387] Jesus said, "It's gonna be like two people "are walking along and I'm gonna come "and one of them is gonna be taken away, raptured, "and the other one's gonna say, 'Where'd he go?'" It's like two women working at the same table, working on flour, they're gonna bake some bread and she looks away to get some more flour, she looks back, her friend's gone.
[time=3405] It'll be a complete surprise.
[time=3408] It's been postulated that perhaps the reason why there are so many reportings of UFOs is because Satan is preparing the world for the rapture.
[time=3420] He's preparing the world by having his demons appear as UFOs, then when the rapture occurs, the whole world will say, "What happened to all those people?" And some smart scientists will stand up and say, "Ufos, last night came and took half the world's population "and the half of this stuff will say, 'You're right.'" I don't know that that's what this is, the UFO phenomena, but it's an interesting theory.
[time=3447] It'll be a complete surprise because some will be taken and some will not.
[time=3453] Thirdly, the rescue of the church, a certain year known, a complete surprise, is primarily a call to vigilance.
[time=3462] Verse 42, "Therefore, watch, be ready." You don't know the hour your Lord comes.
[time=3468] The implication is this, if you don't know Christ today, get to know him.
[time=3472] Receive him as your savior.
[time=3475] If you do know Christ, make today count for him.
[time=3478] It could be the last opportunity we have.
[time=3481] Someone has put this to pen under the musical title.
[time=3486] I wish we had all been ready.
[time=3488] Allow me to quote part of it for you.
[time=3491] Two men walking up a hill, one is gone, one is left, standing still.
[time=3498] I wish we had all been ready.
[time=3500] A man and wife asleep in bed, he hears a noise and turns his head.
[time=3506] She's gone.
[time=3508] I wish we had all been ready.
[time=3516] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our sanctuary choir, the Men's Sangers Quartet, and soloist Lynn Roll.
[time=3523] Our message today was a timely message concerning the second coming from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3528] If you've made a decision today concerning your spiritual walk with God, just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer.
[time=3535] Will you bow your heads and pray this prayer with me?
[time=3537] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross.
[time=3545] As I see the world and I view the need for Christ to come into my heart, I ask you to come in today and to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me.
[time=3555] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed that prayer this morning, would you write us and tell us the decision that you made?
