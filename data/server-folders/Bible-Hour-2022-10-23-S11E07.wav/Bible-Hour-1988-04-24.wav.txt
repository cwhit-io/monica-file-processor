[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=113] As we study the Bible today, we will examine this forgotten truth.
[time=119] It's found here in the New Testament.
[time=122] It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[time=128] [MUSIC]
[time=139] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=141] Thank you for joining us.
[time=142] Rick's message today is taken from the Book of Matthew when it is entitled His Wrath.
[time=147] This forgotten truth will be our study today.
[time=150] Yes, God is a God of love, but this must be balanced with the spiritual truth that He is also a just God who will punish sin.
[time=159] The Bible calls this just anger wrath.
[time=162] We are wise to heed the warning, flee the wrath of God.
[time=166] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=169] Rick's text is the Book of Matthew, chapter 24, who we'll be looking at verses 15 through 21.
[time=177] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=181] Other special music includes a song from celebration and sutoy rec.
[time=189] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=197] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=202] Now, here's Rick.
[time=204] Good morning and welcome.
[time=206] It's a joy to have you here this morning.
[time=209] And we hope that you sense that this place is a place where the Lord is present.
[time=215] The Lord Jesus said that were two or three were gathered in His name that He would be there in the midst of them.
[time=223] That makes this place holy because Jesus is here.
[time=227] Thank you for worshiping with us.
[time=229] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=235] As we meet on Sunday mornings, we meet to worship God and to praise Him.
[time=240] God is worthy of praise for more ways than we could mention.
[time=244] But one way that we are always to thank God for His greatness is because of His faithfulness.
[time=251] And our choir sings in a beautiful way, a traditional hymn, "Great is Thy faithfulness." Oh, God, our Father.
[time=260] [MUSIC - 222 seconds]
[time=491] - How faithful the Lord is.
[time=506] Faith is the victory that overcomes the world.
[time=508] In spite of the problems, we can be confident that Christ is here, and He will at His own time overcome the world.
[time=516] Faith is the victory, Him number 418.
[time=519] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stands us together.
[time=522] Let's sing with confidence that we know who the victor is, the Lord Jesus Christ, Him number 418.
[time=536] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=676] Thank you for your confidence singing today.
[time=678] We appreciate that.
[time=680] Let's turn our hearts now to listening to music.
[time=682] A celebration comes to sing for us.
[time=684] The song in the spirit of David.
[time=696] [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of praise [MUSIC] Longing to stand in God's presence [MUSIC] Rejoicing in the Lord always [MUSIC] Lifting our hands in the temple [MUSIC] The better of worship we reigns [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of praise [MUSIC] Just like the little boy David [MUSIC] Boldly we show forth his praise [MUSIC] Taking the sword of the spirit [MUSIC] And slay the giant that stands in our way [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of praise [MUSIC] Longing to stand in God's presence [MUSIC] Rejoicing in the Lord always [MUSIC] Lifting our hands in the temple [MUSIC] The better of worship we reigns [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of praise [MUSIC] Take up your heart from the willow [MUSIC] Let your praise begin today [MUSIC] It's time for silence to be broken [MUSIC] Arise and put on your garments of praise [MUSIC] We are a people after God somehow [MUSIC] You've knighted together [MUSIC] From near and apart [MUSIC] Marching together we're being restored [MUSIC] Shining our voices in one accord [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of praise [MUSIC] Longing to stand in God's presence [MUSIC] Rejoicing in the Lord always [MUSIC] Lifting our hands in the temple [MUSIC] The better of worship we reigns [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of praise [MUSIC] Lifting our hands in the temple [MUSIC] The better of worship we reigns [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of David [MUSIC] We have the spirit of praise [MUSIC] Christ, I heard and weary [MUSIC] Lost and scattered everywhere [MUSIC] To the master they were just like [MUSIC] Just like sheep without a shepherd's care [MUSIC] He felled of their infirmities [MUSIC] So much that it made him weep [MUSIC] His heart was filled with pity and compassion for his sheep [MUSIC] This world is so tired and weary [MUSIC] As they wander aimlessly [MUSIC] Like sheep without a shepherd's care [MUSIC] There is lost as lost can be [MUSIC] Consume me now with a love for the lost [MUSIC] Let that love become a light [MUSIC] That guides lost sheep into the hills [MUSIC] Before there comes the light [MUSIC] Lord, please move me with compassion for the lost by praise [MUSIC] Oh, the millions who are lost [MUSIC] And cannot find their way [MUSIC] Gelt my careless heart with love no matter what the cost [MUSIC] Lord, please move me with compassion for the Lord [MUSIC] Lord, please move me with compassion for the lost I pray [MUSIC] For the millions who are lost [MUSIC] And cannot find their way [MUSIC] Gelt my careless heart with love no matter what the cost [MUSIC] Lord, please move me with compassion for the lost [MUSIC] Lord, please move me with compassion for the lost [MUSIC] Lord, please move me with compassion for the lost â™ª
[time=1518] Thank you, Susan.
[time=1520] Let's honor the Lord by reciting His word now as we stand and recite the verse for this week.
[time=1526] If you're visiting with us, we have that verse printed for your easy reference on the top on the inside of your bowl.
[time=1534] First Corinthians 1551, listen, I tell you a mystery, we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed.
[time=1546] First Corinthians 1551. Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1554] Thank you, Dale. I hope you make that your habit of memorizing God's word with us each week.
[time=1562] I never saw this, but I'm told that that memory verse was written out in full and placed over a church nursery.
[time=1570] We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.
[time=1578] One announcement that I omitted earlier is we do have a cassette tape of our choir and musicians of the Easter music they shared with us on Easter evening a few weeks ago.
[time=1588] It has three songs by the choir, celebration, Kevin Rowe.
[time=1594] It has the bell choir, Scott Schindler on the keyboards, and Marilyn Wong, I believe.
[time=1598] And if you'd like to purchase those, they are available here at the church today.
[time=1602] Forgive me for bringing announcement up at this time, but we want you to know of that opportunity to listen in your home and car as well.
[time=1612] Would you bow with me that we might pray together?
[time=1616] My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine, and for thee all of the fallies of sin I resign.
[time=1632] My gracious Redeemer, my Savior, art thou, if ever I love thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
[time=1644] Oh Lord, we do love you today.
[time=1648] We've assembled in this place because we think that you are worthy of the first morning of our week.
[time=1658] That the first song that our lips sing should be a praise to your name.
[time=1662] To the first instruction that we take should be out of your word.
[time=1668] To the first commitments we make ought to be to your will.
[time=1674] And so we so come to resign ourself to you on this first day of a new week.
[time=1682] We ask you to meet with us in spirit and in truth.
[time=1686] And we ask you to be the one to teach us as no man can teach us, but your spirit, please Lord, teach our spirit.
[time=1696] We pray that you would comfort and encourage those who have walked through difficult times.
[time=1702] We think of those who have either lost their job or perhaps will have to leave the community that they call home because of a job change.
[time=1712] You'll give them great security in you.
[time=1716] We pray for those who have this week gone through the fracturing of a family.
[time=1722] You'll bring healing to their hearts.
[time=1726] We rejoice with those today who rejoice.
[time=1730] Thank you for the gift of a baby born to the Souders, for a marriage in our chapel, for the anticipation of love committed this next weekend.
[time=1740] We mourn with those who mourn.
[time=1744] So we pray today that you would comfort Brian Lowson and the tragic death of his uncle on US 30.
[time=1752] We pray today that you would comfort those who have walked through that same valley of death in recent days.
[time=1760] Again, Lord, we've come to tell you that we love you and we want to serve you.
[time=1768] In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
[time=1778] My first real paying job was as a lifeguard.
[time=1784] We had these chairs that were about eight foot above the pool deck and we sat there hour by hour,
[time=1790] boringly watching everybody else enjoying the cool water as we got baked by the sun.
[time=1796] On a rare occasion, it was necessary to jump in and to help someone out.
[time=1800] Probably the most memorial, memorable time in my lifeguard and career was that first summer.
[time=1808] As I sprung into action, diving off my chair, leaping into the water, stroking head above like Johnny Weismiller, rescuing this individual.
[time=1818] I grabbed him by the arm, pulled it across him, put him on a hip carry, and he looked at me and he said, "What are you doing?"
[time=1826] And I said, "I'm saving you." And he said, "Thanks a lot, but I'm not drowning."
[time=1834] It was a little bit embarrassing.
[time=1838] Have you ever had that experience?
[time=1840] You've tried to tell somebody that Jesus Christ died for their sins and that he can save them and they said, "I'm not drowning.
[time=1852] I don't need saved. I don't need Jesus. I don't need God's love. What are you doing to me, man?
[time=1862] What's wrong with you?" You see, tragically, we Christians have carried only half of God's message to our world.
[time=1876] We have said to them, "This half. God loves you, and that's a good half to carry."
[time=1884] You know, there's a second half.
[time=1886] God hates sin, and he will punish sin and sinners alike.
[time=1894] When we speak of God's character and that he is just and he will punish sin, the biblical word for God's executing of his divine justice is called God's wrath.
[time=1908] That's a word we don't use too often, particularly as we talk about God.
[time=1914] Society has shaped the church's image of God rather than the church shaping society's image of God,
[time=1922] and today to speak about God's wrath, how many is repugnant?
[time=1926] Does some is downright ungodly to call God wrathful?
[time=1932] There would be those today that if they could have this microphone, they would object to someone standing and saying that God has wrath and that he will execute it.
[time=1946] Why is it that some would object to God's wrath?
[time=1948] Well, some object because they say, "I don't believe God's like that. I don't believe God will punish sin."
[time=1956] And I need to ask the question, why is it that you believe that God is totally passive?
[time=1964] And why is it that you believe that God will not punish sin?
[time=1968] And the answer is always, "Well, I just feel that way."
[time=1974] But you see, neither you nor I have the right to define God.
[time=1980] God alone has the right to give a self-definition, and in his word he said that he is loving,
[time=1988] but the pendulum skill must be balanced that he is also an angry God who will demonstrate his anger towards sin.
[time=1998] You see, idolatry is the habit of saying, "I'll define God."
[time=2006] Others object to speaking of God's wrath because they say, "Well, I know that the Old Testament says that, but I believe in the New Testament."
[time=2016] Well, I think we have to believe in the Old Testament and the New Testament, and there's a partial truth.
[time=2020] You're right. The Old Testament has far more weight in its teaching about God's wrath, but the New Testament does not omit it.
[time=2032] Next week, we'll ask you to memorize as your memory verse. Hebrews 1031, which says, "It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
[time=2042] That's New Testament. Hebrews 1229 says, "Our God is a consuming fire."
[time=2052] That's just not Old Testament stuff.
[time=2056] Others object to teaching about God's wrath because they say, "That's not right. You're just trying to scare people."
[time=2064] Beloved, we're not trying to scare anyone. If I wanted to scare you today, I'd sing, but I'll preach.
[time=2072] We're not trying to scare anyone out of hell.
[time=2078] We're simply trying to warn people of what the Scriptures teach.
[time=2082] You'll remember in the news, it may have been as many as ten years ago, in a dense fog.
[time=2090] A fog so thick on the Tampa Bay that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.
[time=2096] A pilot misguided his ship, struck the suspension bridge, and severed the bridge.
[time=2102] In that fog, one car after another drove through the fog right to their death off the end of the Tampa Bay bridge.
[time=2114] When somebody finally figured out what was happening and moved back up the bridge and began flagging cars down yelling,
[time=2122] "Stop! You'll pummel down to your death." Not one person said, "You shouldn't do that. You might scare those people."
[time=2132] Why one of you yelled, "Stop! You're about to die and you gave some poor driver a heart attack. Then how would you feel?"
[time=2140] I mean, can you sense the absurdity of not warning people of eminent death?
[time=2146] The Bible says that God loves us and that his solution to our eminent death at his wrathful hands is to receive his son as Savior.
[time=2162] And so we must carry a balanced message to the world. God loves you. He loves you so much that he sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross for your sins.
[time=2176] And Jesus will take God's wrath away if you will receive him. But God is just and he will punish sin.
[time=2186] If you have your Bible today, I invite you to open it to Matthew 24. This as much as anything else gives us insight into God's wrath.
[time=2200] I believe it's fair for us to say that God occasionally demonstrates his wrath today.
[time=2208] But in a global way, God is withholding his wrath like the powerful waters being held back by a dam.
[time=2218] God's wrath is being temporarily held back by a dam called grace.
[time=2226] But God says there's going to come a day when he's going to open up the dam of his grace and his wrath will burst through.
[time=2234] We call that period of time still future the great tribulation.
[time=2240] In Matthew 24, Jesus disciples in verses 1 through 4 raised some questions about when Jesus is going to bring his kingdom.
[time=2250] In verses 4 through 14, Jesus talks about pre-tribulation events.
[time=2256] Throughout that, he said, but the end is not come. These are just the beginning of birth and then in verse 14, he says, and then the end will come.
[time=2266] So everything from verse 14 prior is pre-tribulation.
[time=2272] Verse 15 through verse 31 is a description of the tribulation itself.
[time=2278] And then as we studied last week, verses 32 through 35, Jesus stops his chronology and he says, now let me give you a parable.
[time=2288] And he tells them a parable about the fig tree and he says, when the fig tree buds, you know it's spring, it's the start of a new season.
[time=2298] And Jesus says, now here's how you'll know the start of the end time.
[time=2302] Two men will be walking, one will be taking one left. Two women making grain, one will disappear, the other one will be there.
[time=2310] We call it the rapture of the church.
[time=2314] But we are going to study today, verses 15 through 31, the tribulation, the time of God's wrath.
[time=2324] Before we break that down, let me give you seven different names for the great tribulation because I think if you just hear the names, you'll understand what this tribulation period is all about.
[time=2338] Probably the simplest name for this period is called the day of the Lord. Here's what Isaiah said in Isaiah 13, 6.
[time=2346] See, the day of the Lord is coming. Now the word day of the Lord may sound a bit benign, but picture it in this sense.
[time=2358] God says, I know that today people are ignoring me.
[time=2368] I know that today people are defying me and spitting defiantly in my face, but they'll come my day.
[time=2380] That's the implication of the phrase day of the Lord. It's the day when God says, I'm going to balance the scales.
[time=2388] A second description is this, the great day of the Lord.
[time=2394] Zephaniah 114 says, the great day of the Lord is near and coming quickly.
[time=2402] So this isn't just going to be a day, it's going to be a significant day.
[time=2408] The third description tells us, Joel 2 verse 21 reads like this, the sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord.
[time=2424] A great and terrible day.
[time=2428] A fourth name is that it's a day of the Lord's wrath or a day of vengeance.
[time=2434] Isaiah 61 was quoted by Jesus. Here's how it reads.
[time=2440] The spirit of the Lord is on me because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
[time=2448] He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom to the captives, and to release the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.
[time=2458] And Jesus stopped reading.
[time=2462] But notice the next phrase, and to proclaim the day of the vengeance of our God.
[time=2468] Now the reason why Jesus stopped is because when He first came, He only came to do that first list, to proclaim freedom to the captives, to bind the brokenhearted, and to proclaim a year of favor, a year of grace.
[time=2484] It doesn't mean 365 days, it's euphemistically meaning a long season of grace.
[time=2492] And when Jesus comes back a second time, He'll finish that quote, and He'll proclaim a day of vengeance of our God.
[time=2502] And not a 24 hour day, but a short era of God's wrath.
[time=2506] A fifth name is almost ironic. It's found in Revelation 6, 16 and 17, where it says that this period of time is called the wrath of the Lamb.
[time=2522] That's almost comical. The picture of this white little furry lamb being wrathful.
[time=2532] We think of the wrath of the rhinoceros, or the power of the lion, but we don't think of this little lamb saying, "I'm going to get you."
[time=2542] But this is not a little lamb. This is God who said, "I became a lamb to die for sin, and someday you'll see me in my wrath."
[time=2552] A sixth title is one that's a little harder to understand, it's called Daniel's 70th week.
[time=2560] In the book of Daniel chapter 9 verses 25 through 27, Daniel has a prophetic vision in the future. He sees 69 weeks, not that they're weeks as you and I know Monday through Saturday, but periods of 7.
[time=2576] And then he saw a 70th week, and we take that to be 7 years, and that lines up with the numbers of Revelation, and this is called Daniel's 70th week.
[time=2592] A seventh name, the one we use most often is found here in Matthew 24 verse 21 in the King James Bible. It says, "A time of great tribulation. Great tribulation is also found in Revelation 7, 13, and 14."
[time=2610] But you see by those names, they really describe the situation for us. It is a time of wrath, of vengeance, of tribulation.
[time=2622] Well, in Matthew 24, Jesus gives us 7 characteristics of this era. We had 7 names, now we got 7 characteristics. Before we're done today, I'm going to give you 6 sets of 7 for 42.
[time=2638] You can do that in less than 42 minutes. So if you're a note taker, you'll be a frustrated note taker today, and I apologize. Out of Matthew 24, here is the first of the 7 descriptions of the tribulation that Jesus gives, verse 15.
[time=2654] So when you see, standing in the holy place, the abomination that causes desolation, spoken up through the prophet Daniel, let the reader understand.
[time=2666] The first description is Daniel's anti-Christ will rise. In Daniel, Daniel saw the arrival of a world leader who would be antithetical and substitutionary of God, who would rule over the world.
[time=2688] The New Testament gives to that man the title Antichrist. There have been individuals who in many ways have been precursors of the Antichrist.
[time=2702] There is a spirit of Antichrist that John says is already in the world, but the Bible says there is a future world leader who is the Antichrist.
[time=2714] And there are 7 descriptions of him in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. I'll give them to you in rapid fire. First of all, he is a man of great charisma.
[time=2724] He will have or atorical skills and a magnetic personality that will absolutely captivate the world.
[time=2734] In many ways, Adolf Hitler was a precursor of the Antichrist because he was one who could speak with such conviction and eloquence in persuasiveness that he deceived not only a nation, but a continent.
[time=2750] But the Antichrist tongue will be more golden than even that of Hitler. Secondly, the Antichrist will be a man of lawlessness.
[time=2762] The Bible says in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, both in verse 3 and 8, that he is the man of lawlessness. It's almost a title for him.
[time=2772] Thirdly, he will be a man who is an imitator of God. Here's what it said in verse 4 of 2 Thessalonians 2.
[time=2784] He opposes and exalts himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped and even sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
[time=2796] That is the abomination of desolation predicted by Daniel, re-predicted by Christ. It is Antichrist in God's temple saying, "I am God, worship me."
[time=2812] There is a fourth characteristic of this individual. You may be saying, "Why would anybody believe him?"
[time=2820] Because he will be gifted with supernatural power. 2 Thessalonians 2.9.
[time=2828] The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders.
[time=2838] You see, Satan has supernatural power. He is going to give it in a great way to the Antichrist.
[time=2846] But before we pursue that, please know that Satan has power today and he uses it.
[time=2854] So just because somebody has great power doesn't mean that it's from God.
[time=2860] The Antichrist will duplicate Christ. The word anti does not primarily mean against as much as it means instead of.
[time=2872] And the Antichrist props himself up instead of Christ.
[time=2878] And he will probably purposely choose to reduplicate many of the miracles of Christ. And that's why people will follow him because he will be supernaturally gifted.
[time=2892] A fifth thing about the Antichrist is he will be exceedingly evil. You would think that one who was lawless and one who is empowered by Satan would be evil, he will be evil personified.
[time=2906] A sixth description of him is that he is a deceiver. He will use his tongue and he will use his power to deceive the world.
[time=2920] But finally, he is also described as one doomed for destruction. The 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 3, as soon as Paul mentions it, he says, don't let anyone deceive you in any way.
[time=2936] For that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed for destruction.
[time=2946] Now the first of the 7 descriptions that Jesus gives of the tribulation is this one. Daniel's Antichrist will rise.
[time=2958] A second description is found in verses 16 through 23.
[time=2964] Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house.
[time=2972] Let no one in the field go back to get as close how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers.
[time=2980] Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.
[time=2986] For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now and never to be equaled again.
[time=2994] If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.
[time=3002] At that time, if anyone says to you, look, here is the Christ or there he is, do not believe it.
[time=3010] The second description is this, it is distressing days.
[time=3018] For my own sake, I've divided it as this, days of panic and days of peril.
[time=3024] Days of panic, it says if you're on the roof, don't come down.
[time=3028] Don't re-enter the house, try to pack a few things, jump off the roof and get out of there.
[time=3034] If you're in the field and your cloaks at the other end of the field, run, get out of there.
[time=3040] Perhaps one way to understand this sense of panic is one of the great events of the tribulation will be the Battle of Armageddon,
[time=3050] which will be in a fertile field throughout the land of Palestine.
[time=3056] And maybe what Jesus is saying is if you're in the midst of that battle, you'll want to get out of there before it ever starts.
[time=3064] Distressing days.
[time=3066] Notice verse 21, it says these days will be unequaled in history past or history future.
[time=3076] Perhaps the only way we can understand that is for me to give you three more lists of seven.
[time=3082] In the book of Revelation, we are told about the distressing events of those days.
[time=3088] John gives it to us in sevens.
[time=3092] The first seven is like a scroll. If you can picture a scroll that's all rolled up
[time=3098] and when you want to hold that scroll together, you put it like a wax seal on it and it's sealed.
[time=3102] Well, John's got a scroll that's sealed and then another scroll is wrapped around the outside of it and it's sealed
[time=3108] and then a third and it's sealed and a fourth and it's sealed until you've got seven sealed scrolls.
[time=3114] And the scroll represents the pronouncement of judgment that God's unrolling the judgment.
[time=3120] So the first seal is broken and there'll be seven and here are the seven seal judgments.
[time=3126] The first one is the white horse who represents antichrist.
[time=3132] The second one is a red horse who represents war.
[time=3136] The third one is a black horse who represents famine.
[time=3140] The fourth horse is a pale horse who represents death.
[time=3146] And you have the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[time=3150] The fifth seal is broken and it represents and tells us that believers will be martyred.
[time=3156] The sixth seal, cosmic chaos, and just when you finally get to the last seal and you think it's been terrible,
[time=3166] but there's only one more, you open the seventh seal and you unroll it and the seventh judgment is seven more judgments.
[time=3176] These are called the trumpet judgments because an angel comes and announces them by blowing the trumpet and the judgments come.
[time=3186] So there are seven more.
[time=3188] The first trumpet judgment, hail and fire and one third of the earth is burned.
[time=3194] The second trumpet judgment, one third of the sea turns the blood.
[time=3202] The third trumpet judgment, one third of the fresh water turns bitter.
[time=3208] The fourth trumpet judgment, one third of the light is taken away.
[time=3214] The fifth trumpet judgment, demons attack, but not believers.
[time=3220] The sixth trumpet judgment, a 200 million man army crosses the dried Euphrates and prepares for war
[time=3230] and one third of mankind is killed.
[time=3234] Now finally, the seventh trumpet judgment.
[time=3238] Not only is there the blowing of a trumpet, there is earthquake and natural disaster to get attention
[time=3246] for the seventh and final judgment and the seventh trumpet judgment is seven more judgments.
[time=3256] These are called the bowl judgments because it's like there is a bowl and it is filled with God's wrath and he's about to pour it out.
[time=3266] The first bowl judgment is painful sores on those who receive the mark of the Antichrist.
[time=3274] The second bowl is the rest of the sea that was not polluted is now polluted.
[time=3280] The third bowl, the rest of the fresh water that was not polluted, it is now polluted.
[time=3288] The fourth bowl, the sun scorches the earth that is already void of water.
[time=3294] The fifth bowl, darkness covers the kingdom of the beast.
[time=3300] The sixth bowl Armageddon is launched and the seventh bowl is the finale of everything exploding.
[time=3312] You see why Jesus said these are distressing days such as there never have been nor never will be again.
[time=3326] I talk to Matthew 24, the third description that Jesus gives is the deception of false Christ.
[time=3338] He says if someone in a very public way says, "Hey, I found the Messiah, he's out here in the wilderness, he needed a big open area, everybody come on, don't believe it."
[time=3350] But if somebody comes up to you in a private way and says, "That guy's a phony, I found the real Messiah, we've got him tucked away in a little inner room.
[time=3360] I'm not telling everybody, just a few people come and see Jesus said, don't believe them."
[time=3370] Now many will believe because Satan will give supernatural power and the spirit of deception.
[time=3380] But their signs of miracles are mistaken signs.
[time=3386] There is an unmistaken sign when Jesus comes.
[time=3394] We'll look at it in a moment.
[time=3396] The fourth description is the devastation of nature, verse 29.
[time=3400] Immediately after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and heavenly bodies will be shaken.
[time=3412] I like to look at verse 29 and give it this title.
[time=3416] Chicken Little will be exonerated.
[time=3420] That little chicken you read about was your child or your mom and dad read to you.
[time=3426] The sky is falling, the sky is falling.
[time=3428] If you're not a believer, and suddenly you wake up and all of us who you knew were believers are gone, and this chicken comes running by and says the sky is falling, believe that chicken.
[time=3442] Because the Bible says the stars of the heavens are going to fall.
[time=3448] And the implication and the teaching of revelation is guess where they're going to fall on the earth.
[time=3456] Nature will destroy itself.
[time=3460] The fifth sign, the descent of Christ.
[time=3464] Verse 30, "At that time the sign of the sun of man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn."
[time=3472] They will see the sun of man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
[time=3478] If you're here because you're not a believer and you didn't get taken out with us, and you keep hearing that this one is Christ and that one is Christ, the one you should believe is the one who comes out of heaven on clouds.
[time=3494] Riding on a white horse with thousands and thousands of his angels behind him, that's the one, an unmistakable sign.
[time=3504] The sixth sign is this.
[time=3516] I'm glad that you joined us today for the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, celebration, and soloist Sue Toyrac, and then the message from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3526] Today's message not only spoke of the grace of God, but certainly the judgment of God.
[time=3532] If you'd like to be free from that judgment and the wrath to come, you can accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3538] If you've never done that, would you bow your head and pray this prayer with me?
[time=3542] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ upon this earth to die and to forgive me of my sins.
[time=3550] I ask you to come into my heart today and cleanse me and make me free of the sins that I've committed so that I can enjoy eternal life with you.
[time=3560] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3564] If you prayed that prayer this morning, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
