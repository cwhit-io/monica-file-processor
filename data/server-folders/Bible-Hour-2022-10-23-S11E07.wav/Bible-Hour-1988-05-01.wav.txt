[time=30] , worship a living.
[time=60] (bells ringing)
[time=90] I believe the greatest song ever written
[time=111] is the Hallelujah Course, the climax of Handel's Messiah.
[time=116] It speaks about the kingdom of our God, actually here on earth, a time when there's no death, no dying, no war, no disease.
[time=125] And in Revelation 21, it tells us how we can have a part in the kingdom of Christ.
[time=133] (music playing)
[time=143] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=148] Thank you for joining us.
[time=150] Rick's message today is taken from the book of Revelation and is entitled His Rain.
[time=154] Jesus said that we should pray thy kingdom come.
[time=158] But what kingdom is this?
[time=160] What is it coming?
[time=161] What will it be like?
[time=163] Well, I get to be part of it.
[time=165] Today is our final study on the life of Christ as we see the Lord reigning over all.
[time=170] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Revelation 20.
[time=174] We'll be looking at verses one through six.
[time=177] Our special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir at Richard, Rejoice, and Marilyn Wong.
[time=190] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort White, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=198] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=202] Now here's Rick.
[time=204] God, we're delighted that you've come that we can lift up our voices together and worship the Lord and say, "Marinatha, He is coming again.
[time=214] Alleluia, praise Him." I hope that within your own heart there's that purpose today that you have come to worship the Lord.
[time=222] We're delighted that you're here and want to take this moment to formally welcome you and to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=232] The theme of much of our music and our message today is the fact that Jesus is coming again.
[time=239] We'll join together in the ministry of three songs.
[time=245] It'll take a little bit of time to remind you of the verses and the songs, but we're going to begin with 471.
[time=252] And you just put your thumb in that and then turn to Him number 673.
[time=257] This is participation Sunday.
[time=259] We'll join in in these songs depicting the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=265] And then finally, Him number 396.
[time=269] Now that's not too difficult because it's in your bulletin, but you will be singing verses 1 and 3 on the first song, verses 1, 3 and 4 on the second one, and verses 1 and 2 on the third one.
[time=285] There are interludes between each song and there are some time to find it.
[time=289] And listen to the choir, we'll join together.
[time=291] They know the verses ahead of time.
[time=293] And let's join in in singing this medley of songs with a great anticipation that indeed it's going to be a glad day when Jesus returns.
[time=301] Him number 471.
