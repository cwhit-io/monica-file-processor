[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] Welcome to an hour of Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=125] Thank you for joining us.
[time=127] While Pastor Rick is vacationing, our guest speaker will be Dr. Ken Nichols of the Alive Counseling Ministries in El Cajon, California.
[time=134] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us as Dr. Nichols shares with us from God's Word.
[time=141] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=144] Other special music includes an instrumental duet from Dave and Debbie Johnson, and a solo from Kevin Rowe.
[time=154] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=162] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=167] Now, here's Pete.
[time=169] You will join in in praising the name of Jesus.
[time=172] We welcome you to our sanctuary today and to our worship hour.
[time=175] We also welcome those that are watching us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=181] We're glad that we've all joined together to worship the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=185] Our pastor, Rick Hawks, is on vacation this week.
[time=188] He's vacationing in Florida, a well-deserved rest.
[time=192] Pray for him while he's gone, that he'll have a good time of relaxation.
[time=196] We'll play a good round of golf occasionally, and we'll come back excited about the ministry of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=203] We miss him, but we're glad that he has the opportunity to rest this week.
[time=207] The choir will be singing now a song taken from Isaiah the 40th chapter.
[time=211] Every mountain and every hill will be made low.
[time=214] God's name will be honored and glorified.
[time=217] (gentle music)
[time=224] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=378] - We come to worship and honor the name of the Lord.
[time=389] We're especially thankful for those mothers that are worshiping with us today.
[time=392] We're grateful that you're here.
[time=394] We're also grateful that we're all you've done for your children throughout the years.
[time=398] Music can be a great ministry, even as instrumentalists come to minister to us in song, we can think of the words that are a part of this medley that Dave and Debbie Johnson are going to play for us.
[time=410] Trust and obey for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
[time=418] (gentle music)
[time=521] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=549] (gentle music)
[time=579] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=605] (gentle music)
[time=635] (gentle music) - We're really glad that you joined us
[time=650] for the Bible Hour today.
[time=651] This is the point in our service that we break away from our congregation and tell you about some of the events that are taking place in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=660] Our pastor Rick Hawks is on vacation this week.
[time=663] He and his family are vacationing in Florida.
[time=665] They have taken a well-deserved rest.
[time=668] We expect them back next week, but we're glad that they could get away for just a little while and recuperate and be anxious then to come back to the ministry of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=677] Our guest today is Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=680] Dr. Nichols is a former staff member here at Black Hawk.
[time=683] He was here five years ago and began the counseling ministry called the Alive Counseling Center.
[time=689] He has done much in the area of encouraging people in their troubled lives and he now lives in Oklahoma, California.
[time=695] But we're certainly glad that he's here and you'll be hearing from him in just a few moments.
[time=700] Our worship center is continuing to develop on the other side of the street.
[time=705] We will be planning to be in that building sometime in September.
[time=708] And for those of you that don't have an opportunity to see the building, I'd like to take a moment and tell you a little bit about it by way of some video.
[time=716] They're working on the ceiling right now.
[time=718] It's a very unusual construction of some V-shaped dry wall.
[time=724] And this is the sprinkling system being put in so that the entire building is protected.
[time=728] Down below the balcony, they're preparing the groundwork for laying of concrete.
[time=734] This is a shot again from the bottom, looking up at the ceiling that's being prepared and along the ceiling are the ducts for the heating and air conditioning.
[time=743] This is a little mezzanine level, overlooking the balcony.
[time=748] Outside, we've already done some work on our parking lot, but on the east side of the building, we are preparing more blacktop for those that come to worship with us.
[time=759] Again, we're back on the ceiling, a dry wall it, and then tape it and it won't be long.
[time=764] In just a couple more weeks, they will be taking down all the scaffolding and will have completed our entire ceiling.
[time=770] That is a very difficult construction.
[time=775] This is the south side of our building, looking behind our new building with some anticipation of some additional parking space.
[time=783] Looking directly back is our new baseball diamond, and then to the left, as you view the picture, is our new soccer field for our Christian high school.
[time=791] They'll be playing for the first time this fall.
[time=793] This is looking from the building, looking north through Laymeyer Street, and Cross Street is state.
[time=800] This is again, preparation of our new parking facility in this area so that we can accommodate those that come to worship with us.
[time=808] This is our present structure, as you see it from, looking from our new building.
[time=813] Every time you go by, or we show pictures, you see a large green plastic area.
[time=818] That's an area where there'll be a large stained glass window of an open Bible, and you're looking now south at the building as you come south on Laymeyer.
[time=827] It's a very exciting thing to watch it on a daily basis, and I can hardly keep myself from going over every day just to see the progress that's being made.
[time=837] I hope that you can come by if you're in our area and stop and at least go by and see this beautiful structure that God is giving us.
[time=844] For a couple of Sundays now, we've been advertising a booklet that has really been an encouragement to me.
[time=850] I read it this week and it talks about pain, the essentialness of pain, and also it's inevitable.
[time=856] It's going to come in the Christian's life.
[time=858] And if you've heard somebody talk about pain and you realize that God takes away all pain, that just isn't true.
[time=864] God does allow pain to come in our lives for no apparent reason except just to strengthen us.
[time=869] And we have a book that's entitled When Your Comfort Zone Get Squeezed by Chuck Swindall.
[time=875] This is a great book and I encourage you to write for it today.
[time=879] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=889] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=897] A tremendous booklet that I encourage you to write for today.
[time=901] We're going to go back to our live service now.
[time=903] Kevin Rose going to be ministering to us in song, and then we'll hear from our guest speaker, Dr. Ken Nichols from Alkehone, California.
[time=911] - Hi, it's Mothers.
[time=913] And just thank you for the way you've blessed us with a special person in our lives who've loved us unconditionally.
[time=922] Lord, that's just a small picture of how you've loved us.
[time=926] And we just thank you for our mothers, and we thank you for your love, the way you've expressed it to us through Jesus Christ.
[time=933] Thank you for the opportunity that we have now to show our love back to you, to be faithful to you in giving, and to do that with a cheerful heart.
[time=944] Just praying, Lord, that it would be used to glorify you, and that your work would be furthered.
[time=949] Thank you for these opportunities, in Jesus' name.
[time=951] [AMEN] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=1093] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 40 seconds]
[time=1153] (upbeat music) - The absence of our pastor today,
[time=1162] we have a special guest, Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1165] Formerly a member of our staff here at Black Hawk Baptist Church, he was here for five years and established the alive counseling ministry.
[time=1173] He's now the chairman of the psychology department at Christian Heritage College in Alkehone and also heads up the alive counseling ministry there at the Scott Memorial Baptist Church.
[time=1184] He also is working with Dr. David Jeremiah, the former pastor of Black Hawk.
[time=1189] I know that many of you are very glad to have Ken back with us.
[time=1192] I certainly am, we appreciate the relationship that we've had throughout the years and we welcome him now to Black Hawk, the Lord bless you Ken as you speak.
[time=1199] - We arrived in town yesterday afternoon
[time=1206] and I've had an opportunity in that brief time to go buy my own old homestead and to visit with a few of you, it is such a delight to be here and to recognize so many folks from the past.
[time=1218] We had the privilege yesterday of taking a tour of your new sanctuary.
[time=1224] What a delightful thing.
[time=1226] We, in our own spirit, so rejoice with God's blessing and success continuing here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and we look back with a great deal of appreciation.
[time=1236] This church took me right out of my graduate program into a counseling ministry here and as many of you recall, I did not want to teach or preach.
[time=1247] Just give me an office and a few people with minor problems and lock me up and I was sort of content with that.
[time=1253] And then pastor Jeremiah said, Ken, how would you like to speak at the Summer Bible Conference?
[time=1257] And I thought, well, good, you know, 20, 25 minute message once.
[time=1261] And he said, for the month of July.
[time=1265] Now, I was so anxious about that and some of you graciously remember that with me but I was so anxious about the responsibility to teach and to preach for that entire month.
[time=1274] And I'll never forget my first message in this church.
[time=1277] Some of you are still trying to forget.
[time=1280] I stood up here and the more anxious I became the higher my voice got.
[time=1288] I got to the invitation, every head bowed, every eye closed.
[time=1295] Oh, it was terrible, such a struggle.
[time=1299] And so I look back at some of those times as opportunities to learn how to communicate and to learn how to be used of God in a different avenue of ministry than just the counseling office.
[time=1309] They mentioned that we did bring some tapes available or with us today that are available.
[time=1314] This series is on pride and anger and each series has a four lesson cassettes with them and they each have a study guide with all the biblical references, et cetera.
[time=1326] And there's a series on stress and marriage and family and self-esteem and purpose in life, several other areas.
[time=1334] And for those of you who personally struggle with pride and anger, when you go to the tape table, tell them that you're buying them for a friend.
[time=1341] You know, you won't have to admit that, all right?
[time=1344] Now, the topic that I want to talk about
[time=1350] in the time that we have today is a topic that absolutely everybody can identify with.
[time=1355] As a matter of fact, it's a topic in a subject that without exception, everyone who seeks professional help must deal with and that is the topic of fear.
[time=1365] The Bible says that fear hath torment
[time=1371] and however otherwise different in the counseling office, people who are dealing with problems in marriage or personality or emotional difficulties or vocational occupational choices, interpersonal conflicts, invariably they must also learn to cope with a major component of fear.
[time=1390] Now, I want to do a couple of things by way of introduction.
[time=1395] I want to help you understand the significance of learning to deal with the emotion of fear in your life in order to allow to maximize your spiritual commitment and your testimony in your Christian living.
[time=1409] Couple of things you need to understand about fear.
[time=1410] If you did a word study in the Hebrew and the Greek and the Old Testament and New Testament, there are many varieties of the meaning of the word fear.
[time=1421] There is one type of word that talks about an attitude of cowardice.
[time=1426] It's part of your character that you're just sort of an intimidated soul and you are frightened by lots of things and that's your style of life.
[time=1434] You're uncomfortable if you can't think of a reason to be afraid.
[time=1437] There's another kind of fear that just simply means that's the spontaneous emotional response.
[time=1442] Something happens and you are spontaneously frightened.
[time=1448] My wife and I, when we travel together, we'll be going down the highway and she will notice something that she assumes I did not notice and a car coming out of the side and she'll, "Ken!" like that.
[time=1459] Now, my response is very spontaneous.
[time=1462] I don't have to say to myself, "Self, please respond with fear." You know, just, that's a type of fear.
[time=1467] That's the emotion of fear.
[time=1469] But for the purpose of our study today, there's a type of fear that is clearly talked about in Old and New Testament, clearly illustrated in Old and New Testament, which has to do with a controlling manipulative sinful fear.
[time=1487] It's obvious that the emotion of fear is not sinful.
[time=1491] You cannot avoid the experience or the emotion of fear.
[time=1496] So that can't be our goal.
[time=1498] But the Bible talks about the kind of fear that is controlling a pervasive kind of fear in our lives that is always sinful.
[time=1508] As a matter of fact, the Bible refers to that kind of fear.
[time=1512] Now watch this, as idolatry.
[time=1514] Well, how can that be?
[time=1517] Well, you see, if we allow the kinds of fears to come into our lives that control us and harass us and manipulate us, then it simply means and is viewed by God that we have more respect for the feared object than we do for the sovereign God's power to resolve and sustain us in the midst of our life difficulty.
[time=1542] And so he views it as a form of idolatry.
[time=1545] So that's the kind of fear we're talking about as we develop our message today.
[time=1550] Now there's a second thing that I want you to understand in terms of the significance of this topic.
[time=1554] And that has to do with the idea that God utilizes fear as an opportunity to develop our faith.
[time=1566] As I got into this study, that had never occurred to me before.
[time=1571] I looked in the Old Testament and I began to realize
[time=1577] that over and over again, God would allow the children of Israel to face formidable foes in possible circumstances.
[time=1585] And their hearts would be overwhelmed with fear and God would enable them to have their faith stretched.
[time=1594] Now you have a big decision to make today.
[time=1597] You have to decide.
[time=1599] You have the responsibility and the privilege to decide how you will respond to fear.
[time=1605] Can't avoid it.
[time=1607] You cannot not be afraid, but God has given to us in our spirit a grand privilege and responsibility to determine how I want to respond to fear.
[time=1618] Will it be my friend and motivate me to greater heights of faith and confidence and trust?
[time=1624] Will it be my foe and really be a source of torment and harassment and spiritual defeat?
[time=1630] And the choice is mine.
[time=1632] And as we develop this today, I want to just have this fixed in your mind the type of fear is idolatry.
[time=1638] It's controlling and manipulative.
[time=1639] And then secondly, the idea that God utilizes the fears of life as an opportunity, a workshop designed by God to develop faith in your heart.
[time=1649] Let me give a couple of New Testament illustrations, but before I do that, I want you to turn to Psalm 46 and then we'll go to Psalm 27.
[time=1656] Psalm 46 for our biblical backdrop.
[time=1666] Psalm 46 reads, "God is our refuge and strength,
[time=1672] "a very present help in trouble.
[time=1675] "Therefore we will not fear." Now watch this, though the earth be removed.
[time=1681] Now folks, look up here just a minute.
[time=1684] Would that be just a little bit frightening?
[time=1686] I mean, when you think about fears, that would be a rather dramatic cause.
[time=1690] You wake up one day and you say, "Oh, good grief.
[time=1692] "Somebody took the earth," you know?
[time=1694] So the Bible uses this kind of dramatic illustration to say that if the earth is removed, if the mountains fall into the midst of the sea, though its waters roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with its swelling, but God.
[time=1711] I will not fear, though I face formidable foes in life, though I face things in life that are way beyond my ability to control and understand because God has enabled me in the midst of my fear to have my heart quieted by faith.
[time=1726] I guarantee you, fear will silence your faith or supernatural faith will silence your fear.
[time=1734] It is your choice.
[time=1735] It is a matter of how we want to respond.
[time=1738] Now turn to Psalm 27, if you will.
[time=1740] Psalm 27 reads, "The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[time=1747] "Whom shall I fear?
[time=1749] "The Lord is my strength, in the strength of my life, "of whom shall I be afraid.
[time=1755] "Though an army should encamp against me, "my heart shall not fear, though war should rise against me, "in this I will be confident." So the Bible gives us some idea of the importance, the significance of learning to deal with fear and respond to fear supernaturally and biblically.
[time=1776] "Be not afraid, nor dismayed, by reason of this great "maltitude for the battle is not yours.
[time=1781] "It belongs to God, behold I am the God of salvation.
[time=1785] "Is there anything too hard for me?" These types of references remind us over and over again of the importance of learning how to respond to fear by asking God to develop our faith.
[time=1797] Now let's look in the New Testament, Matthew chapter eight, if you will.
[time=1806] Verse 23, "Now when he got into a boat,
[time=1814] "his disciples followed him, and suddenly a great tempest "to rose on the sea, so that the boat was covered "with the waves, but he was asleep.
[time=1823] "Then his disciples came to him and awoke him, saying, "Lord, save us, for we are perishing.
[time=1829] "But he said to them, 'Why are you so fearful, "O ye of little faith.'" There is a direct relationship between the fears of life and the faith of God.
[time=1844] Another illustration will help.
[time=1846] Let's look at Matthew chapter 14.
[time=1847] Verses 24 through 32, Matthew chapter 14,
[time=1853] starting with verse 24.
[time=1855] But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
[time=1863] Now in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them walking on the sea, and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were very troubled, saying, "It is a ghost, and they cried out for fear." But he immediately, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Be of good cheer, it is I, don't be afraid." Now Peter decided that it would be okay to walk on the water.
[time=1885] He asked Jesus for permission.
[time=1887] He said, "Can I walk to you, Jesus?" And Jesus said, "That would be all right." And he got out of the boat and started walking toward Jesus, and then he began to sing.
[time=1894] Verse 30 at the latter part of that, "Lord, save me," he cried out.
[time=1899] And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him and said to him, "O ye of little faith." So by way of introduction, I just want you to remember,
[time=1914] it's the kind of fear that is controlling, manipulative, harassing, idolatry that we're talking about today.
[time=1922] Not the emotion of fear, not the experience of fear.
[time=1926] And then secondly, I want to be able to draw into your mind's imagination the direct relationship between fear and faith.
[time=1931] How you respond to fear determines the ability to grow in Christ.
[time=1936] And Satan, as you can well imagine, loves to utilize the fears of life to cause us to fall in our spiritual relationship.
[time=1946] I want to talk first of all about some of the sources of fear that we experience.
[time=1950] There is perhaps no end to the list of probable sources.
[time=1953] In fact, if I gave you an opportunity, you would be able, right now, some of you have your heart beating more rapidly because you know today you're facing the kind of fear in your life that is very troubling.
[time=1965] And you're thinking, "Good grief, how did he know?" And you're facing things in your life that are out of your control, things that you don't know how to handle.
[time=1973] I remember so very well, a couple of years ago, I had a young lady, delightful Christian lady, about 26 years old, came to me for professional counseling.
[time=1981] She was expecting her first child.
[time=1984] You would think an occasion of rejoicing.
[time=1986] I couldn't understand why the pastor had referred her to me for counseling and I began to talk with her.
[time=1991] And in her teenage years, she had had an abortion.
[time=1995] Tragedy of tragedies in her life in a traumatic event that she didn't know how to deal with in an appropriate way.
[time=2001] And some, I believe insensitive and perhaps uncaring Christian said, "Well, I'll tell you what, God will forgive you, but there will be judgment and perhaps the judgment will be that you'll never be able to have any children of your own." Now, those of you who are not trained in professional counseling, do you detect that that is not very insensitive?
[time=2019] All right?
[time=2020] So she had this seed thought sown in her mind and she for nine months lived under manipulative and controlling and harassing fear.
[time=2031] Oh God, I don't want my baby to die.
[time=2035] God, I didn't mean to do that.
[time=2036] I asked you to forgive me or for nine months because she had been tormented by fear and Satan had her totally manipulated by an adulterous fear.
[time=2049] I don't know what your source of fear is.
[time=2052] It certainly probably is not that dramatic, but I know some that all of us can relate to.
[time=2057] I had read a recent research article about AIDS, the new AIDS epidemic.
[time=2061] Do you realize that they're believing now that there is going to be in the long haul greater physiological and psychological consequences to those who never get to the disease because of fear worrying about it?
[time=2082] It's amazing.
[time=2083] That is amazing to me that people are beginning to experience a paralyzing fear, refusing to eat in restaurants and to go to public restrooms and to be around people and to all kinds of things they're doing because their life now is being harassed and controlled by fear and fear will torment you.
[time=2104] Well, some of you are worried about your finances.
[time=2107] The economy, your work, your health, your children.
[time=2117] Some of you have secret sins and you just live from time to time with the unbelievable fear that someday that's going to be known.
[time=2127] For whatever reason, it'll come blasting out of your past and you'll be embarrassed and it'll be a very terrible experience in your life, and so it has the hold of your heart and it spoils your present because you're worried about the past.
[time=2142] Gotcha.
[time=2143] That's idolatry.
[time=2145] If we allow the fears of our past and our present to control and manipulate us, it means that we need to be stretched in our faith.
[time=2152] Financial pressures, phobias, panic attacks,
[time=2158] there really is no end to the list of probable causes or sources of fear.
[time=2162] What is yours?
[time=2163] What gets to you quickest in terms of causing panic and fear in your heart?
[time=2170] And then we need to ask ourselves, does the fear prompt you to respond knowing it's an opportunity for faith or does it, is it the first step towards spiritual and emotional paralysis?
[time=2182] One author writes, fear has reached an epidemic proportion in America.
[time=2188] It is contagious.
[time=2189] We become infected by it and pass it on to others.
[time=2192] It's like a disease.
[time=2193] Fear saps our energy and robs us of the joy of life.
[time=2197] We've talked about the significance, how God uses it
[time=2203] and the kind of fear we're talking about.
[time=2205] We've mentioned briefly the sources of fear.
[time=2208] They're everywhere.
[time=2209] You don't have to go to workshop on how to be afraid they're just everywhere.
[time=2213] There's always sources of fear.
[time=2216] I want to talk for a few minutes now about the symptoms.
[time=2219] What is the impact of fear in our lives?
[time=2221] How does it affect us?
[time=2222] And there are three that I want to mention.
[time=2224] First of all, I know for certain that a controlling fear causes your thinking to be distorted.
[time=2232] When we are under the pressure of a chronic fear, our mind becomes funny.
[time=2238] It doesn't become trustworthy.
[time=2240] There are thought distortions that can directly be traced to the inability to deal with fear in an appropriate way.
[time=2247] Let me illustrate.
[time=2248] Now, don't elbow anybody when I mention these.
[time=2251] But here's one that most people are familiar with.
[time=2254] There are some people here perhaps today who have a fear about their house being broken into.
[time=2261] And so, 22 times a night, you lock the door.
[time=2265] I'm serious.
[time=2268] I mean, it's time to go to bed, right?
[time=2269] So what do you normally do?
[time=2270] We go and we check the doors.
[time=2271] We lock them.
[time=2273] We're in bed two minutes.
[time=2274] And we think to ourselves, I wonder if I remember to lock that door.
[time=2277] So we get up and we lock the door.
[time=2279] Now, folks, can you see that that's just slightly irrational, all right?
[time=2283] But it's a fear that causes us to do that.
[time=2286] The statistical probability of a door unlocking itself is very slight, but we do it.
[time=2294] Our thoughts become untrustworthy.
[time=2297] And we do things that are prompted by fear rather than reality.
[time=2302] Things that are prompted by fear rather than the attitude of faith and confidence in Christ.
[time=2307] An ability to relax instead of being manipulated by that.
[time=2315] Well, not only is there sort of a mental distortion, thought problems, but there are emotional problems that can directly be related to fear out of control.
[time=2324] That's why the Bible refers to it as fear-half torment.
[time=2328] The root word for the word worry means divided mind, thought distortions.
[time=2333] The root word for the word anxiety means to strangle.
[time=2337] And there are people as a direct result of fears in their lives, they just feel choked by it.
[time=2342] It causes them to experience various and ascendary emotional problems and pressures that get in their way.
[time=2348] And as you look into the Old Testament, didn't they experience that as they face different problems?
[time=2352] They were so much in trouble in their emotions and anger and fear and worry and depression 'cause they didn't understand that God many times allows the things in life to be out of our control.
[time=2365] So that when we experience the spontaneous emotion of fear,
[time=2371] it'll be a reminder of our need to develop faith.
[time=2375] Well, I know that there are thought distortions.
[time=2379] So that's one problem.
[time=2380] I know that there are real problems with our emotional makeup.
[time=2384] And then finally, do you know that one of the symptoms of fear is physical?
[time=2388] Distortions and despair and then thirdly, disease.
[time=2394] Nearly 60% of hospital admissions have a major emotional contributor to the physical disorder.
[time=2401] The three best-selling drugs on the market today are the treatment for ulcers, hypertension, anxiety.
[time=2408] Why?
[time=2410] Fear?
[time=2411] Migraine headaches and backaches and chest pains and all kinds of physical disorders can directly be traced to a fear that has been allowed to get out of control.
[time=2425] Now, I do not take away from the legitimacy of the causes or the sources of fear.
[time=2430] They are legitimate, rational, reasonable, human causes for fear.
[time=2434] But we cannot allow it to take over our lives because then we experience these various kinds of symptoms and problems.
[time=2440] Did it ever occur to you that one of the reasons why God gave us so many warnings in the scriptures regarding fear is because he loves us.
[time=2449] And not only does he want us to be stretched in our faith spiritually, but he wants us to be aware of the fact that there are many consequences to the inability to have our faith in God.
[time=2459] Physical, emotional, interpersonal, various and eccentric conflicts that we experience because of fear out of control.
[time=2468] Now, some of you have different kind of phobias perhaps, fears of heights or close places.
[time=2475] You maybe have seen someone really overreact hysterically.
[time=2480] And just recently, our neighbor's house was burnt down and it was an act of satanic worshipers.
[time=2485] He was a pastor and they torched it and his house burnt to the ground.
[time=2489] And I heard somebody banging on the door and it was a door across the street and I ran out and I looked over just enough to see that there was a fire and I ran back into the house and I picked up our fire extinguisher and I ran across only to find how futile that was.
[time=2504] Totally, totally helpless situation.
[time=2508] And some of you have that kind of ability to deal with fears.
[time=2512] It rages within your heart and you feel like you take a little home fire extinguisher to a home that's burning down.
[time=2517] As I interviewed and talked to the family, they came to our house that night and they were there till about two in the morning with their family and trying to figure out what to do.
[time=2525] But she shared with me that all of her life she had been controlled with a fear of fire.
[time=2529] For whatever reason, she had been terrified by the possibility of her home being burnt down and now had to figure out how to deal with that and had an opportunity either to be more and more manipulated by it or to learn more and more how to deal with it in a way that would be honoring to God.
[time=2547] You know, I mentioned her, I guess pastor Pete mentioned that we'd been in California now for a couple of years and one of the things that I miss in California is storms.
[time=2555] Some of you are afraid of storms, lightning and thunder and I wanna tell you in California, they really freak out.
[time=2560] I mean, if they ever ever lightning or thunder out there, they hide under the bed and I love it.
[time=2564] See, I came from the Midwest and I really miss that.
[time=2566] In fact, this last summer I was speaking at Moody Bible Institute in a graduate course and I called my family and I said, "Do things I want while I'm in the Midwest." Number one, I definitely want sweet corn.
[time=2576] Now they make rather good sweet corn in California but it comes from south of the border, can't even speak English, let alone taste good.
[time=2582] So, you know, so I miss Midwest sweet corn.
[time=2585] So I said, "I want sweet corn." And number two, I'm gonna be praying for a storm, love storms.
[time=2589] Now my mother is scared of storms, all right?
[time=2591] So she wasn't real sure about that and she was praying that I was out of fellowship with God.
[time=2594] But anyway, I'm praying for a real storm.
[time=2597] Now this is a true story.
[time=2598] This is exactly how this happened.
[time=2600] One evening, unbeknownst to the weather man, a storm begins to brew.
[time=2602] My father says, "Oh, it's just heat lightning." I said, "You don't know, you know?" So, I mean, it started to lightning and thunder and it was a terrible storm and all of a sudden, bang.
[time=2614] A bolt of lightning came down and hit a tree in my sister's front yard and blew it to smithereens.
[time=2619] I mean, it just blew it apart.
[time=2620] I'm loving it, amen, oh, oh.
[time=2623] Then I said, "That's enough, Lord.
[time=2624] You know, you can overdo something like this." But it did.
[time=2627] I mean, there were wood fragments all over the yard, my mom screaming and asking me to back off, you know, and hiding.
[time=2632] (audience laughing) And what I did, I went to the trophy shop and I got a little plaque made up for the stump of the tree 'cause it just destroyed it.
[time=2641] And I put this little plaque on the stump of the tree.
[time=2643] It reads like this, "Here remains the stump of a tree, an indication of how God loves me.
[time=2650] I prayed for a storm to cheer my heart.
[time=2652] And God sent a bolt of lightning and blew this tree apart." (audience laughing) Amen, oh, yes, sir.
[time=2662] You know what, I put it to top of it?
[time=2663] At the top of the plaque, I put Kenny's Prayer Tower.
[time=2666] Now there are two in the world.
[time=2667] (audience laughing) So, all right.
[time=2670] Now let me take just a few minutes to give an illustration of what fear can do to you.
[time=2678] It's a true story taken out of World War II.
[time=2681] During the bombing raids of London, from time to time, people would hear the sire when they would go to their air raid shelters.
[time=2687] And one time, a bomb landed very closely to the shelter.
[time=2690] About 500 people in the shelter.
[time=2692] No one was actually injured, but it took them nearly 48 hours to dig them out.
[time=2697] And they discovered that nearly 300 people had died of fear.
[time=2703] No physical damage, terrified, frightened to death.
[time=2710] And if we allow the fears of this world to encroach into our spiritual life and to our emotional resources and into our thinking patterns, it will eat us up.
[time=2722] It will cause all kind of pain and problems physically and emotionally and meritally and spiritually.
[time=2728] You cannot not be afraid, but we have a great privilege given of God to figure out how we want to respond to the fear supernaturally, biblically, as an opportunity to be stretched in my faith.
[time=2740] And that's what God really has designed.
[time=2742] We've talked about the significance.
[time=2747] We've talked about some of the sources and the symptoms of fear.
[time=2752] And now finally, in the time that we have left, let me just focus for a few minutes on the solutions to fear.
[time=2758] So what are we to do?
[time=2760] How am I able to combat this kind of fear in my life?
[time=2765] I want you to turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians chapter 13, if you will.
[time=2769] 1 Corinthians 13.
[time=2778] You're familiar with this very great love chapter in the scriptures.
[time=2791] I want to focus though primarily on the last verse of this chapter, 1 Corinthians 13, 13, and now abide faith, hope, and love.
[time=2799] These three, but the greatest of these is love.
[time=2803] Now for my own notes, I have these three words alliterated and I have faith as courage.
[time=2811] I have confidence, which is hope.
[time=2816] In fact, the root word for hope is confident expectation.
[time=2821] And then I have compassion.
[time=2825] The three ingredients which will enable us little by little, one step at a time to learn to deal with the everyday fears of life is courage, that's faith, confidence, that's hope, and compassion, that's love.
[time=2843] Now it may be a little bit strange to you to wonder how these fit, but let me just refer you now to 1 John chapter four verse 18, if you have your Bibles.
[time=2851] 1 John 4 18.
[time=2852] There is no fear in love, but perfect love cast out fear
[time=2862] because fear involves torment, but he who fears has not been made perfect in love.
[time=2869] You see, as we have as one of our primary goals in our spiritual lives to ever increase our reservoir of supernatural love and compassion for God and for others, we make less and less likely the probability or the possibility of being controlled by fear because fear and love do not co-exist.
[time=2891] Perfect love cast out fear and so as I focus in my heart on my love for God and my love for others and my love for his word and my love for his spirit and my love for service, I am not so much distracted by the fears that I face every day of my life.
[time=2908] So love is part of it.
[time=2910] The Bible says if you have everything in the whole world and you don't have love, you're in trouble.
[time=2915] Love is the perfect bond of unity.
[time=2919] Supernatural love is the ingredient upon which we can base our confidence and our courage to face our fears.
[time=2926] That's the way God has designed it.
[time=2927] They are very intricately, sensitively woven together.
[time=2931] There are 366 fear knots in the Bible.
[time=2937] Now watch this, almost without exception, each fear knot is followed by a mandate to faith
[time=2948] or a reminder of God's faithfulness.
[time=2950] Fear knot, why?
[time=2954] Because I'm stretching your faith.
[time=2956] It's an opportunity, not an obstacle.
[time=2960] It's your friend, not foe.
[time=2962] It's triumph, not torment, why?
[time=2964] Because it's an opportunity to know more about God personally and spiritually and supernaturally.
[time=2970] And so now as I face my fears, something happens in my mind and in my heart and in my lifestyle that reminds me of God.
[time=2978] And I say, well, I'm so afraid.
[time=2980] Help me God to grow and to know more of you.
[time=2985] I know that you perhaps will not even take me out of the circumstances, but I know I can trust you.
[time=2991] I wanna learn to trust you.
[time=2992] So thank you for this frightening situation.
[time=2995] Allow me to grow by it.
[time=2997] So let's see, these 366 fear knots are a mandate to faith
[time=3004] or a reminder of his faithfulness.
[time=3006] He's trustworthy.
[time=3007] Listen to some of these illustrations.
[time=3009] We need to have faith in God's power.
[time=3011] Jeremiah 32, 27, behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh, is there anything too hard for me?
[time=3018] We need to have faith in his power.
[time=3020] Oh, but Lord, faith in his power.
[time=3025] We need to have faith in his purpose.
[time=3026] Some of you right now are facing major changes in your life.
[time=3031] Major decisions vocationally or occupationally are personally or meritally, and you cannot for the life of you figure it out.
[time=3038] But God has a purpose, and my fear is focused on the fact that I don't understand his purpose, and my faith is focused on the fact that I can trust it.
[time=3049] God has a purpose, faith in his purpose, in his power, faith in his provision, faith in his protection.
[time=3057] He promises that.
[time=3062] Do you believe him?
[time=3063] He promises protection in our lives.
[time=3066] Faith in his presence.
[time=3068] It amazes me that God, the Holy Spirit, dwells within my, he is ever present with me.
[time=3074] And my faith is based on that knowledge of God's presence, and I have faith in his presence with me.
[time=3083] I will never leave the nor forsake thee.
[time=3086] Thou will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on the Isaiah 26, 3.
[time=3093] Faith in his peace.
[time=3095] Matthew says, why are you so worried about so many things?
[time=3100] You just worry and worry and worry.
[time=3102] Some of you have a nature to worry.
[time=3105] You're nervous if you can't think of a reason to be worried.
[time=3108] In fact, someone has referred in a book that I read that worry is like a rocking chair.
[time=3112] It gives you something to do, but doesn't get you anywhere.
[time=3115] Can you see that?
[time=3117] How are things terrible?
[time=3119] How are they going to be tomorrow?
[time=3121] Much worse, thank you.
[time=3123] You know, faith in his power and his purpose, his provision, his protection, faith in his presence, faith in his peace and faith in his promises.
[time=3137] God has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness.
[time=3142] He has provided for us in his scripture, marvelous resource to deal with the difficulties of life.
[time=3147] And you will never escape the difficulties of life.
[time=3149] You will never escape the fearful circumstances in life.
[time=3153] How you respond to them.
[time=3154] How you see them through your own spiritual perspective will enable you to learn from them or be controlled by them, which according to the scriptures is idolatry.
[time=3166] Thomas Neale has stated,
[time=3173] "The Lord will either calm your storms of fear "or allow the storms to rage "while he calms your heart." One or the other is his obligation to his believers.
[time=3188] There's a true story and perhaps I have referenced it before, but during the time of the Alaskan pipeline construction, there was a Piper airplane that took about six or eight men on a research expedition and unbeknownst to them and certainly unexpected a great blizzard and storm came up.
[time=3208] Now they had to land the plane about 500 or 600 miles from the nearest village.
[time=3214] So they landed the plane in the midst of the storm and the newspaper headlines assumed that they were dead and certainly they were lost and so everybody was upset about that.
[time=3223] They contacted the families, brought them in from all around the country and they waited.
[time=3228] And finally the storm broke and they went out and obviously the snow would cover the Christ like they could not find them.
[time=3234] Now watch this, true story.
[time=3237] Several weeks later, these men showed up in the village that had been 600 miles away, all alive.
[time=3246] Well they summoned the ABC and CBS and the press came in, they were interviewing the guy, "How in the world did you do this?
[time=3252] "How did you manage to walk 600 miles "through some of the most unforgiving terrain "in the country during the dead of where?" He cleared his throat and he looked square into the eyes of the interviewer and he said, "Oh, we didn't walk 600 miles." He said, "You didn't?" No, he said, "You know, we walked one mile 600 times." You see the difference?
[time=3273] I'll tell you what, when you measure the formidable foe of fear in your life, it is a big 600 mile trip.
[time=3282] But I want you to be encouraged in your heart that God has given to us in his wonderful word, the ability one step at a time to have ever increased success at managing our fears.
[time=3295] Oh, you don't have to be a victim.
[time=3297] You don't have to be an idolater.
[time=3299] You don't have to be controlled by fears.
[time=3301] It is God's written word that enables us to have the courage to take one step at a time.
[time=3309] The confidence in who he is, the compassion that fills our hearts and chases away fear, that little by little enables us to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.
[time=3323] I trust your encouraged.
[time=3324] I trust your spirit is charged up to recognize that you do not have to be on the losing side.
[time=3330] I thank God for His word and for the truth of His word.
[time=3333] I want us to sing together in closing, hymn number 418.
[time=3337] Now, I want to just briefly give an invitation.
[time=3341] It is perhaps possible that I'm here by divine appointment and someone is here in the auditorium today who needs to take that first step to deal with inordinate fears in life by committing your heart and life to Jesus Christ.
[time=3353] You may need to be born again to accept Jesus into your heart and to have experience forgiveness of sins.
[time=3359] We invite you to come.
[time=3359] Our pastors will be here to greet you.
[time=3362] You may have other kinds of special needs that you would like someone to pray with you and to be an encouragement to you.
[time=3367] So we invite you to come, but now listen to this.
[time=3370] As we sing this song, I want you to watch the words and that as we stand and sing together, I want you to have a spirit of praise and gratitude and thanksgiving because we're going to sing together.
[time=3386] Faith is the victory.
[time=3387] And let's sing it as our way of saying thank you, dear God, for giving me the opportunity to deal with the fears of life in such a way that I can become more like you.
[time=3398] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for our fellowship together today around the Word of God.
[time=3403] I thank you for the thoroughness of your instruction.
[time=3406] I thank you for the encouragement of your word in our hearts.
[time=3411] Now, as we sing together, we pray that the Spirit of God would be able to work in the individual lives, the people who need to make decisions publicly would do that.
[time=3420] And then for the rest of us, as we sing, we just want to sing with a spirit of celebration, thanking you for who you are and for your trustworthiness that we can take one step at a time dealing with life's difficulties and the fears that come so very frequently.
[time=3436] We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3442] Let's stand together, please, as we sing Him number 418.
