[time=90] (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) (bells ringing) The marathon is 26 miles and 385 yards.
[time=119] As the runner finishes the race in the Olympics, that last 385 yards is in the arena.
[time=126] In my mind's eye, I can still see the great Swiss runner, Gabriela Anderson-Cheese.
[time=133] As she had finished the 26 miles and come into the stadium, all the crowd arose to watch her finish.
[time=141] It wasn't because she was the fastest.
[time=143] She was about to finish 15th.
[time=146] Why would they come to their feet to watch the 15th runner?
[time=150] Because she was the one that refused to quit.
[time=154] Staggering in exhaustion is nearly passing out.
[time=158] Half the crowd was yelling helper.
[time=160] The other half-gilling run.
[time=161] The question was, would she quit?
[time=166] In our life's marathon, the question is this.
[time=169] Will we quit?
[time=171] (dramatic music)
[time=181] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=184] Thank you for joining us.
[time=185] Rick's message today is taken from the Book of Colossians and is entitled "A Good View from a Bad Spot." Finishing the race was Paul's greatest desire.
[time=194] His life was approaching the finish line.
[time=197] One final lap to go, prison.
[time=199] Would he quit? Would he finish?
[time=201] Colossians was written from prison.
[time=203] Paul's final lap in his lifelong marathon.
[time=207] We see the race through his eyes.
[time=209] We get a good view from a bad place.
[time=211] What do we see?
[time=213] Christ. Christ preeminent.
[time=215] Christ supreme.
[time=217] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Colossians chapter 1.
[time=221] Our special music includes a song from the sanctuary choir.
[time=227] Joanie King and the Handbell Choir.
[time=233] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=241] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=247] Now here's Rick.
[time=252] Our friends who are joining us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=266] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=271] Tonight our evening service is a children's concert, and we have our stage all prepared for that tonight, so the choir is out front, and they always put the short guys in the back.
[time=283] I don't understand that, but we're glad that you're here, and I'm glad that the choir is here too.
[time=289] They have a beautiful song to sing for us now.
[time=291] It's sung acapella, and as the beauty of those human voices are lifted and praised, I hope that it captures your heart and your imagination for the Lord.
[time=308] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=453] - We are fortunate indeed when the singer left the Earth,
[time=460] he said he'd send a comforter.
[time=461] The comforter has come.
[time=463] Let us rejoice as we sing together, 249.
[time=466] Him number 249 will sing the first, the third, and fourth, stanzas together.
[time=472] [MUSIC - 156 seconds]
[time=658] I thought for a moment there I'd get to recite the verse and have lots of people standing beside me, but they disappeared on me, so I guess we have to count on you.
[time=666] Let's stand please as we recite the memory verse for this week.
[time=670] Philippians 4, 4, and 5.
[time=676] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=679] I will say it again, rejoice.
[time=683] Let your gentleness be evident to all.
[time=686] The Lord is near.
[time=688] Philippians 4, 4, and 5.
[time=691] Thank you very much, you may be seated.
[time=694] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=719] If you could see where I once was, if you could walk with me back to where I started from,
[time=735] and I know you would see the miracle of love that took me in his sweet embrace.
[time=748] And made me what I am today, a sin is saved by grace.
[time=764] I'm just a sin new, saved by grace.
[time=776] When I stood, condemned to death, he took my place.
[time=786] And now I grow and breathe in freedom, and with every breath I take, I'm loved and broken again.
[time=801] I stand with the living, for I'm just a sin new, saved by grace.
[time=815] [MUSIC]
[time=825] How could I boast of anything I've ever seen or done?
[time=834] How could I dare to claim his mind the victories he has won?
[time=845] Where would I be a god that brought me gently to this place?
[time=855] I'm here to save, I'm nothing that a sin is saved by grace.
[time=869] I'm just a sin, saved by grace.
[time=880] When I stood, condemned to death, he took my place.
[time=890] And now I grow and breathe in freedom, and with every breath I take, I'm loved and broken again.
[time=906] I stand with the living, for I'm just a sin new, saved by grace.
[time=919] I'm just a sin, saved by grace.
[time=933] When I stood, condemned to death, he took my place.
[time=944] And now I grow and breathe in freedom, and with every breath I take, I'm loved and broken again.
[time=959] I stand with the living, for I'm just a sin, saved by grace.
[time=989] [APPLAUSE]
[time=997] Hello, and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=1000] It's a privilege for me to welcome you today as I missed last week being on vacation, and I'm delighted to be back here.
[time=1007] Rick, you look tan and refreshed, and we're glad that you had the opportunity to get away for a couple of weeks, but we welcome you back to Black Hall.
[time=1014] Coming home is our second favorite thing, right after going away on vacation.
[time=1018] I can relate to that. It's nice to get away and have a break and then anticipate the ministry for the summer.
[time=1024] Well, Kathy and the kids and I had a great time, but we are thankful to be home.
[time=1028] There is, as the old adage states it, no place like home.
[time=1032] And our home is Fort Wayne, and our home is here at Black Hawk with you, and we're excited that you've joined us today.
[time=1038] Coming up in the near future is the 4th of July.
[time=1042] That probably seems quite a ways into the distance, but it's really only a matter of weeks.
[time=1047] And with the 4th of July, we present to you the Patriotic Panorama on the Sunday night just prior, which is July the 3rd this year.
[time=1054] Right, it's real close to July 4th. Rick, we've done some unusual things, and already we're beginning to have a prayer ban pray for no rain,
[time=1062] because our Patriotic Panorama this year is going to be outside on July 3rd at 4 o'clock.
[time=1068] During the day, from 1 to 3, we're going to have a chicken dinner, and our family of Black Hawk here is going to get together for a picnic,
[time=1075] and then the public is invited to come at 4 to hear the choir sing Patriotic Songs, and the King's Brass will be here.
[time=1083] That's 9 brass players, and they'll resound with great Patriotic music, and it's going to be a really nice afternoon out behind our new worship center.
[time=1092] Well, I'm looking forward to that. I am so thankful for this country, and I know that you are.
[time=1098] And when we think of the freedoms that we possess, we want to honor God in praise's name for our heritage,
[time=1104] and our opportunity to worship Him. That's what the Patriotic Panorama is all about.
[time=1109] We want you to join us on Sunday, July 3rd at 4 o'clock for our outdoor Patriotic Panorama, so we hope that you'll come.
[time=1118] Also, today we want to encourage you to write for a helpful booklet by Charles Windall called "When Your Comfort Zone Gets Squeezed."
[time=1127] I like that title. Each of us have a comfort zone, an area of our life where we function with great ease until somebody puts the squeeze on us.
[time=1137] And then we may become fearful, or irritable, we may become angry, or are we may become very upset, frustrated, sometimes paralyzed.
[time=1147] We all respond differently. But how would God want us to respond when our comfort zone gets squeezed?
[time=1154] Well, would you like to know what God has to say from one of the finest Bible teachers I know of, Chuck Swindall?
[time=1161] Then simply write to us today, and we'll send you your copy as a gift free from us to you.
[time=1166] This is a very excellent booklet, and if you'd like to receive it, write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1175] The zip code is 46815. Once again, the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1186] Thank you, Pete. Today, as we study God's Word, we'll begin a new series of messages studying through the New Testament book of Colossians.
[time=1195] This book is perhaps the greatest epistle of the New Testament, giving to us the deity of Jesus Christ.
[time=1205] It is the pinnacle of all that Paul wrote about the Lord Jesus.
[time=1210] While we're on vacation, I had the opportunity of just sitting with my Bible open and reading that short epistle many times,
[time=1217] and it filled my heart with devotion to Christ, and I'm looking forward to beginning that study with you today on Jesus Christ,
[time=1225] as Paul gives us him as preeminent over everything in the Book of Colossians.
[time=1231] Thanks for joining us today. We trust that God will use these moments together to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus.
[time=1247] [MUSIC - 64 seconds]
[time=1335] Brethren, we have met to worship. In God, we have come to worship you. We've set these moments aside, collected in this familiar place to exclusively look to you.
[time=1351] We want you to know that you're important. Not only you're important, but you demand the first attention of our life as we begin this new week.
[time=1364] God, we meet for ourselves because we need to be reminded that we live and move and have our being because of you.
[time=1373] Forgive us that we have this past week, lived a life that has ignored you too often, and we have missed the blessing that you have had for us because of it.
[time=1387] We've wallored in insignificance, chasing our dreams and accumulating our wealth and trying to fix our accidents.
[time=1402] When the greatest tragedy is, we've ignored you. And so this week, God, we've come for ourselves to be reminded that you are God and to worship you.
[time=1413] To sing songs, to praise you, to give our hearts devotion upward. We love you, Lord.
[time=1423] We love the life that you've given to us, and we want to thank you for the gift of life.
[time=1430] But most of all, we want to thank you for the gift of an abundant and eternal life through Christ.
[time=1437] We pray this morning for each heart that's here, that has never received Christ that they might today hear a voice, not mine, but yours, a spirit within them, calling them to Christ.
[time=1453] We pray for believers today, that there might come from your spirit and your word a challenge to walk faithfully.
[time=1462] We pray for comfort today for those who have lost loved ones, for Dave Johnson in Paulding, Ohio, who has lost his sister in a car accident.
[time=1474] For Francis Jeffers, who has lost her brother to heart attack, God, we ask you to give comfort to each one and to their families.
[time=1484] Pray that you'll give courage to those who are walking through difficult valleys, particularly to those who are battling cancer.
[time=1492] We pray today for those who have made spiritual decisions in recent days or weeks, that your spirit would fortify them, and they would not soon quit, but they'd be found faithful to you today, tomorrow, and through eternity.
[time=1509] Pray for broken relationships, that you'll give us forgiving spirits and less demanding expectations, for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1539] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=1631] Thank you, Bell Choir, for that rendition of Jesus, "Lover of My Soul." Jesus, "Lover of My Soul." Did you know that this morning?
[time=1644] Did you know that God actually cares for you? You say, "Well, how did I get into this circumstance if God really cares for me?"
[time=1654] I mean, if God really cares for me, why would I have that guy for a boss?
[time=1660] If God really cares for me, then why is my health such as it is?
[time=1668] If God really cares for me, why?
[time=1674] You know, it's interesting as you read the book of Colossians, Paul writes from prison, and he never once doubted that God cared for him, and he never said, "God, why am I in prison?"
[time=1684] It's one of the most amazing things I've ever read in my life, the book of Colossians.
[time=1689] Other than two passing allusions to the fact that he's in prison, this is one of the most determinative, upbeat letters I have ever read in my life.
[time=1700] There's only one letter that I think has more up-tempo than Colossians, and that's Philippians, and Paul wrote it first from the same prison, and then he sent something different to the Church of Colossae.
[time=1711] And this morning, we're going to begin a study in the book of Colossians.
[time=1716] It rings with such confidence that as I read it several times over the past week, I just got excited, excited about the Lord Jesus Christ and living for him.
[time=1729] I hope you do as well.
[time=1733] In athletics, the race of races is without a doubt the marathon, 26 miles plus an additional 385 yards.
[time=1748] In the 1984 Olympics, there was a spectacular finish in the women's marathon by a young lady, a Swiss gal, by the name of Gabriella.
[time=1757] As she approached the finishing line, the entire Colossian rose to their feet to watch her finish, but it wasn't to watch her win.
[time=1768] The winner had already crossed the finish line almost 20 minutes ago.
[time=1772] She was about to finish 15th. Who cares who finishes 15th?
[time=1779] But these people were not watching to see whether she finished 1st, 2nd, or 15th. They rose to see what she finished.
[time=1789] What you see is Gabriella had run her 26 miles through the streets of Los Angeles and entered the Colossian for her final lap.
[time=1798] Dehydration and fatigue and exhaustion had rendered her almost into an unconscious state.
[time=1808] Her running was no longer brisk strides, but staggering weak legs.
[time=1815] Her determination was not fixed at the goal line. She wandered like one drunk in a stupor, but this one not intoxication of alcohol but a fatigue.
[time=1827] She literally fell to the ground and crawled a few steps. Then pushing herself up on all fours bare crawled and then tried to stand and staggered and fell repeatedly.
[time=1844] The crowd had stood to their feet and some were yelling helper and medics rushed towards her to grab her, and as they went to grab her, she ran away.
[time=1854] She was still at the presence of mind to know that if they touched her, she would be disqualified.
[time=1860] So she staggered away and worked her way to the finish line, falling again when she made it.
[time=1870] The Colosseum stood and watched as she struggled and gasped, finally to the finish line, and literally tripped across it, passing out into the arms of the doctor.
[time=1889] But she had finished. Paul has run his life long marathon. He is at the end of his life.
[time=1902] He is finishing his last 300 and 85 yards, and his determination is to cross the line, to fall into the arms of Jesus, and hear him say, "Well done, now good in faithful servant."
[time=1925] He has one lap to go. He is under a death sentence. He has appealed it from Festus and Felix and Agrippa all the way to Rome. He's in chains. Death seems to be eminent, but he wants to finish for Christ.
[time=1949] And he pens this powerful letter that puts Jesus Christ in a preeminent supreme light as nothing else in all of the Scripture. His determination to finish the race.
[time=1965] If you have your Bible, I invite you to open it to Colossians chapter 1, and we will study this for weeks to come, but we begin today. Getting Paul's view, wouldn't you love to see the race from inside the eyes of the runner?
[time=1981] When you love to see the race, not from the stands, but to see it through eyes that can feel the heart as it's beating, that can sense the grasping of air, that can feel the sting of salty sweat dripping through it.
[time=1999] That's what Paul gives us here at the end of his race. He gives us a good view from a bad place, a clear view of Christ from a Roman prison.
[time=2012] Colossians 1, 1 and 2. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and Timothy, our brother, to the holy and faithful at Colossae, grace and peace to you from God, our Father.
[time=2037] This is a very typical introduction to an epistle of the New Testament. They wrote in a style somewhat different than ours. When we write a letter, we begin it usually dear whoever we're writing it to. I might write dear Kathy.
[time=2052] Then we give to them the text of what we want to say, and then we sign it with our name. And it's frustrating, isn't it, to get a letter and not know who that letter is from.
[time=2062] So these ancients wisely put their name first. Paul begins. Paul, that's what you want to know, isn't it, who's it from? Paul, then he identifies his writing with Timothy and then he gives the identification of his audience and a general greeting.
[time=2080] But even though that this is somewhat general, don't allow it to become generic. Have you seen the new generic postcards you can send? We were on vacation in Florida last week and we found all kinds of postcards.
[time=2093] There were those with dolphins from Sea Worlds in the coast of Florida and all the beaches and all, but we found generic postcards.
[time=2101] Generic postcards, they're all stark white on the front and they say generic. You turn them over and on the back it says dear and then you check mom, dad, brother, sister, friend, cat, dog.
[time=2115] Next section you check off. I am fine, great, not so good, bored, happy, and check it off. I hope that you are fine, sick, not so good. You check it off.
[time=2127] Please, cut my grass, send money, you need to check it off. Generic postcards.
[time=2134] Anyway, it's a common terror in our society, isn't it? We become generic people. Hi, how are you? We just pass on by.
[time=2142] But this is not generic. Yes, it's general. You could turn to Philippians, you could turn to Colossians and Corinthians and you'd find similarities, but it's not generic.
[time=2155] This is the heart of a man writing to people that he has never met, but he loves them to the point that he calls them brothers.
[time=2167] It's not generic. These are real people. It's coming from the real heart, the Apostle Paul.
[time=2174] So he begins with this identification of himself, Paul and Apostle. Now you and I have used that term often if we've been in churches at all. We hear the word Apostle, but what is an Apostle?
[time=2187] Well, in a very general way, the word Apostle is simply almost taking the Greek word and putting it in from Greek letters to English letters. It's the word "oppo-stello" and we want to change the letter and it came out.
[time=2201] There it is. But what is an "oppo-stello" and "oppo-stello"? Well, the word basically means one that is sent out.
[time=2210] It rings with a sense of formal mission. It's a little more than sending your teenager out to go to the corner store and bring back a gallon of milk.
[time=2219] It means somebody who is sent out with a representation. But in the New Testament, it had not only this general sentiment, it had a very specific meaning as well.
[time=2230] For you see, there were not only apostles, people were sent out, but there were apostles, a select group of people.
[time=2241] An apostle originally were those twelve disciples of Christ that he did choose himself.
[time=2250] Eleven were found faithful, one was a defector, Judas Ascariant. When Judas had betrayed Christ, he was overwhelmed with his own guilt and he hung himself.
[time=2264] Subsequently, the remaining eleven said we have to choose one from amongst us and they established the requirements to fill that office.
[time=2276] I want to point out two things from that. One, the New Testament sees the gift and office of apostleship as a very particular group.
[time=2287] There weren't forty eleven apostles. One was taken and they said we better replace one.
[time=2294] Second, I want you to see from that there was a particular requirement of an apostle and that requirement was they had to be an eyewitness of the resurrection of Christ.
[time=2304] So Paul now calls himself an apostle. Was he the one chosen and asked one? No, he was not.
[time=2312] But we come to Acts chapter 9. Paul has been a persecutor, his name is Saul.
[time=2318] He has consented to the death of Stephen. He even held their coats so the men could get a fuller swing as they would throw the stones.
[time=2328] But now, as he's going to Damascus to persecute more Christians, Jesus Christ, the resurrected Christ, appears to Paul and he calls Paul.
[time=2338] And he says you will be my apostle to the Gentiles. And now Paul is a unique apostle.
[time=2347] He has been called by Jesus as the originals had been called. He has seen the resurrected Christ as they had seen him.
[time=2355] He is in his own words an unusual apostle. He used the phrase one born out of due time.
[time=2361] In other words, everybody else was born properly. I came late. Unique.
[time=2367] Now, why am I saying all of this about what is an apostle? I'm saying it because I believe that there are no apostles today.
[time=2378] You see, if an apostle had to be an eyewitness of the resurrected Christ for an apostle today, that would mean that individual would need to be somewhere around 1950 years old.
[time=2392] Now, I had a Latin teacher that was close, but he wasn't even that old.
[time=2398] There aren't apostles today. Now, why am I making such a big deal out of there are no apostles today?
[time=2404] Someone will say, well, I believe God gives people to go out and to plant new churches like this church was planted, or like the Smiths are planting in Jamaica, or the Lesperons were planted in France, God willing.
[time=2417] I believe God does give people, but I don't believe he gives a gift of apostleship.
[time=2421] He had to be an eyewitness of the resurrected Christ.
[time=2424] Now, why do I make such a big deal out of that? Because you'll turn on your TV set some day.
[time=2429] You'll always come to church, but someday your kids are going to be homesick and you'll watch TV then.
[time=2434] And you'll turn the channel and you'll come and someone will say, I am an apostle.
[time=2439] Or you'll be driving the work and you'll push the button and you'll hear a radio station.
[time=2443] You'll hear some guy on there and he'll announce that he is an apostle.
[time=2447] And by that he is saying, I have authority over all the churches.
[time=2452] You know, when you were an apostle, you had authority. These apostles met and they had authority over the churches.
[time=2459] I don't believe anybody has authority over the church today, except for one person.
[time=2464] And that is Jesus Christ. He is the head of the church.
[time=2468] Now, within a local church, you may choose out men to lead, but they only have responsibility to lead in this church.
[time=2478] I do not have authority over the church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2483] Our board does not have authority over any other church.
[time=2488] Christ alone has that authority. There are not apostles today.
[time=2495] Notice that Paul identifies a co-author. Not that Timothy necessarily wrote this,
[time=2501] but that he was with him and they were of kindred heart. I find this fascinating.
[time=2505] He says, Paul and apostle by the will of God will come back to the will of God in a moment.
[time=2510] And Timothy, our brother, do you know that if there was such a thing as apostolic succession,
[time=2517] or if there was a gift of apostleship beyond Paul, the most logical candidate in all of the Bible would be Timothy?
[time=2526] Why do I say that?
[time=2528] One, Timothy was Paul's understudy. And when Paul passed the baton on, he passed it to Timothy.
[time=2538] When Paul could no longer go to the church's, Timothy was his chief spokesperson.
[time=2544] Does he call Timothy an apostle? Never. Not here, not anywhere in Scripture.
[time=2551] And if there were apostles, Timothy would have been the next.
[time=2556] Paul says that he is writing as Paul the apostle by the will of God.
[time=2561] I thought about that a great deal. Because you see, in these days, we find leaders
[time=2569] who are leading within the sphere of Christianity, who are doing it out of a different motive.
[time=2578] Let me tell you five things that I see common today amongst Christian leaders
[time=2587] that are different than the will of God.
[time=2591] Some are leading by self-appointment.
[time=2595] They've appointed themselves in a position of authority.
[time=2599] They've declared it, they've announced it, they are self-appointed leaders.
[time=2605] Others are leading out of self-achievement.
[time=2609] They feel that because they have been successful here, or they have done that over there, that they have earned a certain position, and now it's by achievement.
[time=2620] Others say they lead by self-advancement. They have earned their way along.
[time=2627] Some are serving out of self-accumulation. They have accumulated a loyal audience.
[time=2633] They have accumulated a massive organization, and that organization is very much like a southern military regime.
[time=2641] What I mean by a southern military regime, I mean like a Noriega.
[time=2646] A man who is in a position, and everybody is loyal to him so he can do whatever he wants.
[time=2651] Some are leading out of self-actualization.
[time=2654] Abraham Madslow, in his pyramid of human needs, put it to the very pinnacle of need,
[time=2660] is for human self-actualization, for me to say I am somebody.
[time=2665] And many are using their pulpits today or their platforms or their influence to say I am somebody.
[time=2671] I wasn't Paul. He wasn't self-advancing, self-accumulating, self-asserting.
[time=2676] I'm apostle by God's will.
[time=2679] You know who I think described this best was Billy Graham.
[time=2682] Billy Graham said, "I am nothing more than a turtle on a fence post." When I read that, I turned on a fence post. What does he mean, a turtle on a fence post?
[time=2694] He explains. He said, "I used to live down in Carolina and we would be walking home from school.
[time=2698] There would be turtles everywhere, and all of a sudden you would be walking along and there would be a fence post, barbed wire fence, and then just a post sticking out of the ground about it, and there is a turtle sitting on top of it."
[time=2710] Poor turtle sitting on his shell and his feet are in the air. They can't do anything.
[time=2715] Billy Graham said, "That turtle didn't climb up that post." What happened is some ordinary little guy walked by and said, "A turtle sat the turtle right up there on the fence post,
[time=2725] and the turtle is just out there swimming in the air." Billy Graham said, "I'm a turtle on a fence post. I don't deserve whatever leadership I have.
[time=2733] I'm walking through life and God said, "I'm going to pick you up and I'm going to stick you in this high position."
[time=2739] That's what a leader is. Not somebody who climbs the ladder like a corporate executive.
[time=2747] Not somebody who advances themselves by making all the right.
[time=2751] It's somebody that God says, "I want you and I'll pick you up and I'll put you there, and when I'm done with you,
[time=2758] I'll move you somewhere else." The psalmist put it this way, "Promotion doesn't come from the east.
[time=2764] I've got to think my direction from the east or from the rest, but God lifts one up and puts another one down."
[time=2773] Paul is writing and he identifies himself as one with authority to write.
[time=2779] He was writing with the inspiration of God. He was writing with inerrancy and authority.
[time=2784] That is something that I do not have. Nobody else has it in this church. Nobody else has that today.
[time=2791] The gift of apostleship is gone. Paul is not only an apostle, he describes himself a second way.
[time=2798] Not here, but at the end of the book, turn to chapter 4, verse 10 for just a moment.
[time=2803] Chapter 4, verse 10, he says, "My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends you his greeting, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas."
[time=2816] "My fellow prisoner," verse 18, "I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, remember my chains."
[time=2828] Paul is not only writing as an apostle of Christ, but he is writing as a prisoner for Christ.
[time=2835] Now, it's a matter of study, but pretty solid conjecture that he's writing from a Roman prison.
[time=2843] Paul was imprisoned often. He was imprisoned in Ephesus. He was taken captive at Listra.
[time=2852] He was incarcerated at Caesarea. He was held captive in Jerusalem, and he eventually was in Rome.
[time=2860] We believe he was writing from his Roman prison.
[time=2865] Joining him there is Timothy. Not a prisoner. Probably came to be with Paul to encourage him, to strengthen him,
[time=2873] to suffer with him under house arrest, to be an ambassador with Paul, but Timothy would be included.
[time=2884] Timothy is one who is not described here other than as brother. What a term though.
[time=2892] We talk in that same language today within our churches. We call one another brother or sister.
[time=2899] But you know, we are the Church of Prosperity.
[time=2903] And the Church of Prosperity does not know the bonding that the Church of Persecution knows.
[time=2910] You see, in our culture, we're Christians, and that's great. We're evangelicals. That's marvelous.
[time=2920] Society approves of that as a whole. But in these days, they were persecuted.
[time=2927] And when you went through persecution with another man or woman, you became family.
[time=2934] You were bonded. I'm not praying for persecution, but I do pray that we'll become bonded together as family.
[time=2942] This is Timothy, a brother. He's with me here. We're sharing in this out of fidelity, my partner.
[time=2950] Who was Timothy? We don't know how Timothy came to Christ, but I think Paul led him to Christ on his first missionary journey.
[time=2958] Why do I think that? Because repeatedly, Paul refers to Timothy as my son in the faith.
[time=2963] 1 Timothy 1 to Timothy, my son in the faith. 2 Timothy 2 1, but thou my son, the things that thou's learned of me, my son.
[time=2975] I believe Paul was his spiritual parent. The next thing we know, Paul comes on his second missionary journey, meets up with Timothy.
[time=2983] And Timothy is a believer already and joins up with him and they become companions on the second and third missionary journey, and now even in prison, partners in ministry.
[time=2997] Now Paul changes from who's writing it to whom he is writing. It says to the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae.
[time=3008] "Timothy is a brother, and you are my brothers." Now that was an very inclusive gesture of Paul. He had never seen these people.
[time=3017] How do I know that? He says so. In chapter 1 verse 7, he says that he's not been there. He doesn't know them. How did they come to Christ? A paphorous.
[time=3027] When Paul was on one of his missionary journeys, he stayed in Ephesus for an extended period of time.
[time=3034] And from now to Ephesus, there were church planning teams that were sent out into the outer cities, one like Harryopolis, one like Laodicea, and this one called Colossae.
[time=3046] Out of Ephesus was sent a man by the name of a paphorous, and he was sent out, and the church was started, and now years later it's strong.
[time=3058] You see, it's always been God's strategy for churches to send out and to start new churches.
[time=3064] That's why it's so important that we establish this church, not only here, strong, but we are sending teams, did you make the plant churches there?
[time=3074] The less variances make it to France, the planet church there, that we finance at Dave and Eve's southwell in Portugal to plant 20 churches in 20 years.
[time=3083] That's how this church was started, because the city of Ephesus had a vision and they would send out their apaphrases in their Timothy's, and they would start a new church.
[time=3097] But Paul would say of those people, though he'd never seen them, they are brothers, and he describes these brothers with two terms, holy and faithful.
[time=3106] You mean there's finally a holy church, a perfect church? No.
[time=3110] These people were holy in that God had washed them, cleaned them up, and positionally they were holy.
[time=3119] Functionally they had to work on it. Were they faithful? Sure they were faithful, always no, but they were positioned in the faithful and they were learning to live that.
[time=3133] You know there's great psychology in Paul's mind, because if you tell people what they are often enough, then they usually live up to what you've told them.
[time=3143] I've shared with you before that I failed the third grade, I failed because of a reading deficiency.
[time=3149] I had a very technical problem. It wasn't dyslexia, our learning disability, it was too much TV.
[time=3156] I went to a reading specialist, I had all these tests, and they came out and they gave my parents the worst news.
[time=3165] Mr. and Mrs. Hawks, your son has a terrible problem reading because he has the attention span, the length of an ant.
[time=3174] Does he watch TV much? He lives there, they responded.
[time=3181] And you know that that teacher had the audacity to cut me down to an hour of TV a day.
[time=3188] I mean you talk about cold turkey withdrawals, I was in bad shape.
[time=3194] But you know I failed that year, I've heard it so often that I don't read well, I can't read well, I believe that I couldn't read well.
[time=3203] You know I'm now a sixth grader and I go to a church camp, I didn't like this church camp.
[time=3207] I didn't like this church camp because they sat around a circle and you had to read.
[time=3212] I'm a sixth grade going into seventh grade, they're reading Jesus' Sermon on the mountain, here's what I read when it came to me.
[time=3219] If anyone turns to you as right creek, turn also to him, you're left creek.
[time=3224] They laughed, I mean no one I read, it made sense to me.
[time=3230] You know I had a teacher in the seventh grade.
[time=3233] That guy said, Rick you're really bright, I got this guy fooled.
[time=3238] You know that guy kept encouraging me that I could read and by the time that year was done, just because that guy said it, my grades went up.
[time=3247] And I can read, let me read Colossians 1-1 for you.
[time=3253] Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God.
[time=3257] But you know what somebody had to come into my life and say you can read, let me give it to you more humorously.
[time=3264] A friend told me that they did this to a guy at work.
[time=3268] One guy went up to him and I don't know if the guy's name will call him Fred.
[time=3271] He said, Fred you don't look so well, you doing okay today?
[time=3274] No, I feel great, okay.
[time=3276] Now later another guy went up and said, Fred are you doing all right, you don't look so good.
[time=3279] I think I'm okay.
[time=3282] Later another guy came up to him and said, Fred are you all right?
[time=3285] I don't feel so good.
[time=3287] He went home sick at lunchtime.
[time=3291] The bottom line is this.
[time=3294] If we're told we are something long enough, we then begin to live that way.
[time=3302] And beloved, don't ever forget God said you're holy.
[time=3306] You belong to me.
[time=3309] You're faithful and you belong to me, be faithful to me.
[time=3315] I think Paul told them that so we'd read it.
[time=3318] I'm holy, I need to live that way.
[time=3321] I'm faithful.
[time=3322] I need to be found that way.
[time=3325] This isn't generic postcards.
[time=3327] This is a challenge to a church to be found faithful and holy to Christ.
[time=3334] These people are given two other descriptions.
[time=3336] One, they're at Colossae.
[time=3338] That's a city.
[time=3339] You find Turkey.
[time=3340] You find the western coast of Turkey.
[time=3342] You move inland about a half a day journey and you found Colossae.
[time=3347] That's how the book got its name, Colossians.
[time=3350] In the New Testament, there are 27 books.
[time=3353] 22 of them take their name from either the author or the recipient.
[time=3358] The only exception are Acts and Revelation.
[time=3362] All of the other books take their name from either the author, Matthew Mark Luke, John 1st 2nd 3rd, John 1st and 2nd Peter, James Jude.
[time=3371] All of the rest of them take their names from the recipients.
[time=3375] Colossians, Philippians, Philemon.
[time=3379] The ones that have the names of the authors were other apostles or leaders.
[time=3387] The ones that have the name of the recipients all came from Paul.
[time=3393] This letter is called Colossians because it was Paul's letter to the church of Colossae.
[time=3399] But more than just being there physically, he describes them as the ones who are in Christ.
[time=3406] You see his believers were always living in two spheres simultaneously.
[time=3410] One is our physical sphere.
[time=3412] My sphere is Fort Wayne so is yours except for a few guests visiting today.
[time=3416] But regardless of where we're at physically, spiritually, we're to be walking in Christ.
[time=3423] In your neighborhood, in Christ, in your office, in Christ.
[time=3428] At your recreation, we're always in Christ.
[time=3432] Now he sends these two words of greetings, grace and peace.
[time=3436] Common, yes, general, yes, generic, no way.
[time=3442] These are Paul's favorite words, but they are very intense collective words.
[time=3448] When he says grace, it's like picturing every blessing that God has spiritually, materially,
[time=3455] and saying, "I wish it on you." God's blessed being on you.
[time=3462] The word peace, often Hebrew, Shalom, peace.
[time=3466] It refers to more than a need for peace on our violent streets, our peace in Nicaragua, our peace in the Middle East, talks about a personal peace and a satisfaction that's within.
[time=3479] The theme of the book is the supremacy of Christ.
[time=3483] The book divides neatly in half.
[time=3485] Two chapters talk about the supremacy of Christ.
[time=3488] Two chapters talk about submission to Christ.
[time=3491] For you see, if you believe what the Bible says about Christ, then you will behave the way the Bible says we should if we are in Christ.
[time=3500] Paul's writing, giving us a good view from a bad place prison, saying finish the race.
[time=3509] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir,
[time=3527] our handbell choir, and soloist, Joni King.
[time=3530] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3533] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3540] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3542] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3549] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3553] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3557] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed this prayer today, would you write to us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3566] And when you write to us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
