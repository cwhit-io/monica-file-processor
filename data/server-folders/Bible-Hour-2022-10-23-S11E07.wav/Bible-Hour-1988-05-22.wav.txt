[time=60] I remember one Christmas in particular when Adam was probably about two maybe three years old.
[time=67] We had bought him a large gift, probably a little bit more expensive than we should have purchased.
[time=73] He opened it up with the light, looked at it, said "Thanks Mom, push to the side and spend the rest of Christmas morning playing with the box."
[time=82] If you've got children, you've probably gone through the same experience.
[time=87] And I wonder if God isn't a little bit frustrated with us.
[time=91] He gives to us a box, fills it with gifts like eternal life, an abundant life, peace and forgiveness.
[time=100] And we say "Thanks God, push it aside and then spend our life playing with the box."
[time=106] [MUSIC]
[time=116] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoss.
[time=119] Thank you for joining us.
[time=120] Rick's message today is entitled "Priorities in Praying" and is taken from the Book of Colossians.
[time=126] Whether you are a parent or not, I'm sure you can picture a little child pushing his present aside to play only with the box in which it came.
[time=133] In Paul's opening words in the Book of Colossians, he bursts forth in prayer, thanking God for his spiritual blessing.
[time=140] He gets beyond the box.
[time=142] He looks inside of life and thanks God for release from sin, restoration of fellowship with God, and for fruitful Christian living.
[time=150] Today's message carries the truth, "Priorities in Praying."
[time=156] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Colossians chapter 1.
[time=160] Rick's text is taken from verses 3 through 14.
[time=164] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=173] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=181] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=185] We want to see Jesus.
[time=193] The prayer of our heart this morning is that as we meet together, God would open our eyes and our ears and we would see Jesus.
[time=207] No, we don't expect to see an image, we don't expect to have some type of visualization, but in our spirit through our opened eyes and our open ears that God would speak to us this morning.
[time=219] And we would see the Lord Jesus Christ for who he is and what he's done for us.
[time=225] Thank you for worshiping with us this morning.
[time=227] We're delighted that you're here in this place that we can lift up our voices of praise together.
[time=233] We're thankful for our friends who join us by way of television and hope that this morning that you see Jesus Christ lifted up and exalted.
[time=242] I hope that you'll not only enjoy, but you'll find great worship in the praise that our choir brings to the name of our Savior, the Lord Jesus.

[time=528] (applause)
[time=536] We enjoy as a choir to sing songs that match the power of music with the words and the majesty and strength of the Lord.
[time=544] Faith is the victory that overcomes the world, Him number 418.
[time=548] We're going to sing the first, second, and fourth dances together, Him number 418.
[time=567] And can't along the fields of life be placed in soldiers' eyes
[time=573] and thus the battle where the man shall bear the glowing stars
[time=579] against the golden nails we long let all our spring be known.
[time=585] Faith is the victory we know that overcomes the world.
[time=593] Faith is the victory.
[time=600] Oh glorious victory that overcomes the world.
[time=608] Faith is the glory that overcomes the world.
[time=637] Faith is the victory.
[time=641] Oh glorious victory that overcomes the world.
[time=649] Faith is the victory that overcomes the world.
[time=2315] Because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the saints.
[time=2324] The faith and love that springs from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven
[time=2330] and that you have already heard about in the word of truth the gospel that has come to you.
[time=2338] All over the world this gospel is producing fruit and growing just as it's been doing among
[time=2347] you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth.
[time=2354] You learned it from a paphorus our dear fellow servant who is a faithful minister of Christ
[time=2361] on our behalf and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
[time=2370] For this reason since the day we heard about you we have not stopped praying for you
[time=2378] and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[time=2387] And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please Him in every way
[time=2395] bearing fruit in every good work.
[time=2399] Growing in the knowledge of God being strengthened with all power according to His glorious mind
[time=2406] so that you may have great endurance and patience and joyfully giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints
[time=2419] in the kingdom of light for He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the
[time=2428] kingdom of the Son He loves in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins.
[time=2440] Well here is Paul thinking of a group of people called Colossians and as he thinks of them he's immediately prompted to pray for them.
[time=2450] There are two themes in Paul's praying if you'll notice in verse 3 he says we pray for you giving thanks
[time=2457] and then in verse 9 he again says we haven't stopped praying for you so that and there are two different modes of praying here.
[time=2465] First he's praying giving thanks for them and then he's praying giving in our phraseology
[time=2472] intercession for them.
[time=2474] Someone who is praying a prayer of intercession is someone who says I see you and I see God
[time=2481] and I'm praying it's kind of in between you and God I'm praying for you.
[time=2485] He's interceding just as you and I might pray one for another.
[time=2492] First let's look at the reason why Paul was so thankful when he prayed.
[time=2496] I find three of them.
[time=2498] First of all Paul said that he was thankful when he prayed for the experience of the Colossians.
[time=2504] Verse 3 we always thank God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you.
[time=2511] Why are we so thankful because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus
[time=2517] and the love you have for all the saints the faith and love that springs from the hope
[time=2523] that is stored up for you in heaven.
[time=2527] Now Paul had never been to this city he had not spoken in this church he had never greeted
[time=2533] these people he doesn't know them but he's heard about them hasn't been there but what they're like has made way to Paul and he now hears about them.
[time=2544] Have you ever been in this experience I've been there often or somehow the subject of church comes up with someone who's not from our church and they say well what church are you from and you say well I'm from Black Hawk Baptist Church and they say oh I've heard about that church.
[time=2565] I don't know what you do but I swallow hard and I say really
[time=2573] what have you heard about our church.
[time=2579] You never know what side of the issue they may fall on they may have heard and they may have heard what you and I think oh those are good things.
[time=2588] I may have heard about that church the thing I heard about that squirrely little curly-haired pastor where did you get him and what are they going to say or maybe I heard about that church and I did business with a guy from that church and that what are they going to say when they've heard about our church.
[time=2606] That's what's happening to the church of Colossae.
[time=2610] Somebody's heard about them what have they heard.
[time=2614] You know I'm so thankful for them of their testimony and I hope that when somebody says to you or to me I've heard about your church they might say the same thing that was spoken of of this church of Colossae.
[time=2629] They've been heard of three things.
[time=2633] One we've heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2638] Now that is far more unique in this day than in our day.
[time=2643] For you see today our society has been Christianized.
[time=2647] That does not mean that all of society are Christians.
[time=2650] It doesn't mean that any dimension that we're following Christ as a social movement
[time=2656] but there are churches everywhere and most people who are not Jewish, Muslim or atheist if they're Americans they view themselves to be Christians.
[time=2667] But in this day Jesus Christ was news and there were not churches in every city
[time=2676] if there was a city that a church that was unique and if a city had a church it probably had a church not 300 churches.
[time=2686] And so these people were known because they identified with Jesus Christ.
[time=2692] They had faith in Him.
[time=2694] That can still be relevant today.
[time=2697] That is people look at your life and as they look at my life we are known by the unique commitment we have to Christ.
[time=2705] Maybe everybody in your office believes that they're Christians because they're not something else but you can be unique.
[time=2712] By your walk that you reflect you've got a faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2717] These people also were heard of because they had love one for another.
[time=2722] It says love they had for all of the saints, for everyone who was a believer in Christ.
[time=2727] There was a unique mark that they loved each other.
[time=2732] Jesus said to His disciples, "By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, that you love one another."
[time=2743] When Tacitus would write his history from the Roman standpoint, from the standpoint of an outsider
[time=2750] he would note that these Christians are unique but they love each other.
[time=2758] That's what the secular watching world knew of this church that they loved each other.
[time=2768] Oh, I've heard of Blackhawk.
[time=2772] Have they heard of our faith in Jesus Christ?
[time=2776] Have they said, "Oh, they love each other." Then this faith for in Christ this love for the saints he says springs from the hope that's within you.
[time=2791] It's been called the three Christian virtues, faith, hope and love.
[time=2797] As Paul ends 1 Corinthians 13 he said, "Now abides these three, faith, hope and love and the greatest of these is love."
[time=2806] Now those three virtues are repeated in the testimony of this church.
[time=2811] They had faith in Christ, they had love for one another and that's sprang from a hope.
[time=2818] You see, as we make decisions in our life today, we make decisions based upon what is either in our immediate best interest
[time=2828] or what is in our ultimate best interest.
[time=2833] Paul says the faith and the love that you have is springing forth out of the hope that you have stored up in heaven.
[time=2842] To me what he's saying is you have lived your life full of faith full of love because you have made your decisions based upon heaven
[time=2853] what's ultimately in your best interest.
[time=2856] You know every day in life you and I fight the battle the immediate versus the ultimate.
[time=2863] As you walk through a store there's an immediate desire.
[time=2866] I'll take one of those and I'll take one of those and I'll take three of those.
[time=2870] Oh, those look good.
[time=2871] Immediate desire, the waistline doesn't need it.
[time=2875] The checkbook sure doesn't need to be good again but immediate desire says take it.
[time=2880] The best interest said what I really should do is go out of the store and go home and jog instead of eating this for lunch.
[time=2887] That's what's ultimately my best.
[time=2890] Life is a constant tension between that which is immediate and that which is ultimate.
[time=2895] Paul said your testimony is that you live your life with an ultimate perspective of the hope that's in heaven.
[time=2904] You had the privilege two weeks ago of hearing Ken Nichols as he spoke from our church.
[time=2909] While he was here he began a ministry called the Alive Counseling Center.
[time=2914] He took that little word alive and it's five letters and he made an acrostic out of that that went like this.
[time=2921] Always living in view of eternity.
[time=2925] That's how these people lived in view of eternity and it gave them a steadfast hope.
[time=2931] It gave them a force that drove them to have faith in Christ and a love one for another.
[time=2937] So Paul says I'm thankful today.
[time=2939] I'm thankful for the testimony of this church.
[time=2943] I hope that one were heard of as a body of people and somebody says oh I've heard of your church.
[time=2950] Even if it's positive I hope it's not.
[time=2952] Oh I've heard of your church.
[time=2953] You've got this big programmer.
[time=2955] You've got that big building.
[time=2957] Those are things that happen along the way.
[time=2960] Buildings and budgets those happen along the way as a tool to demonstrate faith, hope and love for which we should be known.
[time=2970] Secondly Paul said I'm thankful not only for the experience of your church but I'm thankful for the expansion of the gospel.
[time=2979] In verses five and six he says that powerful gospel that has changed your life is changing lives around the world.
[time=2988] Did you know that Thomas who we call the doubter made it all the way to India and the gospel within the lifetime of the apostles went to India and beyond?
[time=2997] Do you know the gospel and the lifetimes of the apostles went across the Mediterranean Sea and Spain for sure and maybe France and England?
[time=3007] It was powerful and it's powerful today.
[time=3010] That's why we rejoice when we hear from Ken and Alice Cole that heritage Baptist church is growing.
[time=3017] It's dynamic while we rejoice with Frank Hartwig when we learn that over a hundred people last month came to Christ in Papua New Guinea.
[time=3026] That's called one of the last uncivilized parts of the world and yet when they hear of Jesus Christ there's a power that they come to Christ.
[time=3037] Thirdly he says I'm thankful for the efforts of a paphorus.
[time=3041] You see there's a logic here.
[time=3043] Paul's thankful for what the Colossians have experienced but they would have never experienced that if it wasn't for the expansion of the gospel.
[time=3051] But that powerful gospel would have never made it to Colossi if one man by the name of the paphorus didn't put forth the effort.
[time=3059] At paphorus he calls two things he calls my fellow servant and our faithful minister.
[time=3066] Now when you and I hear the word minister we think of a personal occupation.
[time=3071] That's not the biblical concept.
[time=3073] A minister is anyone whether they're a plumber, nurse, doctor, lawyer, whatever their occupation is who imparts God's gifts to others.
[time=3086] God's gift of caring, God's gift of mercy, God's gift of salvation.
[time=3091] And here are two concepts put together that the one who is a minister is also the one who is a servant.
[time=3100] And if you're not a servant you'll never be a minister.
[time=3103] Jesus said would you like to be the leader then be the follower?
[time=3106] Would you like to be first and be last?
[time=3109] Whoever would be great among you let him become a slave to all.
[time=3113] A paphorus didn't arrive in Colossians saying hello I am the most high reverend.
[time=3119] Here are my credentials give me an office complex in a building and then I will minister.
[time=3126] He came as a fellow servant and from that perspective he gave ministry.
[time=3135] Now when you come to verse 9 Paul changes he's ended his prayer of thanksgiving and now it's a prayer of intercession.
[time=3142] He's praying for them as we ought to pray one for another.
[time=3145] What should we pray one for another?
[time=3148] Let's take a model from Paul.
[time=3150] Verse 9 for this reason since the day we heard about you we have not stopped praying for you.
[time=3158] Now what does Paul pray for chiefly two things one that we pray for you asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[time=3172] The cheapest thing we ought to pray for in our lives and for one another is not the business will boom not that our health will always improve not that we'll make more money not that things will fall together in this hectic schedule.
[time=3187] I'm not putting that down we can pray for those things but first and foremost we ought to pray for one another that we might have overwhelming fullness of the knowledge of God's will.
[time=3200] Do you ever get so engrossed in a project that your mind does not shut down this past week on Friday I worked more than anything else on a one page budget of related expenses for our new building I wanted to understand that.
[time=3218] And by the time I got done with that I didn't mean to have it memorized but I nearly had it memorized and I went home and I'm still going $477,000 worth of bond reductions $513,000 I couldn't get it out of my mind.
[time=3234] You've had that happen have you ever woke up in the middle of the night and you're humming a song now I don't recognize the tune but the lyrics come back to me.
[time=3243] And you say how did that get in it it's because your mind's been filled with something Paul says I'm praying for you that you become so saturated with the wisdom and the knowledge of God that your mind is full of it.
[time=3257] You ever meet people it seems like they just make all the right moves spiritually solid financially solid their kids pretty good.
[time=3267] How is it they're winning on all fronts it's usually because they're winning at the core of life which is spiritually and Paul said I'm praying that you're filled.
[time=3276] Now why does Paul pray that they're filled second dimension verse 10 he says so that you might walk worthily of the Lord pleasing him in every way.
[time=3286] You see if we are filled with God's knowledge that's not the end goal God didn't give us knowledge his word to increase our knowledge but to transform our lives.
[time=3299] And so good as we're filled with the knowledge of God then we walk according to that insight in that wisdom and that becomes a walk that's worthy of Christ and it pleases him in every way.
[time=3311] Now from verse 10 through 14 he uses four participles to describe a worthy walk would you like to walk worthy of the Lord today here's four things that would please him.
[time=3322] Look if you'll notice at verse 10 we pray this in order that you may walk you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way.
[time=3332] Now my translation's got a colon and that means here's the explanation of that walk one bearing fruit in every good work.
[time=3342] Typically in the Bible fruit speaks of either winning other people to Christ or the character of a Christian here the emphasis is on the character of the Christian.
[time=3351] You will please God if your life produces godly character. Second way you can please God is to not only bear fruit but to be growing it says growing in the knowledge of God.
[time=3366] I have been a believer about about 18 years now and I need to keep growing. It's not a matter of how long you've been a believer the danger is that you've been a believer for so long you've plateaued.
[time=3382] You want to please God keep going keep growing. Third way you can please God is to be strengthened with his might in his power and that also has a goal of the purpose.
[time=3394] It says that you might have patience and endurance. You have patience towards people and we have endurance towards situations and God says be growing be strengthened that you might be patient that you might have endurance.
[time=3411] In the fourth way we can please God is to be thankful. Verse 12 ends giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in inheritance.
[time=3424] Thankfulness pleases God. Here are three things you can give him thanks for. One is listed we can give thanks because he's restored us to a home in heaven and inheritance.
[time=3437] Two he's rescued us from the power of sin and three he's redeemed us redemption is described there is the forgiveness of sin and one is caused by the other.
[time=3447] God redeems us he forgives us that releases us from sin God releases us from sin that restores us to heaven.
[time=3467] We've been sharing with you the inspiring music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Keith and star Brodigam.
[time=3478] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3488] Will you bow and pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father I thank you that you came into this world to die for my sins.
[time=3496] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3500] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and make me a new person.
[time=3506] In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=3511] You prayed that prayer today. Would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
