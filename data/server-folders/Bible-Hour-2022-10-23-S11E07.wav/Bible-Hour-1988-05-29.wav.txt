[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=110] Jesus Christ is present in the life of every believer, but He is prominent only in some of us, and more tragically Christ is preeminent only in a few of us.
[time=126] (dramatic music)
[time=136] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=140] Thank you for joining us.
[time=141] Rick's message today is taken from the book of Colossians and is entitled, Jesus is Lord.
[time=147] Is Christ present in your life?
[time=149] Is He prominent in your life?
[time=154] One of the great paradoxes of life is that Christ Jesus rules this mighty universe, but not the hearts of some of us, the people He has created.
[time=162] Today in our study in Colossians, we will discover why Christ is supreme, Lord of all.
[time=168] The most important question is, is He your Lord?
[time=172] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Colossians chapter 1.
[time=176] We'll be looking at verses 15 through 23.
[time=179] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=183] Other special music includes a solo from Lynn Rowell, a song from the Men's Singers Quartet, and an instrumental solo from Scott Schindler.
[time=196] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of a Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort White and Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=203] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=208] Now here's Rick.
[time=209] Welcome you here this morning to worship, to praise God through the attention that we give to the Scriptures, through the songs that we hear, and through the songs that we can sing together.
[time=220] The very focal point of our meeting is to worship the Lord Jesus Christ and to know that He's not only present in our lives, but to allow Him to be more than prominent to make Him preeminent in each one of our hearts.
[time=234] We're so thankful that you've come here to worship Him with us.
[time=238] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=244] We trust that God will use our time together to magnify the name of Christ and to worship Him.
[time=258] [MUSIC - 332 seconds]
[time=630] And we say amen to them.
[time=632] Let's listen now to more music as Lynn Roll comes to minister to us in song.
[time=637] May the Lord bless her and you as she sings for us.
