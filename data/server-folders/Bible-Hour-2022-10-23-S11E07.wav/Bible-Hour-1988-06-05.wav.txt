[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=113] - Church financing is a peculiar subject.
[time=117] Everybody thinks that somebody ought to do something.
[time=121] But somebody thinks it's everybody's job.
[time=125] But somebody realized that anybody could do it.
[time=128] As it turned out, everybody, somebody, and anybody didn't.
[time=133] And the only body who did was nobody.
[time=137] (dramatic music)
[time=146] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoffs.
[time=149] Thank you for joining us.
[time=151] Rick's message today is taken from 1 Corinthians chapter 16 and is entitled "Integrity with Finances." Churches and ministries all survive by the commitment of the bodies who make the body.
[time=163] Every church or ministry of any kind has somebody, anybody, everybody, and nobody wishing another body would come along and pick up the load.
[time=172] Today we will take a refreshing look at God's simple no gimmick plan for church finances.
[time=177] So everybody listening should make sure that somebody finds 1 Corinthians chapter 16 in their Bibles.
[time=183] Make sure to invite anybody to join us.
[time=186] Nobody should miss today's lesson on the Bible Hour.
[time=189] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=194] Other special music includes a song from celebration.
[time=199] And Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe.
[time=203] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=211] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=215] Now, here's Rick.
[time=218] - It is a joy to welcome you here on this Sunday morning
[time=231] that we can come together and lift our voices and praise the Lord.
[time=235] We're delighted that you've come here that we can together see our faces, see the expressions, hear our voices, shake hands, and be in fellowship.
[time=246] Thanks for worshiping here at Black Hawk with us.
[time=249] We also wanna welcome our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=252] We trust that God will use this hour in each of our lives to give us a sense of joy in knowing Christ.
[time=260] Our choir is singing an exciting song for us today.
[time=263] Kevin will be singing a solo.
[time=265] The orchestra is playing along.
[time=267] It's a song that speaks about God's goodness and expecting God's blessing in our life.
[time=273] The song's entitled, "Something Great." (upbeat music)
[time=282] [MUSIC - 87 seconds]
[time=374] when your soul is rich in Jesus, you're going to prosper in every way. He has such great
[time=381] provision for everyone every day. Now there's one more thing you've asked for that you haven't
[time=389] yet received. Just take this little moment and sing this song with me. Something greater.
[time=401] Something greater. Something greater. Something greater. Something greater.
[time=423] Something greater. Something greater. Something greater. Something greater. Yes, I'm ready for something
[time=430] greater from the Lord. God is so good to us. We appreciate His love to us and yet while we were
[time=451] yet sinners, even He died for us to give us eternal life. To God be the glory, great things
[time=457] He hath done. Him number 52. Him number 52. Join with the choir and orchestra singing heartily,
[time=463] the praise to the Lord, singing all three verses together.
[time=493] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people rejoice.
[time=519] Lord, to the Father, to Jesus the Son, and dear in the glory, great things He hath done.
[time=535] Praise the Lord. Lord, to the Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the
[time=553] Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the
[time=599] Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the Father, to the Father.
[time=628] To the Father, to Jesus the Son, and dear in the glory, great things He hath done.
[time=650] In our Christian world, we celebrate one day in the spring of the year that reminds us
[time=657] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=660] However, in our church, because we know Jesus is Savior, every day is a resurrection Sunday.
[time=666] Today we listen as the celebration sings for us Christ the Lord is risen today, Hallelujah.
[time=687] Christ the Lord is risen today, sons of men and angels say, Raise your joys and try
[time=698] us high, Sing ye heavens and earth reply, Sing ye heavens and earth reply, loves redeeming
[time=714] for this Him Christ, Christ is open paradise, Christ is open paradise, Christ the Lord is
[time=727] risen today, Hallelujah, sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=744] You live again our glorious King, where our death is now thy speed, thine was he of the
[time=754] name, where thy victory, O grave, where thy victory, O grave, O grave, O grave, O joy,
[time=767] O grave, O grave, O grave, O grave, O grave, O grave, O grave, O grave, O grave, O grave
[time=781] today, Hallelujah, sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is
[time=795] risen today, Hallelujah, sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=811] Hallelujah, sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
[time=824] Hallelujah, sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is
[time=857] risen today, Hallelujah, sons of men and angels say, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
[time=872] Christ the Lord is risen.
[time=880] Hello and thank you for joining us again here today on the Bible Hour. Pete I hope that
[time=886] you've had as good a weekend as I've had. It's been a great weekend Rick. We took a little bit of time off on Friday and got away from Fort Wayne with our family. We haven't done that for some time. Just took a day away and it was really refreshing for us. Good for you and welcome back. Today we're going to do something that's a bit unusual for us here on the Bible Hour as a part of our message time. We'll certainly be studying the Scripture and as you were encouraged earlier, you could open your Bible now to 1 Corinthians chapter 16. But today we're going to talk to our church family and to you friends who join us by way of television about biblical principles for church financing. As I don't
[time=925] need to tell you, you already know these are days of alarming concern in the area of church
[time=931] ministry and financial integrity. We want today to look at the scriptures and see what they teach us and then talk about this ministry and what needs do we have. If you're a regular
[time=943] viewer of the Bible Hour, you know that we don't often talk about money and particularly our needs. Today will be an exception to that and we hope one that you'll find not only palatable but pleasing. But before we go on with the morning service and our message,
[time=958] we have several things coming up to share with you that we hope you'll be able to participate in with us, particularly the patriotic panorama. Rick, the patriotic panorama is coming up
[time=968] July 3. We're doing something a little bit differently this year. We're having a picnic here for our church family and then the program will begin at 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon July
[time=979] 3 behind our new worship center, Rick. We're going to be out on the grounds there. We have a grassy area where we will be performing with our sanctuary choir and a guest group
[time=990] of musicians called the King's Brass. They're a great group of musicians that will really
[time=996] bless our hearts and bring a blanket, bring a chair and come and join us for that great
[time=1002] time of patriotic music. Well, we're looking forward to that and do hope that you can join us. Again, the date is Sunday, July 3. We'll be having a picnic outside on the lawn and
[time=1014] if you would like details about that, you can simply call the church office. But without a call, you can just come to the musical concert at 4 o'clock. Also, we want to invite you
[time=1025] to join us for this year's Summer Bible Conference. Each year, we have some of the best of speakers
[time=1031] and films to challenge us and to help us grow in our Christian faith. These next two Wednesday nights will have a film entitled Twice Pardon and that's something of a special
[time=1042] feature here. Rick, we've already had a great beginning of our Summer Bible Conference and the film series Twice Pardon is going to be excellent with Harold Morris and James Dobson.
[time=1052] So we hope that you'll set those nights of Wednesday evening aside and join us here at Blackhawk at 7 o'clock. Before we go back to our morning worship service, we do have an excellent pamphlet to share with you. This has been an unusual week here for us at Blackhawk.
[time=1068] This past week, we've had the funeral of three different loved ones. A little girl, Sarah Wagner was taken in a car accident. Another young man, Stephen Dell, was taken in a separate
[time=1079] automobile accident. And then a Bible, our viewer, Cortis Middleton, passed away. All
[time=1085] of these people and each of us are going through a difficult time in our life. If not today,
[time=1092] someday. Life gets a hold of us and it begins to squeeze us and it begins to squeeze our
[time=1098] comfort zone. How will you respond? What could you learn today that would help you? Well, we have a booklet with that title. When your comfort zone gets squeezed and we'd love to send you a copy, if you would simply write for it today. You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour. 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana. The zip code is 46815.
[time=1122] Once again, that's the Bible Hour. 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana. 46815. We do
[time=1131] hope that you'll write today and we'll send you a copy of your booklet. We'd love to hear from you.
[time=1165] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1309] Thanks, Kevin and Denise. There is a joy in our life that music can express for us and
[time=1315] occasionally provoke in us. If you didn't have some joy to express when you came in, I hope that provoked a little in you. We're delighted that we can come together and rejoice
[time=1325] in the Lord's goodness to us. A week from now, 31 of us will be on our way to Jamaica.
[time=1332] There will spend 14 days primarily doing tent meetings, door-to-door evangelism and medical
[time=1339] clinics to share the gospel of Jesus Christ there in the city of Mondeville. I'd like to ask those who are here of those 31 to come up now and stand on the steps and ask you to be praying for them. We're taking just a moment to commission them, asking God's
[time=1355] direction and blessing on their lives. And as they're here, they're here for you to be praying for them, not only at this moment but during the weeks of June the 12th through June the 24th. I'm going to ask Jim Hindolf, he would come and lead us in prayer, asking
[time=1371] God's blessing on our Jamaica 88 team.
[time=1377] Let's pray. Father, as I look around at the people and the families represented here this
[time=1384] morning, we know that there are literally hundreds of hours that have been invested in this project already along with the two weeks that they'll be gone. And we do pray for this team, pray that they would have the strength and the wisdom to handle the
[time=1400] situations that they'll be in, that through their visits that they will help to evangelize
[time=1407] the country of Jamaica. We thank you for their willingness to volunteer these couple weeks.
[time=1414] We pray for traveling mercies for them that you would take them down and bring them back safely, keep them safely while they're there. We also think of the families that may be
[time=1423] back here while some of them are gone. And pray for those families also that they would have a good time while they're here. Encourage them all so father and we just pray that the
[time=1434] country of Jamaica and everybody that the team comes in contact with would be forever
[time=1440] remembering the team here and remembering Christ and that many people would come to know him through their visit. Thank you that you're sending these people. We just thank you that when they come back that they may even be further encouraged to greatly expand their evangelism here in the Fort Wayne area. Thank you father and Jesus name. Amen.
[time=1463] Thank you and you all may be seated and I would ask again that you pray for us as we go as an extension of this church. Mandeville is the third largest city in Jamaica. It is
[time=1475] a very central city. It is far away from anything that you think of when you think of Jamaica.
[time=1482] There are no beaches. There are no motels where tourists flock to. It is primarily a industrial
[time=1489] city of about 40,000 people in a very mountainous rural area. The people there are extremely poor.
[time=1498] There are some who have means about them but the average person lives off of root crops.
[time=1505] They plant things like squash. They plant things like potatoes and carrots. But the main thing
[time=1511] that they grow is a plant that has a big root and they eat the root of that plant. We were
[time=1517] standing in front of Calvary Baptist Church which is really just an old house that's used
[time=1523] by over a hundred people from church and we asked the pastor David Granson, "What could we do to help their church?" We thought that we might be able to send literature and supplies.
[time=1534] We might be able to send medical supplies. Perhaps help financially. He said, "The thing you could do the most is could you come and help us when souls did Jesus Christ?" That's
[time=1545] the heartbeat of those people. They want to serve and to share the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1552] We had asked you to pray for them. Before we study the scriptures today, I'd like to ask you to bow that we could pray as a family for this church as well. Father, we're thankful
[time=1562] for the extraordinary blessing that you have poured out on us that we can have what we
[time=1568] have here and be a part of a world concept of sharing missions. We thank you for the
[time=1574] opportunities in Jamaica. We pray for the ballasts and coals who are each facing some
[time=1580] critical times in Manila. We pray for the Southwells as they labor in Portugal, in Don Fanning
[time=1587] and Argentina, and around the globe you've given us opportunities to be partners and
[time=1593] we are thankful. We pray for this body that we might grow in our fervent commitment to
[time=1599] sharing Christ. We pray today for your strength in witness and in living. We pray for those
[time=1608] who today are suffering greatly because of the loss of loved ones. We pray today for
[time=1614] Don Sealy and the loss of his mother, particularly for Paul and Dorothy Dell and the loss of their
[time=1621] son Steve this week, and for David, his brother, that you would comfort him. We pray for little
[time=1629] Sarah's parents and grandparents as she is gone and they are left. Oh God, we ask you
[time=1636] to comfort them. We pray today for those who are facing emotional hurts, for a family whose
[time=1643] daughter is walking in disobedience and considering a decision that would further, further stray
[time=1650] from you. God, we pray today for Julie because she battles cancer pregnant at the same time.
[time=1659] You'd give her doctor's wisdom and you would protect her and the child she's carrying.
[time=1664] Father, we pray that you would put within our hearts an urgency about life that we would
[time=1670] in your words redeem the time to serve you. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1679] If you have your Bible, please open it to 1 Corinthians chapter 16. We're departing
[time=1685] from our study of Colossians today for what I hope is a timely and well-given and well-received
[time=1692] theme that we need to address. I've heard it said and it's true that a church has to
[time=1702] have three things to keep it going and growing. Those three things are message, momentum,
[time=1709] and morale. God has blessed us in an extraordinary way with an abundance of each. Message, we
[time=1717] have the timeless, inerrant Word of God that is living, it is powerful, and it changes
[time=1724] lives today. Just to look out in this audience and to see people whose lives have been dramatically
[time=1732] changed. A young man who three months ago was and that addicted to cocaine has been restored
[time=1740] to the Lord and His family. A family that was on the verge of collapse or holding hands
[time=1747] as they walked into the building today. Individuals whose life had no purpose have been turned
[time=1753] around by God, Spirit, working through His timeless Word. We've got a message. God's
[time=1763] given us momentum. Our church has been blessed with growth. More people here this year than
[time=1770] last, more last than the year before, but not only growth in numbers, but people willing to serve, people sharing their faith, people wanting to go tell the country of Jamaica
[time=1781] about Christ and morale. You're always so positive, always so encouraging. God's blessed
[time=1789] us in some extraordinary ways. But yet even with a good message, great momentum and excellent
[time=1796] morale, there are always a few kinks in the armor. And today we need to talk in a very
[time=1802] family way about that. In many ways we're doing exceptional. In some ways we need to
[time=1808] work fast and urgently. As I shared with you in a letter, our church is doing a lot like a report card I brought home in the 10th grade. I got an A I want you to know. It was in gym class, but it still counted as an A. A couple of B's and probably a C and then
[time=1824] one grade in my favorite subject of Latin. Well, I didn't get an A that semester in Latin.
[time=1831] I got just one letter grade below a D, however. They did not give E's for effort. And in
[time=1838] a lot of our lives we're doing exceptional in many ways, but in one area we're really
[time=1844] struggling. And that's the condition that we find ourselves in as a church. I am speaking
[time=1851] about finances and most of you know me and you know that this is not necessarily my least
[time=1858] favorite subject to talk about. It's next to last right before the death of a loved one.
[time=1865] You don't like to hear about money. And so if you're watching by way of television, you may note that we almost never talk about money. And so when we talk about it today,
[time=1876] I hope you'll know that it is important. Many times people cry wolf wolf and create
[time=1882] a crisis. And then when the crisis comes, you've heard wolf wolf so often you ignore
[time=1888] it. I told you this before I share it again because I like this story. Rachel, our eight
[time=1894] year old is a complainer. I mean she has an ache and pain because the wind changed direction.
[time=1901] And I was scolding her and correcting her and so finally we were going to have this real father-daughter chat. So she sat down, I sat down and I went through the story about
[time=1911] the little boy who cried wolf wolf and the men came running but there was no wolf. The
[time=1917] next night he cried wolf wolf and the men came back and there was no wolf and it went on day after day. And then I said Rachel, one day the wolf came. The little boy cried wolf wolf and the men said there's no wolf and they didn't come. And the wolf ate up the sheep and the little boy. Then in a very deductive where I said now Rachel, what do you think the message of that story is? She thought, she looked up and she said, I guess
[time=1941] that means you better come no matter what. So much for my ability as a teacher of children.
[time=1953] But you know we want to guard our words as a church. We don't want to always be saying
[time=1959] wolf wolf, financial problem, our crises over here urgently respond because if you
[time=1966] are like me you'll be going wolf wolf. And so as we take this opportunity I hope you recognize
[time=1974] the uniqueness of our addressing this subject. But rather than us try to manipulate you or
[time=1982] simply to speak of need, I'd rather speak of principle. And God has addressed this so clearly so many times in his word but I've chosen to go back to what I believe is the simplest formula. It bears constant attention in our minds. First Corinthians chapter 16,
[time=1999] the first three verses. Now about the collection for God's people, do what I told the Galatian
[time=2010] churches to do. On the first day of every week each one of you should set aside a sum
[time=2018] of money in keeping with his income, saving it up so that when I come no collections will
[time=2024] have to be made. Then when I arrive I will give letters of introduction to the men you
[time=2031] approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. I'd like you to notice four aspects of Paul's
[time=2039] words here today. The first is a plan. God has a plan for financing ministry. There may
[time=2049] be alternatives that may be supplemental, others may choose to use them but I really
[time=2055] believe this is God's biblical plan that ministry is financed through a collection of the people.
[time=2065] I don't disagree with those who have various fundraising projects. We choose to do that
[time=2071] within our school but not within our church. We believe that there is here a plan that God
[time=2079] said in the Old Testament that the people were to give based upon a tithe and that provided
[time=2085] for ministry. You come to the New Testament, tithing is not the principle that is uniquely taught but it says that there is to be a collection amongst God's people and the pattern is repeated.
[time=2096] Paul said what I want you to do is the same thing that I ask the churches of Galatia to do.
[time=2101] This is a pattern that God's people provide for ministry out of what we would call a love,
[time=2107] out of a burden of heart, out of a priority that says God owns me, he owns all that I am
[time=2115] and I give to him my first and I give to him my best and then we put that into ministry.
[time=2121] But there is with that pattern, that plan of God, there are problems not here in the
[time=2128] text but problems you and I encounter, chiefly one. We don't like collections and there are probably a hundred reasons why we don't like those but let me share with you the
[time=2140] ones I feel are the most common. Reason number one is we don't like collections because we've all seen it and we've all felt it in its abuse. None of us need to be reminded that there are those who
[time=2154] live in million dollar homes who plead for money with great emotion in forever. All of us have
[time=2163] experienced the professional who can turn on his charm and his tears at the drop of a hat
[time=2170] and can provoke feelings of sympathy out of the ignorant and innocent that are undeserved.
[time=2175] All of us here are infuriated when we learn that somebody in the name of ministry has been
[time=2183] conned out of their money by false teachers who say, "If you'll just send me ten dollars,
[time=2189] God says he's going to send back to you a hundred fold like we got some spiritual financial plan.
[time=2195] If you just give to God, look under your pillow tonight because the tooth fairy is going to come to your house." The tragedy is that there are those that believe that. Now my son's five years old
[time=2207] and he knows who the tooth fairy is and when the tooth fairy doesn't visit, he doesn't call the tooth fairy, he says, "Dad." But unfortunately there are those who are so glib of tongue that
[time=2222] they can make God into this tooth fairy and then some innocent, ignorant soul sends what they can afford thinking. They're going to do that and now God's obligated and abuses. There are those who
[time=2235] create a crisis. There are those who are masters at fabricating wolves and trading the wolves in
[time=2242] front of you on Sunday morning or by way of television and suddenly there's urgency you've got to.
[time=2250] One of the men who was very much an integral part of our church had a father who was very much a part of the viewership of our television ministry and the father
[time=2260] said to the son, "I was going to send the Bible or some financial support but then I saw so and so
[time=2267] and he sure needed it more." And we're aware that financing a church and a ministry is often
[time=2275] successful based upon your ability to create crises and all of the different things that happen
[time=2283] give many of us a feeling. I don't like to hear about collection because we identify it with the
[time=2289] abuse. There's a second reason why we don't like this pattern. Though it's God's, a second reason is
[time=2296] often a little more personable. It is selfishness. Even if there were no abuses, even if there
[time=2305] were no misunderstandings, most of the time an offering still hits us right in a sensitive part
[time=2313] of our anatomy, the pocket book. And many times we are resistant to appeals for money because we
[time=2322] don't want God to intrude upon that area of our life. Perhaps it's because it's so measurable.
[time=2329] Somebody can ask you, "How much do you love Jesus?" And you say, "Oh, I love Jesus." How do you measure
[time=2336] that? Kind of intangible. Somebody can say, "How earnestly do you pray?" "Oh, I'm earnest." You
[time=2343] know, I'm waiting to give them earnest. Look about it. How do you measure that? But suddenly,
[time=2349] when you give money, that's it all is measurable. There's a third reason, I think a common one, why
[time=2358] we don't like offerings. And it's simply we're naive. Most of us are naive about how much things
[time=2368] cost and where the money comes from. My father and grandfather have had for 30 some years an
[time=2375] appliance repair business. And I remember my father telling this story over and over again.
[time=2379] A call comes into his shop. A lady's frantic. Her dryer does not work. It won't dry the clothes.
[time=2386] So he or one of the men working there take the truck, they drive out to their home, they get to their home, they check it all out. And my father says he opens up the lint pickup, pulls it out.
[time=2396] There's about this much lint. Now, this is a little aside, ladies. A dryer doesn't dry it, dehumidifies. And if that lint filter is plugged, it can't take the wetter out. So he'd take it out,
[time=2407] he'd empty it, and he'd throw it away, stick it back in, say your dryer works and hand her the bill.
[time=2412] She'd look at that bill and say, you're going to charge me for emptying my lint pickup?
[time=2417] No, ma'am. We never charge for emptying lint pickups. But we do charge for the time it took to
[time=2425] drive out here, the car we had to buy to drive in, the gas that it took, the secretary we had to hire to answer the phone, the insurance we had to carry, the building we had to buy, and the roof we had to head over, the parking lot we had to pave.
[time=2438] You don't think about that. You're going to charge me to empty my lint pickup.
[time=2443] You know, we're a little bit naive. Everything in life cost money. We learned that in a gripping
[time=2450] way yesterday. With no influence of mine, my children have decided they wanted to be on the swim team.
[time=2460] Now, being an old river rat, that appealed to me very greatly. So, Kathy went off to the meeting
[time=2467] and came back and said the kids are signed up, sit down. 25 dollars a piece to join the swim team.
[time=2478] I thought that was reasonable. 25 dollars more a piece to join the diving team.
[time=2484] About 32 dollars a piece for t-shirts and matching swimsuits.
[time=2490] Then you have to go out and find a 25 dollar sponsor to put their name on the back of each
[time=2496] kid's t-shirt. And that's the dues for the swim team for the first half of the summer.
[time=2501] Everything in life cost money. I'm going to go back into swim coaching, but everything in life
[time=2512] costs money. You know, we're naive. We just go through life thinking that, you know, nothing cost,
[time=2519] but it costs a great deal. And ministry costs. Many of us are naive about churches. We think
[time=2526] we come in on Sunday. We have these big buildings. We have 45 missionaries that we support. We have a youth staff. We have a pastor. We have an associate pastor. We have children's ministry.
[time=2535] We have all of these things. And every Monday morning, we go out back to the money tree and we pick off the money and we pay the bills and it's just great. No. God says ministry is provided by
[time=2548] collection. That's the pattern. Now, here's the second aspect of what Paul said, the principles.
[time=2555] I've shared these with you before, but let me stir you up by way of remembrance. In verse two,
[time=2561] Paul gives three principles. Now, if you're convinced, ministry costs money and it's our
[time=2567] responsibility, then what are the principles? How do I go about that process of giving?
[time=2574] Three principles. Principle number one is the principle of responsibility.
[time=2578] Verse two says, "On the first day of every week," notice these next words, "each one of you."
[time=2589] The responsibility belongs to every believer in Christ.
[time=2597] It doesn't here say, "Each one of you who has had a bumper crop in farming, each one of you
[time=2604] who has had a bonanza here in the real estate, each one of you with an earned income above."
[time=2610] No. Each one of us. Now, we're going to talk about proportion in a moment,
[time=2617] but whether we are amongst the more affluent or whether we are amongst the least affluent comes responsibility. It says, "Each one." Many times we collect together and we think that
[time=2632] somebody ought to, but nobody wants to. And the body, family, ends up having a tough time.
[time=2642] Everybody thinks somebody should do it. Somebody thinks anybody could, but anybody,
[time=2649] everybody, and somebody don't. And the only one who does is nobody.
[time=2652] The reality of Scripture is it is everybody's job. This is one assignment that nobody is left
[time=2664] out of. It's a responsibility that God gives to each of us. Principle number two, it's a responsibility
[time=2672] that is to be carried out regularly. It says, "On the first day of the week," why the first day of
[time=2679] the week, "because that's when they met." They didn't meet on Tuesday lunch hour, they met on
[time=2687] Sunday morning. So on the first day of the week, and then notice this every week, that gives to us
[time=2694] the consistency, the regularity of that which we are to do as a responsibility. Now, it says,
[time=2701] "set aside because these people, many of them, got paid daily." Jesus taught in a parable,
[time=2707] there was a man who went out. He hired a man to work for him, and he offered him a sum of money.
[time=2714] Then later in the day, he offered another man the same sum of money, and at the end of the day, he paid them both. Many of these people lived a subsistence type of lifestyle.
[time=2726] And at the end of the day, they were given money. And for many of them, that money would carry them
[time=2732] through tomorrow. But they had to work tomorrow to make it through the next day. And so life was a
[time=2739] matter of daily living. And Paul comes along and says, "Now, as you receive that income,
[time=2745] what do you do? You save it. You set it aside so that on the first opportunity of worship,
[time=2753] there can be a contribution that is made, and it is put aside." The Bible teaches the principle of regular giving, of consistency. One of the worst patterns a
[time=2767] believer can get into is impulse giving. Because what happens is we get all emotional, we respond,
[time=2774] we respond generously, then we look and we say, "I can't do that. Why did I say I'd do that? I can't
[time=2781] live up to that." And then too long goes by that we do nothing, and then we feel guilt and
[time=2788] somebody gives an emotional pill and we go, "Oh, I better do something." And so we just fluctuate
[time=2794] between excess and nothing, excess and nothing on a guilt cycle. We're guilty when we're excess,
[time=2800] because we can't live up to the commitment, then we're guilty because we can't do anything.
[time=2803] The Bible teaches a systematic plan. You know the way you pay for a car, if you can't pay cash,
[time=2811] you pay for it on a consistent payment. How do you buy a house? You make a consistent payment, and the best thing a believer in Christ can do is to determine in their heart to regularly give
[time=2823] to God's work. Does it have to be weekly? No, you may get paid every other week. Maybe that's how,
[time=2829] but a consistency in how you give. But throughout the scriptures it teaches that we are to set aside
[time=2836] that which we give to God first. If you were living in the Old Testament time and you had a farm and
[time=2843] you grew crops, your responsibility would be to give the first fruits to God. If you were in the Old Testament and you didn't grow crops, but on your farm you had animals, you were to give the firstlings, the firstborn to God. There was to be the recognition that God owns all, and so
[time=2860] first I give to Him. I'm not saying you have to do this, but this is an application that has helped
[time=2866] our family. That as we sit down, before we see how much we owe everywhere in America,
[time=2873] we write down the first check is our commitment to the Lord. That's a way of giving to Him first,
[time=2881] because if we pay off everything else, then we sit and think about everything we're going to do the next two weeks and everything we'd like to do, suddenly we want to know if the Lord writes loans.
[time=2890] But the principle of Scripture is you honor the Lord first, care for your obligations secondly,
[time=2898] and then you spend your money discretionary last. Now, Kathy pointed out that's an excellent point.
[time=2905] We live up to it. Then she said, "I wrote out the check to the church first. Did you bring it this morning?" I said, "No." "Did you bring it?" She said, "No." I said, "We can afford to write a lot
[time=2918] more of those checks. We'll bring it tonight." But are we faithful in honoring the Lord
[time=2927] first with the principle of week by week? Not out of emotion, not out of crises,
[time=2933] but week by week. That's the second principle. Third principle is the principle of resources.
[time=2940] God expects us to give and to give regularly, but we give proportionately. Jesus gave this simple
[time=2948] statement and it makes more sense than anything, to whom much is given, much is required.
[time=2955] None of us want to hear a story about a little lady, a widow, living off,
[time=2962] dependent aid from the government, taking that check, endorsing it over to any ministry,
[time=2968] and living without proper food or shoulder or clothing or medical care.
[time=2973] Nobody wants to hear that. If you're here today or watching by way of television,
[time=2982] that is not God's plan. But God's plan is that out of our resources, if we have very little,
[time=2989] then very little is expected. If we have a great deal, then much is expected, to whom much is given, much is required. Let me trace this for you. First of all,
[time=3000] we're getting it out of 16/2 of First Corinthians. Let him keep his, excuse me,
[time=3007] set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income. Leviticus 1430 says this,
[time=3018] "He shall sacrifice a dove or a pigeon as he can afford." As were 2, 69. According to their ability, they gave to the treasury, according to their ability.
[time=3033] Acts 11, 29. Then the disciples each gave as each was able. 2 Corinthians 8, 12. If there is a
[time=3043] willingness, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what one
[time=3050] does not have. Here are three simple principles out of Scripture. Principle number one is this one,
[time=3059] that we give out of God, sensing that it's my responsibility. No matter who I am, it's my
[time=3066] responsibility. Principle number two is we give regularly. Principle number three, it's in proportion
[time=3074] to our resources. Allow me to draw some very simple applications as it relates to our church.
[time=3081] Really, in this area of giving, we're doing marvelously. We are hitting our budget within 92%.
[time=3090] That's great. That would get an A minus or a B plus at any university. But when you're talking
[time=3098] about available funds, after you fall $1,900 behind one week, two weeks, you suddenly get the week
[time=3108] 22 and you're $42,000 behind. And suddenly that begins to be an accumulated deficit that's overwhelming.
[time=3119] So by way of application, we're asking our church family to give. I need to ask you to do two things.
[time=3126] The first is to help us do in the month of June what we should have done between January and June.
[time=3133] And that is to make up that $42,000. Now, how can we make up $42,000? Well, a good Sunday morning
[time=3141] here, not Easter, but just a really good Sunday morning. There would be 1,700 people. You'd take
[time=3148] 1,700, divide it in 42,000, round numbers off in evangelical terms, come out with $25 a piece. Can I give $25? Yes, but that's a piece. I've got five in my family.
[time=3163] That means 125. Can I do that? I can do that. Now, I heard one of my friends say,
[time=3169] boy, I'm glad my daughter got married. She can carry her own $25.
[time=3175] Can I afford 25? Yes. Can I afford more? I can. And I need to do more.
[time=3180] Out of our resources, what is it that we can do? Some will say, I cannot do that,
[time=3188] then God does not expect you to do that. But many of us can do that. Many of us can do way beyond
[time=3195] that. And we need to ask you to do that now. You may not be able to day put that check or that
[time=3202] cash in an envelope, but we need to ask you to make a commitment. That's why we put a card in there, because we need to know now what you're doing, because if we can't eliminate this deficit, then we're going to have to eliminate it, and it's going to be very costly.
[time=3215] You see, as you look at our church budget, saving 10% of our money is an astronomical task,
[time=3224] because you see, over half of our budget is fixed. Things we cannot change. We cannot change
[time=3231] our bond payments. That's a third of our budget. We cannot change our missionary commitments. We
[time=3238] can't write a letter to somebody like Kathy Bristol outside of Monrovia, Liberia, and say, "Dear Kathy, we won't be able to send you any more support. I hope they have rowboats that cross the Atlantic so you can come home." That's another 10% of our budget. Another 10% of our budget or
[time=3255] more are things like utilities and insurance that aren't going to change. And so when you try to
[time=3262] save 10%, you can only save it out of half of the budget. And if you want to try to carve 20% out of our budget, we're going to eliminate one-fourth of everything that we do here.
[time=3272] That means one-fourth of the people who work here can't work here. That means one-fourth of the
[time=3278] air conditioning can't be on. That means one-fourth of the materials that our children are using in
[time=3284] Sunday School we can't use. I need to bore you with all that. And I don't want to paint the picture
[time=3290] worse than it is, but we need you to respond in two ways. One is to eliminate that deficit.
[time=3297] And the second is to begin regular giving as a part of your spiritual commitment.
[time=3303] To take these principles, to recognize it's God's plan, then to say I'll follow the principles of
[time=3311] responsibility, regularity, out of my resources. Now let me give you the third aspect of what Paul
[time=3318] says here. That's his purpose. If you look at the end of verse two, there's a purpose clause.
[time=3322] You can recognize the purpose clause by the words so that. He says, so that when I come,
[time=3329] no collections will have to be made. You know, Paul's appeal is he says, let's give weekly,
[time=3335] let's give regularly, let's collect it then, so that when I come, I don't have to come and say, we're behind in the Corinthian budget. I think Paul liked fundraising about as well as you,
[time=3347] and I like it. Not too well at all. And the whole purpose of these principles of regular,
[time=3354] consistent giving is so that there need not be any crisis appeal. We are not in a crisis.
[time=3361] I don't want to cry wolf wolf to you, but I am warning you that we are on the verge of that,
[time=3367] but if we would just give regularly out of our responsibility, God would care for
[time=3374] every need that we have. And we wouldn't have to ever worry about, I wonder what Sunday we're going to hear the wolf message again. Paul said, I'm teaching you these principles to avoid the
[time=3387] crisis. And then the fourth aspect of what he says is protection. God's given the plan,
[time=3393] he's given principles to work the plan. He's told us the purpose of the plan. Now here's how he protects, verse three. Then when I come, I'll take the money and get out of town. No.
[time=3404] Then when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men, you approve and send them with your
[time=3413] money to Jerusalem. Accountability and integrity is critical. One of the most important things
[time=3424] that we can have in our church is men that you approve, not men that I pick, men that you approve.
[time=3432] That's why every year, now on the first Sunday of February, we have an election and you approve
[time=3439] men and it is their responsibility to count the money, to oversee the budget and to make sure
[time=3446] that every penny goes where it is budgeted to go. I can't write checks in this church.
[time=3453] I'm thankful for that. I don't ever have to be worried about being tempted. I don't have any
[time=3459] authority. If you're looking for somebody with authority in this church, come to me. I have as
[time=3465] little as anybody and I don't want that responsibility. I want that responsibility to be the men you
[time=3473] select out. 1,700 of us can't get together and vote on whether we ought to put Venetian blinds in the chapel or hang black baggies. But 17 men can oversee a budget and plan on it and that's protection.
[time=3486] That gives ministry integrity. But you know as we talk about money, in many ways, it troubles us
[time=3494] because money is only a side issue of the big issue and that's lordship. It's the measurable
[time=3501] dimension of our life that brings in the question, "Is Jesus my Lord?"
[time=3508] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our Sanctuary Choir, celebration and a duet
[time=3523] by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe. The message today was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3528] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to pray this prayer with you right now. Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3537] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my
[time=3544] sins. And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I know that if I invite you in,
[time=3550] you can become my savior and cleanse me and free me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3555] I ask you to come into my heart today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3560] If you prayed this prayer today, would you write us and tell us the decision that you made?
[time=3566] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God. To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned
[time=3576] earlier entitled "When Your Comfort Zone Gets Squeezed", please write to the Bible hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. To receive a cassette copy of today's message,
[time=3589] write and request tape number 1346 or use the sermon title "Integrity with Finances" and please
[time=3596] enclose a gift of three dollars to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3600] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club,
