[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=123] Thank you for joining us.
[time=124] Our speaker today will be the administrator of the Black Hawk Christian School, Steve Longbrake.
[time=130] Steve will be speaking from Joel chapter two in a message he has entitled, "Where Is Their God?" We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Joel chapter two.
[time=139] We'll be looking at verses 12 through 17.
[time=142] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=145] We will also be hearing from Joni King.
[time=150] And Brian Losey.
[time=151] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=161] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=164] Now here's Pete Coby.
[time=167] - I want again to thank you for worshiping with us today
[time=175] and coming to fellowship together.
[time=178] It's much more of a warm situation when we look out there and we see the blue seeds filled with people rather than empty chairs.
[time=186] We hope that you'll sing with us and that you'll pray and you'll be prepared for the message that God has for us today.
[time=193] We also welcome those of you that are watching by way of the Bible Hour.
[time=196] We're always glad to hear from people throughout the week that are unable to attend church, but can worship with us each Sunday morning through the Bible Hour.
[time=206] About 4.30 this morning, there was a small gathering of 31 people along with our pastor that got together in our parking lot, got in the bus and went out to Barefield to board the plane that would head for Miami and eventually for Jamaica.
[time=223] 31 of our people have gone for two weeks to work down there with our missionaries, to worship together with them, to help them spread the gospel of Jesus Christ in this way.
[time=233] We're really excited about the opportunities these people have and I want you to pray for them throughout the next two weeks.
[time=239] And then we look forward to them returning and telling us of the ministry that they had and working with those people, helping them to build buildings, caring for their medical needs and what a privilege it is for our church to support this kind of an endeavor.
[time=253] We still have a ministry however, right here in the area of Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=258] People need the Lord and as you pass them and as you see them from day to day, be reminded that indeed our country and our area right here in Fort Wayne, there are people lost, need Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=271] The choir sings, "People Need the Lord." (gentle music)
[time=291] [MUSIC - 228 seconds]
[time=525] - Quite a challenge for all of us to realize
[time=541] that we are most responsible.
[time=543] It's a privilege to come here and to preach the gospel and then to give an invitation at the end of our service.
[time=550] What a greater privilege it is for each of you to be missionaries out in the workplace identifying with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=557] We have some announcements that are found in your bulletin that we want you to take particular note of.
[time=562] Use that as your guide throughout the week.
[time=565] First of all, tonight is a special program in the life of our service.
[time=569] We have the Sunday School Workers' Appreciation Service.
[time=572] That's a time of recognition for all the Sunday School Workers in our Sunday School.
[time=576] There are a great number of people that sacrificially give of their time to teach our children.
[time=582] Will you join with us tonight and be here so that we can recognize in a special way all the workers in our Sunday School?
[time=589] Come and join with us at 6 p.m.
[time=591] The patriotic panoramas coming up on July 3rd.
[time=594] Be reminded that the concert starts at four o'clock.
[time=597] The sanctuary choir will be singing patriotic hymns and special music that you'll be familiar with.
[time=603] We'll also have as our guest, the King's Brass, a group of nine musicians that will really be inspiring to your hearts as they play for us.
[time=610] Plan for that.
[time=612] Before that, plan to come right after the service from one to three o'clock and join with us in a picnic.
[time=618] All of the chicken has been ordered and all the special food.
[time=622] And now all we need for you to do is be sure that you have a ticket.
[time=625] That will relieve our minds a little bit that you're all coming.
[time=628] We know you are, but that'll just help us.
[time=631] If you go to the registration table at the chapel and let them know that you'd like to purchase a ticket for the dinner, come and join with us.
[time=638] Bring your blankets and lawn chairs.
[time=640] We'll have a great afternoon.
[time=642] There'll be displays of hobbies that our people do throughout their free time.
[time=647] It'll be a great time of fellowship, games for the children and a good afternoon with all of our church people.
[time=653] The Summer Bible Conference continues.
[time=655] We've already had two great weeks with Dr. John Davis.
[time=660] This week, we begin a series of films by Harold Morris.
[time=665] The films are entitled Twice Pardon.
[time=668] Excellent story of how God miraculously intervened in the life of Harold Morris, who was convicted twice of murder and was miraculously pardoned.
[time=677] An excellent film series, please come with us.
[time=680] Just a reminder now that our parking has been expanded on the other side of State Street, may I encourage you to park there.
[time=687] And may I discourage you from parking on Lamire.
[time=691] The neighbors have been very gracious, but they did remind us again that there is a hazard with us parking on both sides of the street as you enter Black Hawk.
[time=699] So please make every effort to not park on Lamire Street, but park in the expanding parking lot across the street.
[time=706] Next week, our guest speaker in the absence of our pastor will be Tracy Howard.
[time=711] Tracy Howard is the pastor of the Grace Bible Church in Bern, Indiana.
[time=715] You'll want to come and hear him.
[time=717] We're going to continue now with our service.
[time=721] We want John verse, but to come, there is a verse in your bulletin each week.
[time=726] And we want you to take that verse right now and stand with John as he comes and leads us in the quotation of our verse for the week.
[time=735] Would you stand together as John comes?
[time=742] A verse for today is Philippians 4.9.
[time=745] Now in the bulletin last week, we should have had Philippians 4.8.
[time=754] Well, because of the commissioning service that I was going to Jamaica, we didn't get to use it.
[time=759] So Philippians 4.8 will be used next week.
[time=762] We encourage you to learn this verse.
[time=765] This morning, we'll have Philippians 4.9.
[time=768] Let's repeat the reference and then the verse and then the reference.
[time=774] Philippians 4.9, whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me,
[time=785] put it into practice.
[time=788] And the God of peace will be with you.
[time=791] Philippians 4.9.
[time=794] Thank you.
[time=798] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=911] - This is a special day in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church, 31 of our members along with our pastor Rick Hawks
[time=927] left barefield this morning for Jamaica.
[time=930] While they're in Jamaica, they'll be working with the natives there and our missionaries in presenting the gospel through tents and street meetings and they will also be building a new church building, a very exciting time in the life of our lay people as they get a chance to see firsthand some of the missionaries and mission fields that we support here at our church.
[time=951] It's really an exciting time for us and we're anxious for them to come back and to give us word of what is happening around the world in the area of missions.
[time=959] Our pastor will be gone for two weeks and in his absence today we have our school administrator, the administrator of the Black Hawk Christian School, Steve Longbrake, speaking to us.
[time=971] You'll be encouraged and our hearts will be refreshed as he speaks to us and as he reminds us of the role of Christian education in the lives of our children.
[time=982] And speaking of Christian education, our school is accepting applications right now.
[time=987] The Black Hawk Christian School is exciting event.
[time=990] We miss the kids as they're gone for the summer, but they'll be back in the fall.
[time=994] And if you would be interested in enrolling your children in Christian education at the Black Hawk Christian School, now is the time to check to see if your class is open.
[time=1005] You can receive information by calling the school at 493-7400.
[time=1013] That's an exciting time to recognize that your children can be involved in Christian education.
[time=1018] Next week we'll be having a special guest right here from our area from Bern, Indiana, Tracy Howard of the Grace Baptist Church will be with us.
[time=1027] He's also a part-time professor at Grace Theological Seminary in Warsaw, Indiana.
[time=1034] We want to introduce him by way of videotape.
[time=1037] - Hello, my name is Tracy Howard.
[time=1039] I'm pastor of Grace Bible Church in Bern, Indiana.
[time=1043] Do you ever experience stress?
[time=1045] Do you ever experience worry or struggle with anxiety as a result of trying and difficult circumstances that come your way?
[time=1052] If you do, join us Sunday Father's Day on June the 19th.
[time=1056] Here on the Bible Hour, we'll be discussing the question, "How do I find lasting peace?" - We're looking forward to the ministry of Tracy Howard.
[time=1066] He mentioned in the video that he'd be speaking on Father's Day, and just a reminder that will be aired one week later on the Bible Hour on June 26th.
[time=1074] Be sure and tune in for that day.
[time=1076] While we have another special event coming up in the life of our church, the 15th annual Patriotic Panorama will be held Sunday, July 3rd.
[time=1084] We're gonna have a great time.
[time=1085] It'll be a little different Patriotic Panorama this year because we're going to have it outdoors.
[time=1090] It will be located behind the new worship center across the street from our present building on State Boulevard.
[time=1097] That program will begin at four o'clock.
[time=1099] There are no tickets necessary.
[time=1101] You just come, bring your blanket or a lawn chair, and sit out on the lawn and enjoy patriotic music from our sanctuary choir, and special guests, the King's Brass.
[time=1111] You'll enjoy this great time of fellowship and be a relaxed atmosphere.
[time=1115] Bring the entire family and join us on July 3rd at four o'clock.
[time=1119] From time to time, we offer booklets on the Bible Hour that encourage your life.
[time=1126] And again, there's another one that we want to introduce to you.
[time=1130] It's entitled "Grief's Healing Process." This booklet is by Charles Sell.
[time=1136] Crisis is not always bad.
[time=1138] It can become a turning point in your life for the good.
[time=1141] If you'd like the steps of how to cope with grief and understand God's plan for refreshing your life and helping you through times of difficulty, we'd like to send you this booklet today.
[time=1153] If you'll write us at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1163] We'll send you the booklet "Grief's Healing Process." Once again, the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1175] I'd like to have you join us now as we go back to our regular program and again enjoy the ministry of our Blackhawk Christian School Administrator, Steve Longbrake.
[time=1186] (dramatic music)
[time=1196] [MUSIC - 251 seconds]
[time=1452] Father God, what a privilege it is to know you as Savior.
[time=1468] Then after taking that first step, what a joy that we have through communion of the Holy Spirit and through God's Word, to grow, to get to know you, how we long for that.
[time=1478] And Lord, because we're here together, that's evidence that our hearts are open for what you have for us today and pray that we might be alert and use those things that we receive from your Word to strengthen our lives and to draw us closer to you.
[time=1492] We do pray for Lord, for those that are hurting today, those that have extreme circumstances that really need your peace and guidance, that they will draw close to you and that they will find the peace that passes all understanding right now.
[time=1505] Give them a warm heart and give them that strength and desire to draw on your strength today.
[time=1512] Plus, Steve, as he preaches this morning that you'll give him freedom, and we thank you for him.
[time=1520] Thank you for this opportunity to continue to worship.
[time=1522] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1525] The absence of our pastor, we're privileged to introduce to you someone who is very familiar to our church.
[time=1534] Steve Longbrake is the school administrator for the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1538] He's also a real dear friend.
[time=1540] We have the privilege of having offices across the hall and we get together from time to time to discuss spiritual events.
[time=1547] Even get away sometimes and have a cup of coffee and just talk about things of the Lord.
[time=1552] And he has a real true heart for people.
[time=1554] He loves them and especially he loves children.
[time=1557] Let me encourage you right now that if you have any thought of enrolling your children in the Black Hawk Christian School, number one, you ought to do it.
[time=1566] Number two, if that desire is there, you ought to call the office tomorrow morning.
[time=1571] We're thankful that the school is rapidly filling up an enrollment and that's a good sign that things are going well.
[time=1578] We appreciate the teachers.
[time=1579] We also appreciate our school administrator, Steve Longbrake.
[time=1583] He's going to come and speak to us and we're glad that he's here and we're glad that he's a part of our staff.
[time=1588] Come, Steve.
[time=1589] Thanks.
[time=1594] - Peter and I have had a lot of times to talk in our offices.
[time=1599] I was sitting there thinking that he used to come over and talk to me a lot more when I was coaching his son on the basketball team.
[time=1605] I don't know if that, I guess Peter was vying for a starting position at that time.
[time=1611] (audience laughing) I want to take this opportunity to do something that I couldn't do if Rick were here.
[time=1619] And that is just to first of all say to all of you how thankful I am that God has given me the privilege to serve with you.
[time=1629] I get paid for it.
[time=1630] Many of you serve here about as much as I do and you don't get paid.
[time=1634] But I'm really grateful that he's given me the honor to work with you in this school and church.
[time=1639] And I've been here for nine years now.
[time=1642] Seven of those I've worked for Rick and with him.
[time=1647] And if he were here, I'm sure he'd run over here and grab me and not let me say anything nice about him.
[time=1652] So I'll take this opportunity just to tell you that in this day when the church at large and individuals leading the church are really being evaluated and there seems sometimes to be a lack of trust, I have never met a man of greater integrity than Rick.
[time=1672] And I'm really grateful that we have a chance to have him as our pastor and me as my boss and my friend.
[time=1678] And we need to pray for them.
[time=1680] They are now sitting in the Miami airport, waiting to be plain to Jamaica.
[time=1687] And I'm sure that they are excited, but they must be tired.
[time=1690] They got up at four o'clock this morning to take off.
[time=1693] I understand that everybody at the airport had on a yellow t-shirt that was in the group except George Lantman.
[time=1698] When he comes back, you need a zap George for that.
[time=1702] Not long ago, a couple weeks ago,
[time=1708] Renee, my wife, and Bob Freeborn and I had the privilege of going with the seniors who had graduated 15 of the seniors that had graduated on a senior trip.
[time=1718] And we traveled around New England and enjoyed a lot of things.
[time=1723] Got tired and had some mishaps, but not many.
[time=1727] Several things struck me as we traveled through New England.
[time=1732] I'd been east before, but I'd never been to some of the larger cities on the east coast.
[time=1738] And we went in to Boston.
[time=1740] And while in Boston, we took a walk on the Freedom Trail and saw things that I really have interest in being a history and political science major.
[time=1750] And the Old North Church in Paul Revere's house and everything there had a lot of meaning to me.
[time=1756] But what struck me most in that city was the fact that there were so many people
[time=1768] in different social and economic levels that all had one thing in common.
[time=1774] They just seem to be so many people without peace, lost souls.
[time=1781] We saw men and women getting into their limousines coming out of the Ritz Hotel.
[time=1787] We saw one man who wouldn't allow the doorkeeper to take care of his luggage.
[time=1794] He had to put his luggage in his own Ferrari because he was afraid that somebody would mistreat the Ferrari.
[time=1799] It's funny, you know, you reach a certain level of income and you have your own limousine, you don't really mind if other people damage that when you get your Ferrari.
[time=1806] You want to take care of that one yourself.
[time=1809] And then walking just up the street to Boston Commons, walking through the park, to see men and women who'd spent the night there in the park or someplace close by, lying on a park bench with what they owned on their back and in a bottle in their hand.
[time=1827] Lying there, trying to sleep in the warmth of the sunshine because it'd probably been cool in the evening.
[time=1834] And I thought, what a difference, you know.
[time=1836] We have people from every economic strata in this city and they're all different and yet they have one thing in common.
[time=1845] They're either saved and have hope for eternity
[time=1852] no matter what their condition is here in Boston or they're unsaved and they have no hope for eternity no matter what their condition is here in Boston, whether it be rich or poor.
[time=1865] Those people struck me, who walked through the park and saw a man standing on top of one of those park benches preaching and he was really getting into it.
[time=1876] He was screaming at the top of his voice proclaiming the truth of the gospel.
[time=1881] And at first I have to admit, I cringed a little and I thought, oh, you know, this is a little weird.
[time=1885] And then I thought about the fact that what he was saying was absolutely the truth.
[time=1891] And there probably were folks there who hadn't heard the truth.
[time=1897] Or if they had, maybe this was the time that the Spirit of God was penetrating their heart and they were hearing the truth.
[time=1904] We have a lost nation, a lost group of people who need the truth of the word of God.
[time=1912] Alexander Solzhenitsyn is one of my favorite scholars and authors.
[time=1918] And I have my government class read many of his writings because he just is really popular with me.
[time=1924] He won the Nobel Peace Prize, Nobel Prize for Literature, rather, in 1970 and was deported from the Soviet Union because he was a dissident, wrote about the truth in the Soviet Union.
[time=1938] Ended up residing here in the United States.
[time=1940] Maybe you'll recall, the press made a really big deal of Solzhenitsyn's entry into the United States and often for that first year or so, we would hear his name mentioned on the news, read about him giving speeches, and then he died off quickly.
[time=1957] The interest in him, I think, swayed because Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a believer and proclaims the truth about God to people.
[time=1965] The press seemed to lose interest in him after that point.
[time=1970] One speech that he gave, though, was a speech that he gave when he received a prize for progress in religion.
[time=1981] In receiving this prize, Solzhenitsyn gave a speech
[time=1989] that was very good and yet very thought-provoking and pinpointed some key problems in our country.
[time=1998] Entitled his speech, "Men Have Forgotten God." Solzhenitsyn had written about prison camps in the Soviet Union.
[time=2007] He'd experienced some of those himself.
[time=2009] He'd written about society in the Soviet Union as people were threatened during Stalin's regime.
[time=2016] Stalin would send troops into cities late at night, 3 a.m.,
[time=2022] and they would penetrate a home, grab someone out of the home,
[time=2028] make sure that they shouted about the fact that someone else had turned them in, and then haul them off to some place never to be seen again.
[time=2038] And they would make sure that the word got out that maybe family members had turned their own family into the police, even though it wasn't true, because that would break down the trust among family members.
[time=2050] And in village after village and city after city, the police hauled people away in the middle of the night, wreaking havoc, and frightening everyone, and eliminating trust among the people.
[time=2062] And Solzhenitsyn says they were careful to make sure that people lost hope.
[time=2068] They practiced the art of building fear into those people so they didn't trust each other, and they didn't have hope in God.
[time=2078] That was their plan.
[time=2078] They wanted to eliminate God in the Soviet Union.
[time=2081] Solzhenitsyn says, after having been in the United States for seven years, imperceptibly through decades of gradual erosion, the meaning of life in the West
[time=2095] has ceased to be anything more than the pursuit of happiness.
[time=2101] Solzhenitsyn knew that God had established priorities for man, and he knew that the West had been established.
[time=2109] The United States government was firmly founded on the truth that the Bible had absolutes that we must build all off on.
[time=2119] And he said he could see that that had been eroding as men have forgotten God in the United States.
[time=2129] Joel said the same thing.
[time=2132] Joel proclaimed to the people in chapter two of the book of Joel that they were in need of God.
[time=2142] Let's look there together.
[time=2144] Joel chapter two, verse 12.
[time=2150] Now, children of Israel had been experiencing great famine because locusts had devoured their crops for several years.
[time=2161] I don't know if you're familiar with locusts.
[time=2164] I had an opportunity one time to see a locust swarm.
[time=2168] Locusts have been reported to be in swarms as large as 100 square miles in size.
[time=2178] And those locusts swarms would come down upon the vegetation in the area and eat their weight in vegetation every day.
[time=2186] And so if you have a solid black mass of locusts, 100 miles square, and they're eating their weight in vegetation every day, doesn't leave much vegetation for man.
[time=2197] Israelites had experienced this tragedy, and they were suffering, and they didn't repent.
[time=2206] And Joel and Joel chapter two, after describing what's been happening and getting ready to announce the day of the Lord that would continue to oppress them unless they repented.
[time=2216] And then finally as he describes the last day of the Lord in triumph and judgment, Joel says in the middle of all that discourse, chapter two, verse 12, "Even now," declares the Lord, "return to me with all your heart,
[time=2234] with fasting and weeping and mourning.
[time=2237] Render your heart and not your garments.
[time=2240] Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity." Who knows?
[time=2251] He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing, great offerings, and drink offerings for the Lord your God.
[time=2260] Now the trumpet and Zion declare a holy fast.
[time=2265] Call a sacred assembly.
[time=2267] Gather the people, consecrate the assembly.
[time=2269] Bring together the elders, gather the children, those nursing at the breast.
[time=2274] Let the bride groom, leave his room, and the bride her chamber.
[time=2278] Let the priests who minister before the Lord weep between the temple porch and the altar.
[time=2284] Let them say, "Spare your people, O Lord." Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, a byword among the nations.
[time=2296] Why should they say among the peoples, "Where is their God?" Joel cries out to his brethren, the Israelites, in Judah.
[time=2306] He screams out to them, "Now is the time for you to repent,
[time=2312] to rend your heart, tear your heart, not your clothing." They've been the practice of the Jews when things were going bad to tear your clothing and weep and mourn and wail, and they were good at that.
[time=2326] The tearing of the cloth was supposed to be symbolic for what was happening on the inside.
[time=2332] You remember Job when he was struck with all the calamities, he ripped his clothing and sat in the ashes.
[time=2337] That was an indicator that his heart was broken.
[time=2340] He was weeping and mourning over that.
[time=2342] There was something that happened internally, and he expressed that outwardly by rending the cloth of his garments.
[time=2350] The children of Israel there in Judah when Joel was alive were doing the same thing.
[time=2353] They were still rending their clothing.
[time=2355] They were still practicing religion as they knew it, but they didn't have anything on the inside that was taking place that would make God realize they were repentant and they loved him.
[time=2370] Even now, he says, "Don't wait.
[time=2377] "The day of the Lord is at hand." I remember when I was 15 years old, I was at a revival meeting, and this preacher was really preaching away,
[time=2390] and he wanted to get our attention about the times.
[time=2394] He said, "The time is at hand.
[time=2396] "Things will get bad.
[time=2399] "The time to come to the Lord is now." And so he used Noah as an illustration.
[time=2405] He said, "You know when Noah began to build that ark, "they'd never seen rain before.
[time=2410] "The earth was enveloped in a mist "that kept it moist and vegetation "was taken care of that way.
[time=2420] "But they hadn't seen rain, "and Noah started building that ark, "and his friends came up and said, "What are you building the ark for?" And he said, "Well, it's going to rain.
[time=2429] "What's rain?
[time=2430] "Well, the water's going to come down from the sky." They hadn't seen that, and so they mocked him and they laughed at him.
[time=2437] And he said, "The time is now.
[time=2439] "It's during my lifetime that this was going to happen." And sure enough, he got the thing finished, and his sons and daughters-in-law and his wife, and the animals were on board, and this revivalist started snapping his fingers.
[time=2455] Rain drop here, and a rain drop there.
[time=2460] And he said, "I got their attention." As the rain started to fall, he really clicked his fingers.
[time=2469] I can remember getting out on the edge of my seat, thinking, "Oh man, you're right.
[time=2473] "They couldn't get in the ark." Time was up.
[time=2476] The time was now.
[time=2478] That's what Joel's saying.
[time=2481] For you people that exist right here today, Joel says, "The time is now, even now." You need to render your heart, not your garment.
[time=2488] Forget the practices that you've been doing.
[time=2490] Forget the religiosity.
[time=2492] Render your heart.
[time=2493] Break your heart before the living God.
[time=2496] And it says, "Perhaps this God of compassion," look at these verses.
[time=2502] "Return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious "and compassionate," in the middle of verse 13.
[time=2507] "Slow to anger and abounding in love, "and He relents from sending calamity." Who knows?
[time=2516] He may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing.
[time=2519] Joel's saying to those folks, "This God that we know, He's a God of graciousness, "of compassion, of being slow to anger, "abounding in love." These very same phrases were used, identical phrases.
[time=2535] Were used in Exodus 32 and 34.
[time=2538] When the description of God is given there, while Moses is on Mount Sinai, and the people remember are losing heart, Moses is not with them, he's not leading them.
[time=2549] And so they are taking their gold, collecting it.
[time=2553] Remember Aaron says to Moses when Moses came back, "We gathered all the gold, we melted it down." There was a calf.
[time=2559] Well, they made the calf.
[time=2562] And God is described with these very same phrases when those people were building the calf.
[time=2569] It says He was slow to anger and abounding in love.
[time=2573] That's our God.
[time=2575] He's not like you and me.
[time=2577] I'm grateful.
[time=2578] We're quick to anger.
[time=2581] Proverbs says a fool always loses his temper.
[time=2586] And a wise man holds it back.
[time=2589] Doesn't say we don't have anger.
[time=2591] He just says we are trying to hold it back.
[time=2594] But God's slow to anger.
[time=2597] Abounding in love.
[time=2600] He loves us so much.
[time=2601] And Joel's telling those people, "If you'll just repent, "render your heart, break it before God.
[time=2608] "Perhaps this God who's slow to anger, "who's compassionate, who loves you, "who's abounding in love for you, "perhaps he'll send the blessing." And I like that next verse that says, "Who knows?" Joel doesn't know.
[time=2622] Man doesn't know.
[time=2623] God is sovereign.
[time=2625] He blesses whom he blesses, has mercy on whom he has mercy.
[time=2630] He says, "I don't know who knows maybe." There's a chance, yeah, there is.
[time=2635] If we'll repent, then he might even give us the privilege of providing him or giving to us an offering to lift up to him.
[time=2645] I like that.
[time=2646] It says, "Who knows he may turn and have pity "and leave behind a blessing." What's the blessing?
[time=2655] The blessing is grain offerings and drink offerings to give back to him.
[time=2660] He blesses us by giving us the privilege of lifting up an offering to him.
[time=2666] A little different to what we usually think about a blessing.
[time=2670] He's sovereign.
[time=2675] And then, there's several verses, verses 15 through 17, that call for the whole nation to come out.
[time=2685] And Joel was saying to those people, "No matter what you're doing, this is a priority." If you just got married, bride, groom, you're in your room and bride, you're in the chamber.
[time=2696] Even if you just got married, come out.
[time=2699] This is the most important event that could take place.
[time=2702] I'm telling you, I learned real quick what the most important event was in my life here on this earth as far as physically when Renee, when I forgot our anniversary one time.
[time=2711] I knew real quick, there's an event to that wedding.
[time=2716] That marriage is an event that takes a priority over everything.
[time=2721] When you set that date a few months ahead of time, there aren't many things that could possibly change that date.
[time=2728] It is a priority, the wedding and the marriage.
[time=2731] And he's saying even that bride, groom, and even that bride come out, this is a priority.
[time=2736] As a nation, we need to weep and mourn and repent.
[time=2740] Maybe he'll relent, have mercy on us.
[time=2745] The priests who minister before the Lord, weep between the temple porch and the altar as they're going before God.
[time=2754] Let them say, spare your people, O Lord.
[time=2757] Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn.
[time=2762] Now that was in Judah, children of Israel, probably in the 500s BC.
[time=2770] And yet, as I think about what Solzhenitsyn said about our own country as he looked at the United States and asked a question or made a statement, rather, men have forgotten God.
[time=2785] I wonder if it isn't appropriate for us to look at the passage of Scripture like this and see what we can gain from studying it and trying to implement what Joel told these people they had to do in Judah, and perhaps God'll give a blessing.
[time=2801] First of all, he says to render your heart.
[time=2807] I told you I saw two different groups of people in Boston.
[time=2814] Of course, there were lots of others in between, but they were the super affluent, no doubt about it.
[time=2819] You know what they were seeking?
[time=2823] They were in pursuit of happiness through their Ferrari or their limo or whatever they were getting.
[time=2830] And that other group of people were pursuing happiness
[time=2836] in a bottle or other people or other things.
[time=2840] But they had that one thing in common that I noticed and they lacked peace, they lacked joy.
[time=2847] Perhaps some of them were saved.
[time=2848] If they were, then they have hope forever.
[time=2853] But if they're not saved no matter what their physical circumstances are today, wealth or poverty, they're lost.
[time=2861] And the United States is filled with people who think they have pursued happiness and gained it.
[time=2867] And in reality, they're doomed to hell for eternity.
[time=2871] And Solzhenitsyn says the whole nation will collapse.
[time=2874] I believe it's true, unless men return to God.
[time=2878] Unless we establish law based on absolutes that he declares are true, we'll have consequences, natural consequences to some of those that will be devastating, AIDS is an obvious one.
[time=2893] Now's the time, that preacher that was standing up
[time=2900] on that park bench in Boston, there was a preacher who just screamed it out, the truth of the word of God.
[time=2908] And you know what?
[time=2909] The some of the drunks that were gathered around there were mocking him.
[time=2913] One was on the bench right under his feet.
[time=2916] And as the preacher preached, the drunk on the bench was saying, "Amen, yeah, preach it, brother." He just mocked him.
[time=2925] And then there were others out there who joined in and they mocked him.
[time=2928] You know what? The truth is mocked today in the United States.
[time=2932] Now I may not be the one that has chosen to stand on the park bench, but there are lots of opportunities that I have that I fear sharing the truth because I fear the ridicule and the scorn that I might get from that.
[time=2945] We're gonna be mocked folks if we stand true to the word.
[time=2950] We're gonna be mocked if we establish our own lifestyle based on absolutes that God has ordained.
[time=2958] We're gonna be mocked if we teach our children that those are true and you cannot compromise on those issues.
[time=2966] We'll be mocked.
[time=2967] I'd rather be mocked for that than have a nation across the ocean or right next to us or people's next door say, "Where is their God?" Now's the time.
[time=2987] We have a compassionate and gracious God.
[time=2990] Who knows? He may bless us.
[time=2993] A sovereign God can do that if we'll repent.
[time=2999] When we walked through that park,
[time=3007] I noticed a few people that were standing
[time=3013] around the outskirts of the park.
[time=3016] And they were listening.
[time=3018] That preacher preached and preached.
[time=3022] And they stood there and listened and they weren't mocking, they were paying attention.
[time=3027] And so we stayed there for a while.
[time=3029] And he got finished, didn't have any kind
[time=3035] of altar call or anything.
[time=3037] And I thought, well, that's that.
[time=3039] He jumped down off the bench and from out on the sidewalk, another young man about 25 years old came sauntering up to that park bench, walked up on the bench, stood there, stuck his Bible up beside his mouth and started preaching.
[time=3053] Loudly, louder than the other guy.
[time=3055] We could hear him way down the park.
[time=3057] And I thought, yeah, there's not just one.
[time=3060] He couldn't stand there forever.
[time=3063] And we can't take it individually.
[time=3066] But collectively, if we together would work together, we could make some things change.
[time=3073] We could scream out to our whole country, let's change.
[time=3075] Francis Schafer in A Christian Manifesto says that,
[time=3082] yes, it's true that there's a silent majority in the United States.
[time=3087] He says that there's a majority of the people that are more conservative economically have an interest in conservative things.
[time=3099] And they are pretty quiet.
[time=3101] And you know, President Nixon would often call up on the silent majority to come out so that we could change things politically in our country.
[time=3108] Schafer is quick to let us know that the majority of the silent majority are people who are conservative economically, but they aren't standing on the truths of the Bible.
[time=3125] They want those conservative policies to be established in our country so that they can continue to pursue their happiness, affluence, personal peace.
[time=3134] Give me some security and some freedom.
[time=3140] They aren't screaming out from their majority in the silent majority.
[time=3147] We want absolutes.
[time=3149] They're screaming out.
[time=3151] We want more.
[time=3152] I think Schafer's right.
[time=3155] But you know what, you and I have an opportunity to make a difference.
[time=3160] Just as Solzhenitsyn described the Soviet Union and how it could change if it would have religious revival,
[time=3171] we could have religious revival, a true heart rendering here in the United States.
[time=3177] There's a bulletin board in room 127 right down the hall.
[time=3182] You should stop in and see it when you get a chance.
[time=3184] The kids there in the ninth grade Bible class put together several bulletin boards describing for us the names of God in Hebrew.
[time=3194] And their assignment was to put the Hebrew letters up there and then the English translation of those Hebrew letters.
[time=3202] And then in some way, in a picture, depict for the person evaluating their bulletin board, what that name for God actually means.
[time=3213] There's one name for God that I really love down there.
[time=3216] It's Jehovah Rafa.
[time=3217] And on this bulletin board, it's the last one, Top.
[time=3223] Has a picture of a heart like ours.
[time=3228] And through the middle of that heart is a jagged breaking line, a broken heart.
[time=3235] And it has a psalm to quote there.
[time=3239] But that broken heart isn't there alone.
[time=3242] From the clouds, there is an arm drawn reaching down toward that heart, the arm of God.
[time=3251] It's a powerful looking arm.
[time=3252] They did a good job there.
[time=3254] And yet there's some peace in that arm, some comfort.
[time=3257] That arm has a needle and a thread in it.
[time=3260] And I thought, boy, those students, they did a great job.
[time=3264] God, the healer, that's who he is.
[time=3267] They did a great job depicting the fact that with his needle and thread, only God can suture the heart, the broken heart, the spiritually humbled heart of a person who recognizes their sin and repents.
[time=3284] Man can't do that, but God can, and he sutures that heart.
[time=3290] He's so compassionate and so loving that he will suture.
[time=3297] He will heal our broken heart, but break it before him.
[time=3302] That's what he wants from us.
[time=3303] When I was 17, my dad bought a new car,
[time=3310] newest one we'd had since I was born.
[time=3312] Actually, it wasn't real new.
[time=3315] Avas had had it for a little while, and they sold it, and my dad bought it.
[time=3320] But it seemed new to me, and it was beautiful.
[time=3323] It was light green, and it was at the very beginning of those times when they started to slope the back window down so that the cars looked a little sleeker than they did when they were all chopped off in boxes like they are today.
[time=3336] And this car that was so sleek, just, I loved it.
[time=3341] And my dad was proud of it.
[time=3342] It was 67 Catalina, and it was so nice.
[time=3345] They let me take it to the junior senior prom that next month, we'd had it for one month.
[time=3352] And I drove that car, and after I dropped my date off, it was about seven in the morning, I suppose I was really tired, I fell asleep in my dad's new car.
[time=3362] And I didn't just kind of mess it up.
[time=3366] I really messed it up.
[time=3369] There was, I went through a barbed wire fence lengthways, and it just kept winding around the car this way.
[time=3376] And I had a guide wire, and underneath was all, and I remember throwing that thing in the reverse.
[time=3380] And I tried, and it just sank in the mud because it was wrapped in feds.
[time=3385] But it was new, you know, and I felt so bad.
[time=3388] He came to get me, and he didn't say a word about the car, he just was so glad I was okay first.
[time=3395] Then we drove home quietly.
[time=3398] And I was so glad that it was a day when I'd been up all
[time=3405] and I'd had to go straight to bed.
[time=3408] I went into bed, and I was there asleep.
[time=3411] Finally, I woke up, and I tried to go back to sleep, and I couldn't, and I thought, well, I'm gonna have to face this Sunday, I better get up.
[time=3416] So I got up, and I marched out to my dad, and I sat down, and I can remember that there was a ball game on.
[time=3424] He kept commenting about the ball game, and I was just nodding, and pouting, and scared.
[time=3429] And I thought, what's he gonna do, what's he gonna do?
[time=3432] And pretty soon, he leaned over, and he said, you're okay, you know that?
[time=3438] I said, yeah.
[time=3439] He said, you're physically fine.
[time=3442] That car can only cost me money.
[time=3445] But you, if you'd been hurt, that would've hurt me.
[time=3450] You know what, he was so compassionate.
[time=3454] He already knew I had a broken heart.
[time=3456] I wasn't coming in there saying, well, that old car, just the car's fallen, no.
[time=3460] He knew I was broken before him in the first place.
[time=3464] I loved him, it wasn't the car, I loved him, I didn't wanna hurt him.
[time=3467] He was so compassionate, he reached out to me, he said, I love you.
[time=3472] You're okay, who cares about that car?
[time=3476] Folks, if my dad has that kind of compassion,
[time=3482] my Heavenly Father has greater compassion, he's God Almighty, he's the healer.
[time=3487] If you'll break your heart before the living God,
[time=3493] he's compassionate, he will sew up your heart.
[time=3498] Give you peace.
[time=3499] - We've been sharing with you
[time=3513] the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, and soloist, Joni King, and Brian Losin.
[time=3519] The message today was from the school administrator of the Black Hawk Christian School, Stephen Longbrake.
[time=3524] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3532] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3534] Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank you for sending your son, Jesus, to come down to this earth, to be my savior, and today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3547] I ask you to come in and to cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my savior.
[time=3554] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed that prayer with me this morning, will you write and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3563] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
