[time=90] (bells ringing) (dramatic music)
[time=120] - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=127] Thank you for joining us.
[time=129] While Pastor Rick is away, our guest speaker will be Tracy Howard, pastor of the Grace Bible Church in Burn, Indiana.
[time=135] Pastor Howard's message is entitled "The Prescription Bottle" or "The Peace of God." Our text is Philippians chapter four, verses six and seven.
[time=144] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=148] Other special music will be provided by Theresa Rust and Kerry Johnson.
[time=156] The Bible Hours and Outreach Ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=165] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=170] Now, here's Pete Kobe.
[time=173] - The spoken word a little later on.
[time=175] Right now we welcome to the viewers of our Bible Hour.
[time=178] We're glad that you're with us and hope that you stay with us for the entire hour.
[time=183] We sang songs about the love of our Lord Jesus Christ and now the choir sings a medley speaking of the holiness of the Lord.
[time=191] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=194] (dramatic music)
[time=205] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of the Black Hawk.
[time=543] Good morning. I'm Ray Train, and I'm the treasurer at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=551] And I'm going to give you a little financial update this morning.
[time=555] But first, I'd like to thank Pete Coby. Pete is kind of directing things around here as Rick is in Jamaica with our team, and I think he's been doing an excellent job over these last couple of Sundays.
[time=567] I want to personally thank the 173 families who have participated by giving a special gift to our above and beyond offering. And I also want to thank those of you that are planning on doing it today. Plus, there's another group, a large group of people that have simply increased their weekly offerings, and we want to give thanks for you as well.
[time=593] If you can look at your bulletin, we're very close to the goal.
[time=597] We're only $13,700 from our total goal of $42,000.
[time=605] You know, I didn't believe that that would happen. I didn't believe it could happen.
[time=609] We were sitting around in a board room and discussing the problems and possible solutions.
[time=617] My solution was cut to cost.
[time=621] Some of the other deacons spoke up and said we shouldn't cut expenses and cut programs until we've given our people the opportunity to respond to the need. I'm thinking they're sitting around like a group of congressmen and no guts to cut spending. But I'm certainly glad that our congregation proved me wrong because we're very, very close to our goal. You know, we've all heard sermons that say God doesn't need our money. And I agree with that.
[time=653] But God has chosen us to be his witness.
[time=657] To be his witness in this community in Jamaica and all over the world through the efforts of our missionaries. And that takes money.
[time=665] God has instructed us to give because it's good for us to give.
[time=673] You know, the Gospel of Mark teaches us that our treasure and our talents are to be exercised and if they're not exercised, they rust.
[time=685] So we need to use our treasures and our talents well.
[time=689] And I challenge those families and those individuals here in the congregation today that haven't yet to participate in our above and beyond special offering to do so today. To let God work through you and help you grow. We have a special theme around here now for the last couple of weeks. And the theme is in the black before Rick is back. That's what we're striving for.
[time=717] Thank you.
[time=721] Thank you, Ray. We appreciate that information.
[time=725] Continue to sing together now, hymn number 28.
[time=729] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together of hymn number 28.
[time=739] [MUSIC - 88 seconds]
[time=832] This morning we continue in music as Teresa Rust comes to sing for us.
[time=841] She'll be accompanied at the piano by her husband Bill.
[time=844] Let's listen as this couple minister to us in song.
[time=847] [MUSIC - 213 seconds]
[time=1065] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=1068] Last week I mentioned to you that Rick Hawks, along with 30 of our members of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, are in Jamaica doing missionary work.
[time=1075] Last week Rick called and reported that they are having three Sunday services today.
[time=1080] Two of them had existing churches and they're starting a brand new church in a small community there.
[time=1085] They've been averaging about a hundred during the week in preparation for Sunday service.
[time=1090] We're excited about the ministry that we have in Jamaica with our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=1095] Just a few minutes ago in our regular service, you heard Ray Treen, one of the members of our board, explain the deficit that we have in our budget.
[time=1103] We are thankful that our people are responding and we are slowly erasing our summer deficit and hope to be caught up this week.
[time=1110] We also have needs during the Bible Hour ministry.
[time=1113] And if you have not ever given to the Bible Hour, this could be an opportune time for you to help us catch up in our deficit that we have in our television ministry too.
[time=1123] If you feel led to give, we hope that you'll give this week.
[time=1126] Our patriotic panorama is coming up and it'll be just one week from the viewing of this telecast on July 3rd.
[time=1133] It's at four o'clock in the afternoon behind our new worship center.
[time=1137] We have a large field there where we'll be having an outdoor concert with our guests, the Kings Brass and our sanctuary choir.
[time=1145] Bring your blankets and chairs and come and join with us at four o'clock July 3rd for that great patriotic program.
[time=1152] Our summer Bible Conference is continuing.
[time=1155] We've had three great weeks of ministry.
[time=1157] Again, this Wednesday night we'll be reviewing the second in a series of films by Harold Morris entitled Twice Pardon.
[time=1165] This is an excellent time during the middle of the week to get away for one hour and just join us at seven o'clock on Wednesday evenings for special programs during our summer Bible Conference.
[time=1175] We want to invite you to come and join us.
[time=1178] Just a moment now we're going to show you some of our new building, the progress that has gone on.
[time=1184] This is the front of our building.
[time=1186] It's been paved now and we have an island there for a drop-off and that's looking to the east and the new building on the right.
[time=1194] As you enter that front area you'd come into our lobby area.
[time=1198] This has been already cemented in most areas and it's a large gathering place.
[time=1203] There'll be plenty of room as people come in to greet one another and then eventually as they go under that walkway they would enter the main sanctuary.
[time=1211] The walkway above is the exit from the balcony.
[time=1215] If you've been by the building you see green plastic on the outside.
[time=1219] Eventually there'll be a large stained glass window in that area.
[time=1223] We've now entered the sanctuary and for about three months there's been scaffolding all over the floor up to the ceiling and they have been putting in this particular ceiling.
[time=1233] You're looking from the lower part of the auditorium up to our new ceiling looking from the back of the auditorium to the front.
[time=1240] Especially designed for acoustical treatment and for aesthetics.
[time=1244] It's a beautiful, beautiful ceiling.
[time=1246] This man is just putting the finishing touches of paint and plaster on our new ceiling.
[time=1252] He's up in the balcony on the far west corner.
[time=1256] They've begun now in the balcony to put the stairways in.
[time=1264] They'll be poured stairways. This is the balcony.
[time=1267] It's a large tiered area that will seat about 750 people.
[time=1272] You're looking now at the back of the building and behind the sanctuary is our choir room.
[time=1279] This is my area and I'm excited about the development of a choir room that is tiered and will seat about 150 people.
[time=1287] This is right behind the choir room as you look at the building from looking north behind the building.
[time=1294] There's a large grassy area because of no rain.
[time=1298] It's kind of dry right now, but that's the area that we're going to have for our new, that is, for our patriotic panorama.
[time=1305] We're excited about the new building and it continues to progress.
[time=1308] And Lord willing, we'll be in in the fall and we'll be announcing our dedication services to you in October.
[time=1315] Each week we announce to you a booklet that we offer for our listeners.
[time=1319] I was thinking about this booklet as I read it this week and I was thinking about the summertime and as we go to a pond and we see its serenity, and as soon as we pick up a little stone and plop it into that pond, you see ripples and action immediately.
[time=1333] Sometimes grief comes into what is basically a serene life and immediately our minds and our hearts get churned up.
[time=1340] This is the time when we can ask God's healing process to take place.
[time=1344] And this is the title of our booklet that we're offering this month on the Bible Hour.
[time=1348] It'll be an encouragement to you and I'd like to send it to you right now.
[time=1352] You can receive the booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1362] Once again, the booklet is entitled God's Healing Process, and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1375] As we go back to our regular service, we're privileged to have pastor Tracy Howard from the Burn Bible Church with us, and we're so glad that he's here and he is filling in as the Minister of the Day and the absence of our pastor.
[time=1389] We're going back to our regular service now and we'll be encouraged by his message.
[time=1405] [MUSIC]
[time=1435] They don't know that I go running home and I fall down.
[time=1443] They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[time=1451] And I'm my son and dad in just a while.
[time=1458] Sleep inside this hour.
[time=1463] The warrior is a child.
[time=1467] [MUSIC - 6 seconds]
[time=1481] Unafraid because his armor is the best.
[time=1487] For even soldiers need a quiet place to rest.
[time=1495] People say that I'm amazing.
[time=1498] Every place retreats.
[time=1501] Oh no.
[time=1502] They don't see the enemies.
[time=1505] But maybe I hear speak.
[time=1508] They don't know that I go running home when I fall down.
[time=1515] They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[time=1523] And I'm my son and dad in just a while.
[time=1530] [MUSIC]
[time=1540] They don't know that I go running home when I fall down.
[time=1548] They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[time=1556] But my son and dad in just a while.
[time=1562] Sleep inside this hour.
[time=1567] Deep inside.
[time=1569] Deep inside this hour.
[time=1583] The warrior is a child.
[time=1591] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1632] Most of you are aware that one of the ministries of our church is with a shut-ins.
[time=1638] Currently visiting between 75 and 80 of these people on a regular basis.
[time=1645] One of the things that is amazing to me is the number of them who have memorized verses in past life.
[time=1656] And now those verses come back to them to encourage them.
[time=1663] Some can no longer read.
[time=1666] Some of their hearing is bad.
[time=1669] But that which they learn in the youth is that which abides with them.
[time=1674] So what I'm really saying is that you are younger ought to be memorizing these verses.
[time=1682] Take these verses out of the bulletin when you get through the bulletin and cut them out and put them on a piece of paper or a card where you can go over them and continue to memorize them.
[time=1696] Shall we stand now as we look at Philippians chapter four and verse eight.
[time=1702] We repeat the reference, then the verse, and then the reference.
[time=1709] Philippians four eight.
[time=1712] Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely.
[time=1725] Whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or phrase worthy, think about such things.
[time=1735] Philippians four eight.
[time=1738] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1746] We welcome you all back to our service this evening at 6 p.m.
[time=1749] Our own Jim Pearson will be giving the message.
[time=1752] Today in the absence of our pastor, we've been announcing to you that Tracy Howard, the pastor of the Grace Bible Church, and Bern, Indiana, we would be our guest speaker.
[time=1762] In addition to his responsibilities at the church, he also is a part-time professor at Grace Theological Seminary, Winona Lake, Indiana.
[time=1770] He had the opportunity to get to know him this morning and appreciate his ministry and his fellowship.
[time=1775] His family is here and just a wonderful family.
[time=1778] We're glad that he has the opportunity now to preach in our pulpit and the Lord bless you, Brother Howard, as you preach.
[time=1790] This is a light to be with you this Lord's Day and also this Father's Day.
[time=1794] And I'm especially excited about being able to come because Rick and I go back some time.
[time=1799] We were classmates at Grace back in 1977.
[time=1802] In fact, he helped us move into our mobile home.
[time=1805] And so he was one of my first acquaintances in seminary.
[time=1810] And it's just a delight to be with you and minister to you this morning.
[time=1815] American society has become, in my opinion, an expert in the ability to numb emotional pain.
[time=1824] And yet society still remains stressed out, anxious, and worrisome.
[time=1832] In fact, if you question that, just think about the fact that alcoholism and drug abuse are on the rise.
[time=1839] People attempting through various ways to numb the emotional pain that they face every single day of their lives.
[time=1847] There are also aspects of our culture that I would call entertainment seeking.
[time=1853] We're obsessed with entertainment.
[time=1855] That's why Michael Jordan can make a multi-million dollar contract and that's why Bruce Springsteen can earn 75 million dollars singing once a year or twice a year.
[time=1864] We are entertainment oriented.
[time=1867] We also have an unusual species.
[time=1870] This is found in all walks of life. It's called the workaholic.
[time=1875] I'm sure there are no workaholics here today, but there are many in our culture.
[time=1881] Obsessed with success, obsessed with becoming more successful, let's say in the corporate ladder,
[time=1887] and when they go through that process trying to get there, they experience stress.
[time=1893] And they worry, and they're anxious.
[time=1896] You know the problem of worry and anxiety and stress is not a problem that just the world experiences.
[time=1903] It's a problem that Christians alike can experience.
[time=1907] It's a problem that every single one of us from one time to another have to face.
[time=1912] We all have to face the issue of worry or anxiety.
[time=1917] We're quite subtle, however, in handling that.
[time=1919] We oftentimes explain away or rationalize away by saying it's just a concern of mine.
[time=1926] I'm not really worrying. I'm just concerned.
[time=1929] And yet what we are really trying to do is cover up the reality that we have allowed our circumstances
[time=1936] to actually become bigger than our God, and we worry.
[time=1940] There are a variety of ways in which this happens.
[time=1943] I'd like you to think about what worry is, what anxiety and what stress involves.
[time=1949] Webster has defined anxiety as the characteristic of worrying about something.
[time=1955] Being apprehensive especially about the future.
[time=1959] Do you fall in that category this morning?
[time=1962] There are a lot of ways in which that can happen.
[time=1965] Maybe you go to the end of the month, and you wonder if you're going to have enough money to make the mortgage payments that keeps coming every month.
[time=1976] Or if you're a mom who is working.
[time=1979] And you're struggling because you have to, every single day of the week, leave that child at the daycare center.
[time=1985] And you go off to your job, and you're anxious about that reality.
[time=1991] Or maybe you are suffering from a health problem.
[time=1995] Or just a variety of things that come our way in life that all have the potential for creating
[time=2001] a context where worry develops, and where anxiety occurs.
[time=2007] It's something the Christian faces.
[time=2009] Every single one of us have to battle it.
[time=2011] I have to battle it.
[time=2012] In fact, I stand before you here as one who has to deal with this issue on a regular basis.
[time=2017] I, I guess, have been described as a type A personality.
[time=2021] And so I have to fight stress and worry.
[time=2026] How do we handle situations like this?
[time=2029] How do we cope with stressful and uncertain events that come our way?
[time=2033] Many times that we don't even have any idea are going to happen.
[time=2036] But nevertheless, they are facing us.
[time=2039] The Apostle Paul had to deal with such situations.
[time=2042] In fact, he confronted and talked to a group of individuals at the Church of Philippi that I am sure likewise had to face this issue of stress and worry.
[time=2052] You see, they were concerned about Paul being imprisoned.
[time=2055] They were also facing strife within their own congregation.
[time=2059] They had false teachers from without that were coming in.
[time=2063] And there was a beautiful context specially made for worry and anxiety to begin to come about in that church.
[time=2071] The Apostle Paul in a passage that we will look at this morning addresses this issue.
[time=2077] And he tells us and answers the question, "How do we find lasting peace?" In the midst of uncertain realities and difficult experiences of life, how do I maintain or find or experience a lasting peace?
[time=2095] How do I have victory over my circumstances?
[time=2098] How do I experience the joy and the stability that comes from being very confident that God is in control and is going to move me successfully through the crises that I face?
[time=2109] What I would like us to see this morning in our passage that we will be looking at are two things.
[time=2114] First of all, I want us to notice that lasting peace is possible.
[time=2120] Lasting peace is a reality that the believer can experience.
[time=2127] But that's not all I want us to see.
[time=2129] I want us to also see that not only is lasting peace possible, but lasting peace the Apostle Paul will tell us can be found by moving into a spiritual habit that every single one of us need to be doing.
[time=2144] Let's look at our passage this morning.
[time=2146] If you haven't turned your Bible so far, turn to Philippians chapter 4 verses 6 and 7.
[time=2152] Philippians chapter 4 verses 6 and 7.
[time=2162] And what I want us to be asking ourselves this morning as we look and examine this passage is how do I find lasting peace?
[time=2177] I want to treat these verses in reverse order.
[time=2180] And I'll be reading from the NIV this morning.
[time=2183] But I first of all, in verse 7, want us to see this.
[time=2186] I want us to see that lasting peace the Apostle Paul tells us is a reality
[time=2193] that you and I as believers in Jesus Christ can experience.
[time=2198] We don't have to be overwhelmed by our circumstances.
[time=2200] We don't have to say, well, I'm just concerned when we're really worrying, but we can experience lasting peace.
[time=2208] Notice what the passage says in verse 7.
[time=2211] And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=2222] Paul describes in verse 7 a peace that is lasting, that is not temporary, that is not momentary, but it's something that is lasting for the believer.
[time=2233] He describes it through several characteristics.
[time=2236] And I want you to first notice that it is a peace that God provides.
[time=2240] Notice our verse again in verse 7.
[time=2242] And the peace of God.
[time=2246] The world says you do the things my way and you can have peace.
[time=2252] And if you watch the tube very often, you are bombarded with a philosophy of life that says if you do certain things tonight's the night, right?
[time=2262] Or buy that new car or embrace this particular value or philosophy of life
[time=2269] and then you will have arrived.
[time=2272] You will have peace.
[time=2275] You go to the university campuses and they will tell you a variety of ways you can have peace.
[time=2279] Take our new introductory TM class and you can have peace.
[time=2283] Or buy Shirley MacLaine's book out on a limb and she will tell you how you can become a part of the new age movement and experience out of the body types of realities where you can be close to God and then you will find peace.
[time=2298] But that's not the kind of peace that Paul is talking about in verse 7.
[time=2302] He's not talking about the kind of peace the world provides or which our counterfeits.
[time=2306] He talks about a peace that is lasting, that is permanent, that is not temporary.
[time=2310] It's a peace that God provides. It comes from him.
[time=2315] But secondly, there's another characteristic that Paul tells us about this peace.
[time=2319] It's a peace which exceeds human comprehension.
[time=2322] It is a peace that transcends understanding the text says.
[time=2326] It's a peace that sometimes we can't explain.
[time=2329] It's not some escape from reality. That's not what he is saying here.
[time=2333] But it's a peace that floods our souls as we allow God to take the circumstances.
[time=2339] So often we get involved with and stay in and look at instead of looking to God.
[time=2344] But we give them to God and there's a peace that comes into our lives.
[time=2347] And we sometimes just simply can't explain that.
[time=2350] We have no human explanation for it, but it's a peace that is real that God gives to us.
[time=2356] There's another characteristic. It's also a peace that prevents unnecessary anxiety.
[time=2362] Notice the text again.
[time=2365] It's a peace that will guard your hearts and your minds.
[time=2371] One of Satan's greatest strategies, it seems to me, is that he wants to put our eyes upon our circumstances and he wants to take our eyes off of our God.
[time=2383] And when our circumstances, Christian friends, get bigger than our God, that is when we worry. That's exactly what worry is, isn't it?
[time=2391] Think about that with me.
[time=2393] Isn't that worry? When we look at our circumstances, we say, God, those circumstances are too great. I want to hang on to those.
[time=2401] I want to worry about them. I want to be anxious about them.
[time=2404] I want to be stressed out about these circumstances.
[time=2407] They are too big for you, God. Let me handle them.
[time=2410] Isn't that worry? It's exactly what we're doing.
[time=2413] God becomes smaller and our circumstances become bigger.
[time=2418] That's when worry occurs. And yet the word says that when we look to God, that God's peace is that which enables us to go beyond that.
[time=2430] It's a peace that prevents unnecessary anxiety from being obsessed with circumstances.
[time=2436] But there is another aspect. In verse 7, the passage also says that this is a peace that is available to believers who know the Savior.
[time=2446] Notice, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=2456] If you are sitting here today and you know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, the Word of God very, very clearly says that this peace is available to you.
[time=2468] Because you have the necessary spiritual equipment, so to speak.
[time=2473] You have the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life that enables you to experience
[time=2479] the kind of peace that is lasting and permanent and not temporary.
[time=2484] You see, a person who doesn't know the Savior has no capacity to understand or experience
[time=2490] the kind of peace that Paul is talking about here.
[time=2493] Because there's not the necessary spiritual equipment.
[time=2496] I mean, in 2 Corinthians 2, there's going to be 1 Corinthians 2, verse 14.
[time=2500] Paul is talking about the natural man. He says the natural person or the lost person doesn't have the equipment, as it were, to understand the things of the Spirit of God because they are spiritually appraised. You need certain things spiritually to understand spiritual things and to experience this kind of peace you have to know Christ as your Savior.
[time=2522] But the question I would like to ask all of us by way of application this morning is this.
[time=2527] Do you and I possess lasting peace?
[time=2531] Or do we live in a perpetual state, week in, week out, Monday through Sunday, in a state of constant stress
[time=2542] and worry and anxiety?
[time=2546] Are we like the husband and wife where the husband and the wife have finally married off their last son?
[time=2554] And the husband leans over to his wife as they're lying in bed that night.
[time=2558] He says, "Sweetheart, guess what? Our worries are over." No longer do I have to worry about with a garage open at 2 a.m. in the morning.
[time=2568] Or will he be coming in at all hours of the night?
[time=2571] I don't have to worry about that any longer and your worries are over too sweetheart and the wife looks at him and says, "Yeah, but sweetie, I'm not happy unless I'm worrying." Is that you?
[time=2583] There are a lot of different areas in which worry can be created.
[time=2587] Which are ideal circumstances for worry. Our job.
[time=2591] When you go to that job on Monday morning, is there a boss that simply is a prime impetus for stress?
[time=2600] Or maybe a co-worker?
[time=2602] Or maybe the hours that you work?
[time=2604] Or maybe the pay that you are receiving or not receiving?
[time=2609] Or maybe parents you do struggle with your children?
[time=2615] And you're worrying and you're concerned and you're stressed out because you really have a question in your mind if they are actually going to grow up as seen individuals one day?
[time=2628] Or maybe it's a health problem.
[time=2631] Maybe you've recently had some news that is not very promising.
[time=2635] Or you're facing long-term disability.
[time=2639] Or you're facing retirement and you're not sure where the money is going to be.
[time=2643] Or maybe it's financial. Maybe you are struggling with finances in your own life and you're trying to make ends meet and the ends aren't meeting.
[time=2652] Maybe it's a relationship.
[time=2655] You're worried or you're concerned or you're stressed out if there's going to be a long-term commitment or is this person going to fly the coop one day?
[time=2662] Am I really going to get involved in this kind of relationship and commit to this thing?
[time=2665] Because I'm not sure it's going to work out and you live with a state of stress and worry and anxiety. Is that where you were living this morning?
[time=2672] There's a whole lot of experiences of life that can be prime context for stress.
[time=2678] And yet the question I would like us to address this morning is this.
[time=2683] Ultimately, how do I find peace in the midst of this?
[time=2687] How do I find peace in the midst of the uncertain circumstances that will come my way and will come your way?
[time=2694] Because if you're not going through difficult times now, I've got encouraging news for you, you will.
[time=2699] Isn't that encouraging? All of us go through difficult times of life at some time or another.
[time=2705] We see in verse 7 in Philippians that Paul has said, "He has told us that lasting peace is possible." No question about that. But here's the question.
[time=2718] In verse 6 he will ask and answer this question, "How do I find lasting peace?"
[time=2726] And what we will see in verse 6 is this, that we find lasting peace.
[time=2731] Are you listening? Through prayer.
[time=2735] Not the activity of prayer per se.
[time=2740] But what we do when we pray, that is where we find lasting peace.
[time=2747] And Paul will say you find lasting peace if you commit those cares, those stressful situations, those uncertain events of your life, to God.
[time=2758] And you allow him to become bigger than your circumstances.
[time=2763] Look at verse 7 with me. She did me verse 6.
[time=2767] Do not be anxious about anything.
[time=2771] But in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your request to God.
[time=2780] Paul commands these Philippians to commit their concerns to Christ to God.
[time=2786] You see, they're facing uncertain situations and difficulties in their own life.
[time=2790] And Paul says, "I don't want you worrying about anything." You mean, "I can't worry about anything?" What Paul says. That's what God's word says.
[time=2800] But instead, pray about everything.
[time=2803] Even that little situation in my life that nobody else knows about, nobody is very small, but tends to occupy my thought processes all throughout the week.
[time=2815] Yeah, that too.
[time=2818] Don't be anxious about anything but pray about everything.
[time=2822] And then notice what he says here.
[time=2824] Here is what we do. By prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, we present our request to God. He is the object.
[time=2833] You see, Paul is not just saying we go through this ritual of going to God and writing a few lines in prayer.
[time=2839] And then all of a sudden, we experience the peace of God.
[time=2841] That's not what he is saying here.
[time=2843] He is saying as you pray, what you are doing is you are committing your request, your concerns, your cares, your anxieties, your worries.
[time=2851] You are committing them to God, and you're leaving them there.
[time=2855] You're saying, "God, I have come to the place in my life where the circumstances are too great for me to handle. I want you to take those." You are bigger, God, than my circumstances.
[time=2864] I'm tired of saying my circumstances are bigger than you.
[time=2866] You are bigger. You're sovereign. You're good.
[time=2868] I'm committing them to you by faith, by an act of my will.
[time=2872] That's what we do in prayer.
[time=2874] It's not just the ritual of prayer.
[time=2876] It's what we do in prayer that promises us peace.
[time=2881] Paul would say in this passage very, very clearly, "How do we find lasting peace?"
[time=2887] It is when we recognize that God is bigger than any circumstance of life, Christian friend, I don't care what it is.
[time=2896] He is sovereign.
[time=2898] He is good, and he knows exactly where you are today.
[time=2903] And he is saying, "I want you to realize that I am bigger than that circumstance and through prayer, by an act of faith, commit those concerns, those anxieties,
[time=2914] those stressful events to me." That's what he wants us to do.
[time=2920] A question I would ask all of us this morning by way of application as we think about how this relates to life is, "Do you and I live in a state of perpetual anxiety because we have chosen not to commit our concerns to God through prayer?
[time=2938] Is that where we live?
[time=2941] Do we live in a state of worry?
[time=2943] Do we live in a state of utter frustration and stress?
[time=2948] Because we have chosen to take upon our own selves things that really God should be handling." That's the question I'd like to ask you.
[time=2957] I'd like you to reflect upon that.
[time=2960] The amazing thing that seems to me about this command is a command in the context of the corporate assembly, which may have implied the sharing of mutual needs and concerns
[time=2972] and then praying one for the other.
[time=2975] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2977] Gene gets in his excellent commentary called "A Profile of Christian Maturity" has said these words.
[time=2983] Since too long we have told Christians to pray about their problems in isolation.
[time=2988] This often leads to more anxiety and discouragement.
[time=2992] But mutual burden bearing and concerns help to ease the load and often bring about unusual psychological and even physical healing.
[time=3001] This implied Paul is one way to tap the peace of God, which truly transcends all understanding.
[time=3010] Paul says this, "You can have peace.
[time=3014] But you can have peace if you are willing to take the concerns of life whatever those concerns might be and entrust them to a God who is good and who is sovereign and who knows and who is omnipotent and able to take care of those circumstances." That's what he tells us and he promises.
[time=3032] The word says the peace of God will flood your soul
[time=3038] if you'll simply do that.
[time=3041] There are many events in life and some represent minor things
[time=3048] and yet they create opportunities to experience worry.
[time=3052] They create opportunities for stress.
[time=3055] And so oftentimes we try to figure these things out ourselves, don't we?
[time=3059] We've got to rationally work through the problem or try to look at all the facts
[time=3065] and see if we can come up with a solution in our own strength.
[time=3069] But there are simply events that will come into our lives that we have no rational nor logical thought process suitable to solve.
[time=3077] I think David experienced this in Psalm 13.
[time=3081] When he says, "Lord, how long will you hide your face from me forever?"
[time=3088] You ever felt like God was hiding his face from you?
[time=3090] How long will you forget about me, O Lord?
[time=3092] You ever felt like he's forgotten about you?
[time=3096] And then David says, "I counseled within my own soul all the day long."
[time=3102] And basically what David is saying is this.
[time=3105] I looked within my own life.
[time=3107] I tried to find a solution to the problem and I came up exactly where I suppose I...
[time=3115] If I had thought about it, I would have ended up and that as I came up absolutely empty.
[time=3120] No solution, no problem.
[time=3123] And then this is though God is tapping David on the shoulder.
[time=3126] David, here I am.
[time=3128] Here I am.
[time=3130] And then in verses 5 and 6 of Psalm 13, David looks to God and says, "But now I will rejoice in the God of my deliverance, my salvation."
[time=3142] And David came to a place where every single one of us need to come in the midst of the crisis, where we recognize we have no solutions within our own soul.
[time=3150] God never intended us to bear those burdens and we give those burdens to God.
[time=3155] We cast our anxiety upon him as Peter says.
[time=3158] Why? Because he cares for us.
[time=3163] Most of us tend to worry far, far too much.
[time=3169] And I suppose in the auditorium this size, as you came in this morning, there are many of you that are carrying burdens that are very, very great.
[time=3178] There are many of you that are carrying situations around in your life that are very, very stressful.
[time=3184] And what we see in our passage this morning is this.
[time=3187] While the world says and screams to us, you come and do it our way and you will find peace.
[time=3194] I'm here to tell you that kind of peace is very temporary.
[time=3198] Sure, you might find a quick fix, you might feel better quick, but that might not be God's ideal.
[time=3206] You see God wants to provide a peace that is long lasting.
[time=3210] He wants to provide a peace that is permanent, that is not temporary.
[time=3215] And what we have seen in our passage very clearly this morning is this, that that kind of peace is available.
[time=3220] It's available to every single one of us sitting here today, but we have some decisions to make.
[time=3227] The question we have tried to ask and answer from our passage this morning is a very simple question, "How do I find lasting peace? How do I, in the midst of uncertain circumstances of life, experience that stability
[time=3241] that gives me the confidence that God is going to move me successfully through that crisis?" And what we have seen is this, that peace is possible if we will take our concerns and turn them over to God.
[time=3256] Easy to say, so often difficult to do.
[time=3261] If you're sitting here this morning and you have never trusted Jesus Christ as your Savior, the question is still the same for you, how do I find lasting peace?
[time=3270] In the midst of a world that is filled with crises and uncertain situations and unexpected tragedies,
[time=3278] it's by realizing that Jesus Christ is down across for sinners.
[time=3283] It's by also recognizing that you have a need for a Savior.
[time=3287] If you would but recognize that and acknowledge the fact that Christ is down across for sinners like you and like me,
[time=3294] you can accept Him today as your personal Savior, and He promises that He will give you the peace of God in eternal life.
[time=3302] If you're sitting here today and you're a Christian, the question we have asked is, "How do I find lasting peace?"
[time=3309] And what we have said is this, is that we take our concerns.
[time=3313] We take our stressful events of life.
[time=3318] We take those experiences and those situations that sometimes are overwhelming, that burden us,
[time=3325] and that we have carried around ourselves, and we finally acknowledge the fact that God is bigger than any circumstance of life, whatever that might be.
[time=3335] And we say, "God, it's yours." I'm tired of handling this myself.
[time=3342] I'm tired of facing that job in the flesh.
[time=3345] I'm tired of trying to handle that health problem on strength.
[time=3348] I'm tired of handling that relationship problem week in, week out in my own strengths and efforts.
[time=3354] God, it's yours.
[time=3355] I'm turning it over to you because you are sovereign, you are good, and God, you are able to handle it.
[time=3364] There's a hymn that we sing.
[time=3367] You know it.
[time=3368] It's called "Leaving It All With Jesus." I can listen to the words.
[time=3373] "My heart has come to the place of rest, leaving it all with Jesus.
[time=3378] The cares of life, death no more and less.
[time=3382] I'm leaving it all with Jesus.
[time=3384] Leaving it all with Jesus, leaving it all with Jesus.
[time=3389] My peace today, as on yesterday, is leaving it all with Jesus."
[time=3399] As we close this morning, my application will be very general to you, and that is this.
[time=3404] What are you struggling with this morning?
[time=3407] What is it?
[time=3409] Is it your job?
[time=3412] Is it a relationship?
[time=3415] Is the child?
[time=3418] Is the parent?
[time=3420] Is it school?
[time=3422] Is it finances?
[time=3425] Is it a physical problem?
[time=3427] You see, across this auditorium, we have many people, and for every single person, there are unique events of life that you personally are struggling with, and let me simply say this to you.
[time=3439] Any situation that we come into in life are potential areas where we can begin to take our eyes off of God and put them on our circumstances, and that leads to worry.
[time=3452] But we have seen very clearly that God wants to provide lasting peace in any situation of life, and what he simply wants us to do is this.
[time=3461] To take our eyes off of our circumstances and to find the peace of God by putting them in God's hands.
[time=3469] That's where they need to be.
[time=3471] Let's pray together.
[time=3489] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and soloist, Kerry Johnson and Teresa Rust.
[time=3496] The message today was from our guest pastor, Tracy Howard, who's the pastor of the Grace Bible Church in Burn, Indiana.
[time=3503] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3508] Just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3513] Thank you, Heavenly Father. I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3520] And I know today that I'm a sinner, and I want Christ to come in and to cleanse me of my sin and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3528] I ask you to come into my heart today.
[time=3531] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3534] If you prayed that prayer this morning, would you write us and tell us the decision that you made?
[time=3539] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
