[time=109] Some of the greatest needs in life are often unfelt or
[time=115] unidentified needs. At this very moment, you could have a malignant cancer cell growing in your body that will soon take your life. You don't know that it's there, but the greatest need of your life is to have it removed.
[time=131] Spiritually, the greatest need in our life is often unfelt.
[time=136] That need is to be reconciled to God. On his deathbed, Henry
[time=143] David Thoreau was asked, "Have you made your peace with God?" And Thoreau answered, "I didn't know that we had ever quarreled." Unfortunately, he was unaware of his greatest spiritual need to be reconciled to God.
[time=161] (music)
[time=174] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=176] Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled "Peace with God." Many of us are so pressured with the stress and strain of each day that we felt and recognize some of our greatest needs. Often, we allow our health to slip or neglect our family and perhaps ignore our spiritual needs.
[time=192] Today's message addresses our greatest spiritual need to be reconciled with God. We invite you to join us in our study of Colossians, chapter 1, verses 21 through 23. The message is entitled "Peace with God." The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song. Other special music includes a solo from Kathy Hawks, Rejoice, and Dave Miller. The Bible
[time=220] Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort White, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time. We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you. Now here's Rick.
[time=233] It's a joy to welcome you this morning to this service and to our friends who are joining us by way of television. We want to welcome you to our services as well. It's always a privilege to stand here, but particularly today. We had a delightful two weeks in Jamaica and we're looking forward today, tonight, and in the coming weeks to tell you about that great adventure, but to stand here today and to know that Jesus Christ's power is working in this church and in a new church in Jamaica, what a joy it is to worship such a God. A God who would make a pathway available to us, a pathway that would go from our life wherever it is into his kingdom, and that pathway is the cross of his son, Jesus Christ. The pathway to his kingdom is the cross.
[time=309] And the Christ is fully paid. The final payment has been made.
[time=322] And the gateway to his kingdom is the cross of Christ.
[time=331] Some say his kingdom can be reached through the doctrine that we
[time=339] teach or by the way. We have to hold this passing stage on the
[time=350] truth that God reveals. The only truth that fully heals remains
[time=359] the same. From age to endless age. The gateway to his kingdom is a
[time=374] cross of Christ. The only place of entrance for the loss of us.
[time=387] And the Christ is fully paid. The final payment has been made.
[time=396] And the gateway to his kingdom is a cross of us.
[time=405] Some say this kingdom you can find through the inside of your
[time=413] mind, or by the source of power you can find within.
[time=423] The only power you can play is the power of Jesus name.
[time=432] He alone can offer pardon for your sin.
[time=443] The gateway to his kingdom is the cross of Christ.
[time=452] The only place of entrance for the loss of us.
[time=461] And the Christ is fully paid. The final payment has been made.
[time=470] And the gateway to his kingdom is a cross of Christ.
[time=482] The gateway to his kingdom is a cross of entrance for the loss.
[time=494] And the only place of entrance for the loss of us.
[time=507] And the Christ is fully paid. The final payment has been made.
[time=519] And the gateway to his kingdom is a cross of us.
[time=548] There's a cross.
[time=560] The banner of the cross leads home.
[time=566] That's the way of salvation and the promise of eternal life.
[time=570] Continue with music singing 623.
[time=573] We'll sing the first, third and fourth stanzas of that hymn, 623.
[time=578] [MUSIC]
[time=596] There is a royal banner given for his way to the soldiers of the king.
[time=604] As he wins and very minted up together, while his hands and arms we sing.
[time=613] Arching up, arching on, Lord Christ, have everything to cause.
[time=621] And to proud him in, toar and sing, give the banner of the cross.
[time=632] Climb and sing, there, there, there, there, there, there.
[time=636] In the glorious shining sun of the crimson banner.
[time=643] Now the stories tell, while the Lord shall claim his soul.
[time=649] Arching on, arching on, Lord Christ, have everything to cause.
[time=658] And to proud him in, for and sing, give the banner of the cross.
[time=668] When the glory comes, he is drawing bearing in, he is facing gave our day.
[time=677] And before our King of those who disappear, and the cross of world shall swing.
[time=686] Arching on, arching on, Lord Christ, have everything to cause.
[time=695] And to proud him in, for and sing, give the banner of the cross.
[time=708] There's a great excitement around our church today as yesterday, last evening.
[time=712] A group from Jamaica returned and we can already feel that excitement that they have.
[time=717] And throughout the coming days, we'll hear of reports about the two weeks that they spend in Jamaica.
[time=722] We welcome back Pastor Rick and his wife Kathy.
[time=725] Kathy is going to sing for us right now, and let's listen to her ministry as she sings.
[time=732] Children lift our voices, children lift our voices, children lift our voices.
[time=740] And the Father has provided our day.
[time=749] There is a bondage from Egypt's mighty hand.
[time=755] Israel's children sought the promise land.
[time=760] Pursued by Pharaoh's army, they faced mighty sea.
[time=766] A place where only God could set them free.
[time=771] And in the waters divided, and the sea turned into land.
[time=777] And they knew God had provided once again.
[time=782] So children lift your voices.
[time=785] For the Father has provided again all the earthly choices.
[time=790] For the Father has provided again and I know that he's able, I know, my every need he'll supply.
[time=800] Out of his boundless riches, the Father has provided again.
[time=809] If you've thrown into your presence, I seek to understand the wonder and the mystery of your plan.
[time=820] How could a crucifixion result in life for me?
[time=826] And how could a cross that bound you set me free?
[time=831] And in the heavens divided, and I saw your nails start hands.
[time=837] And I knew you had provided once again.
[time=842] So now children lift your voices.
[time=845] For the Father has provided again all the earthly choices.
[time=851] For the Father has provided again and I know that he's able, I know, my every need he'll supply.
[time=861] Out of his boundless riches, the Father has provided again.
[time=868] Children lift your voices.
[time=870] For the Father has provided again all the earthly choices.
[time=876] For the Father has provided again and I know that he's able, I know, my every need he'll supply.
[time=886] Out of his boundless riches, the Father has provided again.
[time=895] For the Father has provided again.
[time=903] We'll find it again.
[time=912] Thank you, and Jamaica they call that putting your hands together.
[time=916] Whenever you clap you put your hands together.
[time=920] And also in Jamaica we have church in the streets in front of a store.
[time=925] And whenever they're done, whether you're done or not, they just get in their truck and drive through the meeting.
[time=929] What would be the third row of the church and they leave?
[time=932] So you can beat Jamaican and clap, but please don't drive your truck through our church today.
[time=937] We're going to take the moments that we usually work on scripture memory just to give you one word of encouragement about our ministry team to Jamaica.
[time=945] It looks like as I read the clock up there, it's about 11, 15, and church is probably just ending right now at a place called New Forest, Jamaica.
[time=956] New Forest is a little rural area where there was no church two weeks ago.
[time=961] Part of our team went in there and they held meetings every night for a week.
[time=965] Just going house to house, maybe it's better put dog to dog in Jamaica because at each house there's a dog who encourages you to keep moving.
[time=973] But they would go from dog to dog inviting people to a meeting.
[time=977] It doesn't look like there's many people in that area, but at nighttime at times over a hundred people would come.
[time=983] A hundred adults and children to these evening concerts and films and testimonies and many of them received the Lord.
[time=991] Then on Sunday morning, last week a church service was held.
[time=995] Many of them are farmers and Sundays just another work day, but 35 adults came on that first Sunday.
[time=1001] And we changed strategies on them.
[time=1004] No longer the singing, no longer the films, nothing that would be of that attraction other than did they really want to know God's word.
[time=1012] And we began a Bible study.
[time=1014] The first night of the Bible study, this little room that we're in, there were no seats.
[time=1019] So they had to stand for an hour and 20 of them studied God's word for an hour.
[time=1024] When they come back the next night after an hour long Bible study, they came back night after night to the last night.
[time=1031] 28 adults studying God's word in a dark room hungry to see the light.
[time=1037] That's just one of three ministry teams that took place.
[time=1041] And this morning Larry Smith was holding church services in New Forest, Jamaica, where there was never a church before.
[time=1050] 31 people had the privilege of going, but they were no more vital or significant than those of you who were partners through your giving.
[time=1059] As you give regularly to the church, $6,000 of our missions budget went towards the Jamaica project.
[time=1066] You participated. Many of you gave extra over and above to support team members and you're just as vital as they were.
[time=1075] And then many of you prayed and your ministry was the most significant.
[time=1080] My heart was so touched this morning as I walked into a building.
[time=1084] This church and a friend stuck out his hands and said, Rick, I'm glad you're back.
[time=1089] I prayed for you every day.
[time=1092] You see, the power that this church has is not the resources of people, not the resources of fun, not the resources of buildings, not the resources of television.
[time=1105] It's the power of prayer.
[time=1108] And that changes lives and builds churches and we can't wait to tell you more.
[time=1114] I'm going to ask our ladies to come now, a musical group called Rejoice.
[time=1126] And as they sing the words of their song, remind us again that God loves us and that he has a plan of forgiveness.
[time=1134] And there's no greater love than this than that God gave his son Jesus Christ for you, for me, for Jamaica.
[time=1145] There is no greater love than this than a man should give his life to save another.
[time=1170] There is no greater love than this, no greater love than this.
[time=1180] Make me willing, Lord, a peace to all my brother.
[time=1192] In knowing, or in giving, in dying or in living, I'll try to show the world it has a prayer.
[time=1213] By praying and by caring, by reaching out and sharing, the love of Christ will go on without Him, without Him.
[time=1239] There is no greater love than this, no greater love than this.
[time=1251] There is no greater love than this, no greater love than this, no greater love than this.
[time=1271] There is no greater love than this, no greater love than this.
[time=1300] We welcome you today to the Bible Hour. It's a particular delight for me to be here. Having spent the last two Sundays in Jamaica, it is good to be home.
[time=1311] Well, Rick, we enjoyed the reports that you gave us throughout the last two weeks of your activities in Jamaica, but we're glad to that you're home.
[time=1319] People are anxious to see you again this morning, I'm sure.
[time=1322] 31 of us who went will probably need more than two weeks to tell all the exciting things that happened during our brief 14-day stay.
[time=1331] But many of you prayed for us, and I want to begin by thanking you for that ministry, and just report briefly to you that your prayers indeed were answered.
[time=1340] We had the privilege of having three services a day during our stay in Jamaica at three different churches, actually only at two churches, and then one of the services would be out at what we called a storefront.
[time=1351] It's very unusual to think that you might go up to a dairy store and say to the manager, "Could we have a meeting tonight in front of your store?"
[time=1359] But that's what we did, and we had as many as 100 people, some nights, come to those storefront meetings.
[time=1366] And over the time that we were there, we literally saw more than 100 people come to know Christ as their Savior.
[time=1373] And most exciting to us is there is now a new church established where there was not one so that many of these new converts can begin worshiping the Lord.
[time=1383] Well, that's going to be exciting for our entire church to hear that so many people knew and accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior.
[time=1390] And then so many times as we're giving in our missionary offerings, it's important for us to know that our money is being used in a way that's really significant, and in this case in Jamaica.
[time=1401] It really is, and we want to thank you for your partnership and prayer.
[time=1406] And those of you who gave to Jamaica 88, we doubly appreciate your help.
[time=1411] And I know that we cannot convey to you all of the joy, all of the excitement, but hope that we can share enough of it with you to keep you encouraged to the day we get to heaven.
[time=1422] And somebody walks up to you who you've never met before and says, "Now that I'm in heaven, God has told me everything."
[time=1429] And I understand you're one of the people that made it possible for me to be here in this eternal kingdom.
[time=1434] And they put their arms around you and embrace you and call your brother or sister, and together you serve the Lord forever in heaven.
[time=1442] What a day that will be.
[time=1444] But until then, each of us have the privilege and the responsibility of being steadfast and faithful.
[time=1450] And we want to thank you for your partnership in the gospel through the Bible hour as it reaches out into your community and ours.
[time=1457] We do want to invite you to a coming event. If you're here in Fort Wayne, it's today.
[time=1462] If you're watching in another city, it's a little bit of a drive.
[time=1465] But today, as you watch the broadcast, it is July the 3rd, and we have our patriotic panorama.
[time=1472] Yes, Rick, we've been announcing for several weeks the picnic and then the program that we'll be having outdoors this week today.
[time=1480] And there's no ticket necessary for the concert. It's at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
[time=1485] We'll have the king's brass here and we'll have the sanctuary choir singing.
[time=1489] It's going to be a festive event and very relaxing.
[time=1493] So bring your blanket and lawn chair and just enjoy yourselves at 4 o'clock. That's July 3rd.
[time=1500] Well, we do hope that you'll come.
[time=1502] We're recording this one week early. It was 106 here in Fort Wayne yesterday.
[time=1508] But we hope by July the 3rd is you're watching it.
[time=1511] It's a lovely 75-degree day with a gentle breeze and you can come and join us.
[time=1517] We have a booklet to share with you that is a booklet.
[time=1520] If you don't need it today, you will. And if you need it today, we want to send it to you quickly so you can have it.
[time=1528] If you don't feel like you need it today, I hope you'll write because you don't know when the day will come
[time=1534] when you need to know about grief's healing process.
[time=1538] Rick, that's the booklet that we introduced the first week that you were gone.
[time=1542] And this is understanding and accepting God's healing process and the loss that you have.
[time=1548] And we want to encourage everyone to write for this.
[time=1552] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1561] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1569] You know, Rick, when circumstances come into our life and we can do a lot, but the real comfort comes from God.
[time=1576] And that's what this book suggests and encourages us to really lean on the Lord when that unusual loss or circumstance takes place in our lives.
[time=1585] And it always comes in the words of the Lord like a thief in the night.
[time=1589] You don't know when tragedy is going to strike, but you can have your heart prepared not only for the joys, but for the trials of the Christian life.
[time=1598] We do hope that you'll write and we'll be glad to send you a copy of that booklet.
[time=1602] Before we go back to the live part of our Morning Worship Service, I would like to invite you to join us Wednesday night, July the 6th for our summer Bible Conference.
[time=1612] We'll be having as our guest speaker that evening, Dr. George Sweeting.
[time=1617] I'm sure he needs no introduction to many of you.
[time=1620] Dr. Sweeting was for many years the President of Moody Bible Institute, that great lighthouse of God's Word in Chicago, Illinois, and also as the home of WMBI and a whole chain of Moody Network radio stations
[time=1635] that powerfully declare the Word of God.
[time=1638] Dr. Sweeting is no longer the President, he's the Chancellor, he's still working with the school, but he's out speaking God's Word of the privilege of having him here July the 6th and hope you will join us.
[time=1651] We hope also that you'll take the time to write us and let us know, perhaps that you've made a decision to receive Christ as your Savior, or that you've grown significantly through your study of God's Word with us.
[time=1663] Please do write today to request the booklet or to let us know of the effect of this ministry in your life.
[time=1670] Again, our address is the Bible Hour 7400 East State Boulevard,
[time=1678] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1683] Thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=1700] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1710] We hope you'll take the time to write us and let us know.
[time=1718] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=1724] In His image, God created man.
[time=1732] So man became the voice that God would use to sing the song.
[time=1741] A song of joy, a song of love, of knowing we belong.
[time=1749] We'll sing of truth and brotherhood, of peace and unity.
[time=1757] We'll sing the song that all God's children sing.
[time=1766] One song with one voice, from one heart, like a mighty chorus to one Lord.
[time=1787] One face, one God and father of a song.
[time=1800] And the music He created rings throughout the land.
[time=1808] From mountains high to the valleys deep, overseas and desert sands.
[time=1816] Touching hearts and changing lies, the song rings loud and clear.
[time=1824] We'll sing it out for everyone to hear.
[time=1832] We'll sing one song with one voice, from one heart, like a mighty chorus to one Lord.
[time=1853] One face, one God and father of a song.
[time=1868] We'll sing one song with one voice, from one heart, like a mighty chorus to one Lord.
[time=1889] One face, one God and father of a song.
[time=1922] Many of you do not know Dave, but Dave and Peggy Miller were active part of the Black Hawk
[time=1935] family here during the 70s and around 1981 they moved away to Minnesota but are good friends
[time=1942] of many of us here and come back almost every year and we love to invite them to sing and
[time=1948] are thankful for his ministry today.
[time=1950] If you have your Bible I invite you to open it to the book of Colossians.
[time=1954] I have heard such good encouraging reports about Jim Pearson, Steve Longbreak and Tracy
[time=1961] Howard's ministry while I was gone and thankful for those godly men and their preparedness of walk and of words to share with you and I counted a double privilege to be back home
[time=1972] and in this place again to share God's word with you.
[time=1976] We had been studying before I left the book of Colossians and today we'll study Colossians chapter 1 verses 21 through 23.
[time=1985] If you see a friend near you who does not have a Bible, please offer yours to them that you could share it across labs that we could study God's word together.
[time=1995] This is Colossians chapter 1 verse 21 through 23 reads like this, "Once you were alienated
[time=2004] from God and were enemies in your minds because of evil behavior, but now he has reconciled
[time=2013] you by Christ's physical body through death to present you wholly in his sight, without
[time=2023] blemish and free from accusation.
[time=2027] If you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out
[time=2036] in the gospel, this is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every
[time=2042] creature under heaven and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
[time=2051] Sometimes in life our greatest need goes unnoticed and undetected.
[time=2058] At this very moment it is possible that you have one tiny malignant cancerous cell in
[time=2064] your body.
[time=2065] It is undetected, it is unnoticed, but that one cell could grow and expand and then metastasize
[time=2074] and become the source of your premature death in but a few months.
[time=2081] It's a great need, but it's unnoticed and undetected.
[time=2088] In the same way we have a great need, but it's unnoticed and undetected in many of
[time=2094] our lives spiritually.
[time=2096] It is the need to be reconciled to God.
[time=2101] When Henry David Thoreau was approaching his death, a friend said to him, "Have you made
[time=2108] your peace with God?" And Thoreau responded, "I didn't know that we had ever quarreled."
[time=2116] Woody is that may sound, it reflects the fact that many of us do not know of the greatest
[time=2122] spiritual need and that is the need of reconciliation.
[time=2128] All of this world is in desperate need of reconciliation.
[time=2132] The races, black and white, Asian and African, every race is in need of reconciliation.
[time=2142] I was walking through a village called Bolcevanna.
[time=2146] Now in Bolcevanna, Jamaica, you could look in every direction and not see more than maybe
[time=2152] 50 homes.
[time=2154] You are in the remote part of the bush.
[time=2159] We're walking up this hill in Bolcevanna and I'm talking with this man about spiritual things.
[time=2165] He's a very uneducated man.
[time=2167] He does not have a newspaper, he does not have a television set.
[time=2170] He probably has the equivalent to what we would consider a third-grade education.
[time=2175] We're walking up the hill and he uses English and another language called Patuan.
[time=2179] I could not always understand him, but as we're walking up the hill, he says, "What do you think of apartheid?" And I thought I heard the word apartheid, but I said, "Wait a minute, I'm in the middle of nowhere." This guy is asking me about politics halfway around the world.
[time=2194] He must have said something that I didn't understand, so I said, "Again, please." He said, "What do you think of apartheid in South Africa?" Well, he's pleased to know of my feelings, but I was shocked.
[time=2205] We're halfway around the world and about as remote a location as you can get and this man wants to know how we feel about the need for reconciliation between black men and white men, and it underscored the need for reconciliation in our world.
[time=2221] When the Reagan administration comes to an end, without a doubt, historians will laud his greatest accomplishments as the summits between Reagan and Gorbachev, because there
[time=2233] is an urgent sense of need for reconciliation between these two super nations that have the
[time=2239] colossal destructive abilities, and can they somehow be reconciled and be brought to peaceful
[time=2248] coexistence, the races, the nations.
[time=2255] But even within a nation, we are a nation in desperate need of reconciliation from one
[time=2261] another.
[time=2262] Our courts are overloaded and swamped with one American suing another American.
[time=2270] Last year, over a billion dollars went from one person's hands to another person's hands
[time=2276] as liability and reconciliation payment for perceived losses, and in those thousands and
[time=2283] thousands of court cases, you know that in every one of those court cases, the same person won in the same person lost, every time a lawyer won and every time we lost.
[time=2297] You know there are doctors in our church who in order to have liability insurance, there
[time=2304] are premiums, and there are good doctors who may have never even had a claim.
[time=2310] Their premiums exceed $100,000 a year.
[time=2316] That's why every time you go to the doctor and I go to the doctor, the bill seems to get higher and higher.
[time=2322] Those people have to make $100,000 just to pay for the possibility that somebody may take
[time=2329] advantage of a suit.
[time=2332] We're a nation in need of reconciliation.
[time=2336] Not only are we a nation but our families, in the year 1985, for every 1,000 Americans,
[time=2346] there were ten marriages and five divorces.
[time=2352] We are families in desperate need of reconciliation.
[time=2359] And we are not only families, we are individuals who are need to be reconciled to ourself.
[time=2367] There is a term called cognitive dissonance.
[time=2371] It describes the individual who believes two things about themselves that are not compatible.
[time=2380] They want to believe that I'm a good person, I'm moral and I'm upright but they know about their own sin.
[time=2388] But on the inside, there is a frustration because their belief about themselves as being good
[time=2394] is being attacked by the reality that they know they've done wrong.
[time=2398] And there is a God-given commodity that springs up called guilt.
[time=2402] And when guilt goes unresolved, we have to find a way of being reconciled to ourself.
[time=2410] Individuals, families, peoples, nations, the races of the world are desperately needing reconciliation and it all stems back to the fact that we must be reconciled to God before
[time=2424] I can ever be reconciled with myself.
[time=2427] And how can I be reconciled with my family if I can't cope with me?
[time=2431] And how can I cope with all of you if I can't cope with Rachel and Rebecca and Adam and Kathy and if a family can't cope, how can a nation survive?
[time=2441] And if this nation is just one cluster of guilt, frustrated, alienated people, how do we find
[time=2447] peace across the globe?
[time=2451] Greatest need is reconciliation.
[time=2454] That is the theme of these few verses that we're studying today.
[time=2459] Quickly, what does the word "reconciled" mean?
[time=2462] Well you may use that when you get your statement from the bank and they've given you a print out of your account and it says you have this much money and according to your checkbook ledger that you updated last year at this time and now you brought that forward, you look and your number doesn't match their number.
[time=2481] The numbers somehow have to be changed to match.
[time=2487] Either the banks got to change their number, good luck, or you've got to change your number.
[time=2493] One of the two has to change for a reconciliation to take place.
[time=2499] The word "reconciled" means exactly that to change and it has a little proclinic, a
[time=2506] little adjective stuck on the front of it, kata, which means thoroughly.
[time=2511] So the word "reconciled" means to take an individual and to change them thoroughly.
[time=2517] One of the joy it was, one of the men in our group has the gift of evangelism and out
[time=2523] of sincerity this man in our group shared Christ I think with everything that moved.
[time=2531] And the very first morning I look out of our window and they have a pool there at this
[time=2537] motel we stayed but before you get jealous most of your bathtubs are bigger but they did have a pool and there was a man whose responsibility was to clean that pool.
[time=2548] And on the very first morning there one of our men shared Jesus Christ with Lloyd.
[time=2555] Lloyd accepted Christ and Lloyd brought somebody back the next morning and the next morning and Lloyd was becoming somebody who was drawing other hotel employees to this man who could
[time=2567] tell him about Christ.
[time=2569] He was reading his Bible, he was doing his Bible study.
[time=2572] On the last day we were there, Kathy said, Lloyd when did you accept Christ?
[time=2577] The question would be would there be clarity of testimony?
[time=2581] Or was he just caught up in 31 strange people saying things and with clarity Lloyd looked
[time=2587] across the pool and he pointed to Brian and he said I accepted Christ when that man right
[time=2594] there told me about Jesus and my wife can see the change, my wife can see the change.
[time=2606] That's what the word reconciled means, it's when God thoroughly changes a life.
[time=2617] Now in this passage let me give you four aspects of reconciliation.
[time=2623] First of all the Apostle Paul here states the need for reconciliation.
[time=2628] Notice verse 21 it says once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your mind because
[time=2636] of evil behavior.
[time=2639] Many of us today because of our sophistication of society, because of our felt sense of morality
[time=2646] and because of the traditional allegiance we have played to God often fail like Thoreau
[time=2652] to see that we are in a need to be reconciled.
[time=2658] This passage gives us two reasons why we need to be reconciled.
[time=2663] First of all it says because we were alienated from God.
[time=2668] The word alienate means obviously to be an alien, someone who is different, someone who
[time=2675] does not belong.
[time=2679] Now in Jamaica there are not racial problems and it's a delightful place to believe.
[time=2686] But we had an experience one night that made me feel very much like an alien.
[time=2692] Jay Howell and I had taken a car and we drove on the left hand side of the street which is the right way to drive in Jamaica.
[time=2700] They know nothing else about driving.
[time=2703] It's more like dodgems at Cedar Point but we had worked our way through town.
[time=2707] It's about 11 o'clock at night and we go out to a part of town we never have been before.
[time=2712] We take a young lady to her brother's house where five miles from any place or anything we know we drop her off we get in the car and the battery is dead.
[time=2722] You'd have been proud of Jay and I, two very brave men holding hands walking up the hill
[time=2729] on this foreign country.
[time=2733] I never felt like such an alien in my life.
[time=2738] And there's an expression they say in Jamaica that everybody says about everything that I somehow did not feel at that moment.
[time=2746] The expression is no problem, Mon.
[time=2749] We had big problems.
[time=2751] We were lost in a foreign country with no car and I never felt I was over here and everybody
[time=2760] else was over there and there was this deep sense of alienation and that's how you and
[time=2768] I stand with God.
[time=2771] We are alienated.
[time=2773] There is a gulf.
[time=2774] We are separated.
[time=2776] We are the odd man out, aliens and not only aliens, secondly our need for reconciliation
[time=2786] is because we are enemy aliens.
[time=2791] Even though we may pay casual tribute to God and attend church services, the Bible says
[time=2797] that we are actually enemies of God.
[time=2803] Not that you may have ever attacked him, you may have never denied him, but we are enemies of God it says because of our minds and because of evil behavior.
[time=2816] Let me draw two applications from that.
[time=2818] First of all, this tells us a great deal about human behavior, that sin is not only those
[time=2824] things that you and I say or do that are wrong, but sin is a part of the cognitive person.
[time=2831] We often describe the inner man or the inner woman with two various terms, either to speak
[time=2837] of its mind by mean of intellect or of its heart by mean of volition and emotion.
[time=2845] But all of that refers to the inner person and the Bible here tells us that our alienation
[time=2852] or separation from God and our enmity with God begins with the inner man.
[time=2860] Jeremiah the prophet said the heart of man is desperately wicked, who can know it?
[time=2866] Jesus said it is out of the heart of man that springs every unclean thing and the inside
[time=2872] man is the sinful man.
[time=2876] And based upon what is inside of me, that is what comes out and leads to sin on the outside.
[time=2884] There are three levels of behavior.
[time=2886] There is attitudinal behavior, how you think.
[time=2891] There is verbal behavior, what you say, and there is active behavior, what you do.
[time=2899] So you see you could be an individual who, in terms of external behavior, they are conforming to the more age of society and maybe even to biblical standards.
[time=2909] And maybe by their lips they are saying I believe in God, I believe in church, I believe in Abraham Lincoln, and they all hold the same value.
[time=2918] But on the inside there is not a heart that says God, I recognize I am a sinner and I ask your forgiveness.
[time=2927] You've seen it in your children.
[time=2929] You can say to your children, I want you to go upstairs and clean your room.
[time=2934] And they may disobey you in active behavior and not do it.
[time=2939] Or they may do it and you may hear how they feel about doing that.
[time=2944] It's called verbal behavior.
[time=2946] Are they may never say a word, they may go clean up your room, but you need to turn on the heat because the chill of their looks and their attitude is freezing.
[time=2960] God says our person is involved here.
[time=2965] And while you may be able to sit here today and compare yourself to this one or that one say, I didn't do that and I never did that.
[time=2973] God says but in your heart, in your mind, in that inner man, you are already an enemy.
[time=2980] Let me draw a second application from this.
[time=2982] This one far more academic.
[time=2985] In the year 1225, a man by the name of Thomas Aquinas was born.
[time=2990] He lived to 1275 and he was a great thinker.
[time=2994] But St. Thomas began to teach something that no one had ever taught before.
[time=2998] It was named after him, "Tomestic Thinking." St. Thomas said that when man fell, his body fell and his soul fell, but his mind did not.
[time=3009] Now, when we mean the fall, we're saying God created Adam and Eve at this level of perfection.
[time=3016] And when they sinned, they fell to a low level.
[time=3021] We believe that when they fell, they fell totally.
[time=3026] Their body became marked by sin and it dies.
[time=3030] Their minds became marked by sin and they cannot reason all that God would want us to reason.
[time=3036] Their minds became volatile and fallen and every part has fallen.
[time=3042] St. Thomas Aquinas taught that no, the spirit fell and the body fell, but the mind did not.
[time=3049] Therefore, by man's reason, he can reason his way to God.
[time=3053] It's called scholasticism.
[time=3056] But St. Thomas was wrong.
[time=3057] The Bible says our minds are fallen.
[time=3060] In our mind, there is already enmity with God and alienation.
[time=3068] By the words total depravity, we don't mean you are as rotten as you could be.
[time=3072] Now, some are, but not all of us.
[time=3075] The word total depravity means that every part of you has fallen.
[time=3080] Mind, emotion, intellect, volition, body, we are sinful in every way.
[time=3087] That constitutes our need to be reconciled to God.
[time=3092] Secondly, he gives us the means of reconciliation.
[time=3096] Verse 21 gives us the need once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your
[time=3102] minds because of evil behavior.
[time=3104] Now, secondly in verse 22, the means.
[time=3106] But now he has reconciled you by Christ, physical body through death.
[time=3114] Now there's a redundancy there, it says physical body.
[time=3117] Do you have a body that's not physical?
[time=3121] But he had a purpose in that.
[time=3123] There were a group of people that are called docetics in Paul's day and they taught that Jesus did not have a body.
[time=3130] He only appeared to have a body and they denied the deity of Christ in a human body.
[time=3137] And the Bible says this is how you will know the spirit of Antichrist.
[time=3140] If any man denies Jesus Christ is coming to flesh.
[time=3146] These people were denying that Christ had a body.
[time=3149] They said he only appeared Greek word docetics, docetics they are called.
[time=3155] Paul corrects that and he says no, you are reconciled by Christ, physical body, dying
[time=3163] on the cross.
[time=3166] There is no other plan of reconciliation.
[time=3169] You may have attended another meeting somewhere, watched another religious broadcast and we do not try to pit us and them but can I simply declare to you the scriptures that tell us
[time=3179] that Jesus Christ death is the only plan that God has for reconciliation.
[time=3184] There will be one who will come along and say no, all you need to do is obey the Ten Commandments.
[time=3191] You won't.
[time=3192] But if you did, you're still an enemy in your mind.
[time=3196] Death of Christ is the only plan God has for reconciliation.
[time=3200] Somebody else may say if you just join our church, you can join the hundred churches.
[time=3204] You can join this one and we can't reconcile you to God because the wages of sin is death and only Jesus' blood can wash away sin.
[time=3213] All precious is that flow that washes white as snow, nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=3221] There will always be someone who will tell you this will work and it won't.
[time=3224] You ever watch those commercials?
[time=3226] They show you the credit card and they say this is recognized worldwide.
[time=3232] They show you the travelers check and they tell you don't leave home without it.
[time=3236] Let me tell you about those things that you don't leave home without and are recognized worldwide.
[time=3241] In both Savannah and Jamaica, they've never seen either one of them.
[time=3247] It will work.
[time=3249] The only thing those people understand is cash.
[time=3254] Remember Kathy had that experience at the Harvester flea market.
[time=3258] She took out the check, what we said, would you take a check?
[time=3261] This Oriental man said no and Kathy said you take MasterCard and the Oriental man said no.
[time=3268] He looked up and he said, but we take cash.
[time=3272] Only one commodity and God only has one commodity.
[time=3278] One means one avenue, one plan for reconciliation.
[time=3282] It was the ultimate one was the death of Jesus Christ in our behalf.
[time=3287] Thirdly, he gives us the purpose of reconciliation.
[time=3292] It's this phrase out of verse 22 through death.
[time=3298] Notice this phrase to present, to present you wholly in his sight without blemish and
[time=3305] free from accusation.
[time=3307] Jesus died to reconcile us to God so that the end product is that he could present us
[time=3313] before God.
[time=3314] The word has a legal sense like a man who is presented and declared innocent, guilt less
[time=3321] and free.
[time=3322] It also has the usage of a beautiful lady, pure not only in white dress but in character,
[time=3331] presented to a pure husband and they're presented to each other for marriage.
[time=3336] Jesus says some day he wants to present us before himself as his bride in three ways.
[time=3344] Holy, we're not holy.
[time=3348] That's why we needed Christ to save us and now that we've received Christ we're still not holy but we're working on it and we will be when he takes us to heaven because he'll
[time=3359] give us a new heart and a new mind and a new body.
[time=3363] I can't present myself holy but Jesus can.
[time=3367] Secondly, he'll present us without blemish, he's going to put the oxy 500 clear cell people
[time=3374] out of business, not a blemish, not a mark on your character and free from accusation.
[time=3381] Not only will you be holy and be without blemish but Jesus said and I'll present you and no
[time=3387] one will even be able to accuse you.
[time=3390] You see right now you can be here in church at five minutes till twelve, don't say amen that we only have five minutes but you can be here right now and somebody could be downtown accusing you of a crime that you had no part in and you'll have to defend yourself and
[time=3405] you'll have to stand before I judge in a juror because you're being accused but Jesus said I will deliver you and present you without accusation.
[time=3416] Another thing he tells us now is the responsibility, verse 23.
[time=3420] If you continue in your faith, established, infirmed, not moved from the hope.
[time=3426] Now very quickly this passage could be misunderstood as saying God will do all these things for
[time=3433] you, he'll reconcile you and he'll present you in this way if you live up to it and if you don't live up to it you won't be presented or you won't be reconciled.
[time=3444] That's a misunderstanding here, allow me to teach you something that comes from the language of the original Greek, it's very simple, you'll catch it quickly.
[time=3453] Whenever you see the word if that means it's a conditional clause and in Greek there are four kinds of conditional clauses, let me name them for you, first, second, third and fourth clause, pretty easy isn't it, so you knew more Greek than you thought.
[time=3466] And a first class clause which this is as a condition perceived to be true.
[time=3472] It's not raising any doubt or it's not saying if then it's just saying if or you might use
[time=3479] the word sense.
[time=3482] Let's take that word sense and put it in there because that's a fair translation.
[time=3487] Since you continue in your faith and established and are firm because the Bible teaches this
[time=3493] truth that if you come to Christ he does more than give you a fire insurance policy, he gives you a brand new life you're changed completely and now you can live for him.
