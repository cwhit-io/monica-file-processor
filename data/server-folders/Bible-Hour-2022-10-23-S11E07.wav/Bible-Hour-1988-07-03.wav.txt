[time=112] A little deception goes a long way.
[time=115] In these days we're faced with not only the proliferation of cults but the lack of integrity amongst leaders within the church.
[time=125] I was amazed this past week to learn that in one cubic mile of fog there's but one simple gallon of water.
[time=134] A little deception goes a long way.
[time=138] [MUSIC][MUSIC] Like theory through windowbird rain [MUSIC] Emotions run together in a flood of doubt and pain [MUSIC] We've prayed as best we can [MUSIC] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] And even though it seems impossible to me [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] But if he chooses not to move [MUSIC] In the way we prayed he would [MUSIC] Confident he's working all together for my good [MUSIC] I will stand behind his word [MUSIC] For he is able [MUSIC] Questions seem to haunt us night and day [MUSIC] How could God allow my heart be torn [MUSIC] Sway [MUSIC] Does he listen when I call [MUSIC] Or is he even there at all [MUSIC] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] And even though it seems impossible to me [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] But if he chooses not to move [MUSIC] In the way we prayed he would [MUSIC] Confident he's working all together for my good [MUSIC] I will stand behind his word [MUSIC] For he is able [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] And as the night gives way to dawning [MUSIC] And evaporates away [MUSIC] I stand to face another day [MUSIC] And I will stand behind his word [MUSIC] For he is able [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC] He is able [MUSIC]
[time=1422] We need the Lord.
[time=1427] We need to know his grace to seek his holy face above the world's acclaim.
[time=1441] We need the Lord.
[time=1446] We need his majesty to lend us dignity and to make us worthy of his name.
[time=1461] We need to see him there everywhere we turn.
[time=1470] We need to look for him and how we need to learn how we need to learn
[time=1486] We need the Lord.
[time=1493] We need his light to see what is eternity and ordinary daily days.
[time=1506] We need the Lord.
[time=1512] We need to bring him when we have reached the end of all our earthly hopes and dreams.
[time=1526] And to the desert of our pain how we need the praise.
[time=1538] And we are not alone when we start knowing the light.
[time=1547] He is the light of the world,
[time=1555] giving us hope.
[time=1561] [MUSIC]
[time=1630] [MUSIC]
[time=1640] â™ª We so much need the Lord.
[time=1649] And we need his word in our hearts.
[time=1651] That's why we have strived this year to memorize a passage of Scripture each week.
[time=1656] If you're visiting with us, I encourage you to recite along with us or to read that verse.
[time=1661] We have it printed on the inside of your bulletin on the right hand side.
[time=1665] Please stand now as we recite God's word.
[time=1672] Colossians 128.
[time=1675] We proclaim him admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.
[time=1688] Colossians 128.
[time=1691] Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1696] Thank you, Dale.
[time=1698] Out of that book of Colossians comes the determination of God's heart and his will for each of us.
[time=1705] First, that we would know Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=1708] Have you been born again into God's family?
[time=1711] And then having received Christ that we not be content with mediocrity or mere existence having been adopted, but there's a determination to walk in Christ.
[time=1723] And so the counsel of God's word is that we move on to maturity.
[time=1728] If you have your Bible today, I invite you to open your Bible with me as we study God's word.
[time=1734] We'll be studying Colossians chapter 2.
[time=1737] And that verse that you've just said from memory is the introduction to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=1743] Paul says, so we proclaim him, Christ Jesus, admonishing and teaching everyone so that with this purpose we might present us perfect in Christ.
[time=1757] Well, perfection is not something any of us are going to achieve, but it is still God's goal and God's plan.
[time=1764] Don't give up because you're not perfect.
[time=1767] Don't concede before the race is over because you know you won't win.
[time=1771] God's calling is that we walk as Christ walk and we strive for perfection.
[time=1778] With that introduction, here's Colossians chapter 2 verses 1 through 7.
[time=1783] I want you to know how much I am struggling for you
[time=1789] and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not met me personally.
[time=1795] My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding.
[time=1806] In order that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[time=1820] I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine sounding arguments.
[time=1827] For though I am absent from you and body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
[time=1840] So then, just as you receive Christ as Lord, continue to live in Him, rooted and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness.
[time=1856] God, as we study Your Word today, we invite, we beg you to be here, and we want you to teach us Your Spirit to ours more than what a human voice can teach.
[time=1870] And as we study Your Word, we want to be challenged today.
[time=1875] Don't make it easy on us.
[time=1877] Make it tough enough so that we grow tall enough to face the trials of tomorrow.
[time=1885] And as we study Your Word, we come across this Word encouragement, and we pray for that encouragement to those who are walking through difficult times today.
[time=1896] We pray for the burn-holders, and thank you that little Brandon is born and that at Riley they've been able to sustain his life, and we pray that he might come through this procedure strong and healthy.
[time=1910] We pray for Julie's battle with Hodgkins, that you will give wisdom to our doctors and make her therapy effective.
[time=1917] We pray that you would encourage Harry Bennett and Catherine Northrup, as they recover from tests and they fight battles.
[time=1926] We pray for Mary Habig, that she will grow strong after back surgery.
[time=1931] We pray that you would encourage hearts there who are going through the bitterness and brokenness of life's trials, that you might take the bitterness and replace it with hope.
[time=1944] And now as we study Your Word, give us an appetite for Christ-likeness.
[time=1949] In Jesus' name today, amen.
[time=1955] Well, the drought is upon us, and the whole earth is parched and crying out for water.
[time=1961] But there's an even greater crying and an even greater drought.
[time=1965] It's a drought for integrity.
[time=1967] In the nation in which we live, the statistics are counter-dictory.
[time=1972] As we look at arrows that should be pointing in the same direction, instead they're crossing.
[time=1977] Although these statistics are not scientific, they are founded and studied.
[time=1982] At the time of the revolution, in July the 4th of 1776, it is estimated that a mere 5% of the people of this country were born again evangelical believers in Christ.
[time=1998] Today, some 200-plus years later, according to a Gallup poll, over 40% of our country declare that they have had a born-again experience.
[time=2011] And so we see one arrow indicating an upward trend that there has been a rapid increase in people who say they have been born-again from 5 to 40%.
[time=2023] Yet while that arrow points upward, there is a counter-dictory arrow that there is a constant rise in ungodliness.
[time=2031] Paradoxical, isn't it?
[time=2033] That in a nation that has seen an 8-fold increase in those who know Jesus Christ, there has been an alarming increase in every form of ungodliness.
[time=2044] We are in danger of finding the contradiction costly.
[time=2049] Proverbs gives us this simple.
[time=2053] Yes, simple but true premise for a nation.
[time=2058] Righteousness exalts a nation, and sin is a reproach to any people.
[time=2066] This particular study in the book of Colossians tells us that there is a need for integrity closing the gap between our walk and our talk.
[time=2077] In Colossians chapter 1, you quoted it this morning, we came across this word perfect.
[time=2083] Here Paul says he is striving, he is proclaiming, and he is admonishing, he is teaching so that he can present everyone perfect in Christ Jesus.
[time=2094] Does that mean that we can obtain a level of perfection in this life today?
[time=2100] No.
[time=2102] The Bible tells us that my little children, these things are right unto you so that you sin not.
[time=2109] That's God's goal.
[time=2111] Next phrase, but if any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ.
[time=2117] God's standard is perfection.
[time=2119] Our goal is to be the same, but the reality says in the striving we will fail from time to time.
[time=2127] But don't let that discourage you.
[time=2129] Don't quit because you can't obtain perfection.
[time=2134] Doctors, skilled as they are, can never operate absolutely perfectly.
[time=2140] But when I go under the knife, I am looking for a doctor who is committed to trying.
[time=2148] Jet pilots cannot guarantee absolute perfection in everything that they do.
[time=2154] But when I'm three rows behind him in the cockpit, I hope his goal is to land it safe every time.
[time=2161] In our Christian life, I know that I'm not going to be perfect.
[time=2165] I don't expect it from you, but God does expect from us the striving to be perfect.
[time=2173] There are several synonymous phrases in the Bible that go along with this concept of perfection.
[time=2179] Another one is Christ-likeness.
[time=2183] The goal of the scriptures for your life and for mine is that in every day, in every way, I become less like myself and more like Christ.
[time=2192] So if somebody was asked, "Have you ever seen Jesus?" they might respond, "No." But I saw a Christian, and I've got a pretty good idea of what he's like.
[time=2204] A number of years ago, we went with Operation Outreach to Clearwater, Florida.
[time=2209] And a close friend of ours, brother, is a part of that church.
[time=2213] We had never met Don Siglin before, but I knew Dale Siglin well.
[time=2218] In the crowd of about 3,000 people, it took us about two minutes to spot him and to identify him.
[time=2224] He looks exactly like Dale.
[time=2227] Although Dale would want me to mention Don looks much older.
[time=2231] But their brothers, their walk is identical.
[time=2235] The way they hold their coffee cup is identical.
[time=2238] The way they talk is identical.
[time=2240] And if you know Dale, you know Don.
[time=2243] And it ought to be, if you know one of us, you know Jesus, because we're so much alike.
[time=2252] Another synonym that is used in the scripture by way of analogy is the word disciple.
[time=2258] Jesus distinguished between those who casually followed him and those who indeed were following him.
[time=2265] In John 831, he said, if you continue in my word, then you're my disciple indeed.
[time=2274] Another phrase that's used is walking in Christ.
[time=2279] That we walk, we order our life, we make decisions, we take steps in a fashion that Christ would take.
[time=2288] The final phrase that's used is spiritual maturity.
[time=2292] I like it best because it seems to be so straightforward, we can identify instantly what it means.
[time=2298] God's plan for you is not just that you're born again, but that you mature spiritually in Christ.
[time=2308] Here in Colossians 2 verses 1 through 7 are four principles for requirements for spiritual maturity.
[time=2317] We'll give you two today and two next week.
[time=2320] Principle number one is found in verse one, it's this.
[time=2324] Maturity requires struggling constantly.
[time=2330] Chapter two, verse one.
[time=2332] I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those of you and for all who have not met me personally.
[time=2345] Apostle Paul begins by speaking about the Christian life, his own, his determination for them that they mature and he says, it is a struggle and he wants them to know that.
[time=2356] He says, my desire is that you understand that I am struggling in your behalf.
[time=2363] If you're a believer and you're contemplating defection today, before you start your path, remember it's not only your life
[time=2373] that you will impact, but there have been Christians who have invested in your life, they have struggled in your behalf,
[time=2383] don't defect and make their effort not.
[time=2388] And more important than the Pauls of your life who have struggled for you, don't ever forget that Jesus Christ died for you,
[time=2398] don't defect.
[time=2401] It requires of a man or woman who wants spiritual maturity that they be willing to struggle constantly.
[time=2410] The Greek word translated struggle is actually the word agony.
[time=2415] It's a Greek word and they just take it into English letters and you come up with the word agony.
[time=2421] It's used primarily in two senses, an athletic sense and a military sense.
[time=2427] Almost everybody has seen at least one time the introduction to ABC wide world of sports.
[time=2434] When they talk about the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat and they show that skier going down the hill, crashing, and I get sympathy pains in parts of my body I didn't know I had.
[time=2448] You know what agony of defeat is.
[time=2451] It's an athletic term.
[time=2453] Paul says like the athlete who has spent himself completely, so spend yourself completely struggling for maturity.
[time=2464] It's also a word of military definition.
[time=2468] This word speaks of the heat of the battle, not the strategy room where the generals plot out the map, but it speaks of the soldier who is eyeball to eyeball and blade to blade fighting the battle.
[time=2482] Here the apostle Paul uses that word agony struggling face to face
[time=2491] in the battle.
[time=2494] You, like me, may have been the victim of some misleading testimonies or some misleading theology.
[time=2502] You've heard it somewhere along the way, a very sweet soul, meaning well, stands up and identifies all kinds of problems that they had.
[time=2512] Then they ask Jesus into their heart and now everything is wonderful.
[time=2518] If that indeed happened, it was the exception, not the norm.
[time=2526] The Bible tells us that coming to Christ is a new birth and the battle just begins.
[time=2534] Jesus said, "In this life you will have tribulation."
[time=2541] Even if you come to Christ, he never promised that he would make it easy.
[time=2547] He only promised that he would be there.
[time=2551] He never said, "And I will keep you from the valley of the shadow of death." He said, "In the valley of the shadow of death, don't fear for I am with you."
[time=2563] And, too much in the form of misleading theology.
[time=2567] Phrases like, "Just come to Christ, let go and let God." That works about as well with spiritual maturity as it does with physical maturity.
[time=2577] Just taking your kids at birth and saying, "I'm just going to let go and let God." I remember when our first child was born, a wise friend said to Kathy,
[time=2588] "After the labor was over, that was the easy part." Now you get to raise them for 18 to 20 years.
[time=2596] And maturing children is not easy.
[time=2599] And maturing spiritual lives is just as difficult.
[time=2604] The theology of the day teaches two false concepts.
[time=2607] False concept number one is this.
[time=2609] It's God's will that everybody have great wealth and concept number two.
[time=2614] It's God's will that everybody have good health.
[time=2619] God's bless and we want to thank Him for His blessing.
[time=2623] But God never passes out spiritual exemptions from the hardships of life.
[time=2628] Christians get cancer.
[time=2631] Christians are victimized and assaulted.
[time=2634] Christians go through every type of trial, every type of testing, financial, emotional that every other person goes through.
[time=2643] Depression strikes at Christians.
[time=2646] Cancer, heart attack, car accidents, misconceptions of birth.
[time=2653] Every event that this world goes through, we will go through.
[time=2658] Jesus did promise though, "I am with you and I will help you." And He is able to strengthen and to support.
[time=2668] In this struggle, we will face an innumerable list of enemies,
[time=2674] and allow me to tip you off to three of them.
[time=2677] Enemy number one that you'll have to struggle against constantly is yourself.
[time=2683] The Bible says that we have an old nature, and that we must wrestle with that old nature
[time=2690] moment by moment and day by day, though you may have control of it today,
[time=2696] tomorrow that old nature will flare up like a ferocious lion.
[time=2701] When we read a biography of Andrew Jackson once, one of his young friends said that when Andy was a little boy, he wasn't all that tough.
[time=2710] His friend said as a matter of fact, anybody in town could whip Andy Jackson, but the problem was Andy wouldn't stay whooped.
[time=2718] And that's how it is with our old nature.
[time=2721] On one day, we can whip that old nature, but it doesn't stay in that colloquialism whooped.
[time=2728] It comes back, and you have to fight it again and again and again.
[time=2734] The second enemy you'll have to struggle with constantly is the enemy of our society.
[time=2741] We had two delightful weeks in Jamaica doing missions work.
[time=2746] We had been back two days, we're driving down the street, and Kathy said, do you know what one of the best things about Jamaica was?
[time=2753] We did not watch television for two weeks.
[time=2757] It's amazing how our want and need list shrunk.
[time=2761] When there wasn't a constant bombardment of somebody telling you how you've got to have it, you need it.
[time=2767] Your life is empty without it, and at the end of it all, you discover they're talking about their brand of toothpaste.
[time=2775] Television is simply a microcosm of our society that constantly wants to,
[time=2782] and the words of Romans 12, squeeze us into its mold.
[time=2788] And you and I must be in this world, but not of it.
[time=2794] We're a lot like a boat. A boat is made to be in the water.
[time=2798] It's useless out of the water. It's when you get the water in the boat that you have a problem.
[time=2804] And Christians are supposed to be in the world. It's not a Christian in the world that's a problem.
[time=2810] When the world gets into the Christian, we would be useless.
[time=2815] God never said withdrawal from the world. He said, penetrate, but penetrate with integrity.
[time=2823] The third enemy that we will fight, I'm sad to say, but I must, is other Christians.
[time=2830] You see, Christians have two problems. One, we are hypocritical, and the second is, we're hypercritical.
[time=2839] And that none of us can make our walk and our talk totally match.
[time=2846] We will all fail. We will all have shortcomings.
[time=2850] Mark Twain put it best when he said, we are all like the moon. We each have our dark side.
[time=2858] There's not a perfect Christian here, seated or standing.
[time=2865] But don't ever let somebody who's a bad example, someone who is hypocritical,
[time=2871] keep you from becoming a believer in Christ, or keep you from maturing in Christ.
[time=2877] Plan on it, expect it, Jesus faced it, and so will each of us.
[time=2883] We also face not only those who are hypocritical, but those who are hypercritical.
[time=2888] There's something about churches that foster a critical spirit.
[time=2892] As soon as you start going forward in Christ, there'll be one person who will tell you why you shouldn't, another who will tell you should, but you should have done it differently.
[time=2902] And don't ever become discouraged by those who tell you how to do it when they are not.
[time=2908] Just keep going and keep growing. Don't let the critics get you down.
[time=2915] The Bible tells us that if we are going to have a spiritual maturity, it requires of us this, that we struggle constantly.
[time=2926] Secondly, spiritual maturity requires of us that we study Christ.
[time=2934] Chapter 2, verses 2 and 3.
[time=2937] My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love
[time=2944] so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ, in whom are hidden all of the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.
[time=2960] This is a very complex structure of a sentence.
[time=2964] He begins by declaring his purpose. Paul said, "I'm struggling in your behalf and my purpose is for the producing of courageous hearts and contagious hearts."
[time=2978] Notice he says, "I am striving. I am struggling in your behalf to encourage your heart."
[time=2986] Now, when the Bible speaks about the heart, it speaks about the inner person, the real you.
[time=2992] The heart describes both the mind and the emotions, and thirdly, the will.
[time=2998] The Bible says that Jesus looked at the Pharisees and said, "Why reason you these things in your heart?" So the heart is being used to describe the thinking organ, the brain.
[time=3010] But then it says Jesus said, "Let your heart be not troubled, neither let it be afraid."
[time=3017] The heart is also the emotions, the positive emotions of joy and peace and fulfillment.
[time=3024] Those more negative ones of fear and discomfort, the heart.
[time=3029] But it's also the will.
[time=3031] The Bible says you are to follow Christ wholeheartedly.
[time=3037] So when the Bible says your heart, it's speaking about the total inner you, mind, emotion, and will.
[time=3045] And here the Bible tells us Paul's ministry was to encourage their heart.
[time=3051] If you just take the word encourage, what does it mean?
[time=3054] It means to put courage in.
[time=3056] When you encourage someone, you come alongside of them, and you take them, and by your companionship, by your example, by your words, you give them refreshment and new strength, you put courage into them.
[time=3070] That's what the word means, to walk alongside and to put courage in.
[time=3076] Paul said, "I want to encourage your heart, I want to give you a courageous heart."
[time=3082] But along with that courageous heart, he secondly says, "I want to give you a contagious heart." With all of these metaphors and analogies of military, we aren't just a fighting machine.
[time=3093] He said, "I want to encourage their hearts and unite them in love."
[time=3099] It ought to be that every Sunday morning, there is a constant stream of visitors to this church.
[time=3106] And if they were asked, "Why have you come?" Their response ought to be, "Well, I saw two or three Christians, and I was just amazed at how they loved each other,
[time=3116] and I wanted to get in on it." We ought to be contagious in our heart, love for one another.
[time=3125] Paul said, "I want to build them up so that they're courageous and contagious,
[time=3131] and that will have this effect so that they may have the full riches, the complete riches of understanding."
[time=3143] He said that as you get built up, you'll understand more, and that understanding will reveal to you a mystery.
[time=3151] And that mystery is Christ, and it's in Him, are hidden all of the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge of God.
[time=3165] Along the way here, he uses three different words to describe some form of knowledge.
[time=3170] The first one is found in verse two where he says, "Complete understanding." That is a word that means your discerning ability, your critical knowledge, not that you're being critical of spirit,
[time=3182] but your ability to evaluate into discern on this old-fashioned Sunday.
[time=3188] Can we call it your horse sense, your common sense?
[time=3193] The second word that he uses is this word treasures of wisdom.
[time=3198] Some of you have just completed your sophomore year.
[time=3202] A sophomore, someone who has Sophia, that is wise, moron, foolish.
[time=3209] You're at that point of life where you know a little bit, but not as much as you think you do in your wise and foolish.
[time=3216] Well, that's Sophia's our word here, and it speaks of the person's reasoning ability.
[time=3221] Their intellect, their ability to not only know something, but to think through it, defend it and explain it.
[time=3229] Then the next word that is used is a word that simply means knowledge, your raw grasp of the facts.
[time=3238] It doesn't mean that you have to reason or deduce, it just means you've been told you understand it and now you have the knowledge of it.
[time=3246] Well, if you want common sense, insight for living, if you want knowledge and wisdom, they are all hidden in Christ.
[time=3260] That doesn't mean that if you study the Bible you'll learn how to practice medicine.
[time=3265] It doesn't mean if you study the Bible you'll be able to solve the quadratic equation in algebra class.
[time=3270] It doesn't mean that somewhere in here there's a book of computers that will teach you language for computers.
[time=3276] What it is saying is behind every academic discipline there is intellect, mind, emotion and will that needs the ability to apply those facts and all of that is hidden in Christ.
[time=3295] And if you want spiritual maturity you must be willing to immerse your heart, your mind and your total thinking in this book of the scriptures so that you can study Christ.
[time=3313] For in him is hidden all the wisdom, all the knowledge and all the treasures of God.
[time=3320] Next week we'll look at these two principles very closely but allow me to list them for you today.
[time=3326] The third principle, the third requirement of spiritual maturity is found in verse 4 and that is this one that maturity requires standing cautious.
[time=3339] I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine sounding arguments.
[time=3345] You will discover that in life you must be cautious spiritually.
[time=3350] There's an economic term called caveat-empature which means let the buyer beware.
[time=3356] May I be so blunt as to say this morning when you turn on the television set and somebody holds a Bible in their hand, let the buyer beware.
[time=3367] When you pick up a book that has a little bit of religion to it, let the buyer beware.
[time=3374] Stand cautiously and the fourth principle, and again we'll look at it at length next week, maturity requires staying committed.
[time=3389] Verse 6, "So then just as you receive Christ Jesus as Lord continue to live in him."
[time=3399] Initial commitment is essential, but as essential's initial commitment is followed through.
[time=3407] Would you be a mature believer in Christ today?
[time=3411] Four clear principles of Scripture.
[time=3414] One, struggling constantly.
[time=3418] Two, studying Christ.
[time=3421] Three, standing cautious.
[time=3425] Four, staying committed.
[time=3428] It's a struggle.
[time=3431] Allow me to close with these words of Isaac Watts.
[time=3436] Am I a soldier of the cross?
[time=3439] A follower of the Lamb?
[time=3442] And shall I fear to only cause our blush to speak his name?
[time=3448] Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease, while others fought to win the prize and sailed the bloody seas?
[time=3458] Are there no foes for me to face?
[time=3463] Must I not stem the flood? Is this vile world a friend of grace to lead me on to God?
[time=3475] Sure I must fight if I would reign.
[time=3480] Increase my courage, Lord.
[time=3484] I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, supported by thy word.
[time=3495] May I ask you two questions this morning.
[time=3498] Have you received Christ as Savior, and are you a soldier of the cross?
[time=3514] We've been sharing with you the music of our sanctuary choir and our special guests Anita Lustria.
[time=3531] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3534] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you. Let's bow together.
[time=3543] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3550] Today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me.
[time=3555] I ask you to cleanse me today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed this prayer with me this morning, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3566] And then when you write, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3574] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Grief's Healing Process", please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East-State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
