[time=90] >>Peter the Great had literally put Russia on the map.
[time=111] It was at the beginning of the 18th century that he waged a campaign and established an empire that took Russia from sea to sea.
[time=121] Later it is life Peter said, "I have conquered an empire, but I have been unable to conquer myself."

[time=144] >>Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Haas.
[time=146] Thank you for joining us. Today Rick is continuing his message from the book of Colossians entitled Rooted for Strength.
[time=153] One of the most difficult battles we ever fight is the battle with ourselves.
[time=157] This is a war few of us will win.
[time=159] The alcoholic and the drug addict are obvious examples of fatalities of this war.
[time=163] But there are other less obvious casualties.
[time=166] The compulsive credit spender.
[time=168] The bitter heart that cannot forgive.
[time=170] The tongue untamed.
[time=172] The tep are out of control and the apathetic soul unmoved by neither needs or desires.
[time=178] The war is on the victory's cue.
[time=181] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Colossians.
[time=184] Chapter 2, we'll be looking at verses 1 through 7.
[time=188] Special music includes a song from the sanctuary choir.
[time=194] And Keith and Starr Bratago.
[time=198] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=205] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=210] Now here's Rick.
[time=211] For our worship service, we've met in this place to worship the Lord and to encourage one another and provoke one another to serving Christ more wholeheartedly and more fully.
[time=222] We're delighted that you've come and we're delighted that we have friends joining us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=230] This Sunday of the month, we have the privilege of not only our choir, but our orchestra playing along today, ministering to us in the song that says, "God is Real."
[time=244] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=470] What a great delight to proclaim that Jesus Christ is real in our lives and I hope that as you experience that love of the Lord internally, that you will express it to one another and to your friends and loved ones.
[time=482] To God be the glory for the things that He does for us, number 52, please, Him number 52.
[time=489] [MUSIC - 182 seconds]
[time=677] Amen, thank you for your good singing.
[time=680] It's great to rejoice in the Lord and have all of you joining together in remembering the things that God has done for us.
[time=689] On television, I told the, in our insert that we cut out, but I am sure that our producer kept.
[time=697] I introduced our musicians today as a thief in car, but really it's Keith and Starr Bradagum.
[time=705] We're glad when they come back to sing for us.
[time=708] We love them and they have a marvelous ministry in music and we're just glad that they're in Fort Wayne.
[time=713] They leave us occasionally, but they're here today to minister to us.
[time=716] Let's listen to Keith and Starr Bradagum as they sing for us right now.
[time=720] [MUSIC - 198 seconds]
[time=934] Hello and thank you again for joining us today here for the Bible Hour.
[time=940] I know that you've already enjoyed the ministry of our choir and Keith and Starr and we're looking forward to hearing from them again in just a few moments.
[time=948] Pete, the panorama last weekend was just a delight.
[time=952] Well, it was certainly warm enough for a picnic and we had a great host of people and a good concert with the King's Brass and I think it was all that we expected it to be.
[time=960] We had a great time together.
[time=962] Really did. We'd been praying for no rain on July the 3rd so we could have that concert and I think our prayers got confused and prayed for no rain until July the 3rd.
[time=972] And if you're out there praying that it won't rain on our picnic please start praying for rain.
[time=978] It was pleasant to have a few sprinkling drops this morning.
[time=982] It was early in the morning. It looked like a great day of showers and all of a sudden about 10 minutes later it stopped but I think we're expecting a little more this afternoon.
[time=990] We would encourage you to be praying for that situation.
[time=994] Of course we are broadcasting a week early and perhaps from the time we say this to the time you hear God will have answered some of those prayers but the farmers and the whole community is in desperate need of praying that God would open up heaven and shower us with rain.
[time=1010] We're looking forward to the rest of today's service and some events coming up in the life of our church and in the not too distant future we have a fall kickoff with Buddy Green.
[time=1019] We have a lot of things already scheduled for the fall and one of them is a concert with Buddy Green.
[time=1023] Just a few years ago we had a concert Rick with a harpist and I remember when I said it will be about an hour and a half you kind of wondered.
[time=1030] I wondered.
[time=1031] And now I bring up the fact that we're having a harmonica player come and be with us all day on September 11th but he's an orchestra in himself.
[time=1040] He was at praise gathering with Bill and Gloria Gather last fall and I was amazed at what he can do with a small little instrument like the harmonica.
[time=1049] He is a very exciting musician and has a great testimony.
[time=1052] Boy that will be an exciting day.
[time=1054] At September 11th he'll be here in our morning worship service and on the Bible hour and then he'll be here with us for the evening service September 11th at 6 p.m.
[time=1062] You know I had the privilege of hearing Buddy Green and it sounds unbelievable but this young man can take a harmonica.
[time=1070] He can play the William Tell Overture and if you don't know the William Tell Overture you remember the opening to the Lone Ranger.
[time=1076] He can make that harmonica sound like 10 or 12 pieces of an orchestra.
[time=1080] He's amazing.
[time=1081] It really is so we'll look forward to sharing Buddy Green's ministry with you and while we're talking about future events we want to encourage you to save the weekend of October 14th, 15th and 16th for the dedication services of our new sanctuary.
[time=1095] Just circle those dates on your calendar and next week we'll tell you a little bit more about those activities.
[time=1101] Also during the month of August we have what we call the practical living seminar.
[time=1106] On Wednesday evenings at 7 o'clock there'll be eight different electives you can take from learning to manage your money with some biblical concepts of stewardship, handling depression, ethics in the business marketplace, eight different practical topics
[time=1122] taught by people who have walked in those areas of business or life and it's a great way to apply God's Word to some specific areas.
[time=1130] So as the month of August comes save Wednesday nights at 7 o'clock for the practical living seminars.
[time=1138] We also want to encourage you to write today for this new booklet entitled Strange Cults in America.
[time=1145] We're presently studying through the Book of Colossians and Colossians chapter 2 gives us this admonition to stay cautious.
[time=1153] There's a great deal of deception out there and the deception that is the most effective is the deception that is closest to the truth.
[time=1162] And so there are many cults springing up in America that have a portion of the truth or something very close to the truth but it's actually an error.
[time=1172] And we want you to be advised in warned and this booklet will do a great job
[time=1178] of helping you to decipher truth from air.
[time=1181] So if you would like a copy simply write to us today and we'll send you your copy right away.
[time=1187] To receive your copy right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1197] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1205] Thank you Peter and thank you for joining us today here on the Bible Hour and now as we go back you can enjoy once again the ministry of Keith and Starr.
[time=1217] He loved me before the world was known.
[time=1230] He chose me to be his very own.
[time=1237] He made me then let me choose my way.
[time=1246] I chose to move away.
[time=1251] He loved me.
[time=1255] When hope had taken way, he loved me.
[time=1262] When I lost everything, then he bought me.
[time=1268] Redemption's work was done through Jesus Christ his son.
[time=1281] Who shall separate me from the love of God?
[time=1292] Shall dreams of tomorrow?
[time=1298] Pain or sorrow?
[time=1303] Can the need of food or sleep possessions?
[time=1309] The threat of war or man's oppressions?
[time=1316] In all these things?
[time=1321] The trees are reward.
[time=1332] Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=1342] All this I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[time=1359] nor things present, nor things to go.
[time=1374] Nor death nor any creature shall separate me from the love of God.
[time=1388] All this I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[time=1407] nor things present, nor things to go.
[time=1417] Nor death nor any creature shall separate me from the love of God.
[time=1436] Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=1457] Aren't you thankful for the many ways that we can get scripture in our hearts?
[time=1461] We can't all sing scripture the way that we've just heard from star, we can if we work at it can memorize the scripture and have it in our hearts so that we can share it with others.
[time=1470] Let's stand now as we recite Colossians 128 together this week.
[time=1478] Colossians 128 we proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.
[time=1493] Colossians 128 thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1523] Praise your faith in his Son.
[time=1531] May his gentle spirit fill you with his joy as you walk by faith in what he's done.
[time=1549] May his peace follow you in believing as you find sweet release in receiving.
[time=1565] May your life overflow and abound with hope as his spirit fills you inside.
[time=1583] May you know his power every day of your life as you rest in his love and abide.
[time=1605] Abide with me best for sleep and time.
[time=1617] The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide.
[time=1630] Then all the helpless fail and comforts me.
[time=1642] Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
[time=1657] I feel no foe with thee at hand to bless.
[time=1669] Hills have no weight and fears no bitterness.
[time=1681] There is death's thing where grave thy victory.
[time=1692] I try on still if the abide with me.
[time=1705] May his peace follow you in believing as you find sweet release in receiving.
[time=1721] May your life overflow and abound with hope as his spirit fills you inside.
[time=1738] May you know his power every day of your life as you rest in his love and abide.
[time=1768] Father, it is our prayer today, O Lord, abide with me.
[time=1783] Father, we would pray that your spirit would be present and its power would be made known in each of our lives today.
[time=1791] It is our prayer that your spirit would abide with us and give us courage for the battle ahead.
[time=1797] We pray today for those who are facing such difficult battles, those who are fighting discouragement and depression,
[time=1806] that they might seek out that professional help and yet moreover that they would have a word of encouragement from you.
[time=1814] We pray that you would encourage those who are living with a husband or a wife who is abusive of alcohol.
[time=1825] We pray that you might bring about in their life strength for that battle.
[time=1831] We pray today for those who are struggling with their adolescence, students who are compromising conviction.
[time=1841] Parents are at a loss to know how to control behavior and to shape the life of a young person who is hard of heart.
[time=1850] We pray that you would give wisdom.
[time=1853] We pray today for those who are trying to graciously win back their spouses, that you would give to them compassion and patience and perseverance.
[time=1864] We pray that as a body of people you would give us a hunger and a thirst for righteousness.
[time=1870] We pray that you would give us a desire to be holy more than to be happy.
[time=1875] And then may we find the fruit of holiness is the happiness that we never gave up to begin with.
[time=1881] Father we pray that your spirit would abide with us and comfort those who are suffering loss.
[time=1887] Particularly we pray for Dick and Betty Belair and Lynette Flowers in the death of Jeremy.
[time=1894] We pray today for healing for Julie Brookholder.
[time=1901] And we would ask that you would work in her life as she battles Hodgkin's disease just as you work in their baby's life brand and to bring about a recovery.
[time=1910] And Father as we pray today we bring these burdens to you and ask you not only to make our burdens lighter but to make us stronger.
[time=1921] To make us men and women of maturity who can be found faithful to you in the tough times.
[time=1929] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=1934] Peter called Peter the great out of Russian history is often called the father of modern Russia.
[time=1946] When he ascended to the throne of Tsar we would call that title king.
[time=1951] Russia was a medieval feudal state hundreds of years behind the rest of Europe.
[time=1958] Her greatest problem was that on the west she was landlocked she had no seaports, no access to the Atlantic or to the Baltic.
[time=1967] But Peter the great took power.
[time=1969] He expanded the empire not only to the east but to the west and he took Russia and he made her stretch from ocean to ocean.
[time=1978] Capturing parts of the Baltic states and of Finland and he made Russia a great power and brought her into the modern era.
[time=1986] He had conquered his empire. Later in life Peter the great said these words.
[time=1994] I have conquered an empire yet I am unable to conquer myself.
[time=2010] We today need to learn the words of that Tsar.
[time=2016] The necessity and life of conquering ourselves.
[time=2021] We see the drug addict or the alcoholic and we see that individual an obvious need of self-control.
[time=2029] But there are many of us if not all of us who are struggling with less visible enemies.
[time=2035] Like the one whose compulsive credit card spending is out of control.
[time=2042] The one whose tongue is untamed.
[time=2046] The other whose temper is not in check.
[time=2050] The one whose thought life ungodly, unspoken, but unshakable.
[time=2060] The one whose life on the outside appears to be an order but on the inside.
[time=2066] Civil war is being waged and they are losing.
[time=2071] I have conquered an empire but I am unable to conquer myself.
[time=2077] If you have a Bible with you today I invite you to open it to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=2082] Last week and this week we are studying principles of spiritual maturity.
[time=2087] How can we conquer ourselves? How can we become less like me?
[time=2092] And more like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2095] Colossians chapter 2 verses 1 through 7 allow me to read those for you now.
[time=2101] Colossians 2 verse 1.
[time=2104] I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea
[time=2111] and for all who have not met me personally.
[time=2115] My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love
[time=2121] so they may have the full riches of complete understanding.
[time=2126] In order that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ,
[time=2133] in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[time=2139] I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine sounding arguments.
[time=2146] For though I am absent from you and body I am present with you in spirit
[time=2152] and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
[time=2159] So then just as you receive Christ as Lord continue to live in Him rooted
[time=2166] and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness.
[time=2176] In this passage Paul has said much and I have gathered it for my own teaching
[time=2183] to teach myself before you in the four simple principles that produce spiritual maturity.
[time=2190] We gave you two of those last week but let me give a reminder this morning.
[time=2195] Principle number one out of verse one is this one.
[time=2198] Spiritual maturity requires struggling constantly.
[time=2204] He says I want you to know that I am struggling.
[time=2207] That word is agonizing.
[time=2209] It is a word that is rooted both in athletics and in military campaign.
[time=2214] He says there is a war out there that he is fighting and though fight is within himself as though he was a man at civil war
[time=2224] and he was struggling not only in his behalf but in the behalf of all Christians those at Colossae, those at neighboring Laodicea and all Christians whether you ever met Paul or not his struggle was to produce spiritual maturity.
[time=2239] Here is a war taking place, a war on the inside of each of us.
[time=2245] D.L. Moody was a gifted, gifted man spiritually and he had had to face many, many opponents in his ministry.
[time=2255] Some of his opponents were those who were far too liberal and attacked him for his conservatism.
[time=2261] Many of them attacked him because of his crudeness.
[time=2264] Some attacked him because of his weight excess of 300 pounds but many attacked him because of his inability to handle the king's English.
[time=2273] I shared with you once before Moody went to Cambridge to speak and the students at Cambridge in mass boycotted Moody's lecture because he was so atrocious with the king's English they thought he was unfit to minister in their chapel.
[time=2288] Moody was true to form.
[time=2290] He stood in Cambridge's chapel and the first words he said were "don't think God don't love you, for he do." He lived up to every one of their expectations and he faced that type of opposition all of his life but Moody said these words.
[time=2310] "I must confess to you that I have had more trouble with myself than with any other man with whom I have had to deal." Spiritual maturity requires struggling constantly.
[time=2326] An American Indian describes his struggle in this way to a friend.
[time=2330] He said, "It's like I have two dogs inside of me.
[time=2333] The one dog represents everything that's good and the other dog everything that's bad and they fight." And the friend says, "Well, who wins?" And the man says, "Whichever dog I say, sick them."
[time=2348] That's the one that wins.
[time=2352] You see within each of us there are two natures.
[time=2355] Galatians 5, 17 says, "The spirit wars against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit.
[time=2362] The two are contrary and you cannot do that which you would." Who's going to win that battle whichever one spirit or flesh you decide to say, sick them too?
[time=2374] Whoever you team up with will win that battle.
[time=2378] Spiritual maturity, first of all, requires struggling constantly.
[time=2383] Secondly, it requires studying Christ.
[time=2386] Verses 2 and 3 are a very elaborate grammatical structure with one purpose clause leading to another purpose clause.
[time=2394] Paul says, "My purpose," that gives you that it's a purpose clause, is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that that's a purpose clause built on the first one.
[time=2404] They may have the four riches of complete understanding.
[time=2407] In order that, there's a third purpose clause.
[time=2410] You see how this is a stairway building up and when you get to the crescendo, it says, "So that you may know the mystery of God, namely Christ."
[time=2421] He says, "If you want a contagious heart and a courageous heart, you've got to study Christ." Not casual knowing, but thorough knowing the mystery of the person of Christ.
[time=2437] J.B. Phillips in his letters to young churches puts it this way.
[time=2443] The great difference between present day Christianity and that of which we read in these letters is that it is to us primarily a performance, but to them it was a real experience.
[time=2459] These men felt quite plainly the invasion of their lives
[time=2465] by a new quality of life altogether.
[time=2468] They do not hesitate to describe it as Christ living in them.
[time=2475] Spiritual maturity requires studying Christ.
[time=2481] Now these two new principles, principle number three.
[time=2486] Spiritual maturity requires staying cautious.
[time=2494] Chapter one, the second half in these first few verses of chapter two,
[time=2504] Paul's making an impassionate appeal, but it's almost though he hasn't yet got to the point.
[time=2510] And in verse four he gets to the point he said, "I say all of this, everything that's preceded, I'm saying it so that no one will deceive you with fine sounding arguments." Paul's appeal to them is that they stay cautious because there is a war out there and the war takes a form of deception.
[time=2536] And so as he appeals to them to stay cautious he gives them a point of warning and a point of rejoicing.
[time=2542] He warns them first of all about deception.
[time=2547] The word for deception is a picture-esque word.
[time=2550] I hesitate to use foreign words with you too often, but this one is too good.
[time=2555] It entices me and I must.
[time=2557] The word for deceive is this one.
[time=2559] It is the word parolo ditzomai.
[time=2562] Let me break it down for you.
[time=2564] The word para means near or around or approximate.
[time=2569] So if somebody is a paramedic they are not a medical doctor but they have studied in that field and they're near a doctor, they're around that, they are para near it.
[time=2581] Logitzomai is the Greek word from which we get our word logic.
[time=2586] So someone who parolo ditzomai is someone who reasons who logics around the truth but not right on the truth.
[time=2597] It's someone who has the ability to reckon, to think, to deduce, but that which they come up with, that which they declare is not the truth, it's only a deception near the truth.
[time=2610] And you see the greatest deception is the one that is closest
[time=2618] to the truth.
[time=2619] Not the one furthest but the one that is para near us the truth.
[time=2623] Let me illustrate that for you.
[time=2625] Suppose I say to you ten years ago when I was a much younger, stronger man in in shape, I accomplished an athletic feat that I've never shared with you before but today I'm going to tell you.
[time=2637] I was in a weightlifting contest, it's called a snatch and jerk where you bend down, you grab the bar and you snatch it up and you jerk it up.
[time=2647] And I was able to lift 2,500 pounds above my head and hold it there.
[time=2654] Now there's not anybody in this place that even would begin to believe that.
[time=2659] But suppose I told you that I went down for the clean and jerk and I cleaned it up the air and I jerked it up there and I jerked 250 pounds over my head.
[time=2669] You'd probably be saying, well, ten years ago, maybe he wasn't so puny, you know, maybe, maybe.
[time=2679] That's close enough to the truth that you might be tempted to believe it.
[time=2684] The truth was it was 25 pounds, I got it to here and I dropped it.
[time=2688] (Laughter) But you see the deception that is closest to the truth is the one that we're most likely to believe.
[time=2697] The one furthest from the truth is the one we would never believe in a moment.
[time=2701] That's why Oliver North, who I'm either siding with or against, said at the Iran Contra hearings to Mr. Inouye, "Yes, sir, we sat in our officer and we fabricated what we believed to be the greatest plausible deception." And there is one today called Satan who is fabricating the greatest plausible deception that is so near the truth that you and I are very likely to believe it
[time=2736] because it is right around the truth.
[time=2741] There's a second description that's given here, he says, those who deceive by fine-sounding arguments.
[time=2750] In our society today, there is an expression that came out of the 60s that says the medium is the message.
[time=2759] Now, by that expression, what is being told us is it's not what you say that counts
[time=2765] but how you say it.
[time=2768] And we are victims of all of that.
[time=2771] We are far more impressed with the person who can communicate with humor and energy and vitality, whether he has or has not, content is an important.
[time=2783] If this individual is eloquent and has fine-sounding arguments and no content, this individual has content, but he's not very colorful, will line up behind this guy and say, what is that guy speaking again?
[time=2797] You see, in our society, the medium has become the message.
[time=2801] We're more impressed with the skills of the messenger than we are the content of his message, and we are enticed because somebody comes along and they have gifts of communication, they're reasoning close to the truth, and they have the ability to mistake it, make it sound like it's right, and they packaged it, and we say, that's great.
[time=2823] Paul says, I say all of this to you to warn you
[time=2830] so that nobody deceives you with a fine-sounding argument.
[time=2838] Beloved a little deception goes a long, long way.
[time=2845] I read in an article this past week that in one cubic mile of fog, that means if you want a mile from here to the east, you'd go all the way to Georgetown, and then if you turn north and want a mile all the way to Stillhorn Road, Stillhorn Road back to our building, you've made one square mile.
[time=2865] Now, cube it, take it and go up and form a cube, that in that square mile fog there may be as little as one gallon of water.
[time=2874] Little water makes a lot of fog, and a little deception can fog all of us in spiritually, and we'll make shipwreck our lives.
[time=2885] A little deception can go a long, long way.
[time=2889] So Paul's appeal, would you like to be spiritually mature than it requires of you staying cautious, and there's his word of warning?
[time=2900] But secondly, he has a point of rejoicing as well.
[time=2903] In verse five he says, "Although I'm not with you physically, I am with you in spirit." Now, if we were paraphrasing that today based upon most people in church, we'd say, "I am with you physically, but I'm not with you in spirit." I'm at the golf course replaying that last pot, or I'm at home worrying about the roast, but Paul was not there physically, but in spirit he was there, and he has learned of them two things that cause his heart to rejoice.
[time=2931] You have to find historian William Barkley.
[time=2934] These are military terms.
[time=2936] The first one he says is, "I rejoice to hear how orderly you are." Barkley says the word orderly there refers to an army that regiment upon regiment,
[time=2948] row upon row, soldier upon soldier, everything is in place and positioned.
[time=2957] Paul says, "I rejoice to discover in your spiritual lives you have things in order."
[time=2964] I wonder how many of us this morning know of some areas of our spiritual life that are out of order, and we treat them a lot like our garage door.
[time=2974] As long as it's down, nobody sees what's on the inside.
[time=2978] We had the Jamaica 88 team over yesterday, and we cleaned up the backyard and the front yard, did a few little special things, and then the last moment frantically threw everything into the garage, and the place looked immaculate until somebody hit the garage door button.
[time=2995] And if I find out who did that, I'm going to take everything in my garage and throw it in their front yard.
[time=3002] I had everything covered over, and it made it look like everything was in order.
[time=3009] Many of us spiritually have covered things over, but on the inside things are not in order.
[time=3015] Paul rejoiced at this church Christ rejoiced with every Christian whose spiritual life is in order.
[time=3023] Anything out of order in your life?
[time=3026] Let's start fixing it today.
[time=3029] Second thing you said is that you are standing firm.
[time=3033] Steadfast is how one translation puts it.
[time=3036] Again, a military term according to Barkley.
[time=3039] It now pictures the soldiers not in order, but under attack.
[time=3043] And the enemy is attacked, but they are standing their ground and they are holding fast in the face of adversity.
[time=3050] Like the Civil War General, Stonewall Jackson, standing his ground as all the Confederate forces would fail.
[time=3058] Jackson would hold his ground.
[time=3060] Lee would see it and said, "There stands Jackson." Like a stone wall, an inspiration came to the rest of that Confederate army and they drove the Union forces back to the streets of Washington, D.C.
[time=3073] because somebody was standing fast.
[time=3079] Fourth principle, if you want spiritual maturity, it requires not only staying cautious but standing committed.
[time=3091] Verse six and then seven.
[time=3095] So then just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him, rooted and build up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness.
[time=3110] Before you can have the particulars of this principle, you've got to know the prerequisite.
[time=3115] Many times when you go to college, there's a class you would like to take.
[time=3119] I went to the University of Akron and I looked at the catalog.
[time=3122] They had a class in Civil War history and I saw that.
[time=3127] I went to the Register's office and I said, "I want to take Civil War history." And they said, "You cannot take Civil War history." First you have to have general U.S. history.
[time=3139] That's a prerequisite for entering Civil War history class.
[time=3144] Some of you want the fruit of spiritual maturity but you can't have it.
[time=3150] There's a prerequisite and it's found in verse six that says, "So then just as you have received Christ." Before you can ever have this next principle, you must first have Jesus Christ living in your heart.
[time=3165] You've got to be in the words of the Lord born again.
[time=3169] Some of your exposure to Christianity has been far too much to the left.
[time=3174] We might use a labral liberal and you've not been taught that you're accountable to God and that Christ died for your sins.
[time=3181] And you must believe on Him and receive Him in your heart.
[time=3184] And you've not met this prerequisite.
[time=3186] And today you need to be born again.
[time=3189] Others of us here have been to the right.
[time=3192] We've been in the conservative churches but we've had the sausage syndrome.
[time=3198] One fine American historian said that law and sausage are a lot alike.
[time=3204] You don't want to see how either one of them are made.
[time=3208] You see when you have sausage you've got this big machine and you can just put anything in there you want.
[time=3213] You can put good meat, you can put bad meat.
[time=3216] You can put meat, you can put fat, you can put parts.
[time=3219] You know, you just put it in this item and you crank it out no matter what you put in.
[time=3224] It all comes out the other end, sausage.
[time=3227] And we and evangelical churches have cranked out a lot of sausage.
[time=3233] We have processed people who've grown up in church and somebody said along the line, "Pray this prayer.
[time=3239] Now I lay me down to sleep." And they pray, "Now I lay me down to sleep." Then somebody said, "Pray this. Jesus come into my heart." And they pray, "Jesus come into their heart." And they've only been processed.
[time=3249] And they've never met the person of Christ.
[time=3252] There's a prerequisite here for spiritual maturity.
[time=3254] You've got to know Christ.
[time=3256] Now here's the particulars.
[time=3257] There's four of them.
[time=3258] Warren Wiersby says these are each are metaphors.
[time=3261] Let me borrow from Wiersby and give you his metaphors.
[time=3264] The first particular is the particular of a tree.
[time=3266] It's a being rooted.
[time=3269] Picture a tree, a plant that's roots go down.
[time=3273] The farmer was explaining to me yesterday how some of the crops you can look at.
[time=3278] And in the midst of this drought, they're green and they're producing.
[time=3282] And others of them are welding and dying.
[time=3285] The farmer explained to me the ones that are still alive were planted early.
[time=3290] And their roots go down deep, 18 inches or more.
[time=3294] And down that deep in the soil, they're still moisture.
[time=3297] And those deep roots are drawing the waters of life up.
[time=3301] The ones that have been planted more recently, their roots only go down four or six inches.
[time=3306] And the soils dry, parched, cracked open.
[time=3310] And there's no moisture.
[time=3312] The particular here of standing committed is we've got to sink our roots deep.
[time=3319] And draw from the water of life.
[time=3323] The second particular is the analogy of a building.
[time=3326] And it says not only rooted, but built up in him.
[time=3330] But before you build something up, you better build it down.
[time=3335] Don't try to build a house without putting in a strong foundation.
[time=3339] And the higher you want to go, the deeper you've got to go first.
[time=3344] I don't have the exact statistics, but I'm told the Sears Tower in Chicago, that towering skyscraper that's over 100 stories high is also over 20 stories deep.
[time=3357] Before you can go up, you've got to sink your roots down deep.
[time=3364] The third particular here is the analogy of a school, my favorite.
[time=3371] It says being strengthened in the faith as you have been taught.
[time=3376] The paphroditis had been their teacher.
[time=3378] They had had the word of God they had studied, but it wasn't enough that they had had a heritage.
[time=3383] They needed to be strengthened in it.
[time=3385] They needed to be like the student who really was equipped and prepared.
[time=3390] A couple of months ago, I did a medical internship and had the privilege of going into surgery
[time=3396] on about a half a dozen different surgeries.
[time=3398] We were in this gallbladder surgery, and this lady had been cut open and we saw that parts are indeed parts.
[time=3406] The doctor did a masterful job, stitched her back up, and he said, "What do you think?" And I said, "Oh, that was fantastic." He said, "Well, you have the medical world, a simple little principal, it goes like this.
[time=3417] See one, do one, teach one." He said, "But you've got to find your own patients." You wouldn't for a moment let a doctor take your gallbladder out on the principal.
[time=3427] See one, do one, teach one.
[time=3431] You want somebody who is thoroughly taught and thoroughly trained.
[time=3437] The Bible says here, "Be thoroughly taught, be strengthened in that faith." Don't say, "Yes, I've experienced it." Sure, I've seen it, but be thoroughly taught.
[time=3448] The final principle I hate to use on this day is the principle of a river.
[time=3455] It says, "Being overflowing with thankfulness." On this Sunday, because of the drought, the only water event, the raft race has been discontinued.
[time=3465] I hate to bring up overflowing rivers.
[time=3468] Let me just remind you of the same river in March of 1982.
[time=3473] Do you remember it then?
[time=3476] God says our life, if we want spiritual maturity, has to be overflowing like a flooded river with thankfulness.
[time=3484] If there's one area of my life that God has revealed to me a deep need for growth, it's growth in gratitude.
[time=3493] Four principles, struggling constantly, studying Christ, staying cautious and standing committed.
[time=3501] That produces spiritual maturity.
[time=3514] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and Duet, Keith and Starr Brodigam.
[time=3525] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3528] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer of repentance.
[time=3535] Will you pray with me?
[time=3538] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins, and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3548] I ask you to come in today and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3552] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3556] If you prayed this prayer today, would you write us and tell us that you prayed?
[time=3560] And we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
