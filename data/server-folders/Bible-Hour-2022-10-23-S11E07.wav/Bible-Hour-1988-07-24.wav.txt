[time=112] He had been religious all of his life.
[time=115] Baptized as a child, confirmed as an adolescent, he had taken communion in the sacraments that the church offered.
[time=124] He was its first participant.
[time=126] He had prepared for the ministry and had now entered the order as a monk.
[time=131] But with all of his religious preparation, suddenly on one tragic day, the reality of his inadequacy struck home.
[time=141] As he was walking across the field, lightning struck the ground.
[time=145] It killed the friend next to him, knocked him off of his feet.
[time=149] As he arose, he realized that religion had done nothing to prepare him to stand before God.
[time=157] And it was on that day that Martin Luther began his quest to know how could he be made acceptable before God.
[time=168] (dramatic music)
[time=180] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=183] Thank you for joining us.
[time=185] Rick's message today is taken from Colossians chapter 2 and is entitled, "The Danger of Being Religious." Martin Luther was a good and moral man.
[time=193] He also was a religious man.
[time=195] Yet Luther realized that religion could not save him.
[time=198] One of the great dangers of our day is the misunderstanding that any religious act or membership can take away our sins and make us acceptable to God.
[time=206] Today, as we study Colossians 2, we will see the danger of being religious.
[time=211] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=216] We will be looking at verses 11 through 16.
[time=219] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=224] Other special music includes a song from celebration and Kathy Hawks.
[time=232] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=240] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=245] Now, here's Rick.
[time=248] It is a joy to have you here with us today that we can sing praises to God, be encouraged in song and study the scriptures together.
[time=257] It is also a great joy to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=264] We're delighted that each one of you are here, but we particularly want to welcome one family to our church.
[time=269] It is the Tedder family.
[time=271] Tim has come to join our staff to head up our youth ministry and he's coming so that I can introduce him and he's going to introduce his family.
[time=279] Tim, welcome to Black Hawk.
[time=280] We're glad that God led you here to be on the team.
[time=284] - Thank you, Rick.
[time=286] Let me introduce the members of my family that are here this morning, Connie, my wife of eight years and partner in this ministry and seated with her, are two of our children, Cara, our oldest five years old and Caleb is three and Jared, one year old, is in the nursery, I'm sure, having a good time.
[time=301] I'm asked sometimes, when are you going to go into the real pastorate?
[time=306] In fact, the assumption was when I left Grandledge Baptist Church to continue ministry here that I was coming as a senior pastor, but Rick's still in his office, and so, I look at ministry with young people, junior and high students as a real ministry, a ministry as a pastor, and my intention in coming to Black Hawk and joining the ministry here is to be able to work in the lives of junior high and senior high students, introducing some of them to Jesus Christ, and then encouraging those who know him to continue in their relationship with him to get to know him better, to draw closer to him, to go on after junior high, after high school, to live lives of commitment to Jesus Christ to make a difference in their world.
[time=355] We've anticipated coming here, and we look forward to a number of years of ministry and the things that we believe God is going to do in blessing the work that is done here, and I would just ask you to pray, pray for us, and as you pray, remember a couple things in particular.
[time=371] Pray for our family as we make the adjustment to a new place, a new home, a new ministry, new people, and pray for the youth ministry here as I get together with the staff, gain a certain amount of comfortableness and working with the relationships and building that there, and as we plan in the next months and setting direction of where we want the youth ministry of this church to continue to go, and all of this we want God to look on it and be pleased with it.
[time=397] So I ask you if you pray with us, and thank you for the friendship and the help that many of you have already shown and are coming here.
[time=403] Thank you.
[time=403] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 209 seconds]
[time=621] - The song has two great messages.
[time=639] One, a proclamation that we're glad to be a family of God and then the invitation for you.
[time=645] You've never received Christ as Savior.
[time=648] You can indeed accept him as personal Savior and belong to the spiritual family of God.
[time=654] Talking about leadership and Tim requesting that we pray for them as they make the adjustment and we'll do that.
[time=661] We want to continue to have God lead us in the direction that he would have us to go for all of us as a family.
[time=667] Him number 407, all the way, my Savior leads me.
[time=671] We'll sing all three stanzas together.
[time=676] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 124 seconds]
[time=808] - Thank you for your good singing.
[time=812] We'll continue now with music, special music, by the group celebration.
[time=817] Let's listen and have our hearts prepared for the message that they have for us now in song.
[time=822] (soft music)
[time=842] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=1087] - We count at such a privilege that you've joined us today
[time=1096] for the Bible hour, and we trust that what we've done already by way of singing and music has been an encouragement to your heart.
[time=1103] Peter, I appreciate all you've done for our music, and I'm glad you get to go on vacation.
[time=1108] - Well, I'm looking forward to it, Rick.
[time=1110] We're beginning, we're leaving tomorrow to go to a reunion in California with all of my family, and it's always a good time of rest and relaxation, as well as that one year opportunity to see my folks.
[time=1121] - Well, I'm glad you get to go and hope you have a great time.
[time=1123] - Thank you.
[time=1124] - While you're gone, we have Brenda Whitfield coming.
[time=1126] - Brenda is right here from Fort Wayne, and has come to Blackhawk a couple times, and always gives a lot of enthusiasm to the service, and sings beautifully, by the way, and has great variety.
[time=1138] She is a fine young lady and is doing very well in the music field, and we always enjoy having her come, and she's coming July 31st all day.
[time=1147] - Well, as you're watching this, we hope that you can make plans to be with us either in the morning worship services at 9.30 and 10.50, or for the evening service when Brenda will have more time to sing at six o'clock, that's on Sunday, July the 31st.
[time=1162] Also, we want to invite you to join us on the Wednesday nights of August.
[time=1167] We offer them what we call here at Blackhawk, the practical living seminars.
[time=1171] These seminars are put on by the people of our church who, by their experience, education, or employment, have an expertise in a field such as how to have a daily quiet time, or how to manage your finances, how to deal with worry and stress.
[time=1187] These will be going on for four Wednesday nights at seven o'clock.
[time=1191] So we hope that you'll make plans to join us on the Wednesday nights excuse me of August for the practical living seminars.
[time=1200] And then coming up in October is the dedication of our new facility and a lot of special things planned for that.
[time=1207] - Rick, there's a lot of progress being made on our new building and we're just counting the number of weeks now until we are able to occupy that building.
[time=1215] But on October 14th, 15th, and 16th will be our dedication.
[time=1219] We'll be having Nielsen and Young dual pianists with us on Friday evening and that's going to be a great night of music.
[time=1225] They are just fabulous.
[time=1227] - Well, we're looking forward to that and then our founding pastor, David Jeremiah, will be here for Saturday night and we'll hear him speak and then David burn him on Sunday morning.
[time=1237] Before we go back to our morning worship service, we have a booklet to share with you that we hope will help you to be able to have a discerning mind and heart as so many new religious concepts are brought to the foreground and somebody says, "Oh, this is the truth." We're living in a time where there is a new cult arriving on this scene every day.
[time=1259] So to help you discern, we have this booklet called Strange Cults in America to share with you.
[time=1266] If you would like a copy of this booklet, we would be glad to send it to you today as a gift from us to you.
[time=1273] We simply ask you to write us, give us your name and address.
[time=1277] We have the books in stock and we'll send them to you yet this week.
[time=1281] So please do write and request the booklet called Strange Cults in America and we'll send you your copy.
[time=1287] Our address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1296] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1305] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=1308] Pete, I hope you have a great vacation and I hope you'll be back with us next Sunday.
[time=1338] [MUSIC - 224 seconds]
[time=1582] We are seeking to encourage one another to develop the habit of scripture memory, and to do that, we encourage each other to memorize the verse of the week. If you're visiting with us, that verse is printed in your bulletin at the bottom on the inside. We'd invite you to join with us in reading that. Would you stand please now as we recite the verse for this week?
[time=1602] Colossians two nine, four in Christ, all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form. Colossians two nine. Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1620] [MUSIC]
[time=1639] My days are filled with laughter. My heart has known your peace. I've traveled far, still there is far to go, but in my heart there is a longing to look upon your face.
[time=1665] Where you are is where I want to be. You are my key. You are the land, the lion, the Judah, the seat of Abraham.
[time=1691] The holy one, God's only son. You are the king of whom I am.
[time=1716] And every road I've traveled down. You have walked before me. You made the light to shine in the darkness. And I am looking for the day when I bow before you.
[time=1741] And lay my crowns at your feet. Oh Jesus, you are my king. You are the land, the lion, the Judah, the seat of Abraham.
[time=1768] The holy one, God's only son. You are the king of whom I am. You are my king.
[time=1789] You are the land, the lion, the Judah, the seat of Abraham. The holy one, God's only son. You are the king of whom I am.
[time=1816] You are the king of whom I am.
[time=1833] Lord Jesus, we worship you today because you are the king, the lion of Judah, the seat of Abraham. God's holy one, you are the king of whom I am.
[time=1848] Father, we come today to this place to, in a fresh way, re-surrender our lives to you to say you are the king. And we worship you and we pledge our lives to your service.
[time=1865] And may we be found faithful this week in serving you as master and king. And we today come to worship you as Lord and God.
[time=1877] And as we study your word, we do not want to know anything but what your will and your way for our life should be.
[time=1887] And so today we ask you to rekindle the flames of our allegiance, to strike a fresh match and to set our spirits a flame.
[time=1897] So today, God, it is your day and these are your moments and we want to hear your word spoken by your spirit to our spirit, something more than a man behind a pulpit and people in chairs.
[time=1916] God, you move in our hearts, make a message come alive and may it begin in me.
[time=1926] We pray that you would strengthen the commitment of Christians who are going through the discouraging days of doubt.
[time=1934] We pray that you would answer prayer not only for the prayer sake that is needed but for the spiritual sake of the one asking it that they might know that you are powerful.
[time=1945] We pray today that you would give comfort to those who are walking through afflicting times.
[time=1952] We pray for a family who is going through a great valley of discouragement with a son.
[time=1958] We pray for a son that he might truly be repentant.
[time=1962] We pray today for those who are struggling with alcohol that they might find that their master is Jesus and not that which they drink.
[time=1973] We pray today for those who are on the verge of marital infidelity that they might have a greater desire to be faithful to you and to their spouse.
[time=1986] We pray that you will give us a hunger for purity and most of all we pray that you would give us a desire to please you more than our appetites.
[time=1996] We ask you today to put your hand in your strengthening grip on the lives of those considering compromise.
[time=2005] Pray this morning for Harry Bennett and George Wilson as they recover from surgical procedures.
[time=2012] Pray for encouragement to their heart and particularly to Virginia Doty as she battles with depression.
[time=2019] Now, God, as we open your word, we open our hearts first to you.
[time=2024] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2029] If ever there was a religious man, it was he.
[time=2035] He had been baptized as a baby.
[time=2039] That's the thing to do, wasn't it?
[time=2041] He had grown up in a home where obedience to God and the church were stressed.
[time=2047] That's important, wasn't it?
[time=2050] As a young man, he was confirmed in his adolescence.
[time=2054] That's important, wasn't it?
[time=2058] If there ever was a religious man, he qualified.
[time=2062] He had set his devotion and his academics pursuits on theology in the study of God.
[time=2069] If ever there was a religious man, it was he.
[time=2073] He had entered into a strict training of preparation for service in the church.
[time=2078] He had selected the right monastic order and now he was a graduate.
[time=2083] If ever there was a religious man, it was he.
[time=2089] Now, as a monkey walked across an open field of Germany, close to a friend,
[time=2097] lightning lit up the sky and then struck the ground in front of them.
[time=2101] He was knocked off of his feet.
[time=2104] His friend was knocked dead.
[time=2108] From that moment on, this young German monk struggled with the brevity of life
[time=2115] and the certainty of death and the nagging question, "How can he, a sinful man, be made acceptable in the eyes of a righteous God?"
[time=2128] The struggle drove him to the scriptures and the spirit led him to Romans 1, verse 17,
[time=2135] where he read, "The just shall live by faith." And this religious man, Martin Luther, gave his heart to Jesus Christ because his religion could not save him.
[time=2151] You see, being religious is not enough.
[time=2155] A matter of fact, being religious may not be to your advantage.
[time=2160] It may be a disadvantage.
[time=2163] In fact, being religious may be a dangerous thing because religion teaches us to trust in the system and not in the Savior.
[time=2176] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=2181] We studied from this chapter last week.
[time=2183] Please take a moment if you have a Bible to find Colossians chapter 2.
[time=2188] Something you could study with us. Open your Bible to the table of contents at the front if you're not familiar with Colossians.
[time=2195] And I'll read for you Colossians chapter 2 verses 11 through 17.
[time=2203] In him Christ, you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by hands of men,
[time=2218] but with the circumcision done by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead.
[time=2232] When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ.
[time=2242] He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code with its regulations that was against us and that stood opposed to us.
[time=2254] He took it away, nailing it to the cross, and having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross.
[time=2273] Therefore, do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink or with regard to religious festival, a new moon celebration, or a Sabbath day.
[time=2288] These are a shadow of the things that were to come, the reality, however, is found in Christ.
[time=2299] Webster defines religion in this way, a service and adoration of God, any one of the systems of faith and worship,
[time=2312] profession and/or practice of religious beliefs, religious observances collectively.
[time=2320] Good definition of religion, but I like what E. Stanley Jones said.
[time=2325] He said religion is man's attempt to somehow reach up to God, and Christianity is God's attempt to reach down to mankind.
[time=2339] And therein is all the difference. Religion says you must do this to reach God, and Christianity says God has done this already to reach you.
[time=2355] Religion and righteous deeds often lead us to trust in ourselves and to fill the sea, our inadequacies, and our shortcomings.
[time=2368] If there were ever a religious group of people, it would have been the people of Israel of the Old Testament.
[time=2375] They were religious down to the details, but these stern words of warning come from their own prophet, Isaiah, who said,
[time=2386] "These people come near me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
[time=2396] Their worship of me is made up with the rules taught by men."
[time=2403] It's how God lamented the religiousness of Isaiah's day.
[time=2409] More graphically, Isaiah puts it this way. All of our righteous deeds are like filthy rags.
[time=2417] Men, do you have one of those little buckets in your garage like I have?
[time=2421] I've got a bucket of rags, and these are the rags that, you know, when you change the oil and it runs down your arm,
[time=2428] you wipe it off with that ragging, and there's still one little clean spot on it, so you throw it in the barrel.
[time=2433] You're going to use that some day. I've got about 20 rags that if I brought them in the house to put them in the washing machine,
[time=2441] Kathy would skip the word divorce and go right on to murder. I mean, it'd be over. I mean, these are rags, filthy rags.
[time=2451] Now, picture you've just injured yourself and you've cut a gash right on your arm.
[time=2456] The blood is coming out and some other tissue that you didn't even know you had.
[time=2461] Can you imagine reaching into that rag bucket and pulling out those rags and say, pah, that'll stop the bleeding.
[time=2469] That'll help. God says your spiritual need is like an open moon and you take all of your righteous deeds
[time=2477] like a filthy rag and you stick them and say, oh, that's better.
[time=2482] The very best that we can do, our best righteousness, God says, it's filthiness, unacceptable to him.
[time=2489] Jesus even put it this way.
[time=2492] Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Pharisees, you will in no way enter in the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2502] Nobody was more religious. Nobody was more self-righteous than the Pharisees.
[time=2508] To give you one example, the Pharisees taught that the Sabbath was a Sabbath and you couldn't work on the Sabbath.
[time=2515] That's in the law, but they got down to interpreting it.
[time=2519] If you threw water out the window, that's work because you see when the water goes out the window, it lands on the ground.
[time=2528] It might perchance land on the seed cause the seed to grow.
[time=2532] Growing seeds is farming and farming's work so you don't throw the water out the window on the Sabbath.
[time=2537] I want to tell you, the Pharisees were religious and they're also boring.
[time=2542] I mean, could you imagine living like that?
[time=2545] But Jesus comes along and says, hey, these guys aren't making it.
[time=2549] Unless your righteousness exceeds these people, you're not going to heaven.
[time=2555] And in case somebody thought of themselves, hey, I'm more religious than those guys, Jesus elevated the standard one more time.
[time=2564] Matthew 548, he said, be ye therefore perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
[time=2574] If being religious and being moral can save you, it'll only save you if you're absolutely perfect.
[time=2581] And before you say I am, we would like to hear your spouse's vote first.
[time=2587] None of us are perfect, and that's God's standard.
[time=2592] And there's no religious system that says you can be good enough to climb your way up the religious ladder to God.
[time=2601] Being religious is a dangerous thing.
[time=2605] William Booth was the founder of the Salvation Army.
[time=2608] He wrote this on the verge of the 20th century.
[time=2613] He said, I consider the chief danger which will confront the 20th century will be religion without the Holy Spirit, Christianity without Christ, forgiveness without regeneration, morality without God, and heaven without hell.
[time=2639] Strangely prophetic, because most of us today hold to a form of religion, but we don't want God to be present in the Holy Spirit.
[time=2648] We certainly uphold the name Christianity, but most would denounce that they believed Christ was God.
[time=2654] Everybody wants heaven, nobody certainly believes in hell.
[time=2660] Religion is the great danger of our generation.
[time=2666] We came across this phrase.
[time=2670] See to it that no one takes you captive.
[time=2673] Don't be held hostage.
[time=2676] He said, by the deceptive hollow philosophy.
[time=2680] That really was a reference chiefly to this group of people who were called Gnostics.
[time=2686] The word Gnostic is Greek to know.
[time=2689] They taught, we know things you don't know, and unless you know what we know, you don't know what you need to know.
[time=2695] And they taught a philosophy and a religious structure.
[time=2699] And so here are two words of warning.
[time=2702] Don't be taken captive by philosophy.
[time=2705] Don't be taken captive by religion.
[time=2708] This week we'll study verses 11 through 17 being taken captive by religion.
[time=2713] Can I boil that down to two simple statements?
[time=2716] Statement number one.
[time=2718] Don't be taken captive by religious systems.
[time=2721] Verse 11 speaks about a religious system.
[time=2725] It was the Hebrew faith that said you must follow this system to be acceptable before God.
[time=2733] And the whole emphasis on the system is what you must do and that's a religion and Christianity is a relationship that tells you what God has done.
[time=2744] And here Paul tells us not three things you must do but three things God has already done.
[time=2751] The first is this in verse 11.
[time=2753] In him you were also circumcised.
[time=2757] Circumcision was the sign of your allegiance to the covenant of the Old Testament.
[time=2765] Christ came and gave a brand new covenant.
[time=2771] And with this new covenant it was not said now you go and keep the covenant and you go and perform the sign.
[time=2780] Christ said I've got something better than the sign of circumcision.
[time=2784] He says I will perform a circumcision on you that's different from the Old Testament circumcision in three obvious ways.
[time=2793] One this is putting off of the sinful nature not a piece of physical tissue.
[time=2801] God says what's going to be cut away this time is that old nature that's within you God says I will cut it away because you can't.
[time=2809] Secondly it's different because it's not done by some surgical procedure by men but Christ does it for you, not you doing it for him.
[time=2819] And thirdly it's demonstrated by a new sign and that of baptism.
[time=2827] Baptism is a picture that I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins.
[time=2833] And I so believe that that I want a watching world to know.
[time=2837] And so here is a picture.
[time=2839] I am lowered into the water in that picture that I believe Jesus died for my sins and that he was buried.
[time=2845] And as I'm raised out of the water it's a picture that I believe that he rose again powerfully proving he was God.
[time=2854] Christianity is a relationship not a religion because it's not me doing something.
[time=2859] It's God doing something for me.
[time=2861] The first thing he does is he cuts away my old nature.
[time=2865] The second thing the Bible says that he does is this.
[time=2869] He makes us alive.
[time=2873] Verse 13.
[time=2875] When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature God made you alive with Christ.
[time=2887] There's three ways you can be dead.
[time=2890] The first and the most obvious way you can be dead is to be physically dead.
[time=2895] The second way is to be spiritually dead.
[time=2899] You see when you were born you came alive physically.
[time=2903] You came alive emotionally.
[time=2905] You came alive mentally slowly in some cases but you came alive mentally.
[time=2911] But you did not come alive spiritually.
[time=2915] You do not come alive spiritually until a second birth, a new birth Jesus called it being born again.
[time=2922] That's when your spirit comes alive.
[time=2925] There is a third death, physical death, spiritual death.
[time=2930] If you're born physically and you're never born spiritually when you die physically you'll be dead eternally.
[time=2937] An eternal death is the third death.
[time=2940] But if you're born physically and you're born spiritually you'll live eternally.
[time=2947] Here the Bible says that when you were dead what's dead is that?
[time=2951] Well it's not eternity you're still physically alive.
[time=2954] It's not physical death it's spiritual.
[time=2957] While you were spiritually dead alienated from God because of your sin and this old nature God did something for you.
[time=2966] And that is he made you come alive.
[time=2970] Your spirit for the first time will come alive when you give your heart to Christ.
[time=2978] The third thing this passage says that God does for us he forgives us our sins.
[time=2986] Verse 13 the last phrase he forgave us all our sins having canceled the written code with its regulations that was against us that stood opposed to us
[time=2999] and he took it away and he nailed it to the cross.
[time=3003] Now the apostle Paul is giving a full picture here and it's very depictive.
[time=3009] He not only says Christ forgave us but here's how he did it he canceled the written code.
[time=3016] The phrase written code is actually a technical accounting term that speaks of a note that is written out that we would call an IOU.
[time=3028] And the debtor is each of us and God says I've got a written code here.
[time=3034] It's an IOU and at least the law at least every infraction and the payment you must make which is death.
[time=3044] And the Bible says Christ canceled the written code.
[time=3051] In the point of US history it became illegal to drink on or manufacture alcohol that was a law.
[time=3061] There came another amendment which canceled that amendment and now it is legal.
[time=3068] God says I've taken and I've canceled the Old Testament law because it was an IOU against each of you.
[time=3076] Not only did he cancel it but the Bible says that he took it away he removed it from our presence.
[time=3083] One of my first desires after a report card that was less than glowing was to not only have my parents see it and get that over with
[time=3096] but get that report card out of their sight and mine as fast as I could less any memories are stirred up.
[time=3105] God says I'll not only cancel but I'll take it and I'll remove it and he says I'll nail it to the cross it's dead.
[time=3113] And then he says I'll take all of the powers that render the law and Christ will lead them in a triumphal procession.
[time=3120] It's a picture like Caesar who moved north and west and conquered Gaul.
[time=3125] And now he comes back as a general triumphantly leading the army and showing the hostages that were taken.
[time=3132] He said I'll hold them as my hostage showing that I'm triumphing over them.
[time=3138] Don't be taken captive by a religious system.
[time=3142] Religion is you and me trying to reach up to God and the reality of it all is God has already done it all.
[time=3150] He has reached down to us.
[time=3152] The second statement of this warning is this don't be taken captive by religious people.
[time=3158] If the system doesn't get you some people will.
[time=3161] Verse 16 therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink or with regard to the religious festivals.
[time=3169] No moon's Sabbath days.
[time=3173] The individuals here involved are religious people who are part of the system and who make it their habit to judge other people and say oh that's not spiritual.
[time=3183] You shouldn't have done that.
[time=3185] Did you eat that stuff?
[time=3187] Why no true Christian would have ever have drank that.
[time=3191] Where were you at last week's Thursday night service?
[time=3195] Why you violated the covenant?
[time=3199] Religious people.
[time=3201] You see religious people are like ferryboat owners the day the new bridge opens.
[time=3207] They're out of business.
[time=3209] I mean who's going to take an old ferryboat across when you can just drive your car straight over the new bridge?
[time=3216] Religious people are forever going to try to recapture their market.
[time=3221] They're sure of the business.
[time=3223] Just like Demetrius the silversmith who hated Paul's preaching the gospel because when people came to Christ they stopped buying the silver idols he had.
[time=3235] Don't let somebody who's religious recapture you into a religious system.
[time=3240] The issues they named five of them here. One is what you eat. The religious people had a kosher diet.
[time=3246] Oh if you're really spiritual even though you came to Christ you won't eat bacon.
[time=3251] That's not kosher.
[time=3253] But it may have been weak Christians who said oh this is delightful meat.
[time=3257] Where did you buy this?
[time=3259] And you say Demetrius and sons deli.
[time=3262] Demetrius and sons deli.
[time=3264] Why that Demetrius he offers that meat every night before he sells it to the pagan gods.
[time=3270] I can't eat it.
[time=3272] The host says yes you can. You just did.
[time=3275] And there would be weak Christians saying oh I can't eat that.
[time=3279] And there'll be somebody judging saying don't you dare.
[time=3284] Or maybe it wasn't a cedic who said oh these Jews don't eat pork.
[time=3289] These Christians don't eat beef off of the idols. They're not spiritual.
[time=3293] I'm spiritual. I don't eat meat.
[time=3297] Religious people making an issue over food.
[time=3301] Religious people making an issue over what you drink. Oh don't drink that.
[time=3305] There was one prohibition in the Old Testament. The Nazarite was not to drink wine.
[time=3310] Now there would be those who would say oh if you really want to go to heaven you can never do that.
[time=3315] Make an issue of it. Those that made an issue over the festivals.
[time=3319] You must keep the festivals. You weren't at the banquet for the feast of the Passover.
[time=3324] You weren't at the banquet for the feast of the lights.
[time=3327] You weren't at the banquet for the feast of the unleavened breads.
[time=3330] I want to tell you something. If you're having the banquet invite me I'll come.
[time=3334] But their point was you're not religious enough.
[time=3339] There were those that made a big deal over new moons.
[time=3343] Because that's when a sacrifice was supposed to be made.
[time=3347] Those that made an issue over the Sabbath. We have more confusion over the Sabbath than anything.
[time=3353] First of all the Sabbath has nothing to do with worship.
[time=3357] The Sabbath day was to be a day of rest.
[time=3360] And anyone who believes that going to church is a day of rest has never been to this place before.
[time=3366] The Old Testament taught a Sabbath which was to be a day of ceasing from your labors.
[time=3372] In the New Testament the Christian says Jesus arose on Sunday morning.
[time=3377] So on the first morning of the week they began to worship.
[time=3380] Now whatever you do don't try to call Sunday the Sabbath. It's not.
[time=3384] And if you want to make the day of worship the Sabbath you're not doing what the Old Testament said either.
[time=3390] The best thing that you can do is to say I'm a free man in Christ and I don't have to regard one day over the other.
[time=3397] I just need to obey him. Issues brought up by people.
[time=3404] And the real importance is found in verse 17. It says this.
[time=3409] All of these are a shadow of the things that were to come.
[time=3414] The reality however is Christ.
[time=3417] Do you ever see people do silhouette drawings?
[time=3421] You take a person here, you shine a light there and you see the silhouette back there.
[time=3426] That silhouette is not me. That's just a shadow of me.
[time=3432] The law all that's been said was just a shadow of faint representation waiting for the reality which was Christ.
[time=3442] And the whole issue is not.
[time=3445] Do you worship on Saturday? Do you worship on Sunday?
[time=3448] Do you throw water out the window or don't you on the Sabbath?
[time=3451] The issue is not do you eat certain things or do you not eat certain things?
[time=3456] The issue is not what is it you drink? What is it that you drink?
[time=3459] The issue is Jesus Christ.
[time=3462] Because religion cannot save you. It cannot save anybody.
[time=3468] The only thing, the only thing that can save anyone is Jesus Christ.
[time=3475] And faith in Him alone. Religion cannot save you.
[time=3481] And it cannot add one thing to your salvation.
[time=3485] If you look back what we studied last week in verse 9 it says for in Christ.
[time=3489] All the fullness of deity lives in bodily form and you have been given fullness in Christ.
[time=3497] You don't need religion to add one thing to Christ. He is all you need.
[time=3505] [MUSIC]
[time=3516] We've been sharing with you today the ministry and music from celebration and soloist Kathy Hawks.
[time=3522] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3525] Pastor Rick talked about the difference between being religious and having an experience knowing Jesus Christ's personal Savior.
[time=3532] If you've never accepted Christ before we close today I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you asking Jesus to come into your heart.
[time=3541] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3548] Today I know that I have a need for Christ to come in and to forgive me and cleanse me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3554] I ask you to come into my heart today and be my Savior. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3562] If you prayed that prayer with me this morning would you write us and tell us that you made a decision for Jesus Christ.
[time=3568] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
