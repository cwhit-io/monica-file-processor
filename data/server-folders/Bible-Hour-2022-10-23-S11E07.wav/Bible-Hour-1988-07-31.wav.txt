[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=60] Jim Thorpe has been heralded as one of the greatest if not the greatest athlete of all time.
[time=72] He was the first man ever to win both the Decathlon and the Pentathlon in the same Olympics.
[time=79] But it all came tumbling crashing down in a moment when he was disqualified for both past and future Olympic games
[time=88] because he failed to compete according to the rules.
[time=94] His medals were revoked and his future taken away.
[time=99] Colossians gives us this strict warning.
[time=103] See to it that no one disqualifies you from the prize.
[time=109] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=127] Thank you for joining us.
[time=129] Rick's message today is entitled The Not So Mysterious Mystics and is taken from the book of Colossians.
[time=135] Colossians gives us this clear warning.
[time=137] Don't let anyone disqualify you from the prize.
[time=141] There is nothing more discouraging than a believer in Christ who is disqualified from winning the prize because he has been misled by false teachers.
[time=148] This representation of God's word comes in many varieties but the effect is still the same.
[time=154] Today as we study Colossians 2 we are instructed to guard ourselves from the Not So Mystical Mystics.
[time=161] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=166] You will be looking at verses 18 and 19.
[time=170] Our special music today includes a song from the sanctuary choir and a musical package from
[time=177] our special guest, Brenda Whitfield.
[time=181] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=190] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=195] Now here's Rick.
[time=197] And we also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=203] We trust that as we sing and as we listen to music and as we study the Scriptures your life will be edified build up in your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=213] One of the great questions is this and can it be that I should gain an interest in the
[time=221] Savior's name.
[time=223] Those are the words of Charles Wesley as he put it to pen and a great hymn that brings our attention to that we are not worthy except that Jesus Christ died for our sins and that's
[time=235] the only way we will ever gain eternal life.
[time=238] I hope you'll listen and enjoy and be taught by our choir as they sing for us that great
[time=244] Wesley and hymn and can it be.
[time=253] Amazing love.
[time=258] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=269] We let his heart arise from the light.
[time=283] So breathe so holy in their disgrace.
[time=298] Amazing love.
[time=318] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=341] And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's love.
[time=370] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=385] Amazing love.
[time=396] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=406] Amazing love.
[time=417] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=425] No condemnation, now I pray.
[time=434] Jesus and all in Him is mine.
[time=441] All I did knew, all I did knew, my living hand.
[time=451] And flow in the jestess divine.
[time=460] All I approach, Peter, no problem.
[time=468] And play the crowd through dry soil.
[time=477] Amazing love.
[time=482] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=489] Amazing love.
[time=492] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=499] Amazing love.
[time=511] How can it be the pom-a-dah to start for me.
[time=518] [AMEN - 15 seconds]
[time=539] Let's continue our singing now by turning him number 651.
[time=547] We'll sing together stanzas one, two, and four.
[time=556] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=685] Thank you for that fine singing this morning.
[time=687] Our special musical guest this morning is Brenda Whitfield.
[time=691] She is a four-way native.
[time=693] She and her husband Richard also have a daughter named Precious.
[time=697] She is here to minister to us today in song.
[time=700] Brenda, the Lord bless you as you minister today.
[time=705] [MUSIC]
[time=729] Remembering so well the day that I met you.
[time=736] [MUSIC]
[time=741] Who took me in your arms and calls dreams to come true.
[time=750] For the fear of what would be.
[time=754] You came and rescued me.
[time=758] Lord I pray today for the rest of my life.
[time=767] Live inside my heart.
[time=770] Please stay for always.
[time=775] Till that timeless place when we're face to face.
[time=785] And will it break for our own way.
[time=793] Oh yes.
[time=795] [MUSIC]
[time=807] I look ahead and see for you that I'm a crime.
[time=815] [MUSIC]
[time=819] Some high and some low, but you lead.
[time=826] I'll go.
[time=829] And at the end I'll see.
[time=833] You are always there with me.
[time=837] Lord I pray today for the rest of my life.
[time=846] Live inside my heart.
[time=849] Please stay for always.
[time=855] Till that timeless place when we're face to face.
[time=865] And will it break for always.
[time=875] Lord I pray today for the rest of my life.
[time=883] Live inside my heart.
[time=886] Please stay for always.
[time=894] Till that timeless place when we're face to face.
[time=904] Oh I'm so excited about seeing you Lord.
[time=910] And will it break.
[time=913] I want to love you for always.
[time=921] Here I am Lord I want to see you.
[time=928] And will it break for always.
[time=941] [MUSIC]
[time=946] Hello again and we are so thankful that you have joined us today here for the Bible Hour.
[time=953] This Sunday morning we broadcast to you live our Sunday morning worship services.
[time=959] Live all but these few moments where we can talk directly as a television family.
[time=964] I want to express my gratitude that you've joined us today.
[time=968] And that's our sincere desire and prayer that God will use this time together to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as a believer.
[time=977] Or if you're a searcher that perhaps today you would give your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=982] As the broadcast ends in a few moments we'll give you an opportunity to pray and ask Christ to come in to your heart.
[time=991] But now let me just give you a brief update on some coming events that we hope you will be able to join us for.
[time=998] First of all coming up in October which is just two months away will be the dedication of our new worship center.
[time=1005] It will be a new home not only for the Blackhawk Baptist Church but also for the Bible Hour.
[time=1011] The new sanctuary should open in late September and the dedication services are scheduled for the 14th, 15th and 16th of October.
[time=1021] On the 15th we'll be having the two great keyboard artists Nielsen and Young.
[time=1027] Then on Saturday we'll have our former pastor and founder David Jeremiah. He will be back to celebrate with us.
[time=1035] And then on Sunday we'll have our final dedication event with Dr. David Burnham.
[time=1041] David Burnham will spend the month of September ministering to athletes at the Olympics as he heads up an international sports coalition
[time=1049] bringing sports ministries from around the world to Seoul Korea there to minister the gospel to thousands of athletes
[time=1057] so that they can in turn go home as ambassadors for Christ.
[time=1061] We're looking forward to those three dates and want to encourage you to set them aside.
[time=1065] Those are October 14th, 15th and 16th.
[time=1070] Also today we want to encourage you to write in for an excellent helpful little book that's entitled Strange Cults in America.
[time=1079] This booklet focuses in on some of the dangers that we'll be talking about in today's message.
[time=1085] There is a spirit that says there's got to be something more something deeper something mystical and I have to have it.
[time=1093] In our study today we'll discover that God says don't let anybody disqualify you from the prize and he warns against mysticism.
[time=1103] And because of that interest in our own human minds we have delved into places that we would do better to avoid.
[time=1111] This booklet will help you to have a handle on the truth and we want to send it as our gift to you free and postage paid.
[time=1118] If you will simply write and let us know of your request.
[time=1122] Write to us today at the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1136] Let me repeat that one more time.
[time=1138] The Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1148] We do hope you'll write. We'd love to hear from you. Your comments would just be treasured and we'll be glad to send you this booklet if you'll simply write for the booklet titled Strange Cults in America.
[time=1161] Before we go back to our morning worship service allow me to invite you to our Wednesday worship service for some special events that we call the practical living seminar.
[time=1172] We ask people who are part of our ministry here who because of their education or experience have developed somewhat of an expertise on the given field to teach that for four Wednesday nights in the month of August.
[time=1186] We'll be covering from a financial planner biblical concepts about managing our personal finances.
[time=1193] We'll hear from a couple who've overcome some serious battles in depression.
[time=1197] How the Lord has helped them.
[time=1199] We'll hear from a professional career planner how you can manage your future and think about job planning in the days ahead.
[time=1206] One seminar will be on how to have a quiet time and then we'll have the film series with Dr. James Dobson called Focus on the Family.
[time=1215] Well you'll have to choose you can't go to all those but you can choose to come on Wednesday nights at seven o'clock here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1225] Now as we go back to our morning worship service we're looking forward to hearing from Brenda Whitfield once again.
[time=1233] Thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1245] How excellent is sign name oh Lord how excellent is sign name?
[time=1251] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is sign name?
[time=1256] How excellent is sign name oh Lord how excellent is sign name?
[time=1261] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is sign name?
[time=1266] I look into the midnight blue and see the works you've done.
[time=1271] Your children raise a perfect phrase while enemies hold their tongues.
[time=1276] Creation shows your splinter, your reigning majesty.
[time=1281] And yet I find you take the time to care for one like me.
[time=1286] How excellent is sign name oh Lord how excellent is sign name?
[time=1291] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is sign name?
[time=1296] How excellent is sign name oh Lord how excellent is sign name?
[time=1302] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is sign name?
[time=1307] Well we'll find day when the trumpets play and the dead in Christ will arise.
[time=1312] The chosen few will gather to proclaim your Lord most time.
[time=1317] With shouts of hallelujahs the heavenly host will sing.
[time=1322] Every knee will bow, every tongue will shout.
[time=1325] You're the king of king.
[time=1327] How excellent is sign name oh Lord how excellent is sign name?
[time=1332] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is sign name?
[time=1337] How excellent is sign name oh Lord how excellent is sign name?
[time=1342] Heaven and earth together proclaim how excellent is sign name?
[time=1347] How excellent is sign name?
[time=1356] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1373] [MUSIC]
[time=1387] The disciples were in the upper room.
[time=1393] They didn't know that Jesus would be leaving very soon.
[time=1400] They talked about his kingdom as they read it for the feast.
[time=1407] Who would be the greatest and who would be the least?
[time=1415] But one said there's a great test.
[time=1419] I hope that I'm the one.
[time=1422] And others talked of miracles which they had seen or done.
[time=1429] But no one noticed Jesus as he rose up from his seat.
[time=1435] Until he knelt before them and began to wash their feet.
[time=1442] He said I've come to serve you.
[time=1456] And if you know my mother's love the way you say you've been you should serve each other too.
[time=1473] I wish I could have been there to see the look upon each man's face.
[time=1484] A single act of service puts us all back in our place.
[time=1491] And yet we're called to minister and do Mary calls in his name.
[time=1498] Remember when you're sent by him the reason that he came.
[time=1505] He said I've come to serve you and you.
[time=1513] I've come to serve you.
[time=1519] And if you know my mother's love the way you say you've been you should serve each other too.
[time=1535] Yes, I've come to serve you.
[time=1543] I've come to serve you and you.
[time=1549] And if you know my mother's love the way you say you've been you should serve each other too.
[time=1564] Yes, you should serve each other too.
[time=1575] I'll like we'll serve you and you.
[time=1595] Father thank you for the refreshment of our spirit that we receive when we give to you the worship do your name.
[time=1609] Thank you for this reminder that we have the perfect model in Christ and he teaches us to serve one another.
[time=1621] Thank you for those who are serving us right now by cradling our children in the nursery.
[time=1628] Teaching our toddlers songs that honor you, instructing our children in the principles of your word.
[time=1637] Thank you for those who have served us already by coming early to prepare a building on a maintenance staff
[time=1644] or to greet us at the door and assist us out of our car as ushers.
[time=1649] Thank you for those who labor to make things happen that we only notice if they don't.
[time=1656] Sound and production people, lighting and cameramen, engineers and technicians.
[time=1662] Thank you for those who serve us.
[time=1666] Father make of us willing servants.
[time=1671] We love you and as we worship you today we ask you to refresh us and renew us
[time=1677] so that with a rekindled allegiance we might serve you this week.
[time=1684] We pray that you would give strength to our missionaries and particularly our students who are on a new adventure this summer.
[time=1693] We pray for those who are serving in short term missions like the gals who went to Manila
[time=1700] for Wendy and Denine and Shelley for Jim and Hong Kong and Christie and Papua New Guinea
[time=1706] and we are thankful for Jodi serving in Egypt and God renew them and keep them safe.
[time=1713] Father we pray for the Coles as they will be moving across the town that you will give strength to them in transition.
[time=1721] We pray for have southwell that you'll give her doctors wisdom to treat her that they'll be able to return to Portugal quickly.
[time=1729] We pray for some of our missionaries who serve in this country for Lori that you would encourage her heart.
[time=1736] And father for each one here who serves you may they find this hour to be an hour of refreshment.
[time=1743] We ask for your comfort for Bonnie Johnson and their family and the death of her father.
[time=1749] We ask for strength for the burk holders as Julie now undergoes chemotherapy.
[time=1755] We ask your hand to be upon Jeanetta Wiggins sister as she recovers from open heart surgery.
[time=1762] We ask for strength for those who are discouraged.
[time=1766] Energy for those who are weary.
[time=1769] And for each of us a loyalty to Christ so that we will not be disqualified from the prize.
[time=1778] For we ask it in Jesus name, Amen.
[time=1785] In the 1985 US Open of Golf Dennis Watson had about a 20 foot putt to take the lead and win the first place prize.
[time=1801] It was a long breaking putt and he methodically locked his fingers and gripped around the putter.
[time=1807] He looked at the hole several times took several deliberate practice swings stood over the ball and stroked it.
[time=1815] The speed was perfect.
[time=1818] The line equally is precise.
[time=1822] The ball broke down the hill directly at the cup and then defied the laws of gravity and stopped.
[time=1830] With two thirds or three-fourths of the ball over the hole leaning it did not fall.
[time=1839] He could tap it in for a tie but if the ball would just fall he would win.
[time=1845] He walked over and he held onto his putter and he bent down to tap it in.
[time=1850] You could see the disbelief on his entire countenance.
[time=1853] It's got a fall.
[time=1855] He stood there for a few seconds and a few seconds and finally after 20 seconds of dismay he tapped it in.
[time=1863] Thinking that he had just tied for the lead and a marshal came over and assessed him with two stroke penalty.
[time=1870] For in golf you cannot deliberately wait over the ball for more than 10 seconds.
[time=1875] He was disqualified from the first place prize and it only cost him a mere $62,000 for that 22nd delay.
[time=1888] The book of Colossians gives us this warning.
[time=1891] Don't let anyone disqualify you from the prize.
[time=1897] If you have a Bible look at Colossians chapter 2 and verse 18.
[time=1902] We're studying through this book of the Bible and as you look at Colossians 2 it is a chapter of warnings.
[time=1909] In chapter 2 verse 8 it says see to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy.
[time=1916] The Bible is not anti-intellectual it doesn't say don't love wisdom but don't be sidetracked into the wisdom of man and miss the prize.
[time=1926] A warning against philosophy. Chapter 2 verse 16 says therefore do not let anyone judge you a warning about being religious.
[time=1936] Being religious is a dangerous thing.
[time=1939] For religion teaches you to do this and don't do that and if you follow these rules and you show up on the right days and you say the right things why then God will receive you.
[time=1949] And God could care less about your days and your lists and wants to know what we have done with his son Jesus Christ.
[time=1958] Now chapter 2 verse 18 says do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize.
[time=1973] Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.
[time=1986] He has lost connection with the head from whom the whole body supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows as God causes it to grow.
[time=2000] The central theme here is don't let anyone disqualify you from the prize.
[time=2012] 20 seconds.
[time=2015] $62,000 in a first place position.
[time=2020] Disqualified from the prize.
[time=2023] We've seen in our past two studies the warning about philosophy and then the warning about religion.
[time=2028] This one is a warning about mysticism.
[time=2032] It will become more clear of what mysticism is in a moment.
[time=2036] But this central phrase it's a command don't let anybody disqualify you.
[time=2041] It's very much of an athletic term of the individual who competes in the arena who enters the contest who succeeds and achieves but then is cast aside.
[time=2052] Disqualified.
[time=2055] In 1912 Jim Forp did what Northern man had ever done.
[time=2060] He had won in the Olympics both the decathlon and the pentathlon.
[time=2065] King Gustavus of Sweden declared him the greatest athlete in history.
[time=2071] He was awarded the prize only to be disqualified days later and be stripped of the gold medals
[time=2080] and prohibited from the games in the future.
[time=2085] It wasn't lack of ability.
[time=2088] It wasn't failure to perform.
[time=2091] It was failure to comply to the rules of the game.
[time=2096] This passage says don't let anyone disqualify you from the prize.
[time=2103] What is the prize?
[time=2106] Well, rather than me say what do you think it is?
[time=2109] Well, I agree.
[time=2110] Well, you know what I felt.
[time=2112] We often interpret scripture based upon emotion.
[time=2115] We need to interpret it based upon principle.
[time=2118] Here's a simple rule of biblical principle.
[time=2121] We interpret scripture out of context.
[time=2124] So we can't put a microscope here and only look at their phrase.
[time=2128] The prize and then subjectively decide we have to look at it with a telescope and see the whole picture.
[time=2135] The theme of Colossians is moving on to maturity.
[time=2141] Chapter 1 verse 9.
[time=2144] For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you
[time=2151] and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will.
[time=2155] What's the theme there?
[time=2157] Spiritual maturity.
[time=2159] Being filled with the knowledge that God has for you.
[time=2163] Chapter 1 verse 28.
[time=2165] We proclaim Him admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.
[time=2175] What is the theme?
[time=2177] Spiritual maturity moving on in our faith.
[time=2181] Chapter 2 verses 2 and 3.
[time=2185] My purpose is this, that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love so that they may have the full riches of the complete understanding.
[time=2197] In order that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ.
[time=2203] What's the theme?
[time=2205] Knowing the mystery, the depth of Christ.
[time=2209] Chapter 2 verse 6. So then just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him.
[time=2219] Rooted, built up, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, overflowing with thankfulness.
[time=2226] The theme of Colossians, the prize that is being set out there is this one.
[time=2231] God wants you to have the joy of spiritual maturity.
[time=2235] And you can come to Christ and the philosophers can get your mind derailed and you'll never grow to maturity by pursuing philosophy.
[time=2244] You can give your heart to Christ and be sidetracked by the religious people and you can get involved in religion and never move on to maturity in Christ.
[time=2253] You can become surrounded by a group of mystics and they will disqualify you because you're out of bounds in the race for spiritual maturity.
[time=2264] That is the prize.
[time=2266] This passage in no way is teaching that you can come to Christ.
[time=2270] If you get off the trail, God will reject you from His family and He'll take away your salvation.
[time=2276] That mansion that He builds for you and heaven, He puts a stop-work order on it, it's over.
[time=2282] That's not what it's saying at all.
[time=2284] Here's Jesus' promise.
[time=2286] Jesus said, "All that the Father has given unto me will come unto me and of them I shall lose none."
[time=2296] If you have come to Christ, He's got a hold of you and He won't let go.
[time=2301] I'm glad because His grip is a lot stronger than mine and I suspect yours.
[time=2307] This passage is not talking about losing salvation but losing the benefit of salvation which is moving on to maturity.
[time=2315] Those of you who are parents, you know how thrilling it is to see your kids grow and develop and mature.
[time=2322] My love in life is water sports, swimming, water skiing, boating, getting in the water, I love it.
[time=2332] One of my great joys is all of our kids know how to swim.
[time=2336] We go on the deep end, we go off the high dive, we go off the low dive and when we go to the pool I only have to watch one person.
[time=2343] That's Kathy. The kids are fine.
[time=2348] You know there's something exciting about being able to take your little guy and say,
[time=2354] "You want to go swimming and you don't go in the shallow insect. Now you want to blow some bubble?" That's not fun. That's not mature.
[time=2363] What's exciting is when you say that little guy, you want to go swim and he says, "Watch this dad." This little guy is so little and he walks up to this board and he climbs up there and he runs off.
[time=2374] There's no arm here and a leg there and a splat when he hits the water but up he bobs and takes him 50 strokes to get 5 feet but he makes it.
[time=2383] He says, "Oh, he's learning. He's growing, he's maturing." John the Apostle said this, "I have no greater joy than this that my children walk in the truth."
[time=2395] Do you want to please the Heavenly Father? He wants you to grow to maturity and he doesn't want any mystic, any religious person,
[time=2404] any philosopher to disqualify you so that you get bogged down in some unspiritual system and you miss the prize of spiritual maturity.
[time=2414] God wants us to grow beyond salvation to full maturity in Christ.
[time=2422] There is then this warning to watch out for the mystics.
[time=2428] What is a mystic? Allow this fourfold description that comes out of verses 18 and 19.
[time=2435] The description of the mystic number one, it says, "They delight in humility. If you're using a King James Bible, you will see that phrase, delight in humility."
[time=2445] You say, "Wait a minute. I thought humility was a virtue." Doesn't the Bible say God resists the proud but he gives grace to the humble?
[time=2455] Doesn't the Bible say humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and he will lift you up?
[time=2461] What about chronicles, 2 Chronicles 7, 14? "If my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves in prayer."
[time=2472] Doesn't God call us humility? Sure he does.
[time=2475] Allow this interpretive insight from the new international version and it is correct, I must say.
[time=2483] It's not somebody who delights in humility, it's somebody who delights in false humility.
[time=2492] I prefer the concept of staged behavior.
[time=2498] You've seen the commercial on television, it's a car repair shop and the greasy guy is standing there and he's just barking at this person and chewing this person out.
[time=2508] And the phone rings and he picks up and he goes, "Bonsure, completely staged behavior."
[time=2516] And many of us have the ability to stage our behavior.
[time=2521] And we know that humility is a virtue and so we have learned how to stage humility.
[time=2527] And if I can paraphrase this passage, we are not only humble but we're proud of it too.
[time=2534] A weekend seminar was held on principles of humility.
[time=2538] And at the end of the seminar, a vote was taken, an award was to be given to the candidate who demonstrated the greatest humility.
[time=2546] His name was denounced and he walked forward to receive the prize and they said you're disqualified.
[time=2552] You see, there's something intrinsic about humility that it is constant.
[time=2558] It is never staged, it is never temporary and it's never a point where we say, "I'm proud of my humility."
[time=2567] And these people were proud and they wanted you to know that they were humble and they were meek and they were wonderful.
[time=2575] And Paul said, "No." God says, "That's not it." And their false humility led them to a doctrinal error.
[time=2585] It says they delight not only false humility but in the worship of angels.
[time=2590] According to excellent historian William Barkley, these people believed that because they were sinful
[time=2598] and their false humility made them talk about how sinful they were, they said, "We're not worthy to pray to God so we have to pray to angels and the angels will carry the message up to God."
[time=2613] But the Bible is really clear on two points.
[time=2616] Point number one, we are not to worship angels.
[time=2619] When John the Apostle received God's inspiration to write the last book of the Bible Revelation,
[time=2627] it was given to him by dictation from an angel.
[time=2630] And John saw this angel and he started to bow down and worshiped and angel said, "Don't worship me.
[time=2635] I'm just a created being like you. Don't worship me." Second thing the Bible says is this, "You and I are sinful and we are not worthy to come before a righteous Holy God."
[time=2651] But it says there is one God and only one mediator between man and God, the man Christ Jesus.
[time=2660] He alone can intercede between us and God.
[time=2664] He alone can forgive our sins. He alone can carry our prayers and He alone can answer them.
[time=2671] You don't need an angel to represent you before God.
[time=2675] And if I can kindly be so blunt, you don't need a dead saint to represent you before God
[time=2681] and you don't need mother Mary to represent you before God, but you desperately need Jesus Christ
[time=2687] and He alone can forgive your sins. And these people were mystical because they wanted to worship
[time=2696] all of these angels and spirit beings because I'm too humble to go before the living God.
[time=2704] That's the first description of the mystics. They delighted in false humility.
[time=2709] The second one is this, they were hung up on visions. Now I know that's not very theological to say hung up,
[time=2718] but they were hung up on visions. These people believe if you really want to get to know God,
[time=2724] what you really need to do is you need to pray that God gives you a special vision
[time=2730] and then you'll really have a deep, rich, mystical experience.
[time=2736] And I tell you, there isn't anything spiritual about that at all.
[time=2740] Long before Christ came to this earth, long before He died for our sins,
[time=2746] long before these Colossians ever heard from the Apostle Paul or Apaphras, they were into mystery revelations. The Greeks had what they called mystery religions
[time=2758] like the Ellucinian mystery, where you could only join the religion
[time=2764] after you went through the ceremony of beholding.
[time=2768] And if the ceremony of beholding, if you saw the vision, then you could enter the right.
[time=2773] But if you didn't see the vision, you were out.
[time=2777] And so you would be taken in the city of Delphi into a cave for the ceremony of beholding,
[time=2783] and everyone would sit there, and they would wait, and they would wait, and they would wait for the vision to come.
[time=2789] Somebody would gasp. Another person would say, "I saw it!" The person next to him would go, "You saw it?" "Why?" "Yes, I did. Didn't use it." "Oh, if you saw it, I saw it." "What did it look like?" "Well, you know we're not allowed to talk about it." "Oh, that's right. I saw it." And everybody said, "I saw it!"
[time=2808] They were in divisions 400 years before the Gospel, and all they were doing was when they were taking their past Greek background and trying to stick it into the Bible and say, "Boy, if you want maturity, what do you need are visions."
[time=2823] You don't need visions.
[time=2825] I want to tell you, you can have a vision if you're from the Elucinian call, and you can have a vision if you have too much pepperoni on your pizza at midnight.
[time=2834] There are any number of sources of visions, and they are not all spiritual.
[time=2843] The Bible tells us some keen insight about visions.
[time=2848] Turn to first, excuse me, second Peter chapter one.
[time=2853] And here's a man who had visions.
[time=2856] Probably the two most significant visions in the Bible were received by Peter.
[time=2862] The first is he was included on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[time=2866] You want to talk about a vision. How would you like to be standing there and say, "This is a beautiful mountain." We had to open up a resort motel up here.
[time=2872] All of a sudden Jesus transforms from his earthly body to his heavenly body, and then there's two other guys there, Moses and Elijah, who have been dead for a thousand years.
[time=2880] I mean, that would get your attention. That's a vision. Peter saw it.
[time=2886] Peter also was the one who God gave a vision of a sheet coming down with all the unclean animals, and it said, "Take up and eat." Peter said, "I can't eat that. It's unclean." God said, "Peter, don't you ever call what I call clean, unclean again."
[time=2900] And that was his commission to preach the gospel of the Gentiles.
[time=2903] Now here's a man who has had visions.
[time=2906] Here's what he says, 2 Peter 1-3.
[time=2911] "His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of him."
[time=2920] How can it be more clear than to say, "You've been given Christ.
[time=2925] That's all that you need for life and godliness.
[time=2928] You don't need a mystical experience if you have Christ.
[time=2933] You have all that you need." Then in verses 12 and following, he refers back to the event of the transfiguration,
[time=2946] and he says this in verse 17, "For he received honor and glory from God the Father, meaning Christ.
[time=2952] When the voice came down to him from majestic glory saying, 'This is my son whom I loved with him.
[time=2961] I am well pleased.'" That's the transfiguration.
[time=2965] Peter says, "We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven, and when we were with him on the sacred mountain."
[time=2972] Now he brings up his vision. Now look at verse 19.
[time=2975] "And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it as a light that shines in a dark place."
[time=2986] What is the word of the prophets made more certain?
[time=2991] Verse 19 tells us of that word, verse 20 gives definition.
[time=2998] Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came by the prophets' own interpretation.
[time=3005] For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
[time=3014] You know what he's saying? He's saying, "I've had a vision. I've been on the amount of transfiguration.
[time=3020] You want something that's made more sure than the inspired word of God.
[time=3025] If you want to press on to maturity, you don't need a vision. You need time in God's word.
[time=3031] It is not unusual for someone to call me and say, "I have had a vision."
[time=3038] I must admit to you, I greet that with guarded skepticism at best, and I inquire, tell me about it.
[time=3046] One dear friend said, "Well, God came to me, and he told me that if I didn't do this,
[time=3053] that I would be eternally damned." I said, "Can I ask you a question? Have you received Jesus Christ as your Savior?" She said, "Yes, I have." I said, "Thank you. I can put you at complete rest. You did not have a vision of God."
[time=3069] She said, "Of course I did. It was God, and he told me that if I didn't do this, I'd be eternally damned."
[time=3075] And I said, "No, it wasn't God." She said, "How can you say that?" I said, "Because God is never going to give somebody a vision and say something that contradicts what he's already promised in his word."
[time=3086] And God said, "If you give your life to Jesus Christ, he will forgive you of all sins, and he's never going to re-nig on that promise."
[time=3093] And I said, "But you, if you don't do this detail, not from God."
[time=3099] She said, "Where could it be?" I was hoping she would ask.
[time=3104] There are two other explanations.
[time=3107] Explanation number one, it's the deception of demons.
[time=3110] And most of you know me well enough that I do not look under every plant for a demon.
[time=3117] But I believe they are real.
[time=3120] And 2 Corinthians chapter 11 tells us that Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light,
[time=3129] which simply says, Satan takes his evil message.
[time=3133] He packages it to make it look like a good message because that's how it sells in the retail world of religious experience.
[time=3140] And it could be a satanic deception or it could be a self-deception.
[time=3147] You see, it's very simple psychologically.
[time=3150] If you believe something can happen, if you believe something can happen and you have the power to make it happen
[time=3160] and you want it to happen, it will happen.
[time=3164] So if you believe visions are possible, your mind has the ability to create them.
[time=3170] And if you want them, they're going to happen and it's all from you.
[time=3175] And the same thing is true with other experiences like psychosomatic healings and speaking in tongues.
[time=3185] You believe it can happen, you have the physical ability to make those sounds, you want it to happen, it will happen.
[time=3193] We have that human ability and then we can be self-deceived and say, God gave me this vision, God gave me this experience.
[time=3202] I don't think God gave it to you.
[time=3207] The Bible is really clear here that what you don't need are visions of your own or of anyone else's.
[time=3219] The third description of the mystics is this one.
[time=3222] They are inflated with themselves.
[time=3226] They're puffed up, their ego is on overdrive and they are announcing, you wouldn't believe what I experienced.
[time=3235] Wait till you hear what the Lord told me.
[time=3237] The Lord said to me, can I caution you as sincere believers in Christ to be very careful of phrases like the Lord told me?
[time=3246] What do you mean the Lord told me?
[time=3250] I believe the Lord tells me things.
[time=3253] Can I tell you how he tells me?
[time=3255] He tells me through his word as I study it and his spirit applies it to my life.
[time=3262] One dear friend said, I was doing this and I was doing that and then the Lord told me, I'm late.
[time=3270] I think the Lord told you, you're late.
[time=3274] I don't understand that because you don't have to be a Christian to remember something.
[time=3279] You know, we all have a memory.
[time=3281] It's kind of standard equipment.
[time=3283] Now your kids can give you this blank, mindless look, but there is a memory behind it.
[time=3291] Do not have to have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to remember, I've got an appointment at four o'clock.
[time=3298] Now it's nice that somebody wants to give the Lord credit for everything, but we're slacking off back into this false humility.
[time=3305] And what we're trying to do is we're trying to appear spiritual.
[time=3310] The desperate need of a watching world is for genuine Christianity, not some hyped up, souped up language.
[time=3319] The fourth description is this one.
[time=3321] It is extremely blunt, but it is God and not mine.
[time=3325] They are detached from Christ.
[time=3328] It says this in verse 19.
[time=3331] He has lost connection with the head.
[time=3336] Now let me get into some application and this next little section, this is mine.
[time=3341] If you don't like it, you can say I don't like that because it's not God's.
[time=3345] Where does this interest in the mystical come from?
[time=3349] It comes from three sources. Source number one is our temperament.
[time=3353] We have a predisposed temperament in certain directions.
[time=3357] For example, some of you are just going to love our new sanctuary.
[time=3361] It is not a gym. There are no baskets to hang from the ceiling.
[time=3364] There are no stripes on the floor.
[time=3366] It's going to have a huge organ that can sound more like a pipe organ than a pike organ.
[time=3371] It will rattle the stained glass window. It will rattle your dentures.
[time=3375] You'll just love it.
[time=3377] And some of you will say now this church is finally getting down to worship.
[time=3383] But that's their temperament.
[time=3385] If they weren't Christians, they would be at the embassy listening to some secular organ recital and ooing and awning over it.
[time=3392] That's just their temperament.
[time=3394] There are others who, their only temperament is, they've got to have the lights down real low, they've got to have a guitar in their hand.
[time=3401] And you never notice you can't play a guitar with your eyes open.
[time=3403] It's one of those physiological phenomenons.
[time=3407] And their message is mellow, and now we're finally down to worship.
[time=3411] That guy, if he wasn't a Christian, he wouldn't have been at the embassy listening to the pipe organ. He'd have been at the Coliseum listening to John Denver.
[time=3419] And you say, "Well, I'm not like that, and I'm not like that." No, there are those who are over here, and they are very, very, very straight.
[time=3431] These people are very, very loose, and the rest of us are in the middle.
[time=3435] We were born in the middle, we live in the middle, we will die in the middle.
[time=3439] Johnny Cash put it this way.
[time=3441] Well, the one on the right was on the left, the one on the left was on the right, and the one in the middle was a Baptist.
[time=3449] And we're downright proud that we're not at either extreme.
[time=3452] And that's just our temperament.
[time=3454] It's not the spirit, it's us.
[time=3458] And we've got to get people.
[time=3460] Have you made your decision for Christ yet?
[time=3483] Have you opened up your heart and asked Him to come in?
[time=3487] I'd like to lead you in a simple prayer right now, so that you could do that.
[time=3493] Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3498] And I ask you to come into my heart, and to forgive me of my sins.
[time=3503] I want to follow you as my Lord, and live with you forever in Heaven.
[time=3509] Thank you for the free gift of eternal life, amen.
[time=3514] If you have prayed to receive Christ as Savior, we are delighted that you have made your decision for Christ.
[time=3521] And we'd like to send you a helpful booklet to help you to grow in your Christian walk entitled "Your Decision." To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Strange Cults in America," please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
