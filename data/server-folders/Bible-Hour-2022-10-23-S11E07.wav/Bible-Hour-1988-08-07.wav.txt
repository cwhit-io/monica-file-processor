[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=113] Charles Hatton Spurgeon is without a doubt one of the greatest preachers of all time.
[time=119] Huge auditoriums were built in London just so the crowds could come and hear this dynamic
[time=125] perclaimer of God's word.
[time=128] But much to the surprise of some of his American guests, they learned that Spurgeon smoked
[time=134] large cigars.
[time=137] One time he was confronted about the spirituality of smoking such cigars, and Spurgeon reported that as long as I don't do it in excess, there isn't anything wrong with my cigars.
[time=149] The inquirer said, "Well, Mr. Spurgeon, what do you consider excess?
[time=152] You smoke several cigars a day." Spurgeon without hesitation said, "Access, my friend, is when I smoke two of them at the same time."
[time=175] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=179] Thank you for joining us.
[time=180] Rick is continuing his series from the Book of Colossians with a message he has entitled "The Pit Falls of Legalism." Some teach that obeying a list of man-made rules is the source of true spiritual life.
[time=192] Rules such as don't drink, don't smoke, don't wear long hair, and don't wear makeup.
[time=198] While each of these rules may have some value in a particular culture, they can't do nothing to ensure true spirituality.
[time=205] The Colossians chapter 2 is the basis for our study today as we search the scripture for insight on this important and often controversial issue.
[time=213] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=217] We'll be looking at verses 20 through 22.
[time=221] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=226] Other special music includes a solo from Chris Bone.
[time=232] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=239] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=244] Now here's Rick.
[time=245] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television and welcome them to the Bible Hour.
[time=251] This morning, we want to magnify the name of Jesus Christ and say, "All hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall." Those are great hymns of the faith that speak of that, O 4,000 tongues to sing, my great redeemer's praise.
[time=265] The hymn gives us the focus on Jesus Christ.
[time=268] I hope you'll enjoy our choir and orchestra as they lead us in a majestic hymn of praise.
[time=289] Oh, hail the power of Jesus' name, let angels prostrate fall.
[time=298] Bring forth the royal diagon, and crown it, Lord, our almighty, bring forth the royal
[time=313] diagon, and crown it, Lord, our Lord.
[time=323] We chose and sing our Israel's great hymns and from the fall.
[time=332] Hail him, who say to by his grace, and crown it, Lord, our home.
[time=356] Oh, that we have no secret from we, and his feet may fall.
[time=366] We'll join the everlasting sun, and crown it, Lord, our home.
[time=390] Crown it, crown it, crown it, crown it, and crown it, Lord, our home.
[time=411] Oh, hail.
[time=425] Let's continue our singing by turning to number 32.
[time=428] Him number 32, I sing the mighty power of God.
[time=438] I sing the mighty power of God, let me go after God, and spread the glory to the front,
[time=458] and give the glory's heart, I sing the rich of men who may come soon through the day.
[time=472] The moon shines for when things come in, and all the stars are away.
[time=483] I sing the rich of men, send the glory, and give the glory to the rich of men who may come soon through the day.
[time=512] With eyes of angel, friend, and friend, for it's a bright, bright.
[time=523] There's not a blend for the ring of the gates of orator.
[time=533] And clouds are ours, and timbers flop, by over, from my throne.
[time=543] I'll all get our own side from me, it's ever in my care.
[time=552] And everywhere, ever in me, come, come, come, come, come, come soon.
[time=567] Thank you for that fine singing this morning.
[time=569] Our special music this morning is provided by Chris Bone.
[time=573] Chris Husband Bruce runs the sound for us here at Church.
[time=576] Chris, Lord bless you as your minister this morning.
[time=582] You came along just at the right time When I was at the end of the day.
[time=609] When I was at the end of my life I filled my empty heart with love.
[time=620] When I thought I had no heart at all You showed me what my life could be.
[time=629] When I heard You called to me And You came along just at the right time.
[time=642] When the peace was hard to find You filled my empty life with hope.
[time=654] When my life was full of fears, I gave my life a reason and I gave it all to my team.
[time=668] And every now and then, when I feel lost I remember how You touched my life.
[time=683] And when I want to hear You won't forget You are amazing.
[time=698] Just at the right time.
[time=714] You came along just at the right time When I was at the end of my life.
[time=730] I filled my empty heart with love.
[time=734] When I thought I had no heart at all You showed me what my life could be.
[time=742] When I heard You called to me And every now and then, when I feel lost
[time=756] I remember how You touched my life And when I need to feel Your touch again.
[time=771] You were always there Just at the right time.
[time=786] Just at the right time.
[time=808] It is such a privilege for us to have the opportunity of sharing our morning worship services with each of you by way of television.
[time=816] So let me begin by thanking you for setting this hour aside that we could share God's Word together.
[time=822] From these next few moments we are taking a break from the live part of our morning worship service and pre-recording a few moments so we can talk directly with you our television family.
[time=833] First of all I want to encourage you during this time of the year to register to vote in the fall elections.
[time=840] I hope that most of you are already registered but many of you are not.
[time=844] I just know that because statistically so many Americans are not registered to vote.
[time=851] I was shocked and surprised to learn on last night's news that of all of the democratic
[time=857] nations in the world where free elections are held the United States of America ranks
[time=863] dead last in the percentage of people who actually vote.
[time=868] Many of them do not vote because they cannot because they have failed to register.
[time=873] If you have not voted in recent elections or if you have moved or have had a change of address for any reason you must re-register to vote.
[time=883] And this fall we are electing president, senator, congressman, state and local officials and
[time=890] it is important as Christians that we exercise our right and our responsibility to vote.
[time=897] So if you are not registered to vote let me encourage you to contact either the courthouse in the county in which you live or the board of elections in the county in which you live and they will give you simple specific instructions as how you can register to vote.
[time=913] I hope that none of you will let this election come and pass without registering to vote.
[time=920] And it is important that you act quickly because the deadline is months before the election.
[time=925] You cannot register one day and vote the next.
[time=928] You will need to register during August and September.
[time=931] So please tomorrow on Monday morning as you arise make that a priority on your to-do list
[time=938] to register to vote.
[time=941] Well coming up in the life of our church are some of the most exciting days as we look forward to the opening of our new sanctuary and our new home for the Bible hour.
[time=951] I hope you will take out your calendar and record these dates.
[time=956] They are October 14th, 15th and 16th.
[time=960] That is our dedication weekend and we have a list of special guests who are coming to minister to us and challenge us to use this new facility for the glory of God and to reach
[time=971] people for Christ.
[time=973] On Friday October the 14th we will begin with a concert with keyboard artist Nielsen and Young.
[time=979] Then on October the 15th Saturday night our former pastor and founder David Jeremiah will be here.
[time=985] And then on Sunday October the 16th Pastor David Burnham who was the man that led me to
[time=991] Christ will be here.
[time=993] And he will be freshly back from the Olympics where he has spent a month of September ministering
[time=999] through an international sports coalition to the athletes who are participating in the Olympic Games.
[time=1005] So save those dates of October 14th, 15th and 16th.
[time=1010] Finally, let me encourage you to deal with a spiritual problem that most of us battle
[time=1016] to some degree, great or small.
[time=1019] It is a deep matter called bitterness.
[time=1023] Hebrews tells us see to it that no root of bitterness springs up in you and by yet many
[time=1029] are defiled.
[time=1031] Bitterness can set in our hearts and cause our hearts to be paralyzed, to have our spirits
[time=1039] and countenance poisoned with its anger and its unforgiving spirit.
[time=1044] Each of us will battle from time to time with bitterness.
[time=1048] And here Jim Henry describes how God would have us to deal with this problem.
[time=1053] We'd love to send you this booklet entitled Bitterness if you will simply write and ask for it today.
[time=1059] Our address is the Bible Hour 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1070] Once again write to us at the Bible Hour 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1080] 46815.
[time=1081] Be sure and ask for the booklet on bitterness and we'll send you your copy that's in stock
[time=1088] right away.
[time=1089] Thank you again for joining us here today on the Bible Hour and we're looking forward to studying God's word together in these next moments that are ours.
[time=1118] I've made to love you from the moment I opened my eyes from the first step till that last
[time=1133] step, all of my life, with little hands to serve you, little boys to praise, growing
[time=1150] up in you Lord, all of my days I was born to love you, it's all so plain to see, born
[time=1169] to love you as you were born for me, and as the days pass by me they draw me close to
[time=1189] you, my wrinkles are the lessons, where you've taught me truth I was born to love you, it's
[time=1205] all so plain to see, born to love you as you were born for me, time only draws me closer
[time=1225] to you, as I grow older and wiser, each passing moment I walk in your truth, my love for you
[time=1238] is my greatest desire, I was born to love you, it's all so plain to see, born to love
[time=1254] you as you were born for me, it's all so plain to see, born to love you as you were born
[time=1284] for me
[time=1297] Thank you Chris, may I invite you to pray with me now, God I am thankful for the reminder
[time=1304] of a song that my purpose in life, my origin, my occasion for birth is to know you and
[time=1314] to love you, and Father is so many of us search desperately to find purpose and fulfillment
[time=1321] in life, may they hear that song today, and may their eyes be opened and their hearts
[time=1329] receive Jesus Christ, our purpose for living, we pray that this morning in this worship
[time=1335] service that the name of Christ would be exalted and magnified above every name, we pray that
[time=1342] you would be pleased with the things that we do and the words that we speak and the thoughts and the emotions that we hold within our being, oh God we want to honor you, we
[time=1354] want you to be satisfied with our worship, and we know that can only come if you give
[time=1360] us your spirit, and so we ask you today to cleanse us, we confess our sinfulness, to
[time=1368] restore us and to make us clean so that you can receive our worship today, separate from
[time=1376] us all falsehood and pretense and hypocrisy, give us a hovey dose of honesty, make us to
[time=1384] walk in integrity, not just for a worship service, but for a week, for a lifetime, God
[time=1392] make of us new people, we pray today that your word would refresh us, like the athlete desperately
[time=1401] looking for its second wind, may we today find new energy from you, we pray that you
[time=1408] would encourage new believers who have given their heart to Christ, that they'll become rooted and strengthened and move on to maturity, we pray for believers who have walked with you for the years that they'll not grow weary, but with freshness, with vigor and vitality,
[time=1423] they'll hunger to serve you today, we pray for those who are troubled, some who have
[time=1430] been mistreated and maligned, that they'll find in you a refuge today, we pray for those
[time=1437] who have been the villains, that you'll give to them a heart of repentance, we pray for
[time=1443] the victims, that you'll keep them from bitterness, and we pray for the two to be restored.
[time=1451] And now as we open up your word, we open up our hearts, we ask you to teach us, I plead
[time=1457] with you, Lord, to guard my tongue, that it would always and only honor you, and I ask
[time=1463] you to do the same for these dear people's ears, that they might hear your word and not me in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1474] Years ago I heard a story that caused me to chuckle and laugh, and then I heard it again
[time=1481] on Charles Swindall's insight for living not too long ago, it's one that I would like to open today's message with for you.
[time=1490] The story is about Charles Haddon Spurgeon, who was without a doubt one of the greatest creatures of all time, his mind was insightful, his heart filled with the scriptures, and
[time=1502] his voice eloquent and magnificent above all others.
[time=1506] In fact Spurgeon's voice was so great, that when an architect wanted his building to be
[time=1512] tested for acoustics, he asked Spurgeon to come and use his voice in the building.
[time=1518] Spurgeon walked into the auditorium that was still under construction, and he said, "Behold,
[time=1525] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world," there was so much quality and residence in his voice that it made every year listen, and a man working on the building, a top of the scaffolding came down and accepted Christ as a savior.
[time=1540] That was the voice and the intensity that Spurgeon had.
[time=1544] He was an Englishman, and the social traditions there and here were quite different, and one
[time=1550] American was quite shocked to learn that the great Spurgeon had the daily habit of smoking several long black stoggy cigars.
[time=1561] Spurgeon was confronted by the bemiffed American, and was asked how he could measure his spirituality
[time=1567] with such behavior.
[time=1570] Spurgeon responded that there wasn't any problem with his smoking cigars as long as he didn't do it in excess.
[time=1576] The man said, "Will you smoke several days?
[time=1579] What do you consider excess?" And Spurgeon says, "Excess, my friend, is when you smoke two cigars at the same time."
[time=1587] All that for this morning opens Pandora's box to the whole area of what is spiritual
[time=1594] and what is not spiritual.
[time=1596] If you have your Bible, please turn to Colossians chapter 2.
[time=1601] Rossions is Paul's pleading with us by inspiration of God to move on to maturity, to get rooted
[time=1609] down deep into God's word that we might grow up strong and tall, to be spiritual giants.
[time=1616] This church and all others like it runs the danger of being inhabited by spiritual pygmies.
[time=1623] Little Christians with no depth, inability to reach tall for Christ.
[time=1630] Don't misunderstand, I have a personal fondness of short people.
[time=1635] But spiritually God wants us to tower.
[time=1638] Colossians 2 warns us that spiritual maturity, first of all, cannot come through philosophy.
[time=1645] It's good to love wisdom, it's good to study the classics, but spiritual maturity does not come through philosophy, it comes through Christ.
[time=1653] Then he warns us that spiritual maturity does not come through religion, it doesn't come through observances of special days, of festivals, of feast, of ceremony, it doesn't come through
[time=1664] church attendance, it doesn't come through giving to the offering.
[time=1668] Spiritual maturity does not come through religion, it comes through Christ.
[time=1673] Then he warns us that spiritual maturity does not come through deep, mystical experiences that nobody else has had.
[time=1682] Spiritual maturity comes through Christ.
[time=1684] Now at the end of Colossians 2 he warns us that spiritual maturity does not come through
[time=1690] legalism, it comes through Christ.
[time=1694] Colossians chapter 2 verse 20, "Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of
[time=1703] this world, why, as though you still belong to it, do you submit to its rules?
[time=1710] Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch."
[time=1717] These are all destined to perish with the use because they are based on human commands
[time=1723] and teachings.
[time=1725] Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship,
[time=1734] their false humility, and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining
[time=1742] sexual indulgence.
[time=1746] I have labeled these verses Paul's warning against legalism.
[time=1751] For you I call the message pitfalls, little traps within legalism.
[time=1758] I'll divide the day's message down into four parts.
[time=1761] Paul's instruction.
[time=1763] It begins in verse 20 with this bold statement, "Since you died with Christ to the basic principles
[time=1771] of this world, why, as though you still belong to it, do you submit to its rules?"
[time=1778] He is reasoning all the way back to the previous verses where he said Christ took the law,
[time=1785] he died for it and he nailed it to the cross, he made a public spectacle, he said the law is dead, it is over with you and I are no longer under the law.
[time=1795] So why do you submit when somebody says you need to worship on the Sabbath?
[time=1800] You need to sacrifice on the right days.
[time=1802] He says it's dead, it is over, it has no more power over us.
[time=1808] So why do you submit to it?
[time=1812] His reasoning is against a system of spiritual maturity that falsely believes that it can
[time=1819] be arrived at through obeying rules.
[time=1822] Let me give you Hox's definition of legalism, so if you don't like it you can pitch this, this isn't God's, but it's one that I'll attempt to give you to help us to understand the passage.
[time=1832] The theme of Colossians is maturity in Christ, legalism is the misconception that spiritual
[time=1840] maturity is attained by strict adherence to a list of man-made rules.
[time=1848] Can I run that by you a second time?
[time=1851] Legalism is the misconception that spiritual maturity is attained by strict adherence to
[time=1858] a list of man-made rules.
[time=1860] Now within that definition let me make two important points of distinction.
[time=1865] Point number one is we're talking about man-made rules, not God-ordained rules.
[time=1873] God has said your body is not for immorality, that is not legalistic for me to say that,
[time=1879] for you to believe it, for anyone to teach it, that is God's rules.
[time=1886] We're talking about man-made rules, things that deal with hair length, or what kind of
[time=1892] clothing you wear, those are man-made rules.
[time=1896] The second distinction is that these rules are being used to measure spirituality.
[time=1903] You're going to have all the rules you want about anything you want, and you're not a legalist unless you use the rules to somehow measure our produced spirituality.
[time=1913] I'm going to come back to that theme again and again today.
[time=1917] That legalism consists of man-made rules, not God's, that are used to measure spirituality.
[time=1926] That's what we are being warned against here.
[time=1929] Paul's whole instruction is this.
[time=1932] It is using what we call a logical lead-in, sent your dead to the law.
[time=1941] Why do you obey it?
[time=1945] The point is it is over, legalism is done, it's been buried.
[time=1951] Move on to maturity.
[time=1954] Secondly, he gives us some illustrations, three of them.
[time=1958] He says, why do you submit to its rules, rules like don't handle, don't taste, don't even
[time=1966] touch.
[time=1968] We cannot say with definitive conviction what it is he's referring to.
[time=1973] What did he mean when he said don't handle?
[time=1976] The word handle means more than a casual touch, it means the grip, the touch, the feeling over it, to check it out, please don't squeeze the Charmons.
[time=1984] It's not that you just touch them, you're really squeezing them.
[time=1987] That's the word handle there, don't know handle, what did he mean don't handle?
[time=1991] Some would say, well, the Old Testament says you're not allowed to touch an unclean animal, so he meant don't get legalistic about what animals you can touch.
[time=1998] The Old Testament taught you couldn't touch your dead body or you were defiled.
[time=2002] He was talking about that.
[time=2004] We don't know what he meant by that.
[time=2007] Then he said don't taste.
[time=2009] He probably was referring to those legalists who said you're still under the law and you can't eat bacon because that comes from a pig and a pig's an unclean animal and you're defiled if you do it, so don't.
[time=2021] But he may have met meat-offered idols, roast beef, perfectly kosher, legal stuff in the
[time=2028] Old Testament, but offered by this pig and butcher to that pig and god and then sold at a discount, maybe they're saying don't eat that meat-offered idols.
[time=2038] Maybe he's talking about anything that has alcohol in it when he says don't taste, maybe he meant that you know you people live over there in Asia and you've got all these fine wines and don't taste, could be.
[time=2051] Then he says don't touch.
[time=2054] That's an extreme point, don't even handle it, don't taste it, don't even touch it.
[time=2059] Total abstinence, total separation.
[time=2062] I think the point of what Paul's saying here is not to get bogged down in one of these three illustrations is he arguing, he's arguing it's the whole system that's built on one phrase do not.
[time=2074] You see how intrinsically negative this approach to spiritual life is?
[time=2079] It's measuring spirituality not on what we do do with our life for Christ but on what
[time=2085] we don't do and we miss the whole point.
[time=2089] You see we can spend our life not doing anything wrong and still do nothing right.
[time=2095] Did you ever stop and think about that?
[time=2098] You can spend your whole life doing nothing wrong and end up having done nothing right.
[time=2105] Jesus told us about the parable of the talents, the talent and the unit of money were given to three different men.
[time=2111] One man took it and hid it in the ground.
[time=2115] He did nothing right with it.
[time=2117] That was his point of condemnation.
[time=2119] He did nothing right with what he had.
[time=2123] Let me give you some historic illustrations.
[time=2126] Even as early as days of Paul men were trying to separate themselves from the world because
[time=2132] they didn't want to get defiled and they began to form what were called ascetic groups
[time=2139] and ascetic is somebody who withdraws from society.
[time=2143] They form little cloisters, little monasteries were only the adherence to this strict code
[time=2149] were allowed in and they judged you by how hard the bed was on which you slept.
[time=2154] All you slept on a mattress, you spiritual, softy you, I slept on the hard oak plank floor.
[time=2162] I'm more spiritual, oh boy you are spiritual.
[time=2165] That's serious.
[time=2166] They did that but that wasn't enough.
[time=2169] Some people thought they weren't separated enough from the world and they became stylites.
[time=2174] Now, a stylite isn't somebody who's styled in their clothing.
[time=2177] A stylite is somebody who lived on top of a pole and people actually did this.
[time=2183] They would put a pole in the ground.
[time=2185] They'd usually go up anywhere from 20 to 40 feet in the air.
[time=2189] On top of the pole they would build a platform about 8 foot by 8 foot and they would live up there.
[time=2194] They had a rope and a bucket and they would lower it down.
[time=2197] Their disciples would put food in and say, oh he's spiritual up there on his pole.
[time=2201] I wonder how he's doing.
[time=2202] He'd pull it back up.
[time=2203] He'd live up there.
[time=2206] That's how legalistic they became.
[time=2208] They didn't want to taste.
[time=2210] They didn't want to touch, they didn't want to handle and they measured spirituality on a whole system of don'ts.
[time=2220] Let me back up and make a couple points again that I'll make again.
[time=2226] It's legalism when it is a man-made rule used to measure spirituality.
[time=2235] Rules are fine.
[time=2237] Of all the rules you want, just distinguish that this one is God's and this one is man's.
[time=2244] This one is spiritual.
[time=2246] This one's purely organizational and there's not one thing wrong with having an organizational rule.
[time=2251] Do you know if you work at McDonald's you may only work in Ronald McDonald approved clothing.
[time=2259] You can't show up and say, hey boss what do you think of my new denim jeans and this wild sweatshirt I got he'll say, it's great stuff.
[time=2265] I'll put on your Ronald McDonald uniform and go to work.
[time=2269] Do you know that you can't work for Mickey Mouse and smoke cigarettes on the job?
[time=2276] Can't do it and neither Ronald McDonald or Mickey Mouse are trying to say the reason
[time=2282] for these rules is it produces spiritual maturity.
[time=2285] They say, no this is the image we want to have for our business, for our company.
[time=2291] You know you can't work at UPS and show up any time you like for work because they run the tightest ship and the shipping business and you got to be there on time.
[time=2300] They're not doing that because we think it's spiritual that our trucks leave all at eight o'clock.
[time=2305] Now it's organizational and so a church can have an organizational rule that says if you
[time=2312] want to teach in this church and make up a rule you can never go to the theater.
[time=2316] That's fine if a church wants to make that rule just never say because spiritual people never go to the theater.
[time=2325] I went to the Talbot seminary.
[time=2327] There was a rule there that you could not go to the theater for any movie of any kind.
[time=2333] Then the hiding place came out and it didn't go to churches.
[time=2337] It went to the secular theater and the powers that be got together and they decided well we could go to the theater to see the hiding place.
[time=2344] I remember Avery in the back of Dr. Thomas's class right after the announcement raised his hand and he said, "Dr. Thomas about this rule you know no movies and now we can go.
[time=2355] What I want to know is did the Lord change his mind or have you boys been lying to us all this time?" You see the movie rules fine.
[time=2367] Just say this is organizational it isn't spiritual.
[time=2371] Church can have that rule.
[time=2372] A Christian school or college can say at our school we have a uniform and there isn't
[time=2380] anything spiritual about wearing drab colors it's just organizational.
[time=2384] We choose to have it.
[time=2385] It's fine as long as you say it's not God's it's not spiritual it's ours.
[time=2390] Mom and Dad it's fine to say in our house everybody's home by ten o'clock.
[time=2396] Don't tell them because in the book of Lamentations chapter 4 verse 19 the God said yay by ten o'clock all sins start yeah don't blame that on God.
[time=2405] Just say that's our rule.
[time=2408] We had a rule at the Hawks family when I was growing up you came home when the street lights came on and I learned to swim and run fast because the street lights came on and I was
[time=2418] a long way from home.
[time=2420] Wasn't anything spiritual about it was organizational.
[time=2425] That's what my dad said and the only verse in our family I understood is the soul that sins it shall die and I ran home it was organizational not spiritual mom and dads have
[time=2437] every right to make all the rules they want mom and dad just tell them which are yours and which are gods and it's fair.
[time=2447] Allow this passing word to preachers principles and parents first tell them that the rules
[time=2455] organizational and not spiritual secondly tell them that it's yours and it's not gods and
[time=2465] then make all the rules that you want you're not guilty of legalism not in the least.
[time=2474] Third thing the Paul does he gives us the instruction then the illustrations then he tells us the inadequacies of legalism three of them he tells us why he's against legal
[time=2485] ism because it's absolutely totally and categorically inadequate for three reasons.
[time=2490] First of all legalism is a perishing system verse 22 all these things are destined to
[time=2496] perish with the use now great theological debate what's perishing is that these objects
[time=2502] the food the wine the sex that's perishing or is it the rules over here that talk about the food the wine and the sex could be either one I believe it's actually the rules.
[time=2515] You see we make up rules that aren't God's rules and then the circumstances change and
[time=2523] the whole church is looking at us saying now did you lie to us or did God or what's the deal.
[time=2528] Let me give you some illustrations do you know that used to be said in pulpits of America
[time=2534] that the automobile is the work of the devil God didn't make the human body to travel
[time=2542] at speeds like thirty five miles an hour the human body cannot withstand it now most
[time=2549] of us desperately try to keep it somewhere under sixty five but we used to say those
[time=2555] things used to be said in American pulpit pulpits that if God intended for man to fly
[time=2561] he would have given him wings but he reserved those for the angels and the birds of the air who's against flying you know when I was in high school in 1968 the issue of spirituality
[time=2575] was hair length and there's hardly a man in this auditorium today whose hair length
[time=2581] would have been appropriate by spiritual standards if your hair came anywhere close to your ears it was sinful I mean everybody believed in white wall tires not on your car around your
[time=2593] ears you know if you didn't have a nice white band you were sinful that was spirituality
[time=2600] in 1968 it's now 1988 and moms and dads are no longer saying get your haircut kids are
[time=2608] coming home with their heads shaved and these little cuts and the parents were saying oh honey wouldn't you like to let your hair grow the whole point is this every man made rule
[time=2620] is going to perish and every god made ordained rule is going to last forever and legalism
[time=2630] is an inadequate system because it's a parishing system third secondly I can't count secondly
[time=2636] legalism is an inadequate system because it is a pretentious system notice the next phrase
[time=2645] such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom not that they are wise but they
[time=2653] appear to be wise have you ever been around a legalistic person who can justify to you why they don't play shuffleboard I mean they've got this verse compared with that verse and
[time=2664] they put it together and you lock it together and you go wow that's deep and it appears
[time=2670] to be wise and it's not wise it just has that appearance and it's actually pretentious
[time=2677] because it is self-imposed worship and it is false humility and harsh treatment of the
[time=2684] body it's a pretentious system it's a system that is done for the show and the show looks
[time=2692] good if you're arguing with a legalist quit he or she will win because they can give you
[time=2699] a verse that implies this that implies that and they apply it this way and you go right
[time=2705] it's so wise and it's not it just appears to be so thirdly legalism is an inadequate
[time=2715] system because it is a powerless system look at verse 23 the final phrase but they lack
[time=2724] any value in restraining sexual indulgence you see all the rules outside there cannot
[time=2736] control what's inside here Simon's stylities went up on his pole and he lived on his pole
[time=2742] for years and you'll know why he came down he said I was up there and I was tormented
[time=2748] by my own lustful thoughts I mean he was up there he never saw anybody he never talked
[time=2754] anybody for years yet his own heart was driven and consumed by lust and all the work on the
[time=2761] outside cannot do what the spirit alone can do on the inside fourthly and finally today
[time=2770] I would give you some insights to consider I have eight of them perhaps you would have
[time=2779] more probably you'd have less my insights are these one it's my personal observation
[time=2788] that far more people are hurt than are helped by legalism it's only my observation I do
[time=2795] not have scripture I do not have empirical documentation it's just what I've seen in my short lifetime that more people are hurt than helped by legalism this past week I was with
[time=2806] a pastor of another church we're talking about churches and he said unsolicited I cannot
[time=2812] tell you of one family in our church not one family who has grown children who are walking
[time=2820] with the Lord I said why is that he said because in the past the church has been so legalistic
[time=2828] that they have driven the searching youth and the searching adults away they said wow
[time=2837] if that's Christianity include me out legalism is stifling it is smothering it is squelching
[time=2849] and it does far more damage than it ever does good you see what happens in the legalistic
[time=2857] system is we stand up and we say God said thou shall not commit immorality and then we
[time=2865] say and God said you have to wear a suit and a tie to church and about age 15 the kid reads
[time=2873] the description discovers God never said anything about a suit and tie and he said the preacher lied to me about the suit and tie he probably lied to me about immorality too I think I'll try them both legalism hurts far more people than it ever helps my second observation is
[time=2891] this one we confuse we confuse commandments with convictions before I go any further I
[time=2902] want to plead with you to have strong clear convictions in your life things that are stones that that mark your line and you don't cross them convictions that may not be God's commandments
[time=2917] but we should never measure somebody else's are our own spirituality based upon convictions
[time=2923] only upon commandments let me give you an illustration where I got caught my personal
[time=2932] conviction about going to the theater is I basically don't go to the theater because I don't want everybody to come say he went to the theater I mean I just don't need the grief but I'm not going to raise my kids and say children Bambi is sinful because you know
[time=2950] Bambi runs around on the screen with no clothes on and we're just not going to go see that so we let our kids go to the cartoons the five older mouses and the things like that but I don't go to the theater I go to a Billy Graham film that's being released there or
[time=2966] something like that but I just I just don't want to walk in the theater and have you say oh what are you doing here and I'd say oh same thing you are but we don't even want to get into that that's why don't go now let me give you a story Billy Graham's releasing
[time=2983] a film a time to run it's going to go to the theaters and I'm going to go to that and I've got a friend I'm going to invite I remember the friend I invited he's here today but before they released that film they were going to give a pastor's premiere showing at eight o'clock Saturday morning Southtown theater so I got some tickets I got two of them I said to George Lantman do you want to go to the theater with me I had Billy Graham film pastors premiere showing he got a hesitate and he said yeah I'll go we got there we sat down we're waiting for it to start and I said George I bet it's a long time since you've been in the theater when did you last go you said I was never in one till you drug me here this morning that's a good conviction form all the convictions you want and then
[time=3028] live by them but don't ever say you have to live by my convictions you're not spiritual
[time=3036] because you don't abstain from the things that I abstain from we've got to separate what are convictions from what our commandments a third observation I'd give you as we confuse
[time=3051] issues of health with issues of holiness we can use issues of health with issues of holiness
[time=3063] I began this morning by telling you about Charles Haddon Spurgeon is confrontation over big long cigars the man who pointed that inadequacy out to Spurgeon was DL Moody who tipped the
[time=3076] scales at over 300 pounds and when Moody said his rebuke to Spurgeon Spurgeon took a long
[time=3085] puff on his cigar blew the smoke out and said and I perceive Mr. Moody that you like to eat
[time=3093] but if it is unhealthy for us to smoke and it is it's just as unhealthy for us to eat
[time=3100] to access you know in the times in which Moody lived you were considered more manly the bigger
[time=3107] you got in the late 1800s and the early 1900s a big man was a big man and we elected William
[time=3116] Howard Taft as President of the United States at a whopping 325 pounds he took a bath in the White House and he got stuck they had to call plumber to get him out now today that
[time=3128] if you don't look lean and mean there's something unspiritual let me make a point really clear
[time=3136] I am categorically unconditionally absolutely and totally opposed to smoking now if I was
[time=3144] the pastor of a Baptist Church just like this one in southern Virginia I'd say I am categorically
[time=3151] absolutely opposed to smoking because everybody there works for RJ Reynolds not everybody
[time=3157] some of them work at Philip Morris the point is that is a health issue we we need to say
[time=3163] it's a health issue but we better not say it's a commandment we confuse health issues
[time=3172] with spiritual issues one's health the other's holiness a fourth observation I would ask
[time=3180] you to consider is that we confuse social issues with spiritual issues there's a spiritual
[time=3189] issue about modesty but wouldn't I be modestly dressed if I came today to speak in a pair
[time=3197] of Levi's jeans high top tennis shoes with no laces a t-shirt with the sleeves ripped
[time=3203] off of it and unshaven for two days that's modest that's the only spiritual issue of course
[time=3210] I would empty the church in two Sundays of such behavior but we often make social issues
[time=3219] spiritual issues and they're not I am trying to negotiate a battle in our family I have
[time=3227] a problem with my son my son is very blunt and he's to the point he's looked me in the
[time=3234] eye for two years and he says dad I hate church he's got two objections to church first is
[time=3242] my preaching dad what's what's church tonight if it's a children's musical great if a group
[time=3252] singing wonderful if they're a film marvelous if I'm speaking do I have to go the second
[time=3260] objection he has with church is hard shoes if he can wear tennis shoes he doesn't mind
[time=3266] it but he has to get dressed up and wear hard shoes then what anything to do with it I made
[time=3273] a decision if he'll stop saying he hates my preaching he can wear tennis shoes the church we're working on that trade but you know I have a friend who's a pastor who got criticized
[time=3285] and eventually left the church because his son didn't wear hard shoes the church just
[time=3291] ten years ago you may have an idea of what I ought to wear and what you ought to wear and what our kids ought to wear and those are far those are social issues they're not spiritual don't ever confuse the two I look with a jealous eye at you men who do not have
[time=3306] ties on this morning one eye is approving the other eye is jealous fifth thing we confuse
[time=3317] irritation with issues let me see if I can split the church here in two minutes let me
[time=3325] give you an irritation that some of you thinks an issue some of you like music that
[time=3332] is soft and quiet and melodious others if you like the music so loud that it kind of
[time=3339] moves your chair and there is nothing spiritual about either one of them but to some of us
[time=3347] music that's too soft that's irritating to others of us music it's too loud is irritating
[time=3354] but we want to make it a spiritual issue what's exciting to see is when you have a group before standing here on the steps and two of them are going like this that's a cue to the sound man to turn the monitor up they want it louder and two of them are going like this that's a cue that it's too loud you know what the sound man does goes like this he puts his hands about six inches above the knobs and he goes like this and they both think they're getting it their way and they're happy he never touches the dial you see those
[time=3381] are irritations they are not spiritual issues you can play music as soft as you want and
[time=3387] you can play it as loud as you want and there's not one thing spiritual about it but it can be down right irritating and you can say it irritates just don't make it an issue a sixth
[time=3400] thing I would ask you to consider when the focus of the ministry is on what we don't do instead of what we do do get out it's too late if the posture of the ministry is we
[time=3413] don't drink cuss smoke or cheer around girls who do ready to do where the boys from the institute forget it the church needs to have the posture what is your church we're a place
[time=3424] that's trying to find new ways of building bridges to people who don't know Christ we're
[time=3430] a church that's trying to learn how to embrace people who have needs and who come from broken backgrounds that we've never even considered we want to find a way of loving them into the body of Christ what is your church it's a place where we come the study God's word because nobody says about life that's what we do it's a place where we care for each
[time=3449] other and supportive of each other if the church says well what's our church about why we don't and that's all they have to say get out it's too late seven thing I would have
[time=3461] for you to consider is this there are joy robbers out there shape your own thinking if
[time=3468] I have a conviction and I share it with you and it's not yours don't let me rob you of your joy if you're not violating God's commandment don't let Bill gothard don't let Billy Graham
[time=3480] Chuck Swindall our Jerry Falwell the Pope or anybody else none of us underlying none
[time=3488] of us are inspired first Timothy four three says for everything God created is good and
[time=3495] nothing is to be rejected if it's received with thanksgiving first Timothy 6 17 God has
[time=3506] provided us with everything for our enjoyment dr. Graham Mackey put it this way it's not the
[time=3513] non use of things that become sinful it's the abuse of things that becomes sinful
[time=3534] if as a result of today's broadcast you've come to the place in your spiritual life where you know you need to receive Christ the Savior I want to ask you to follow me in a simple prayer now or Jesus I know that I am a sinner and I ask you to come into my heart and forgive
