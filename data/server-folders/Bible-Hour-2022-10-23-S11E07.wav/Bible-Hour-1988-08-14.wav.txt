[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] (bell ringing) It used to be our concern within the church
[time=116] that we might become so heavenly-minded that we were no earthly good.
[time=121] Now the reality is reversed.
[time=124] The people of churches have become so earthly-minded.
[time=128] We have to wonder, are they any heavenly good?
[time=131] (dramatic music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=148] Thank you for joining us.
[time=150] Today, Rick is continuing his series from the book of Colossians with a message he has entitled, "Producing Christian Conduct." Spiritual character is a banishing quality from our society and tragically our churches as well.
[time=164] Elmer Gantry is no longer a fictional novel, but the harsh headlines of the news.
[time=169] Pulpits are platforms for personal gain, and pews are filled with those who can only tolerate entertainment.
[time=176] Colossians 3 introduces us to the demand for spiritual character.
[time=180] Today's lessons gives us three principles for producing spiritual character.
[time=184] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=189] Rick's text is taken from Colossians chapter 3 verses one through four.
[time=195] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=197] Other special music includes a song from Rejoice and Kevin Roll.
[time=206] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=214] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=218] Now, here's Rick.
[time=222] - It is a joy to welcome you this morning to our worship service.
[time=226] We trust that God will use these moments in our life to deepen our commitment to him.
[time=232] We are thankful you've come to worship with us, and we're thankful for our privilege of sharing this church service with our friends who join us for the Bible hour.
[time=241] There's a great old hymn of the faith that talks about the relationship that we can have in Christ that gives us power and victory in our spiritual walk.
[time=251] It's the old hymn Victory in Jesus.
[time=253] Our choir sings it this morning with a new air of majesty, and I hope that that old hymn gives some new vibrancy to your walk with Christ.
[time=263] ("Pomp and Circumstance") [MUSIC - 203 seconds]
[time=473] - Through the victory in Jesus Christ,
[time=486] we can give God the glory for things that He accomplishes in our lives, indeed for His glory.
[time=490] To God be the glory, great things.
[time=492] He hath done Him number 52, please.
[time=495] Him number 52.
[time=497] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=619] - We'll sing the third stanza now after we've sung the stanza part.
[time=623] When we get to the chorus, just close your book and sing with great enthusiasm.
[time=627] Praise the Lord for the great things He's done in our lives.
[time=631] [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=687] - Amen, thank you for your good singing.
[time=692] Just a few weeks to go, one of our choir members, Byron Hoover gave me a pin that says we're excited.
[time=699] Having come off two weeks of vacation and being away from the church and you all, coming back to see the progress of the building and then the fellowship here is indeed a time for excitement knowing that God is working in our midst here and we're grateful for that.
[time=713] And we're glad that you're here today to fellowship and to worship and we pray that this will be indeed a time when you will be refreshed today.
[time=721] Our music today is already alluded to the fact that only Jesus can give the victory in our lives and if we had all the riches of the world, certainly we could not purchase salvation.
[time=731] It is indeed a gift through Jesus Christ our Savior.
[time=735] Listen to rejoice now as they sing a song, "It Wouldn't Be Enough." [MUSIC] If I had all the riches [MUSIC] This world has to give [MUSIC] All the comfort that it brings [MUSIC] Is never needing anything [MUSIC] I could search the whole world over far and wide [MUSIC] Trying to find this precious love [MUSIC] That was sent from God above [MUSIC] But it wouldn't be enough [MUSIC] No it wouldn't be enough [MUSIC] To buy what's winter of the tree [MUSIC] But Jesus died on [MUSIC] And I couldn't need a prize [MUSIC] For one single drop of blood [MUSIC] That was shed for my salvation [MUSIC] If I had all the riches [MUSIC] This world has to give [MUSIC] And I gave it all away [MUSIC] Every penny to my name [MUSIC] To some bigger one [MUSIC] Life's dark and lonely street [MUSIC] All this highness found in me [MUSIC] Could not win eternity [MUSIC] And it wouldn't be enough [MUSIC] No it wouldn't be enough [MUSIC] To buy what's winter of the tree [MUSIC] That Jesus died on [MUSIC] And I couldn't need a prize [MUSIC] For one single drop of blood [MUSIC] That was shed for my salvation [MUSIC] And it wouldn't be enough [MUSIC] No it wouldn't be enough [MUSIC] To buy what's winter of the tree [MUSIC] That Jesus died on [MUSIC] And I couldn't pay the price [MUSIC] For one single drop of blood [MUSIC] That was shed for my salvation [MUSIC] Oh no it wouldn't be enough [MUSIC] To be enough [MUSIC] Face to the king of kings [MUSIC] For he alone is grand and glorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of our salvation [MUSIC] Face to the king of righteousness [MUSIC] Face to the God of new creation glorify him [MUSIC] And praise his holy name [MUSIC] Face to the king of kings [MUSIC] For he is crowned with truth and righteousness [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he is clothed with joy and faithfulness [MUSIC] Face to the Lord for he is glorious [MUSIC] Calling his children to the throne [MUSIC] Face to the Lord our God victorious [MUSIC] Coming again to glorify his own [MUSIC] Face to the king of kings [MUSIC] For he alone is grand and glorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the king of our salvation [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of righteousness [MUSIC] Face to the God of new creation glorify him [MUSIC] And praise his holy name [MUSIC] Gloria [MUSIC] Gloria [MUSIC] Face to the king of kings [MUSIC] For he alone is righteousness [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the king of kings [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of lords [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] We will worship you, O Lord, in power of love you've given us [MUSIC] You, O Lord, are true and worthy [MUSIC] We will glorify your name [MUSIC] Fill us with your spirit holy in the love and power of Jesus' name [MUSIC] Face to the king of kings [MUSIC] For he alone is grand and glorious [MUSIC] Face to the king of kings [MUSIC] For he alone will reign victorious [MUSIC] Face to the king of our salvation [MUSIC] Face to the Lord of righteousness [MUSIC] Face to the God of new creation [MUSIC] Glorab by him and praise his holy name [MUSIC] Face to the Lord [MUSIC] Praise to the king â™ª
[time=1317] [audience applauding]
[time=1326] - Thank you, Kevin.
[time=1327] I only have one regret with that song, that it's not an eight-minute song instead of a two-minute song.
[time=1334] Something so great about a song that gives us the perspective that knowing Jesus Christ and worshiping him gives life its joy and its fullness and we are alive in him this morning.
[time=1348] Oh, God, we worship you today.
[time=1350] Lord Jesus, we proclaim that you are a risen savior and we've come today to shout out the good news that he is alive.
[time=1358] We love you, Lord, and we are selfish in our worship today for we have learned that when we praise your name, we get lifted up.
[time=1369] And we wanna thank you for the exhilaration of our own spirit that we've received this morning in singing praises to your name and hearing your name exalted.
[time=1379] Thank you for this hour of worship.
[time=1381] And may we live a life of integrity and consistency so that our worship is not on the expression of our song.
[time=1388] But of our walk, oh, God, give us that integrity today.
[time=1393] We pray that your spirit would meet and that you would meet the need of each one who is here today.
[time=1400] We pray that there would come a comfort to those who have lost loved ones, particularly for Greg and Sue Blaugh and the death of their brother-in-law, for Vanni Johnson and the death of her father, for the dells and the wagners who lost children at the beginning of the summer.
[time=1418] Oh, God, we ask you to give a comfort that you can give, that we know we cannot.
[time=1424] We ask you to give strength to those who are going through trials.
[time=1429] Some are being tried by their employer.
[time=1433] Others are being tried by their spouses.
[time=1437] Many are being tried by their parents, more by their children.
[time=1442] God, today, give them a perspective that is bigger than themselves, a strength that comes from you.
[time=1450] We pray that you'll help those who are facing trials of temptation, those who are considering compromise.
[time=1457] Would you convict them today and give them courage to walk in obedience?
[time=1462] And as we study your word, we ask you to make it food for our being.
[time=1468] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1474] In 1927, Sinclair Lewis published a fictitious novel with the title, Elmer Gantry.
[time=1483] Some of you read that in American literature class years ago, but Elmer Gantry is the story of the enthusiastic revival preaching Christian who becomes victim himself to the vices that he had told others to avoid.
[time=1502] That was fiction.
[time=1504] That was just a story.
[time=1506] Today, it's not 1927, it's not fiction.
[time=1511] It's headline news.
[time=1513] And the crying question of our society is this, is there any integrity in Christianity?
[time=1522] I received a tape from one of my favorite Bible teachers.
[time=1525] His name is John MacArthur.
[time=1527] Many of you would know that name.
[time=1529] And John was speaking of the need for integrity amongst Christians today, and he began with this statement.
[time=1536] The fall of Jimmy Swigert is the greatest calamity that has hit Christianity in centuries.
[time=1543] Now, as a preacher, I listened to preaching with somewhat of a critical ear, and I thought, now that's a sensational statement.
[time=1550] I mean, that's really overkill that.
[time=1552] That first one liner that zips him, the greatest calamity in centuries.
[time=1558] Then he went on, he said this.
[time=1561] He said, when Jimmy Baker fell, and all of his affairs financially and sexually became public, the watching world said, I wonder, are all Christians like that?
[time=1574] And then when Jimmy Swigert fell, the watching world said, yeah, they are.
[time=1583] They're all like that.
[time=1585] I have to agree that John was right.
[time=1588] That may be the greatest calamity.
[time=1590] That has hit Christianity in centuries.
[time=1593] Because all of society now looks at Christianity and says, is there any integrity at all?
[time=1601] The other night, we had 25 new and old friends over to our house.
[time=1605] Not everyone knew each other.
[time=1606] So we went around the room, you know how you hate doing that, you introduce yourself and say what your job is and all that.
[time=1612] We'd gotten pretty near the end of the line, and Chuck said, well, my name's Chuck, and I have one of those questionable jobs.
[time=1619] I'm a parts salesman for automobiles.
[time=1622] Everybody chuckled, oh, yeah, you know how those car people are.
[time=1626] The next guy was Gary and Gary said, well, my job, even as less integrity than that, I sell insurance, and everybody chuckled at that.
[time=1635] And the next guy in a row, David said, well, I can top those guys.
[time=1640] I'm a realtor.
[time=1641] And I was the next guy.
[time=1644] And it really struck me.
[time=1649] I don't know who is more trustworthy, or least trustworthy in our society today.
[time=1656] If it is a preacher, you may have double reason to be suspicious.
[time=1662] No integrity.
[time=1664] In pews or in pulpits.
[time=1668] When I became a Christian in the late '60s, I looked at Christians and I saw this extremely narrow-minded group.
[time=1677] The women all wore their hair in a bun that was pulled back and their eyes bugged out, and you thought, oh, Lord, don't make me marry a person like that.
[time=1685] And we looked at Christians and we said, okay, we'll become one.
[time=1689] But these Christians are so heavenly-minded, they're no earthly good.
[time=1694] And now we look at churches and we say, these Christians, we are so earthly-minded, we're no heavenly good.
[time=1703] Integrity.
[time=1707] What produces spiritual integrity in our lives?
[time=1712] As we've studied through the book of Colossians, we have found four things that do not produce spiritual growth.
[time=1722] The first thing that does not produce spiritual growth according to Colossians is philosophy.
[time=1727] You can accumulate wisdom, you can love knowledge, you can pursue it, you can capture it, you can speak it, but it doesn't produce spiritual growth.
[time=1737] There is no correlation between how much we know and how well we live.
[time=1743] Philosophy cannot produce spiritual growth.
[time=1746] The second thing Colossians teaches us is that religion does not produce spiritual growth.
[time=1753] You can go to church, you can go to this church, you can join the church, you can be baptized in the church, you can be sprinkled, you can be poured, you can be dunked, you can be dunked one time, you can be dunked three times, you can be dunked forward, you can be dunked backwards, you can take communion, you can take it weekly, you can take it monthly, you can have a common cup, you can have little cups and all of that doesn't produce any spiritual growth.
[time=1776] Religion does nothing.
[time=1778] Third thing that does not produce spiritual growth is mysticism.
[time=1784] Oh, I just feel so good about God.
[time=1786] I mean, I just got blessed and what he said or what she sang and I just feel and I've been touched and I was in my closet and I heard this mysticism.
[time=1796] It doesn't do anything to produce spiritual growth.
[time=1800] The fourth thing that Colossians tells us that does not produce spiritual growth is legalism.
[time=1807] Don't wear that.
[time=1809] You must wear this.
[time=1811] You've got to be here on Sunday, Sunday school, church, Sunday night, Wednesday night, Thursday morning, Saturday night, Monday, it doesn't produce legalism.
[time=1820] Thou shalls and thou shall nots that did not originate in God and in His word.
[time=1826] Any man-made command doesn't produce spiritual growth.
[time=1831] Well, after four weeks, some of you may be coming frustrated and saying, okay, you've taken four weeks, one chapter of Colossians and you've told us what doesn't work, we're dying to know what does work.
[time=1844] Do you have a Bible open to Colossians chapter three?
[time=1847] If you don't know where Colossians is, notice in the front of your Bible, there'll be a table of contents.
[time=1853] We're in the New Testament about halfway back Colossians chapter three.
[time=1858] It reads like this in verse one.
[time=1863] Since then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[time=1875] Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
[time=1880] For you died and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
[time=1885] When Christ who is your life appears, then you will also appear with Him in glory.
[time=1895] I would like to pull out of this passage three principles that do produce spiritual character and then next week a fourth.
[time=1905] The first principle I see here is the principle of spiritual power.
[time=1913] Look at chapter three, verse one.
[time=1916] Since then, you have been raised with Christ.
[time=1921] Got that in your mind?
[time=1924] Look back to chapter two, verse 20.
[time=1926] You'll see a very parallel construction.
[time=1929] Since you died with Christ three, one, since you have been raised with Christ.
[time=1938] The principle of spiritual power is this, that we have a spirit component to us.
[time=1945] Just like you have eyes and ears, hands and legs, a body and a mind, emotions and a wilt, there's another part called a spirit.
[time=1956] And that spirit is born sinful.
[time=1960] The Bible says in Colossians two, thirteen.
[time=1963] When you were dead in your trespasses and sins, we are dead.
[time=1969] Then it says, we died with Christ and we're buried and now we are raised.
[time=1976] There's an old spirit in us who is dead.
[time=1980] We have died and we are free from that old dead man.
[time=1985] A generation ago, a very popular group was out by the name of the Imperials and they had a song that had these words to it.
[time=1992] Are you living in an old man's rubble?
[time=1994] Are you listening to the father of lies?
[time=1998] It speaks about the fact that there is an old Rick Hawks, but Jesus said, I've crucified that spirit, he is dead.
[time=2008] Now some of us have to ask the question, if that old nature is dead, why do I still sin?
[time=2016] Well, there are a number of reasons and let me share several with you.
[time=2019] One reason is many of us are still listening to the old dead man and we are still following him and we are still dragging him through our life.
[time=2029] You've heard the story about these four guys, they played golf together every Saturday morning at seven o'clock, they played quickly and they were always home by 10.30.
[time=2038] It was 10.30, it was 11, it was 11.30, it was 12.
[time=2041] Finally, John comes home and he looks exhausted.
[time=2044] His wife says, where have you been and what's happened to you?
[time=2048] He said, it was a terrible day.
[time=2049] We teed off on the first hole, we started walking up that big hill, Fred had a heart attack and he dropped dead.
[time=2055] She said, oh that is a terrible morning.
[time=2058] He said, oh it was miserable, 18 holes.
[time=2060] Hit the ball, drag Fred, hit the ball, drag Fred.
[time=2065] He said it took us five hours.
[time=2068] You know what, many of us have this old dead man, the crisis, it's dead and we're going through life, dragging this old dead man and the old dead man's telling us how to live.
[time=2079] The Bible says you've got spiritual power because you not only died when Christ gave you a new birth but you have been raised.
[time=2090] You've been resurrected in the power that raised Christ from the dead is alive and working in each one of us and the whole premise of spiritual character according to this passages, since you've been raised with Christ there's new power, there's new potential.
[time=2107] Paul put it this way, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I but Christ lives in me and this life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the power of the Son of God who died for me.
[time=2125] Spiritual power is available to a Christian to overcome sin.
[time=2130] Well there's a second reason why we still sin as believers.
[time=2135] That reason is that many of us are dead but we just don't know it.
[time=2142] Have you ever heard the expression, he's running around like a chicken with his head cut off?
[time=2147] Do you ever wonder where that came from?
[time=2148] I found out it was a little boy.
[time=2150] I was in the Boy Scouts troop 156 and the group that was in that troop just before us went on a wilderness, rustic, rustic overnight camp out and they had to do everything including having a chicken barbecue starting off with one live chicken.
[time=2170] And they had an old home movie of these guys taking care of the chicken and how they took care of the chicken is they took this chicken, wings flapping, squawking and cackling and they'd pull it between their knees and hold a tent like this and then with their Boy Scout knife they'd cut it off.
[time=2185] Now this is crude but all has a point.
[time=2187] The head would drop on this side, the body on this side and literally on videotape you can see this chicken running around with its head cut off.
[time=2198] For about 15 to 20 seconds, this chicken's going around and around and boom.
[time=2203] But he runs around with his head cut off.
[time=2205] He's dead, he just doesn't know it yet.
[time=2208] And many of us are spiritually dead to sin.
[time=2213] We just don't know it yet.
[time=2214] And so we go through life surrendering to sin thinking it has power over us and it doesn't.
[time=2220] There's a third reason why we still sin even though we have this spiritual power and that is we do not cooperate with God.
[time=2230] And here is the real crux of the issue.
[time=2232] Look at verse three.
[time=2237] It says, "For you died past tense.
[time=2242] "You're dead, it's over." Look at verse five, "Put to death therefore." I mean, if you're dead you don't have to kill it.
[time=2253] There is a subtle truth here that other scholars, why do I say other scholars?
[time=2259] I ain't one.
[time=2260] A scholars have said is called the divine cooperative.
[time=2265] The divine cooperative is this, that God does something for us and then he tells us to do it for ourselves.
[time=2274] Let me give you several biblical illustrations.
[time=2276] One of those is Joshua.
[time=2279] God calls Joshua and he says, "Joshua, Moses is dead.
[time=2282] "You're now the new leader, and this is the land "that I have given you past tense." Then God says, "And every place the soul "of your foot treads upon, that will I give you." I have given it, but you've got to take it.
[time=2298] That's the divine cooperative.
[time=2300] God does for us what we can't do, then he commissions us to do what we can do.
[time=2304] Jesus went up to the tomb of Lazarus.
[time=2308] He was going to raise Lazarus from the dead.
[time=2310] Jesus could have said stone be moved and it would roll away, but Jesus said you move the stone.
[time=2319] And then he told Lazarus to come forth.
[time=2322] Jesus did what only he could do and he made them do what they could do.
[time=2328] In Philippians chapter two, the apostle Paul by inspiration of God says this, "Work out your own salvation "for it is God who both works and wills into you "according to his good pleasure.
[time=2344] "On the one hand it's God, on the other hand it's us.
[time=2349] "This is not the Bible, it's poor Richard's Almanac, "which isn't even close, but Ben Franklin was right "when he said, God does help those "who help themselves.
[time=2360] "God helps us by giving us eternal life "and a brand new spirit with new power "to live victorious, but we have to cooperate with it "and we have to also put the death "every day, old habits that die slow." That's the first principle.
[time=2382] It is the principle of spiritual power that God gives to us.
[time=2388] The second principle is found in that same verse.
[time=2391] Since then you have been raised with Christ, here comes a command, "Set your hearts on things above." In the first principle, our focus was on the spiritual part of our being.
[time=2407] Now the principle moves from the spiritual part of our being to our will, our volitional being, the part of us that chooses.
[time=2417] And it tells us to set our affection on things above.
[time=2422] I call this the principle of self-determination.
[time=2426] Now many of us as Christians are taken back by that phrase, self-determination, because we've heard it taught from a secular viewpoint that you can do it, you're enough.
[time=2436] You can pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
[time=2438] You don't need anybody else.
[time=2441] And I agree that mode of self-determination is inadequate.
[time=2445] By self-determination, I mean, first of all, we receive Christ as Savior, we now have Him in a new spirit in us.
[time=2454] Now we must choose, we must determine ourselves, what is it that I am going to determine and direct my life's pursuits?
[time=2464] What is it that I'm going to seek?
[time=2466] What is it that I'm going to set out as my life's goal?
[time=2471] And set your affection upon these things.
[time=2475] Notice the emphasis is on you doing it to yourself.
[time=2480] This is not something that God's going to do for you.
[time=2482] It's what He tells you to do.
[time=2484] He says you set your affections on things that are above.
[time=2489] You know, in life, most of the things that we like
[time=2496] are things that we learned to like.
[time=2499] Our good habits and our bad ones.
[time=2503] Let me give you some examples.
[time=2505] When I was a little boy, there were no such chains such as Pizza Hut, noble Romans, little Caesars, Domino's, we deliver, you know, the whole pizza empire.
[time=2516] There were just little Mont-Pau shops that made pizza, and we didn't eat pizza very often, but on Saturday nights, my parents would often go to a place called Papa Felices, and they'd bring home this thing, and they called it a pizza, and my sister and I would stand back and look at it.
[time=2532] You know, it had stuff on it.
[time=2534] I mean, weird stuff, you know.
[time=2537] Slice, pepperoni, whatever that is, and olives, and little dead fish.
[time=2542] You know, look, I hated it.
[time=2545] Over the years, we tried it.
[time=2550] Tried it a little bit more.
[time=2552] Now I am addicted to pizza.
[time=2555] I just decided where we're going to lunch today right now.
[time=2561] I have learned to love it.
[time=2564] I crave it, but I used to dislike it.
[time=2568] Two years ago, my little nephew poked me in the stomach,
[time=2574] and at age six, he said, "You're fat, Uncle Rick." (audience laughs) When I looked down at my stomach and I couldn't see his finger, I decided he was right, and I started jogging and biking.
[time=2588] Can I tell you my first thoughts about jogging?
[time=2592] This is crazy.
[time=2593] This is terrible.
[time=2595] This is insane.
[time=2596] I couldn't stand it.
[time=2599] Now I love it.
[time=2601] I've already been out jogging this morning.
[time=2603] I just, I love to exercise.
[time=2605] If I can't jog with bike, if I can't bike with swam, but I didn't like it two years ago.
[time=2609] I had to learn to like it.
[time=2611] I used to look at diet colas as a form of punishment.
[time=2620] Okay, I did it over here, so I got to make up for it over here.
[time=2625] I was one of those crazy people.
[time=2627] You heard him, you're standing at line at McDonald's and you hear the voice over the speaker as he's ordering.
[time=2632] Yeah, give me four big mats, two fries, an ice cream, a couple pies, and a diet Pepsi.
[time=2638] You know, that's gonna make up for all of it.
[time=2640] (audience laughs) I hated it, but over the last two years, I've learned to like it.
[time=2648] And now regular Pepsi tastes funny to me.
[time=2651] The whole point is this.
[time=2652] We learn to light things by setting our affection in that direction.
[time=2658] You know, the same thing is true about our bad habits.
[time=2661] Those of you who over the years smoked, you remember the first time you smoked, you lit up that cigarette and you took one big puff on it and you gagged and you coughed and you spit up parts from the inside of your body and you looked at your body and said, "This is great." (audience laughs) We acted like, "Oh, you had to learn to like that." Every part of your body was saying, "I don't like this.
[time=2683] "I don't need this, get rid of it." But you learn to like it because you want everybody else to view you as the image of that guy.
[time=2691] You see, we learn to like things, whether they're good or bad for us.
[time=2695] And the principle of self-determination says, "You and I must determine what is it "that I'm gonna pursue with this life God's given me." And God says, "Set your affection on things above "where Christ is at the right hand of God." I think what he's saying is you look at Jesus Christ and you say, "My life's determination is I wanna be like him "and I wanna be with him and I'm living for him.
[time=2724] "I wanna do the things that please him.
[time=2727] "And if I like those, great, if I don't, "after the 40th or 50th time, I'll start liking him "and I'm gonna set my affection on those things." That's the principle that's taught here of self-determination.
[time=2742] It's a difficult one, it is a tough one.
[time=2745] It takes consistency of life.
[time=2749] Every part of life is developmental.
[time=2753] We develop attitudes about church, about music, about food, about people, and we must learn to like what is good for us.
[time=2763] Oliver Wendell Holmes once said these words, "It's not as important where a man stands "as what direction he's facing." Some of us right now have spent years of spiritual mediocrity.
[time=2779] Neither you nor I can undo the past.
[time=2784] You may be standing in the wrong spot, but you can change and face a new direction.
[time=2790] Self-determination.
[time=2794] You have to determine where it is you want to go.
[time=2799] The third and final principle that I would share with you this morning is the principle of positive thinking.
[time=2808] Look if you will at chapter three, verse two.
[time=2811] Set your mind on things above, not on earthly things.
[time=2817] By the principle of positive thinking, I don't mean the little train who said, "I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can." That's great, and that type of positive thinking will accomplish something.
[time=2832] But by positive thinking, I mean this.
[time=2834] We've looked at the spirit, you've got to have spiritual power, we've looked at the will, you've got to have self-determination.
[time=2841] Now we've got to look at the mind and say, "If I want to become a positive dynamic Christian, "have to form my mental habits on positive spiritual values." It has been said, "You are what you eat." And that's basically true.
[time=2859] It is also true, "You are what you think." Proverb says, "As a man thinks in his heart, so he is." And whatever we focus our mind on
[time=2875] will soon become what we focus our behavior on because thinking precedes action.
[time=2883] And the Bible here says we have to take our mind and we have to set our mind on thinking about things that are above.
[time=2893] Perhaps you heard the story about the man who went to the psychologist.
[time=2898] Psychologist was trying to get at the root of his problem, so he gave him the ink spot test.
[time=2903] There's just ink spots on a card and you tell the doctor what you see.
[time=2906] So the doctor held up the first card.
[time=2908] He said, "What do you see?" And the man looked at me and said, "Oh, I see sex." Held up the second card, he said, "What do you see?" He said, "Oh, I see more of the same." Held up the third card, he said, "What do you see?" And the man said, "Oh, I see the same thing." Held up the fourth card, he said, "What do you see?" And the man said, "I see more sex." Well, the doctor slapped the cards down and said, "Buddy, I can tell you what's wrong with you.
[time=2927] "You are obsessed with sex." The man said, "Me, you're the guy with all the dirty pictures." (audience laughs) The point is this.
[time=2938] What you think determines what you are.
[time=2943] Flip back to the book of Philippians, just for a moment, Philippians is one book back, the fourth chapter, the eighth verse.
[time=2954] It says this, "Finally, brothers, whatever is true,
[time=2964] "whatever is noble, whatever is right, "whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
[time=2975] "whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent "or praiseworthy, think on such things." That is the principle of positive thinking.
[time=2989] We must take our minds and focus it in on the values that God has for us.
[time=2997] Now, this type of thinking is gonna be brand new and it has three phases.
[time=3003] We have to have new principles to consider, new processes to conduct, and new preoccupations to be consumed by.
[time=3015] Let me illustrate for you.
[time=3017] For many of us, we have an old principle.
[time=3021] The old principle is, my life is to make a big name for myself as a money man.
[time=3027] A new principle says, my goal in life is to make a new name
[time=3033] for myself as a man of spiritual character and integrity.
[time=3038] See the old principle and the new principle?
[time=3040] Now you've gotta go through new thought processes.
[time=3043] The old thought process says, if I'm gonna make money, then I've gotta get ahead, I've gotta pad accounts, I've gotta shave corners, I've gotta cut cause, I've gotta skim over.
[time=3053] The new thought process says, if I want a character and a good name, then I've gotta go through a new thought process.
[time=3062] I've gotta learn to be honest.
[time=3064] I've gotta learn to be transparent.
[time=3066] I've gotta learn to tell people the things that maybe it's their job to figure out for themselves.
[time=3071] I've gotta take what's in the small print and highlight it in yellow.
[time=3075] And if you go through that new processes, you'll come away with a new preoccupation.
[time=3083] The old preoccupation ought to be significant self.
[time=3086] I've gotta have some flash goods, you know, something to show off.
[time=3089] The new preoccupation is, I want character.
[time=3093] I want integrity.
[time=3095] The Bible here says that we've got to change our entire process of thinking, that we have to set our minds on things above, which is character, which is Christ-likeness, integrity, all the things we read out of Philippians that it said.
[time=3114] Think on these things.
[time=3118] For some of you, you're looking at all this and you're saying this is too radical.
[time=3122] Verse three gives us his reasoning.
[time=3125] Paul's given us some tough principles here.
[time=3130] And now he gives us an explanation.
[time=3131] Notice it starts with the word four.
[time=3133] That's a conjunctive, that's a clause that follows that says the reasoning that I've already said that, it's for this reason, and he gives us five reasons.
[time=3142] Let me give them to you quickly.
[time=3144] One, you are dead.
[time=3148] For you died.
[time=3149] Why do you listen to a dead man's voice?
[time=3154] It's over with.
[time=3158] You're dead to those things and move on and enjoy life spiritually.
[time=3164] Reasoning number two, you're hidden with Christ.
[time=3168] That word hidden has that concept of protection.
[time=3173] It is that notion that as we go through the spiritual struggles, there is that around us which protects us, like the police officer who wears a motorcycle helmet, it is his protection.
[time=3185] Like the soldier who carries his shield, it is his protection.
[time=3189] Christ is our protection.
[time=3192] He hides us.
[time=3195] Thirdly, your life is Christ.
[time=3199] If your friends were to describe you in one sentence that began, his life is, or her life is, what would they say?
[time=3211] Would they say his life is sports?
[time=3216] His life is his money, his life is his car, his life is his house, her life is music, her life is her kids.
[time=3224] Hert, what would they say?
[time=3226] Or would they say his life is Christ.
[time=3231] Paul said for me to live is Christ and to die,
[time=3238] it's game.
[time=3240] My pastor, the man who led me to Christ, said in his life as a high school student, his God was his football.
[time=3252] And for him to live was football.
[time=3255] He said that when I was a high school student and it convicted my heart that my life was swimming.
[time=3263] It was my God.
[time=3266] What is your life today?
[time=3270] Is it Christ?
[time=3272] The fourth thing he says is, your Lord will appear.
[time=3279] He says the Lord will appear, what does he mean by that?
[time=3282] I believe what he means by that is the Bible, he's here demanding a sacrificial lifestyle.
[time=3289] It's like a man or a woman who takes enormous amounts of the money they could be living on and invests it over here and they don't touch it to a retirement.
[time=3299] But over here it grows and it grows and it grows and then they retire and all of their investment and more comes back to them.
[time=3309] The Bible says that Jesus Christ will appear and when he comes he will bring back our investment and like a conquering general who appears, we fifthly will be with him.
[time=3322] In just one month's time we will be watching the Olympics and there'll be a platform.
[time=3327] One man will stand higher than everyone but two.
[time=3331] A second man will stand even higher than him, higher than everyone but one and the winner will stand higher than all of them on the elevated platform and we'll look at it and say wow, wouldn't it be great to appear like that?
[time=3347] There's a day when Jesus Christ is coming again and he's going to appear and we will appear with him and every Olympic gold medal winner will see Christ returning us with him and they're gonna stand there with the gold around their neck and they're gonna go wow, wouldn't it be great to appear like that?
[time=3368] That's why it makes sense for us to live for Christ now.
[time=3373] The third principle is the principle of positive thinking
[time=3380] and that is focusing our mind to thinking about God's values.
[time=3385] Let me give you the simple way to get a grip on God's word.
[time=3389] Comes out of the navigator studies, five things you need to know and do if you're gonna get a grip on God's word so you can think positively.
[time=3397] First thing you have to do is you have to hear God's word regularly, that's what you're doing now, that's what you're doing in an ABF meeting, adult Bible fellowship, that's what you can do by listening to Christian radio and tapes.
[time=3409] The Bible tells us faith comes by hearing and hearing by God's word.
[time=3414] Second thing you have to do to get a grip on the Bible is you have to read it for yourself.
[time=3419] Revelation one, three, bless it is he who reads this book.
[time=3426] Third thing to get a grip on the word is you must not only read it, you have to study it.
[time=3430] You can't skim it, you can't peruse it, you've gotta study it.
[time=3434] Says in Acts chapter 17 verse 11 that they were noble
[time=3440] for they searched the scriptures to see if these things were so.
[time=3444] Done any digging lately?
[time=3446] Fourth thing you have to do if you wanna get a grip on this word is you have to meditate on it.
[time=3454] Meditate means I've done more than study it for its academic value.
[time=3458] I've contemplated this passage and I've determined here's how it fits my life.
[time=3464] Here's what God wants me to do.
[time=3466] Here's where I go from here.
[time=3469] The fifth and final thing to do is to memorize it.
[time=3473] To not only apply it, but to say I wanna know it for the rest of my life, I will memorize it.
[time=3479] I wanna ask you to look in your bulletin over this next week and memorize Colossians 1-3.
[time=3485] Next Sunday morning we'll stand together and we'll say it together that we can memorize God's word.
[time=3491] Would you have spiritual character?
[time=3492] Three simple principles.
[time=3494] The principle of spiritual power, the principle of self-determination, and the principle of positive thinking.
[time=3512] (gentle music) We've been sharing with you the musical ministry
[time=3524] of our sanctuary choir, rejoice, and soloist Kevin Rowe.
[time=3528] A message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3531] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal savior.
[time=3536] Before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3540] Will you bow your head and pray?
[time=3542] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3550] And today I know that I'm a sinner and I need to confess my sins before you.
[time=3554] I ask you to come into my heart and cleanse me from the sins that I've committed.
[time=3559] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3562] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3567] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
