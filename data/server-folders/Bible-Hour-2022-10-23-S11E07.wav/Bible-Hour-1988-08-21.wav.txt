[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] (bells ringing) One of the humorous events of the circus coming in town
[time=114] is the clown.
[time=115] The clown who appears to be a tall man and very heavy and then he begins to take off one coat and then another, then a third, then a fourth, then a fifth, and he's nothing but layer upon layer of clothing, and actually he's standing there on stilts, and on the inside he's a very small man, but he's covered with layer upon layer of clothing.
[time=139] Looking deep on the inside you find the real man.
[time=144] The Bible tells us in Colossians that God says, "Take off all those external layers and get down to the real man and then put on a new one, Christ Jesus." (bells ringing) Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship
[time=173] on the Bible hour.
[time=174] Thank you for joining us.
[time=176] Rick's message today is taken from the book of Colossians and is entitled "The Principle of Positive Replacement." Today's message is in the second in a two-part series on producing Christian character.
[time=188] If you missed last week's "Don't Be Concerned," Rick will begin today's study with a brief review of last week's key points to bring you up today.
[time=197] This study focuses on the principles of positive replacement found in several places in the Bible, and particularly in Colossians chapter 3.
[time=207] Too many of us says Christians are like a circus clown, wearing layer upon layer of clothing, trying to cover up the real person underneath.
[time=216] What is the real you after the facades are dropped?
[time=219] Today we will learn to drop all the images and layers of camouflage and to put on Christ Jesus.
[time=226] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to Colossians chapter 3.
[time=230] We'll be looking at verses 5 through 14.
[time=233] The sanctuary choir will be administering to us in song.
[time=237] We will also be hearing from Joni King.
[time=242] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=250] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=255] Now here's Rick.
[time=256] I'm delighted that you've come, and we want to welcome you this morning to our worship service, and also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=265] As we've come to this place, we've come that we might be instructed by song, by music, by testimony, by study of the scriptures to live for Christ.
[time=275] It's our joy to worship Him now.
[time=286] Sing unto the Lord unto song.
[time=291] Let His praises fill the temple.
[time=297] He is King of kings and the Lord of boths.
[time=302] Bow down before Him.
[time=307] Sing unto the Lord unto song.
[time=311] Let His praises fill the temple.
[time=317] He is King of kings and the Lord of boths.
[time=322] Bow down before Him.
[time=326] Bow away to God.
[time=345] Sing unto the Lord unto song.
[time=349] For He loves to hear our praises.
[time=354] Let all our creations sing, glory to our God.
[time=359] Bow down before Him.
[time=363] Bow away to God.
[time=368] Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God.
[time=395] Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God.
[time=407] Sing unto the Lord and your soul, let his praises spill his own.
[time=416] He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, bow down before him.
[time=425] Hallelujah, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God.
[time=452] Hallelujah, glory to God, glory to God.
[time=482] The Lord loves it when we come together and we sing praises to his name and of course
[time=501] give honor to that name.
[time=503] We are amazed and we sing songs like I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene
[time=509] and wonder how he could love me a sinner condemned unclean but indeed he came to save
[time=516] people just like you and me.
[time=518] It is amazing yet it is the truth that God indeed came to save sinners like you and
[time=524] me and can it be we will be singing in just a moment 186 we will sing the first third and
[time=531] fifth stanzas together this great hymn it takes all of our enthusiasm and strength to
[time=537] sing a song of this magnitude so join with me as we sing heartily one hundred eighty six.
[time=568] Hallelujah, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory
[time=906] Welcome again to today's broadcast of the Bible hour.
[time=927] I'm sure we have many old friends joining us today, but we want to say a special word of welcome to some new friends who join us for the first time here at the Bible hour.
[time=937] Coming to us is a new opportunity to minister in California on channel 64, KFTL in San
[time=946] Leandro, California.
[time=948] We are welcoming those new friends to the Bible hour today, and Pete, that's a familiar place to you.
[time=953] Yes, Rick, just a few years ago, my father had a pastorate there in San Leandro.
[time=957] He now lives in Walnut Creek and I was just through there about two weeks ago.
[time=961] That's a great area, a lot of people in that area, it's very, very busy.
[time=965] I'm sure many of them perhaps do remember pastor Kobe's ministry in those days.
[time=971] I hope so.
[time=972] Well, we're delighted that you have all joined us today, our old friends and new alike.
[time=977] You may or may not be aware of the fact that we are in the final stages of a building program, making a new home for the ministry of Blackhawk Baptist Church and the Bible hour.
[time=987] And we're looking forward to sharing some tape of that building progress in just a moment.
[time=991] But we want to wet your appetite for a special day coming first, September the 11th.
[time=996] Well, Rick, we've been advertising that Buddy Green is going to be here.
[time=1000] Buddy Green plays the harmonica.
[time=1002] You might find that a bit unusual to have him here in our Sunday morning service and then for a full concert in the evening.
[time=1009] But he plays with great ability and he's very, very instrumental in giving us entertainment
[time=1016] as well as providing a great ministry with that instrument.
[time=1020] Well, both of us kind of turn the corners of our mouth up and smile when we announce that we have a harmonica player coming.
[time=1027] But we've each had the privilege of hearing Buddy Green play and it is an exciting experience.
[time=1032] He can make that little harmonica sound like a 16 piece orchestra, he can play the William
[time=1038] Tell Overture and make it sound as majestic as I've ever heard it play.
[time=1043] It's amazing what he can do with such a small instrument and just a reminder again he's going to be with us, September 11th in our Sunday morning service and then give a full concert at 6 p.m. that same evening.
[time=1054] Well we hope you can join us in person but if you cannot, please do stay tuned to the Bible Hour to enjoy Buddy Green's ministry.
[time=1062] Now we would like to show you the tape I mentioned a moment ago so you can see the progress of construction on our new sanctuary here at Blackhawk in the new home for the Bible Hour.
[time=1072] Rick we have a lovely stained glass window that's going to go right into the area that we're showing you right now.
[time=1077] It's a open Bible that is right in the center of our building and will just be really beautiful.
[time=1084] As you walk through those doors, this is the foyer with a second story there, a little mezzanine that will take you eventually to the balcony area of our sanctuary.
[time=1094] This will be a large meeting place not only to come into our sanctuary but to have some banquets and so forth.
[time=1100] This is the front of our building with the big open area, the baptistry area and right now they are putting the wood paneling up that will go behind the choir all across the front.
[time=1110] That's a beautifully designed wood panel that's kind of convex and is stained beautifully.
[time=1116] These are some areas that they're working on for television.
[time=1118] All of the cable will go in these boxes and will be hidden from the people that come.
[time=1124] We're looking now at the front of the balcony and they're now putting some of the finishing touches on that design there that finishes off our balcony area.
[time=1133] As you look at it from the stage up into the balcony you see that that area will see probably
[time=1140] about 750 people Rick.
[time=1143] Many many men were excited are in the building working on various aspects because we don't
[time=1149] have many days left and they are working very feverously to get the building completed.
[time=1155] The balcony is all cleaned up and ready to go.
[time=1158] We are looking forward to seeing the pews come any day now.
[time=1162] We're also looking at the very finely designed, acoustical treated ceiling that will allow
[time=1169] us to have a good sound in the building.
[time=1174] These are other areas.
[time=1175] This is in fact the studio where television will broadcast from.
[time=1179] The monitors will be there and then there will be a studio for sound and some offices for our television crew.
[time=1186] Again, we're looking from the balcony down to the platform area and Rick will stand right in the center there when he preaches and then there will be an area for the organ and piano and orchestra and then the choir will be in the tiered section.
[time=1199] We are certainly looking forward to moving into that new home.
[time=1202] Pete, thanks for explaining all of those different shots and we have some dedication dates planned
[time=1208] that we hope you'll join us and be a part of the celebration.
[time=1212] That's the weekend of October 14th, 15th and 16th.
[time=1216] On the 14th we have Nielsen and Young coming as our keyboard artist and guest and then on the 15th pastor David Jeremiah, the founder and first pastor of our church will be here
[time=1227] and then on the 16th Dr. David Burnham will be here.
[time=1230] He will be for the month prior to dedication working with the Olympic Committee and Korea
[time=1237] putting chaplains with each team that comes to the Olympics and then training those athletes to go back as ambassadors for Christ to their home country.
[time=1246] So we'll have a fresh glimpse of the spiritual impact of the Olympics with Dr. Burnham here on Sunday the 16th.
[time=1253] That'll be a great weekend.
[time=1254] I'm looking forward to it, Rick.
[time=1256] Now we want to share a booklet with you for just a moment before we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1262] It has the simple one word title, "bitterness." It is a battle that each of us will face from time to time in our life and this helpful little
[time=1271] booklet gives us God's prescription of dealing with the issue of bitterness in our life and
[time=1278] how we can overcome it, learn to forgive and experience God's forgiveness as well.
[time=1283] It's been written by Jim Henry, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Orlando, Florida and Jim is a great teacher of God's Word and we want to encourage you to write for his
[time=1294] booklet today.
[time=1296] He's right to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1304] Just ask for the booklet entitled "Bitterness" and once again the address is the Bible hour,
[time=1311] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1317] Thank you, Pete and thank you for joining us today here on The Bible Hour.
[time=1326] [MUSIC - 247 seconds]
[time=1596] Thank you, you may be seated. Thank you, Dale and I am thankful that you've made that a value of your life to memorize God's Word. Some of you men may have played football and you know the importance of having the plays memorized. When they put the ball down on the line you have 30 seconds to call play, get the team to the line, hike the ball and get your play in motion. 30 seconds.
[time=1625] When you go into that huddle off the quarterback says we're going to run a right 44 dive and the half back says all right 44 dive. Man, what's that?
[time=1634] Quarterback spits out his mouthpiece and says well you get the ball and you run through the four hole, four hole, one, two, and suddenly 30 seconds are gone. You've missed that opportunity. Many of us miss opportunities in life spiritually because we haven't memorized the plays.
[time=1653] So we've made it a priority in this year to memorize God's Word and I hope you'll join us in our weekly endeavor to memorize the Scripture. It is a good spiritual habit. Now I'd like to ask you to bow and join me in another good spiritual habit, that a prayer.
[time=1672] Our God we bow before you and we thank you for your Word. I'm thankful for the direction that it gives to my life. I'm thankful for the principles that correct me. I confess I need them often.
[time=1687] And we bow before you in these moments to corporately and individually admit to you and to ourselves we are sinners and that we need you today Lord.
[time=1699] We need your forgiveness. We need to make another unearned withdrawal on your mercy. And today we ask for you to cleanse us and to make us whole.
[time=1716] We pray today that you would take this our humble attempt to praise your name and you would accept it in spite of us. Father we love you today and we now feel badly for the moments of hypocrisy.
[time=1736] The times of disobedience that have dotted this past week since we've met here together and we want to be made clean. And so we come in Jesus name and ask your forgiveness.
[time=1751] We come to give today Lord give you our worship, give your praise and we ask you to receive them. And as we study your Word today we pray that you would use it as a medicine to heal each heart.
[time=1768] For those who are suffering today because of the lost of loved ones, we ask that you would heal. Give confidence of eternal life and steadfast hope in heaven.
[time=1780] We pray for Ted Ward in the death of his mother, John Eastus in the loss of his father, David Burnham in the home growing of his mother, that you would be to these men their strength in their life.
[time=1796] We pray today for men and women who are in transition. Some are in transition with jobs, others are in transition, they're moving. They have a sense of being uprooted, displaced. Families feel the pain and we ask you to protect those roots, replant them and nourish them again soon.
[time=1822] As we study your Word today, we would want to dress ourselves and conduct ourselves in a way that would honor you. So today we ask you to teach us in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=1841] This coach had an air for flair. He never did anything simply or subtly. He had the ability to get the team's attention with every move that he made. Today he needed nothing to gain their attention.
[time=1856] Today there would be an announcement as to who made the varsity team, who made the junior varsity team and who made neither.
[time=1868] A little guy was sitting on the end of the bench and for two days he had had to practice jersey on, was to practice jersey that all the guys on the JV team wore, but he knew not all of them on the JV team would make the team.
[time=1881] He wondered what he make it this year. With the usual flair, the coach began to speak to each one of them and telling them their fate. He pointed to this one little guy and he said, "Take off your jersey, throw it in the barrel."
[time=1898] That young guy looked down at that JV jersey and knew he had just been cut from the team.
[time=1904] "Take off your jersey and throw it in the barrel." Then to a surprise the coach reached in this barrel and took a varsity jersey and threw it at him and said, "Then put this one on."
[time=1914] A new jersey, a new identification is to put it on. Colossians chapter 3, God says, "Take that jersey off, put this one on."
[time=1929] Do you have a Bible with you today? Open it to Colossians chapter 3. We're studying four principles. Last week we saw three, today we'll give you the fourth, four principles for producing Christian character.
[time=1943] The theme that you'll see again and again in Colossians 3 verses 5 through 14 is, "Take it off, put something else on."
[time=1954] Verse 5, "Put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry."
[time=1974] Because of these the wrath of God is coming. You used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived, but now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these, anger, rage, malice, slander and filthy language from your lips.
[time=2000] Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in the knowledge, in the image of its creator.
[time=2019] There is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all and is in all.
[time=2040] Therefore as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience, bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.
[time=2059] Forgive, forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[time=2074] We live in a instant society. We are used to pulling in the lines at Arby's or McDonald's or Harvey's and stopping right there and speaking in a little box, put in order, drive up to a window and right now there's the food, and we're upset if it's not there right now.
[time=2092] But our society has become so instant, we not only get our hamburgers that way, we get our bank loans that way.
[time=2099] I remember when you wanted a small loan from the bank you had to go in, sign your life away, have 45 people co-sign and have a blood test, then they might give you a loan.
[time=2109] Now today you can go through a drive up window and you can make a loan. We are that instant of a society, but in spiritual maturity there is no instant process.
[time=2124] It is painstaking, it is hard work, but it is rewarding, but it is a process that you have to go through.
[time=2135] You can come to Christ and He will instantly save you and if you haven't done that I hope you will today.
[time=2142] But if you would be spiritually mature you must be willing to pay the price of four principles.
[time=2151] Allow me to review the three from last week and then give you a new one today.
[time=2156] Principle number one is found in Colossians 3-1 you memorized it since you have been raised with Christ.
[time=2164] The first principle is that you must appropriate spiritual power.
[time=2170] You have to have Christ in your heart, you have to die to yourself and then be raised as a brand new person.
[time=2177] This is not something you can do on your own, you have to have Christ in your heart.
[time=2182] Religion cannot save you, no amount of rules keeping can save you.
[time=2187] Only Christ can do that and before you go on the principles 2-3-4 it has to be true of your life that since you have been raised with Christ.
[time=2196] The second principle is the principle of self-determination.
[time=2200] That's not that John Wayne mentality, well I can do it, you know that I'm just such a two-fisted tough guy I can hammer out my own spirituality.
[time=2210] By self-determination we're building on this phrase out of the scripture since you've been raised with Christ set your heart on things above.
[time=2222] What is it that you have set your heart towards? Do you remember the famous lines of Robert Frost?
[time=2231] Two paths diverged into a woods and I chose the one less traveled by and that is made all of the difference.
[time=2241] You will face again and again in your life crossroads where choices have to be made that God does not make for you.
[time=2252] He has not programmed you as a little robot and said, well I think I'll make Joe choose this today and I think I'll make Marianne choose that.
[time=2259] I'm going to have Steve do this and when they do that God gives us that autonomous choice and we must set our affections on the things above.
[time=2270] If we say with my life I am going to pursue and we have certain jobs, we have certain goals and these goals exclude the spiritual, we have set our course in the wrong direction.
[time=2284] We must determine within ourselves what is it we will make the delight of our life.
[time=2291] The third principle is the principle of positive thinking. This is not just a little chain chugging along saying I think I can't, I think I can't, I think I can.
[time=2302] It is the purposeful choosing of setting our minds on the right things and thinking about these and categorically not setting our mind on these things which are the wrong things.
[time=2316] Let me give you two illustrations that are completely neutral. Have you ever noticed how some people have set their mind on baseball?
[time=2324] Baseball is not my love so I'm going to pick on it this morning.
[time=2328] I know that there are two teams that play in New York, the Yankees and the Mets.
[time=2333] I can't tell you two people who play on either team but there are guys that can tell you who bats 11th in a nine man line up if two guys have the flu on the same day.
[time=2344] And he can tell you not only who would do that on the Mets tomorrow but who did it on the miracle Mets team back in '69 or whenever it was.
[time=2352] We were watching baseball yesterday and the friend said you're never going to believe who's now on a professional pitching staff.
[time=2361] Now I would recognize the names Whitey Ford, Don Drysdale, Sandy Kofax but it wasn't one of those things, I'd be in trouble.
[time=2371] The friend says Frank Funk. I said Frank Funk. That's great. Who do you ever play for?
[time=2381] On this friend he could tell you who he played for, what is ERA? He knew baseball because he had set his mind to know baseball.
[time=2389] Went to the symphony with another friend. We're sitting there enjoying the symphony. I enjoyed the symphony.
[time=2394] My friend is sitting there listening to the symphony and he says oh did you hear that old ball? Is it an old ball? What's an old ball?
[time=2404] I don't even know what an old ball is but he had set his heart on music and I mean he could hear the woodwinds and the brass and the strings and the percussion and then he could hear the old ball.
[time=2416] I was glad he could hear that old ball. Somebody made a living that day playing an old ball. I don't know music.
[time=2423] I haven't set my mind to that. That's a good thing to set your mind to music. It's a good thing to set your mind to baseball and I don't think wrong with that but have you set your mind to know the scriptures.
[time=2434] Have you said I am going to study the scriptures so that my mind is saturated with knowing what God has said so that I will have the positive influence thinking positive as God would have me to think instead of thinking like society teaches me to think.
[time=2452] Now the fourth principle. It is the principle of positive replacement. As we read verses 5 through 14 I hope you heard the repetition allusion to it saying take this off and put this on.
[time=2469] God has a prescription here that I am calling the principle positive replacement that insists upon us stopping certain activities and casting them aside and then starting some brand new ones.
[time=2486] And he uses the analogy of clothing. Let's look at what we take off and then what we put on.
[time=2494] Verse 5 says put the death therefore whatever belongs to the earthly nature. Allow me to call this first of all putting off the old taste.
[time=2508] In our life we develop an appetite for things. Remember us talking last week that after a while we can develop an appetite that we like those things that we formally dislike.
[time=2519] I learned to like pizza. I've learned to like diet soft drinks. I've learned to like running a little bit. We learn those things. Those weren't things that I originally like. I had to learn to like those.
[time=2532] In the same way we have learned to like habits that we really need to put off. The smoker learned to smoke that cigarette.
[time=2540] His body didn't accept it the first time he did it. It went through rejection but he learned to like it. Now the Bible comes and it begins to say you must put off those old appetites.
[time=2553] Those things for which you develop the taste you've got to put them aside. And then he begins to listen. They don't need great explanation. They're rather clear. They're blunt.
[time=2563] First he gives us a pair that goes together. Put off actually put to death. Therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature. Two things. Sexual immorality and impurity.
[time=2579] Two Sundays ago we gave a somewhat daring message on legalism. And we said don't make rules. All of a sudden you're saying, "Hocks you're reading a whole bunch of rules." There's a distinction.
[time=2594] Legalism is me making up my own rules as a man and measuring your spirituality if you keep my rules.
[time=2604] This is a list of God's rules. It is not legalistic to say God has said, "Thou shall and thou shall not." It's not legalism. It's the law.
[time=2620] And there's a point of clarification coming. It says it's because of these things that the wrath of God is coming. This is not an issue to be skirted.
[time=2630] The first two. Immorality and impurity. In the ancient world the body was not something that was to be controlled. It was something to be gratified.
[time=2643] We've moved through cycles of history. We are back where the ancient works. We see our body as that which is to be gratified.
[time=2651] There were the dualistic thinkers who said the body is evil. The spirit is good. And you just have to do in the spirit what God wants you to do in your body. You just do whatever you want to do.
[time=2662] And they had great philosophers. Now we just have musicians that say, "It's your thing baby. Do what you want to do." We've gone full cycle.
[time=2670] But know this. God has said, "The body is not for immorality." There are two things discouraging in our society.
[time=2681] The first is this. Statistics show that about 75% of high school graduates have already compromised their purity. 75%.
[time=2693] The second discouraging thing is the statistics are not better for Christians. We have gone the way of society. This is not legalism. This is God's standards for your life.
[time=2709] He said, "The body is not for impurity. It is not for immorality." God's a comic kills joy. He looks up on heaven and whatever looks like funny just blasts it away. No.
[time=2721] God said, "I've created sex. I've designed it. It is good. And I say it is good within marriage and you deserve your body for that life's partner."
[time=2732] Here's another list of two things. Second list is this. Lust and evil desire. They go together. Desire in itself is not bad, but desire out of control is.
[time=2748] Lust is desire without restraint. It's desire as the controlling force of our life.
[time=2759] The Bible says here that we are not to be governed by our appetites, but that we're actually to take our appetites and put them off stronger than put it off. It actually says put it to death.
[time=2773] It makes sense to put those appetites to death because we are already dead. Colossians 3-3 says, "You died with Christ."
[time=2784] So the old Rick Hawks is dead, but I can run the danger of artificially keeping its heartbeat alive by continuing to feed it, the old habits of greed, of lust and of impurity.
[time=2800] God says, "I've crucified it. It's dead. Why don't you let it die?" Instead of trying to keep pumping life back into these old habits.
[time=2810] The next thing that it gives us is the word "greed." Very simple Greek word. It's a compound of two. It is the word "more" and the word "to have."
[time=2821] And greed is the insatiable desire to have more.
[time=2826] C.S. Lewis in his Chronicles of Narnia illustrates it in this way. Little Edmond goes through a mystical wardrobe that leads into the more mystical land of Narnia. There he meets someone who can give him whatever he asks.
[time=2841] So he asks for his favorite treat, Turkish delight. And little Edmond begins to eat his Turkish delight. He opens up the box and he unwraps it and he sticks a piece in his mouth.
[time=2853] And he hasn't had that one half chewed before his little fingers are opening up the next one. You've seen little guys do that. And he hasn't got it quite swallowed and in goes number two.
[time=2862] And he's working on number three. And he gets number two and three and number four. And he begins to look like a chick-munk.
[time=2868] And old Edmond's just scarfing down that Turkish delight as fast as he can. No matter how much he has in his mouth, his hands have to be full. And he's stuffing it. And he wants more. And he wants more. And he wants more.
[time=2882] That's greed. It's the insatiable desire to have more.
[time=2888] In his senior years, J.D. Rockefeller was asked, "Mr. Rockefeller, you have more money than any person who has ever lived. What else would you like?"
[time=2898] He said, "Quite simply, just a little bit more."
[time=2905] The Bible says, "Like an old jacket, take off immorality. Like a dirty dress, throw aside impurity.
[time=2915] Like something that should never be worn again, cast away. Greed and lust. Put it to death. Burn it. Destroy it."
[time=2927] These used to be a part of your life. That's good news. Did you notice that?
[time=2933] Verse seven, "These used to be the manner in which you walked and how you lived."
[time=2939] You say, "Why is that good news?" Because that tells me there can be a change in character.
[time=2944] He's not addressing a group of people and saying, "Okay, now you have been sweet little Sunday school girls and boys all of your life, and you've never done any of these things.
[time=2953] Now stay on the right track." You say, "Oh no. Even you and you and you who've walked down this path, you who've lived this way, you can put it off."
[time=2962] You can have a brand new life in Christ. Just put it off. Put off those old tastes.
[time=2971] Second thing he says, then verse eight, "Get rid of, put off that old temper."
[time=2978] Verse eight, "Now you must rid yourselves as such things as these. Anger and rage, malice and slander and filthy language from your lips."
[time=2990] I've lumped these all together as temper. I know some of them are words like slander and filthy words, but I really believe what he's picturing.
[time=3000] He's picturing that temper that's out of control. He uses the word anger. Anger here is a word that means that slowly developed hatred.
[time=3011] It's that mind that remembers and stores it. Then it remembers this, files it. Then it takes this one, data entry.
[time=3020] And then all of a sudden you discover they're angry, and you say, "Why am I upset?" Well, 1952, and they start reading you the list. They've remembered it. It's a slow building anger. He says, "Get rid of that. Throw that away."
[time=3035] He says, "Get rid of rage. Rage is anger, but it's not the slow building. It's the brush fire that you drop a spark, boom, explosive personality."
[time=3044] God never justifies the mentality. He says, "Well, I've just got to let it out." You know what happens? If you learn to let it out, you know what you'll do? You'll keep letting it out.
[time=3054] And if you say, "The only way I can deal with my anger is I have to let it out. If I just blow off steam, I'll be okay."
[time=3061] You blow off steam. Next time you're angry, you blow off steam, and suddenly you learn, "You know what happens in life? I get angry, I blow off steam."
[time=3069] And it becomes a cyclical problem. He says, "Get rid of it. Get rid of malice." That's the hatred on the inside.
[time=3077] That's the mind that contemplates evil, that wishes harm, that manipulates how I can get what I want and put you down.
[time=3087] Slander. It's one, "Our temper is out of control, and we use our words to vent our anger, and we falsely accuse and denounce others."
[time=3097] It's actually the word blaspheme, and then obscene language.
[time=3101] It's that temper that can not only denounce what has to curse and bring in filthy language to stress its point.
[time=3108] God says, "Take it off. Throw it over here."
[time=3114] Third time he tells us to take something off, verse 9, he says, "Do not lie to each other. Put off the old taste. Put off the old temper. Put off the old tongue."
[time=3130] You see, to these Greeks of that day, truth was not as important as tongue.
[time=3139] You see, it's not what you said that counted, but how well you could say it.
[time=3144] And so the great orator was not the person who could defend the truth.
[time=3148] Anybody could defend the truth, but the great orator is the one who could make you believe the lie.
[time=3154] And so telling the truth was not all that important. It was important that your tongue was gifted, that it was gilded,
[time=3161] that it could say things that would impress people.
[time=3165] Now God turns it around, and he says, "No truth is the value." So take that old tongue, and put it off.
[time=3174] Do not lie to each other. Why?
[time=3177] Here's his first sense of reasoning. "Since you have taken off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self."
[time=3187] He says, "You came to Christ. You're a new man. You said you wanted spiritual maturity, then you've got to take off all of these things.
[time=3195] You've got to take off those old tastes and appetites. You've got to take off that old temper. You've got to take off that old tongue.
[time=3200] Because you said, "I am a new man in Christ." And the new man is going through the process of being renewed.
[time=3209] Look closely at verse 10, and have put on the new self, which is being renewed.
[time=3216] I want to emphasize the verb tense with you for a moment.
[time=3220] It's not stated here, since he has been made new as though it's all done and settled.
[time=3226] Once you come to Christ, spiritual maturity is a constant process of being renewed again and again.
[time=3233] How can you be renewed again and again?
[time=3236] You're renewed in knowledge. Knowledge of what? Knowledge of the image.
[time=3241] Why would he use the word image? Because my life as a new man is to be made into the image of Christ.
[time=3252] And so I constantly have to go to the word of God to increase my knowledge so I get a sharper focus on the image of my creator,
[time=3260] so I can be made new like him again and again.
[time=3265] It's a process that never ends, but always can get better and better.
[time=3274] Then he says, "Here there is no Greek or Jew. Those were mutually exclusive groups based upon ethnic convictions and background.
[time=3284] There is neither circumcised or uncircumcised. That is a distinction based upon religion.
[time=3290] There is neither barbarian or Scythian. That's a distinction based upon culture.
[time=3296] There was only one thing lower than a barbarian, a Scythian.
[time=3301] And there is another distinction between slave or free that has everything to do with social status.
[time=3309] We might put it this way today. In Jesus Christ, there is no distinction between Americans and Libyans.
[time=3320] In America today, there are no distinction between those who are conservative on religious issues versus those who are progressive.
[time=3330] In Christianity today, there is no distinction between those of us who like to hear the orchestra and those of us who love the harmonica.
[time=3340] There is no distinction between those of us who choose to attend church three times a week versus those who may choose to attend twice a week.
[time=3350] There is no distinction between those who traditionally vote Republican and those who traditionally vote Democratic.
[time=3359] There is no distinction between those who grew up in one part of our culture where everybody does it and those of us who grew up in another part of our culture where nobody does it.
[time=3372] We love each other.
[time=3374] And we put on verse 12, "Therefore as God's chosen, holy, dearly loved, clothed yourself, and He gives us a new list."
[time=3385] But before we get into the list, let me tell you first how He describes us.
[time=3391] Some of you guys will remember this. Maybe the girls have had this experience too.
[time=3396] In our neighborhood, we played a lot of football and a lot of basketball.
[time=3400] A lot of guys had a little hoop in their drive when you played there, but on Saturday, you went to Lions Park.
[time=3406] And on Saturday morning, about nine o'clock at Lions Park, there would be a big game and the big guys would play.
[time=3413] Those of us who are the little guys like to occasionally play with the big guys.
[time=3417] When you got to Lions Park at nine o'clock, the two biggest guys picked up teams.
[time=3422] They picked up teams because they said they were going to and the rest of us said, "That'll be fine." I can remember that experience. Big court.
[time=3431] We're going to play. Two big guys walk up.
[time=3435] They decide they're going to pick teams. The big guy always got to pick first.
[time=3438] So they said, "I'll take that guy and he'd come over and he'd stand behind this big guy." All the rest of us are over there.
[time=3444] And then the other big guy said, "I'll take him and I'll get third pick too and I'll take him." Those two guys that come over there, I remember standing on that line saying, "I wonder if they'll pick me.
[time=3454] I wonder if I'll get to play today." They'd pick another and another.
[time=3460] You'd look and there were three guys on this team, there were three guys on this team and there were five guys waiting to be picked and only four of them were going to be picked.
[time=3469] You'd stand there and hope that you're going to be picked.
[time=3472] Well, I remember I'd stand like this. I'd try to make myself look tall.
[time=3476] Why, they're picking. I'd try to dribble the ball through my legs.
[time=3479] Maybe they think he's quick.
[time=3481] But they picked me.
[time=3484] I mean, do you remember the day you got picked?
[time=3486] But you can also remember the day you didn't get picked.
[time=3490] You know what Jesus Christ says? "I choose you, Chris.
[time=3494] I love you, Marie. I choose you, Elmer.
[time=3498] I want you, Becky, and we are God's dearly beloved.
[time=3504] He's chosen you."
[time=3511] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and soloist Joni King.
[time=3523] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3526] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3531] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3534] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3537] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that I could know now that I can live a positive life for you.
[time=3545] And I know that there are sin in my life.
[time=3548] And I ask you to come in today and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse my heart.
[time=3554] Give me a new life in Jesus Christ.
[time=3557] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
