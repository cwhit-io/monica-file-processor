[time=112] The Great Chicago Fire had just been quenched.
[time=115] And H.G. Spafford sent his wife and four daughters shipped to England, there to enjoy the season while the city was rebuilding.
[time=124] In route, the ship encountered a raging storm at sea.
[time=129] The four girls were drowned.
[time=131] The mother telegram from England, two words.
[time=135] Saved alone.
[time=138] Spafford took the next ship to England to join his bereaved wife.
[time=142] As he crossed those raging waters himself, he peered down into the darkness that had swallowed up his four little girls, and he penned these words.
[time=153] When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, are when sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say.
[time=167] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=173] (bell ringing)
[time=185] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=189] Thank you for joining us.
[time=190] Rick is continuing his series from the book of Colossians with a message he has entitled, "Sailing in the Rough Times." Each of us must sail through the rough seas of life.
[time=201] Death, broken relationships, misunderstandings, discouragement are all inevitable.
[time=206] None of us can avoid the rough times, but we can be prepared for them.
[time=210] Colossians 3 provides timeless insight for facing those unavoidable turbulent times.
[time=216] We invite you to join us today for our study titled, "Sailing in the Rough Times." We encourage you to open your Bible to the book of Colossians chapter 3 verses 15 through 17.
[time=228] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=234] Other special music includes a solo from Susan Toyrak, as well as a duet from Rick Stump and Susan Toyrak.
[time=245] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=254] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=259] Now, here's Rick.
[time=261] You've come to worship with us today.
[time=263] We welcome you to our second morning worship service.
[time=267] We also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=272] As we meet today, our purpose is to praise God.
[time=275] And out of that heart of praise, there comes a blessing to our own lives.
[time=279] That as we praise His name, we get lifted up.
[time=283] Today would be a good Sunday to make it a mission's emphasis.
[time=286] It's not particularly a mission's emphasis, although it's always a part of our commitment.
[time=291] But our choir is going to sing a very Hebrew song for us called "He Is Jehovah." Jehovah is a name forgotten in the Old Testament that speaks of the greatness of the one who always was.
[time=304] Before Abraham was, Jesus said, "I am." The great I am is Jehovah, and He is Jehovah.
[time=314] [MUSIC] He is Jehovah, God of creation [MUSIC] He is Jehovah, God of mighty [MUSIC] The Father here, the Rock of Ages [MUSIC] He is Jehovah, God that He left me â™ª
[time=343] He is the great I am, the God of Abraham, the Holy Shavon, the God of Visaya, the God of Israel. He everlasting one. He is Jehovah, the God let you with me.
[time=362] Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah. He is Jehovah, the God of my God. He is Jehovah, the God let you with me.
[time=388] He is the great I am, the God of my God, the God of my God, the God of my God. He is the great I am, the God that let you with me.
[time=407] Sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah. He is Jehovah, the God of my God. He is Jehovah, the God that let you with me.
[time=449] Jehovah, the God that let you with me, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah, sing hallelujah.
[time=470] I'm sure that you've been listening to the messages from Rick and mentioned the difficulties and even the booklet that we're offering on television speaks of bitterness and the strife that we have in this world.
[time=483] And Jehovah, God, is the one that can heal all of those needs. Another song that goes along with our theme today is "It is Well with My Soul," him number 417.
[time=494] Let's join together in singing the first, third, and fourth stanzas of 417. I'd like to request, please, that the ladies sing the third stanza when we get to it and men will join in on the reframe.
[time=513] [MUSIC - 186 seconds]
[time=707] Such a great amount of confidence and peace in that song, talking about the strength that God can give us at the time of great trial and circumstance.
[time=718] Rick talked about us going to Israel with the choir number. We're going to go south of the border now. It is amazing that there are a number of churches today that are singing multitude of styles of music today because of their own particular locale in this world.
[time=735] We're bringing a little bit to Fort Wayne here in Black Hawk Church as we listen to Susan now with this southern style, but listen to the message as she sings for us.
[time=746] [MUSIC - 444 seconds]
[time=1215] As Rick has said, these books are very helpful, and we'd like to have you request one today by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1237] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today here on the Bible Hour.
[time=1242] [MUSIC - 238 seconds]
[time=1504] Thank you, Rick and Susan. I would like to invite you to bow with me that we might pray together. Our God and our Father, we worship you today. We thank you for the song that speaks that your name is holy, that you're the Lord of Glory. And we bow down before you. And first of all, confess to you our sin, both corporately and individually.
[time=1531] We ask you to wash us and to make us clean. We admit to you that this past week has been punctuated with harsh events of disservice to your name. And we seek your forgiveness. And we do today pledge ourselves to walk in a way worthy of your name that we might not disgrace you, but we might honor you in every way.
[time=1560] And as we open up your word today, we would ask you to teach us, teach us how we might navigate through the difficult times as well as the tranquil times. Pray today that your word would give refreshment to weary souls. We pray for those who are battling cancer, for Dave Galway's sister, for Julie Brookholder. We thank you for the strength and recovery that Harry Bennett's experienced.
[time=1587] Pray today that you'll strengthen Mike Ballis's body and give him recovery while he's here with us. Pray that you'll give doctors wisdom to diagnose his needs. Pray that your hand would be upon his mother as well.
[time=1601] We pray today that your word would be an oasis to those who are in a drought spiritually. To those who have grown bored or apathetic, we ask you to revive us today.
[time=1613] In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1617] The flames of the great Chicago fire had just been quenched. The Windy City was in ruins.
[time=1627] And a man of means by the name of Spafford sent his wife and four daughters by way of trained to New York to catch a ship to carry them off to England, a vacation away from it all.
[time=1643] The train departed on time. They caught their ship and they were making their way to England.
[time=1649] A storm blew up at sea and the ship was capsized. Most of the crew and the ship's passengers were lost.
[time=1659] Spafford in Chicago received a two-word telegram from his wife. It said, "Saved alone."
[time=1669] Their four precious daughters were drowned in the sea. Immediately, Spafford made plans to join his wife in England. He took the same train, went to New York, caught a ship to England.
[time=1683] On his voyage across the Atlantic, he asked the captain if the captain would awaken him in the night at that point in the ocean where his four little girls had drowned.
[time=1695] Spafford went to bed, honoring his request the captain awakened him at night. Spafford went alone to the side of the ship and peered down through the darkness of night.
[time=1707] He could hear the water as it would splash against the side of his ship. He could feel it's salt he missed as it sprayed up in his face.
[time=1715] His mind would cotton plate four little girls that he would never see again.
[time=1721] He took out of his back pocket, an envelope, one that he could use, and then from this pocket a pen, and he wrote these words.
[time=1734] "When peace like a river, attendeth my way, or when sorrows like sea billows roll, thou hast taught me to say, 'Whatever my lot, it is well, it is well with my soul.'"
[time=1756] We sang that hymn this morning. It wasn't a piece of poetry that a man's penned in a beautiful countryside looking out over a golden meadow with his children romping across the field.
[time=1770] It was that which came out of a man's heart as he faced the death of four little girls.
[time=1775] What is it that would give us the ability to navigate to sail through the tough times of life?
[time=1781] Do you have a copy of the Scriptures with you today? Would you open to Colossians chapter 3 and verse 15?
[time=1788] Here God gives us insight for sailing through the tough times.
[time=1793] Colossians chapter 3 verses 15 through 17 give us the parameters of our study today.
[time=1802] It reads like this, "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, senses members of one body you were called to peace."
[time=1817] And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom.
[time=1830] And as you sing songs, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.
[time=1840] And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
[time=1854] It's inevitable in life that we will all pass not only through the tranquil seas, but through its raging waters as well.
[time=1864] What is it that gives us our balance when the sea would capsize us?
[time=1870] What is it that gives us our direction when the winds of time would blow us off course?
[time=1877] What is it that would give us power the surge ahead when the currents would turn us back?
[time=1885] Out of this passage I believe God gives us three insights for sailing through the rough times.
[time=1892] First of all, I would suggest to you that we must learn to sail being balanced by peace and gratitude.
[time=1902] Peace and gratitude.
[time=1904] Verse 15, "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, senses members of one body you were called to peace."
[time=1913] A sailor, I'm not. All three of my voyages have ended in something less than a successful adventure.
[time=1924] I remember getting in a little boat with Craig Pearson.
[time=1928] We were up on Lake Michigan and we hopped in this little boat about waist-deep in the water.
[time=1933] And the first thing he said is, "Don't sit there!" I didn't catch his admonition quite quickly and when both of us sat on the same side of the boat we were out of balance
[time=1943] and we enjoyed the 65 degree water of Lake Michigan immediately.
[time=1948] A small boat is one that is tipped easily. Balance is essential.
[time=1954] To balance our lives we need peace and gratitude.
[time=1958] Peace is described here in three ways.
[time=1961] First of all, it is a downward peace. It is the peace of Christ.
[time=1967] It's a peace that originates and God Himself and it comes down to us.
[time=1972] Denny McLean said this, "Washington is filled with peace monuments.
[time=1979] We've built one after every war." Jesus said, "I give you peace, not as the world gives, a peace that cannot be taken away."
[time=1990] We first of all have peace because it comes down from God to us.
[time=1997] Paul called it a peace with God that in our relationship with God there is no peace.
[time=2004] Whether we have angrily shaken our fist at God and said, "God, I don't believe in you."
[time=2011] Or, "God, if you're real, I don't love you." Because of what's happened in my life over rebellion.
[time=2018] Or whether we've been more passive like the road.
[time=2022] Who was asked if he had made peace with God responded by saying, "I didn't know that we had ever quarreled." Whether we are actively or passively ignoring God.
[time=2034] There is a desperate need to have peace with God.
[time=2038] Our soul is restless until we find our peace with Him.
[time=2044] And here the Bible tells us that Christ has a peace.
[time=2048] A peace of Christ that comes down from God to us.
[time=2052] Have you experienced peace with God?
[time=2055] Have you made your peace with God?
[time=2058] Or are you still trying to be the captain of your own soul?
[time=2063] The one who charts your own destiny?
[time=2066] Or are you, like Thoreau, passively simply ignoring God?
[time=2071] Hoping he won't intrude on your life.
[time=2075] Or have you come to surrender to Him and made peace with God?
[time=2081] This peace that is first of all downward is secondly inward.
[time=2086] It is a peace of God that rules in our heart.
[time=2091] The word rule is actually an athletic term that speaks of a referee or an umpire.
[time=2096] Whose job it is is to get between the two teams
[time=2102] and to keep things at peace.
[time=2105] In spite of Billy Martin, that umpire has a job.
[time=2109] To keep the game under control.
[time=2113] To keep tempers in balance.
[time=2116] Here the Bible says, "Let the peace of God rule, umpire your life.
[time=2123] In your heart, let it take control and put everything in perspective."
[time=2129] It becomes an antidote for bitterness.
[time=2133] It becomes a medicine for anger.
[time=2136] It becomes a motivation for discontent.
[time=2140] It umpires our feelings.
[time=2143] It tempers our temper.
[time=2146] It is an inward peace.
[time=2149] It's a peace that Paul described this way in Philippians chapter 4.
[time=2154] A peace of God that surpasses understanding.
[time=2160] It's a peace that we hold in spite of the circumstances.
[time=2164] It takes no character to have peace in tranquility.
[time=2169] But to have peace in conflict takes great resource.
[time=2173] It takes a peace of God that surpasses understanding.
[time=2178] It's inward.
[time=2180] And then finally, that downward inward peace is expressed outward.
[time=2186] Let the peace of Christ ruin your hearts since as members of one body we were called the peace.
[time=2196] After we have an inward peace, now we're in position to have peace outwardly.
[time=2201] But you know it's true that a man who can't live with himself can't live with anybody else either.
[time=2210] Have you gone through a series of broken relationships in your life?
[time=2214] Could it be that that lack of peace in your relationships is a reflection of the lack of peace in your heart?
[time=2221] Have you gone through a series of loss of jobs?
[time=2226] Could it be that the lack of peace in your employment is because of a lack of peace in your heart?
[time=2234] Do you know that some of the conflicts of this entire globe have because they've been because of the lack of peace in one man's heart?
[time=2245] Napoleon Bonaparte was a man driven on the inside.
[time=2251] He was a man at turmoil within his own heart, and he was obsessed with power.
[time=2256] And nothing could quench that obsession until world conquest for Napoleon was his only ambition.
[time=2267] He stood on the eve of an invasion of Russia.
[time=2270] He boasted of his plans, and the advisor says, "Remember man proposes, but it is God who disposes."
[time=2278] And Napoleon angrily retorted, "Napoleon proposes, and Napoleon disposes."
[time=2285] And he attacked Russia because there was no peace in his own heart.
[time=2290] laid off Hitler as a man equally obsessed with himself.
[time=2295] No peace within until it exploded into a world war.
[time=2299] And a cut was destroyed because there was no peace within.
[time=2305] So there could be no peace demonstrated on the out word expression to others.
[time=2311] And we face the tough times, requires balance.
[time=2318] It is inevitable that we will lose loved ones.
[time=2321] It is certain that we will lose in a relationship that we will be misunderstood, falsely accused.
[time=2330] Our good spoken evil of, some of us will bury our spouses, some of us are children.
[time=2339] The tough times are certain.
[time=2341] What gives balance?
[time=2343] How do we relate?
[time=2345] God says, "I'll give a peace that surpasses understanding." It comes from me.
[time=2352] It lives in you, and it's given outwardly.
[time=2356] Along with that balance of peace, there's the balance of gratitude.
[time=2362] In verse 16, three little words, "And be thankful." I am not an English teacher, but allow me to dabble in grammar.
[time=2372] As we look at these simple words, note something of the mood.
[time=2376] First of all, this is called the imperative mood.
[time=2379] It is a command.
[time=2380] Here God says, "Be thankful," He doesn't suggest it as a positive benefit.
[time=2386] It's not given as an optional insight.
[time=2388] It is a command, "Be thankful." Secondly, note that it's intransitive.
[time=2394] That means it has no object.
[time=2396] It doesn't demand one.
[time=2398] It doesn't say, "Be thankful for your spouse." Be thankful for your children.
[time=2403] Be thankful for your boss.
[time=2405] It just says, "Be thankful." It is a categorical response to everything in life.
[time=2414] It is not something that is thankful for what is good.
[time=2418] It is simply a position in life.
[time=2421] I am thankful.
[time=2425] We celebrate Thanksgiving.
[time=2427] It's that holiday set aside by the pilgrims.
[time=2432] They didn't give thanks for this long linen covered table with a plump turkey in the middle,
[time=2438] and every type of vegetable on this side, and every type of salad on this side, and then too many desserts at that end.
[time=2446] They gave thanks to God for, although half of them died.
[time=2450] They were thankful that half of them lived.
[time=2452] Although Governor Carver had died in that first winter, Governor Bradford was a godly man, and they gave thanks for that.
[time=2460] They didn't give thanks out of their good circumstances.
[time=2463] They weren't grateful for their abundance.
[time=2465] They were simply grateful and thankful to a god that would allow half of them to survive one winter.
[time=2472] They had not seen the ship come with supplies.
[time=2475] They were thankful that an Indian taught them how to grow this new substance called corn.
[time=2481] They were thankful that they found out if they caught fish, and they buried the fish where they planted the corn, it would grow better.
[time=2489] They were thankful.
[time=2491] Gratitude.
[time=2493] My first response is thankful, but you don't know my circumstances.
[time=2497] Do you know Paul's?
[time=2499] Do you know this man who said be thankful?
[time=2501] You know where he wrote Colossians from?
[time=2503] Top floor of the height.
[time=2507] He wrote it from a Roman prison.
[time=2511] He was under the sentence of death.
[time=2513] He had appealed the Caesar the Supreme Court of its day.
[time=2516] This courtroom debate would not be Matt Locke or Perry Mason.
[time=2521] It would not be one of great appeal and equal time for the defense.
[time=2524] It would be the whim of an emperor who would say you live or you die.
[time=2531] That's Paul's circumstances.
[time=2534] And in this epistle seven times he says thankful, gratitude, abounding and thanksgiving.
[time=2541] It's what gives life, it's balance.
[time=2544] There's an old hymn we sang as children.
[time=2546] We do good, deliver as adults.
[time=2548] Count your many blessings, name them one by one.
[time=2553] Count your many blessings and see what God has done.
[time=2558] I don't know whether it's a total human orientation or whether it's just our culture, but we are problem oriented.
[time=2566] We walk into a situation and our assessment is what's wrong here and how can it be right?
[time=2573] We need to change our perspective and enter the situation and say, what's good here that I can give thanks for?
[time=2583] Principle number two is this one.
[time=2586] Not only are we balanced with peace and with gratitude, but we are guided by the word of Christ.
[time=2595] I mentioned my ceiling experience is limited.
[time=2598] My first was as an eighth grader.
[time=2600] My friend across the street's father had bought a new sailboat.
[time=2603] He had put it in, put in base and dusky.
[time=2606] He took us up the day before we were to go sailing and we too brave men as eighth graders slipped overnight on board that sailboat.
[time=2614] And we sailed the high seas that night.
[time=2617] I mean the boat was anchored, but we did everything to that boat you could do.
[time=2621] We raised the sail and we hoisted the Jolly Roger and we dropped the sail and we swung the boom
[time=2627] and we loved playing with the rudder.
[time=2629] We took this long handle and we'd stand up and we'd turn it and turn it.
[time=2633] You could just see the water spinning around.
[time=2636] Dad didn't know we'd done any of this and we'd put the rudder right back in its place.
[time=2640] We got out, middle put in bay, sail goes up, jib sheets full.
[time=2648] He grabs the rudder and turns and nothing happens.
[time=2651] We'd spun it around and locked it backwards.
[time=2656] We had no direction.
[time=2658] A lot of wind, a lot of power, but no direction.
[time=2664] What is it that gives life its direction when you're navigating the tough seas?
[time=2669] Verse 17, 16, excuse me.
[time=2673] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.
[time=2677] As you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom and as you sing,
[time=2683] He psalms hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.
[time=2690] Let the word of God dwell in you richly.
[time=2695] We will need to do two things to achieve that goal.
[time=2699] First of all, you've got to be in the Word.
[time=2702] You cannot simply come to church, allow a message like mine to echo in your ears for 30 minutes
[time=2710] and have the word of God dwell in you richly.
[time=2713] You have to be in the Word.
[time=2716] On your own, studying God's Word daily is at your habit.
[time=2722] You need to be memorizing Scripture is at your habit.
[time=2726] You need to be taking Scripture and applying it to the context of your life.
[time=2730] We call that meditation is at your habit.
[time=2734] But it is not enough that you get into the Word.
[time=2738] Secondly, you have to let the Word get in to you.
[time=2744] The only analogy I could think of this week was that of medicine.
[time=2748] If you're a doctor today and you work in medicine and you yourself become ill,
[time=2755] it matters not how many medical degrees you have and how much medicine you work in,
[time=2762] the medicine has got to get in you.
[time=2765] It's not enough that you're in it.
[time=2768] And God's Word has to get in you.
[time=2773] I know too many of us that know what the Word says, but it's all out here.
[time=2778] And it's not in here.
[time=2781] The Word says let God's Word dwell in you.
[time=2786] To dwell in means to live in, to make yourself at home, to take over.
[time=2792] If you went through our house, you could walk from room to room, and by the things that are there, you could tell who occupies that space.
[time=2800] If you go up into Adam's room, he's got these three little baskets.
[time=2803] The first one has strange men in it.
[time=2806] Superman, Aquaman, Fireman, Green Hornet, Batman.
[time=2810] They're all in there.
[time=2812] The next one is cars, big cars, little cars, small cars, mini cars, micro cars.
[time=2818] That's Adam's room.
[time=2820] You go across the hall and you can see Rachel in Rebecca's room.
[time=2824] They have baby dolls, they're done in pink, and they have lacy curtains, and everything has fluff pillows.
[time=2830] Those are little girls' rooms.
[time=2832] You come downstairs in the living room.
[time=2834] You discover whose room that living room is.
[time=2836] On this wall, there's a piano.
[time=2838] Next to the piano, there's a music stand, shaped like a G-clap.
[time=2842] Next to it, there's a stack of sheet music.
[time=2844] And next to it, there's a little boom box with all kinds of cassette tapes.
[time=2848] That's Kathy's room. I was in that room once.
[time=2851] [laughter] You move out into the garage. You know what's in our garage?
[time=2856] You'll come in.
[time=2857] Here's a pair of jogging shoes.
[time=2862] Here's an old, worn out pair of jogging shoes.
[time=2864] I can't depart with those things. They're friends.
[time=2867] Here's some woodworking tools for different kinds of saws.
[time=2872] Over here's a tennis racket, two sets of golf clubs, a 10-speed bike.
[time=2876] Guess who lives in the garage in our house?
[time=2880] But you know as you go from room to room, you see the personality of the person who dwells there.
[time=2886] What personality dwells in your heart?
[time=2889] You see, if the word of God dwells in our heart, we then begin to take on the personality of our Savior.
[time=2896] Our temper becomes more like His temper.
[time=2898] Our tongue becomes more like His words.
[time=2900] Our attitudes are copied after Him because He dwells there.
[time=2904] Our heart begins to be shaped like His personality and not our own.
[time=2908] It says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly."
[time=2914] Then that which dwells in us richly springs out.
[time=2917] It gives us three participles here.
[time=2920] As you teach, as you admonish, as you sing,
[time=2927] what is in our heart eventually comes out.
[time=2930] Jesus said it's not what goes into a man that defiles him.
[time=2933] But what comes out?
[time=2935] What comes out of our life?
[time=2937] The abundance of our heart and if Christ's word is in there, then it comes out as we teach each other formally or informally.
[time=2944] As we admonish, what does admonish mean?
[time=2947] It can mean a corrective rebuke or it can be a positive directing.
[time=2952] And as we sing, as our heart expresses those emotions that comes out in music,
[time=2958] comes out in Psalms, those Old Testament phrases of God's Word that have been put to music, hymns, that which is sung.
[time=2967] Spiritual songs, every kind of music, it comes out.
[time=2971] Can I give you four little side issue principles here?
[time=2975] For those who would sing and for those who would speak.
[time=2980] Four little side issues, the direct are speaking and are singing.
[time=2987] Our music and our message.
[time=2990] Principle number one is this.
[time=2992] It should be Christ centered.
[time=2996] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.
[time=3000] Now this is my own little hobby horse and you don't have to buy it.
[time=3003] It's just mine.
[time=3005] But I don't really get excited about Christian songs that always talk about he.
[time=3012] I've never mentioned the name of Jesus, just he, him.
[time=3017] But you know it's at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow.
[time=3021] And it's at the name of Jesus, every tongue shall confess to the glory of God that he is Lord.
[time=3028] And I love it when a song magnifies the name of Jesus.
[time=3034] Have you ever studied the hymns that came out of the Reformation?
[time=3039] Well, there was an unenciant declaration of the name of Jesus and of the majesty of God.
[time=3044] Have you ever listened to the words of Luther's a mighty fortress is our God?
[time=3049] A mighty fortress is our God.
[time=3052] A bulwark never failing.
[time=3054] That's Psalm 46.
[time=3055] Put the music.
[time=3056] It speaks of God in this character.
[time=3059] But the second stands up.
[time=3061] If we in our own strength can find, our striving would be losing.
[time=3066] If not the right man, we're on our side.
[time=3069] A man of God's own choosing.
[time=3071] Does ask who that may be?
[time=3073] Christ Jesus.
[time=3075] It is he.
[time=3077] Lord Sabeoth his name.
[time=3079] From age to age the same.
[time=3082] And he shall win the battle.
[time=3085] That is music that is Christ-centered.
[time=3091] Teaching needs to be Christ-centered.
[time=3095] It's not enough that we give psychological advice or that we give relational insight.
[time=3102] There has to be that which gives its reference in Jesus Christ.
[time=3107] He is the theme of the ages.
[time=3110] And while we may want to teach relationships and we may want to counsel from the pulpit,
[time=3116] the greatest counsel that we can give is this, Jesus loves me.
[time=3120] This I know, for the Bible tells me so.
[time=3125] Our music and our message are singing and are speaking.
[time=3130] First of all, it needs to be Christ-centered.
[time=3134] Secondly, it needs to be deep.
[time=3137] It says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly." Ice cream that is rich has a lot of butter fat.
[time=3145] Cake that is rich has a lot of sugar.
[time=3149] People that are rich financially have a lot of money.
[time=3154] And music and teaching that is rich has a lot of God's word.
[time=3162] We've gone the way of country music.
[time=3164] Don't worry about what it says as long as it makes you cry and it rhymes.
[time=3169] My ears are filled with tears from lying flat on my back crying over you.
[time=3175] I mean, that's deep stuff.
[time=3178] One day I'm driving home, I'm listening to Christian radio station.
[time=3182] No one's home or else I go to our neighbor's house.
[time=3184] They're laughing and I'm laughing.
[time=3186] You know why?
[time=3187] We're listening to the same Christian song on the radio.
[time=3189] Here's what it says.
[time=3190] "Jesus, I was going to call you on the line, but I reached in my pocket and I didn't have a dime." You know what that rhymes?
[time=3197] It doesn't say anything.
[time=3199] Forgive me.
[time=3200] I don't mean to be picking on somebody who wrote that song and I know their mother loved it.
[time=3203] But I have to tell you.
[time=3206] When we sing and when we speak, there has to be a depth of God's word.
[time=3213] You don't need a dime to call Jesus.
[time=3218] And we don't need Christianity, but it's a trite little jingle.
[time=3222] We need something that is deep in God's word.
[time=3226] And we don't need messages that only appeal because they never mention words like sin
[time=3235] and salvation and hell.
[time=3238] You know there's one popular religious broadcast.
[time=3241] We invited a Christian college choir to come sing.
[time=3243] They said we'd like to sing.
[time=3245] Amazing grace.
[time=3246] They said you can't sing that on our television show because we never mention sin or anything that's not positive.
[time=3253] It's not depth.
[time=3256] A ministry that sings or teaches has to have depth.
[time=3261] Thirdly, it has to be instructive.
[time=3265] It says let us sing, let us teach with all wisdom.
[time=3269] I don't know that this has happened to you, but it happens to me.
[time=3272] I hear a message.
[time=3274] And at the end of that message, I said, wow, that was great.
[time=3277] I go home and I said, I heard this message on the right.
[time=3279] It was great.
[time=3280] What do you say?
[time=3281] I don't know.
[time=3282] We're all so great about it.
[time=3283] Well, when he told that story about the dog, I couldn't help but cry.
[time=3286] And when he told the one about the bunny rabbit, I couldn't help but laugh.
[time=3289] And suddenly, I discovered there was no instruction there.
[time=3292] What I liked was the entertainment.
[time=3294] How do we measure ministry today?
[time=3297] Do we measure it on its instruction or its entertainment?
[time=3303] Does it edify or simply help the hour to go by quickly?
[time=3308] Fourth one I would give you is worshipful.
[time=3311] It says let all this be done with gratitude.
[time=3315] That is, thanksgiving and praise harnessed together.
[time=3319] Let it be done with gratitude to God in our hearts.
[time=3325] Do we praise God?
[time=3327] A good question at the end of it all is who got the glory?
[time=3332] At the end of the song did they say, wow, what a voice.
[time=3338] Or did they say, wow, what a God that's been declared.
[time=3342] At the end of the message they say, oh, he's good.
[time=3346] Or did they say, oh, God is good.
[time=3350] Who gets the glory?
[time=3352] You know, occasionally people come to me and say, I don't think we should clap in our church because that's just glorifying the performer when they sing.
[time=3359] I think you may misunderstand us.
[time=3362] You see, when God is magnified, there comes a desire in our heart to somehow express our agreement.
[time=3368] And we all can't sing, but we want to express that.
[time=3372] Now, if we were with our Pentecostal friends, they'd express it this way.
[time=3376] They'd stand up.
[time=3377] They'd shout hallelujah and they'd yell amen.
[time=3380] If we were with our Presbyterian friends, they'd sit very stoically and they'd go, hmm.
[time=3386] You know, just a slight bob of the head of approval.
[time=3389] Now, we're kind of in the middle.
[time=3392] We're not quite that expressive.
[time=3394] We're not quite that stoic and so we're not real comfortable shouting or even saying amen most of it.
[time=3400] But we clap.
[time=3401] That's very sophisticated.
[time=3402] Yet we don't feel like we're stoic and just go, hmm.
[time=3406] That's kind of our way of saying, I agree.
[time=3409] Now, if you want to clap in our church, I hope you clap because you're saying, I agree and I want to join in the celebration of praising God.
[time=3417] If it's simply to clap for the performer, I hope you'll never do that.
[time=3422] Ministry of music, we have a message.
[time=3426] Principles to live by.
[time=3427] Well, back to our main insights.
[time=3429] The third and final one is this.
[time=3431] Whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, the principle is this one.
[time=3441] Be motivated by the glory of God.
[time=3445] You see, the name of God is an issue here.
[time=3448] A name represents two things, one identification to authority.
[time=3453] Whenever we do something and we are believers in Christ, Christ's name is identified with it.
[time=3460] Whatever you do in this community, if you are a part of this church, we are identified with it.
[time=3467] Whatever we do for the Lord Jesus Christ is giving us His name to be our authority.
[time=3473] A bill is not the authority of the land until the president puts his name on it.
[time=3478] Jesus said, you can pray in my name and I will give you my authority.
[time=3483] And with my authority comes my identification.
[time=3487] If your name is short today, one of your ancestors was short, so they called your family short.
[time=3492] If your name is Johnson today, one of your father's father's father's was John, and they called him John's son.
[time=3499] And if your name is Christian today, you have the identification of Christ.
[time=3504] It's been a delight to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir,
[time=3524] soloist Susan Toyrak, and the duet by Susan and Rick Stump.
[time=3528] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3531] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to pray this prayer with you today. Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=3540] Dear Heavenly Father, today I recognize that I'm a sinner, and I'm lost without you,
[time=3547] and I need Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse me.
[time=3553] I ask you to do that today, and live within me. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed the prayer of commitment today and you've accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior or have made another commitment, would you write us and tell us the nature of that decision?
[time=3571] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3578] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Bitterness",
[time=3584] please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
