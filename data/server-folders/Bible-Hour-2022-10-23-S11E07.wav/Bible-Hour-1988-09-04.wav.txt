[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] (bells ringing) There was not a prison cell.
[time=97] A pair of handcuffs are a straight jacket from which the great Houdini could not escape.
[time=104] It usually took him just a matter of seconds.
[time=107] But in one rather small, simple jail in the British Isles, the great escaped artist was confined for over two hours, playing with the lock using every trick and device he knew, but he could not unlock the door, only to discover at the end of his ordeal that the door had never been locked.
[time=129] Could it be today that you are confined in a prison with an unlocked door?
[time=136] (bells ringing) (bells ringing)
[time=148] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=153] Thank you for joining us.
[time=154] Rick's message today is entitled "Submission, The Ultimate Sign of Independence" and is taken from the Book of Colossians.
[time=161] "Submission, the very word irritates many of us.
[time=164] We, by our nature, want freedom and autonomy, not submission and surrender.
[time=169] Yet surprising as it may seem, submission is an unlocked door.
[time=173] It is not a prison which holds us against our will.
[time=176] The prison which confines us is ourself, lacking spiritual freedom over authority, every law and every institution, to which we must submit becomes a penitentiary.
[time=186] Jesus said, "I shall make you free, and you shall be free indeed." Today as we study God's word, we will learn that submission is the ultimate sign of independence.
[time=196] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to Colossians chapter 3.
[time=201] We will be looking at verse 18 through the end of the chapter and chapter 4, verse 1.
[time=206] Special music today will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir in Orchestra and our special guest, Sonya Portman.
[time=214] The Bible hours an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=223] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=233] It's a joy to assemble in this place and to lift our voices and praise of the Lord.
[time=238] It's such a privilege to come and to hear the choirs sing in the orchestra play along as they lead us in bringing worship before the throne of God.
[time=248] But most of all, we're thankful that we as people have the privilege of knowing Jesus Christ personally.
[time=253] We're delighted that you have come to worship with us.
[time=256] We welcome also our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=260] We pray that God will use this hour first and foremost to glorify His name.
[time=266] And then as we praise His name, that He would also bless us with insight and depth of insight into His Word.
[time=274] We're thankful that you've worshiped with us.
[time=276] We ask you now to quietly listen and enjoy the gift of our choir and orchestra, not just to us, but it's a gift of worship to the Lord.
[time=290] [MUSIC] Praise the Lord, O Lord of ours [MUSIC] Provin' His glory [MUSIC] As His name and worship Him [MUSIC] Praise the Lord, O Lord of ours [MUSIC] Provin' His glory [MUSIC] As His name and worship Him [MUSIC] Praise the Lord, O Lord of ours [MUSIC] Provin' His glory [MUSIC] As His name and worship Him [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, joyful sons of men's giving [MUSIC] Shout out to the sound of His faith in the coming love [MUSIC] Sing to the Lord, joyful sons of men's giving [MUSIC] Shout out to the sound of His faith in the coming love [MUSIC] My Jesus, I love thee [MUSIC] I know I know I know I know I know I know [MUSIC] For the era of glory [MUSIC] He's the singing of reason [MUSIC] My grace is the singing [MUSIC] The singing of heaven [MUSIC] In heaven and heaven [MUSIC] My Jesus is the song [MUSIC] I love thee in my life [MUSIC] I will love thee in heaven [MUSIC] And praise thee as long [MUSIC] As our land lets thee burn [MUSIC] And say, when of every [MUSIC] My song of my power [MUSIC] In heaven and heaven [MUSIC] I love thee [MUSIC] Our Jesus is the song [MUSIC] In heaven and heaven [MUSIC] Let's sing our hands [MUSIC] Our heaven and heaven [MUSIC] Let's sing our hands [MUSIC] And praise thee as long [MUSIC] Let's sing our hands [MUSIC] Let's sing our hands [MUSIC] Let's sing our hands [MUSIC] Our Jesus is the song [MUSIC] Child of mine, dear precious child divine [MUSIC] Son of the Father above [MUSIC] Child of mine, dear blessed child divine [MUSIC] Have come to bring us love [MUSIC] When you came [MUSIC] My heart was filled with joy [MUSIC] Such a dream [MUSIC] To hold my little blood [MUSIC] So you're proud [MUSIC] And still you're such a mystery [MUSIC] As you strive to sit [MUSIC] Our people free [MUSIC] And yet you're still this child of mine [MUSIC] Dear blessed child divine [MUSIC] Feeling the people [MUSIC] With your touch [MUSIC] Tenderly [MUSIC] You take away their broken dreams [MUSIC] And you breathe the love they need [MUSIC] So much [MUSIC] Now I watch [MUSIC] As you walk down this road [MUSIC] Helplessly [MUSIC] I follow on and on [MUSIC] 'Cause I stop [MUSIC] With madness that is happening [MUSIC] As the crowd [MUSIC] Shout to cry [MUSIC] Through the light [MUSIC] The King [MUSIC] My child [MUSIC] Remember God must die [MUSIC] To save the world [MUSIC]
[time=1423] [MUSIC - 61 seconds]
[time=1512] Thank you, Sonia.
[time=1515] Through the eyes of Mary, we feel the pathos, the heartache of the death of Christ.
[time=1522] We begin to experience the great sacrifice that God did make to send his son to die for not just the sins of the world.
[time=1533] That's too abstract to die for my sins.
[time=1537] I hope this morning you know Jesus Christ and the desire of your heart is to love him and to serve him.
[time=1545] The cover of our bulletin and an insert inside the bulletin gives us the theme "Building the Kingdom." I hope you haven't missed "Across the Street" by God's grace.
[time=1557] We're building a new sanctuary.
[time=1559] That has been a formidable challenge, but the real challenge is not simply to build a building, but to build a kingdom.
[time=1568] To build into the lives of men and women, principles of God's Word.
[time=1573] To train this generation in the next to be ambassadors for Christ.
[time=1578] And as we have labored as a congregation to build a building, so now our challenge is to build the kingdom.
[time=1586] With our new building, we'll see a tremendous increase in attendance and need for people to serve.
[time=1593] And one of the critical areas where we need people to serve is in the children's ministry.
[time=1598] There are literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of parents, like Rick and Kathy Hawks, who bring their little ones to the early elementary department, drop them off and then are free to worship, to go to Bible study, to serve, because somebody provides ministry to those children.
[time=1618] And then as we pick up those children we discovered that they were taught with excellence, principles and content out of God's Word.
[time=1627] That is a great heritage for my family, and I am grateful.
[time=1631] And we need people to sing in the choir, to play in the orchestra, to visit NEE, and particularly people to work with young and small children.
[time=1640] The insert tells you some of the jobs that are needed, and presently we have a very critical need, and I don't use that word lightly critical need for people to teach children's church.
[time=1653] Right now we have a children's church program going on this hour.
[time=1657] And Karen Horaceck did a marvelous job teaching and then moved to California.
[time=1663] Donna Christian has done an equally great job teaching in that program.
[time=1667] They're now moving to Indianapolis.
[time=1669] We're in deeply in debt to these people and are thankful for their labor and we need to replace them.
[time=1675] So if you would either like to teach in children's church or would like a transfer out of Fort Wayne, if you'll just sign up to teach children's church, that seems to be the pattern.
[time=1685] But we really do have a need in that area.
[time=1688] The sum are all up.
[time=1689] We are running into a dangerous situation.
[time=1692] Our church is growing extensively with numbers of people who will come and observe, but not with the numbers who will come and deserve.
[time=1700] That's not unique to us.
[time=1702] That's typical of churches in this generation.
[time=1705] Really what we need to be is we need to be people who do three things.
[time=1709] One, receive Jesus Christ as our Savior.
[time=1712] Two, find a local church and join it.
[time=1715] And three, serve in it.
[time=1717] I hope you'll do those three things.
[time=1719] Now a priority, memorizing God's word.
[time=1722] We bring back some verses by way of review.
[time=1726] As we study Colossians, the theme of that book is Colossians 2, 6, and 7.
[time=1731] Would you stand now that we can quote it together and Dale will lead us?
[time=1740] Colossians 2, 6, and 7.
[time=1744] So then, just as you receive Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him, rooted and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness.
[time=1761] Colossians 2, 6, and 7.
[time=1764] Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1769] Thank you, Dale, and now that you're seated, I would like to invite you to bow with me as we pray together.
[time=1776] Our God, we bow before you this morning to show our submission to you.
[time=1782] You are God, and you are a Master, and we submit to you today.
[time=1791] We come to ask your forgiveness for the times of self-emvision
[time=1798] that punctuated this past week, where we seize the reigns of our life and set all kept in this ship.
[time=1806] And so, God, we've come to resurrender to you.
[time=1810] We ask you to give strength and grace to those who struggle in their homes,
[time=1816] for women who must submit to a husband who is unkind or unloving, to a spouse who must live with a husband or a wife who is abusive in the act
[time=1827] or just as devastatingly in word.
[time=1831] We pray for those who spouses are victims of their own appetites,
[time=1839] and drugs and alcohol have destroyed not only their own life, but are eroding the fabric of their family.
[time=1846] God, we pray for grace and strength for each member of those families that you would sustain them, that you would refresh them.
[time=1856] Pray for those of us who struggle with our boss or with company policy, to follow and to cooperate.
[time=1866] It comes hard to us to submit, and so we begin by submitting to you even now.
[time=1873] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1879] It is a hard word.
[time=1882] Not so hard to preach, but it is hard to receive.
[time=1887] It's hard for me to receive it as I study the Scriptures.
[time=1891] It would be equally as hard for me to receive it if I were you seated today.
[time=1897] The single word submit.
[time=1900] There's something about it that it's a flash word.
[time=1903] It's one of those few words that provokes each of us, almost like the word cancer that grips us with both fear and resentment.
[time=1913] Submission.
[time=1915] It goes down hard for each of us, particularly for those of us who are Americans.
[time=1921] It's been woven into the fabric of our mentality that we are to be autonomous, we are to be assertive, we are to be self-proclaimed, independent, free agents in this wonderful land of America.
[time=1933] I mean, it's just been hammered into us.
[time=1936] I can remember as a little boy watching the wonderful world of Disney, and they would have very great themes out of American history like Johnny Tremaine and the Swamp Fox and the Puritans arriving to this country, but I remember the man playing Patrick Henry.
[time=1951] He captivated me as a young boy.
[time=1954] He stood in the actual house of Burgesses in Williamsburg, Virginia, and he quoted Patrick Henry's great speech.
[time=1962] "Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace.
[time=1967] The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the resounding clash of arms." I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[time=1982] I remember going out to the backyard and I chased 40 redcoats out of our neighborhood, and instilled within me as an American is this concept of freedom and autonomous control of my own destiny.
[time=1996] It was Benjamin Franklin who after he signed his name looked across the room and he said, "Gentlemen, we must hang together, or we will surely hang separately." So American tradition, that we stand our ground, nobody pushes us around.
[time=2015] This is our country.
[time=2017] This is our life.
[time=2019] And we are revolutionaries to the bone.
[time=2024] When somebody comes along and throws out a word submit, we think, "Isn't that outlawed one of the amendments to the Constitution?
[time=2032] It sounds almost un-American." For those of us that grew up in the '50s and '60s and '70s, this notion of autonomous self-determined individualism was pounded into our heads by the secular musicians.
[time=2049] Do you remember Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones as he would beat out the music of the '60s and he would say, "It's my life.
[time=2056] I'll do what I want to.
[time=2057] It's my life.
[time=2058] I'll do what I please." Or his song that went like this, "Hey, hey, he, he." Notice the poetic rhythm there.
[time=2067] Get off of my cloud.
[time=2069] This is my cloud.
[time=2071] This is my dream.
[time=2072] This is my life.
[time=2073] Get out of it.
[time=2075] The Irish Lee brothers put it to rhythm and they said, "It's your thing.
[time=2080] Do what you want to do.
[time=2081] It's your thing, baby." Come to the '70s and the direction of this autonomous revolutionary
[time=2089] spirit was particularly focused against the schools.
[time=2093] There's not a school teacher who doesn't remember two songs out of the '70s, smoking in the boys' room.
[time=2099] "Hey, teacher, don't give me those rules.
[time=2101] Everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school." And Pink Floyd's off the wall.
[time=2108] "Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone." The preachers and the politicians, the lawyers and the
[time=2120] legislatures are not the ones that shape a society.
[time=2125] It is the poet and the musician who is the pied piper of the
[time=2131] generations.
[time=2132] And the music and the drama has been a desperate call to live your
[time=2141] own life, to do your own thing, and to submit to no one.
[time=2149] But that's not just American.
[time=2151] It's just not post-60s.
[time=2154] It is actually the lemma of the human spirit.
[time=2158] As you survey the Bible, a quick view of mankind gives us great
[time=2165] insight into the dilemma today.
[time=2169] As you study through the Old Testament, you come to a prophet by the name of Isaiah who goes back before human history, and he tells us about an event that happened in heaven, one that greatly alters all of earth.
[time=2183] God had created various orders of angels, and at the pinnacle of these orders was one above all the others.
[time=2191] Created in splendor and majesty with beauty and intellect and power like no other created being.
[time=2198] This being was second only to God.
[time=2202] But in this being's heart, he made five statements recorded by Isaiah the prophet.
[time=2208] Each of the five statements began with two words.
[time=2211] They were, I will.
[time=2215] And each of those five statements were slicing off a piece of the pie that was God's.
[time=2222] Until the fifth statement said, I will be like God.
[time=2226] And that's Lucifer's rebellion in heaven.
[time=2231] When he said, I will be like God.
[time=2234] I will not submit to authority.
[time=2237] I will be God.
[time=2240] And then he personified himself in the form of a snake.
[time=2245] And he spoke and he beguiled Eve.
[time=2249] His temptation was not the temptation that this fruit tastes so good.
[time=2254] You have really never lived until you have tasted this one.
[time=2256] That wasn't the temptation.
[time=2258] The temptation wasn't that proverbial one that you can't pass by a sign that says don't.
[time=2264] Don't touch wet paint.
[time=2265] Oh, really?
[time=2266] Is that what?
[time=2267] It has to do it, but the temptation wasn't that.
[time=2270] The temptation with which he enticed her was this one.
[time=2275] Eve, take this fruit and you eat it.
[time=2279] Because God said don't eat it because he knows if you eat it, your eyes will be open and you will be like God.
[time=2288] And when Eve took that fruit, she was saying, I will be God.
[time=2293] I will not submit.
[time=2296] I will be autonomous.
[time=2298] I will run my own life.
[time=2303] And when she ingested that first bite and her husband followed her in the pattern, all of humanity died at that moment.
[time=2313] A sentence of death was passed upon all of us.
[time=2316] And the spirit that inhabits humanity and individuals is a
[time=2322] sinful, self-determined spirit that wants to submit to no one, beginning with God throughout every dimension of life.
[time=2332] If you have a copy of the Bible today, open it to Colossians chapter 3, and listen as I read chapter 3 verse 18 through the first verse of chapter 4.
[time=2343] Wives, submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.
[time=2351] Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
[time=2357] Children, obey your parents in everything.
[time=2363] For this pleases the Lord.
[time=2366] Fathers, do not bitter your children or they will become discouraged.
[time=2374] Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything.
[time=2379] And do it not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.
[time=2390] Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for men.
[time=2397] Since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as reward, it is the Lord Christ you are serving.
[time=2406] Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong and
[time=2412] there is no favoritism.
[time=2415] Masters, provide for your slaves what is right and fair
[time=2421] because you know that you also have a master in Heaven.
[time=2431] This passage of the Bible stands alone, it also stands parallel to several others that bring the theme.
[time=2440] In a single word it is that troubling one, submission.
[time=2445] It goes down hard.
[time=2448] To the day as we look at that passage, let me give you a real simple outline.
[time=2452] We are going to notice something old, something new, something timeless, something old.
[time=2460] There is not anything new in this passage when it comes to wives, childrens, responsibilities and slaves.
[time=2471] All of society, the Hebrew and the Greco-Roman taught the submission of those three groups respectively to husbands, parents and masters.
[time=2481] It is almost unimaginable to us to consider how harsh it was.
[time=2487] I in no way condone this, I only reported its history.
[time=2491] In the Hebrew culture and in the Greek one, the man was everything, the wife, not any better than his servant.
[time=2501] She was to be seen only if he wanted her to be seen.
[time=2508] To speak only if spoken to and then to respond with short direct answers.
[time=2513] She had no legal status.
[time=2515] In Hebrew society, a man could divorce his wife by going to the gates of the city saying I divorce her and clapping his hands three times and saying I divorce you.
[time=2524] It was done.
[time=2526] She could not divorce him for any reason, any circumstance
[time=2532] over any issue.
[time=2535] In the Roman society, the husband was free to do what he liked.
[time=2541] There was no such thing as wife abuse.
[time=2545] She was his property.
[time=2547] There was no such thing as fidelity amongst men.
[time=2550] A man was a man based upon how many affairs he had.
[time=2553] A wife had an affair, she would be put to death.
[time=2558] Children had it worse.
[time=2560] The Latin's had a term which they called patrias potestos.
[time=2564] It is Latin for the father's power.
[time=2568] And the father had absolute total power over his children.
[time=2573] They were his property and he could literally kill them if they were minors without it being a crime.
[time=2583] Masters could do the same to their slaves.
[time=2587] They owned their slaves in every way.
[time=2590] If a slave wanted to marry, he could only marry with the permission of the slave master.
[time=2597] And any children that were born were not theirs.
[time=2600] The children became the possession of the master and he could bequeath them to the parents or he could sell them.
[time=2607] They were his.
[time=2610] And this is not new for the Bible to say children obey wives
[time=2617] admit, slaves admit.
[time=2621] That's something old.
[time=2623] There is something brand new here that is absolutely revolutionary.
[time=2629] Let me quote a fine historian by the name of William Barkley.
[time=2635] Here the Christian ethic is an ethic of reciprocal obligation.
[time=2641] It is never an ethic upon which all the duties are on one side.
[time=2645] As Paul saw, husbands have a great duty and obligation as does
[time=2651] the wife.
[time=2653] Parents have just as binding a duty as children.
[time=2656] Masters have their responsibility as much as slaves.
[time=2660] This was an entirely new thing.
[time=2666] Just a few years earlier, the book of Galatians had been drafted by the Spirit of God and penned by Paul.
[time=2674] In Galatians chapter 3 verse 28 it says, "In Christ there is neither
[time=2681] Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are
[time=2687] all one in Christ." In this society there were slaves and there were slave owners.
[time=2697] There were women and there were men and there were children
[time=2704] and there were fathers.
[time=2706] Now the Bible says there are men and women and they are one.
[time=2710] They are equal.
[time=2712] There are slaves and slave masters.
[time=2714] They are one and they are equal.
[time=2717] There are parents and children and there are one and they are equal.
[time=2722] This is revolutionary.
[time=2725] This is more astounding than the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation put together.
[time=2735] There was no predecessor like John Locke who would inspire Thomas Jefferson.
[time=2740] This is a lightning bolt out of heaven.
[time=2744] And as we look at this passage you see six individuals in three groups and they are presented in a structural balance.
[time=2753] There are women and there are men each given a responsibility.
[time=2758] There are parents, there are children, mutual obligation.
[time=2764] There are slaves and there are masters with reciprocal responses.
[time=2769] This is something brand new.
[time=2773] Let's move through it slowly and deliberately and get the specifics.
[time=2777] The first of the six and we'll cover four today.
[time=2780] Wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.
[time=2785] There is a word that we struggle over.
[time=2789] The word submit.
[time=2790] It's actually a military word that means to place under in an order.
[time=2796] For example, if you're in the army and you're the private, you're under the corporal.
[time=2800] Don't brag corporal, you're under the sergeant.
[time=2802] Sergeant's under the lieutenant, the lieutenant under the captain and on it goes.
[time=2808] The word submit means to simply place and rank under.
[time=2813] It says nothing about a person's worth, their value, which is
[time=2819] superior.
[time=2820] The buck private may be of a higher intellect than the corporal
[time=2826] and the corporal may be a better man than the sergeant.
[time=2830] And the sergeant may be five times better than the lieutenant just saying they're placed in order under somebody.
[time=2838] And rank has a way of changing sometimes.
[time=2842] But when you're under, it doesn't matter whether you're smarter, stronger, more intelligent.
[time=2848] You're under.
[time=2849] That's your position.
[time=2851] During the Republican convention, just last month, a young senator from Indiana on Monday night, previous to the announcement of George Bush's choice for vice president, walked onto the floor of the convention without the appropriate credentials.
[time=2867] And this young senator quail was immediately escorted off of the floor by two guards who had rank.
[time=2876] On Tuesday night, it was announced that quail was the vice presidential choice.
[time=2881] And those two guards are now doing duty in Alaska.
[time=2888] The point is this.
[time=2889] On Monday, senator quail was senator quail.
[time=2893] And without credentials, he was not allowed on that floor because he was in a rank under in that structure.
[time=2901] On Tuesday, he wasn't any taller, smarter, more intelligent.
[time=2906] He was simply promoted to a new rank.
[time=2911] When the Bible says wives submit your husband, it's not saying that he's smarter, that he's taller, that he's anything other than God has placed the husband to be that leader in a home.
[time=2922] Now, the word submit does not mean decunker.
[time=2928] Here it says wives voluntarily submit to the husbands.
[time=2933] There's nowhere in Scripture that says husbands browbeat your wives into submission.
[time=2938] You cannot make somebody submit.
[time=2942] You can conquer them.
[time=2944] You can be a till the hunt and ravage them and destroy them, but you can't make them submit.
[time=2950] Submission is a choice of a free will that says I place myself
[time=2956] under this authority.
[time=2959] It goes hard sometimes.
[time=2962] I had signed up for 11 hours in college.
[time=2965] That's all I needed this semester.
[time=2967] My parents figured out that if I took 12 hours, that made me full time and we got an enormous insurance break.
[time=2975] A lot of money being saved for one class.
[time=2979] You know what you do when you need one hour.
[time=2982] You open up the catalog to the PE section.
[time=2986] I went down through it and there was a PE class that met at the perfect time for me.
[time=2992] It was beginner swimming.
[time=2994] I had spent my life swimming.
[time=2997] I had swam at Calgary Falls High School from 6 in the morning until 750 and ran over to class, ran out of class, and swam until 6 o'clock in the morning.
[time=3006] And I wasn't great, but I was good.
[time=3009] And I went into the teacher of the class to make my appeal.
[time=3014] As it would be, the teacher of this class was the assistant football coach.
[time=3019] He had a jersey that had number 58 on it.
[time=3021] I thought that was his playing number.
[time=3023] It was not.
[time=3024] It was his IQ.
[time=3026] And I appealed to him with the fact that I didn't need to learn how to swim.
[time=3032] I knew how to swim.
[time=3034] And could I just forget the class, come the last day, take the swimming test and call it done.
[time=3040] I said it cheerfully, and joyfully, and smilingly, and accommodatingly.
[time=3044] And he looked at me and said, boy, nobody cuts my class.
[time=3049] And I spent the rest of the semester holding on to a railing in the shallow end of a swimming pool, blowing bubbles in the water.
[time=3059] You know what?
[time=3061] He wasn't a better swimmer than I was.
[time=3064] I hope for my sake that he's not smarter than I am.
[time=3069] But you know what?
[time=3071] I was under him in rank.
[time=3073] He was the professor, and I was the student.
[time=3077] Don't read into this word what's not there.
[time=3079] It doesn't talk about one being better than the other smarter.
[time=3082] It simply means that we choose to place ourselves in a position.
[time=3086] And it is God who is so structured in the home that he says, men, we're to provide that godly leadership.
[time=3093] The wife is to supply the cooperative, submissive spirit.
[time=3098] But with that command to the wives, there comes equal instruction to the husbands.
[time=3104] Husbands, love your wives.
[time=3108] Those of you who have been around churches have heard that there are many words in the New Testament for love.
[time=3116] A quick review for the sake of those who may be new.
[time=3120] There are a number of words that were used in these days to describe love.
[time=3125] There was the word eros, which we get erotic.
[time=3128] And it's a response of love that says, wow, you're easy to love.
[time=3134] They're easy to love.
[time=3140] It is the love that says, out of reciprocal trading back and forth, it's a brotherly relationship.
[time=3146] I've given to you and you give back.
[time=3148] And there is a relationship of exchange.
[time=3150] And there's the love of agape, agapal, that says, I choose to love you.
[time=3156] It is the word that's used to describe how God loves us.
[time=3159] God didn't say, wow, you're easy to love.
[time=3163] If I can paraphrase Romans 5, he says, yuck, somebody better love you.
[time=3171] It's not for love that God says, boy, I think if I give you my love, you'll probably give it back.
[time=3177] So here it comes.
[time=3179] God said that while we were sinners, he loved us.
[time=3182] Men, the word here says, we're to love our wives the way God loves.
[time=3187] Ephesians 5, which parallels this as husbands, love your wives as Christ and love the church.
[time=3194] That's how we're to love.
[time=3196] Josh McDowell in his book, Givers, Takers and other kinds of lovers gives it much simpler.
[time=3201] He said, there are three types of love.
[time=3203] There's love if.
[time=3204] I love you if you'll help me pass this class.
[time=3207] I love you if you'll do it my way.
[time=3210] I love you if you'll give me your body when I want it.
[time=3214] It's not really love.
[time=3216] Oh, it's love.
[time=3217] I love myself so much I want to use you.
[time=3220] It's a little bit above it, but barely is love because.
[time=3223] It says, I love you because you're beautiful.
[time=3225] I love you because you're smart.
[time=3227] I love you because you have the potential of an earned income of $85,000.
[time=3232] I love you because.
[time=3234] But there's ultimately love period.
[time=3237] I love you.
[time=3238] It's not if.
[time=3239] It's not because I love you.
[time=3242] And men, we are to so love our wives.
[time=3245] And then he gives this further description and not be harsh.
[time=3249] Now this is all interpretation right now, but I think it's accurate.
[time=3253] The man who is harsh is the man who expects submission without supplying the love.
[time=3261] It does happen, but it is so rare that a wife does not want to submit to a husband who supplies the love.
[time=3273] When the love is there, the submission sort of follows, but it's a harsh man who doesn't supply the love and still expects the submission.
[time=3286] Then he moves on to a new group.
[time=3288] Children obey your parents and everything.
[time=3290] We're going to memorize that in the Hawks House this week.
[time=3292] That's a delightful verse of scripture.
[time=3297] Responsibility comes to children to obey. One commentator wisely tells us this.
[time=3304] If children do not learn to submit and honor authority in the home, they will struggle with it in every arena outside the home.
[time=3316] We live in a very permissive time, and even though you and I may look at ourselves and say, we're conservative on various issues, most of us are in the peril of permissive parenting.
[time=3326] Let me share with you three mistakes that I see in my own life.
[time=3331] I am not pointing at you without indicting myself, but things that I hope we all work hard in correcting in our children.
[time=3339] The first mistake we make in parenting over this issue of obedience is one.
[time=3345] We don't expect our children to listen the first time.
[time=3349] A classic illustration took place in our home. We had an out-of-town guest staying in our home. She was there, and she had just put little honey to bed.
[time=3358] I'm not sure who made it out of the bedroom faster. The lady or little honey.
[time=3364] But as she walked out, she said, "No honey, you get back in bed," and she sat down in the chair and beginning doing things with needles and thread that I don't understand.
[time=3372] And it was kind of, you know, knit one, purl two, honey go to bed. Knit one, purl two, honey go to bed. An old honey was everywhere but in bed.
[time=3380] And she had finished making a blanket that could have covered the entire IU football team and still was saying, honey go to bed.
[time=3389] And honey learned that if it doesn't mean anything the first time, it probably doesn't mean anything the 99th time either.
[time=3397] Now let me tell you about my dad. My mom was the soft one. Our family and my dad was the discipline.
[time=3403] Be playing down at Purdue Street Stadium. I lived on Purdue Street. It has nothing to do with that school in western Indiana somewhere.
[time=3410] But we had this empty field and every great football player in America played there. We played against Jim Brown, Johnny United.
[time=3417] And my mom would come and she'd yell down to come home. I'd hear my mother's voice. That meant two or three more sets of downs, guys.
[time=3423] She'd come out and she'd yell again and that meant a few more plays. She'd come out and yell again. I had the ball. I'm not going home.
[time=3430] Although when they got the ball, my dad come out, he'd say Rick and I was home. I don't even know what he was going to say. I was just home.
[time=3440] Because when he said it, he said it one time.
[time=3445] The second mistake we make in parents is that we don't discipline them. We vent our anger at them. It's a well-stayed charade.
[time=3454] We know our role. They know theirs. We get exasperated. So we go after them. We maybe give them a swat. We maybe just give them a verbal tongue lashing.
[time=3464] We vent all this anger. They burst into tears. They've got us convinced that they got the message because they cried.
[time=3470] We go back and sit down and assume that we've handled the matter and they go back and do whatever it was that exasperated us.
[time=3479] That's not discipline. That's venting anger.
[time=3505] We've been sharing with you the special music from our guest Sanja Poorman and the sanctuary choir.
[time=3511] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3514] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3521] Will you pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3530] And today I know that I'm a sinner and I need you to come in and to cleanse me and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3537] I ask you to do that today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3543] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3547] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3554] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Closer Walk", please write to The Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3569] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1359 or use the sermon title "Submission, the Ultimate Sign of Independence".
[time=3579] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3584] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3595] Perhaps you have thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry. Why not do it today?
[time=3600] I know it would be an encouragement to pastor Rick and the entire Bible Hour staff.
[time=3604] To correspond with us, simply write to The Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
