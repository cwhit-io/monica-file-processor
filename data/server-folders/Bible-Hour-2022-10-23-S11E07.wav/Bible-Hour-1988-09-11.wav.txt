[time=91] Howard Hendricks tells the story of an incidental flight back to Dallas.
[time=97] One of the passengers was irate over constant delays in the flight schedule, and his two martinis at the airport further exasperated his temper.
[time=108] By the time the plane had landed, he was storming his way off the plane, only to find that there was not a ramp.
[time=114] He was irate and exasperated, and he let it all fly on one female flight attendant.
[time=121] She calmly took it, graciously responded to his anger, and asked him kindly to return to his seat.
[time=128] The whole incident was quenched by her gracious spirit.
[time=133] As all the other passengers left the plane, Hendricks remained to say a word to this lady.
[time=138] He said, "Madam, you are a credit to this airline, and they should be proud to have you as one of their employees.
[time=146] They are lucky that you work for them." The lady said, "Sir, I don't work for this airline." He said, "What? You took all that guff, and you don't work for this airline?" She said, "No, sir. I work for the Lord Jesus Christ." He happens to have me on assignment for this airline.
[time=177] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=181] Thank you for joining us.
[time=183] Today Rick is continuing his series from the Book of Colossians with a message he has entitled, "Does My Work Matter to God?" For whom do you work?
[time=193] IBM General Motors, a small family business, or are you a homemaker or a house builder?
[time=199] Did you ever consider that you work directly for Jesus Christ your Lord?
[time=203] He has you on assignment, station, that's your present job site.
[time=208] No matter how significant or insignificant your job may appear to others or yourself, your work is important to God.
[time=215] Today as we study Colossians, we will uncover timeless principles for both employees and employers on working for the Lord in the marketplace.
[time=225] Perhaps on a frustrating day of the job you have wondered, "Does My Work Matter to God?" We encourage you to study along with us from the Book of Colossians.
[time=235] We will be looking at chapter 3, verse 22, through chapter 4, verse 1.
[time=241] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=246] Our special music guest today is Buddy Green.
[time=251] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=259] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=263] Now here's Rick.
[time=267] It's our privilege to welcome thousands of friends who join us by way of television into our home here at Black Hawk, and we're thankful that you've come that we can worship together.
[time=278] See each other's faces and lift our voices together.
[time=281] We're privileged to have outreach by way of television, but there's something so special about being face to face sharing the Lord Jesus Christ with each other, praising Him and speaking and seeing of His majesty until He comes again.
[time=296] I know that the choir will minister to your heart as they sing of the majestic greatness of our Lord.

[time=864] Lord, I want to thank you for loving me the way that you do.
[time=868] You turn me around in the light of the truth.
[time=871] Lord, I want to thank you.
[time=873] Here we go.
[time=875] Lord, I want to thank you for loving me the way that you do.
[time=879] You turn me around in the light of the truth.
[time=881] Lord, I want to thank you in the middle of the night.
[time=886] And I hope inside.
[time=889] Lord, you found me there with your wonderful light.
[time=893] Yeah, now I want to give you praise for the rest of my day.
[time=897] For when I think of the way you love me, Lord, I'm amazed.
[time=901] Here we go.
[time=902] Lord, I want to thank you for loving me the way that you do.
[time=907] You turn me around in the light of the truth.
[time=910] Lord, I want to thank you.
[time=912] Every night and every day.
[time=914] Lord, I want to pray.
[time=916] 'Cause you feed my soul in the best kind of way, yeah, yeah.
[time=921] You win a stumbling fall.
[time=923] For you're the one that I call.
[time=925] And you're always there to help me, Lord, any time at home.
[time=929] Lord, can you help me now?
[time=931] Lord, I want to thank you for loving me the way that you do.
[time=935] You turn me around in the light of the truth.
[time=937] Lord, I want to thank you.
[time=940] Thank you, Lord, Lord, I want to thank you for loving me the way that you do.
[time=946] You turn me around in the light of the truth.
[time=948] Lord, I want to thank you.
[time=951] I believe in that love.
[time=957] Thank the Lord.
[time=959] And thank you for saving me.
[time=961] [APPLAUSE]
[time=966] We're thrilled to have Buddy Green with us today as our musical guest.
[time=970] And we're equally as excited that you've joined us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=975] Pete, I hope that this day is a great day for you and all the work that went into it is greatly appreciated.
[time=981] Well, thank you, Rick.
[time=982] You know, we've anticipated Buddy Green coming for a long time.
[time=985] And we're glad that he's here today and certainly contributes to our ministry.
[time=990] Well, we're glad that he's here and hope that you'll take opportunity to join us for some of the special events like this that come to us in the future.
[time=998] And the next big event on our calendar is the dedication of our new sanctuary across the street here at Blackhawk on the weekend of October 14th, 15th, and 16th.
[time=1009] It's really hard not to smile when you announce that, Rick, but it's going to be an exciting weekend.
[time=1014] We're continuing to pray that the Lord allows us to get in during that time.
[time=1018] A lot of work to do, but it's going to be an exciting weekend.
[time=1021] Beginning with Friday evening, October 14th, we'll have Nielsen and Young, dual pianists coming to play a concert for us, just inspiring music on two pianos.
[time=1030] That'll be a wonderful night together.
[time=1032] And then on Saturday, David Jeremiah, who is the first pastor of our church and the founder of the Bible Hour, will be back to celebrate with us, giving a strong message out of God's Word.
[time=1043] And then on Sunday, at 3 o'clock for the formal dedication, Dr. David Burnham will be here.
[time=1049] Many of you will recognize that name as I have often mentioned him as the man who led me to Christ, and he spoke here about a year ago on the Bible Hour.
[time=1058] Then during the month of August, he was the featured teacher on the Day of Discovery.
[time=1063] Presently, he's in Korea, ministering to international athletes as the head of a worldwide sports coalition.
[time=1069] He'll be fresh back from those Olympic games to challenge us with God's Word on Sunday, October the 16th.
[time=1075] So that'll be a busy weekend.
[time=1077] I'm looking forward to hearing him speak again, and the choir and orchestra and special music will be a part of every service, and it's just going to be a great time of celebration and thanksgiving.
[time=1087] So we want to invite you to come and to come in person to the dedication weekend, October 14th at 7 o'clock, 15th at 7 o'clock, and the 16th at 3 in the afternoon.
[time=1099] We hope you'll join us then.
[time=1101] Right now, lots of work remains to be done on the new building.
[time=1105] Many of the men of our television crew are working overtime as volunteers, pulling wires, fixing mike cables, putting in camera wires.
[time=1114] It's an unbelievable task.
[time=1116] There are literally miles and miles and miles of cable to be run, and they're doing it all as volunteers, and we greatly appreciate their efforts.
[time=1125] Also this morning, we want to share a booklet with you that is of great value so that you can have a closer walk with God.
[time=1133] In fact, the book has that title, "Closer Walk." It's a daily Bible study guide so that you can grow in your relationship with the Lord through studying His Word in prayer.
[time=1144] It takes you through the New Testament in one year, and it begins in October, so we want to encourage you to write now and ask for a closer walk.
[time=1153] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1162] And as Rick mentioned, we need to encourage you to write now so you can get started in this systematic Bible study.
[time=1168] And once again, the address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1177] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today here on the Bible Hour.
[time=1198] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1258] Sing that chorus.
[time=1260] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=1299] We need the Lord.
[time=1301] In everything we do, every breath we take.
[time=1305] And especially when we try to lead the life that He wants us to lead.
[time=1309] We need His Spirit.
[time=1310] I want to sing a song that's a prayer to God for it's just a prayer of need.
[time=1317] And if you'd like to make this your prayer as I sing it, you go right ahead.
[time=1321] [MUSIC]
[time=1333] Oh Lord, I need Your love to be ever in my heart.
[time=1342] And Lord, by walking in Your love, you'll never be alone.
[time=1352] Keeping your word in all I do is Your commitment and love things we'll do.
[time=1366] Oh Lord, how I need You.
[time=1372] [MUSIC]
[time=1379] Lord, You convict me of my sins and tell me to confess.
[time=1389] And if I do, and trust in You and You will provide my rest.
[time=1399] For You are faithful and righteous too.
[time=1404] Forgive my sins and to cleanse me from all my unrighteousness.
[time=1418] It's not because I know You.
[time=1424] And it's not because I love You.
[time=1429] It's only because You first love me that I've come to know You.
[time=1439] That I've come to love You.
[time=1446] And Lord, I know Your Spirit has come and let me understand.
[time=1456] That if I abide in Your holy Word, I'm truly a part of Your plan.
[time=1466] So help me to be what You want me to be, that's my request.
[time=1475] And nothing less can do.
[time=1481] Lord, how I need You.
[time=1502] Our God and our Father, we have heard this morning the phrase, I need You.
[time=1509] And we've sung ourselves, we need Thee, oh we need Thee.
[time=1516] Every hour we need Thee.
[time=1520] And we come to this moment today to say that we need You Lord.
[time=1525] And to confess to You that we need You to forgive our sinfulness.
[time=1532] We've come today to confess our corporate and our individual guilt.
[time=1538] And we need You to cleanse us and to make us new.
[time=1542] To erase those moments of belligerent sin that punctuated this past week.
[time=1550] And to blot out those hours of apathetic indifference.
[time=1557] We need You Lord.
[time=1559] We need You today to provide for us refuge.
[time=1564] Father, today we would ask that You would shelter and protect and uphold those who need the refuge in the face of death.
[time=1574] You prayed this morning for the family of Kerry Roderick that they would have confidence to know that while she is absent from us, she is present with You.
[time=1585] We pray for Ted Roberts today as he travels for his mother's funeral.
[time=1591] That You would give him words not only for his own heart but the comfort family members, even some who need to know Christ.
[time=1600] Pray today for Rich and Debbie Snyder as they face the painful loss of a child through miscarriage.
[time=1609] God, we need You for refuge.
[time=1613] God, we need You for wisdom as we seek to know how to mend broken relationships, to motivate rebellious students to heal bitter years of mistreatment.
[time=1629] We need You.
[time=1632] Father, we need You to make us sense our significance and our worth.
[time=1637] As too many of us have placed the value in our life and our job.
[time=1643] And all we have become is an employee and not a person.
[time=1649] Some have lost their jobs and are feeling slighted in their value.
[time=1655] Help them to know they have value in You, and yet at the same time we prayed that You would provide jobs for them.
[time=1663] Father, we pray today that as we study Your Word, we would find worth in serving You.
[time=1670] In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1676] In the play Peter Pan, there's this dialogue between Peter Pan and the children's mother, Mrs. Darling.
[time=1686] "Would You send me to school?" said Peter Pan.
[time=1692] Mrs. Darling responds.
[time=1694] "Yes, I would." "Then to an office?" "I suppose so," she responded.
[time=1705] "Soon I'll be a man." "Very soon," she told Peter.
[time=1713] "I won't go to school. I won't grow up. I won't study solemn things. I won't be a man.
[time=1718] I want to be a little boy and play all the time." It sounds good to me.
[time=1724] I think there's a Peter Pan in each one of us.
[time=1727] There's a part of each one of us that says, "I don't want to study solemn things.
[time=1734] I don't want to grow up. I want to play." And yet it's been rightfully said that play and leisure are the desserts of life.
[time=1748] Work is the meal, and it's only a child who wants to eat, only the desserts of life.
[time=1757] This morning we want to ask the question, "Does my work matter to God?"
[time=1764] I don't mean my work as a pastor, but I mean all of our works.
[time=1768] Does it matter to God?
[time=1770] Is it important to God that you build buildings and at the end of the day your hands are calloused and your back is sore and a building is partially erected?
[time=1780] Does that matter to God?
[time=1782] Or is it just brick upon block, brick upon block?
[time=1786] Does it matter to God that you look into a terminal for eight hours a day and those little green letters get smaller and blurrier as the day goes along?
[time=1797] And no matter how many things you process, there's always somebody saying, "Can you give me your work matter to God?" Does it matter to God that your labor is within your house and that you have provided for your family, care and provision of food and of a home?
[time=1817] Does that really matter to God?
[time=1821] Does our work matter to God?
[time=1824] Or is our work something that we do to survive and then over here we've got to find something, then that something is what matters to God?
[time=1834] If you have a Bible, I invite you to open it to Colossians chapter 3.
[time=1840] We want to ask the question, does my work have worth?
[time=1846] Does my work today have worth?
[time=1851] Colossians 3.22 continues our study from last week.
[time=1856] Paul writes, "Slaves obey your earthly masters in everything
[time=1864] and do it not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.
[time=1875] Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord and not for men."
[time=1885] Since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward,
[time=1891] it is the Lord Christ you are serving.
[time=1895] Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong and there is no favoritism.
[time=1903] Chapter 4, verse 1.
[time=1906] Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair,
[time=1912] because you know that you also have a master in heaven.
[time=1918] Well, obviously the words master and slave leap off the page and grab our attention.
[time=1925] Out of the pages of American history come some gloomy chapters.
[time=1931] The days of slavery of the black man.
[time=1935] We have been educated and rightfully so of the evils and the atrocities of slavery.
[time=1942] And yet we look at this and say, "Well then why didn't God say, "Masters, emancipate your slaves.
[time=1950] "Slaves, walk out, rebel."
[time=1957] Where was the dear Ed Scott of Paul's day?
[time=1962] That is a nagging question.
[time=1965] Warren Wiersby gives us this insight.
[time=1968] The purpose of the early church was to spread the gospel and to win people to Christ.
[time=1976] Had the first Christians been branded as anti-government or anti-society, they would have been greatly hindered in their chief endeavor.
[time=1987] I might add, the approach of the gospel is to change society by changing hearts.
[time=1994] The society never changes by legislation.
[time=1998] It always changes by personal choices.
[time=2002] In the nation we tried to legislate a view of alcohol and so prohibition was forced upon a nation, but there was never a heart for that and it failed.
[time=2012] But as you study the history even of this country, you discover that the era of great social reform had a predecessor.
[time=2021] It was in the 1840s that women's suffrage began to mount as a movement in this country.
[time=2027] It was in the 1840s that prison reform became an issue in the society of America.
[time=2033] It was in the 1840s that the abolitionist movement to a free America of slavery and to emancipate the slaves came to a steamhead.
[time=2042] Was there something about that decade, the 1840s?
[time=2046] Yes, there was.
[time=2047] You see, the 1840s, the era of social reform followed at a previous era.
[time=2053] The predecessor is what historians now call the second great awakening in America.
[time=2059] Men like Charles Finney went from tree stump to pulpit and tree stump throughout New York and Kentucky and that wilderness of Indiana and they preached a gospel revival and there came a change in those hearts of society and then society would change its values.
[time=2077] And so the gospel is declared to change hearts, not to change society.
[time=2082] That's the second domino that will fall, but the dominoes will never fall in America and will never fall in South Africa until there's a change of heart.
[time=2092] Should we legislate?
[time=2093] Yes, we should.
[time=2094] More than anything else, we need to declare Jesus Christ as the great emancipator.
[time=2099] Then as you come to this passage, do we ask the question?
[time=2103] Well, if this is slavery and masters and we've rid ourselves of that, can we eliminate this passage from Scripture?
[time=2111] No, there is some timeless insight here that would be greatly missed if we ignored it.
[time=2119] In the Roman world, it's estimated by William Barkley that one out of every two people were slaves.
[time=2127] Some of them were in slavery and the most harsh, brutal form our mind can imagine, but most were slavery to a more pleasant, though not tolerable situation.
[time=2141] A situation where a man would have his own home, perhaps.
[time=2145] Family, wife and children, and property.
[time=2148] But he was still a slave to a Roman citizen who could never be enslaved.
[time=2154] And as such, he had great liberty and autonomy but a responsibility to work for his master.
[time=2162] And that day, as many as one, out of every two were slaves.
[time=2168] And so, for application then and now, we could change the word slave to employee
[time=2178] and the word master to employer.
[time=2181] And actually, those words have not completely left our vocabulary today.
[time=2186] For example, in the field of education, if you go to college and you graduate your first degree where there be a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts, hopefully none of the men graduate as just a bachelor.
[time=2199] That's not the goal of college.
[time=2201] But you graduate with either a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science.
[time=2207] But if you go back and you pursue the advanced degree, you receive what's called a master's degree.
[time=2215] That means that you are proficient as a master in that field.
[time=2221] If you go into a trade, you may enter that trade as an apprentice and work your way up to journeyman, but the goal is to become the master craftsman.
[time=2230] If you're a golfer, they have a tournament down in Augusta, Georgia.
[time=2234] It is called the master's.
[time=2236] I have not yet been invited to that.
[time=2239] Neither of you. I don't know why you laugh.
[time=2244] And so, the word master survives in our language today to speak of ownership, of expertise, of leadership and occasionally of employment.
[time=2255] We can take these verses and they're just as real and relevant today as employee and employer.
[time=2263] So, let's look at it and follow that simple outline.
[time=2266] God has some insights for employees and employers as well.
[time=2271] We turn first to the employees as does the text.
[time=2275] Slaves, employees, honor, obey your masters and everything and do it not only when their eye is on you to win their favor but with sincerity of heart.
[time=2285] I find here, first of all, responsibilities for employees and then reasons to support them.
[time=2294] Six responsibilities to those of us who would be good employees.
[time=2301] First of all, a good employee is one whose work is done thoroughly.
[time=2310] If you'll notice it says, slaves obey your earthly masters in everything.
[time=2317] All of us can divide our job, whether a pastor or a postman,
[time=2323] whether we're a house builder or a housewife, whether we work in a factory or on the road, we can divide our job into two categories.
[time=2334] Those parts of the job we like and those parts that we dislike.
[time=2339] There's the upside and there's the downside.
[time=2342] And it usually shows very quickly.
[time=2344] There are some salesmen that they are loquacious, talkative, gregarious, outgoing, they could sell ice to an Eskimo on a cold day.
[time=2353] And man, they can't get the paperwork turned in the office to get delivery done ever.
[time=2358] They like the people side, they don't like the administrative side.
[time=2363] They're other salesmen, I mean they could administrate and they've got sales plans and they've got charts and they've got golds and they've got record keeping.
[time=2371] They just don't have anything to keep on the records.
[time=2374] They like to go out, like that face-to-face potential rejection.
[time=2379] There are some doctors who they love medicine and they have to practice it on people.
[time=2388] There are other doctors who love people and their waiting room is lined up with them
[time=2395] waiting for medicine because they just love to talk to each one of them.
[time=2400] There are some pastors that love people.
[time=2404] It's individuals that they can't stand.
[time=2408] And they want an audience out there.
[time=2410] They want to go Monday through Friday, they want to study Greek, Hebrew, Pig Latin, anything.
[time=2416] Just jimmy my books.
[time=2418] And they want people out there so someone hears this.
[time=2422] But individuals, not so much.
[time=2426] There are other pastors that all they love individuals, they'll talk to anybody, they'll help anybody, they'll do anything.
[time=2432] On Sunday morning you know they've done something else all week long.
[time=2437] Every job as the side we like and the side we don't like,
[time=2443] and a good man and a good woman is thorough in everything.
[time=2450] A book has been written by a professor at Harvard University titled, What They Didn't Teach You at Harvard Business School.
[time=2458] In the heart of that book he says, regardless of your job and your job description,
[time=2465] you will be evaluated on three principles, commitment, attention to detail, and immediate follow through.
[time=2474] A high endorsement for being thorough.
[time=2478] Secondly, under responsibilities of employees, is the responsibility to work consistently.
[time=2485] It says, obey your masters and everything and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win favor.
[time=2497] Consistency is the quality of life that says, I perform the same whether I'm inspected or I'm only expected.
[time=2507] In a sense it has the value of being trustworthy.
[time=2512] You don't have to be under constant supervision.
[time=2515] Rocho Marx put it this way, he once said, no man leaves before his time unless the boss already left.
[time=2528] Consistency.
[time=2530] Somebody whose performance is the same whether they're under the scrutiny of the boss's eye
[time=2536] or they are not.
[time=2539] The value that we could learn is this.
[time=2544] It's far better not to learn the tricks of the trade, but simply to learn the trade itself.
[time=2552] A friend that gave us this past week a piece of paper that showed tips for taking a test.
[time=2559] There were 37 of those tips.
[time=2562] I could have memorized the material before I could have memorized the tips for taking the test.
[time=2567] It's just better to do the work thoroughly and to do it consistently.
[time=2573] Not just when the boss is looking.
[time=2576] I like this one liner that I read this morning.
[time=2580] When the cats away the mice will be rats.
[time=2586] A good employee is one who is consistent.
[time=2590] A third responsibility is an employee who is sincere.
[time=2594] I'm not a great Greek scholar, but I can read the English books that tell me what they say.
[time=2600] And the word here for sincerity is a two part word.
[time=2605] It's the word fold preceded with the word without.
[time=2610] Hence sincerity is someone without folds.
[time=2615] What does that mean?
[time=2618] Well, have you ever bought something and on the outside it looks good.
[time=2622] You took it home, you unpinned it, you opened it up, you unfolded it and there you discovered the flaws.
[time=2629] Kathy has discovered a place back in our hometown of Akron, Ohio where you can buy beautiful wallpaper for a dollar or two dollars a row.
[time=2637] It's wonderful stuff, but unroll it before you leave the store.
[time=2643] Because it's not what's on the outside that you alone buy.
[time=2647] It's what's on the inside.
[time=2650] Sometimes holes, sometimes ink runs, sometimes nothing.
[time=2657] The person who is a good employee is one who there are no folds in their life.
[time=2666] What you see is what you get.
[time=2669] It's real, it's genuine, it's authentic.
[time=2673] No cover up, no top dressing, the real stuff from top to bottom.
[time=2680] Our word sincere comes from two Latin words.
[time=2683] Cine, which means without, here up, wax.
[time=2690] I have a friend Craig Clapper who signs a lot of his letters without wax.
[time=2696] You see the potter of the ancient day would make his pottery, paint it and glaze it and shelf it.
[time=2705] If it would crack as a changed temperature, he might then take wax, fill in the crack, smooth it over and repaint it and you'd never see it.
[time=2720] But it wasn't consistent, the pottery did not have integrity.
[time=2725] A good pot was one that was without wax.
[time=2730] A good employee is one, without folds, without wax.
[time=2738] Fourthly, a good employee is one who works diligently.
[time=2743] I like this phrase.
[time=2746] Verse 23, "Whatever you do, work at it."
[time=2752] There's no substitute for diligence.
[time=2755] A young guy graduated from college, they had a big graduation party.
[time=2759] All of the in-laws and the out-laws gathered around the path of the young lad on the head and say, "Way to go."
[time=2765] One of his uncles said, "Well, now that you've graduated from college, are you looking for work?"
[time=2771] He said, "No, but I could use a job." You know, the number of people unemployed in America is not nearly as high as the number of people who are not working.
[time=2785] The value of a good employee is someone who is diligent and who works hard.
[time=2794] This poem from James Russell Lowe, "No man is born into the world whose work is not born with him."
[time=2804] There is always work and the tools to work with all for those who will and blessed are the hands of toil.
[time=2816] The fifth quality of a good employee is one who works enthusiastically.
[time=2824] It says, "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart."
[time=2836] There are numbers of us who go to work, we are on time, we do our job, and on the company bulletin board is this reminder of our work.
[time=2847] If you don't believe in the resurrection of the dead, stick around till quitting time.
[time=2852] There's no life in us, there's no enthusiasm, there's no spark.
[time=2858] And no matter what your job is, the zest comes in the door with you, it's not there waiting for you.
[time=2867] Albert Camus said, "Without work, all of life goes rotten, but when work is soulless, life sniffles and dies."
[time=2882] You alone can bring the enthusiasm to your life and to your work.
[time=2888] Without it the most exhilarating and thrilling of work can become routine and boring.
[time=2894] And with it, the most apparently mundane of tasks can become exciting.
[time=2901] It's been said about the quality of the enthusiastic worker, that it's better to have two people working with you than a dozen working for you.
[time=2911] Their heart is in it, enthusiasm.
[time=2915] Sixthly, if the dominant theme of these verses is a good employee works spiritually.
[time=2925] Verse 23, "Whatever you do, do it, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord and not for men."
[time=2937] Howard Hendricks of Dallas Seminary tells this story. He waited in an airport and waited in an airport.
[time=2944] Delay upon delay kept his flight from leaving.
[time=2948] One of the other passengers passed the time by hitting the lounge at the airport.
[time=2956] Pounding down one drink after another, he passed the time until the flight took off.
[time=2962] But the confusion hadn't ended. The plane finally landed at its destination and could not disembark its passengers because the ground crew was understaffed.
[time=2972] The drinking man became furious and I raped.
[time=2975] And he let one flight attendant have it as though it was her fault that everything had gone wrong and lashed out at her without mercy.
[time=2983] She took it. She was gracious. She smiled.
[time=2988] She did everything she could to make his bad stay more comfortable and was so winsome that she was capable of calming him down.
[time=2997] Hendricks said, "I waited till every passenger left the plane to talk to this gal."
[time=3003] Howard Hendricks said, "I went up to her and I said, "Ma'am, you are to be congratulated for you.
[time=3008] How you handle that difficult individual. You are a credit to this airline for whom you work."
[time=3016] He smiled and said, "Sir, I don't work for this airline." And Rick said, "What? You took all of that and you only worked for the airline?"
[time=3025] She said, "No, sir. I work for the Lord Jesus Christ and He has given me a temporary assignment on this airplane."
[time=3033] That's working spiritually.
[time=3038] That's viewing that everything we do, we don't do it for people.
[time=3043] We don't do it for the boss. We don't do it for the company. We do it for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3049] Did you cook a meal last night and your kids looked at it, poked at it, rejected it, ridiculed it, and you wanted to serve it back to them a second time at high speed?
[time=3068] Kathy worked a few hours yesterday. I made the grilled cheese.
[time=3076] Hey, if it's black on the outside, it's still cheese on the inside.
[time=3083] And this message comes to mind, "Lord, I'm cooking you a grilled cheese sandwich so your kids can eat it. They better eat it."
[time=3091] And that's not spiritual. Spiritual is what I do. It may seem routine.
[time=3097] But to God, it is worth. If we do it for Him.
[time=3101] Well, there's six responsibilities and here comes the reasoning. It's found in verse 24.
[time=3107] Sense you know. Need to know this. You already know it. Sense you know, but let's remind ourselves.
[time=3114] Sense you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.
[time=3120] Four reasons follow. One is, God will reward those who do right. Truth and time go hand in hand.
[time=3132] Secondly, it says, "You are serving the Lord Christ."
[time=3143] Our translators here at the NIV have translated it in the indicative, which means a simple statement.
[time=3150] There's more evidence that's an imperative instead of it saying, "It is the Lord Christ you are serving." It should say, "You serve Christ the Lord."
[time=3161] Don't worry about the company policy. Don't worry about the boss. Don't worry about the inequity of reward.
[time=3168] You serve Christ. Third reasoning.
[time=3175] The Lord will pay those who are doing wrong.
[time=3182] Somebody else in the company is not working as hard as you were. The Lord will handle that.
[time=3188] Somebody else got a promotion and you're more suited. The Lord will handle that.
[time=3193] Somebody is skipping out on company time, patting expense reports and it's getting on your skin.
[time=3198] The Lord will handle that. Fourthly is reasoning. With God, there's no impartiality.
[time=3206] Is your boss play favorites? Oh, here's the formal corporate ladder that anybody can complain.
[time=3212] They can climb that one. But you know there's an informal ladder.
[time=3219] If you really want to get ahead, then you've got a jog with the boss.
[time=3223] You've got to play golf with him. You've got to show up with the benefit functions for the things he's hot on.
[time=3230] You sit there and you work hard. You see this guy doesn't work hard and suddenly he's moving up the ladder because the boss likes him.
[time=3238] Remember, who do you work for? The Lord's impartial.
[time=3245] Now we come to the absolutely revolutionary part of this passage.
[time=3250] And that is God turns the attention away from the slave to the slave owner. That wasn't done.
[time=3258] This is revolutionary and radical. And responsibility is placed upon the slave master.
[time=3264] Responsibility is placed upon the employer.
[time=3269] Officers provide for your slaves what is right and fair. Two responsibilities for the employer. One to provide what is right.
[time=3279] Probably has here an idea, the idea of compensation, paying them fairly.
[time=3286] To compensate them for their work. If the company prospers, so should the employees, not just the management.
[time=3293] If there are benefits to be dispensed, they ought to do more than trickle down eventually.
[time=3300] Please note that the word right is the root of the word righteous.
[time=3305] And God sees it as a spiritual issue that we treat people right.
[time=3311] Particularly our employees. Secondly, it says treat them fairly.
[time=3316] It is a word that means equally. A word from which mathematicians we get the word isosceles as in an isosceles triangle that has equal sides.
[time=3329] There is great debate over what does it mean equally. Here are five suggestions.
[time=3335] One, Paul was saying masters treat them as equal emancipate the slaves.
[time=3341] Or treat them equally by responding to their hard work with equal compensation.
[time=3348] Thirdly, it may mean to treat each slave equally to be impartial.
[time=3354] Finally, it may mean to treat the slaves equally as God has treated the slave master.
[time=3360] Or finally, the one I prefer it means to treat them as equals as men in the spiritual brotherhood of Christ.
[time=3369] I think that has great implication today. I may be the boss, but my friend Steve Longbreak is an equal brother in Christ.
[time=3381] The board may be the boss, but the CEO is still a man to be treated equally as a man.
[time=3389] The boss is the boss and should always be respected and certainly his position.
[time=3395] But I think here it's a warning in threatening and manipulating, condescending and treating others as inferior or insignificant because they don't hold the same position we do.
[time=3409] Can I confess to you that those of my occupation are often the most guilty of this, seeing themselves above others and not as equals?
[time=3421] There's a very humble reasoning that's given for this.
[time=3425] It says because you masters know that you also have a master in heaven.
[time=3431] It applies to you who are bosses to remember you have a boss in the Lord.
[time=3443] There's an old Negro spiritual that I love. It says Jesus is my Lord, my Savior and master.
[time=3455] Jesus is my Lord, my Savior and master.
[time=3460] We all have a boss.
[time=3464] We all have a master. It is Jesus Christ.
[time=3469] Paul gives this insight in 1 Corinthians 7, 22.
[time=3474] For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's free man.
[time=3481] And similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave.
[time=3490] You've got to serve somebody.
[time=3493] Can I boil this down to...
[time=3505] Thank you for allowing us to share the inspirational music of our special guest Buddy Green and the compelling message from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3513] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
