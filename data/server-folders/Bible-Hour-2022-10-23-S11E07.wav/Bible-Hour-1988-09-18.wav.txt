[time=90] (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) (silence) Are you disappointed with God?
[time=120] Does he let you down?
[time=122] Perhaps it's your expectations that are in air.
[time=127] Paul W. Powell put it this way.
[time=130] God is far more concerned with our character than he is with our comfort.
[time=135] His goal is not to pamper us physically, but to perfect us spiritually.
[time=142] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hoggs.
[time=157] Thank you for joining us.
[time=158] Rick's message today is entitled "Final Instructions" and is taken from Colossians 4.
[time=165] Today's Christian is often a confused and disappointed believer.
[time=169] He finds himself occasionally at odds with the Lord, feeling that God has let him down.
[time=174] This is our mistake.
[time=176] We come with inappropriate expectations, assuming that the Christian life is a call to increased wealth, assured health, a bounding blessing, and overflowing with comfort.
[time=187] We set ourselves up to be let down.
[time=190] God calls us to be servants and followers, willing to pick up our cross and follow Him.
[time=196] Today's study, we will take a first look at Paul's final instructions to the people of Colossae.
[time=201] Here the great apostle illustrates with his own life and prayer how we must view the Christian
[time=207] life.
[time=208] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study with us.
[time=211] Rick's text is Colossians 4 verses 2 through 6.
[time=217] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=222] Other special music includes a solo from Ed Richard and an instrumental duet from Dave
[time=229] and Debbie Johnson.
[time=232] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=240] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=245] Now here's Rick.
[time=246] We welcome not only you friends who join us here by way of visiting as new people or as
[time=252] families who have been a part of Black Hawk for years, but some friends who join us now by way of television.
[time=258] We trust that God will make His Word come alive in your heart.
[time=263] That you'll have within you today an internal magnetism, a pool that draws you towards Christ.
[time=272] But inside, whether you have the ability on the outside to sing or not, you'll want to give forth a medley of praise to our God.
[time=279] Our choir leads us and expresses that with beauty of music, but within our spirit we can join with them in praising the Lord.
[time=292] I just came to praise the Lord, I just came to praise the Lord, I just came to praise
[time=309] His Holy Name, I just came to praise the Lord.
[time=318] I just came to praise the Lord, I just came to praise the Lord, I just came to praise
[time=333] His Holy Name, I just came to praise the Lord.
[time=340] He has done great things, we have done great things, we have done great things, we have done great things.
[time=359] I just came to praise the Lord, we thank Him for His kindness, we thank Him for His love.
[time=376] We thank Him for His love, we thank Him for His love, we thank Him for His love, we thank
[time=507] I just came to praise the Lord, I will sing of my Redeemer for what He has done for me, number 163, verses 1, 3, and 4, Him number 163.
[time=520] I will sing of my Redeemer and His Father's love to me, on the fruit of the Crosses of
[time=550] my Father, from the First is set me free, sing of sing of my Redeemer with His love,
[time=566] I will sing of my Redeemer with His love, we thank Him for His love, we thank Him for
[time=587] His love, we thank Him for His love, we thank Him for His love, we thank Him for His love
[time=666] what a privilege to proclaim such a statement that Jesus indeed paid the debt and set me free.
[time=673] To continue in music now is that Richard comes to minister to us, that is not usually in front of the camera but behind, and we are thankful today that he not only works in television
[time=683] but as a lovely voice, let's listen as he ministers to us right now.
[time=699] In these walls we join our hearts, we come together to be set apart, but worshiping on
[time=718] Sunday is just a place to hide, if we can't face on Monday the dying world outside,
[time=735] do the crying no we care, do the lonely find us there, are we so involved?
[time=747] We do not hear their call, everywhere men are searching, they're wondering why they're
[time=761] hurting, do they see the love of Jesus at all, outside these walls.
[time=781] Within our hearts He planted a sea, a love we can count on, for all that we need, but
[time=799] safe in our seclusion, how can we grow?
[time=808] When outside these walls are fields we need to sow, do the crying no we care, do the lonely
[time=824] find us there, are we so involved?
[time=830] We do not hear their call, everywhere men are searching, they're wondering why they're
[time=845] hurting, do they see the love of Jesus at all, outside these walls, Lord through our lives,
[time=863] please let others see, your love reflecting through us perfectly, and let the crying
[time=882] no we care, let the lonely find us there, don't be so involved, you do not hear their
[time=895] call, everywhere men are searching, they're wondering why they're hurting, let them see
[time=909] the love of Jesus at all, outside these walls.
[time=939] Hello again and we are delighted that you're joining us today for the Bible hour, Lord
[time=954] willing this is our next to last broadcast from this auditorium.
[time=958] Well, you always have mixed emotions when you realize that you're looking forward to a new building but our convocation center has been very good to us, Rick, and we do love this building too, in many ways it's going to be a bittersweet moment moving to our new sanctuary across the street, we are thankful that God has used this auditorium, it is a
[time=978] multi-purpose gymnasium worship center school cafeteria home for super 60s and we'll still
[time=984] use it in many many ways but we're looking forward to moving in early October to our new worship center, and then in mid-October we're having some very unique dedication services
[time=995] that we want to invite you to be a part of, they begin on Friday night October the 14th.
[time=1002] You know, Rick, last week when we had a special program there were a number of people that said they heard the announcement on the Bible hour for Buddy Green's concert and now we're looking forward as Rick said to October 14th with Nielsen and Young, Avad Young and Steven
[time=1016] Nielsen are both pianists that team up together, they live in different parts of the country but they come together and play magnificent piano music, you'll want to enjoy that, that
[time=1026] begins our weekend of dedication October 14th at 7 p.m.
[time=1031] We do hope that you can join us on the 14th and perhaps back on the 15th when we have Pastor Jeremiah here, David Jeremiah was the founder of the Bible hour and Black Hawk's
[time=1042] first pastor, he is a great Bible teacher and we'll be including in that evening a massive choir that will be singing and praising God and we'd love to have you join us at seven o'clock on October the 15th.
[time=1055] Then the final and formal dedication ceremony is Sunday afternoon at three o'clock October
[time=1061] the 16th.
[time=1062] Many of you probably right now are watching the Olympics and you're seeing up front what's happening in the world of athletics but there's something happening behind the scenes spiritually.
[time=1073] And over two years there's been a coalition of sports ministries that have worked to place chaplains on every Olympic team and the head of that coalition is pastor David Burnham and
[time=1084] he will be back from the Olympics just in time to give the keynote address on Sunday at three o'clock October the 16th.
[time=1092] So we're looking forward to those events and hope that you can join Pete and I and the rest of us here at the Bible hour.
[time=1098] That will be a very exciting weekend.
[time=1100] The building is coming toward completion.
[time=1102] They're working even Saturdays to get everything in position for that day and we're just excited
[time=1108] about it.
[time=1109] Before we go back to our live morning worship service we want to encourage you to write to us today so that we can send you an excellent Bible study tool called a closer walk.
[time=1121] Each of us needs to be walking with the Lord and most of the time we're struggling to keep that walk as close as it ought to be.
[time=1129] There's no substitute for quality time with God in his word and this is a daily Bible
[time=1135] study that will take you through the New Testament in one year and it begins October the first.
[time=1142] So we're encouraging you to write right now and request your copy of A Closer Walk.
[time=1148] We'll be glad to send it to you as a gift from us to you.
[time=1152] You can receive closer walk by writing to the Bible hour 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne,
[time=1158] Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1162] That's the Bible hour 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1170] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today here for the Bible hour.
[time=1188] [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=1310] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1318] There are some real practical ramifications of that blessed assurance that Jesus is mine and the verse that we want to recite for this week we had it for last week is Ephesians 521.
[time=1329] It dwells on some of those practical ramifications of that truth.
[time=1334] If you would stand please as we recite Ephesians 521.
[time=1338] Ephesians 521, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[time=1347] Ephesians 521, thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1352] [MUSIC - 154 seconds]
[time=1531] Thank you, Dave and Debbie. God, we thank you for the beauty and the soothing power and the stringed instruments that calm our spirits soothe our emotions and even soften our wills.
[time=1546] Father, we come to you today as the potter. We put the clay of our lives in your hands and we invite you and we ask you to mold us, to reshape us,
[time=1560] to bend us even at the point of pain, to conform us into the image of your son.
[time=1568] As we come to worship you today, we bring you the gift of our lips, singing your praise, the gift of our resources as we contribute to an offering,
[time=1580] and the devotion of our heart, and the life that we live, we give it as a living sacrifice.
[time=1590] And we ask your forgiveness for the moments, the days, and the prolonged periods of disobedience where we have reneged on our commitment of living as your sacrifice.
[time=1605] So we ask your forgiveness and your cleansing. We ask that you might restore us. I ask you to restore me, Lord.
[time=1614] I pray that as a man and then as a church, we might be ambassadors for Christ, that the next generation in our home or outside would feel the pool from within their own hearts to follow you because they've seen it in us.
[time=1633] We pray for your comfort for Ron King and the death of his brother, Marv Neff and the death of his mother.
[time=1641] For Howard Habig, as he recovers from a heart attack, from others whose hearts are heavy because of strained and broken relationships.
[time=1651] God teach us today to use our time wisely, not for our side, but for your side.
[time=1660] May the ledger be balanced in your favor. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1670] It has been said, occasionally right but usually wrong, that talk is cheap. Most of the time, talk is not cheap.
[time=1683] Warren Wiersby points out that for every word of Adolf Hitler's mine comp, 125 men died. Talk is not cheap.
[time=1697] The poets have long noted that the pen is mightier than the sword and the word sharper than the dagger.
[time=1708] Our words have almost miraculous ability to calm and to soothe and to bring comfort, to heal and to restore.
[time=1717] They have an even quicker ability to destroy and to pull down and uproot in the main.
[time=1723] No talk is not cheap. Words are important.
[time=1729] As we conclude our study in the book of Colossians, we have Paul's final instructions which focus on our use of words.
[time=1740] If you have a Bible, I invite you to open it to Colossians chapter 4 and verses 2 through 6 give us the perimeter of our study today.
[time=1752] Colossians is a book that bears its name because it was penned by Paul an apostle under the inspiration of God to a city called Colossi, hence the title Colossians.
[time=1767] Chapter 4 verse 2, "Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. Pray for us too that God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains."
[time=1795] Pray that I may proclaim it clearly as I should.
[time=1802] Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders. Make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace.
[time=1818] Season with salt so that you may know how to answer everyone.
[time=1827] These are noted as Paul's final instructions, final because we're coming to the close of this correspondence. These are amongst his last few commands in a book that is filled with imperatives.
[time=1842] But it's final in that it is perhaps and probably in Paul's estimation at the time of his writing his final correspondence.
[time=1854] He has been charged with a capital offense and he has been found guilty. He had appealed it from Festus to Felix, from Felix to a gripper and now he has shouted out, "I appeal to Caesar."
[time=1868] He is in Rome waiting that appeal. In all likelihood he will die. He will not return back to Asia, to Ephesus, to Colossi, to Laodicea.
[time=1883] He may never write again. This book is a final instruction from a man who would have his life lived for Christ and who would have his final words to these people.
[time=1900] He uses it an opportunity to equip them, to challenge them in their use of words. There are two central instructions here. One, be persistent in praying, a keen use of words, and be winsome in witnessing.
[time=1921] Verse two, devote yourselves to prayer. That's where we get the central theme of being persistent in prayer. Prayer is the neglected resource, the power for ministry. Whether you stand behind a pulpit or you work with a wrench.
[time=1938] Whether your office is your home or your home is your office. Prayer has great power to bring about significant ministry.
[time=1949] One of the greatest preachers of the English speaking world, if not the greatest of all times, was a young man by the name of Charles Haddon Spurgeon.
[time=1959] By the time he was 20 years old, all of London had his name on their lips. He was nearly a novelty in his own day as a teenager.
[time=1969] And people literally by the thousands and thousands would come here, young Charles Haddon Spurgeon preached the gospel. He was a man of genuine humility. He never feigned at once.
[time=1983] When the thousands would come to hear him speak, there would be those who would gather on another day to investigate and then ask, "What is the secret of your success? What is the power of your preaching?"
[time=1997] He would take them into London tabernacle and they would see a multi-thousand seat auditorium where the audience would crowd to hear him speak.
[time=2007] And then he would take him downstairs to a smaller room, large but yet smaller. He would say, "The power of our preaching is in this room.
[time=2016] For every time I am up there preaching, hundreds are down here praying, and that is the power of the ministry."
[time=2026] James tells us in James chapter 4, "You have not simply because you ask not."
[time=2035] Here's Paul's final instructions, and he says, "Devote yourselves the praying." He even gives a little insight how to do that, two descriptions, watchfully and thankfully.
[time=2048] There's almost a mutual exclusiveness in our society between being prayerful and being watchful.
[time=2054] It's nowhere in the Bible where we've developed our motif of praying.
[time=2058] You fold your hands, guaranteed they'll do nothing.
[time=2062] You bow your head and you close your eyes, and then you resist the urge to fall asleep.
[time=2070] And it's almost paradoxical that the Bible says, "Be watchful." Some of you are offended when somebody says, "I drive and pray at the same time."
[time=2080] I've seen the way some of you drive and you ought to be praying as you drive.
[time=2084] It sounds very appropriate.
[time=2088] Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, "Watch" and "pray"?
[time=2093] What did he mean by that?
[time=2095] Well, the word "watch" is the word be vigilant.
[time=2098] Be alert.
[time=2100] Be sober-minded and conscious of what you're doing.
[time=2106] How can we be watchful and prayerful at the same time?
[time=2111] Well, let me give you three suggestions of my own.
[time=2114] I can't say these come out of a phrase out of Colossians 4, just a little homespun insight.
[time=2120] I hope that will help.
[time=2122] To be watchful and prayerful, I think these three things help me.
[time=2126] Perhaps they'll help you know what you're praying about.
[time=2130] These are the type of prayers that if they are of any value, it has to be minimal.
[time=2136] God bless the missionaries, one and all.
[time=2142] To be watchful and prayer means to be involved watching and observing and seeing
[time=2148] and knowing what is the need in Bangladesh after monsoons have enveloped the country.
[time=2155] That's being watchful.
[time=2157] What are the needs in Jamaica as an island has been pummeled by the worst hurricane in its history?
[time=2163] What are the needs of Dave and Eve Southwell in Portugal?
[time=2169] That's being watchful.
[time=2171] What are the needs of that elderly couple across the street?
[time=2175] That's being watchful.
[time=2177] What is the need of my boss?
[time=2180] That's being watchful.
[time=2182] And when we watchfully pray, we pray knowing the need for which we're praying.
[time=2189] Secondly, it's knowing the answers to our previous prayers.
[time=2196] There is a fine, fine organization that I commend to you called Christian Business Men's Committee.
[time=2203] They have a little card that we use here called a 10 most wanted list to be blunt.
[time=2208] They want we stole it from them.
[time=2211] They stole it from the FBI and they're the ones that need to worry.
[time=2214] A 10 most wanted list is a card that you just give you numbers 1 through 10, and you write down the name of people who don't know Christ, where you want to be reminded to pray for them regularly.
[time=2228] And I remember filling out a 10 most wanted list.
[time=2231] I've done it dozens of times and I lose those things.
[time=2235] I was rummaging through a stack of things and I came across an old 10 most wanted list.
[time=2240] It wasn't filled out.
[time=2241] There were only seven or eight names.
[time=2243] It had been years since I had filled that one out and I looked down the cross and when we hold the first name was my grandfather.
[time=2251] He'd come to Christ.
[time=2253] Joe, your name, was on that list.
[time=2256] Joe's given his heart to Christ.
[time=2257] Norm, your name was on that list.
[time=2259] He's given his heart to Christ.
[time=2261] And suddenly there came to my heart a realization that if I was really watchful in my praying, I'd spend a whole lot more time seeing how God answered than generating the next list of requests.
[time=2274] That's being watchful.
[time=2276] Knowing when God has answered those prayers.
[time=2280] Third thing that helps me to be watchful is this.
[time=2285] To answer as many of my own requests as possible.
[time=2290] Has it ever happened to you that you're praying and you're saying, God, would you please, in half way through the prayer, the spirit of God in your own hearts
[time=2299] isn't maybe I ought to stop asking God to do it and do it myself.
[time=2305] How many times do we ask God to do things when the Holy Spirit's tapping us and the children saying you'd be a fine lady to do that?
[time=2314] You're the man that I had in mind.
[time=2317] So many times we say, God sends somebody to comfort that lonely widow.
[time=2322] Why not you?
[time=2324] Why not me?
[time=2326] That's being watchful in our praying.
[time=2330] It's observing the opportunities around us.
[time=2333] If your prayer life is boring, it may because you're getting a direct return on your investment.
[time=2342] Nothing in, you get nothing out.
[time=2345] It may sound simple, but take a piece of paper, fold it in half, and start your prayer request on the left side and then start watching for God to answer them.
[time=2356] And that'll lead you into the second way that this passage says to pray.
[time=2361] It says pray, thankfully.
[time=2364] Our prayer ought to be more of a Thanksgiving service than a Christmas wish list.
[time=2370] Any of you have children can recognize this one.
[time=2374] My grandmother made the mistake of setting a Sears and Robux catalog in front of one of her grandchildren.
[time=2381] I'm proud to say it was not this one.
[time=2385] And she said, honey, what is it you would like thinking he would point to the one or two things that he would like?
[time=2392] He took the Sears and Robux catalog.
[time=2395] The little one could not read, but he could find the toy section with amazing speed.
[time=2401] He took a crayon and he began the circle, everything he wanted.
[time=2404] He averaged less than one item per page, uncircled.
[time=2410] And that, my friends, is too much like most of our prayer lists, including mine.
[time=2417] I think God is more excited about Thanksgiving than he is about Christmas, particularly in our prayer life.
[time=2425] Can I give you two reasons why it is good for us to be thankful?
[time=2430] First of all, it pleases God.
[time=2433] You know, God says, ask me anything, but don't forget to thank me.
[time=2438] That's basically Philippians 4.
[time=2440] Gratitude is a fleeting quality in the character of America.
[time=2445] We only want more.
[time=2447] We know how to say may I, but not thank you.
[time=2451] I have to believe that God is more pleased with our gratitude than our grabbing.
[time=2458] The other night, a step of maturity took place at the Hawks household for which I am deeply grateful.
[time=2466] It even has me believing that God is still on his throne.
[time=2471] We're out in the front yard.
[time=2473] One daughter's bike has a flat tire and so we're taking it apart and swatting mosquitoes and trying to pump up the tire and just got the job finished.
[time=2481] And another daughter came over and said, "Dad, I wanted to ask you to get my bike down." But I was thankful that you were helping Rachel, so I thought I would wait.
[time=2491] I looked up into heaven because this was the same daughter who a couple of years ago,
[time=2499] after her second trip in one week to Disney World, riding in the back seat of the car,
[time=2506] nearly exhausted from 12 hours of rides and thrills and spills and tumbles and turns
[time=2513] and says, "Dad, can we go to McDonald's?" and I said, "No, not tonight." Folded her arms and said, "We never get to do nothing around here." (Laughter) And suddenly this little girl says, "Dad, I was thankful you were helping Rachel." And I thought I'd wait.
[time=2531] And I have to believe that it pleases God when I come to prayer and instead of going, "One," I say, "God, I am so grateful. I'm so grateful for a wife who is a partner in life
[time=2545] who shoulders those burdens and encourages.
[time=2549] I'm thankful for children who at their young age are tender towards you.
[time=2554] God, I'm thankful for a church. We're thankful for a gymnasium that's been home and many of you have come to Christ in this place. God, I'm thankful.
[time=2564] God, I'm thankful for a new building where we won't dribble.
[time=2569] Gratitude. Oh, it pleases the father. Can I give you a second reason?
[time=2573] It's therapeutic. It's therapeutic.
[time=2577] Most of us are bored with life because we've never learned to appreciate what we have
[time=2583] and we have placed our happiness in the next acquisition.
[time=2588] No matter how many more come, there is still a next acquisition.
[time=2595] Hope deferred makes the heart sick.
[time=2598] And if you live always in hope of more, you will always live and defeat.
[time=2605] Gratitude is one of the great, great therapies of life.
[time=2611] It is so simple that you feel it's trite, but it is not.
[time=2617] An old Christian course may be the cure for most of your depression today.
[time=2622] Count your many blessings, name them one by one.
[time=2626] Count your many blessings and see what God has done.
[time=2630] Let me suggest this simple therapy for you.
[time=2633] The next time you're down in discouraged, take another piece of paper, fold it in half. Right on the left-hand side, everything that has you down and discouraged. And then on the right-hand side, name five things opposite it for which you can give thanks.
[time=2651] And suddenly, there will be great cause for rejoicing.
[time=2658] Being persistent in prayer. But Paul not only teaches it, he models it.
[time=2665] Look at verse three. Pray for us too. Aha, now is Paul going to be watchful?
[time=2672] Is he going to be thankful? Or is he going to be a grubber just like the rest of us?
[time=2677] Pray for us too that God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim
[time=2683] the mystery of Christ for which I am in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it clearly as I should. It's probably worth noting what Paul does not pray for.
[time=2694] Notice here's a man on death row and he doesn't pray for release.
[time=2698] He doesn't pray for a successful trial. He doesn't pray for needed rest and relaxation.
[time=2705] Instead, he prays for two things. He prays for opportunity.
[time=2710] And he prays for effectiveness. He talked about a man being watched for in prayer.
[time=2715] He's here in prison and he says being watchful leads me to say, this is an opportunity. Pray not that the doors of prison will be open,
[time=2724] but pray that the doors of ministry will be open. And then when they are open, pray that I'll be found effective. Was Paul effective? Oh, you bet he was.
[time=2733] Philippians tells us how effective he was. These are parallel epistles written at the same time.
[time=2739] Philippians chapter 1 verse 12 tells us Paul says, Now I want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has already served to advance the gospel.
[time=2750] Paul said, yes, I'm in prison, but I had a purpose. It advances the gospel.
[time=2756] That was an opportunity. Was he effective? Chapter 4. Paul says.
[time=2764] In chapter 4 verse 22, all the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household.
[time=2775] They're called the Praetorian guards. Those men who were shackled, manicled, the Paul every day were a captive opportunity.
[time=2784] And he was effective because now they're numbered in the saints.
[time=2788] I say this with deep admiration. One of the men in our church never misses an opportunity for Christ. He is an outspoken evangelist for Christ.
[time=2800] We were in Jamaica together. A man pulled up in a boat while we were walking and he commandeered the boat and began witnessing to the guy.
[time=2807] He led three of the people who worked in the quaint motel in which we stayed to the Lord.
[time=2812] As we were leaving the country to go from Mondeville to Kingston, it's about a two and a half hour ride.
[time=2818] And there were two Jamaicans driving a truck with supplies and luggage and we didn't have enough room on the bus. So I asked this man if he would ride in the truck and he said, "Sure I will." The bus is heading down the road and the truck is behind us.
[time=2833] And here's this short little American squish between these two Jamaicans.
[time=2837] You can't hear a word, but you can see what's taking place.
[time=2844] For two and a half hours, these two Jamaicans had the gospel of Jesus Christ given to them why they were a captive audience. And he just, two and a half hours, "You know Jesus Christ? Did you know if you were to die? And he just gave it to him." Couldn't you imagine being shackled with the Apostle Paul? Who's the prisoner in that setting?
[time=2863] That's taking adversity and turning it into an opportunity and being found effective.
[time=2871] Paul modeled everything that he prayed for.
[time=2875] We're given opportunities. We often avoid them when we should be embracing them.
[time=2882] We're too concerned about our comfort.
[time=2885] Listen to the words of Paul W. O. Powell.
[time=2889] "God is more concerned with our character than he is our comfort.
[time=2895] His goal is not to pamper us physically, but to perfect us spiritually."
[time=2903] And for that, we pray for opportunities and effectiveness.
[time=2908] And we're to be persistent in prayer.
[time=2911] Paul's second instruction comes about in verses five and six.
[time=2916] I've labeled it being "winsome" in witnessing.
[time=2920] It says, "Be wise in the way you act towards outsiders." We're not trying to make this a club.
[time=2927] Paul's simply noticing that there are those who are inside the family of God.
[time=2932] And there are those who've never given their heart to Christ who are outside.
[time=2936] Now he says, "Walk, order your life in such a way that it's marked with wisdom
[time=2943] so that it affects positively those who are outside of Christ." There was a pastor by the name of Dr. Houghton, who later became president of Moody Bible Institute.
[time=2955] While he lived and pastored in Atlanta, Georgia, somebody on the outside hired a private detective to follow him and conduct surveillance on his life, to find his Achilles heel, the catch him, and to find him in the fault.
[time=2976] Houghton never knew of the investigator, but the investigator knew of Houghton.
[time=2982] And before his investigation was completed, the private eye left the outside
[time=2989] and became an insider and gave his life to Christ because of the walk of Dr. Houghton.
[time=2997] That's walking in wisdom.
[time=3000] It gives us two descriptions of how to walk in wisdom.
[time=3004] The first is this one, "Make the most of every opportunity." I remember John Such when he was our youth pastor.
[time=3011] He now pastors at Wallen Baptist Church.
[time=3014] Speaking on a parallel passage in Ephesians 5 where it says the same thing, "Redeeming the time." John wisely noted and illustrated that in the Greek language, there are two words for time.
[time=3026] There's the more common word, which is chronos, from which we get chronology, and it speaks of time in its minutes and hours, its days and its years, as a sequence of time.
[time=3037] But there's a second word that speaks of an event that knows no specific duration.
[time=3044] John illustrated it this way.
[time=3046] In basketball, you're playing on a time clock, and whereas the time ticks its way down, the game ends.
[time=3054] Regardless of the score or who has the ball, it's over.
[time=3059] But baseball is not that way.
[time=3061] In baseball, you're offered nine opportunities, called innings.
[time=3067] They may be as short as three up and three down, or as long as eternity if you're the pitcher, giving up singles and doubles and triples like the guy selling peanuts in the stand.
[time=3080] It knows no definition of minutes or hours, but only opportunities.
[time=3086] Here the apostle Paul says that we need to seize opportunities as they are presented to us.
[time=3095] Part of our watchfulness, perhaps, is seizing the opportunities.
[time=3101] 1 Peter, chapter 3, verse 15, many of you have memorized.
[time=3106] It says this, "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give answer to every man that asks you for a reason for the hope that's within you." Now with the show of hands this morning, how many of you have ever had somebody come up to you and say, "Could you give me a reason for the hope that's within you?" Doesn't happen like that, does it?
[time=3132] Hasn't happened to me either.
[time=3135] But yet it has.
[time=3137] It's happened to me and to you.
[time=3140] No, they don't come up and ask that question, but they come up and they say things like, "Ever since my wife died, I'm so lonely."
[time=3151] What they're saying is what Ed Richards saying this morning, "Do you really care about me? Could you help me?
[time=3159] Could you spend time with me?" You see, when they start hearing the music, that's when they want to know the words.
[time=3167] Well, they come up and say, "I don't know what to do.
[time=3171] My son has broken my heart. I don't know what to do."
[time=3177] That's not a plea for information, by the way.
[time=3180] It's a plea for empathy.
[time=3183] It's not somebody who wants a piece of notebook paper lined with facts, but a piece of tissue paper to absorb tears.
[time=3192] They're asking. They're just disguising it in the form of a need.
[time=3200] Our words are important, and we must seize the time.
[time=3205] And secondly, to be a winsome witness, you know, we must seize the time, but you must season the occasion.
[time=3214] Verse 6 says, "Let your conversation always be full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer every man." It says here that our words are important, but they have to be rightly seasoned, seasoned with two things, grace and salt.
[time=3231] Can we use the word for grace here?
[time=3234] Call it charm.
[time=3235] Allow me to quote Swindall, who quotes Reinhold Nebor.
[time=3240] "You may be able to compel people," says Nebor, "to maintain certain minimal standards by stressing duty.
[time=3249] But the highest moral and spiritual achievements depend not only on a push,
[time=3255] but a pool.
[time=3257] People must be charmed in their righteousness," Swindall adds.
[time=3263] When will today's church ever learn this?
[time=3266] How much longer must we rely on pushing and demanding?
[time=3272] What will it take to bring back the charm that marvelous grace
[time=3278] that draws righteousness out of us like iron shavings to a massive magnet?
[time=3284] Our speech.
[time=3285] Is it gracious?
[time=3287] Is it charming and compelling?
[time=3290] And then secondly, is it seasoned with salt?
[time=3292] No small theological debate over what the word salt means.
[time=3296] I take it at its simplest meaning.
[time=3298] Salt is the spice.
[time=3300] It's the zest.
[time=3301] If you're like me, a french fry is an occasion to have salt.
[time=3306] It's just like if you're going to have coffee, you have to have a mug to hold it in.
[time=3309] If you're going to have to have salt, you have to have a french fry to hold it on.
[time=3313] I'm not into potatoes without salt.
[time=3316] With them, I think they're great.
[time=3319] The problem with Christianity is we've lost our salt, our zest, our taste,
[time=3325] our liveliness.
[time=3327] Berkeley put it this way, "It is true true that Christianity is connected with a kind of sanctimonious dullness and an out which in which laughter is a form of heresy."
[time=3340] Spurgeon, who I informed you of earlier, was a man who was accused often of being frivolous
[time=3346] because he not only used humor in his messages, but he had break out laughing at himself on top of it all.
[time=3353] Spurgeon's response was, "If you knew how often I contained myself, you would commend me." J. Oswald Sanders is one worth quoting.
[time=3364] He says, "This preacher thinks it is less a crime to cause a moment of laughter than
[time=3370] to present one half hour of uninterrupted slumber." Christianity, we've become dull.
[time=3378] We've become focused on what we don't do.
[time=3381] Most people don't go to church.
[time=3384] Bill Hybels in Chicago spent four weeks of his life, eight hours a day, six days a week asking people, "Why don't you go to church?" And they said, "Because it's boring." Mark Twain said that 140 years ago, or he staged it 140 years ago, and Huckleberry Finn,
[time=3403] he put these words in Huck's mouth, all read it as Huck would say it.
[time=3407] So I slipped out, and I slid up the road, and there weren't nobody at church except for
[time=3414] a hog or two, for the door weren't locked.
[time=3417] And hogs like a slatted floor in the summertime because it's cool.
[time=3422] If you notice, most folks don't go to church except when they have to, but a hog is different.
[time=3432] What's Mark Twain saying?
[time=3434] He's saying, "The reality of our society is we look at church and we say, "Oh, do I have to go?" Why?
[time=3441] Because church and preachers and musicians and most of all Christians are boring, and they're
[time=3449] dull.
[time=3450] We've lost our charm, and we've lost our salt.
[time=3456] Our speech is bland and usually demanding.
[time=3462] There's no pool, there's only push.
[time=3468] Words are important, and we must learn to seize the opportunity, and then to season the occasion.
[time=3482] Hogs are smarter than people.
[time=3485] They show up even when they don't have to.
[time=3489] As Christians, how we present Christ is not a matter of Madison Avenue technology and advertising,
[time=3496] but it is a matter of being winsome and charming and gracious.
[time=3503] If we lose that, we lose the next generation.
[time=3524] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our musicians, Ed Richard, an instrumentalist, Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=3536] The message today was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3540] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to pray this prayer with you right now.
[time=3547] Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=3550] Dear Heavenly Father, how I thank you that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross
[time=3556] and come into my heart and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3560] I ask you to do that today.
[time=3562] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3566] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us of your decision?
[time=3570] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3578] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Closer Walk",
[time=3584] write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3591] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1361,
[time=3597] or use the sermon title "Final Instructions".
[time=3600] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3615] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3619] Perhaps you've thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3623] Why not do it today?
[time=3624] I know it would be an encouragement to Pastor Rick and the entire Bible hour staff.
