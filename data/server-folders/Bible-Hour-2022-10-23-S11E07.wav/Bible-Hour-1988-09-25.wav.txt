[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] Over the years, friendship has been given many definitions.
[time=107] There are several that I like.
[time=109] One man put it this way.
[time=111] A friend is someone who understands my silence.
[time=116] A one I even like better is this.
[time=118] A friend is one who comes in when the whole world is going out, but perhaps the best definition
[time=126] of all is the word for friend of the vocabulary of the American Indian.
[time=131] They do not have one little word like our word friend.
[time=135] Their word for friend is this.
[time=137] One who carries my burdens on his back.
[time=143] As we come to the end of Colossians, we meet Paul's list of friends and we discover what it is that makes a lifetime of being friends.
[time=166] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=171] Thank you for joining us.
[time=173] Today Rick is continuing his series from the book of Colossians with a message he has entitled A Lifetime of Friends.
[time=180] A friend is someone who comes in when the whole world is going out, says an old English proverb.
[time=186] Colossians ends with Paul paying tribute to a lifetime of friends.
[time=190] In these concluding verses, we meet men and women who are sent and went.
[time=195] Others who stayed, some who prayed and tragically one who strayed.
[time=201] These were people who make themselves vulnerable.
[time=203] They were risk takers, gamblers of a sort.
[time=206] They were weary but refused to quit.
[time=209] They erred but repaid.
[time=211] They missed but rebounded.
[time=213] They lived for us friendship at its finest.
[time=217] Study with us today, a lifetime of being friends.
[time=221] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=225] Rick's text is Colossians chapter 4 verse 7 through the end of the chapter.
[time=230] Our special music includes a song from the sanctuary choir.
[time=235] Rejoice.
[time=237] And a solo from Lynn Roll.
[time=242] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=251] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=255] Now here's Rick.
[time=257] We're delighted to welcome you to our morning worship service.
[time=261] You friends who have joined us in person and also our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=267] We trust that God will use this hour to build our faith in Christ, to strengthen us in our walk and to build us up in our faith.
[time=275] Thank you for worshiping with us this morning.
[time=295] [MUSIC - 197 seconds]
[time=502] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 105 seconds]
[time=614] We appreciate that when you join in and sing a song like that with such a great testimony.
[time=619] Continue our music now.
[time=621] We appreciate the ministry of our various groups that are working hard each week to present music that honors the Lord, proclaims the name of the Lord.
[time=631] Rejoice is coming to sing now a song that's entitled "Proclaim the Glory of the Lord." Let's listen to them as they sing for us right now.
[time=640] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] And messy rains have dealt his name in praises [MUSIC] Forever the way, the glory of the Lord [MUSIC] Make known as mighty deeds do want to come [MUSIC] And call it every nation known [MUSIC] This our Messiah, our Savior and our King [MUSIC] Let all our voices join us one and two [MUSIC] We are for singing, one to our call [MUSIC] His greatness we uphold [MUSIC] Let every place on every shore [MUSIC] Proclaim the glory of the Lord [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[time=714] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=795] Joining Pete and myself here on this set,
[time=803] as we talk with you friends, is our friend George Lantman, one of the pastors of our staff.
[time=808] Good morning, George and Pete.
[time=810] Good morning, Rick.
[time=811] Good morning, Pete.
[time=812] Good morning, George.
[time=813] It's always good to be surrounded by friends.
[time=816] We've asked George to join us today so that he could tell you about a great ministry that goes on week by week, and that, of course, is super sixties, but the anniversary and the 10th anniversary is coming up very quickly.
[time=828] When is the celebration?
[time=830] Well, it's on October the 7th, 10 o'clock in the morning.
[time=833] I'm looking forward to that and you have some very special guests coming.
[time=837] Yes, we do.
[time=838] We invite the President of the United States.
[time=840] We don't know if he'll come or not, but invite him.
[time=842] Well, you invite him, but I'll hold my breath in just in case.
[time=846] But who is your special guest speaker or music for the day?
[time=850] Our special guests on the program are Rod and Carolyn Patti, and they have a great ministry, and I'm sure they're going to bless our hearts.
[time=858] Well, I'm looking forward to that.
[time=860] Many of you know the name Sandy Patti, and she learned much of her great ability through her mother and father who can sing.
[time=867] If I can say this equally as well.
[time=869] Yes, in fact, I think I'll write a letter to them and ask them to bring along their daughter if they would like to.
[time=873] I bet they get a few invitations just like that one.
[time=876] But Rick, I would like to invite all the people, all the senior adults in the community to come out on October the 7th and 10 o'clock and enjoy this great program.
[time=885] And we meet each Friday, too.
[time=887] We have a varied program each Friday, which they could attend.
[time=890] You know, George makes a good point.
[time=892] We come to you with this anniversary special and do want you to come on Friday, October the 7th at 10 in the morning.
[time=899] But each Friday we have super 60s here in a variety of programs lunch.
[time=904] It's a great morning.
[time=905] Yes.
[time=906] And George, you provide a ministry along with that of transportation.
[time=910] And if these friends can't come on their own accord, how can you provide help?
[time=915] Well, we can have them call in 4937400 and then just tell us the need transportation and we'll provide that.
[time=924] Well, that's great.
[time=925] And we do want to encourage you senior adult friends to join us for the 10th anniversary of super 60s on Friday morning, October the 7th at 10 a.m.
[time=935] And again, if you do need transportation, you can just call here at the Church Monday through Friday and we'll be glad to help you get here for the 10th anniversary.
[time=944] Now, we have a videotape of the construction of our new sanctuary, which we're planning on moving into on October the 9th.
[time=953] And while we're looking at that, Pete has an invitation for you.
[time=957] The building is coming to completion and we're very excited about that and would like to invite all of you to the dedication services on the weekend of October 14th, 15th and 16th.
[time=968] On Friday evening, October 15th, we'll have Nielsen and Young, Jill Pianas coming to share with us their ministry in music and by way of
[time=978] instrumental music on the pianos.
[time=980] That'll be a very unique evening at 730 October 14th.
[time=985] Then on Saturday evening, October 15th, we will have with us our former pastor, Dr. David Jeremiah, who is now from San Diego, California.
[time=994] He'll be with us at 730.
[time=996] The choir will be singing and there'll be special music for that night.
[time=1000] Then at 3 o'clock on Sunday afternoon will be our formal dedication service with Dr. David Burnham.
[time=1006] Dr. David Burnham is from the Ohio area and was instrumental in leading our pastor to the Lord.
[time=1012] He's right now in Seoul, Korea, working with the Olympians and helping them with Bible studies.
[time=1018] He'll be just returning from Seoul and he'll have an exciting ministry with us.
[time=1022] Again, that weekend is October 14th, 15th and 16th.
[time=1027] Thank you, Pete, and as you're looking at the videotape, you're seeing a lot of highly technical equipment that I couldn't begin to explain to you.
[time=1035] But that is the backbone of the television ministry.
[time=1039] This is the control room and the electronic parts you were looking at are what makes all that we do here in the sanctuary come over the airwaves to you.
[time=1048] A lot of work is yet to be done, but October the 9th is coming and we believe we'll make that date with even maybe a day or two to spare.
[time=1057] Under the cross of the new building will be a round stained glass window with an open Bible.
[time=1065] The ministry of this church and its television program is to share the Lord Jesus Christ by opening up the scriptures.
[time=1072] We want to thank you for joining us here for the Bible Hour today and before we depart, invite you to write in for an excellent Bible study tool so that you can have more than just this hour of attention to God's word.
[time=1085] If you want to have a closer walk with God, you'll have to invest in that, not financially, but in time in his word.
[time=1093] And so we offer to you a pamphlet entitled "A Closer Walk." It's a daily Bible study guide that will take you through the New Testament in one year's time period. And we want to encourage you to write for it right now as we begin the month of October, we begin with the Book of Matthew and our year of Bible study is upon us.
[time=1113] So please do write today, write to us at the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. Thank you again for joining us today here for the Bible Hour.
[time=1129] [MUSIC - 264 seconds]
[time=1397] Thank you, Lynn. As we meet today, we may meet with great confidence and expectation of self, but beneath that exterior, there is the inner reality that we are not perfect, and we need a Savior, one who is. And Lord Jesus, we come to you today to worship you, and we ask today for your strength, for your forgiveness that you would cover our sins and our shortcomings blot them out of your sight and even ours.
[time=1433] We come to you today to worship you, and yet we know that we are inadequate and incapable of even doing that unless your spirit helps us. God, we ask you to make your word come alive today, to make this service ring forth with a sense of vibrancy to give meaning and purpose to what we do day by day. May it spring out of this hour of worship. Father, today there are many who are lonely. We think particularly of Mary Heybig and the death of her partner. We think of those who have gone through the agony of a divorce we think of young men who long for a father to say, "I love you." Of young girls who are desperately seeking male attention because they've not found it at home. We pray today for those men who are walking through life without any sense of friendship. For those ladies who feel companionless, that you would bring into our lives these skills spiritually and socially to make friends, to build relationships, but most of all God, we want to build our relationship with you.
[time=1521] So as we meet today, help us to discover your word that we might know you and that we might from knowing you know how to love and to care for people in Jesus name.
[time=1537] [AMEN] History is rarely fair.
[time=1545] One if by land and two if by sea and I on the opposite shore shall be. How many of us know those classic words that bring to our ears the famous Midnight Ride of Paul Revere? There's not anyone who's grown up in this country that doesn't know of the great Paul Revere and I'm sure all of you know too about Billy Dawes.
[time=1569] Who on earth is Billy Dawes? Well William Dawes made the identical journey that Paul Revere made.
[time=1577] Paul Revere did not single handedly born every colony that the British were coming. There were several others who made a similar ride, but history has not recorded their names.
[time=1589] History is rarely fair.
[time=1593] Many of you are football fans, perhaps most of you, and I'm sure you all remember the names of Jackson and Wooten, Shaftrath and Clark.
[time=1605] Except for a few of us die hard buck eyes, those are names that have been obscured by time.
[time=1609] But you all do well remember the great Jim Brown who ran for more yards in less games than any man until Walter Payton. And I'd still contend that Brown was the better runner. Well who were Wooten and Hickerson and Monty Clark and Dick Shaftrath. Well those were the four guys that threw all the blocks that sprung them loose on a career of running.
[time=1637] But history doesn't record those names either.
[time=1641] And who is justice and archipice and Aristarchus?
[time=1645] Who was Taikias? Obscure names but real men and women who had an impact for Jesus Christ. Who were to Paul?
[time=1657] His blockers. His co-writers on his midnight journeys. His fellow ambassadors.
[time=1665] And I'm thankful they're not obscured by history but their name merits inclusion in the book of life and in our study today. If you have a Bible I invite you to open it to Colossians chapter 4 and this is Paul's final words to Colossae. We look last week at his final instructions.
[time=1685] These are his final greetings. And in these pages we meet people. People who have been obscured by time almost ignored by history but worthy of our attention today.
[time=1701] Chapter 4 verse 7. Taikias will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother a faithful minister and a fellow servant in the Lord. I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
[time=1725] He is coming with Onesimus. Our faithful and dear brother who is one of you they will tell you everything that is happening here.
[time=1737] My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas.
[time=1745] You have received instructions about him. If he comes to you welcome him. Jesus who is called justice also sends greetings.
[time=1757] These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God and they have proved a comfort to me a paphorous who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus sends greetings he is always wrestling in prayer for you that you may stand firm in all the will of God mature and fully assured. I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea who are very helpless. Our dear friend Luke the doctor and Demas send greetings give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea and Tanimfa and the church in her house after this letter has been read to you see that it is also read in the church of Laodicea and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea to it that you complete the work you have received in the Lord I, Paul write this greeting in my own hand remember my chains grace be with you well this is a passage of scripture that we are prone to ignore it's like one of the genealogies of the Old Testament one name that you can't pronounce and it goes on for chapter after chapter and as you read through the Bible you say Lord why did you include this and sometimes we come to these closing verses of a new Testament epistle and it kind of reads like well this was for those people back then but it's not for us today but as I've studied I've found this passage to be alive and to be vibrant and it's challenged me to be a friend for lifetime and to make a lifetime of friends these names represent 11 who dared these are daring men and women vulnerable risk takers in many ways they took the dice in their hands and they rolled their life on the table for Christ and they held no bets back they risked it all I'm refreshed and I'm challenged just by the reading of their names I would like to share each of their names with you and then a simple description and elaboration on each of these 11 who dared the first man's name is found in verse 7 Tychicus his name means of something beyond fortunate more like fortuitous we don't know a great deal about this man but listen to this description he will tell you the news about me he is one a dear brother to a faithful minister and three a fellow servant in the Lord if you had to quit that is a great description wouldn't it be great if at the end of your life your friends gathered around and said we are going to miss him we will mourn her departure because he or she is a dear brother or sister he was a fellow servant in the Lord and a faithful one but a little bit more insights available on this man in the next verse it says I am sending him to you that little phrase I am sending him to you is almost the greatest description of his life because he's not only being sent here but every time you meet this guy in scripture he is on his way somewhere I am going to call him the one who was sent here in Colossians it says that he is sending him to the people of Colossae he is presently with Paul in Rome he is going to be sent at the end of Philemon it parallels this and it says he is going to be sent in Ephesians it says he is going to be sent in Ephesians chapter 20 he was with Paul in a different location and he says I am going to send him to Troas Titus is told I am going to send him to you Timothy is told I am going to send him to you this man may have been the predecessor of Federal Express and the precursor of the Pony Express he was always going somewhere carrying the mail but he was doing more than carrying the mail he was representing the apostle Paul as he was an ambassador for Christ. Newt Rockney stood on the sidelines of Notre Dame and he looked at these strong blocking men but he didn't have a back and he walked up and down the sidelines he says what we need on this team we need just one kid who can carry the mail just one as the Newt Rockney would walk up and down the sidelines he would mutter we need a kid who can carry the mail he looked over in the sidelines and there were just some guys playing football they weren't him on the team there was this kid who kicked the football like Newt Rock he had never seen a football kick before and he looked at his legs and he said that kid can carry the mail called the young boy over and he said have you ever played any formal football and the young boy said no never have he said would you like to try dressed him up gave him the ball and George Gipp ran like nobody has ever run in the history of Notre Dame they needed a guy who could carry the mail the apostle Paul has a guy who can carry the mail and his name fortuitous it's beyond fortunate which means a happenstance fortuitous means planned timely almost determined there needed to be somebody faithful who could extend the outreach of the gospel beyond Paul's hands someone
[time=2135] who would go someone who could be sent and every time we meet this man in the scripture
[time=2141] he was someone who could be sent is your life available to God if God wanted to send you across the ocean are you ready to go God needs to send you across the street are you ready to go if God needs you to carry a Sunday school lesson into a four year old class are you ready to go if God needs to send you with a table under this arm and a chair under this arm to a super sixth of these anniversary are you ready to go if God needs to send you across the street to clean out a building are you ready to go if God needs to send you three offices down and across the hall to invite a businessman to a CBMC lunch are you ready to go Paul had a man who could be sent he was fortuitous he was ready to go he's like that athlete on the basketball court who always seems to pick up the loose balls it's not an accident that he was in the right place at the right time he had the right instincts in the right disposition this man was one who was sent verse nine he is coming with Onesimus may I call him the one who returned are faithful and dear brother who is one of you they will tell you of everything that is happening here Onesimus returns he says he is one of you that meant he was from Colossae or that general part of the country they would know of him they would know his name he was a part of them he's been with Paul and now he returns but his return will be a difficult one for you see Onesimus is the character central to the theme of the book Philemon he is a slave a runaway slave he has run away from Philemon he has found his way to Rome he's been exposed to Christians and now in contact with Paul and he gives his life to Christ and now what does a runaway slave do who's come to Christ Paul says Onesimus he returned you know the hardest thing to do in life is to return to the old place as a new person it's easier just to keep going to cut off the past and say it's over and I'll just face the future and sometimes God says we need to return to make the past right a close friend came to Christ at almost the same time I did as a high school student he gave his life to Christ and he ran for Christ with as Howard Cosell would say reckless abandonment if the word said to do it Greg did it he came to the realization in the scripture that if you're wrong somebody a believer in Christ makes it right he had worked at a pharmacy he had the privilege of closing the store many a night and as he would close the story he would help himself to many things that he wanted some perhaps he didn't even need year or two has gone by and he now realizes in those believer in Christ he needs to make it right he went back to an employer who had nearly forgotten him who really didn't know the details of the thefts and he asked his forgiveness and he took out his checkbook and wrote out a check to make it right employer said why would you come back I didn't expect this didn't even know it he said because I now believe in Christ and this is what he's told me to do one of the hardest things we do is to return when we need to make it right but you know character lasts for all time and that same young man now today read in the scriptures where God said that he was to go and so he's gone to the city of Philadelphia he's working in an obscure ministry it's not a big church not a well-known church what he does is he walks the inner city of Philadelphia three days a week telling the undesirables of society about Jesus Christ his name's now been written up in a popular journal and the people that were interviewed said well he just cares and week by week he returns to the same spot and he bridges you need to mend and he fences that you've crossed and he passed to which you need to make a return to make it right Onesimus would go back the Lord Jesus would send him the third name we come to as a guy I like his name is Aristarchus can I tell you why I like him? Aristarchus means roller of the dinner I mean if that's a job I'll take it I mean some of these other jobs sound pretty tough but roller of the dinner I like that one when you come to this man it says this my fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings as best historians have put it together Aristarchus is not a prisoner he's simply a man who loved Paul and he says Paul if that's where you're going to be I'm going to call him the man who joined he could have stayed at home he could have stayed in Rome but he didn't have to become a prisoner but he has a man who joined who identified who took the risk of becoming a partner at the end of this epistle Paul asked one final thing of his audience it sounds strange but he says remember my chains you see when you're on top everybody likes you your phone rings off the hook people care about you but when you're down when you're losing when you've lost who really remembers Paul said would you remember me? Aristarchus is one who remembered Paul he remembered his chains he said I'll not only remember I'll join him I'll become a partner with him I'll stand by his side remember my chains he reminds me of another obscure individual whom I love deeply as he has portrayed to me in the word his name is Onociferous I know many of you are thinking of naming your first born Onociferous it wouldn't be a bad name you see Onociferous was like Aristarchus Paul's in prison in Rome and he's alone and in 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 16 he says three things about Onociferous he sought me out he found me and he refreshed me you know there are people that need us to join in partnership with them to seek him out to find them and to refresh them really all it takes for us to do is to take interest in them instead of seeking for them to take interest in us many of us fail to have friends because we are always trying to get people interested in us instead of taking interest in them Dale Carnegie one of the world's leading authorities on friendship said you can make more friends in two months by becoming interested people than you can in two years by laboring to get people interested in you Aristarchus just said Paul I care about you I'm interested in you I'll join you I'll be your partner the fourth name we come to a little more familiar verse 10 mark the cousin of Barnabas sends his greetings you have received instruction about him if he comes to you welcome him we don't know a great deal about mark we only know some bottom lines that followed some traumatic events the events are missing allow me to give you a quick profile of this John mark he is the cousin of the famous Barnabas that great encourager who took Paul under his wing and nurtured him along in the faith and on Paul's first missionary journey Paul and Barnabas went out and with them went the young John mark and he travels with them for the first part of this missionary journey but something happens and John mark turns tail and returns home we don't know what and we don't know why but whatever it was was a significant irritation and issue to Paul a little time has gone by and it's time for Paul and Barnabas to go out again and to rekindle those churches that they planted and Paul says to Barnabas let's go and Barnabas says all get John mark and Paul says whoa not this time he's failed but as you come to this passage suddenly you discover that Paul is now speaking of him as a friend in a companion once again he is with Paul and he's sending greetings from Paul to Colossae but there's even more powerful statement at the end of 2 Timothy chapter 4 Paul says I'm here alone send Timothy send John mark to me for he is profitable for me for the ministry can I call John mark the one who rebounded yes he failed yes he tripped yes he came up short but he rebounded I'm so thankful that God's the God of a second chance and he gives us the opportunity to recover and to rebound there's no Proverbs that puts it this way he who cast a friend aside like an old shoe without a soul Paul was not such a one there needed to be a recovery there needed to be repentance and mark rebounded there are a number of joys in the ministry amongst the best is seeing the recovery and the rebounding of a believer we moved here 11 years ago it doesn't seem that long to us as a family to you it may seem like an eternity but the 11 years have flown by in those early years as youth pastor there was a young man that we became very close he was an enthusiast for Christ bold and daring in his witness and he was a risk taker and every time he took a risk for Christ it paid off something happened in the college years he turned he started he fell away he called last month and there was a need in his life one of which I could help and I could say at the island of the conversation I'm so glad to hear for you from you tell me are you walking with Christ he said it's the joy of my life a year ago I came back to Christ and I've had some great experiences but that's near the top a week ago we sat for three hours and talked about old times and new the good and the bad and there's not anything better than to see a rebounder clear the boards for one more time John Mark the rebounder next we're introduced to a man who is obscure it says this verse 11 Jesus who is called justice also sends you greetings it's unusual today to have the name Jesus amongst the English speaking world but the Hispanics often will name somebody Jesus this man's name was Jesus but he was also known as justice we know nothing about this man other than he is sending greetings he is obscured but he's important enough that Paul mentions him by name and he is included in this general description it says these are these meaning Tychias Aristarchus Mark and now justice these are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God and they approved a comfort to me he at least bears this description he is the one who sends greetings and he has two praise worthy qualities one he is a fellow worker many times we don't feel like we have friends because our friendships are casual they're superficial and they're only built on the good times I love buddies that I can go golfing with I love those friends that I jog with and that I play games of recreation with and they're indeed friends but your closest friends will be those with whom you have worked as partners that word fellow speaks of partnership the word work speaks of investment and when you become partners in investing your life with others there comes a bond to you that is second to none old army buddies are amongst the world's closest I said that there's no fellowship like the fellowship of a foxhole justice was such a one but he was not only a fellow worker it says that he's proved to be also a comforter I got a chuckle when I read what the word comforter comes into English it's our English word paragoric now some of you young ones won't remember that I remember paragoric do you remember having a terrible stomachache and your mother would come with this wretched bottle and a spoon I want to tell you that stuff works because any time I complained about a stomachache after I tasted it at once and my mother opened it up I said I feel better I don't know how they could take a good word like that and identify it with a poison like that medicine except for they both have this in common they bring relief and justice brought relief to a tired to a lonely to a worn torn apostle Paul he was relieved from pain he was one who brought greetings next we're introduced to a man by the name of a paphras verse 12 a paphras who is one of you another one from Colossae and a servant of Christ sends greetings he is always wrestling in prayer for you that you may stand firm in all of the will of God mature and fully assured we will call him the one who prayed sure they all prayed but listen to this guy he is wrestling in prayer I don't know if you've watched much wrestling but there are a number of sports that I like to watch and I don't like to participate in that is one if a wrestler grabs ahold of you you're in trouble I never wrestled formally but when I was at Taylor as a freshman in college we had an intramural program and I was the runt of the litter the only guy in the floor who weighed under 145 pounds and the big guys in the floor came and put their arm around me and they said you know Hawks if you would just wrestle we'd get one point towards the total team standings how about wrestling I said sure I went down into the basement of this old gym there was nobody there but a bunch of us guys who couldn't wrestle and I'm the wrestler in the first match and the guy I'm wrestling against is a fifth year senior he's wrestled for the school for the last four years they blew the whistle to go he jerked and grabbed me and he dislocated an old shoulder injury I never did a thing he crawled off the mat I won the next match was another guy like myself he was a draft he had never wrestled before and by the grace of God I won that the next match was another great wrestler he got the flu that day and I won by default you think this is all good I've now wrestled one other wimp like myself and I'm in the finals we moved out of the basement to the main floor of Taylor University's gymnasium half of the school is there to watch I'm now wrestling against a man who had wrestled for Taylor before he was good I mean when he walked up to me you know how wrestlers they turned their head and you know I didn't know what he was going to do I can tell you this in 27 seconds I was pinned and that was with him dragging me back on to the match three times I was just trying to get out of there and he wouldn't let go I'd run for that circle and he'd grab me and pull me back and he was tough he had a grip and he wouldn't quit wouldn't you love to have a guy like that praying for you a guy who won't let go of you who won't let you out of his sight and he's going to see this through till it's pinned down and finished the pafras wrestled for them in prayer you know this church is filled with some almost nameless warriors of prayer they don't stand up front as is my privilege they kneel in a quiet place and they are this church's power and they are my personal refuge there is a friend we've even talked about him working here and the staff his health would not allow it and he felt as though his days of ministry had ended perhaps the greatest minister in this church I came to that conclusion the day he put his arm around me and said I just wanted you to know that I pray for you every day and I pray for our board and our staff every day aren't you thankful for wrestlers for Christ who won't give up praying don't ever say I don't have a ministry because I can't don't focus on what you can't because there are those today in a hospital who can't move a leg who can't speak a word but the Heavenly Father here is the prayers of their praying the next individual after the one who prayed is the one who stayed
[time=3383] Luke from the time you come through Acts chapter 20 on Paul is always in the companionship of Luke the book of Acts reads like this for the first twenty chapters they went he did they said and you come to chapter 20 it changes it's no longer he and they and him and them it's we and us the author Luke joins Paul on the second missionary journey he's found here with him in prison he's found with him at the end of the second Timothy Luke is always there he is the one who stayed but unfortunately the one who prayed is followed by the one who stayed and he is followed by the one who strayed Demas also sends greetings at second Timothy chapter four verse ten this Demas of whom we know little is described thusly Demas has deserted me having loved this present world Caesar put these words are excuse me Shakespeare put these words in Caesar's mouth a friend should bear a friend's burden but Judas has added to all of mine to Paul's burden would be added the burden of one who strayed Demas but don't give up on him I don't know the end of the story is any different than what we've said today but perhaps in an unwritten chapter there is the story that he like Mark rebounded we can only hope if you're a Demas today and you have strayed there is still opportunity for you to change your mentor from Demas to Mark and to not only strayed but to rebound won't you come to Christ
