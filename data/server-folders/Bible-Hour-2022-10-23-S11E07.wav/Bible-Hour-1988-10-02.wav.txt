[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=113] He was about to fulfill the highest dream of any jurist, a seed on the bench of the Supreme Court.
[time=121] And then Judge Ginsburg's past came back.
[time=127] She should have been the happiest lady in America.
[time=131] Rachel Jackson's husband, Andrew, had just been elected president.
[time=136] But then her past came back.
[time=141] A gold medal was hung about Ben Johnson's neck, and a world record was smashed behind him.
[time=149] And then his past, the use of steroids came back.
[time=156] What do you do when your past comes back?
[time=161] (bells chiming)
[time=174] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=176] Thank you for joining us.
[time=178] Rick's message today is entitled "When Your Past Comes Back" and is taken from the book of Philemon.
[time=184] What do you do when your past comes back?
[time=187] Misunderstanding mistakes and simple, unexcusable sin are a part of each life.
[time=193] Often these are forgotten memories until they resurface, often with a destructive vengeance.
[time=199] Today we will be studying the short New Testament letter Philemon, which introduces us to a man with a past, his name, Onesimus.
[time=208] In our study, we will face what to do when your past comes back.
[time=213] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=216] Rick's text today is the book of Philemon.
[time=220] The sanctuary choir will be administering to us in song.
[time=225] Other special music includes a song from the Men Singers Quartet and a solo from Susan Toyrap.
[time=233] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=241] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=246] Now here's Rick.
[time=247] Jesus Christ, who is the light of the world.
[time=250] It's the prayer of our heart that He would shine on us and in us and through us.
[time=255] That His love would be made known through this community.
[time=259] Oh, how He loves us and we love Him and He teaches us to love one another.
[time=265] We're delighted that you've come today that we can worship the Lord together.
[time=269] We welcome you here to Black Hawk and to the Bible Hour.
[time=273] We trust that God will use this hour to bring praise and honor to His name and to build up believers in their faith and to draw those who are searching into a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=285] Thank you for coming today.
[time=287] We trust that God will encourage your heart as we worship together.
[time=309] The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, is mighty.
[time=314] He will save me, will rejoice, and will lead with joy.
[time=318] He will rest in his heart, he will join, and he will sing.
[time=323] The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, is mighty, is mighty.
[time=334] He will save me, will rejoice, and will lead with joy.
[time=338] He will rest in his heart, he will join, and he will sing.
[time=343] The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, is mighty, is mighty, is mighty.
[time=353] The Lord of Christ, let enemies be scattered.
[time=358] Let God arise, let enemies be scattered.
[time=367] Let God, let God arise.
[time=376] Let God arise, let enemies be scattered.
[time=383] Let enemies be scattered, let God, let God arise.
[time=389] In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, we have a victory.
[time=398] In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, same time to have to flee.
[time=407] Who can tell what God can do?
[time=412] Who can tell what is love for you?
[time=416] In the name of Jesus, Jesus, we have a victory.
[time=425] Who can tell what God can do?
[time=430] Who can tell what is love for you?
[time=434] In the name of Jesus, Jesus, we have a victory.
[time=443] The name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, we have a victory.
[time=463] The glory has grown.
[time=468] In any way, how is we lost?
[time=475] Has it be deeper?
[time=479] Give me more.
[time=484] In the name of Jesus, same above all else.
[time=532] [MUSIC]
[time=548] What a privilege to sing and to honor the name of the Lord.
[time=551] A Lord that is living alive today in our hearts.
[time=555] We praise Him for that.
[time=557] And to go on with this theme, we need to stand and sing.
[time=561] Up, stand up for Jesus.
[time=563] I want you to stand as we sing the first, second and fourth stanzas of 618.
[time=569] Him number 618.
[time=576] [MUSIC]
[time=583] Up, stand up for Jesus.
[time=590] [MUSIC]
[time=594] In the name of Jesus, same above all else.
[time=599] Up, stand up for Jesus.
[time=627] If I is for your banner, it must not.
[time=634] It must not suffer once.
[time=642] [MUSIC]
[time=656] In the name of Jesus.
[time=663] Up, stand up for Jesus.
[time=677] [MUSIC]
[time=701] Stand up, stand up for Jesus.
[time=706] The strike will not be long.
[time=710] This day, the noise of battle.
[time=714] The next, the victor song.
[time=718] To Him that overcometh.
[time=722] My crown of mine shall be.
[time=726] He with the King of glory.
[time=730] Shall reign enter away.
[time=739] Stand up for Jesus.
[time=743] These soldiers of the cross.
[time=747] If I is for your banner, it must not.
[time=754] It must not suffer once.
[time=765] Thank you very much.
[time=766] You may be seated.
[time=768] Thank you for that acclimation of your faith in Jesus Christ, the captain of our army.
[time=775] We've had a delightful time this fall getting ready for our entrance into our new building next week.
[time=781] The choir has been so responsive.
[time=784] Our special musicians have done so well, and we really do appreciate the music that we have at our church and the musicians that work so hard.
[time=792] The quartet is a unique group to be with, to practice with.
[time=796] We have fun together, we have a great time, and we love the Lord and love to sing about Him.
[time=802] The question is, who can move the mountains that are hindering you today?
[time=806] It is Jesus, He's the One.
[time=814] Who can move the mountains that are hindering you today?
[time=828] Who can pick them up like pebbles squared and from the way?
[time=835] Who can prove His power when a Christian needs to pray?
[time=841] It is Jesus, He's the One.
[time=849] Jesus holds of power in His mighty hands to guide.
[time=856] He's the One who heals the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=863] He makes all things possible and He's a friend of mine.
[time=869] Blessed Jesus, He's the One.
[time=876] Who can heal the heartache that is crushing you within?
[time=883] Who can pour the ball of heaven where the hood has made?
[time=890] Who can chase the shadows, make the song of joy beginning?
[time=896] It is Jesus, He's the One.
[time=903] Jesus holds of power in His mighty hands to guide.
[time=910] He's the One who heals the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=917] He makes all things possible and He's a friend of mine.
[time=923] Blessed Jesus, He's the One, the Only One.
[time=931] Who can give you from all harm and guide you by the hand?
[time=937] Who can give you power for service and the strength to stand?
[time=944] Who can give you grace for all that living may demand?
[time=950] It is Jesus, He's the One, the One.
[time=958] Jesus holds of power in His mighty hands to guide.
[time=965] He's the One who heals the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=972] He makes all things possible and He's a friend of mine.
[time=978] Blessed Jesus, He's the One.
[time=1003] (Applause)
[time=1010] Thank you again for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1014] Pete, I understand you got a most encouraging letter this past week.
[time=1018] Well, on Tuesday morning, Rick, when I came into work, I opened my mail and one of the letters was from a Bible Hour viewer who had watched last week.
[time=1026] And when we prayed the prayer of commitment, asking Jesus Christ to come into your heart, He said, "I prayed along with you and accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior." And that's really what the Bible Hour is all about.
[time=1036] We patiently and yet consistently tell people that Jesus died for their sins and they can't have eternal life through Jesus Christ.
[time=1043] So that was really an encouragement to our ministry here.
[time=1046] Oh, that's fantastic.
[time=1048] For many of you who watch regularly and pray for people to come to Christ, perhaps you are part of the financial backbone of the Bible Hour, the Founders Club.
[time=1058] What a great dividend, great reward on our investment to know that there are people who are coming to Christ.
[time=1064] Now, I encourage those of you who are watching, if you've made a decision to accept Christ as your Savior,
[time=1070] would you do us the kindness and courtesy of writing and letting us know that?
[time=1074] That is so encouraging.
[time=1075] That is really encouraging, Rick, you're right.
[time=1078] Well, this is hopefully Lord willing plan to be our last Sunday here in this auditorium.
[time=1084] We're making the move next week.
[time=1086] Now, any number of things could happen, but we are committed and look for a new setting for the Bible Hour next week.
[time=1093] Don't think you have the wrong television ministry.
[time=1095] We're moving to our new sanctuary across the street.
[time=1098] And we want to invite you to be a part of our dedication celebration, which is coming up on October 14th, 15th, and 16th.
[time=1106] Well, Rick, a few weeks ago it seemed so long ways away, but now it's right around the corner.
[time=1111] And we're really excited to announce to you that Nielsen and Young, dual pianists will be here.
[time=1116] They'll be playing on some brand new pianos that were donated to our church through a generous donor.
[time=1122] We're just so grateful for that.
[time=1123] They are marvelous musicians. You will really enjoy Friday evening, October 14th, the beginning of our dedication weekend.
[time=1131] Well, that will be a highlight.
[time=1133] And then on the next evening, Saturday, the 15th, Pastor David Jeremiah will be back here with us at Blackhawk here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1143] Pastor Jeremiah was the church's first pastor and the founder of the Bible Hour.
[time=1148] He has been gone ministering in San Diego for seven years now, and will be a great welcome back evening.
[time=1154] I'll bet many of you remember his ministry when he was the host of the Bible Hour, and we want to invite you all back for that evening of Saturday, October 15th.
[time=1164] And then Sunday, October 16th at 3 o'clock is the final closing ceremony of the dedication, however you'd like to call it.
[time=1172] And we're having David Burnham here.
[time=1174] David is the man who led me to Christ, who nurtured me and led me step by step in the early years of my Christian life.
[time=1182] He is right now in Seoul, Korea ministering to athletes is the head of an international sports coalition, and he'll be freshly back from the Olympics and fresh in God's word to challenge this church as we dedicate our new facility.
[time=1197] So that'll be a great weekend.
[time=1199] I'm looking forward to hearing David Burnham, it's a number of years since I've heard him, and as well, Pastor Jeremiah is always a challenging speaker.
[time=1206] So that'll be wonderful.
[time=1208] Well, all of this is to help us develop a keener, closer walk with God, and that can happen just through this hour we spend together.
[time=1217] It's got to be a personal commitment on your part to have a close walk with God.
[time=1222] And to help you and assist you in that challenge we offer this booklet with the same title, Closer Walk.
[time=1228] It is a daily Bible study guide to help you systematically with organization get into God's word daily.
[time=1236] Many of us open up the Bible and we randomly read this or that and usually gravitate back to those familiar spots and never dig into anything new or deeper.
[time=1246] Well, this guide will take you through God's word the New Testament in one year's time, and we'd love to send you a copy to introduce you to personal Bible study.
[time=1256] It is free and we pay the postage, you simply need to write and ask for it.
[time=1261] Just write and request your free booklet a closer walk right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1273] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1281] Thank you, Pete, and thank you again for joining us here today, and I do want to encourage you again to write.
[time=1288] We'd love to know of the spiritual decisions you have made. It would be a great encouragement to each one of us. Thank you.
[time=1303] [MUSIC]
[time=1309] Lord, I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Maker of all.
[time=1323] And I believe in Lord Jesus, only be God and Son of God.
[time=1336] I believe in your Holy Spirit, the giver of all life, the seeding from the Father and the Son of Lord, Father.
[time=1363] I believe Jesus came in the flesh, I believe, conceived by God, virgin born.
[time=1382] He conquered, rose again, now his kingdom has no end.
[time=1394] Lord, I believe in one body, born of your Spirit, baptized in you.
[time=1408] I'm looking for the resurrection. I've been forgiven to reign with you.
[time=1422] I believe you will come again, Lord, to judge the poor and the dead.
[time=1435] And I believe I will live forever more, just like you said.
[time=1465] Lord, I believe in one body, born of your Spirit, baptized in you.
[time=1481] I'm looking for the resurrection. I've been forgiven to reign with you.
[time=1495] I believe you will come again, Lord, to judge the poor and the dead.
[time=1508] And I believe I will live forever more, just like you said.
[time=1551] Thank you, Susan. If you have your Bible, I invite you to open your Bible that we can memorize God's Word together.
[time=1559] Before Dale comes and leads us, I wanted to challenge you to be memorizing God's Word.
[time=1565] We've not always made that the habit that we should have.
[time=1568] And as I look out, I see many of you heads up memorizing, and others of you are new to Blackhawk, and you're just reading it, and that's fine.
[time=1576] But the Bible places such an emphasis on hiding God's Word in our hearts that today I wanted to challenge you and encourage you.
[time=1584] We're going to slow down the pace and give you one verse a month to memorize instead of one per week.
[time=1590] But would you memorize God's Word together?
[time=1593] Would you stand, Dale, lead us in reciting God's Word?
[time=1601] Our verse this week is Colossians 4-6.
[time=1605] Colossians 4-6. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with Saul, so that you may know how to answer everyone.
[time=1618] Colossians 4-6. Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1623] Thanks, Dale. Thank you, Dale. It's now our privilege to look to the Father in prayer, and I invite you to bow with me.
[time=1634] Sweet Hour of Prayer, Sweet Hour of Prayer, that calls me from a world of care, and bids me at my Father's throne, make all of my wants, and wishes known.
[time=1652] Our Father this morning, we turn our eyes on you, and we come to this moment of prayer with a list of wishes and wants.
[time=1663] But first in our heart today is a desire to declare that we love you, that we meet in this place to worship you, and we want your name to be exalted and magnified in our lips and from our lives.
[time=1678] And so today, Lord Jesus, we ask you to meet with us in spirit and truth as we praise your name.
[time=1686] We ask you through your Word to give us insight so that we might know you and know how you would want us to live.
[time=1695] We pray today that you would refresh us in your Word.
[time=1700] Give us that shot in the arm, that boost from the rear that accelerates our living, that we might please you.
[time=1710] We pray today that you would ease burdens, lighten loads, relieve tensions.
[time=1719] As we come to you today, we take you at your invitation, and we cast our care upon you, and so today we unburden our heart.
[time=1730] We give you our sons who have been disobedient, our daughters who have been wayward, our parents who have misguided their lives and sometimes ours.
[time=1742] We give to you the burden of our health, the stubbornness of old habits and desire to be made new.
[time=1752] We come to you with thanksgiving for Godly mothers and fathers who have set a pace and a pattern.
[time=1759] We thank you for Sunday school teachers who have nurtured us.
[time=1764] We thank you for Godly friends who have encouraged us with a song or a word.
[time=1770] Today we ask of you comfort for those who have lost loved ones, who have been rejected, who have been mistreated or misunderstood.
[time=1783] Father, we come to you in need of forgiveness.
[time=1787] We are all fugitives from birth runaways, and we come home to you now, to face our past, to find your forgiveness.
[time=1799] And in this life as we struggle, we ask for your wisdom that we might know how to deal with success and prosperity, a well's defeat and discouragement.
[time=1812] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1819] What do you do when your past comes back?
[time=1825] His dream of a lifetime was about to be fulfilled.
[time=1829] It would be the dream of any jurist, a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court.
[time=1835] And just as he was nominated for that position, Judge Ginsburg's past came back.
[time=1845] She should have been the happiest lady in America while Rachel Jackson husband, Andrew had just been elected President of the United States, but that day her past had come back.
[time=1858] It had been reported incorrectly that she and Andrew were married several weeks before her divorce was final.
[time=1869] Well, that was a mistake. They had been given misinformation, but no one would believe.
[time=1876] And her past came back.
[time=1880] They hung a gold medal about his neck.
[time=1884] His country's flag was hoisted above all others, and it was Canada's national anthem that we all listened to as Ben Johnson smashed a world's record until his past came back.
[time=1898] And he was tested positive for the use of steroids.
[time=1904] He had been a criminal, and he was guilty.
[time=1910] But he had slipped out of that town and gone to another.
[time=1914] His identity changed, his past behind him, and Jean-Vell Jean in Les Miserables by Victor Hugo ascends to the eminence of mayor of his community until one comes.
[time=1927] And confronts him, and his past came back.
[time=1933] What do you do when your past comes back?
[time=1939] There's a short epistle in the Bible that deals with this theme.
[time=1942] It bears the title of its recipient, Philemon.
[time=1946] If you have a Bible, open it please to Philemon.
[time=1949] If you've studied with us for the past four months, your Bible probably has a permanent crease at Colossians.
[time=1956] Find the crease and go first in 2 Thessalonians, first in 2 Timothy, Titus Philemon.
[time=1963] One chapter before the lengthy book of Hebrews.
[time=1966] If that road map didn't get you there, there's a better one in the front of your Bible called a table of contents.
[time=1973] Don't ever be embarrassed to turn there and to try to find it.
[time=1976] That'll help you find our point of study.
[time=1979] This morning, as we study Philemon, it is a great book of practical insight.
[time=1986] It will give us before we're done four very practical lessons to be learned.
[time=1990] One of those is, what do you do when your past comes back?
[time=1995] First, allow me to introduce this book to you.
[time=1997] If you were a Bible student today suffering many things at the hands of the chief priests and elders in Bible school,
[time=2005] you would go through a course called New Testament Introduction.
[time=2008] They don't introduce you to the New Testament.
[time=2010] They give you all this history and archaeology and lower criticism and higher criticism,
[time=2016] and I'm just critical and I don't know what that means.
[time=2019] But I want to give you a brief introduction to this today that I hope that will help you understand.
[time=2024] First of all, let's introduce the cast in this living drama.
[time=2029] The author is Paul.
[time=2031] He probably needs less introduction than any person out of the pages of the Bible other than the Lord himself.
[time=2037] He writes describing himself as a prisoner, and he is now in prison in Rome writing to this man by the name of Philemon.
[time=2049] He begins Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
[time=2053] Now, if you know a little bit of Paul's life, you know he was in prison often.
[time=2057] How do we know that it was in Rome?
[time=2059] Well, we know that it's in Rome because of the content of this letter.
[time=2065] We come to an individual who's named in verse 10 by the name of Onesimus.
[time=2070] And just last week in Colossians chapter 4 verse 17, we saw that Paul was writing a letter from a Roman prison to Colossae,
[time=2080] and he was saying, "I'm sending Onesimus to you."
[time=2086] So Philemon's letter and Colossians' letter were written at the same time from the same place because Onesimus is there and he's being sent.
[time=2094] Also, Aristarchus is there, the ruler of the dinner, and Demus is there who later defacts.
[time=2103] So you start studying it, you start seeing the common thread there, and it's Paul writing from a Roman prison, one of which he hopes to be released.
[time=2114] He is writing to three people by name, Philemon, who is the principal character, and Philemon is described often in this epistle in some glowing terms.
[time=2125] First of all, Philemon is a Christian. He's a believer in Christ, and he came to Christ through Paul's witness, perhaps on one of Paul's missionary journeys.
[time=2135] We find that in verse 19, where Paul says to Philemon, these words, "I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand." He had a secretary too.
[time=2147] "I will pay it back, not to mention that you owe me your very own self."
[time=2154] That was Paul's way of saying, "Philemon, you have a debt of your very soul to me."
[time=2160] Paul had led him to Christ. Philemon's a believer, and he's a believer known for his faith, his love, and his hospitality.
[time=2169] Look at verse 4, "I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers because I hear about your faith."
[time=2177] Note that in the Lord Jesus Christ, "And your love," note that too, please, "for all the saints.
[time=2186] I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.
[time=2194] Your love has given me great joy and encouragement because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints."
[time=2203] Faith, love, and hospitality. That hospitality extended to the point where his heart and his home were open.
[time=2211] In verse 2, it tells us that the church actually met in his house.
[time=2216] That leads us to another conclusion. He was probably a fairly wealthy individual.
[time=2221] His home was big enough, and he was affluent enough, that he could open up the church or his home for the church.
[time=2229] He was also wealthy enough that he himself had, within his structure of a home, those who worked for him and those who were his slaves,
[time=2239] chiefly Onesimus, a runaway slave at that.
[time=2243] Philemon is therein introduced, and there comes a second name, "Aphia."
[time=2249] Aphia, as best we can surmise is probably his wife. Philemon is masculine, Aphia is feminine, and so the two are identified there, and it is sent out to the two of them.
[time=2263] And then we come to a name, Archipas. We came to that name last week. At the end of Colossians, it says, "Tell Archipas, quote, see to it that you complete the work that you have in the Lord."
[time=2277] It could be that Archipas is his son. In verse 10, we meet another player in this living cast, Onesimus.
[time=2288] He too was introduced last week at the end of Colossians. He is a runaway slave, a fugitive from Roman law.
[time=2297] He was a servant in the house of this man by the name of Philemon in the land that we now call Turkey.
[time=2304] As Turkey touches the Aegean Sea, there is a channel that flows up and leads you to the cities of Colossi, Ariopolis, and Laodicea.
[time=2314] That is hometown. That's familiar turf to Philemon and Anonesimus.
[time=2320] From there, he has fled westward over a thousand miles, and he has gotten lost in the millions of inhabitants of Rome.
[time=2331] Though a fugitive he now breathes free air. And there in Rome, he starts a whole new life.
[time=2339] And he comes into contact with none other than the Apostle Paul, where we're not certain.
[time=2346] Paul Minor, scholar and archaeologist suggest that they met in prison could be.
[time=2352] But somewhere, the two of them, Onesimus and Paul, come into contact.
[time=2357] And it's through Paul's influence that Onesimus gives his heart to Christ.
[time=2364] Verse 10, "I appealed to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.
[time=2373] While Paul was manicaled in a Roman prison house, he led Onesimus to Christ."
[time=2382] Onesimus has got a new life. He's in a new town. He's got a new lord.
[time=2386] He has got a new faith. He is a new man. And suddenly, it's all interrupted when his past came back.
[time=2396] It was discovered that he was not a free man. Rome was not his home. He was from over there.
[time=2407] In Asia Minor. And he was a slave.
[time=2411] It could very well be that the light of this situation came about when a man by the name of Apaphras,
[time=2418] that one who wrestled for them in prayer, traveled, bringing greetings from the church of Colossi to Paul in prison.
[time=2425] And here comes Apaphras, and suddenly, there comes a familiar face-to-face contact.
[time=2431] Onesimus with Apaphras, Onesimus with his past.
[time=2439] And now, he is instructed to go back.
[time=2445] All of that introduction is believed to be very factual.
[time=2450] Now, on top of those facts, let me give you some further possibilities.
[time=2455] Now, this is digging deep into New Testament introduction.
[time=2459] If you follow this and believe it, it won't make a difference when you get to heaven if you don't.
[time=2467] But there's a possibility that Philemon is the man in whose house the church meets.
[time=2474] And Archipas is not his son, but is actually the pastor of the church in Philemon's house.
[time=2482] Why would we think that?
[time=2484] Well, at the end of Colossians, it is Archipas who is identified in spiritual leadership as fellow soldier, fellow worker,
[time=2492] and he is told to lead and complete the task.
[time=2496] It's the type of charge that Paul would give to a Timothy and a Titus, a pastor.
[time=2502] There's a second possibility to breathe into this.
[time=2506] It could be that Philemon does not live in Colossi, but he actually lives in neighboring Laodicea.
[time=2513] They're all clustered together.
[time=2516] When we lived outside of the city limits and we went back home to Akron, Ohio, and people said, "Where do you live?" I didn't say in St. Joe Township.
[time=2525] They'd never heard of it.
[time=2527] I said, "I live in Fort Wayne." I wasn't lying. I was just giving you the neighborhood.
[time=2532] These little cities of Colossi, Laodicea, and Ariopolis are close.
[time=2538] It could be this, that Philemon has the house church in Laodicea, Nympha has the house church in Colossi.
[time=2548] And Archipas is the pastor of this church in Laodicea.
[time=2553] Now when you read Colossians chapter 4, Paul says, "Now you people in Colossians, you read this letter,
[time=2560] and then you give it to the church of Laodicea, and get the letter I sent to the Laodiceans and make sure you read it."
[time=2567] And the whole point is this, we don't have a book of Laodicea in the Bible.
[time=2574] Now it could be that it's a totally uninspired letter that Paul wrote to some friends in Laodicea, and he gave him a recipe on barbecuing chicken Roman style.
[time=2583] I don't know. It's gone.
[time=2586] But it could also be as a possibility that the epistle to the Laodiceans is another than the epistle, the Philemon.
[time=2596] Now, let me tell you why that can become important.
[time=2601] Well, let me pretend that I'm Philemon, and we are in a slave society, and one of my slaves is Steve.
[time=2610] And Steve has run away, and Paul is now writing to me, and he sends me a private letter, and I put this private letter in my pocket, and when no one's around, I open it up, and it says, "Dear Hawks, let Steve go, free him, and send them back to me to help me out.
[time=2627] But I'll leave it up to you," I've told no one else.
[time=2631] Now, I'd probably do what most Christians would do.
[time=2633] I'd put it in my pocket and say, "I'll pray about it," which means I'm not going to do a thing.
[time=2640] And there the whole matter is kind of mine to deal with.
[time=2644] But suppose the letter doesn't come to me, it comes to the whole church.
[time=2649] And before I ever see the letter, the secretary treasure of the board of our church brings the letter,
[time=2656] stands before the church and says, "We have this letter from the apostle Paul." It says, "Dear Hawks, please set Steve free and send him to me.
[time=2665] You think I'm going to stand up in front of 2,000 people and say, "I'll pray about that." I'll say, "Steve, that's just what I was going to do anyway, on your way." It could very well be that Paul here in the political terms has whipped up the crowd in his favor.
[time=2681] And this letter, Philemon, went to the whole church of Laodicea so that they would put pressure on him to set him free.
[time=2689] Well, welcome to the wonderful world of New Testament investigation and introduction.
[time=2695] Now, let's look at Paul's appeal.
[time=2697] I find that he appeals for three things here.
[time=2700] First of all, the general appeal of this letter in behalf of Onesimus is an appeal for mercy.
[time=2707] Roman law was harsh, it was brutal.
[time=2711] Philemon needed no permission to deal with Onesimus any way he wanted.
[time=2717] He could beat him and frog him, and he could kill him and crucify him if that was his desire, and there wasn't one hand that would stop him.
[time=2725] Onesimus was a slave.
[time=2729] Most likely, a man would not kill his slave because that worked out to his own economic disadvantage.
[time=2735] Typically, they would do two things, beat them severely, and then brand them with the letter F, Fugitivas, Latin for the fugitive, the runaway.
[time=2749] Paul's appeal is first an appeal for mercy.
[time=2754] Secondly, it's appeal for a brand new relationship.
[time=2759] Society was very structured, it was very rigid.
[time=2763] There were Romans, and there were non-Romans.
[time=2766] There were Patricians, and there were plebeians.
[time=2769] There were slave owners, and there were slaves, and in our idiom, and never the two did meet.
[time=2778] Now, look at these verses of Paul's appeal for acceptance.
[time=2782] Verse 15, perhaps the reason he Onesimus was separated from you for a little while was so that you might have him back for good.
[time=2791] No longer as a slave, but better than a slave as a dear brother.
[time=2797] He is very dear to me, but even dear to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
[time=2805] So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
[time=2810] Let's compare two welcomes.
[time=2813] Welcome number one is the arrival of a fugitive slave.
[time=2819] What welcome would he be given?
[time=2822] He would be imprisoned, he would be shackled, he would be beaten, and he would be branded.
[time=2828] And that would be being let off easy in that day.
[time=2833] But Paul says, don't welcome him as Onesimus the slave, but welcome him back first as a man.
[time=2840] Not as a slave, but as a man.
[time=2842] That's an important point because under Roman law, a slave was not a man.
[time=2849] A slave was property, and the owner of property could dispose of property any way he wanted to.
[time=2856] I own the car, I can do what I want with that car, I can wreck it, I can beat it, I can bash it as long as I don't do it against your car.
[time=2864] It's mine, I can dispose of it any way I want to.
[time=2868] And Onesimus could be similarly treated, but not if he's a man.
[time=2874] Paul called him a man, and you receive him as a man.
[time=2878] Some of you are an authority over other people, maybe it's your own son, maybe it's somebody who works for you, and you lord over them that you're in charge, don't ever think that you're in charge, and that gives you the right to treat somebody else's less than a man.
[time=2891] On paper, and at work, you may be the superior.
[time=2894] The day the whistle blows, you're equal.
[time=2900] Not only you treat him as a man, but then you treat him as a brother.
[time=2904] You don't say to this individual, you're my slave, I own you, that's your brother.
[time=2909] You receive him back and embrace him as a long lost and deared one.
[time=2914] And then finally Paul says, you welcome him, like you'd welcome me.
[time=2918] How do you think they'd welcome Paul?
[time=2921] I think when they saw Paul coming through, they would stand to their feet in loving adoration.
[time=2927] He was the man that established their church.
[time=2930] He was the one that led them to Christ.
[time=2933] He was the one that sat in their jail and suffered for them.
[time=2937] He was the one that got inspired to write thirteen epistles of his word to strengthen them.
[time=2943] And Paul said, the way you'd receive me, you receive him.
[time=2949] Thirdly, Paul appealed for the release of Onesimus and a return to Rome to help him.
[time=2961] Verses 13 and 20, give us that, verse 13, Paul said, I would like to keep him with me
[time=2968] so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
[time=2973] I'd like to have with that Onesimus helping me, verse 20.
[time=2980] I do wish, Brother Philemon, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord.
[time=2987] Refresh my heart in Christ, confident of your obedience, I write to you knowing that you
[time=2993] will do even more than I ask.
[time=2996] So Paul's appeal is for mercy.
[time=2999] His appeal is to recognize a new relationship, and his appeal is to release him from slavery
[time=3006] so that he can come back and help Paul.
[time=3009] Now how Paul won about this appeal, his approach is one of subjective debate.
[time=3015] I've read a number of commentators this week who said, oh Paul was so kind, he was so gracious.
[time=3020] Why he doesn't even call himself Paul the Apostle, he's low key here.
[time=3025] I disagree with that.
[time=3026] I find Paul here pointing a six barreled gun at Philemon, and they're all loaded.
[time=3032] There's a bullet in each chamber.
[time=3034] Let me give you the six slugs of his appeal.
[time=3038] First one is found in verse 8, quote, "It's the appeal of love," sort of.
[time=3045] Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold in order to you to do what you ought to do,
[time=3051] yet I appeal to you on the basis of love.
[time=3053] I mean that's appealing out of love after you tell him who stands where.
[time=3059] Now I can tell you to do this, but it would really be nice if you chose to.
[time=3064] So why don't you choose to just before I tell you to?
[time=3067] That's bullet number one.
[time=3069] Bullet number two is he not only gives him a shot about love, but he gives him a shot out of sympathy.
[time=3076] Verse nine.
[time=3078] Yet I appeal to you on the basis of love.
[time=3081] I then, Paul, you know I get this, an old man, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
[time=3091] I mean get out the Kleenex, folks.
[time=3095] I mean how's Philemon going to reject that?
[time=3098] Here's Paul telling them about his old, and you know you read into their arthritis and rheumatism and lumbago, you know, and now he's in chains.
[time=3107] I'm going to pour in a little sympathy.
[time=3110] Third bullet.
[time=3112] Affection.
[time=3114] Verse 10.
[time=3115] I appeal to you not for Onesimus.
[time=3118] I appeal to you for my son, Onesimus.
[time=3122] My son who became my son's while I was in chains.
[time=3127] Formerly he was useless to you, but now he's become useful to both you and me.
[time=3132] I'm sending him back to you.
[time=3134] Who is my heart?
[time=3137] I mean he's really using all the heartstrings now.
[time=3141] I mean he's got a concert playing.
[time=3143] First sympathy now, affection.
[time=3144] I really love this guy.
[time=3146] He's like a son to me.
[time=3147] I mean you know he was useless to you.
[time=3149] Isn't that digging there?
[time=3151] I mean yeah he's just another slave.
[time=3153] He was useless.
[time=3154] Always profitable to me.
[time=3155] And I love him.
[time=3156] He was my son.
[time=3157] Bullet number four out of need.
[time=3161] Ironically, Onesimus name means profitable or useful.
[time=3166] But in verse 13 he said, you know I would like to keep him with me so that he could take
[time=3172] your place in helping me while I'm in chains.
[time=3175] I really need the guy.
[time=3176] I mean things are bad here.
[time=3178] Read the other epistles.
[time=3180] They're dropping like flies.
[time=3182] But Onesimus, well I need him.
[time=3185] Bullet number five, compensation.
[time=3188] Verses 18 and 19.
[time=3191] Paul said, if he has done any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
[time=3199] Go ahead, charge it to me.
[time=3200] I call him writing this with my own hand.
[time=3202] I will pay it back.
[time=3205] It's reminiscent of the Good Samaritan who took the man, nursed his wounds, put him in and in and said, whatever it takes to care for him, charge it to me.
[time=3213] Paul said, hey, did you lose money because your slave was gone?
[time=3217] Charge it to me.
[time=3218] If he cost you X number to nary and I'm telling you to release him, then charge me.
[time=3224] I'll pay for it.
[time=3225] I'll buy his freedom.
[time=3227] Did he steal something?
[time=3229] When he left did he have scound with the goods after a larceny?
[time=3233] I'll repay.
[time=3234] Go ahead, charge it to me.
[time=3237] And then finally, not too subtly, he appeals with an approach out of debt.
[time=3245] Verses 19.
[time=3246] I'll pay it back, not to mention that you owe me your very self.
[time=3253] In today's language we call it, calling one in.
[time=3257] Now Philemon, don't worry about the fact that I led you to Christ and I'm in prison for my work amongst you.
[time=3263] I mean, don't even think about all the things that you owe me while I just ask for Onesimus's freedom.
[time=3269] I mean, just don't think about it.
[time=3272] Verses 13, he says, I wish that I could keep Onesimus to help me here because I really
[time=3278] need to help Verses 13 says so that he could take your place, Philemon, and helping me.
[time=3283] I mean, Philemon, you haven't actually jumped out of a rhyme to come over and help me like Onesimus did.
[time=3291] I'm not citing against Paul, I'm just telling you, I don't find this very calm and subtle
[time=3298] and just whatever you want to do, Philemon.
[time=3300] I think he pointed a .357 magnum and said, go ahead, make my day.
[time=3307] He gave him six bullets of reasons why he better do it.
[time=3311] And I personally believe he sent the letter publicly so there would be a little peer pressure.
[time=3317] So with all this introduction, with all of this history, what does it mean to you and
[time=3324] to me today?
[time=3325] Four applications, if I could.
[time=3330] Application number one is this one.
[time=3333] When your past comes back, you must face it.
[time=3338] Onesimus passed, came back.
[time=3343] It came to him eyeball to eyeball and nose to nose in the person of Apaphras.
[time=3349] And now what will we do?
[time=3351] Will we stay in Rome?
[time=3352] Maybe he'll flee from Rome to Spain.
[time=3357] Hide again.
[time=3359] Paul sends him back to go face to face with Philemon.
[time=3366] Too often we make the mistake, why came to Christ?
[time=3368] He's forgiven all my sins and that's all I need to do.
[time=3371] That's all you need to do with the Heavenly Father, but that's not all we need to do with one another.
[time=3376] If we have hurt, if we have wronged, if we've offended another believer, it's not enough that God forgive us.
[time=3383] We must seek out each other and be forgiven.
[time=3386] And we must do whatever we can do to right the wrong.
[time=3392] When you have a past that you haven't faced, you face it.
[time=3398] It's honesty with integrity, forthrightness.
[time=3404] You ask that forgiveness and you do whatever you can do to make it right.
[time=3409] There's a second application here that I would make.
[time=3412] It is this one.
[time=3413] I quote Chuck Swindall.
[time=3416] "Every Christian was once a fugitive, enslaved to sin, from birth, a runaway."
[time=3426] We all have a past, not just of Nessimus, we all have a closet.
[time=3431] We keep its door shut.
[time=3434] Peter denied Christ three times.
[time=3439] Thomas doubted him even after the resurrection.
[time=3442] John Mark deserted ranks and went home.
[time=3447] Paul himself held out his arms so that men could take off their coats and throw him on the pile
[time=3455] so they could have a better back-reach when they threw the stones to put Stephen in death.
[time=3462] Paul had a past.
[time=3464] He was a co-conspirator in murder.
[time=3469] We all have a past.
[time=3471] We all need God's forgiveness and his redemption.
[time=3476] That word "redemption" is, let me use a Greek word.
[time=3479] It is the word "ex agarazzo." The agora was the marketplace where you could go down, you could buy a wheel, you could buy meat, you could buy a slave.
[time=3489] And there in the slave market a man would be held up.
[time=3492] His teeth would be checked and his arms and his back and his intellect.
[time=3496] And then he would be bought and sold like property.
[time=3499] And redemption is that Christ buys us out of the marketplace of sin.
[time=3524] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our sanctuary choir, soloist Susan Toyrak and the men's quartet.
[time=3530] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3533] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3541] Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=3543] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that you sent your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3551] And I know today that I've sinned against you.
[time=3554] And I ask you to come into my heart and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse me today.
[time=3560] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3564] As we mentioned earlier, we were so encouraged when one wrote in and talked about the fact that he prayed that prayer with me
[time=3570] and accepted Jesus Christ as his personal Savior.
[time=3573] I hope you'll write and tell us of your decision.
[time=3575] And when you write, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3583] To receive a copy of "Your Decision" or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Closer Walk", please write to the Bible hour,
[time=3591] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3596] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request take number 1363 or use the sermon title when your past comes back.
[time=3604] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help to fray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3611] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3621] Perhaps you've thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3625] Why not do it today?
[time=3626] I know it would be an encouragement to pastor Rick and the entire Bible hour staff.
