[time=98] In the 1800s, the Pony Express could carry the mail from St. Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California in just 10 short days and all by Pony Express.
[time=111] It took 10 men and 40 horses. Both the men and the animals were trained precisely.
[time=117] A specially designed saddle was created just for the Pony Express.
[time=122] They carried a minimal amount of supplies and goods, but required with every rider was a full Old and New Testament copy of the Bible.
[time=132] The Bible, the essential element of life.

[time=149] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=152] We're glad you could join us for our very first service in our new sanctuary.
[time=157] Life is surrounded with issues of serious and grave consequences, suicide, drugs, depression, gambling, alcohol, death.
[time=167] Where can we turn for answers? Who can guide us through the maze of choices and decisions?
[time=173] What is our reference point? The word of God is the answer.
[time=177] It is our timeless guide as we navigate the life's troubled seas.
[time=181] It is as sound as the ages and as fresh as today's news.
[time=186] Today, Rick begins a new series entitled What the Bible Says About Life's Issues.
[time=191] The first study is What the Bible Says About Itself.
[time=195] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=199] Rick's text is Hebrews chapter 4 verses 12 and 13.
[time=205] On this first day in our new building, the sanctuary choir will be singing Great is the Lord.
[time=211] Other special music includes solos from Kathy Hawks and Kevin Road.
[time=219] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=225] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=229] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=234] Now, here's Rick.
[time=239] It's a joy to welcome you to this first worship service in the new home of the Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=246] by the very provision of God we meet here today.
[time=249] The Bible says Pastor Lantman would quote it when he prayed unless the Lord builds the house, day that labor, labor and vain.
[time=258] It was the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ that he would build his church.
[time=261] He didn't mean by that a building, particularly this one, but he meant that he would build a body of people who would bring glory and honor to his name.
[time=270] We are his church today if we glorify and honor his name.
[time=274] We welcome you to this worship service.
[time=277] We also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=282] We come today to declare that our God is a great God and great is the Lord.
[time=298] Praise the Lord, His holy and just Christ, how are we trust and love.
[time=306] Praise the Lord, His faithful and true.
[time=310] Highs were seeking grooves His love.
[time=314] Praise the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=327] God has seen praise.
[time=332] Praise the Lord.
[time=348] Praise the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=565] Praise the Lord.
[time=567] Praise the Lord and worthy of glory.
[time=1976] But the fact that the Bible declares it may be inadequate evidence for many of you.
[time=1981] Tonight at length we will ask the question and study.
[time=1984] Can I trust my Bible?
[time=1986] But may I just wipe your appetite this morning that the word of God has been born out in history is that which is divinely authentic.
[time=1996] Not the words of man but the very words of God.
[time=2000] As men would study it, it would withstand the attacks of all realms of society.
[time=2006] We believe the word of God is God's authentic word and it has stood the test of science.
[time=2014] Do you know that within the pages of the Bible there are scientific statements which are declared without explanation that were centuries even millennium I had of the known science of that day.
[time=2032] For example, it was not till 1492 that Columbus sailed the ocean blue that western men believed that the world was round.
[time=2041] Yet Job said 2,000 years before Christ that God stands above the sphere of the circle.
[time=2049] Scientific statements.
[time=2052] Do you know that there were no experts in anatomy and in human physiology in the days of Moses?
[time=2059] Yet Moses would declare in the book of Leviticus that life is in the blood and there was an understanding that was beyond the medical world of that day.
[time=2070] Science does not counterdict the scriptures.
[time=2073] It actually compliments them.
[time=2075] History bears the fact that the word of God is true.
[time=2080] In Israeli by the name of Fetterman, read his Old Testament and he came to Genesis.
[time=2086] He discovered that there was the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=2090] And it's the story about how fire and brimstone came down upon them and that out of the earth that belts forth fire.
[time=2099] This man began to think.
[time=2101] Well, the only explanation he could come up with is there must be some type of oil under the sight of Sodom and Gomorrah so that as that fire would erupt and come out it would give explanation.
[time=2115] In 1953, Fetterman, studying his Bible, believing its history, went to the site of Sodom and Gomorrah and Israel, sunk their first oil well and it was a gusher.
[time=2126] The historicity of the Bible authenticates that it is accurate and true.
[time=2131] Archaeology is one of the best testimonies as to the authenticity of Scripture.
[time=2137] One hundred years ago there was an Englishman by the name of William Ramsey.
[time=2143] It was later night and became Sir William Ramsey.
[time=2147] It was Ramsey's consistent theme that the scriptures could not be trusted.
[time=2156] And to prove that the scriptures could not be trusted, he went on in expedition as a scholar to what we call Asia Minor or Turkey.
[time=2166] And his point was to prove the inaccuracies of the history of Dr. Luke, the author of Luke and Acts.
[time=2175] And Ramsey made his study, and at the end of his investigation, William Ramsey dropped his mission of disproving the Bible and became a believer in Jesus Christ.
[time=2189] And archaeologists found the authenticity of the Bible to be true.
[time=2194] This book is divinely authentic.
[time=2199] It is the Word of God.
[time=2202] Secondly, the Bible says of itself, not only is it divinely authentic, it is dynamically active.
[time=2210] Here it says, "For the Word of God is living and active."
[time=2216] Many of you use a King James Bible.
[time=2218] It uses the Word quick.
[time=2220] Someone who is quick in the King James language is not somebody who plays point guard for the pistons, but somebody who is quick is somebody who is alive.
[time=2229] Some days we're not a real quick church, but today we're quick, we are alive.
[time=2234] That word living doesn't actually mean that somehow this book starts breathing and it comes alive like a Steven Spielberg movie.
[time=2243] But by living, it means that it has within it the potential to give life.
[time=2250] Jesus said in John chapter 6, verse 63, "The words that I speak unto you, they are life themselves." That as we come to the Word of God, they have the potential to give life.
[time=2266] Many of you have experienced the life giving power of God's Word.
[time=2272] Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone,
[time=2278] but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord thy God." That in life there is more than simply physical existence.
[time=2288] There is more that comes than eating food.
[time=2292] There has to be that which gives life to the inner man, to the inner woman, to the person, to the spirit and the soul.
[time=2300] And this is the bread of life.
[time=2306] T.S. Eliot said, "Where is the life in all of this living?"
[time=2314] How profound.
[time=2316] We go through life day after day, sunrise to sunset, midnight to noon.
[time=2322] We are living, but where is the life?
[time=2327] Jesus said, "I am come that you might have life
[time=2333] and that you might have it more abundantly." Those people were already alive.
[time=2339] They had bio-offs.
[time=2341] They had physical life, but within them there was no abundance.
[time=2344] There was no meaning.
[time=2346] There was not that which gave life its purpose.
[time=2349] And so Jesus would say the words that I speak unto you, they give life.
[time=2355] This book gives life.
[time=2360] Just a few moments ago we had the privilege of hearing testimonies of people who came to Christ in our Convocation Center.
[time=2369] Some of those stories are exciting because you can see the day tonight and the night today turn around
[time=2380] in transformation of lives.
[time=2383] Jesus Christ's Word is revolutionary.
[time=2387] It changes lives.
[time=2389] It changed Sir William Ramsey to a hostile unbeliever to a lifelong follower of Jesus Christ.
[time=2397] It is dynamically active.
[time=2400] That word active is a Greek word that comes directly in English as our word energy.
[time=2406] It is a word that speaks that it has not only the power to give life, but it's an energizing force.
[time=2414] It has power.
[time=2416] The Apostle Paul would say, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is the power of God on the salvation."
[time=2427] In this book there is life changing power.
[time=2434] It can change your values.
[time=2436] It can change your thinking.
[time=2437] It can change your philosophy.
[time=2439] It can change your temperament.
[time=2441] It can change your marriage.
[time=2442] It can change your home.
[time=2445] But it is not a magic wand that we can wave it over everyone's head and suddenly their life is changed.
[time=2452] Your life is changed by the power of this book as you hear it,
[time=2458] read it, study it, meditate on it, memorize it, and most
[time=2465] importantly obey it.
[time=2468] Yesterday in this auditorium a young man was married.
[time=2473] Many Paul was a man who grew up with a very difficult background.
[time=2477] He had made all the wrong terms in life, but there came a day in his life when he gave his heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=2485] Congressman Coates was here and he said, "Rick, I got a document come across my desk.
[time=2492] This man is being recommended for the Annapolis Naval Academy.
[time=2497] I looked at this guy's background and there's no way I could recommend him until I read down and his commanding officer when he had been in the military said, "Something happened in this young man's life that we cannot explain.
[time=2511] He is a different man and we recommend him without the slightest reservation.
[time=2517] What can happen in young man's life that would say you can't even consider him till they say we've got to have him?" Power came into his life and it was changed when he gave his heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=2532] God's word has power.
[time=2536] He spoke the world and it came in to order.
[time=2542] Jesus spoke his word and the demons fled.
[time=2547] Jesus spoke his word and the raging sea became calm and tranquil.
[time=2554] He spoke his word and the whale swallowed Jonah.
[time=2563] He spoke his word and Lazarus, who was dead, came back to life.
[time=2570] He has spoken his word and it is living.
[time=2574] It is dynamic.
[time=2576] It is life changing in its power.
[time=2580] Peter was a bewildered denier of Christ until he saw the resurrected Lord and suddenly
[time=2590] he became the most brazen, outspoken representative of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2599] His life was changed when he saw the resurrection because there is a living dynamic power in God's word.
[time=2608] Thirdly, the Bible says about itself that it is diserningly accurate.
[time=2614] There is an illustration here.
[time=2616] It says that it is sharper than a two-edged sword.
[time=2619] There were various kinds of swords that would be used in military combat.
[time=2624] There was the big, long, single-edged sword that wasn't much to cut, but you could beat somebody with it.
[time=2631] And there would be men who would go into battle and they would carry these large swords so that they could beat against the shield of the enemy.
[time=2640] But then on their belt, they would carry a smaller sword that would be sharp, that would be two-edged, that was for the hand-to-hand combat.
[time=2650] No longer were there shields in armor, but this was hand-to-hand.
[time=2655] Here the Bible says the word of God was sharper than that sword designed for
[time=2661] hand-to-hand combat.
[time=2663] It was sharper than that weapon that the soldier by his campfire at night would meticulously sharpen back and forth, stroking iron against iron.
[time=2672] God's word is sharper than that.
[time=2675] But it goes beyond its military illustration and becomes medical.
[time=2680] You begin not just to see a sword that's used in battle.
[time=2683] You begin to see the precursor of the scalpel.
[time=2687] As it says that there is a sword, a knife that was sharp enough, then to do surgical procedure of separating the joint, the bone structure from the moral within that bone.
[time=2700] Delicacy precision with the hand in the instrument.
[time=2707] Using that illustration, the author of Hebrews under the inspiration of God says this book is disirningly accurate.
[time=2715] It has the ability to penetrate, first of all.
[time=2719] There are hard hearts here today.
[time=2723] Many of us have become angry at God, bitter at churches, resentful of Christians, hostile towards anyone else.
[time=2733] And our hearts are hard.
[time=2736] But God says his word can penetrate hard hearts.
[time=2742] I came to this church 11 years ago as the youth pastor.
[time=2746] There was a good group of high school students.
[time=2749] Some of them were just enthusiastic about the Lord.
[time=2752] Some of them were in the middle, but there was one guy.
[time=2755] He would sit in the back of the high school Sunday school class.
[time=2758] He wore black pants and a black shirt and he folded his arms like this every Sunday morning.
[time=2765] He had the ability to lean back further in a chair than anybody had ever seen.
[time=2769] To denote I'm bored with all of this, it was hard.
[time=2773] That young man today teaches our outreach of Angela's an explosion class because God's word could penetrate a hard heart.
[time=2786] And when it gets on the inside, it has the ability to separate our very thoughts
[time=2792] from our intentions.
[time=2794] The word thought primarily thinks of the mind, the intellect, and the intention moves from the intellect to the heart, the emotion.
[time=2805] And what it says here is that God's word has the ability to separate our thoughts one from another.
[time=2812] You know, there are times when we say things.
[time=2815] We say them for a good reason, but we really said them for a secondary reason.
[time=2820] I'm sure you've done that.
[time=2822] Oh, thank you for inviting us over.
[time=2825] We would just love to do that, but we really are busy that night.
[time=2830] Honey, we're busy, aren't we that night?
[time=2833] Yes, we're busy that night.
[time=2835] You've said something, but what you were saying was not accurate.
[time=2841] Other times we bait others by the things that we've said.
[time=2845] I like to work with wood in this past month.
[time=2847] I've worked on a woodworking project.
[time=2849] And when you work on things yourself, you see all the flaws and you see the mistakes.
[time=2854] And I say to people, you know, there's a mistake over here and a little mistake over there.
[time=2859] You know why I say that?
[time=2860] So they can say, oh, no, that looks great.
[time=2865] I wasn't worried about whether they thought the mistake was.
[time=2869] I wanted to hear them say, no, it looks just fine.
[time=2874] We say one thing within our heart, we mean another thing.
[time=2881] God says He has the ability to discern what we say from what we really mean.
[time=2888] And many of us are saying, well, the reason I'm not following Christ is because maybe it's hypocrites in the church.
[time=2896] But the real reason God knows is that is you want to hold on to your own life.
[time=2900] Oh, the reason I don't come to church and follow Christ is the Bible is full of contradictions.
[time=2906] One man wisely put it, our trouble with the Bible is not that it counterdicks itself, but it counterdicks us.
[time=2915] And it's not that we have problems with the Bible.
[time=2918] We have problems with the Bible putting a claim on our life.
[time=2922] Mark Twain said, it's not the parts of the Bible that I don't understand the trouble me.
[time=2927] It's the parts that I do.
[time=2930] And many of us have put God at a distance and we put the issue of, is the Bible really accurate?
[time=2937] It is.
[time=2938] We say it's not so that we have a smokescreen.
[time=2942] But God's Word can penetrate and it can separate the very thoughts that we think and the very intentions of our heart.
[time=2950] It is discerningly accurate.
[time=2953] He goes on and builds on this in verse 13.
[time=2957] "Nothing in all creation is hidden from the sight of God.
[time=2962] Everything is uncovered and laid bare.
[time=2966] It exposes us." I had the privilege of going on a medical internship with a friend back in the spring and going into surgery.
[time=2975] It was an interesting day in my life.
[time=2978] We went into a surgical table and here was a lady laying on this table unconscious,
[time=2984] covered up with all kinds of these green gowns, but there was a part this big exposed right in her abdomen.
[time=2993] The doctor said, now we're going to take out this lady's gallbladder.
[time=2998] Took a knife, scalpel, cut right down and all sudden a layer of tissue opened.
[time=3005] He said, now that is a muscle and we'll burn through this.
[time=3008] And he took a little other instrument and he burnt right through it and the muscle just rolled right back.
[time=3012] And then he took a little probe and he said, now Rick, that's a lung right under there.
[time=3017] That over there is a kidney and right there is the gallbladder we want.
[time=3022] And it's like biology 101.
[time=3024] I mean, here it is.
[time=3027] And I thought, I'm being exposed.
[time=3030] I haven't seen anything yet.
[time=3032] He lengthened the incision about this far.
[time=3035] And he said, now one of the things you always do when you take out a gallbladder is that you check
[time=3041] the intestines and he reaches inside this incision about elbow height and pulls out the intestines
[time=3050] and lays them out and says, Paul, these really look good.
[time=3061] That's what you call being exposed.
[time=3067] The Bible says that God cuts through us layer by layer until he exposes the very insides of us.
[time=3077] Not in terms of our body, but in terms of our heart and in terms of our soul.
[time=3085] And it says there's not one thing in all of creation that is hidden from him.
[time=3092] Everything is exposed.
[time=3094] What you thought this morning when you took a shower, God knows that thought.
[time=3099] What you thought this morning when there were people crossing the street and you couldn't get into the parking lot,
[time=3106] God knows that thought.
[time=3111] What you thought this morning when you came in and somebody had told you that the carpet was powder blue and that's your favorite color and you came in and it wasn't powder blue.
[time=3120] God knows every thought.
[time=3122] God knows every emotion that you've gone through.
[time=3125] The laughter, the anger, God knows it.
[time=3130] God knows the secret things that you thought about a person this morning.
[time=3135] He knows it.
[time=3136] It is all as exposed as the intestines to a surgeon.
[time=3142] There are three words here that describe it.
[time=3145] First it says in verse 13, there is nothing that is hidden.
[time=3150] I don't know if you were a hider.
[time=3152] I was a hider when I was a little boy.
[time=3154] I wasn't a very smart one, but I was a hider.
[time=3157] Do you remember the old days when they used to deliver milk to your house?
[time=3161] Maybe some companies still do that.
[time=3163] But we had a milk box outside the door and the milkman would come and he'd pick up the empty bottles and put the old ones there.
[time=3169] I'm a first grader and I'm bringing my papers home and I knew the consequence of these papers.
[time=3176] The teacher had marked a few comments and I didn't know how to read, but I knew the representative letter F and what that meant.
[time=3184] And I was certain that if my dad and mom saw that paper, I'd be in trouble.
[time=3190] So I said, I'll hide that.
[time=3192] So I folded up those papers and the whole way home, I thought, where should I put them?
[time=3196] I got home, being a brilliant first grader, I said, I'll hide them in the milk box.
[time=3200] Stuck them and put them in there next to the bottles and I said, well, that takes care of that.
[time=3205] Got away with that one.
[time=3207] I wasn't very smart.
[time=3209] Next morning at 6 a.m., the milkman comes, he took the bottles but he didn't take my papers.
[time=3214] 7 a.m., my mom goes out to get the fresh milk and finds these papers and suddenly that morning for breakfast, I had day old school papers.
[time=3223] I couldn't hide them.
[time=3225] You're saying, well, that's because you're not very smart.
[time=3227] I'll hide them better if I were you.
[time=3229] Oh, I learned to hide better.
[time=3231] When I was in the third grade, I had to take vitamins, but I couldn't swallow.
[time=3237] You know, I could swallow food, but these little iron pills, they tasted terrible.
[time=3241] I was smart.
[time=3242] I'd go like this.
[time=3244] Keep the pill in my hand, slight of hand.
[time=3247] Take a drink, reach down, stick that pill in the cup of my pants.
[time=3251] And I'd go brush my teeth.
[time=3253] My mother was so proud she never needed to tell me, go brush my teeth.
[time=3256] I'd take a little pill out of my pant cup and I'd drop it right down the overflow of the drain.
[time=3260] Work for two months.
[time=3262] Then the drain plugged up.
[time=3264] I come home and my mom says to my father that the drain's plugged up.
[time=3271] My dad walks in there and he says, it smells like iron.
[time=3274] I think it smells like iron, huh, dad?
[time=3279] He took that drain apart and here came two months where the pill.
[time=3283] Do you ever think you're going to hide something?
[time=3287] God said there's not one thing you can hide from him today.
[time=3291] The psalmist said, where shall I flee from God?
[time=3294] If I run to the mountains, he beat me there.
[time=3297] If I go to the depths of the sea, he's there.
[time=3301] You can't hide from God today.
[time=3304] It says that everything is visible to him.
[time=3308] Nothing is hidden from his sight.
[time=3310] Everything is uncovered.
[time=3313] And then this word uncovered and laid bare.
[time=3319] That word like bear is an interesting one.
[time=3322] It was used in three different ways.
[time=3325] The first way that this word was used of the hunter who has captured his prey, he has killed it and now he is skinning the animal and it is exposed.
[time=3335] It is laid bare.
[time=3337] There's a second way the word is used as well.
[time=3341] This way is a wrestler.
[time=3343] The wrestler who is able to grab his opponent and pull him and pull him
[time=3350] until they bring his body face to face to put him on the mat.
[time=3355] The word actually means face to face.
[time=3360] But the third word, the third way the word is used is the most descriptive.
[time=3365] This word is used of the convicted criminal who would be led from the place of judgment
[time=3373] to the place of execution.
[time=3376] When the individual would be led through town, they would have his hands tied behind his back
[time=3382] and a belt about his waist.
[time=3384] And on that belt there would be a place to hold a stick with a dagger at the end of the stick.
[time=3390] And the dagger would be point up under the man's chin so that as he walked through the city
[time=3398] from the point of judgment to the place of execution he could not drop his head in shame
[time=3404] or conceal it in embarrassment but it was forced up by a dagger.
[time=3411] When God says our face, someday will come face to face with him.
[time=3420] His word is discerningly accurate.
[time=3425] There is not one thing that we can hide, that we can cover up, that we can conceal from him.
[time=3432] There is not anything so hard that his word cannot penetrate, we will come face to face.
[time=3441] The fourth thing the Bible says about itself, I will steal from the Old Testament from Psalm 19.
[time=3449] Just listen as I read this for you.
[time=3454] The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.
[time=3461] The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
[time=3465] The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart.
[time=3469] The commandments of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
[time=3476] The fear of the Lord is pure enduring forever.
[time=3479] The ordinances of the Lord are sure and all together righteous.
[time=3483] Note this now.
[time=3484] They are more precious than gold, yes than much pure gold, and they are sweeter than honey
[time=3490] and honey from the honeycomb.
[time=3492] The Word of God is delightfully attractive.
[time=3499] It's been our privilege today to present the Bible hour from our new worship center.
[time=3510] The music was from our sanctuary choir and soloist Kevin Rowe and Kathy Hawks.
[time=3515] The message was from God's Word presented by our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3519] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3526] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3528] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3536] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3539] I ask you to come in and cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3544] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3548] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3552] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3560] To receive a copy of your decision or the devotional booklet "Closer Walk", please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3572] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1364
[time=3578] or use the sermon title "What the Bible Says About Itself".
[time=3582] And please enclose a gift of three dollars to help to pray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3588] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3597] Perhaps you have thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3601] Why not do it today?
[time=3603] I know it would be an encouragement to pastor Rick and the entire Bible...
