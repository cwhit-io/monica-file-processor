[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] I'm afraid Lucifer is inside of me.
[time=123] The final dream sequence shows the Lord Jesus Christ, fantasizing of sexual relationships with Mary Magdalene.
[time=145] Proponents of this film hide themselves behind the First Amendment and say no one should criticize the film until they see it.
[time=153] Yet we are wise enough not to expose our children to child molestation in drugs until they've experienced that.
[time=161] A number of months ago, the deceased mayor of Chicago, Harold Washington was depicted in a most defaming way, dressed in women's undergarments.
[time=170] All of society rejected that and the picture was pulled from the art museum as being tasteless and offensive.
[time=177] And now, this film wants to depict the Lord Jesus Christ in an even more grossly blasphemous way, and we cannot agree to hide it behind the First Amendment.
[time=200] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=207] We're glad you could join us on this very special dedication weekend.
[time=210] The fewer over the film, the last temptation of Christ has brought our society out of its position of neutrality.
[time=216] It is no longer possible to be indifferent about Jesus Christ.
[time=220] One must either defend or deny His deity in the face of such an assault.
[time=225] Jesus was either a man like all of us or a man like none of us.
[time=230] Either He collapsed under the bombardment of emotional and sexual temptation as every other human, or He deflected their deadly blows with the shield of His impeccable character.
[time=240] Who do you say that I am, Mass Jesus of Peter?
[time=243] And now each of us must answer that same question.
[time=246] Who do you think Jesus Christ to be?
[time=249] Please locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=254] On this dedication Sunday, the Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra will feature the hymn "Forever King."
[time=262] In addition, our good friends, Keith and Star Prodigum will be ministering in music.
[time=268] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=276] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=281] Now here's Rick.
[time=283] Welcome our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=285] As the Bible Hour goes beyond these walls to share the message that Jesus Christ is both Lord and God.
[time=292] Thank you for coming to worship with us today.
[time=306] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=554] [APPLAUSE]
[time=561] Great to sing of the King.
[time=563] Let's continue to do that as we worship the King, hymn number ten.
[time=567] We'll sing together the first, second, and fourth stanzas.
[time=576] [MUSIC - 97 seconds]
[time=690] Let's pause now and prepare our hearts for the ministry of music as Keith Rotigan comes to minister to us.
[time=696] We sing and we get actively involved that way. Now we need to get our minds and hearts tuned to the message that he has in his song, Keith Rotigan.
[time=705] [MUSIC - 216 seconds]
[time=941] [APPLAUSE]
[time=949] Thank you, Keith. Psalm 27, the promise to the believer that God would be our light and our salvation.
[time=957] It is our privilege to know him. It is our responsibility to declare him. Our church is not but one other mission point, a point on the globe to share the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=969] We send out missionaries and yet there is coming a day when that becomes more difficult. Foreign countries are not as open as they used to be to receiving outsiders, particularly Americans, to come and to teach a religion that is different to them.
[time=983] So there must be new ways to share the gospel of Jesus Christ. One of those is through athletics. And we have the privilege of being here today to hear from David Burnham. He will be speaking in our three o'clock service. And I have asked him to come and give a report on world outreach during the 24th Olympiad. This is my pastor and mentor David Burnham.
[time=1011] So bright and yet so brief, the Olympic flame would burn. And 13,000 athletes gathered from 160 nations to celebrate the greatest physical achievement in athletics that the world can announce.
[time=1028] And at the 24th Olympiad, these athletes came seeking the gold, the silver and the bronze. And it is a bright moment when that Olympic flame burns, when that great stadium cheers and over 2 billion people watch these athletes come to perform within the discipline that they have given a lifetime of training too.
[time=1050] It is an exciting event. But so is it an exciting event to come to a dedication. When you have given of yourselves to come to this place of service, as God has raised up a proclaimer of the Word of God in Pastor Hawks.
[time=1064] It's an exciting time. So the Olympics are truly an exciting time. And yet in the midst of that challenge, there were athletes who came representing their nation, representing their families, representing themselves.
[time=1079] There were exciting moments. There was a tremendous excitement as you had watched the Evan's girl as she would swim and then turn and her face would radiate the joy. She had set a record. The Olympic medal was hers.
[time=1092] America was proud of that moment. We watched in the tremendous challenge between Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis. It seemingly escalated until finally that 100 meter challenge was run.
[time=1105] And when Ben Johnson raised that hand in victory, it was quite a moment.
[time=1111] But so was the next day, quite a moment when the announcement came that steroids had been found and that Ben Johnson would be stripped of his Olympic medal.
[time=1124] There truly is, in the Olympic contest, a challenge of values. And there were athletes who won and there were athletes who lost. But in the midst of their spiritual needs, sometimes people would question, is there a place of reaching athletes for Christ?
[time=1145] Ten days before the Olympics, we gathered in an international sports Congress, a World Congress of Sports to bring together over 520 delegates from 120 nations to seek a prize that was not gold or silver or bronze.
[time=1162] But for ten days before the Olympics, we brought together representatives of sport ministries. Those who shared a burden of heart, former athletes, those who work with athletes now, to know that athletics is one of the vocabularies that reaches the world.
[time=1178] Music speaks to the world, and so does sports. We know that through the Olympics. But we trained in ten days how to witness, how to share. And we watch God ban hearts together. I want to thank many of you for praying.
[time=1193] Because coming from such a diverse background with different ministries, God brought lives together and he bended our hearts.
[time=1201] 65 chaplains were trained to work in the Olympic Village. That's never happened before from the evangelical cause to go in to the Olympic Village and meet not simply physical but spiritual needs.
[time=1214] There is a devotional need that athletes have from the world. In three days, all of the Bibles that had been brought in Chinese were all gone.
[time=1225] We saw athletes come and watch videos and spiritually open their hearts to Jesus Christ. Our last session we joined hands and arms, and I linked my arm with a woman who had won three gold medals previously.
[time=1239] She worked in a prison ministry. She served as a chaplain. And as we linked arms, I recognize that athletes who have been a part of the Olympics can go on.
[time=1250] Because as she served in that Olympic Village, there were athletes who have won today, and athletes who lost, who came and asked her about the greatest race of all, seeking an eternal prize.
[time=1263] I want to thank you for praying for us. And I want you to know that throughout the world, there are those that are naming the name of Jesus Christ today, one man who spoke Russian, was working with Russian speaking players and Russian speaking officials.
[time=1278] But his background was not sports. He had worked in the seaports dealing with Russian sailors, but he came to help us because he spoke Russian. He came back and he said a very interesting thing.
[time=1290] He said, "I discovered something. I know very little about sports. I'm not an athlete myself." But the same message that I gave to the sailors I could give to the athletes, it's the same message.
[time=1303] Jesus Christ is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. So bright and so brief that Olympic flame will burn and then die. But what is done for Jesus Christ and the prize of a high calling of winning men and women to Christ, that will last forever.
[time=1325] Hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour. Today is the formal dedication of our new sanctuary and we have had a tremendous weekend. Rick, we began on Friday evening with a marvelous concert with Nielsen and Young, and then last night we gathered together again here to meet with some of the former staff members of our church.
[time=1344] And it was a great homecoming because amongst those former staff members was our first pastor, David Jeremiah, and we're delighted that he could come back.
[time=1352] It's good to see him again. Well today marks the dedication of our sanctuary and with that some changes here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1361] We formally had two morning worship services. Now we're able to combine our church family and the one large assembly. Our auditorium seats are approximately 2,000 people and we have a morning worship service each Sunday morning at 9.45 a.m.
[time=1376] We surround that with Sunday school, some meet before and some after, but our worship service that we would like to invite you to is at 9.45 each Sunday morning.
[time=1386] We've been talking about the dedication for weeks and we've neglected to tell you about a special event coming up on November the 6th.
[time=1393] Rick, we're excited to receive a call from Stephen Maria Gardner who now live in Fresno, California. They're going to come back and give a concert on Sunday morning November 6th and then a premier of their new record album that evening at 6 p.m.
[time=1409] That's Sunday evening November 6th.
[time=1412] I certainly want to invite all of you friends who are within driving distance of Fort Wayne to come and join us if you haven't seen the new sanctuary. What a great opportunity that would be on Sunday morning or Sunday night are both November the 6th when Steve and Maria are here with us to premier their new album.
[time=1430] Today I want to encourage you to write to us so that we can send you an excellent booklet written by Erwin Lutzer on the review of the film The Last Temptation of Christ.
[time=1441] That'll be much of our study here today as you listen to the message, but we wanted you to have something in print.
[time=1447] Erwin Lutzer is the pastor of Moody Memorial Church in Chicago, Illinois. He is a great Bible teacher, an excellent preacher and a very capable writer.
[time=1457] His booklet gives you what the Bible says about The Last Temptation of Christ and also what you and I can be doing and thinking and reacting to the fur over this film.
[time=1468] So we want to encourage you to write and we'll send you a booklet just as quickly as you write.
[time=1474] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour 7400E State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour 7400E State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1493] Thank you, Pete and thank you again for joining us here today by way of television for the dedication services of our new sanctuary.
[time=1501] Again, we want to encourage you to write and to join us in person. May God bless you as we study God's Word together today.
[time=1531] [MUSIC - 424 seconds]
[time=1968] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1976] Thank you, Keith and Starr, with their voices, with their very posture, they declare that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=1986] Our God and our Father, we meet in this place today to magnify the name of Jesus, to exalt Him and to honor Him above every name.
[time=1996] We do bow in our hearts and we do confess with our tongues that He is Lord, and we've come to worship Him today.
[time=2004] And as we meet on this weekend of dedication, Father, we dedicate this place, and more importantly, we dedicate our hearts to you.
[time=2012] You've given us a new church, and with that a new beginning and new opportunities, and we today want to be found faithful in serving you.
[time=2023] We found faithful in praying, we found faithful in our dependence, and so we pray today, Spirit of the Living God, fall fresh on me, Spirit of the Living God, fall fresh on me, melt me, mold me, fill me, use me.
[time=2049] Spirit of the Living God, fall fresh on me.
[time=2054] Father, we ask for the blessing of your Spirit in this place, in these moments, to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ only, in His name we pray, amen.
[time=2071] It is troublingly ironic that during the very months that we were preparing these services of dedication of a worship center to the glory of Jesus Christ and to the advance of His gospel, that there was also preparation out of Hollywood California for the release of a film, The Last Temptation of Christ.
[time=2094] We would be planning that which we could do to honor and elevate His name as King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and a director would be refining a script to portray Him as nothing more than a man laden with the worst of temptations and succumbing to them all in His fantasies.
[time=2113] Ironic, is it? Or is it really actually a reflection of the times in which we live, that our world and even our American society is becoming polarized over Jesus Christ?
[time=2127] And He brings to our attention this very morning those words that He spoke to His disciples when the Lord Jesus asked them a simple question, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2142] He had asked, "Who do men say that I am?" and they had given him the Gallup Poll of that day.
[time=2147] Oh, some thought that he was Elijah, others Jeremiah or one of the prophets come back to life, perhaps even the recently beheaded John the Baptist.
[time=2157] But the question was not enough to ask, "What is it the society would say about the Lord Jesus Christ?"
[time=2164] He would ask a personal question, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2170] And my prayer this very morning is that the Spirit of God would trouble your heart and force you to answer, not a social question.
[time=2179] Who do they say? But a personal question, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2185] If you have a copy of the Scriptures with you today, I invite you to open them to Hebrews 4th chapter and verses 14 through 16.
[time=2194] Last week in our first Sunday in this building, we studied chapter 4 verses 12 and 13, and we saw the authority of the Word of God.
[time=2203] Now God's Spirit moves from the authority of His Word to the authority of His Son, Jesus Christ.
[time=2211] During the early days of the news releases that would come out about the last temptation of Christ, I refrained from responding.
[time=2219] Because I wanted this day, our day of dedication, to be reserved for one message, that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=2229] Society has done us the disservice of dishonoring His name, but they have done us the service of bringing the whole world to ask the question, "Who is this Jesus?"
[time=2240] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14.
[time=2244] Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
[time=2257] For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness, but we have one who has been tempted.
[time=2267] And every way, just as we are, yet without sin.
[time=2274] Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in the time of our trouble.
[time=2289] In this passage, the writer of Hebrews is taking a brief moment to capstone four chapters of argumentation.
[time=2297] The thesis of what he has already written is simply this, that Jesus Christ is both Lord and God.
[time=2304] That he has given the very names of God, that he possessed the very attributes of God, that he is positioned in the position of God above all of creation, even the heavenly creation of the angels.
[time=2318] And then he declares the authority of the Word of God in verses 12 and 13, that that which he has spoken can be trusted, that it is true.
[time=2328] And now he would declare the Lordship of Jesus Christ, bringing together that dichotomy that the human mind cannot hold without spiritual insight, that Jesus was both fully human and fully God at the same time.
[time=2345] And we even come to the temptation of Jesus, that point of social concern today.
[time=2352] In this passage, I've discovered from my own life three things that I should know about the Lord Jesus Christ and how we can come to him.
[time=2361] First of all, the Lord Jesus is one to whom we can come with great confidence.
[time=2367] Verse 14, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly, confidently to that which we profess."
[time=2380] In this day and age, we are seeing the bombardment of attack from the liberal scholars to the media, to pulpits today, to the question, is God's Word trustworthy?
[time=2391] And is the person of Jesus Christ all that we've said that he has been over these centuries?
[time=2398] And here we come to a statement that we can hold to the Word of God and to the person of Christ with confidence, hold with confidence, that which we profess today, that Jesus is the person of God.
[time=2409] That Jesus is Lord.
[time=2411] Here he is given three different descriptions.
[time=2414] First he is called the great high priest.
[time=2417] In the history of the Jewish people, God would make a new covenant with them, and out of that covenant would come a priest to it.
[time=2424] And there would be appointed one man who would be the chief priest.
[time=2430] Particular amongst his responsibilities was he would do one thing one time a year that no one else would ever do.
[time=2438] And that would be to enter into the temple, to go through its outer court, through its holy place, and actually enter into the holy of holies.
[time=2447] He would do that one time per year.
[time=2450] It was the day of atonement, Yom Kippur.
[time=2453] It was the day when he would go in as a representative of an entire nation, and there in the holy of holies, he would make a sacrifice as a covering for the sins of a nation.
[time=2467] That man was called the high priest.
[time=2472] Jesus now is called the great high priest.
[time=2477] He is put in position above the only man in the history of Israel who would represent and mediate between the nation and God, the high priest.
[time=2487] The high priest now comes Jesus, the great high priest, the one who would mediate between God and man.
[time=2497] Scholars have noted the phrase that he has passed through, or he has ascended into the heavens, and the word is plural.
[time=2505] It could be that the writer here is drawing a parallel between the ancient temple with its three particular rooms, the outer court, the holy place, and then the holy of holies.
[time=2519] Jesus, representative of man, yet by character and spirit God, would move through the heavens.
[time=2528] The atmosphere, as we know it, that which we breathe, where the birds fly in the heavens, the first, then the second heavens, outer space, the stars, the moon, the constellations that we've only begun to explore.
[time=2542] And then beyond that second heaven to the third heaven, to the very throne of God, where only Jesus could go as God himself.
[time=2550] And it represents the three realms of the temple, the three heavens, Jesus, the high priest, making intercession for us.
[time=2561] And he alone is worthy, not only to enter the holy of holies, but to enter on his own merits, the very throne room of God himself.
[time=2571] In the providence of God, he would send his son, Jesus Christ, according to Paul, born in the fullness of time.
[time=2580] That phrase refers to God's hand controlling history, and he was never out of sync with the counsel of his own will.
[time=2587] And so in the fullness of time, God would send his son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins.
[time=2593] And then in 70 AD, Titus, a Roman general, would march in and he would besiege Jerusalem, and he would destroy its walls, and he would even crush and destroy its temple, never to be rebuilt to this day.
[time=2609] But you see in the fullness of time, there was no longer a need for a temple.
[time=2613] Where you see there was one who would take and make intercession for us, not only in the holy of holies, but in heaven itself, Jesus Christ, God becomes man, and he becomes our great high priest.
[time=2627] Secondly, he is described as Jesus.
[time=2630] That gives to us his human name, his human identification.
[time=2635] Was Jesus a man? Yes, he was. He was human. He was a man who experienced the great moments of joy in his life.
[time=2644] He was a man that knew the heartache, the death of a loved one, Lazarus.
[time=2648] He was a man that knew what it was to adventure to the mountaintops. He also knew those valley experiences of life.
[time=2656] He knew what it was to be hungry, to be weary, to be thirsty. There was a human side to him.
[time=2662] But his human side was the physical body of Christ that was indwelt by a spirit that was not human at all.
[time=2670] It was a spirit that existed as God in eternity past, and for a moment in time entered into a human body, God in human flesh.
[time=2681] That very concept was formed to a world of that day.
[time=2686] The Greeks considered the gods to live in a world that they called apothea, from which we get apothea.
[time=2693] And they drilled in the land of intermediate, we would call them space cadets.
[time=2698] I mean, they were just out of it. They were not in touch with life and with human world.
[time=2702] They just floated along in their own realm of intermediate.
[time=2707] Plutarch, famous for his writing of the live, said, "It is blasphemous to involve the gods in the affairs of this world."
[time=2716] And yet the Bible would tell us that the word became flesh, and he dwelt amongst us.
[time=2725] And he bore the name Jesus Savior.
[time=2729] Then there is this third description that is given, "Son of God." There are those that play word games, and they come to the phrase, "Son of God." And they would say, "Well, that means that Jesus really wasn't God. He was just Son of God."
[time=2745] And so they have a big God, and then they have a little God, a Son of God.
[time=2750] And they try to make the words say that which they don't, that Jesus was something less than fully God.
[time=2757] It is always important to use words, not as you choose to use them, or even as you use them in a society,
[time=2765] but as you study scripture to understand what is it that that culture meant by the words that they use.
[time=2772] You see, various societies use words in different ways.
[time=2776] We were in Jamaica this past summer. A group of us work in a small town called Bull Savannah.
[time=2782] It is a very small town.
[time=2785] We had gone there in February, spent about ten minutes, and when I came back, the ladies who sold goods on the streets remembered me, remembered me my name, and brought up the little biscuit that I said I had liked six months ago.
[time=2798] I mean, this is small town.
[time=2800] And as we went through the town, we literally got to know everybody, and we would joke with them.
[time=2805] And as we were going through the town on one day, we'd say to everybody, "Hi, this is Jay. Jay's running for mayor." And we would all laugh that Jay was going to become the mayor of Bull Savannah.
[time=2816] And we were chuckling and laughing, and they were laughing too.
[time=2819] Do you know why they were laughing?
[time=2821] They had never heard of a mayor, M-A-Y-O-R, as a government official.
[time=2826] They heard the word mayor, and they spelled it M-A-R-E like a female horse, but they don't have horses. They only have donkeys.
[time=2834] And we're walking through town, Jay for donkey, Jay for-- and we're laughing and they're laughing.
[time=2839] We weren't laughing at the same thing.
[time=2842] Words may mean different things from the context in which they are spoken.
[time=2849] As you come to Scripture, don't take a word and say, "Oh, I think that word means in a sign of our own definition."
[time=2856] We have to assign it the definition of the culture of that day.
[time=2861] How then do we know the culture of that day?
[time=2864] The Bible is a great commentary on itself.
[time=2867] In John chapter 5, Jesus is speaking with the religious leaders of His day.
[time=2873] And in John chapter 5, verse 17, Jesus said, "My father is always working to this very day, I too am working."
[time=2885] Now, Jesus just identified God as His Father.
[time=2890] Now, verse 18 gives definition of that father-son relationship in the culture of the Hebrew world.
[time=2897] For this reason, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him.
[time=2902] Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal to God.
[time=2913] You see, in the language of that day and really in the language of our day, the word "son" does not denote that which is inferior, that which is partial, that which is miniature too.
[time=2925] The word "son" gives definition to one who is identical in character and in substance.
[time=2932] And here are the Scriptures declared that with confidence we can trust that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
[time=2942] He is one to whom we can come today with great confidence.
[time=2947] He is also one to whom we can come for great compassion.
[time=2952] Verse 15, "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness, but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet He was without sin."
[time=2971] Jesus Christ was God eternal, temporarily coming into human form, and the Bible says He was tempted in all points just as we are.
[time=2988] And the point of all of that is that He is able to sympathize with us.
[time=2992] The writer here uses a double negative. It says that we do not have a high priest who is unable, so if you take out the knot and you take out the un, you come to a positive statement, we have one who is able to sympathize with us today.
[time=3008] You know, there is an old Indian adage that you never criticize a man until you walk three moons in his moccasins. What would it be like to actually walk in another person's experience over a generation ago, a young man determined that he would know how hard it was in the south to be a black man?
[time=3027] But he was a white man. How would he learn of that suffering? How would he really know firsthand?
[time=3033] And so John Howard Griffith would take a pigment-altering pill that would alter the very color of his skin, and he took it until his skin turned darker, darker and darker.
[time=3043] And he went from the comfort of the north as a white man to the heart of the most prejudiced part of one state in the south, and now not as a white man, but visually as a black man.
[time=3053] He would live, and he would suffer, and he would discover what it was like to be by the title of his book, Black Like Me.
[time=3063] Lord Jesus Christ would know, because he knows all his God, what we would feel, what would our be our point of breaking?
[time=3072] But it was not enough for him to know, because we would stand back and say, "Oh, nobody knows how I feel today."
[time=3079] And so Jesus entered into a human body, and he was tempted on all points just as we are.
[time=3088] It is common for many of us at a point of great hurt, either grief or anger to utter the words, "Nobody else really knows how I feel."
[time=3100] May I not argue with you, but say this to comfort you. There are others who know how you feel.
[time=3109] If you're, today, facing the death of your spouse, you are not the first one to face the death of a spouse.
[time=3117] There are others who would know how you feel. If you today are unemployed, you are not the first to lose a job.
[time=3124] There are others who would know how you feel. But not only are there others, there is one, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would know of your pain today.
[time=3135] For you see, he was born of a question birth. There were those that say, "Oh Jesus, you mean Mary's illegitimate son?"
[time=3145] Jesus would know what it would be like to be questioned as to the honor of your birth.
[time=3150] Jesus would know what it would be like to be hungry and homeless.
[time=3154] The foxes have holes, he said, and the birds have nests, but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head.
[time=3161] He was a man who was misunderstood, mistreated, and mistried.
[time=3170] He was beaten and flogged, humiliated and stripped, spit upon and abused, and he ultimately died.
[time=3178] He knows how we feel. He was tempted.
[time=3183] There is great debate amongst the theologians.
[time=3187] As to was Jesus tempted and able to sin, or was he tempted and really not able to sin?
[time=3195] If you're a student of Latin, there are those that say he was known, pulsae, picare, not able to sin.
[time=3203] Others would say no, he was pulsae, able, known, picare, able not to sin.
[time=3210] Here are the great scholars, of which I'm not.
[time=3213] Hodge representing the possibility that Jesus sin writes.
[time=3218] Temptation implies the possibility of sin.
[time=3222] If from the constitution of his person it was impossible for Christ to sin, then his temptation was unreal and without effect.
[time=3231] And he cannot sympathize with his people.
[time=3234] There is a reason and a logic to that argument.
[time=3237] I, however, disagree.
[time=3239] I believe that Jesus was able to be tempted, yet by the very character of his being, being God, he was not able to fall in the sin.
[time=3249] Does that mean he wasn't tempted then?
[time=3251] Listen to shed, a great theologian as well.
[time=3254] It is objected to a doctrine of Christ's impeccability that it is inconsistent with his temptability.
[time=3261] A person who cannot sin, it is said, cannot be tempted to sin.
[time=3266] This is not correct anymore than it would be correct to say that because an army cannot be conquered, it could not be attacked.
[time=3275] Temptability depends upon the constitutional susceptibility, while impeccability depends upon the will.
[time=3283] Those temptations were very real, they were very strong.
[time=3287] But if in the self-determination of his holy will, he was stronger than they, than they could not induce him to sin, and he would be impeccable.
[time=3297] I believe that Jesus Christ felt every blow of temptation that we will ever feel.
[time=3303] But because of his character of God and his will being more powerful than every temptation that Satan could throw upon him,
[time=3310] he was free from even the fear of falling into temptation.
[time=3315] But what was Jesus tempted with?
[time=3318] We read in Matthew 4 of the temptation of Christ, is that the only temptation he faced?
[time=3323] The Bible describes his temptations in two ways.
[time=3327] First, he was tempted in all points.
[time=3331] Was Jesus tempted as the last temptation of Christ would say, sexually?
[time=3337] I believe that he was, because he was tempted in all points.
[time=3341] Secondly, it says that he was tempted in all points like as we are.
[time=3345] It has been said that there are two types of people on earth.
[time=3349] Those who are sexually tempted and admit it, and those who lie and won't admit it.
[time=3355] Jesus was tempted.
[time=3357] But the error of that film is that they take the Lord Jesus Christ and do not show him as one who faced temptation and overcome it,
[time=3364] but they see him as a defeated man who fantasizes the most vulgar of sexual imaginations in his mind.
[time=3372] It brings us to the third statement about this Jesus to whom we can come for compassion.
[time=3381] Yes, he was sympathetic.
[time=3385] Yes, he was tempted, but he was without sin.
[time=3392] I bring to the pulpit today a newspaper article or rather a magazine,
[time=3398] and I don't read those often to you, but I felt that it was important today that as we talked about the last temptation of Christ,
[time=3405] you didn't simply hear the words of a conservative Baptist pastor, one who has not seen the film nor has any intention of seeing it, but you would hear from a neutral source, Time Magazine, what they have said about this film.
[time=3420] And I make three brief quotes.
[time=3422] Quote, Jesus is a reluctant leader subject to paranoid visions and uncertain as to whether he is hitting the call of God,
[time=3432] the call of Satan.
[time=3434] Mary Magdalene, a former girlfriend, tempts the Savior and haunts his fantasies.
[time=3440] Christ is shown as tormented and self-accusatory.
[time=3443] I lied.
[time=3444] I'm afraid Lucifer is inside of me.
[time=3449] Then there is a final dream sequence meant to be Christ hallucinating while on a cross, in which Jesus is shown briefly engaged in sexual relationships with Mary Magdalene.
[time=3460] That is not a conservative pastor in rural Indiana.
[time=3465] That is Time Magazine, July 25, 1988's review of the movie, The Last Temptation of Christ.
[time=3474] And the great air of the film is not to distinguish between one who would go face to face with temptation
[time=3480] and be impeccable.
[time=3482] They brought into him every vice known to man and made him guilty of each.
[time=3490] Someone argue, oh no, it's just a fantasy.
[time=3492] Didn't you know that sexual fantasy is sin?
[time=3496] And the impeccable Christ was not only above every temptation, it was above the fantasy of sin and temptation itself.
[time=3504] He is God and He is Lord.
[time=3526] We've been sharing with you today the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and orchestra, the handbells,
[time=3532] and our duet, teams, Keith, and Star Broadagum.

[time=3544] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3547] Dear Heavenly Father, we sincerely thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for our sins.
[time=3555] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3558] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3563] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3567] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3571] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
