[time=107] Satan is our real enemy, and he does not need to entangle us in the occult or to bombard us with demons in order to have victory.
[time=118] Satan must simply isolate the unbeliever apart from Christ and neutralize the believer from serving Christ.
[time=128] If he does that, he wins.
[time=131] [MUSIC]
[time=143] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=146] We're glad you could join us for the Morning Worship Service from our new sanctuary.
[time=151] Today's study is entitled "What the Bible Says About Satan." It will likely be shocking to many of us.
[time=158] Too often, we fail to realize that we are in the midst of a spiritual war, though unseen, it is real.
[time=165] Though spiritual, it is bought in this physical world.
[time=169] In this war, there are no neutral parties, no protected territories, no DMZ, and no lines of distinction.
[time=178] Most of us are unaware and unprepared.
[time=181] Are you ready?
[time=183] If not, today's study will be a great starting point.
[time=186] If you are, I am sure this study will further your commitment to Christ.
[time=192] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=196] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song with a selection entitled "Almighty God."
[time=202] [MUSIC]
[time=204] Other special music includes solos from Chris Bone,
[time=207] [MUSIC]
[time=209] Carrie Johnson,
[time=211] [MUSIC]
[time=212] and Joni King.
[time=214] [MUSIC]
[time=215] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=224] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=228] Now.
[time=230] [MUSIC - 4 seconds]
[time=236] All
[time=254] [MUSIC - 6 seconds]
[time=262] It is a joy on this Sunday morning
[time=268] with the beautiful sun shining in our hearts to come into this place and worship.
[time=274] It's only been pointed out to me oh a dozen or two dozen times today that we have had two services in this building out of three that it has reigned and they have said have and I have been praying.
[time=286] I have been praying.
[time=287] My yard needed the water you see.
[time=289] Would you pray?
[time=291] And we'll just make that your responsibility to pray for good weather.
[time=294] I want to thank you for coming.
[time=296] Worshiping with us on this rainy morning.
[time=299] Even though there is rain outside, there is the adversity of crossing the street.
[time=303] What an adventure it is to say I am committed to Jesus Christ and the priority of my life is to worship Him.
[time=310] This past week two of us spent three days in Jamaica.
[time=313] We discovered there that although there would be a hurricane that would rack the land, there would be a people that would say we are ambassadors for Christ.
[time=321] We will walk, we will worship, we will stop at nothing to declare His name.
[time=326] How much does it take to stop us today from our witness, from our walk, from our worship?
[time=332] I hope today there is an enthusiasm in your heart as we've come to this place to worship.
[time=337] We welcome you.
[time=338] We welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=342] We trust that God will use this hour as an hour of spiritual power as we endeavor to serve Jesus Christ.
[time=368] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=568] Oftentimes, within a piece, there's a particular phrase that sticks out, and in that song, "Almighty God," there's a phrase that says, "The Sustainer of my soul." What an encouragement our Lord is.
[time=580] Him number 25, please, we'll sing the first and third stanzas together of Him number 25.
[time=587] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=662] Speaking of the leaves, our leaves have changed from many of them being a gorgeous green, then in the fall to the glorious hues of the maple trees, and in some cases, no leaves at all.
[time=674] But we look forward to the spring of the year when God again renews.
[time=678] May He do that in our spiritual lives today.
[time=681] Let's continue with music now as Chris Bone comes to minister to us in song.
[time=686] [MUSIC - 122 seconds]
[time=813] (audience applauds) Again, it's our privilege to welcome you to the Bible Hour today, and we trust that you have already been encouraged spiritually by the music and our singing together.
[time=830] And speaking of music, we look forward to our friends, the gardeners, coming back.
[time=834] - Now, Rick, Steve, and Maria Gardner were members of our church for a number of years, and just a couple years ago, they moved to Fresno, California.
[time=841] But they're returning again to be with us on Sunday, November 6th.
[time=845] They'll be here in the morning and then give a premier concert of their new record at 6 p.m. that evening.
[time=851] - I'm looking forward to that.
[time=853] They've been friends of Pete and mine for a number of years, and we have had them in our church.
[time=858] We miss them living in California, and they're coming home for a choir.
[time=862] Not a choir, but an album premier will be just great.
[time=864] - Yes, they have a lot of friends in the area, and I hope that people become aware of the fact that they're back here in Fort Wayne, really, they're home.
[time=872] And this is a new album that I listened to this week, and it's very characteristic of Steve and Maria, and it'll be something that people will really enjoy.
[time=881] - I'm looking forward to that, and we want to invite you to join us both Sunday morning for our morning worship service with Steve and Maria Singing, and then for the evening where the whole concert is given over to them to premiere their new album.
[time=894] Today, we are speaking on the topic what the Bible says about Satan, and in light of that, we have a booklet to share with you called Contemporary Counterfeits.
[time=905] It's written by my friend John Davis, president of Grace Seminary, a great biblical insight as to what the Bible says about witchcraft, astrology, seances, calling back the dead.
[time=917] The power of demons are playing with things like the numbers.
[time=921] What does the Bible say?
[time=923] We have a booklet for you free if you'll simply write to us.
[time=926] - You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=937] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=945] - And as you write, we hope you'll request the booklet entitled Contemporary Counterfeits, and we'd love to hear from each of you.
[time=953] We have learned that a number of you friends have come to know Christ as Savior.
[time=957] Just a week or so ago, some people went out visiting for our church here in Fort Wayne.
[time=962] They met a lady, shared the Lord Jesus Christ with her, and she said, "Oh yes, I accepted Christ watching the Bible hour." What an encouragement that is to us, and we would greatly appreciate you writing, letting us know how God is using this television ministry in your life.
[time=978] Would you write to us today?
[time=980] I hope that you will.
[time=982] Many of you have received a letter from us telling you about our plans for the future, the new television equipment we have purchased, and the need for additional equipment.
[time=990] If you receive that letter, please act upon what God would have you to do.
[time=995] If you were feeling left out, you didn't receive a letter from us, please write and let us know that you would like to have that correspondence, and we'll be glad to send it to you.
[time=1004] So we do hope you'll write today for the booklet to let us know the spiritual impact of this ministry on your life and in response to our letter.
[time=1012] Once again, Pete, would you give our friends the address?
[time=1015] - Yes, it's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1024] - Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible hour.
[time=1029] [MUSIC - 249 seconds]
[time=1285] - Thank you, Kerry.
[time=1287] A song would give us the challenge to spend time with our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1293] Life is one of relationships.
[time=1296] The most vital is our relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1299] Sometimes in churches we miss opportunities to share that relationship from life to life.
[time=1305] It's my opportunity to share it from scripture to life.
[time=1309] But over the next few weeks I'm going to ask people from our church to share from their life what Jesus Christ would mean to them.
[time=1316] So I've asked a friend today, Officer Larry White is a sergeant in the Fort Wayne Police Department to share his faith in Jesus Christ with us as a family.
[time=1325] - It's a privilege to stand here this morning where the word of God is faithfully preached
[time=1338] to people who love and hunger for the truth.
[time=1342] And I'm thankful for Black Hawk and a pastor who's surrendered to the Lord,
[time=1348] spreads the aroma of Christ wherever he goes.
[time=1351] And Rick, I think I speak for all of the members here and those watching at home when I say we love you, and we love what Christ is doing in and through you.
[time=1362] For 15 years I have patrolled the streets of Fort Wayne as a police officer and can testify that Satan is alive and well, as Hal Lindsey would say.
[time=1373] The evidence of activity by the forces of darkness is plentiful.
[time=1378] How can we explain the multitudes of broken homes where fathers have rejected their responsibilities as leaders and examples?
[time=1387] And the resulting confusion and misdirection in our youth.
[time=1391] It's interesting to note that God in his word uses the relationship of father to children
[time=1397] as a picture of his relationship to us, his church, and how the role of father has repeatedly been attacked and distorted in recent years.
[time=1409] And then there's drug abuse and the increasing availability of drugs to our elementary age school children.
[time=1416] This is such a serious problem that the Fort Wayne Police Department has implemented a special educational program that targets those youngsters in an effort to inform them of the inherent evil of drug use.
[time=1429] And demonic fingerprints are all over the pornography industry.
[time=1434] Here's a multi-billion dollar business bent on the destruction of relationships by divorcing sex from love, commitment, and responsibility.
[time=1442] You can't separate them.
[time=1445] Many of our video rental stores here in Fort Wayne have x-rated sections where people can check out pornographic films.
[time=1453] But the spiritual battle didn't become a reality for me until 1975.
[time=1458] I grew up in the 50s and 60s with television heroes like Sky King,
[time=1465] Roy Rogers, Jack Webb, and yes, of course, Andy Griffith.
[time=1471] And I still watch Andy Griffith, by the way.
[time=1476] In 1975, God's Holy Spirit worked in my heart.
[time=1480] And I came to know Jesus Christ as Savior during a Billy Graham crusade.
[time=1484] It is Christ who is the real hero in my heart and life.
[time=1488] He is the master of the universe.
[time=1491] To know Jesus is to know God.
[time=1494] Am I now perfect because I'm a Christian?
[time=1497] No.
[time=1498] Just ask my wife, my son, or my fellow police officers, a couple of whom worshiped with us here.
[time=1506] I've fallen on my face many times.
[time=1510] But where there's repentance, there's forgiveness.
[time=1513] And I can get back up and press on toward the mark because Jesus is there.
[time=1518] And He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=1524] It's my heart's desire to be sold out to Christ, to love my wife like Christ loves you unconditionally, sacrificially, and unreservedly, and to live as an example for my son so that he may grow up to know Jesus and to love him because his daddy does and because that's been the atmosphere in our home.
[time=1549] Only through Christ does everything come into focus.
[time=1553] And it thrills my heart to know that Satan is a defeated foe and all of history is rushing to a point where every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God.
[time=1570] Thank you.
[time=1602] I thank you for your joy and your liberty.
[time=1834] That gives to our years an invitation to allow Jesus Christ to come into our lives.
[time=1840] Thank you for Larry.
[time=1842] It's clearness of commitment to Christ in his words this morning.
[time=1846] We pray that you would use these moments of ours together to speak to the hearts of men and women.
[time=1852] To touch us in the soul of our life.
[time=1856] To cause us to think deeper than our materialistic preoccupations.
[time=1860] To focus on the issues of the heart and of life.
[time=1863] We pray this morning that your hand would be upon us.
[time=1867] In Jesus' name.
[time=1869] [AMEN] It was a Sunday morning just like most other Sunday mornings.
[time=1877] Hawaii was warm yet cool.
[time=1880] That tropical weather never was that hot that it became uncomfortable.
[time=1885] Never so cool that it was undesirable.
[time=1887] It was just going to be another delightful Sunday morning.
[time=1892] Oh, across the oceans there was war.
[time=1895] World War II was raging, but on this Sunday morning America had protected themselves in a doctrine of isolationism.
[time=1903] America had said we can withdraw from the world conflict.
[time=1907] There may be a war out there, but it is not ours.
[time=1911] We are safe.
[time=1913] But it was not just another Sunday morning.
[time=1916] It was a Sunday morning that President Roosevelt would call a day that will live in infamy.
[time=1922] It was Sunday morning December the 7th, 1941.
[time=1927] Under the cover of darkness of night, 33 Japanese ships slipped within 200 miles of Pearl Harbor.
[time=1936] Just before 7 that morning they launched their aircraft.
[time=1941] When coming at about 7.55 a.m., the bombs were dropped out of the Japanese aircraft on Pearl Harbor.
[time=1950] And over 3,700 American lives were taken in a war that we thought we could ignore.
[time=1959] Many of us today are in the midst of an even greater war, and we too think that it is a war that we can ignore.
[time=1969] Larry, I'm thankful for not only the clarity of your testimony, but your insight that this is a time of spiritual conflict.
[time=1976] That Satan's hand is upon us, and there is a real spiritual battle, invisible to the eye undetected by the senses, yet real.
[time=1989] As real as a war with Japan, as consequential as a Sunday morning at Pearl Harbor, it is real.
[time=1997] If you have a Bible today, we will move from place to place, but allow me to focus your attention initially on Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10, 11 and 12.
[time=2011] Ephesians tells us about the believer in Christ, having the Lord Jesus, and blessed with great spiritual blessing.
[time=2020] But it also tells us of the intensity of spiritual conflict. Ephesians chapter 6, verse 10.
[time=2028] Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.
[time=2033] Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[time=2040] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against authorities, against powers of this dark world, and against spiritual forces of evil in heavenly realms.
[time=2059] This passage, like no other in Scripture, brings to our attention the reality of spiritual warfare.
[time=2067] Today we will move from passage to passage, not doing our typical expositional message of staying with a passage and digesting it thoroughly, but wanting to give you a panoramic view of this spiritual conflict we will move from place to place, for you and I are engaged in a war that we cannot ignore.
[time=2088] Here in this passage it talks about spiritual wickedness in high places.
[time=2094] The Bible teaches us that there is indeed a spiritual warfare, and as believers in Christ or even religious people searching for spiritual truth, we are engaged in a spiritual conflict with three distinct enemies.
[time=2114] Enemy number one is ourselves.
[time=2118] Galatians chapter 5 verse 17 says this, "The spirit warms against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit, the to our contrary, and you cannot do what you would.
[time=2133] You cannot on one day serve the spirit and within that moment say, but I also will serve my flesh myself.
[time=2142] There is an inner turmoil within the life of every person, a war with themselves."
[time=2149] That's why the Apostle Paul would lament and cry out, "Oh wretched men that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death?"
[time=2159] There is a war going on with yourself today and every day of your life.
[time=2165] There is a second enemy, society.
[time=2168] The Bible says the world is in the hands of Satan who is the prince and power of this world.
[time=2177] First John chapter 5 verse 19 says, "The whole world lies in the hand of the wicked one."
[time=2186] This world is dominated by satanic influences that crop up under such names as materialism, liberalism, humanism.
[time=2197] It is a society that seeks to please itself to the ignorance of God.
[time=2202] The third enemy that we have is none other than Satan himself.
[time=2207] First Peter chapter 5 verse 8 says that Satan is a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.
[time=2216] At this very moment Satan is taking inventory of this world of believers and seeking to know who it is that he can capture.
[time=2226] Who is it that he can destroy? Where is your Achilles heel that he might launch a deadly arrow?
[time=2233] He is a roaring lion. He is an adversary and is at war not only with God but with his people.
[time=2241] It could not have been more clearly defined in scripture than in the account of his attack on Job,
[time=2247] where Job presents himself before God and God sees him as a good moral believing man.
[time=2254] And Satan says, "Yes, but you let me have him and you'll see him fall."
[time=2260] Satan attacked Job. He brought about the death of his family.
[time=2264] He brought about the loss of his health and everything that he called a value because he is a roaring lion.
[time=2271] In a very summarily way, allow me to tell you three things that the scriptures tell us about Satan.
[time=2278] First of all, the scriptures tell us that Satan is real.
[time=2283] He is not just a negative force that there seems to be as the Easter's would say a dialectical dualism of the yin and the yang
[time=2293] or man of a key in dualism where there is an impersonal force of evil and an impersonal force of good.
[time=2299] And the two are just swirling aimlessly.
[time=2303] Oh no, the scriptures declare that he is real. That he is a spirit being that God created, holy good, holy beautiful.
[time=2314] Angelic in form, perhaps the prince of angels.
[time=2319] But the second thing the scriptures tell us is not only that he is real but that he is a rebel.
[time=2325] Ezekiel 28 speaks with such glowing poetic but accurate description of this one, Satan.
[time=2332] Ezekiel 28 is a rather involved piece of prophetic literature.
[time=2337] In Ezekiel 28 verse 1, the prophet Ezekiel speaks against the ruler of a city named Tyre.
[time=2345] And the ruler is identified in the King James Bible as the prince of Tyre.
[time=2351] And he is depicted very clearly as a human leader.
[time=2355] But when you come to verse 11, there is a change from the prince of Tyre to the king of Tyre.
[time=2361] It is rather poetic in picturesque.
[time=2365] But notice who this king of Tyre is. Ezekiel 28 verse 11.
[time=2371] The word of the Lord came unto me.
[time=2373] Son of man, take up a lamentation concerning the king of Tyre.
[time=2377] Say to him, this is what the sovereign Lord says.
[time=2381] You were the model of perfection.
[time=2384] Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, you were in Eden.
[time=2390] Every precious stone adorned at you.
[time=2395] Who was it that was in Eden?
[time=2399] Well, there are only four possibilities.
[time=2402] God himself, and I think we can dismiss that immediately, God is not bringing a lamentation against himself.
[time=2409] Secondly, it could be Adam.
[time=2411] However, Adam's dead.
[time=2413] Thirdly, it could be his wife, Eve, who was similarly gone.
[time=2418] The only possible interpretation of this one who was in Eden is Satan himself.
[time=2424] And in Eden, he was perfect in beauty as a created being until sin and deceit was found in him.
[time=2433] And he fell.
[time=2435] And he led a rebellion against God.
[time=2438] Allow me to pick up the reading in verse 14.
[time=2440] You were anointed as the guardian cherub for so I ordained you.
[time=2445] You were on the holy mound of God.
[time=2447] You walked among the fiery stones.
[time=2449] You were blameless in all your ways from the day you were created until wickedness was found in you.
[time=2459] Satan rebelled against God with his cry that he wanted to be God himself.
[time=2465] And he led a rebellion not only of his own being, but of every angel who would follow him
[time=2471] and hence the origin of evil angels, which we often call demons.
[time=2477] Finally, the Bible tells us along with the fact that he is real, that he is a rebel, that he is a roaring enemy.
[time=2487] That he is engaged in spiritual war for your life today.
[time=2494] Back in Ephesians chapter 6, we came to this phrase, "Put on the armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes."
[time=2507] Allow me to now focus on what the scripture reveals to us about satanic schemes.
[time=2515] This phrase also occurs in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 11 where it says,
[time=2521] "Paul is writing so that Satan might not outwit us, for we are not ignorant of his schemes."
[time=2530] Unfortunately, that is no longer true.
[time=2533] As a society, we are ignorant of Satan's schemes.
[time=2537] Most of us, when we think of Satan, we get an image of some absurdly evil group of people
[time=2545] who call themselves Satanists and who actually worship Satan.
[time=2551] Or we think of some bizarre situation where a person is controlled and influenced by demons.
[time=2559] That is certainly the crescendo of evil in spiritual warfare.
[time=2565] But Satan would love us to think that the spiritual battle is limited to Satan worshipers and demoniacs.
[time=2573] Oh no.
[time=2575] You see, Satan must only do two things.
[time=2580] He must isolate unbelievers from coming to no Christ and neutralize believers from coming to serve Christ.
[time=2588] If he does those two things, he wins.
[time=2592] If he can keep you isolated from Jesus Christ so that you never give your life to him as Savior,
[time=2598] he wins in your life.
[time=2601] And if you are a believer in Christ, the spiritual battle is not over.
[time=2605] For if he can neutralize you so that you do not serve Christ, he wins again.
[time=2611] Because he renders your life absolutely worthless in this spiritual warfare.
[time=2617] Why he may have lost you as a prize, he has not lost you as an enemy.
[time=2623] So all he must do is to isolate and neutralize.
[time=2629] I would like to suggest these are five of his most basic schemes of which we must not be ignorant.
[time=2637] Scheme number one is to eliminate the gospel from religion and philosophy.
[time=2645] If Satan can eliminate the gospel of Jesus Christ from religion and philosophy,
[time=2652] that is all he needs to do.
[time=2654] He doesn't need us to be out there sacrificing animals or even humans.
[time=2658] He doesn't need us engorging ourselves in the horrid occult.
[time=2663] He simply needs us to keep doing religious things, to keep doing church-like things,
[time=2669] to keep doing Christian-like things and not present the gospel of Christ, and he wins.
[time=2678] We often think of those diabolical, the contrary religions of atheism
[time=2684] or of universalism which teaches that God is just going to take everybody to have and don't worry about it.
[time=2692] But not only are there diabolically contrary religions, they're also deceitfully close religions.
[time=2701] For you see, there are many today who are meeting in churches.
[time=2705] Their churches are adorned with stained glass windows and crosses over their entrance
[time=2711] into their cornerstone, our etched verses of Scripture.
[time=2716] In their auditoriums, there are communion tables and open Bibles.
[time=2720] There are symbolic pieces of representation of religious truth everywhere,
[time=2726] but the message that is proclaimed is one that religion will save you, being a good person will save you, being kind to others will save you.
[time=2736] Well, there's value in all of those things, but there is not salvation in any of them.
[time=2742] For the Bible declares there is salvation in no other name except for the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2748] Larry, I'm thankful for a man who is not ashamed of the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2753] For his name alone can save you, and you can be sitting in a church on a Sunday morning,
[time=2759] you can hear familiar hymns, you can hear verses of Scripture that flow, but if there's not the declaration that you are a sinner, that I am a sinner, and that Jesus Christ is our only salvation, then Satan has his hand on that church
[time=2775] because he has successfully eliminated the gospel.
[time=2781] In Revelation chapter 2, Paul describes the Church of Smyrna as a place as Satan's synagogue.
[time=2791] He does the same thing in chapter 3 verse 9 of the Church of Sardis.
[time=2796] He says you are in the midst of Satan's synagogue that standing behind the religion of that day
[time=2803] was Satan himself, but if Satan wants to be the master plan,
[time=2811] he will not only try to eliminate it from our religion, but from our philosophy of life as well.
[time=2817] And you will see a lot of good things creeping into Christianity,
[time=2823] and we are not against those good things, but the danger is the good thing then in that ministry ellipses the great thing, the gospel of Christ.
[time=2832] And so many churches today have surrendered preaching the gospel, and they're now preaching some form of positive mental attitude.
[time=2842] Will a positive mental attitude help you?
[time=2845] It will help you in every way, except for salvation.
[time=2851] It will help you to be more successful in business, so learn to have a positive mental attitude.
[time=2857] It will help you in human relationships, so learn to have it.
[time=2861] Will it help you spiritually?
[time=2863] It may be the very curse of your spiritual life if you think having a good attitude pleases God so much that he accepts you
[time=2872] simply because you have a good attitude.
[time=2875] Tragically, many of us have taught positive mental attitudes so that now we have made people much more happy on their way to hell.
[time=2885] I was traveling with a doctor friend this past week and I was fighting a cold off and he had given me some medication and he said, "You don't look too good." And I said, "I feel great." He said, "I'm going to tell you one more time.
[time=2897] I am the doctor.
[time=2898] I'll tell you when you're feeling good." And there's a lot of people standing behind pulpits today or behind seminar lecterns.
[time=2907] They're saying, "I am the expert.
[time=2909] I'll tell you whether you're doing good or not." And whether you're doing good or not is of no issue if you have not received Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and Satan wins in strategy number one if he can simply eliminate the gospel from religion and philosophy.
[time=2929] Scheme number two, entangle us in the cares of this world.
[time=2936] In Matthew chapter 13 it is recorded one of Christ's greatest parables.
[time=2940] He tells about a sower who goes out and he scatters seed.
[time=2944] The seed falls on the roadside and the birds come and pick it and nothing grows.
[time=2950] Other falls amongst stones and it grows but because there's rock there it can't get rooted and it withers and dies.
[time=2957] A third handful of seed falls in good soil but it's full of weeds and the weeds choke out the good seed.
[time=2965] And finally it falls on good soil and it grows and it multiplies.
[time=2970] Jesus then explained the parable and I'll only bring one hub of his interpretations to you.
[time=2975] Jesus said the seed that fell amongst the good soil but was then choked out by the forms and the weeds represents the word of God that is sown but is choked out by, and these are the Lord's words, the cares of this world.
[time=2994] All then Satan has to do in strategy number two is keep us so busy, so active, so involved with this good life
[time=3004] that God has given us that we ignore the spiritual conflict and hence we are lost in the battle.
[time=3013] Our jobs, our families, in our culture, our recreation can become such a preoccupation that we are busy from long before sun up to long after sundown and our constant statement is I need to address the spiritual dimension of my life but I am too busy.
[time=3036] We spent two days in Jamaica doing some follow-up work this past week.
[time=3040] We visited a lady who lived in the most remote part of the world that I can imagine.
[time=3046] She had a nice home, she had no car, she had no television, she had no radio, she had no job.
[time=3053] She had enough money to live on in this nice home.
[time=3056] We had invited her to church, she said she had been in that home for four months but she had been too busy to make it to church.
[time=3063] She hadn't done anything for four months but she was too busy.
[time=3068] Cares of this world are strategy number two.
[time=3071] Strategy number three is to entangle us in negative emotions.
[time=3079] If Satan can get us bound up by negative emotions like bitterness and anger, pride, resentment, he can neutralize our spiritual power.
[time=3092] In 2 Corinthians chapter two, he writes to the Church of Corinth and pleads with them to forgive a fallen brother so that their own hearts would learn to forgive and they would be free from bitterness.
[time=3105] The last Satan have his root in them and he saw that bitterness was "a scheme of the devil." In 1 Timothy chapter three, verse six it says, "To be careful when you promote somebody in a position of spiritual leadership lest they be lifted up with pride, the fall of the devil.
[time=3128] Pride is a negative emotion." In Matthew chapter 16, verse 23, Jesus said that his plan of God was to suffer on the cross and die for our sins.
[time=3139] And Peter said, "I won't let it happen." And Jesus said, "Get thee behind me, Satan." You see, "Stryful spirits come from Satan."
[time=3153] Negative emotions like self-domination come from Satan.
[time=3159] If he has not been successful in your life by eliminating the gospel or entangling you with the cares of this world, one of his other schemes is to entangle you in negative emotions.
[time=3171] To get you so upset about an injustice that you become bitter and bounding your bitterness or to lift you up with so much pride that you walk around with an air of superiority that neutralizes you from serving Christ or to tie you up because of your inner conflicts
[time=3193] with other people that you have been unsuccessful in resolving.
[time=3199] In Luke chapter 22, two disciples come to Jesus behind the hem of their mother's skirt.
[time=3207] She speaks for the boys and says, "Lord, could it be that this son and this son couldn't one sit on your right hand and one sit on their left hand when you enter your kingdom?" While those two disciples were there with their mother, guess what the other ten were doing?
[time=3225] They're over here saying, "Can you believe those guys?
[time=3227] Who do they think they are?" I mean, I started serving Christ before they started serving Christ and you're a better speaker than it.
[time=3232] What do you think they're doing?
[time=3235] Selfish strife began to build up in them and then Peter appears and you know what the Lord says to Peter?
[time=3241] And similarly on he says, "Peter, Satan has desired you that he could sift you as weak, that he could just shake you down to any bitty little particles."
[time=3255] Selfish strife, vain glory, negative emotions become a prison that he can use.
[time=3262] His fourth strategy may be his most effective in our society to entangle us in the cares of this world, to entangle us in negative emotions, and then to enslave us to sin.
[time=3278] Sin has a very simple three-step plan.
[time=3284] Lust, sin, death.
[time=3287] Lust, the attraction of the eye.
[time=3290] Oh, I covered that vehicle.
[time=3293] Oh, I must have that new outfit.
[time=3296] The lust of the eye.
[time=3298] Oh, now there's a body that I should conquer.
[time=3302] The pride of life.
[time=3304] I should be elevated.
[time=3306] It begins within the focus of the mind's imagination.
[time=3310] The Bible calls it lust.
[time=3312] And then lust when it is conceived brings forth sin.
[time=3316] The actual outworking of evil.
[time=3320] And then finally sin produces death.
[time=3323] But can I give you another little three points to how sin enslaves us?
[time=3328] First of all, it attracts us.
[time=3330] We see that which is attractive and we move towards it, and sin is always presented as attractive.
[time=3337] Then we find it not only attractive, but we find it somehow acceptable.
[time=3342] We justify it.
[time=3343] We minimize it.
[time=3344] We excuse it.
[time=3345] We condone it.
[time=3347] We make it acceptable.
[time=3349] And after that which is attractive becomes acceptable.
[time=3352] Then it becomes an addiction.
[time=3356] You heard the words of Robert Palmer's song of 1986.
[time=3360] Well, you might as well face it.
[time=3362] You're addicted to love.
[time=3364] I mean, the rock musician can tell you that.
[time=3368] That sexuality is such which is attractive.
[time=3372] Our society makes it acceptable.
[time=3374] And now we as a generation are addicted to love.
[time=3379] Better phrase, addicted to sex.
[time=3383] Satan would love to untangle us in materialism and sexuality and self-gratification in every form so that he can neutralize us.
[time=3394] His fifth and final scheme is to enlist you in his service.
[time=3399] Yes, Satanism and the all called is real.
[time=3403] Many today do not understand why there was so much demonic activity in the Bible and yet we don't seem to see it today.
[time=3411] May I explain it to you in this way?
[time=3414] I believe that there is satanic demonic activity working in lives here today.
[time=3420] But the reason is not as blatant or apparent as it was in the gospel of Jesus Christ is that was the battle of battles.
[time=3428] You see, Satan had one chance and only one in all of history to defeat Christ.
[time=3434] If he could cause Christ to sin, if he could keep Christ from the cross, then Satan ultimately wins.
[time=3441] And if Christ makes it to the cross, Satan ultimately dies.
[time=3446] And so every demon, every evil angel, every power in Satan's realm
[time=3453] was thrown at Jesus Christ and there was a fury of demonic activity at one point wherever Christ was because that was the battle of the centuries.
[time=3464] And it may well be our blessing that we don't see as much demonic activity today in this community because there are so many believers in Christ.
[time=3472] And the presence of Jesus' name and the presence of His Spirit are our power.
[time=3478] And the devil and his demons do flee at the name of Jesus.
[time=3484] And you and I have finally our own spiritual strategies.
[time=3490] There are only two things that we have.
[time=3492] We have the word and we have prayer, and nothing else can deliver us.
[time=3498] Back in Ephesians.
[time=3515] We've been sharing with you the ministry of the Bible hour with music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Chris Bone, Kerry Johnson and Joni King.
[time=3525] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3528] You've made a decision today concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3532] I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.

[time=3538] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this opportunity to come to you and to tell you that I'm a sinner and I need Jesus Christ as my Savior.
[time=3548] I ask you to come into my heart today and to cleanse me of my sins.
[time=3553] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3557] We've made a decision to trust Christ this week.
