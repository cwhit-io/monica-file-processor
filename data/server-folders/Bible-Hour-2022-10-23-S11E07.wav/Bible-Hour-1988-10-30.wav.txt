[time=113] A sheriff confiscated and impounded a slot machine.
[time=118] To justify his actions, he cited a law under the hunting and fishing code.
[time=124] The law stated that it was illegal to use a steel device to trap a dumb animal.
[time=131] (music playing)
[time=143] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. We're glad you could join us for this morning worship service from our new sanctuary.
[time=151] Today's study is entitled "What the Bible Says About Gambling and the Lottery." I'm sure you can tell from mixed introduction a moment ago that he is prepared to teach why we should not gamble.
[time=162] You can be sure that today's study will be both biblical and practical.
[time=166] But you may be surprised to learn that there is another type of gambler, one that God wants us to be.
[time=172] Are there any risk-takers listening today? I bet there are.
[time=177] We encourage you to locate your Bible and study along with us.
[time=180] On today's program, the sanctuary choir will be singing the hymn "Holy Ground."
[time=186] Other special music includes solos from Dennis Kirschner and Teresa Rust.
[time=195] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=203] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=209] Now here's Rick to this worship service.
[time=212] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=218] And as we meet today, we meet in the presence of our God.
[time=221] That makes this place holy, not because it's a sanctuary, not because of its beauty,
[time=227] because God meets with us. We are standing in His presence on Holy Ground.
[time=257] And I knew this was the place we're loved for this is a temple.
[time=272] We are standing in His presence on Holy Ground.
[time=290] We are standing on Holy Ground.
[time=301] And I know that there are angels all around.
[time=313] Oh, let us praise Jesus now.
[time=322] We are standing in His presence on Holy Ground.
[time=332] In His presence, there's joy beyond measure.
[time=344] And at His free peace of mind, He's still defined.
[time=356] If you have the need, I know He has the answer.
[time=367] Just reach out and claim it, child.
[time=372] You're standing on Holy Ground.
[time=390] And I know that there are angels all around.
[time=400] Let us praise Jesus now.
[time=410] We are standing in His presence on Holy Ground.
[time=420] We are standing on Holy Ground.
[time=431] And I know that there are angels all around.
[time=441] Let us praise Jesus now.
[time=451] We are standing in His presence.
[time=461] We are standing in His presence on Holy Ground.
[time=482] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=485] Let us continue on that theme as we sing together Him number 266.
[time=490] Verses 1, 2, and 3 of 266.
[time=505] We are standing on Holy Ground.
[time=518] And we let our hearts be for you.
[time=522] Verses 1, 2, and 3 of 6.
[time=548] We are standing on Holy Ground.
[time=563] Verses 1, 2, and 3 of 6.
[time=592] With our new hymnals, we have the privilege of reviewing for some of you songs that you've sung without the hymnal.
[time=599] And for some of you, these are brand new.
[time=601] We are glad that you will follow along and take your hymnals and sing with us these great songs that are introduced in this new hymnal.
[time=608] We continue with music now as Dennis Kirschner comes to minister his song.
[time=612] Let's listen as he sings for us.
[time=617] I would like to sing a song that may be familiar to you, but it may not.
[time=622] And if you'd like to follow along, you'll find it in our hymnals in Him number 465.
[time=627] I'm going to sing it through one time, and then I'd like to ask you to join me as we sing it through the second time.
[time=633] The song is taken from the Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 11, where it tells us that no matter what troubles we have in our life, what happens to us from day to day.
[time=643] That God will see to it that His Word and what He has for us will be taken care of in His time.
[time=662] In His time, in His time, He makes all things beautiful in His time.
[time=685] Lord, please show me every day as you're teaching me your way.
[time=697] That you do just what you say in your time.
[time=707] In your time, in your time.
[time=719] You may call things beautiful in your time.
[time=731] Lord, my life to you, I pray.
[time=743] May each song I have to sing to you, a lovely thing in your time.
[time=751] Would you join me now, please?
[time=759] In His time, in His time.
[time=765] He makes all things beautiful in His time.
[time=776] Lord, please show me every day as you're teaching me your way.
[time=788] That you do just what you say in your time.
[time=799] In your time, in your time.
[time=810] You may call things beautiful in your time.
[time=821] Lord, my life to you, I pray.
[time=827] May each song I have to sing to you, a lovely thing in your time.
[time=844] Be to you a lovely thing in your time.
[time=869] It's our privilege to welcome you once again to the Bible Hour.
[time=873] It's certainly a delight to be in our new home, isn't it?
[time=875] We've had a very enjoyable three weeks now in our new worship center, and yes, you're right, Rick.
[time=881] It's a great place to worship God.
[time=883] We are privileged to have it, and we're looking forward to using it for God's glory.
[time=887] And we're looking forward to our friends, Steve Maria Gardner, being with us.
[time=891] And if you're watching television today in Fort Wayne, Indiana, you could hurry up, get dressed, and join us here at 9.45
[time=899] for our morning worship service with Steve and Maria Gardner, or at six o'clock tonight.
[time=904] Rick, I've been in California for several years, having been a part of our church for a long time.
[time=909] I moved there, I believe, about two and a half years ago, and we're looking forward to a homecoming this evening
[time=915] as they give a new premier concert of their latest record.
[time=919] I'm looking forward to that.
[time=920] We had the privilege of having them do a premiere of a record once before, and we're looking forward to that tonight.
[time=926] That will be great.
[time=927] That will be at 6 p.m. here in our worship center, and if you haven't been with us, those of you in Fort Wayne,
[time=933] you haven't seen the center, and you know Steve and Maria come and join us tonight at 6 p.m.
[time=937] And just to clarify, the date is November the 6th at 9.45 morning worship service and 6 o'clock in the evening for the full concert.
[time=946] We have a booklet that we want to share with you today.
[time=949] It's a booklet that talks about two topics that we've been studying.
[time=953] Last week we looked at what the Bible says about Satan.
[time=957] And this morning we're going to look at what the Bible says about gambling.
[time=961] One of the forms of gambling that is very popular is called "Playing the Numbers." And there's a chapter in this book by John Davis on numerology.
[time=970] People who find that in numbers there's a mystery, there's a science, even there's a power.
[time=976] And we want you to be well aware of Satan's schemes and his devices, and this booklet will help you to understand how he works not only in numerology,
[time=984] but in astrology, in sooth saying, in calling back the dead.
[time=989] What is Satan up to?
[time=991] This booklet will help you, and we'd love to send you a copy today.
[time=995] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1005] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1014] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1015] A moment ago we were talking about how tremendous it is to be in our new worship center here.
[time=1021] 2,000 seats in room for a 150 voice choir and an orchestra platform, and they have done a marvelous job in leading us in worship.
[time=1030] We're also privileged that we've been able to purchase a lot of new television equipment.
[time=1035] What we're looking into right now is a brand new television camera.
[time=1039] That's been made possible by gifts from friends like you.
[time=1043] But we've only been able to purchase about half of the television equipment that we need.
[time=1048] And for that reason, we wrote a letter to many of you over the past few weeks.
[time=1052] I hope that you received a copy of our letter.
[time=1055] And if you did, we would like to ask you to prayerfully consider what it is that God would want you to do to help our ministry financially.
[time=1064] Those of you who watch this television show regularly know that we almost never, and I have to say almost never mention finances,
[time=1072] and we're not going to labor at the point today, but we simply want to ask friends who are blessed by this ministry,
[time=1078] who are able to do so, to help us with the purchase of some needed new equipment.
[time=1082] If you didn't receive a letter, please don't feel left out.
[time=1085] Just send us your name and address.
[time=1087] We'll send you the booklet that Pete offered a moment ago, and we'll be glad to include you and all of our correspondence if you would like that.
[time=1095] So once again, our address is please, Pete.
[time=1098] The address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1107] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1137] Thank you, Pete, and I will be glad to hear you.
[time=1144] We'll be glad to hear you.
[time=1150] Thank you, Pete, and I will be glad to hear you.
[time=1316] Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1321] Thank you, Dale, and thank you for taking the time to memorize God's Word.
[time=1326] In the football game of life, we have to know the plays.
[time=1330] The enemy, the defense, Satan will swarm upon us like a free safety and nail us for a loss every time.
[time=1338] But if you know the plays, you'll be able to be effective in running for Christ.
[time=1343] To memorize God's Word, it is the playbook of life.
[time=1348] Our God and our Father, we thank you today that you cared enough about us to give us your Word.
[time=1355] I'm thankful today, God, that through your Word we can know you.
[time=1363] And even this morning as we would study the issues of life, God, we would want direction that comes from you.
[time=1370] We would want insight that is greater than any human perspective.
[time=1375] And so, God, even as Teresa would sing, we would ask for the assistance of your Spirit today.
[time=1381] We ask that your Spirit would fall upon us in a fresh way.
[time=1385] I would ask you to rejuvenate our minds, to create in us a hunger to know you and to know your Word.
[time=1393] We pray that your Spirit would come upon us and refresh us, to give us an urgency to share Christ with people.
[time=1401] Oh, God, I have been blessed even in these moments this morning, and I ask you to continue to work in our midst.
[time=1409] We pray that your Spirit would give to us a unity of the body with a bond of peace, that we would be knit together as one.
[time=1418] We pray that we would have a burden for outreach.
[time=1421] And so, we would pray today for our lives, that there would be that outreach of integrity.
[time=1428] Out of a purity of walk, we would witness.
[time=1431] We pray for our words that our conversation would always be full of grace seasoned with salt.
[time=1440] We pray this morning for those who are serving in difficult places, Bangladesh, Jamaica, and the Philippines with the natural disasters
[time=1451] that have come.
[time=1453] God, we would ask you to give extra strength to those missionaries and believers that they might turn this time of physical tragedy into one of spiritual triumph.
[time=1464] We pray today for your comfort, for Ken Pettit in the loss of his mother,
[time=1470] for Dan Sheebull and Sarah Rogers in the loss of their mother.
[time=1477] We pray today for strength for Becky Kluff as she fights back against meningitis.
[time=1484] We pray for Barb Padilla that the surgery on her back would not be necessary come tomorrow.
[time=1490] We would pray for Judy's mother that you would give her courage and strength as she fights back from a stroke.
[time=1497] We'd pray this morning for single parents who have life's toughest assignment that you would give to them the energy and the strength.
[time=1507] We pray today for those who have allowed themselves to make wrong choices and now their slaves to their habit.
[time=1517] May we find today liberty, a freeing power. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1529] In 1976, Erica Earlehart's lucky number came up.
[time=1536] The big winner in the New York Lottery, the winnings were $1 million.
[time=1545] To be paid out in $50,000 installments a year for 20 years.
[time=1553] That's big money.
[time=1555] But that's not as big of money as what could have been earned yesterday in the California Lottery.
[time=1562] As of this morning's news, they don't know whether a lottery winner has been found.
[time=1567] But the California Lottery would pay off between $60 and $61 million.
[time=1574] If there is a winner, that winner will receive annual checks of $2,400,000.
[time=1585] For Erica Earlehart, the lucky number came up.
[time=1589] A million prize was given to her.
[time=1594] Please know the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say.
[time=1599] As the winning of the $1 million lottery, Erica Earlehart has gone through two
[time=1606] divorces and two custody disputes over the children.
[time=1612] She is paying alimony and she is borrowing money living on debt.
[time=1620] She makes a regular trip to the bank to borrow against the next lottery check
[time=1627] on the next installment.
[time=1629] Her lucky number came up.
[time=1632] Almost in a sense of poetic irony, please note that the lucky winner's
[time=1638] name was Earnhardt.
[time=1642] What does the Bible say about gambling and the lottery?
[time=1648] Well, I have to confess to you there's not one place in the Bible where the word "gambling" occurs.
[time=1654] If you went through a concordance and you looked for the word "gambler", "gambling", you would not find it.
[time=1661] Neither would you find the word "bet" as to place a wager.
[time=1666] The word will not occur.
[time=1668] Nor will you find the word "lottery" in Scripture.
[time=1671] You will find the root to the word "lottery", however, it's the word "lot".
[time=1677] In the Bible, the word "lot" occurs time and time again, both in the old and in the New Testament, they use the systems of casting lots to determine the selection of an individual.
[time=1691] Let me give you several illustrations.
[time=1693] In the book of Numbers, God told them when you move into the promised land and you drive out all of your enemies and it comes time to divide up the land,
[time=1704] he anticipated that the tribe of Ephraim might say to the tribe of Gad, "You got a better deal than we got, that's not fair." Or the tribe of Manasseh might look at the tribe of Benjamin and say, "Why did you get the prime real estate?" And so God instructed them that they were to draw straws, cast lots
[time=1725] to determine which of the 12 tribes of Israel got which parcel of land
[time=1731] when they came to the promised land.
[time=1734] Also, the Bible says that when Jonah fled from God, he got on the ship,
[time=1740] headed to the opposite corner of the world, a storm blew up.
[time=1745] The men of that ship were somehow aware of the fact that this storm was divine vengeance upon a sinner on that vessel.
[time=1754] And so to determine who it was, they drew lots, and Jonah was the lucky winner.
[time=1763] In the New Testament, the system of lot drawing was also used.
[time=1768] Judas is dead, he has betrayed Christ, he has executed himself.
[time=1773] Now the 12 are 11.
[time=1778] They need to replace it so that there are 12.
[time=1782] And so they set forth the qualifications and they come to the point where there are two equally qualified people and so they cast lots, draw straws, to determine who would be the replacement for Judas.
[time=1800] The Bible did use the casting of lots, the drawing of straws.
[time=1805] Please don't misunderstand it.
[time=1807] Every time the lot was cast or a straw was drawn, it was to solve an otherwise unsolvable problem in what appeared to be an equitable way.
[time=1820] What do you say to 12 tribes?
[time=1822] There's this mountainous land and there's this great valley pasture land.
[time=1826] How do you decide who gets what?
[time=1828] What was an equitable way of solving the problem?
[time=1831] In terms of gambling, there's no relationship.
[time=1835] In terms of a lottery, there's nothing there in to be compared.
[time=1841] Well that's gambling and lottery in the Bible.
[time=1846] What about in American history?
[time=1849] Well it may be sad to those of us who oppose gambling to discover that American history is part of the expression rich with gambling and lottery traditions.
[time=1860] Of our 13 original colonies, we tend to focus our attention on those colonies like Massachusetts where Godly men wanting to worship God came to establish a godly empire.
[time=1872] Do you know how Georgia was colonized?
[time=1874] Nobody wanted to go to Georgia.
[time=1877] And so they went to the prisons of England and said, "Who would like to get released from prison if you want out, you've got to go to Georgia." Virginia was running low on funds.
[time=1890] And so the King of England made a plan for the funding of the colony of Virginia by a nationwide run lottery out of London.
[time=1901] It funded the founding of Virginia Colony.
[time=1904] In the early days of US history, one as eminent as Benjamin Franklin ran a lottery out of his home.
[time=1912] If you have been a student of US history or just a watcher of Old Westerns, you'll know that the West was pioneered by settlers,
[time=1923] fur hunters, gold diggers, and a gambler who was willing to relieve all of them of their goods.
[time=1931] Kenny Rogers put his finger on American tradition when he said, "You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run." It's part of our American tradition.
[time=1944] But you should also know this lesson out of US history.
[time=1947] During the 1820s and 30s, there began to be a revival in America,
[time=1953] a undercurrent of revival that started in quiet places like state New York and the woodlands of Indiana.
[time=1962] It was a movement that had no name, but now in history we call that movement the second great awakening.
[time=1969] And out of that spiritual foundation of awakening in American history, there came the birth of a reform movement.
[time=1977] Out of that reform movement came abolitionists, those who were out to abolish slavery.
[time=1983] Out of that reform movement came Susan B. Anthony, woman suffrage advocate.
[time=1989] Out of that reform movement came a movement to make laws, to prohibit abuses within our penitentiary system, and prison reform was born.
[time=2001] Out of that spiritual movement came the first of temperance movements in America, the attempt to rid our society of the availability of alcohol.
[time=2011] Out of that movement came reforms in child labor law, and out of that movement came the prohibition of state run lotteries, and the illegalization of gambling east of the Mississippi River.
[time=2028] It was decided that if you were going west of the Mississippi River, you had to be a gambler and you should not be robbed of your rightful disposition.
[time=2038] But that's American history.
[time=2040] If the Bible doesn't speak about gambling, why don't we find our church with a little numbers game out of the lobby or a little lottery inside your bulletin?
[time=2051] Do you ever think of that?
[time=2052] I mean if we just sold one dollar tickets to 1800 people here today, and if just each of you would buy tickets, we could fund missions to help rescue work after the Hurricane Ruby swept through Lady in the Philippines.
[time=2068] Why don't we do that?
[time=2072] Well if the Bible doesn't talk about gambling our betting, isn't it safe for us to bet that it's okay?
[time=2078] Although the words don't occur, there are some significant spiritual principles that are an absolute distinct counter-diction to the concept of gambling and even the lottery.
[time=2092] Allow me to bring three conflicts to your attention.
[time=2095] The first conflict is contentment versus greed.
[time=2101] If you have a Bible, I invite you to open it to Ecclesiastes, chapter 5 and verse 10.
[time=2109] Ecclesiastes is located in the middle of your Bible.
[time=2112] If you can find Psalms, it goes Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes.
[time=2120] Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 10 reads like this.
[time=2127] Whoever loves money never has enough.
[time=2133] Whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income.
[time=2141] This too is meaningless.
[time=2148] It's worth noting that the writer of those words is the famous Solomon, Solomon who was the wealthiest man of his day
[time=2160] and still may have been the wealthiest man of all of history.
[time=2165] He was a man who had such gold and silver and splendor that it became famous worldwide and dignitaries and nobility from far away countries traveled just to see if it was true.
[time=2180] And the report was this.
[time=2182] It's not only true, but the half of it has not been told.
[time=2189] So we have this insight from the wealthiest man of his day, that whoever loves money, whoever craves wealth, will never be satisfied.
[time=2202] You see, there is, as we talked last week, a spiritual war.
[time=2207] And one of the battlefields is within the heart of each one of us.
[time=2212] And there is the battle for the virtue of contentment competing against the vice of greed.
[time=2221] And repeatedly in the scriptures, it warns us that if what you don't have today isn't satisfying you,
[time=2231] getting it tomorrow won't either.
[time=2236] Proverbs chapter 27, verse 20, add this insight.
[time=2242] Death and destruction are never satisfied and neither are the
[time=2249] eyes of a man.
[time=2253] Once we allow our appetites to dictate our ethics,
[time=2259] we will never find satisfaction.
[time=2262] Let me repeat that for you again.
[time=2264] Once we allow our appetites to dictate our ethics, we will never find satisfaction.
[time=2274] There will be a constant battle between virtue and vice between
[time=2280] contentment and greed.
[time=2283] Proverbs gives to us great insight about the need for contentment.
[time=2288] In Proverbs chapter 28 and verse 25, it gives us this insight.
[time=2294] A greedy man stirs up dissension, but he who trusts in the Lord
[time=2301] will prosper.
[time=2304] Most of the time the death of a loved one is an occasion for
[time=2310] great mourning.
[time=2312] And thus that loved one is not too close to us, and that loved one happens to be significantly wealthy.
[time=2321] Then their death would be sort of lamented.
[time=2326] Such a case took place in Lutheran Hospital, Fort Wayne, Indiana, an elderly lady who had no living
[time=2335] relatives in her immediate family.
[time=2338] Only some distant relatives was dying.
[time=2343] Her will was rather clear, these distant relatives were going to inherit an enormous amount of money.
[time=2349] And so of course in her dying days they were careful to pay good attention to her.
[time=2354] And they would come to the hospital and visit her, and her condition deteriorated again and again and again.
[time=2361] She entered into a coma from which the doctors assured the family she would never recover.
[time=2367] The coma lasted beyond days into weeks, and the family then began to get greedy for the game that was around the corner.
[time=2376] But the greed soon stirred up contention.
[time=2381] And one said, "Well, I don't think it's right.
[time=2383] You're getting what you're getting and I'm only getting what I'm getting." And they began to argue back and forth right around the dying woman's hospital bed when guests who came out of the coma.
[time=2399] It can stir up strife to the point where it might even arouse the dead.
[time=2409] Another proverb worth our noting is Proverbs 14 and verse 30.
[time=2415] It says, "A heart at peace gives life to the body,
[time=2421] but envy rots the bones."
[time=2427] Of course, it would be unwise and inaccurate to say that every physical problem can be traced back to a spiritual or emotional problem.
[time=2438] That would be untrue.
[time=2440] But it would also be untrue to say there's no relationship between physical problems and emotional and spiritual problems.
[time=2448] Dr. Jack Clark of our church taught a seminar that I attended and he talked about the effect of stress in the life of rats.
[time=2459] You say, "Well, I'm not a rat.
[time=2461] We'll vote on that one after the service." Here's how the experiment went.
[time=2466] A group of rats were taken and they were injected with carcinogenic cells, cells that were cancerous.
[time=2474] After the injections, tests were taken at a specified time, and about 37% of the rats developed cancer.
[time=2484] Then another group of rats were taken.
[time=2487] These rats were put into a very stressful environment.
[time=2491] They were put into an environment where the floor on which they lived had a metal mesh to it.
[time=2497] And randomly, with no logic, no occasion for them to be able to discern when or why a jolt of curt was put through the floor that rats would get a charge.
[time=2509] Once the rats were significantly stressed, those rats were injected with the same carcinogenic cells.
[time=2518] And after the same period of time elapsed, the study concluded that over 70% of them developed cancer.
[time=2526] The point of that illustration is this.
[time=2529] Our physical life can be greatly impaired by our emotional
[time=2535] and our spiritual problems.
[time=2538] That's what Solomon told us 3,000 years ago that envy rots our bones.
[time=2546] He wasn't just speaking politically.
[time=2548] He was saying the lack of contentment in our life can damage our health.
[time=2555] What you can do by becoming a gambler and a player of the lottery is stir up your greed.
[time=2563] Stir up your jealousy.
[time=2565] Stir up your envy against what other people have.
[time=2568] Create a new and insatiable appetite for more.
[time=2571] And that envy may be the cause of your physical suffering, along with your emotional and spiritual.
[time=2581] The players in the game know well that it only exists
[time=2588] if greed and avarice can be stimulated.
[time=2594] TV commercials, both in our state and others, bring to the attention of the viewer how glamorous the lottery is, how glamorous it would be to gamble, how exciting it all is.
[time=2608] Notice some of these advertising lines.
[time=2611] One TV commercial says Las Vegas.
[time=2614] It's the American way to play.
[time=2617] In front of you is nothing but action and excitement and adventure and an explander.
[time=2623] Do you want to know why casinos are so beautiful and so attractive?
[time=2629] It is because the average take in a casino
[time=2635] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, per day, not per year, per day approaches $500,000 a day.
[time=2646] If you're willing to give me $500,000 a day, you won't believe what this place will look like.
[time=2655] Sure it looks beautiful.
[time=2657] It's got to look attractive.
[time=2659] It's a baited hook and the losers are the gamblers
[time=2665] and the winners are the operators and it will never change.
[time=2671] The lottery in Illinois advertises this phrase.
[time=2675] You talk about truth in advertising.
[time=2678] "Everyone is a winner." Now the odds of you winning the lottery in the state of Illinois are one in four million.
[time=2690] But the advertisement says everybody is a winner.
[time=2694] An advertisement in New York says hit it once and all of your troubles are over.
[time=2702] I think equal time ought to be given to Erica Earnhardt, the how how instantly her troubles ended the day she hit it once.
[time=2712] You see the whole industry of gambling and the lottery exists only if it can continue to stimulate greed and envy and jealousy in the life of people.
[time=2724] There was an editorial in our paper.
[time=2726] Somebody was kind enough to give it to me and I don't mean to ridicule this person, you mean to disagree.
[time=2732] This person argues the lottery would make believers out of betters.
[time=2737] The point that they make is this.
[time=2739] If Hoosiers are permitted to play the lottery, it will increase prayer.
[time=2744] I have friends in Ohio who regularly buy lottery tickets and pray, "Dear Lord, let me win."
[time=2755] I don't argue the point that if we had a lottery, we would all see more prayers coming up from the great Hoosiers state.
[time=2764] The quality of those prayers I'm a bit suspicious of.
[time=2769] You see, the whole industry lives and dies on how greedy are we.
[time=2775] How envious are we of what the other person has.
[time=2781] There's a second conflict though.
[time=2783] The first conflict is contentment versus greed.
[time=2791] The second conflict is the battle between work and fantasy.
[time=2799] Look at this passage in Proverbs, please.
[time=2802] Proverbs 28, 19, and 20.
[time=2807] It reads like this.
[time=2815] "He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
[time=2827] A faithful man will be richly blessed, but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished."
[time=2836] In this spiritual battle between work and fantasy,
[time=2844] allow me to draw three thoughts to your attention.
[time=2846] First, God's work ethic.
[time=2849] The Bible places value on work.
[time=2854] Even before the fall, God created human beings and He gave to the human beings that He created, Adam and Eve, the privilege, the opportunity of working.
[time=2867] God put them in a garden.
[time=2869] There was no sin.
[time=2870] The world was not contaminated or distorted or marred by the effects of sin.
[time=2876] And yet in that perfect world called the Garden of Eden, mankind still had the opportunity to work.
[time=2885] It's God's ethic that we work.
[time=2888] Of course we can abuse that, we can take it too far and we can become workaholics, but don't ever think that there's something innately wrong about work.
[time=2898] You see, you can suffer from stress, the excess of stress,
[time=2904] burdens, pressures, work, but you can suffer just as greatly
[time=2910] and perhaps even more dramatically from a lack of stress.
[time=2916] A lack of purpose, a lack of work in your life.
[time=2923] The only people who are happily retired are the people who retired from one job to another.
[time=2931] Now the other job may be a habit of golf.
[time=2934] It may be a habit of keeping their lawn immaculate, but the person who retires from work is only happy if they found some other work to do.
[time=2944] Because God has made us to work.
[time=2947] Of course again we can abuse it, we can press it too far, we can get out of balance, but God's ethic is to work.
[time=2956] It's also God's economy for us to work.
[time=2960] God has a simple economic formula.
[time=2963] It is this.
[time=2965] You work hard, you save your money, and you ultimately prosper.
[time=2972] It doesn't sound as sophisticated as the laugh or curve.
[time=2976] It's not as complicated as Reaganomics.
[time=2979] It's just simple, godly advice.
[time=2983] You work, you save, you prosper.
[time=2987] We just read that a moment ago.
[time=2990] Proverbs 28, "A faithful man will be richly blessed,
[time=2996] but the one eager to get rich will not go unpunished." Proverbs 13, 11 says, "Disonest money dwindles away,
[time=3007] but notice this economy.
[time=3009] But he who gathers money little by little makes it grow."
[time=3016] Many times in our world we're always trying to learn the tricks of the trade.
[time=3022] And if we would simply concentrate on learning the trade and adding to the learning work we'd find great prosperity.
[time=3031] And you see the whole system of gambling and the lottery says, "I don't want to work.
[time=3037] I don't want to save.
[time=3042] I just want to have one lucky day in my life, and that's all I need." Nothing could be more true of the old adage.
[time=3051] Easy come.
[time=3053] Easy go.
[time=3055] Finally, this battle between work and fantasy, not only contradicts God's ethic and God's economy, it also contradicts God's sense of an employee.
[time=3067] You know, as we study through the book of Colossians, I was so impressed that God places great value on the employee
[time=3075] who works hard, who earns their money.
[time=3078] And God honors those who are faithful, who are responsible,
[time=3084] who work as good employees.
[time=3087] And everything about gambling and the lottery says, "Hey, you don't want to get bogged down in the job.
[time=3093] You don't want to work the rest of your life." I mean, just look at this.
[time=3097] If you could win one time, 2.4 million dollars a year,
[time=3104] that's worth taking a chance.
[time=3107] You've missed the whole point.
[time=3109] God has made you, and He's made you to work.
[time=3113] There's a third battle, and it's the battle between being a servant of Christ or a slave to sin.
[time=3124] Jesus said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.
[time=3129] And if the Son shall set you free, you shall be free indeed."
[time=3135] What Jesus was talking about is the slavery of the soul.
[time=3139] We know that things like alcohol and narcotics can be addictive,
[time=3145] but so can gambling.
[time=3147] Estimates range anywhere from a low of 4 to a high of 11 million compulsive gamblers in our country today.
[time=3158] Perhaps as many as 11 million compulsive gamblers.
[time=3164] One sheriff out west confiscated and impounded a slot machine.
[time=3170] He was told by the prosecutor, "There were no laws in the books to authorize them to do that." He said, "I found one." It's in the hunting and fishing code, which says, "It is unlawful to use a steel device to trap a dumb animal."
[time=3185] And he said, "With that in mind, I have confiscated and impounded the slot machine."
[time=3192] And you know that's a little too close to the truth.
[time=3196] We as human beings can become addicted to about anything, and there may be 11 million of us who are addicted gamblers.
[time=3205] Allow me to trow you this tragic story firsthand.
[time=3210] An individual had gotten into a small financial problem, and I do mean small.
[time=3217] In order to solve his financial problem, this individual embezzled money from the firm for which he worked.
[time=3225] With the hopes that he could go to Las Vegas, there in Las Vegas, he would gamble the money, make back what he had gambled plus enough for him to live off.
[time=3235] He would solve all of his problems.
[time=3237] So he embezzled over $25,000 one night.
[time=3242] Went to Las Vegas, played it all and lost it all.
[time=3248] Now, instead of having a small financial problem, he had a small financial problem, a $25,000 problem, and a lawsuit.
[time=3263] But he learned his lesson.
[time=3265] He played red when he was supposed to play black, so he went to his insurance company, cashed in all of his insurance policies, got all of their cash value, took all of his savings, took any money he could find anywhere, sold furniture from his house, took another plane to Las Vegas, because he was going to win this time, and he lost it all.
[time=3287] Because he was a slave.
[time=3291] He was a slave to his appetites.
[time=3294] He was a slave to gambling.
[time=3296] The 1976 Commission on Review of the National Policy towards Gambling reports.
[time=3302] Participation in illegal gambling is greater in states where legal gambling is available,
[time=3308] in states where no form of gambling exists.
[time=3312] The point of our governmental study is this, if you legalize gambling, don't kid yourself in the same.
[time=3319] Well, then we won't have an illegal bookie running something out of his shop.
[time=3323] No, if you legalize gambling, then what happens is more illegal gambling comes
[time=3330] because the gambler's appetite is addictive, and he has to have more.
[time=3336] She's got to have one more opportunity.
[time=3339] More ironic says this state report.
[time=3343] Gambling addiction has mounted in states with gambling being legalized, while the government is often called to treat the victims.
[time=3352] The New Jersey State Lottery Commission has made a $75,000 grant
[time=3359] to research the nature of compulsive gambling.
[time=3363] Isn't that ironic?
[time=3365] Over here they're saying gamble.
[time=3368] Take a risk, take a chance, and then with the money they make on it, they got to come over here and say, "Okay, now we've got to figure out a way.
[time=3375] How do we treat these compulsive gamblers?" One sociologist puts it this way.
[time=3381] "It is ironic," says sociologist Mark Abraham.
[time=3386] "The same state that urged people to stay in school, seek a job, train themselves, and through hard work, preserve and sacrifice now also is encouraging the same people
[time=3402] to take their chance on a lucky number in the lottery.
[time=3406] The state was selling one message with its right hand and the other message with its left hand.
[time=3413] As human beings we can become a slave to sin very quickly.
[time=3419] Allow me to give you four simple observations about gambling in Atlantic City.
[time=3427] Since that has been legalized in Atlantic City, New Jersey, one Atlantic City has the third highest welfare rate in the United States of America.
[time=3437] Two, its unemployment rate is the same with no improvement with legalized gambling.
[time=3443] All the jobs that it supposedly was going to create in the revenue, it was going to bring in to stimulate the city, unemployment is the same.
[time=3451] Three, businesses are down, except for one, the rescue mission's business is up 1,000%.
[time=3460] And four, the crime rate has exploded.
[time=3464] From 100 crimes per thousand in 1977 to 313 crimes per thousand people
[time=3474] just four years later with the legalization of gambling.
[time=3480] The Bible, I think, is clear.
[time=3482] Although it never brings to our attention the word gamble, lottery, or bet
[time=3489] that gambling is a lousy wager with your life.
[time=3495] However, it does commend us to be a different kind of gambler, a gambler for Christ.
[time=3520] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Dennis Kirschner and Teresa Rust.
[time=3529] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3532] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3540] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3542] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3550] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3553] I ask you to forgive me of my sins and to cleanse me today.
[time=3557] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us?
[time=3564] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3571] To receive a copy of your decision or the booklet entitled "Contemporary Counterfeits" please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3585] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1367 or use the sermon title "What the Bible Says About Gambling and the Lottery" and please enclose a gift of $3 to help to pray the cost of providing this table.
[time=3606] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club,
[time=3614] a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry.
[time=3617] To learn how you can become a member of the Founders Club, please write directly to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
