[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] There are some unknown facts, at least unknown to many, about the issue of abortion.
[time=112] Few people who consider that alternative realize that at the very moment of conception,
[time=118] before that fertilized egg attaches itself to the wall of the uterus, the sex of that
[time=124] new child has already been determined.
[time=128] And before the 24th day, after conception, before most women know that they're pregnant,
[time=135] that little child's heart has already begun to beat.
[time=153] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=157] We're glad you've joined us for the morning worship service from our new sanctuary.
[time=162] Today's study is entitled, "What the Bible Says About Abortion?" At the heart of the abortion issue is the question, "When does life begin?" If at birth, then abortion is simply a matter of birth control.
[time=176] If at conception, then abortion, no matter how cleverly worded, is murder.
[time=181] You may be surprised how directly the Bible speaks to this issue.
[time=185] Most casual readers of the Bible and many serious students of the scriptures have mistakenly assumed that abortion is a modern issue.
[time=193] Consequently, many have erroneously concluded that the Bible does not address this subject.
[time=198] Our study today brings the timeless insight of the scripture as well as modern scientific knowledge to enlighten us on the ancient issue of abortion.
[time=209] We encourage you to locate your Bible and study along with us.
[time=213] Our special music today includes the sanctuary choir and orchestra performing the Lord reigns.
[time=219] And, Stephen Maria Gardner, the Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=229] Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=235] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=240] Now, here's Rick.
[time=243] We welcome you, and we welcome our friends who join us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=248] It's our privilege to hear our choir and orchestra sing and play together a beautiful anthem of praise that was written in the dedication of our new sanctuary.
[time=259] If you were here for the dedication services, you had the privilege of hearing this song, and we've asked them to sing it again because of its power, its majesty, and the way that it directs our worship to the Lord.
[time=281] And, Stephen Maria Gardner, the Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=335] The great's on high, the great's on high, the great's on high, the great's on high.
[time=517] Let the people shout for joy, amen.
[time=524] That is a great privilege to shout for joy that Jesus is indeed Lord and mighty powerful at that.

[time=1234] I can't afford to be running ahead on my own only hand in hand will we make the journey home
[time=1250] and Lord the world is wandering in darkness, blinded by master lies and misery
[time=1261] if only they could see the truth that sets me free
[time=1268] oh Lord I pray let them see your truth in me
[time=1277] let the world see in me, all that one can be, let them see Jesus
[time=1292] let me think from the view till all that is left is you
[time=1299] let them see Jesus, Jesus in me
[time=1314] let the world see in me, all that one can be, let them see Jesus
[time=1328] let me think from the view till all that is left is you
[time=1337] let them see Jesus, Jesus in me
[time=1347] the world really needs to see not perfect people who never make a mistake
[time=1353] but people who lean on him and in whom he can be seen
[time=1366] thank you Steve Maria the ministry of music is excellent but the message is so clear
[time=1373] this morning I would like to read a testimony for you from a lady in our church who would
[time=1380] very much like to be able to share it with you face to face but the content of her testimony
[time=1386] contains things that members of her family chiefly her father and her son do not know
[time=1393] and she believes it's not the right time for them to be told that personally and so she is not able to share her testimony with you face to face but ask me to do it it of
[time=1405] course follows our theme of today's study and that is abortion in the letter she's given
[time=1411] to me she expressed a biblical perspective so excellently she writes in 1977 when I had
[time=1421] mine referring to her abortion it was too easy to get one and the other alternatives
[time=1427] were there of course but not mentioned as vocally as they are now I was so ill with
[time=1436] my pregnancy I could not even keep water down and needed to be hospitalized but unfortunately
[time=1447] I chose the clinic it grieves me that the father of my child felt no responsibility or regrets
[time=1458] I spoke to a morality class two years ago in a high school for the right to life and
[time=1464] I was grieved that I could reach the girls but not the boys it was as if it was an all
[time=1471] girl problem which is not true there are also many statistics now showing that often the
[time=1480] girl does not start grieving for the loss of her baby till five to seven years later
[time=1488] that applies to me I started to become aware that I had done something wrong when I dedicated
[time=1495] my life to the Lord in 1979 and started reading the Psalms that we are fearfully and wonderfully
[time=1503] made I was counseled at the clinic but only by evolutionary tactics and informed that
[time=1511] my child was not a real being but by the twelfth day of conception my baby's heart
[time=1517] was beating and the creation is of God not of evolution by 1983 the grief was unbearable
[time=1526] and the guilt was constant anguish by this time also the right to life movement was loud
[time=1534] and clear calling women murderers is not healing and I felt unworthy to be a mother
[time=1544] which I was soon to be the result was my breakdown but that's when God started healing me I had
[time=1553] to learn the grieving process and actually allow myself to grieve for my baby and that
[time=1560] was very helpful to me I even named my baby which also helped I learned to accept God's
[time=1570] forgiveness and I truly do claim Psalm 32 every day and learn to accept that God forgave
[time=1580] the guilt of my sin also that set me free and when I accepted God's freedom my whole
[time=1590] life was changed it is my deepest prayer that the girls who have had abortions except not
[time=1599] only God's forgiveness but his freedom from the guilt for the girls who are considering
[time=1606] having abortion I pray that they accept that their child is fearfully and wonderfully made by God and allow God and his people to love and support them through this painful lonely
[time=1618] time into our teens whose sexuality is becoming stronger every day to allow God's principles
[time=1627] and not the worlds to be hid in their heart and to control their actions would you pray
[time=1637] with me our God as we bow before you today the words fearfully and wonderfully made echo
[time=1645] forth from your scriptures and we today would want to know your will and we would want to
[time=1652] follow your way and we would pray this morning as we discuss this issue of abortion that there
[time=1659] will be clarity of teaching that no one would miss the concept of life that you have created
[time=1666] and Father we pray also for those women who are here who have had abortions that they
[time=1674] might not only know that it is sin but that you stand ready to forgive we pray that you
[time=1682] would heal their hearts we pray for men the culprits and the cowards who have made it
[time=1691] somebody else's problem and not their own that they would see the responsibility for their behavior and that you would trouble their hearts to be responsible we pray that
[time=1703] you would move each one with compassion move an expectant mother and an expectant father
[time=1709] with compassion on a child who cannot yet speak pray that you'd move a church with compassion
[time=1716] to forgive those who have been sexually impure so that abortion isn't their only cure
[time=1722] but they would find this place to be a place of compassion and forgiveness and restoration
[time=1728] we pray today that as we try to talk about the reality of life in the womb and yet the forgiveness
[time=1737] of those who have violated it you would not use either the harshness of our teaching to discourage those who have sinned or the compassion of your forgiveness to create license
[time=1748] for those who would contemplate the same so god unless you teach us today our words can
[time=1755] be more damaging than helpful so we need your spirit to speak through me and to speak to hearts
[time=1763] we'd pray for our nation that our nation would know that the nation that honors god is blessed
[time=1769] by god we pray for our leaders today that they would know that righteousness exalt a nation
[time=1775] but sin is a reproach to any people we do not meet as a political rally father we meet as a church
[time=1783] and we want spiritual revival before we see structural reform in the halls of government
[time=1791] and so today we ask you to meet with us and you to teach we ask you to use our time together to
[time=1798] minister to the hearts of people to whom this issue is not a pressing point may they find a word of
[time=1804] encouragement particularly for those who are walking through hard valleys we pray for physical
[time=1811] strength for those who are battling cancer particularly for our dean marker and july brook holder we pray for those who are fighting joblessness or underemployment that you would give them
[time=1823] perseverance to hunt and to find the search and we pray that you would provide we pray today
[time=1831] for those who are grieving because they have wanted children and they have not been able
[time=1837] to conceive they've not been able to adopt but even the words that we say today would be a healing
[time=1844] to them god only your spirit can do this so we employ you in jesus name amen
[time=1852] it is from Psalm 139 that we come across those familiar words fearfully and wonderfully made
[time=1863] a description of what god says he has done in the creation of your life
[time=1869] end of mind if you have a copy of the scriptures i do invite you to open yours to psalm 139 and
[time=1877] we will focus our attention this morning on verses 13 through 16 i'm reading from the new
[time=1884] international translation of god's word psalm 139 13 for you created my innermost being
[time=1894] you knit me together in my mother's womb i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully
[time=1903] made your works are wonderful and i know them full well my frame was not hidden from you
[time=1913] when i was made in the secret place when i was woven together in the depths of the earth
[time=1920] your eyes saw my unformed body all the days ordained for me were written in your book
[time=1927] before one of them came to be today in our study i would like us to follow three general
[time=1936] themes the first is in this issue of abortion what are we doing secondly how did we ever get this
[time=1946] way and thirdly is there a way back this issue of abortion is one of a bottom line consideration
[time=1955] either abortion is simply the removal of tissue from a mother just as though you might remove a
[time=1967] cancerous cell an infected part of a muscle a polyp an appendix an inflamed tonsil
[time=1978] it is simply an operation to remove tissue from a mother and should be granted all the
[time=1986] liberties of an appendectomy or an abortion is actually not simply the removing of tissue
[time=1995] but it is actually the taking of a human life destroying it murder it is one of those two options
[time=2006] it is not a area where there is a lot of neutral ground of middle reasoning
[time=2012] what is it that we are doing in these procedures i'd like to answer that biblically and then
[time=2020] biologically biblically we have just read one of several if not many passages in the scripture
[time=2028] which points to the fact that life begins before birth that life actually begins at the moment
[time=2038] of conception i believe the bible teaches these two things one prenatal life is the
[time=2047] workmanship of god himself and two prenatal life is exactly that it is life first the biblically
[time=2059] considerations noting the psalm that we've read it says you created my innermost being the psalmist
[time=2068] looks to god and he said god i am not the product of sheer biology i am not the product of an
[time=2076] evolutionary process or some otherwise scientific explanation i am actually the creation of your
[time=2084] handiwork you created me but it goes beyond that and it says that god's hand was the hand
[time=2093] that formed them you nip me together in my mother's womb it wasn't just that god
[time=2105] had a general concept of creation of life but that god actually was the one who was creating that life
[time=2115] in the womb like a woman who would take two needles and join yarn together in the fashion of knitting
[time=2122] what is created there is the workmanship of her hands and that a life in the womb
[time=2132] is the workmanship of god's hand it is he that created that life from the very moment of its
[time=2141] conception i praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful
[time=2150] we come to these words fearful and wonderful the word wonder speaks of undescribable splendor
[time=2159] i don't know whether you've ever had the experience of witnessing something that is beyond your imagination but here the psalmist describes that which he cannot even think of in his mind
[time=2171] he can't conceive of it it's beyond description fearful gives insight into the concept of it's
[time=2180] something so majestic it causes us reverence for god it causes us to fall back and the worship
[time=2192] and the marvel and explain truly god is in this it reads on my frame was not hidden from you when
[time=2203] i was made in the secret place when i was rolling together in the depths of the earth your eyes
[time=2211] saw my unformed body notice this all the days ordained for me were written in your book before
[time=2221] one of them came about the psalmist is clearly identifying that god's sovereign hand is the source
[time=2230] of individual biological life that he makes us and that life exists in the womb some other
[time=2238] verses that i'll move to very quickly in jobe chapter 31 jobe is reasoning with some of his
[time=2244] antagonist and he's talking about his need to be just to his servants and he says in jobe 31 15
[time=2253] did not he who made me in the womb make them job says when i was created in the womb he made me
[time=2262] revealing it was god's creative hand in jeremia chapter one jeremia the prophet speaks about his
[time=2271] desire not to serve the lord is a prophet he was a weeping prophet and he was a reluctant prophet
[time=2279] and so when jeremia is commissioned of the lord is instincts are to say oh you've got the wrong man not me but jeremia chapter one verse five god says before i formed you in the womb i knew
[time=2297] you and before you were born i set you apart and i appointed you as a prophet to the nation this
[time=2305] passage not only tells us that god formed jeremia in his mother's womb but from that time god had a
[time=2313] plan for jeremia's life creation ended in six days god is not creating again ex nihilo out of nothing
[time=2326] but god has ordained a process called procreation that creative life can reproduce itself but it's
[time=2333] not sure biology it is his handiwork that is involved imminently with the birth of each life
[time=2340] there are other passages scripture that bring this to mind Psalm 119 73 says your hands made me and formed me give me understanding to learn your commandments
[time=2357] one of the most exciting passages to me is found in luke chapter one you'll recall that mary is
[time=2365] expecting jesus she is not being received because of the rumors oh no legitimate child
[time=2374] joseph you're not so spiritual after all the consideration should mary be taken out and
[time=2380] stoned joseph says i'm not the father where do you go to at a moment like this who would understand
[time=2387] mary pregnant and then her explanation miraculously think about that dad's if your daughter came home
[time=2396] said dad i've got some some bad news but some good news dad i'm a little bit pregnant but the good news is god made it happen it was all miracle i know most of you man and you wouldn't buy that
[time=2409] one who would believe such a story in mary's life there was one who would believe such a story
[time=2416] it was elizabeth a near kinsman who god also provided a miracle in her old age
[time=2423] miraculously beyond the years of childbearing elizabeth is now pregnant she knows that god can
[time=2431] do the miraculous in the womb there is someone who would listen there is someone who would believe
[time=2437] and so mary goes to one who would have compassion and she tells her story and at verse 39 of chapter
[time=2445] one it reads like this at that time mary got ready and hurried down into the hill country of judia
[time=2451] where she entered zechariah's home and greeted elizabeth when elizabeth heard mary's greeting
[time=2459] notice this the baby the baby leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit
[time=2468] in a loud voice she exclaimed blessed are you among women and blessed is the child you bear
[time=2474] but why am i so favored that the mother of my lord should come to me as soon as the sound of
[time=2482] your greeting reached my ears the baby and my womb leaped for joy i think that tells us quite clearly
[time=2491] that john the baptist who is that baby that leaped for joy was alive now certainly there's something
[time=2497] supernatural here in miraculous because i don't want to pretend that john the baptist heard
[time=2504] understood the language that mary spoke was fluent in hebrew or greek whatever she said and understood
[time=2510] it conceptually but i think what we do have to understand is that the emotion of the mother
[time=2517] and her understanding was translated from her life into the life and that baby who was alive
[time=2523] had a sympathetic response and children in the womb do have a sympathetic response
[time=2530] to the mother both biologically and to the mother physiologically what you eat will affect your baby
[time=2537] and what you think will affect it as well to me the evidence of scripture biblically is
[time=2546] overwhelming that the bible teaches us that life begins at conception biology who is often
[time=2556] pitted as antagonistic to biblical truth is teaching us the same thing i have come across an
[time=2563] excellent brochure that gave me these statistics but i knew that it came from a pro-life movement
[time=2569] so i wanted to check them out so i took the time to call a trusted physician a man who has practiced
[time=2575] obstetrics and gynecology for years and he has confirmed these statistics did you know
[time=2581] that at the very moment of conception the moment the male sperm cell impregnates the female egg
[time=2590] cell before that fertilized egg can even move to become implanted in the womb at that very moment
[time=2598] the sex of your baby is determined that 46 chromosomes on that xy function a moment of conception it's
[time=2606] determined you have either a baby boy or a baby girl at the very moment of conception
[time=2613] did you know that within 19 days of that moment of conception the baby's eyes are already forming
[time=2623] and by the 24th day of conception the baby's heart is beating and i would like to suggest to you
[time=2633] that the majority of women who become pregnant are not even certain that they're pregnant by
[time=2639] their 24th day and yet at that moment of uncertainty that infant's heart is already beating by four
[time=2649] weeks 40 pairs of muscles are developed by six weeks the skeleton is complete
[time=2659] by 43 days an EEG which is an electrical encephalogram can pick up brain waves of the child
[time=2673] and the fingerprints of the child are already complete at the 43rd day by the eighth week the
[time=2682] stomach the liver the kidneys are functioning and by 43 days the infant in utero responds to
[time=2692] physical stimulus and shrinks back from pain by the 10th week everything is complete the only
[time=2704] thing that is left to take place is for their growth and development by the 11th to 12th week
[time=2713] that little baby responds to touch and sucks its thumb all of these biological events are within
[time=2723] what we normally call the first trimester of pregnancy and the old school was that abortion was
[time=2732] somehow biologically acceptable within the first trimester of pregnancy yet biology has come full
[time=2741] cycle now to support the reality that life begins at conception that's not tissue it's either a
[time=2747] boy or girl the second of conception that is a living heartbeat by the 24th day let's move
[time=2758] secondly in light of these biblical and biological realities how did we ever get this way how did
[time=2768] we as a society come to the conclusion that somehow abortion is a solution to unwanted pregnancy
[time=2777] I found this quote that I find devastating to our society these are the words of a doctor
[time=2787] and we are finding the medical community is on the change the doctor is a man by the name of
[time=2794] Bernard Nathanson and he tells us how we got this way he says quote
[time=2804] we fed the public a line of deceit dishonesty a fabrication of statistics and figures we succeeded
[time=2815] in breaking down the laws limiting abortion because the time was right and the news media
[time=2821] cooperated we sensationalized the effects of illegal abortions and fabricated polls
[time=2827] which indicated that 85 percent of the public favored unrestricted abortion when we knew that
[time=2834] only five percent did we unashamedly lied and yet our statements were quoted by the media as though
[time=2844] they were written in the law we are in this dilemma for three reasons reasons number one
[time=2857] the lies of the industry you want to know why the industry lies listen to Bernard Nathanson again
[time=2865] he was the individual who was singularly responsible for the abortion laws of New York being struck
[time=2872] down and abortion on demand being granted he operated a clinic to perform abortions
[time=2880] and here are the statistics the clinic functioned on a 12 hour day sometimes a 16 hour day 8 a.m.
[time=2888] to midnight abortions seven days a week sundays included in the first year it was a five million
[time=2898] dollar business a five million dollar business he says in february of 1971 having completed
[time=2910] the housekeeping details of breaking the law in new york state i organized and ran quote the center for reproductive and sexual health another amusing um euphemism for an abortion clinic
[time=2926] it was not just an abortion clinic it was the abortion clinic you see the whole industry of
[time=2933] the abortion is literally lied to the media and the media carried it to the public of absolute
[time=2940] fabrications distortions and counter-dictory statements to the truth the second reason we got
[time=2948] this way is the language of illusion during this time period our society was thrown a great deal of
[time=2957] statements that were misleading us away from the real issue statements like this abortion is a
[time=2965] modern issue religion in the bible could not address it and the society said that's really true i didn't
[time=2973] hear about abortion when i was little it must be brand new well the bible sure couldn't help us there can i clarify a few things about abortion it is not brand new do you remember suffering through
[time=2985] ancient history and coming across names like Socrates Plato and Aristotle Plato's most famous
[time=2992] works are his republic in his republic he recommends abortion and infanticide as a means of population
[time=3000] control that is 400 years before the birth of christ his student Aristotle picked it up in his politics
[time=3007] and in book seven Aristotle says that if a woman doesn't want a child she should have abortion as
[time=3015] a preference over infanticide that is 390 years before christ it is not a new issue here is the
[time=3023] Hippocratic oath not to be confused with someone who is a hypocrite hypocrates was the father of
[time=3031] medicine in greek society and an oath was given to all physicians in his name i have reduced it to
[time=3038] a few statements not to read the whole to you but the critic Hippocratic oath goes back to 400 years
[time=3045] before christ it says i swear by Apollo the physician and all the gods i will treat to help the sick
[time=3054] never with a view to injure or wrongdoing neither why administer a poison to anyone and i will not
[time=3063] give a woman a pesserary to cause an abortion that's the Hippocratic oath this is not a new issue
[time=3074] by the first century BC the whole field of obstetrics and gynecology was well developed
[time=3083] and a doctor by the name of serenesis of the city familiar to us Ephesus had written a book
[time=3090] containing over 40 drug prescriptions that could induce an abortion by either poisoning the baby
[time=3098] in utero are causing it to be expelled from the womb and the writers contemporary to the bible
[time=3106] such as barnabas and a group of men called the teachers of the 12 made statements in the first
[time=3114] century the same time the new testament was being written and i quote from the didachi thou shall not procure an abortion and now shall not kill a newborn this is not a new issue
[time=3129] the second illusion of language that was thrust upon us is this one
[time=3137] every woman has the right to control her own body or this is only a women's issue
[time=3147] well first of all let's talk a moment about every person whether it's a woman or not having the right to control their own body is that a true statement it's absolutely absurd first of all how many of you chose to be born in the city in the state you were born in
[time=3162] how many of you chose your mother and father how many of you chose your sex how many of you chose
[time=3169] your hair or the lack thereof we don't make very many choices about our body most of us
[time=3176] take it as it comes secondly by the laws of our society do you have the right to do anything you want with your body
[time=3184] if it's your desire with your body to take drugs illegally can you do that no if it's the desire of your body to expose yourself nakedly to our community is that you're
[time=3196] right no it is not is it your right should you choose to to employ yourself as a prostitute
[time=3202] is that you're right no it's not but an unthinking society was told every person
[time=3209] ought to have the right to control their own body if they did they should have told their body body
[time=3215] don't get pregnant but they can't it's the illusion of language this one sounds so compassionate
[time=3224] every child should be a wanted child a little confession here you probably know that I'm not
[time=3232] very bright allow me to confirm that none of our three children were planned I can't say that when Kathy said I have some news sit down that I said oh boy I wanted a baby right
[time=3245] now but I want to tell you those are wanted children they may not have been planned but they
[time=3251] were wanted this insight I found so good the value of life and our society has become subjective
[time=3259] it's a matter of whether I want you or whether we want you life in and of itself is no longer
[time=3267] treated as having intrinsic worth the wholesale error from the Hippocratic code should have been
[time=3275] particularly difficult for physicians the stomach in light of abortion you see as soon as you say
[time=3282] that every child should be a wanted child you're saying and every senior adult should be a wanted senior adult or every handicap person should be a wanted handicap person or every female should be
[time=3292] wanted if you wanted a male son or if you already had two sons you want a little girl it should only be wanted if it's a little girl or you should only be wanted if you have a certain IQ
[time=3303] you should only be wanted if you have certain talents another myth is this one the termination
[time=3310] of pregnancy that is a euphemism or this one the removal of fetal tissue euphemisms are words
[time=3320] that we use to mean one thing when we really mean another in Alice's story Alice in Wonderland she
[time=3327] said this when I use a word it means exactly what I want it to mean and that's what the secular
[time=3333] society has done is they've come along and they called abortion the removal fetal tissue third way we got this way lies of the industry illusions of language and most of all the love
[time=3346] of indulgence you know why our society approves of abortion because our society approves of this
[time=3356] lifestyle I should get to do whatever I want to do I just want to indulge myself and if sex is
[time=3363] what I want I want sex and if I want sex without consequences then I have the right to indulge in
[time=3369] an abortion so I don't have to live with the consequences that's how we got this way the final
[time=3378] question is this one can we ever get back and I really believe the answer is yes these three
[time=3387] simple concepts if there's ever to be a change that first has to be a spiritual revival there has
[time=3394] to be in churches a commitment of this congregation to say I will live my life for the Lord Jesus
[time=3402] Christ I will not live my life for myself my appetite will not be my ethics I will obey him more than
[time=3409] I will obey my hormones there has to be a spiritual revival that says my body is not my toy it is
[time=3417] his temple secondly there has to be social reform compassion in our churches you see we must not
[time=3428] only decry abortion but we have to say to the young girl who is pregnant yes that was wrong
[time=3435] and if you will repent we will forgive you we will embrace you we will love you we will support you
[time=3443] our children must know that sex outside of marriage is wrong and they better never do it
[time=3449] and if they do it come to me because I'll help you through it there has to be that ministry
[time=3455] of compassion so that there are options that they can find with love and acceptance if it's not in
[time=3464] their home and if it's not in their church it doesn't matter whether it's in their community
[time=3470] it has to be here with us and thirdly there has to be state remodeling there have to be new voices
[time=3481] in government there have to be new voices on the Supreme Court who will say this is a human life
[time=3490] and although it cannot speak we have a responsibility to protect it
