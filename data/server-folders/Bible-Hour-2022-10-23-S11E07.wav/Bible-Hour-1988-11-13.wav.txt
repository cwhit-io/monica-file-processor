[time=133] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=135] Thank you for joining us.
[time=137] What does the Bible say about alcohol is the theme and title of our message today on the Bible Hour?
[time=143] You may be surprised, but you will not be disappointed.
[time=147] Rick's message is not a strong denunciation of drinking alcohol, which is the common theme of many servants on the subject.
[time=154] Instead, we will be studying the Bible for insight to help cure and prevent the spread of alcohol abuse.
[time=162] There is more to be done than to denounce all who are involved.
[time=165] So if you are struggling in this area, please don't tune this message out.
[time=170] This is a message of understanding and hope.
[time=173] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=177] Rick's text today is Proverbs 23 verses 29 through 35.
[time=184] Our special musical guest today are the John K. Singers.
[time=190] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=199] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=203] Now, here's Rick.
[time=205] Joining by way of television, it's our privilege to welcome you today that we lift our voices and praise, honoring the Lord Jesus Christ because He is alive.
[time=215] Thank you for joining us.
[time=216] Thank you, Singers, for your ministry to us today.
[time=233] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=446] [APPLAUSE]
[time=453] Well, thank you very much what a privilege it is for us today to spend this day with you and worshiping the Lord together.
[time=462] As a little chorus in your beautiful new hymnal, 588 says, "We have come into this house for one reason, and that is to worship Him."
[time=472] The second verse says, "Let's forget about ourselves and concentrate on Him and worship Him."
[time=480] So let's join our voices together this morning.
[time=483] We'll praise the Lord and lift Him up and indeed worship the Father in Heaven.
[time=489] Let's sing together.
[time=491] [MUSIC - 313 seconds]
[time=824] Today's Sunday is our privilege to record these few moments away from our morning worship service so we can talk directly with you friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=835] We like to include some information to encourage you and to give you an opportunity to write for some helpful literature.
[time=842] Coming up in the life of our church is our biggest event, The Living Christmas Tree.
[time=847] Rick, we've been working for many months as a scuffs to Mary. In fact, I think my neighbors get a little bit tired of hearing Christmas music in July and certainly my children do.
[time=855] We have been working hard and the choir continues to rehearse for our concerts that begin for the public on December 9th.
[time=863] And we're doing a cantata entitled Beautiful Savior. It's written by three people, really.
[time=869] Dave and his wife Sharon Williamson in California, and then Randy Vader lives in Alexandria, Indiana, and they collaborated together to put together this fine collection of songs depicting the prophecy first of the coming of Jesus Christ, and then the Prince of Peace, and then finally the praise and adoration that we have for him.
[time=889] Well, I'm looking forward to that. You gave me the book this past week to learn some narration, and I just thumb through it, and I'm excited about The Living Christmas Tree.
[time=897] Oh, we were excited, too, Rick, yesterday, when people came for the public distribution, and again, we're getting precariously close to all of the tickets being out.
[time=907] That's a good sign, but if you would like information concerning The Living Christmas Tree, you can call us at the church here at 4937400.
[time=917] But you need to do that Monday through Friday, and perhaps there will be some tickets left. There aren't many left, Rick.
[time=924] You know, we would love to tell you just to drop us a note, and we'll mail those to you, but it becomes a real comedy around here handling the tree tickets, because people like you write in and say, "Well, I'd like tickets to this concert," and we received your letter.
[time=938] By that time, the tickets are gone. We write back and tell you they're gone, and you write back with a different date, and by that time, they're all gone, and we really just breed some ill feelings instead of Christmas cheer.
[time=950] So we need to ask you to call. We'll give you the information over the phone, and then you'll have to pick up the tickets in person.
[time=956] We wish we could do it differently, but the logistics of 20,000 tickets just does not permit us to do that.
[time=962] So we hope you will call. The number is 4937400, and we'll give you the best information we can, if you'll call on Monday through Friday between 8 and 5 here at Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=974] Today, we want to offer you a helpful little book called Victory Over Sin, and our message today, we'll be looking at some habits that enslave us.
[time=983] Today's topic happens to be the problem with alcohol, but yours may not be alcohol or drugs. It may be a bad habit of your temper or your tongue.
[time=993] How can you have victory over sin? I wish I could tell you you simply pray. Ask God to take it away, and you never have that problem again.
[time=1001] Unfortunately, that's not how the Lord usually works in our life. Occasionally He does, but usually He delivers us through a process of spiritual growth, applying biblical principles, and this little booklet brings those principles right into your hand, and we'd love to give you a copy of Victory Over Sin, if you would simply write and request it.
[time=1025] You can receive this booklet absolutely free by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1037] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1045] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour. We do want to encourage you to write for this booklet, and we'd love to hear a letter from you telling us of the spiritual decisions that you've made in your life.
[time=1059] Perhaps you've received Jesus Christ as Savior, or you've made another spiritually significant decision. We'd love to hear from you, and so we again encourage you to write right to us here at the Bible Hour,
[time=1072] 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. Thank you again for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1101] Sometimes it's hard for me to understand why we pull away from each other so easily, even though we're all walking the same road, yet we build dividing walls between our brothers and ourselves.
[time=1131] Well, I don't care what label you may wear. If you believe in Jesus, you belong with me, and the bond we share is all I care to see.
[time=1149] And we will change the world forever if you will join with me, join and sing, sing. You're my brother, you're my sister, so take me by the hand. Together we will work until He comes.
[time=1173] There's no foe that can defeat us when we're walking side by side. As long as there's just love, we will stand.
[time=1190] The day will come, but we will be as one. And with the mighty voice, together we will all proclaim that Jesus, Jesus is King.
[time=1208] It will let go through the earth and shake the nation, and the world will see, seeing that you're my brother, you're my sister, so take me by the hand. Together we will work until He comes.
[time=1232] There's no foe that can defeat us when we're walking side by side. As long as there's just love, we will stand.
[time=1247] Stand. Stand. Stand. You're my brother, you're my sister, so take me by the hand. Together we will work until He comes.
[time=1270] There's no foe that can defeat us when we're walking side by side. As long as there's just love, we will stand.
[time=1285] As long as there's just love, as long as there's just love, as long as there's just love, we will stand.
[time=1306] I hope that you've been preparing throughout the week to be able to participate in the service with us at this time as we stand now and recite the memory verse for the month of November.
[time=1334] Please stand with me. If you're visiting with us, that verse is found in your bolt and at the bottom for you to participate as well.
[time=1344] Psalm 27 1, "The Lord is my life and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is a stronghold of my life, of whom shall I be afraid."
[time=1360] Psalm 27 1, "Thank you, you may be seated."
[time=1367] My name's Keith Attiver, and I'd like to tell you what Jesus Christ means to me. I grew up in a religious home, which wasn't a Christian home.
[time=1375] We went to church about every Sunday, and we prayed before big meals like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter.
[time=1382] My parents were pretty liberal with me, and they gave me a lot of freedom, so I pretty much set the times when I come in and what I did in my free time.
[time=1392] I ended up getting involved with the wrong crowd, so that didn't lead to a very good lifestyle.
[time=1398] But something tragic happened to our family. When I was a junior in high school, my brother got killed, and later that same summer, a friend of mine asked me if I knew where I was going to go when I died.
[time=1408] And I told her, "Yeah, I knew I'd go to heaven, or at least I thought I'd go to heaven." And she asked how I knew that, and I said that I had known Jesus, and I had learned that just from church and from Sunday school, but I only knew it in my head, and I didn't know it in my heart.
[time=1424] And several years went by, and I just kind of kept living my lifestyle the way I wanted to, which wasn't very glorifying to God.
[time=1432] And in Romans, there's a verse that reminds me of kind of the way I was. I said, "Everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial."
[time=1439] Well, a few years later, the same lady came to me and asked me how I was doing, and I had kind of changed, and I had not been partying quite as much, and I told her I was doing pretty good.
[time=1450] And then she asked me, pointedly, "How was my spiritual life?" And I told her, "I had to confess that I didn't have a spiritual life." And she recommended that I come to Blackhawk, and I get involved in the Christianity 101 class, and I told her that I would think about that.
[time=1467] And a few weeks later, I came here, and I started learning what prayer really meant, and I also started memorizing the Bible.
[time=1476] And the first verse I learned that I could remember was 1 John 5, 13, and it said, "It is written that he who believeeth in the name of the Son of God shall know he shall have eternal life."
[time=1486] And three weeks later, on November 14, 1982, that verse really came alive to me, and I committed my life to Jesus Christ.
[time=1495] And my heart changed at that time. Instead of just being ahead knowledge, I really truly knew that I was going to go to heaven and that Christ was preparing a place for me.
[time=1507] And I still have problems in my life, and I still go through trials, and I still have many of the same temptations I had.
[time=1515] But now I've got a reference point, and that's Jesus Christ, and he has laid the foundation for my life, and he can also lay a foundation for yours.
[time=1523] And together, Jesus and I will continue to build on that foundation.
[time=1530] Thank you, Keith. I'm so thankful for a young man who's not ashamed of Jesus Christ. As a high school student, a career person, the pressures of our society says, "Be ambiguous. Be nebulous. Don't get too committed. Don't be too clear in your faith."
[time=1547] Keith, I'm thankful for a young man who's not ashamed of Jesus Christ, and give testimony that he changes lives today.
[time=1555] This morning, I just want to give you some words of encouragement and update.
[time=1559] We often talk about how things are going in our church, and we're thankful for the way that God has blessed us, not just in these facilities, but that you're here, that you're worshiping with us today.
[time=1569] But across the town today, at Aboyt Baptist Church, one of our own sons, Tim Allwine, is pastoring.
[time=1575] The church had contacted us during the midst of summer. Tim would go there and preach, and during the month of September, they called him to be their pastor.
[time=1584] And Tim is there preaching today. On the north end of town, one of our sons, John Sutch, took over Wallen Baptist Church with 35 people.
[time=1593] I know that numbers don't mean anything, but they do help to visualize. Those 35 people have responded well to leadership and to God's Word.
[time=1602] Last Sunday, they had a friend day with over 140 people coming. Doesn't that encourage you today?
[time=1610] They'll allow me to tell you about what I believe is probably the second largest Baptist Church, not that labels are that important, but the second largest church, Baptist Church, in this area.
[time=1623] That's a church that doesn't meet on Sunday mornings. It meets on a Friday morning. We call it Super 60s.
[time=1629] But out of Super 60s, 5,000 senior adults have heard about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1636] Senior adults who came to a 10th anniversary celebration, hundreds of them, from over 150 different churches.
[time=1644] There are about 45 volunteers that it takes to make that possible, and somewhere between 20 and 30 people on that morning indicated their need to receive Jesus Christ as Savior.
[time=1655] So we're encouraged today that through ministry in this community, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is being declared. But the greatest declaration that can be made is the declaration of your life following Him.
[time=1668] Our God and our Father as we bow before you today, we bring to you the worship of our songs, the praise of our lips, the gifts that we have placed in an offering plate.
[time=1680] But Lord, we come to give you ourselves. And we today want you to rekindle our allegiance.
[time=1689] We want you to fan the flames of loyalty today that our hearts would be undivided and our love for you and the unity of our worship today.
[time=1699] We thank you for the growth of Fellowship Missionary Church on the southeast end of our city, for the strength that's coming to churches like Wallen.
[time=1708] We thank you for using these people to impact through Super 60s.
[time=1713] We particularly thank you for Georgia's ceaseless labor of love.
[time=1717] We pray that you would renew workers today.
[time=1720] We pray that you would renew Mike and Carolyn Ballast in Manila and Ruth and the Nuiscas and the Allen's in Bangladesh.
[time=1729] And we pray that you would renew the work permit for Ken and Alice Cole.
[time=1734] But we pray that you would renew the heart today of Sunday school teachers who are at this very moment laboring with our children.
[time=1741] We ask you to renew the allegiance of husbands to their wives and to their families.
[time=1747] We ask you to renew musicians, not just a singing mat which is melodious, but that which honors your name.
[time=1754] We pray today for lives that are shipwrecked, that they might not only find a moment of refreshment but a day of decision and transformation.
[time=1763] We pray this morning for those who are battling with enemies like depression, like alcohol, temper out of control.
[time=1773] Father today, we ask for more than just a renewal in the moment but a reformation of life.
[time=1780] We pray for the encouragement of those who've lost loved ones.
[time=1784] We thank you for the ministry that Tom and Davina Younger have had in this community and in the heritage of this church.
[time=1791] We pray that you would comfort Davina today in the death of her mother.
[time=1795] May that family as they stand together around a funeral casket find that in Jesus Christ there is one that they can say even in the face of death.
[time=1803] The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[time=1807] And so today as we study your word, we ask you to be glorified and for you to renew us.
[time=1813] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=1818] We come to a topic today in our series, what the Bible says about life's issue.
[time=1825] It is the issue of alcohol.
[time=1828] And I want to be careful from the very beginning because we often go to extremes as preachers.
[time=1835] I don't know if you do that as parishioners but preachers often go to extremes.
[time=1840] And in this subject of alcohol, we have had some great messages and days gone by.
[time=1846] Messages like Billy Sunday who could preach a powerful message titled "No Booze for Use."
[time=1852] And with that great theme, a baseball player could grab the attention of society.
[time=1858] Billy Sunday had a charisma about him that was second to none.
[time=1862] He was not educated, not that that's important, but he was skilled with a baseball bat.
[time=1868] And God called Billy Sunday off a ball diamond to preach the gospel.
[time=1872] But he came to the pulpit with the same enthusiasm that he came to home plate.
[time=1877] And Billy Sunday would make a point and when he was excited he would jump up and down and he would run across and slide.
[time=1884] I'm not going to slide, it's a new carpet.
[time=1886] But he would slide across the floor and there was great emotion to that preaching.
[time=1891] And out of that generation came a concept of prohibition, no alcohol, total abstinence in the churches.
[time=1900] That, I believe, is a great conviction.
[time=1904] I want you to know today that I do not drink alcohol.
[time=1908] I also want you to know that I don't drink coffee either.
[time=1911] And I'd like to put them right in the same boat today.
[time=1915] Actually, I don't want to do that. I really do like my job.
[time=1919] And the board of elders in our church are probably the largest per capita coffee drinkers in America.
[time=1926] But what does the Bible say about these issues?
[time=1929] One of the jingles I've shared with you before, I just like it.
[time=1933] So I'm going to repeat it today.
[time=1935] As many Christians have this posture.
[time=1937] I don't drink cus, smoke, or chew, or run around with girls who do, Rudy Tutut.
[time=1941] We're the boys from the Institute.
[time=1943] And, you know, we love a Christian, we've got some absolutes.
[time=1946] You know, absolutes are a wonderful thing administratively.
[time=1950] If we can just say, every lady wear their hair at a certain length, every boy cut their hair higher at a certain length.
[time=1958] Every skirt should be so long, every blouse should be so loose, no drink should have alcohol, or we would just eliminate problems.
[time=1967] Yet that's not what the Bible does.
[time=1969] It doesn't just legislate little rules down the line.
[time=1973] And so this morning we want to talk about what the Bible says about alcohol.
[time=1978] More than this morning, being a morning of denunciation, I'd like it to be a morning of declaration.
[time=1984] So I want to confess some things to you, confessions of a tea toddler this morning.
[time=1989] Actually, I don't like tea either.
[time=1993] I'm a Pepsi holic, but we won't meddle in that today.
[time=1998] I need to confess some things to you.
[time=2001] To my knowledge, there's nowhere in the Bible.
[time=2004] To my knowledge that it teaches and demands absolute total abstention from alcohol.
[time=2012] I don't know that it teaches that.
[time=2015] So I cannot today, as much as I would like to say, thou shall never drink.
[time=2022] I'd like to, I don't think the Bible does that.
[time=2026] Lord, as the Bible say that the Lord Jesus Christ was a total abstainer.
[time=2031] In Luke it tells us that Jesus was criticized because he ate food and he drank wine.
[time=2040] And Jesus said, "John the Baptist came, he didn't eat typical food and he didn't drink wine.
[time=2045] You condemned him." Now I, the Son of Man, come and I eat regular food and I drink wine and you condemn me.
[time=2052] I wish I could say to you, don't ever drink alcoholic beverages because the Lord Jesus never did.
[time=2058] But I believe the Lord Jesus did.
[time=2061] I cannot say to you that alcohol has no positive benefit, but I have to confess to you that the Bible uses it as a prescription.
[time=2071] Paul wrote to Timothy and he said, "Timothy, take a little wine for thy stomach's sake."
[time=2077] Now before all of you claim indigestion this morning, it is not right medically to take another man's prescription.
[time=2085] So don't race the first Timothy and say, "Aha, I have my proof text." But I want to be fair and honest with you today, that the Bible does not take alcohol
[time=2096] and define it down into a clearly denunciated pattern of behavior.
[time=2102] But I also want you to know a little history.
[time=2104] Those of you who are from Blackhawks that I know we would learn a little history.
[time=2108] But in the history of the Bible, alcoholic beverages were only available through a process called natural fermentation.
[time=2117] That is you could take either grain or fruit and you could cork it and it would naturally age, it would naturally ferment.
[time=2126] And natural fermentation brings about an alcohol percentage of somewhere around 14%.
[time=2133] In biblical times they did not have distilleries where you could make that white lightning.
[time=2139] You know that alcohol that you can take to run your automobile or to run your own body.
[time=2145] So when you read of alcohol in the Bible, when it speaks of wine and of strong drink, it is not speaking of Jack Daniels, Seagram 7, and the powerful tonics that are advertised so freely in our culture.
[time=2160] It was simply talking about a naturally fermented drink.
[time=2164] And secondly, the naturally fermented drink was almost always added to water
[time=2171] and mixed in a diluted form.
[time=2174] So when you read the scriptures and you discover somebody had wine to drink, please don't picture them down at the local bar with a fifth of whiskey downing the whole thing, that's the wrong image to connote.
[time=2186] The image that needs to be connoted, it was a drink that was available in biblical times, it was a drink that was diluted in biblical times, and it was a drink that was acceptable in biblical times.
[time=2197] But if you have a Bible today, I'd like to take your attention to the passage that I believe teaches us clearly of what God's view of alcohol would be.
[time=2206] That's found in Proverbs 23, and beginning with verse 29.
[time=2212] Proverbs is found in the middle of your Bible, please don't hesitate to look it up at the table of contents, or if you can open your Bible to the middle and you find Psalms, Proverbs is the next book.
[time=2225] Proverbs 23, verse 29, who has woe, who has sorrow, who has strife,
[time=2236] who has complaints, who has needless bruises, who has bloodshot eyes,
[time=2243] those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine,
[time=2250] do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly.
[time=2258] In the end it bites like a snake, and it poisons like a viper.
[time=2265] Your eyes will see strange sights, and your mind imagine confusing things.
[time=2272] You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on the top of the rigging.
[time=2279] They hit me, you will say, but I'm not hurt.
[time=2284] They beat me, but I didn't feel it, when will I wake up so I can find another drink?
[time=2295] I'd like to suggest that from these verses God tells us three things about alcohol.
[time=2302] Let me give those to you very quickly.
[time=2304] First, it is divisive, secondly, it is dangerous, and thirdly, it is deceptive.
[time=2312] I begin by saying it is divisive.
[time=2315] It begins in verse 29 and says, who has woe, that's grief, that's excessive,
[time=2321] continual sorrow, that's not a bad day, that is a life where things habitually
[time=2327] and continually go wrong, who has strife, who has tension
[time=2333] between husband and wife, and between parents and children.
[time=2337] Who has complaints?
[time=2339] The endless you should have, or I can't believe you did that one again.
[time=2346] The answer is those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.
[time=2354] It's poetic here, it's illustrative.
[time=2357] Please note that what's being talked about at this point is not the alcoholic, this is the social drinker, this is the individual who says those who linger, you know, they're just around together, they're just talking with the boys, they just got together with some of their friends, and they go to sample.
[time=2375] You know, I've got this new vintage bottle, you will have to try it.
[time=2380] This is the social one.
[time=2382] This is the individual who has all of the stigmas that society approves of.
[time=2388] But the alcohol is a source of constant division in their home and in their life.
[time=2395] The divisiveness of alcohol in our society has become so strong that January the 18th of this year,
[time=2402] Newsweek Magazine made it their cover and feature story called The Effects of Alcohol on the Family.
[time=2411] It went on for pages and pages and article upon article talking about the damaging effects of alcohol.
[time=2419] And they make this comment which I found to be so insightful.
[time=2423] The feature cover says alcohol in the family and it points out that the liver, fearfully and wonderfully made, can often outlast the spouse and the children.
[time=2437] It is one of the greatest causes of marital problems in our society.
[time=2445] It is divisive.
[time=2446] It is so divisive that alcohol and the issue over it has actually taken churches and it has ripped them apart.
[time=2454] That's why in Romans chapter 14 Paul lists that as a questionable item and he says,
[time=2460] "If it's going to divide the Church of Jesus Christ, I won't do it."
[time=2466] Alcohol is divisive.
[time=2468] It is also dangerous.
[time=2470] Notice that it says in verse 31, "Don't gaze at wine when it's red, when it sparkles in the cup,
[time=2479] and when it goes down smoothly." It sounds like a wine cooler commercial, doesn't it?
[time=2485] Then note, in the end it bites like a snake.
[time=2492] Its venom is like that of a viper.
[time=2497] Solomon, speaking for God, warns us that it is dangerous.
[time=2503] Allow me to share some statistics with you.
[time=2506] First of all, in the fourth special report to the United States Congress by the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
[time=2513] these statistics became available.
[time=2516] Five of the ten major causes of death in America are directly attributable to alcohol.
[time=2525] They are cirrhosis of the liver, accidents, alcoholism, suicide, and homicide.
[time=2536] If you're going to die in America, those are five of the ten leading causes of death.
[time=2544] The three leading causes of death in America are cardiovascular failure, second cancer, third, the effects of alcohol.
[time=2555] Alcoholism and the effects of it are the largest controllable medical problem in our society.
[time=2565] We don't have a cure for cancer, and we do not have a cure for many of the heart problems,
[time=2573] but alcoholism is a voluntary health problem that we choose to engage in.
[time=2582] These statistics come not from a conservative religious journal, but from a book called
[time=2589] Understanding Human Behavior, from a secular viewpoint it says, 50% of all fatal accidents include alcohol.
[time=2599] 65% of all murders include alcohol.
[time=2608] 30% of all suicides include alcohol, and if you are involved in alcohol,
[time=2616] the probability of suicide is 60 times greater than that of the general public.
[time=2622] 40% of all salts and 60% of all child abuse cases, alcoholism played a role.
[time=2633] But beyond those statistics of crime, it's physically dangerous in a number of other ways.
[time=2639] According to Wall Street Journal, August the 5th of this year, alcohol can injure unborn children.
[time=2649] According to Women's Magazine, alcohol can be linked to high cholesterol, breast cancer, and increased risk of stroke.
[time=2659] Alcohol is not only dangerous for us physically, it's dangerous for us psychologically.
[time=2665] And the point of the article was simply stated that there is a strong relationship between
[time=2676] drinking and depression.
[time=2679] Please don't misunderstand, I'm not saying that depression and alcohol go hand in hand,
[time=2685] but the article is saying that if you drink, the end result of drinking is usually not,
[time=2691] "I feel so much better," it's, "I feel so much worse."
[time=2698] But most importantly, alcohol is dangerous to us spiritually.
[time=2703] And again, I wanted to go to secular sources so you wouldn't say, "Oh, that's conservative Christianity."
[time=2709] That's some narrow-minded church.
[time=2712] There is a classic manual called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatry.
[time=2720] It is the Bible of that industry and it is a fine work.
[time=2724] I would like to offer this quote to you from the DSM edition three.
[time=2730] Although alcohol is basically a central nervous system depressant,
[time=2736] it initially affects what we often view as a dis-inhibitoring phenomenon.
[time=2745] Let me explain that.
[time=2747] God has made us with what we call inhibitions.
[time=2751] Some of those inhibitions are born within us.
[time=2755] Other than inhibitions are given to us being taught to us by parents and teachers and role models.
[time=2762] And inhibition is my inner awareness that I probably shouldn't do that.
[time=2767] And according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatry, the very first effect of alcohol on your body or mind is that it takes our inhibitions and it deadens them.
[time=2781] We no longer become inhibited.
[time=2783] That's why somebody who is very quiet and reserved after they've had a few drinks suddenly becomes the life of the party.
[time=2790] They are no longer inhibited.
[time=2793] But the danger of that inhibition is this.
[time=2797] Once our inhibitions go, that is the seat of our moral judgment.
[time=2802] And many of us have failed in our lives spiritually and morally
[time=2809] because our inhibitions were weakened by alcohol.
[time=2813] There is nothing more lethal than alcohol and driving.
[time=2820] And there is nothing more spiritually lethal than alcohol and sexual temptation.
[time=2828] Because the alcohol affects our inhibitions and when we know, say no, we laugh and say yes.
[time=2837] Psychology today in January of '86 had this article.
[time=2841] What happens when you drink?
[time=2844] In the subtitle, alcohol can turn pussycats into tigers when strong desires clash with alcohol.
[time=2853] The quote is this.
[time=2854] When both impulse, that's my urge.
[time=2857] I want to do something, clashes with strong inhibitions.
[time=2861] I know I shouldn't.
[time=2864] The result is a more extreme response to the cognitive behavior to inhibit.
[time=2875] In simple terms, it's simply saying this.
[time=2878] As alcohol enters our body, a great conflict emerges between inhibitions.
[time=2883] I shouldn't.
[time=2884] And impulse, I think I will.
[time=2887] And the alcohol has the effect that it inhibits the inhibition.
[time=2892] And it makes the impulse even stronger.
[time=2898] The bottom line is that alcohol is dangerous.
[time=2903] There's a statistic that I think you should learn.
[time=2906] It is this one.
[time=2908] That 20 to 30 percent of all alcoholics, 20 to 30 percent of all alcoholics,
[time=2918] become alcoholics through the misuse of beer and maintain that level of behavior,
[time=2927] never using any other alcoholic beverage other than beer.
[time=2935] Finally, I believe the Bible tells us here that it is deceptive.
[time=2940] Versus 33 through 35, say your eyes will see strange sights in your mind, imagine confusing things.
[time=2949] And then this analogy, you'll be like one sleeping on the high seas lying on top of the rigu.
[time=2957] They hit me, you will say, but I'm not hurt.
[time=2960] They beat me, but I don't feel it.
[time=2963] When will I wake up so I can take another drink?
[time=2969] It is deceptive.
[time=2971] First of all, it's deceptive because it appears good and turns out bad.
[time=2976] Remember, it says it sparkles in the cup.
[time=2980] It goes down smoothly.
[time=2984] It appears to be good.
[time=2986] It appears to be a desirable and pleasant commodity.
[time=2991] We've built upon its desirableness as a society.
[time=2995] There's nothing more humorous on TV, including the Bill Cosby Show, than a good beer commercial.
[time=3002] Let's face it, whether you prove a beer or not, the commercials are hilarious.
[time=3007] I love the one where it's like a spaceship of aliens coming down, and the man walks into the kitchen, sees him, comes back, and his wife said, "Who was it?" He says, "I don't know, but he looked like your cousin Willie.
[time=3019] I just like that one." They're hilarious, and what that is all part of is the deceptive.
[time=3028] Something that funny can't be that serious, and it is.
[time=3037] You see, when we hold it in our hand, we see the upside.
[time=3041] It's not until it goes down into us that we see the downside.
[time=3047] It is deceptive in its effects on our body.
[time=3051] The picture-esque wording here is great.
[time=3053] Your eyes will see strange things.
[time=3057] The effects of alcohol will cause you to imagine things and to see things that aren't there.
[time=3064] The effects of alcohol will make you like a man on the ship.
[time=3068] The ship that's going back and forth, rocking and reeling.
[time=3073] Its effects on our body are amazing.
[time=3077] Just one ounce of alcohol, one ounce has this effect on our body.
[time=3082] First of all, it slows our muscle response time by 17%.
[time=3090] The time required to make a decision, 9.7% longer.
[time=3096] The increased air due to lack of attentiveness, 35%.
[time=3104] The increased air due to lack of muscular coordination, 59%.
[time=3111] These statistics, again, are not coming from a Christian perspective.
[time=3115] These are secular studies that are done.
[time=3119] It is deceitful.
[time=3121] But I think the greatest deception of alcohol is found in verse 35.
[time=3125] They hit me, you will say, but I'm not hurt.
[time=3130] They beat me, but I don't feel it.
[time=3134] Deception is this.
[time=3136] Alcohol has the ability to deceive you into saying these words.
[time=3141] I don't have a problem.
[time=3145] Here's a man who says, I got hit.
[time=3149] I don't have a problem that didn't hurt me.
[time=3152] They beat me, I didn't feel a thing.
[time=3155] I'm doing fine. I can manage my problems.
[time=3160] Okay.
[time=3162] The greatest effect of alcohol in our lives is it causes us to deny the reality of our need.
[time=3172] Again, allow me to quote from the diagnostic and statistical manual of psychiatry.
[time=3177] This is their definition of when there is an abuse of alcohol.
[time=3182] And I don't want to call anybody an alcoholic. That's a label.
[time=3185] But somebody who has a problem with alcohol, here's how you can decide.
[time=3189] One, continuous are episodic use of alcohol for at least one month.
[time=3197] That's simply saying that if for a month you stay on the bottle, of course you have a problem.
[time=3203] But even if there are just a month period of time where there are episodes or you return to it,
[time=3209] you have an alcohol problem.
[time=3211] Two, social complications of alcohol such as arguments are difficulties with your family.
[time=3222] Violence, mist work, being fired are legal difficulties such as being arrested for intoxicating behavior,
[time=3233] traffic accidents while intoxicated, or other problems with the law.
[time=3239] If any of those things are true, you have a problem.
[time=3244] Three, either psychological dependence, that is a compelling desire to use alcohol,
[time=3251] or a tolerance where you need more alcohol to achieve the same effect.
[time=3260] If any of those are true, you have an alcoholic problem.
[time=3265] But I want to encourage you today that there's great help for you.
[time=3269] I want to discourage you first of all.
[time=3272] In talking with one of our counselors this past week, he reported that of all the people he asked to work with,
[time=3278] the hardest are those engaged in substance abuse.
[time=3282] You have picked a tough one, but there is help for you.
[time=3287] I would like to read to you the 12 steps of alcoholics anonymous because I find it to be a wonderful and helpful organization.
[time=3296] If you're a note taker, just take a breath, you won't get them.
[time=3300] But here are the 12.
[time=3302] One, we admit we are powerless over alcohol and that our lives have become unmanageable.
[time=3309] Two, we've come to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
[time=3319] Three, make a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God.
[time=3326] Four, make a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
[time=3332] Five, admit to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
[time=3337] Six, we are entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
[time=3343] Seven, humbly ask God to remove our shortcomings.
[time=3347] Eight, make a list of all persons we have harmed and become willing to make amends.
[time=3352] Nine, make direct amends to such people whenever possible, except when to do so would injure them.
[time=3360] Ten, continue to take personal inventory when we were wrongly prompted, admit it.
[time=3368] Eleven, seek through prayer and meditation to improve our awareness of God.
[time=3374] Twelve, have a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps.
[time=3379] Now let me boil it down to three steps that I would give you today that incorporate some of these.
[time=3385] And you can not only take them to note, but you can take them to heart.
[time=3389] One, if this is a problem in your life, please, I beg you, please admit it.
[time=3400] There is no hope for anyone who denies their problems, be it alcohol or anything else, please admit it.
[time=3410] Two, ask Jesus Christ to come into your life, to forgive you of your sins and to be your savior.
[time=3421] I doubt that he will instantly deliver you and take the urge of alcohol away.
[time=3426] He rarely does that, but if you will ask him to come into your heart, he will first forgive you,
[time=3433] and secondly, he will be a new resource in your spirit to enable you in three.
[time=3440] Admit yourself to a quality counseling program.
[time=3444] Be it alcoholics, anonymous, private practice, somewhere seek professional help.
[time=3454] Now let me boil it down.
[time=3456] What is it that I am asking this church to do?
[time=3459] First of all, if you are a teenager, please never give in once to the popular urge of the party.
[time=3472] Don't ever give in once, because it affects your inhibitions and your ability to say no the next time.
[time=3479] Secondly, if you would be a leader in this church, we insist that you be an abstainer,
[time=3485] because it's dangerous, it's divisive, and it's deceptive.
[time=3491] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our special guest, the John K. Singers.
[time=3496] John K. is a dear friend of mine and was the former minister of music right here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=3502] Our message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks, and certainly is timely for this day and age.
[time=3507] If you've made a decision today concerning your relationship with Jesus Christ, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3516] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can bow today and pray this prayer.
[time=3522] I know that I have sinned against you and I ask your forgiveness, and I ask you to come into my heart and cleanse me and make my heart pure.
[time=3532] Thank you for this opportunity, in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3538] If you prayed this brief prayer and trusted Jesus Christ as your Savior, we'd like to hear from you.
[time=3543] Would you write us? And when you write, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3552] To receive a copy of "Your Decision" or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Victory Over Sin,"
[time=3558] please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3565] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request take number 1369
