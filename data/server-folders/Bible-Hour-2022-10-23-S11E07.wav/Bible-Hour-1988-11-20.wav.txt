[time=90] The use of drugs in our society illegally and as a recreation those are not the problems.
[time=119] Actually, they are a symptom of an even greater problem.
[time=137] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=141] Thank you for joining us.
[time=142] Rick's comments a moment ago might have surprised you.
[time=145] Of course, drugs are a major problem in our society today but the point of today's study goes beyond the obvious.
[time=151] Today we raise two questions.
[time=153] Why do so many people in our society use drugs illegally and how can we learn to say no?
[time=159] We invite you to study God's word with us today as we investigate what the Bible says about drugs and perhaps more significantly learning to say no.
[time=168] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us. Rick's text today is Hebrews chapter 11 verses 24 through 28.
[time=177] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=182] Other special music includes a number from the handbell choir and rejoice.
[time=189] The Bible hours an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=197] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=201] Now, here's Rick.
[time=203] It is a joy for us to come into this place not just because of its newness but because it represents for us opportunity to worship the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=214] We welcome you this morning to an hour of worship and we're delighted to include friends who join us by way of television.
[time=221] And we trust today that as we lift up the name of Jesus, he would be glorified and magnified.
[time=227] And as we worship him, there would come to each of our lives a deep and abiding sense of purpose that my life has a mission.
[time=235] And that mission is to know Christ and to serve him and these moments we treasure to worship him.
[time=241] Till the day he comes again and every valley is made high and every mountain is laid low and all of creation is put in balance when he comes again.
[time=250] We look forward to that day but we want to be found faithful and to him until the day he comes.
[time=280] We pray that the day he comes again and the day he comes again and the day he comes again and the day he comes again.
[time=296] Jesus, play in the glory of the Lord.
[time=309] Shall we be healed and all flesh shall sing together for the love of the Lord as well can be.
[time=336] Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain may go.
[time=353] And the crooked, strange and the rough places play and all flesh shall sing together for the glory of the Lord.
[time=378] Shall we be healed and all flesh shall sing together for the love of the Lord as well can be.
[time=422] Indeed Isaiah did promise that the Lord would come, the glory of the Lord would show forth.
[time=428] Let's continue with the song of Thanksgiving as we do a brief service found on hymn 558.
[time=441] I will act as the worship leader and you will please respond as the people and we will sing the next three songs.
[time=449] There's an indication an arrow next to the verses that we will sing in these three songs, five hundred fifty-eight.
[time=457] God saw all that he had made and it was very good.
[time=462] You carry the land of heart, give the mission of all the things of power filled with heart and the pride of people who pray for something you never believe in.
[time=476] You've crowned the year with your bounty and your carts overflow with abundance.
[time=481] The grasslands of the desert overflow, the hills are clothed with gladness.
[time=489] The heavens are heard with us and the valleys are nailed with rain, they shout for you to sing.
[time=496] He makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for man to cultivate bringing forth food from the earth.
[time=503] How many are your works, O Lord?
[time=507] In wisdom you made them all.
[time=509] The earth is full of your creatures.
[time=512] For heaven your thanks to the Lord for this amazing love and this wonderful peace for man, for this satisfied diversity and those hungry for their thanks.
[time=526] But I, with a song of Thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you.
[time=531] What I have bowed, I will make good. Salvation comes from the Lord.
[time=561] And the Holy Spirit is all that we have brought to you.
[time=586] [MUSIC]
[time=601] The Holy Spirit is all that we have brought to you.
[time=630] [MUSIC - 166 seconds]
[time=799] Thank you for singing with us and joining in that praise to the Lord and thanksgiving.
[time=804] Continue now with special music with the hand bells which lead a key directing them.
[time=808] Come ye thankful people come.
[time=817] [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=958] Hello again, we are so thankful that you have joined us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=963] Pete, these are perhaps the busiest days of your life.
[time=966] Well, we are continuing to prepare for the Living Christmas Tree Concerts.
[time=970] It will be coming up in just a few weeks just before we went on the air.
[time=973] You mentioned that this was the week of thanksgiving and it's just hard to believe that Christmas is right around the corner.
[time=979] It really is. We have been looking forward to these days of great opportunity and yet they've snuck up on us as though it was a surprise.
[time=988] Although we've been planning it, they're here already.
[time=990] I was surprised to note from those people that worked with the tickets that all the tickets are gone for all of the concerts that we plan to do this year.
[time=998] That's a good sign, but it's an unfortunate sign for those people who are still inquiring about tickets.
[time=1003] I really wish we could tell you to call or write for tickets, but I have to ask you to do just the opposite.
[time=1009] Yesterday, being Saturday, I stopped by the church twice to pick up things or drop things off, and each time there were people here asking for tickets.
[time=1017] And I had to tell them what I have to tell you, they are all gone.
[time=1021] Our waiting list is pages long. We'll never get to the end of it, and we really regret that we can no longer offer tickets to the ten concerts of this year's Living Christmas Tree.
[time=1031] We hope that you friends who are members of the Founders Club ordered your tickets early and have already received them in the mail.
[time=1037] We're looking forward to meeting those of you who do have tickets as you come this year.
[time=1041] Tell us a little bit about the music.
[time=1043] Well, Rick, Christmas music is obviously, I think, my favorite seasonal music.
[time=1049] We're talking about the Savior, the beautiful Savior, and it does have that traditional hymn and a beautiful Savior, Lord of the Nations,
[time=1057] and talks about the prophecy that was foretold in Isaiah that Jesus Christ indeed was coming as the Savior of the world.
[time=1065] We're unto us, the Son is born unto us, the Son is given.
[time=1069] And then it goes on to talk about the Prince of Peace, and certainly God offers a unique peace that no other person or think can offer in this world.
[time=1078] And because of that, then we finalize our program with praise to God for sending His Son Jesus into this world.
[time=1085] Well, I'm looking forward to that. I know the music will be excellent.
[time=1088] The lighting and the whole presentation will be one that glorifies the Lord Jesus, and will be a delight to each of you who can come.
[time=1095] This morning, we want to offer a booklet that I believe will be helpful to every person, whether you are a believer in Christ or only at this point saying I'm searching.
[time=1105] It's a booklet entitled Victory Over Sin.
[time=1109] Each of us have areas of our life where we struggle with temptation. Mark Twain once said, I can resist anything except for temptation.
[time=1118] How do we face temptation? How do we break some of the stubborn habits of life?
[time=1124] They may be the more conspicuous things like struggling with alcohol or drug dependence, or they may be the more settled things like struggling with our anger and temper, tongue control.
[time=1134] The same principles out of God's word apply to Victory Over Sin regardless of what our particular malady is.
[time=1142] And we have chosen this booklet as a gift to give any of you who would write and ask for it as a way of helping you in your spiritual life.
[time=1150] So if you'll request it today, we'll be glad to send you a copy.
[time=1154] We'd like to give you this copy, and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1162] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1166] Once again the address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1175] Thank you, Pete, and many of you I hope will write for that book Victory Over Sin, but I hope many of you will write whether you need the book or not to let us know how God is using the Bible Hour in your life.
[time=1189] This past week I went through some of the letters and found letters from two people who had accepted Christ as their Savior while watching the Bible Hour.
[time=1197] What a joy it was for us to know that.
[time=1200] Others shared how the ministry of music or of God's word had brought them through a time of need in their life.
[time=1206] We'd love to hear from you, so we hope you will write, and if you'll listen again at the end of the broadcast, we'll give you the address again.
[time=1213] Thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1219] [MUSIC] In seasons and streams like our dreams come and go [MUSIC] But here's the peace in our lives that survives [MUSIC] Before we know he is forever and ever and ever will cease [MUSIC] He is the Lord of peace [MUSIC] He is forever and ever and ever will cease [MUSIC] Or never and he never will last in me [MUSIC]
[time=1271] [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=1395] (audience applauding)
[time=1406] - My name is Chris Wright.
[time=1408] This morning I'd like to tell you how I came to know Jesus Christ is my personal savior and what my life was like before and after Jesus Christ.
[time=1417] Several weeks ago Rick talked about a young man in his high school Sunday school class that we're all black and slouched in his chair so low he was almost laying down.
[time=1425] That's me.
[time=1427] That was a very rough time in my life.
[time=1429] I gave my parents and family more grief than I care to think about.
[time=1433] At that time I was engaged in an open war for bailing with my parents.
[time=1437] That rebellion included open defiance of their wishes, running with the wrong crowd, stealing for the fun of it, being promiscuous, and alcohol and drug abuse.
[time=1446] Drug abuse was the most prevalent problem in my life and I'd like to talk about that this morning.
[time=1452] My path into drug abuse started when I was about 11 or 12 years old, with smoking and drinking just to be part of the crowd.
[time=1458] My nook store neighbor and I would steal booze from our parents liquor cabinets and sneak out into the woods to get drunk.
[time=1464] The first time I smoked marijuana was at summer camp when I was about 13 years old.
[time=1470] My family moved to Fort Wayne in 1976 and I promptly meant the same kind of people that I left behind, but it was different here.
[time=1479] It was much easier to get drugs than in the small town we had come from.
[time=1483] By the time I was in ninth grade, I was what you would call a problem child.
[time=1486] I lied to my parents all the time about where I was and what I was doing.
[time=1491] I did drugs almost every day before school, but once I got my driver's license, I finally had the freedom to really do some serious partying.
[time=1500] About this time, my parents started to get religious on me.
[time=1504] That wouldn't have been so bad, but they made me go to church too.
[time=1508] That created a lot of problems, as you can imagine.
[time=1511] Sunday mornings were like World War III.
[time=1514] I didn't want to go, and I made sure they knew I didn't want to go.
[time=1518] But my dad laid down the law and said if I wanted to live in his house, I would follow his rules.
[time=1523] So after a while, I just got up, got dressed, went to church, slouched in my chair, hating every minute of it.
[time=1530] Once I got into high school, I started to really experiment with other drugs.
[time=1534] I tried hash, speed, cocaine, PCP, acid, and several others.
[time=1539] I would try almost anything, but I would not stick a needle in my arm.
[time=1543] That's where I drew the line.
[time=1545] But I was a very heavy marijuana user and had to supplement my income by dealing drugs on occasion.
[time=1553] How I never hurt myself or anyone else during those years is beyond me.
[time=1557] I remember one night, writing my brother's motorcycle home from a party.
[time=1561] I was so loaded that I had to ride with my hand over one eye because I couldn't see straight.
[time=1567] How I never got hurt, I was beyond me.
[time=1570] I can only tribute my safety to the Lord watching over me.
[time=1574] After I got out of high school, my attitude started to change.
[time=1577] I saw my friends from high school going nowhere.
[time=1580] Some were dead, some were in jail, but most were just burnouts.
[time=1584] I knew that I wanted a lot more than that out of life, so I started to go to college.
[time=1589] I was still living in my parents' home and of course still going to church almost every Sunday.
[time=1593] But you know, those church services, they weren't just boring anymore.
[time=1598] They were very uncomfortable, especially during the invitations.
[time=1602] I pushed down those feelings during the invitations.
[time=1604] I always had several reasons why not to go forward.
[time=1607] I would have to give up this or that.
[time=1609] I told myself this stuff was just a bunch of fairy tales.
[time=1612] But on March 8th, 1981, I ran out of reasons not to go forward, and I went forward that day and accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior.
[time=1622] 2 Corinthians 5, 17 says, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.
[time=1626] Old things are passed away, behold, all things become new." And that became very true in my life.
[time=1631] No, all of my problems did not go away overnight.
[time=1634] But one thing that did, my language was almost transformed overnight.
[time=1639] God has blessed me mightily.
[time=1642] I have a loving wife, I have two boys and a good job, and my five-year-old boy Jeremiah just accepted Jesus in his heart three weeks ago.
[time=1649] I have found his promises are true, and he can clean up your life, too, if you only let him.
[time=1655] Let me make one thing clear.
[time=1657] Drugs are fun.
[time=1659] If they weren't fun, they probably wouldn't be a drug problem.
[time=1662] I didn't take drugs to escape from reality, but just to have fun.
[time=1666] But drugs will slowly erode your values and motivations until getting stoned is the only thing you want to do.
[time=1672] If you are a young person, following the same road that I was on, take an objective look at your life.
[time=1680] I was lucky.
[time=1682] I never got hurt.
[time=1683] I never hurt anyone else.
[time=1684] I never got arrested.
[time=1685] You probably won't be so lucky.
[time=1687] Is it worth it?
[time=1689] Is it worth it to put your parents through so much grief?
[time=1692] Would it be worth it if you killed someone or not, and it won't be a accident?
[time=1695] Christ can help you get, let your life back together before something irreversible happens.
[time=1700] If you're a parent of a rebellious child, stick to your guns.
[time=1705] Don't give in to things that go against your better judgment just to avoid conflict.
[time=1710] Lay down the law and make your children follow those rules.
[time=1713] They may hate it now, but they will respect you for it later.
[time=1716] And most importantly, pray for that child.
[time=1719] Remember, God said the prayers of a righteous man avail us much, and it did work for me.
[time=1725] Thank you.
[time=1726] Thank you, Chris, and I invite you to bow with me
[time=1733] as we pray together.
[time=1735] Our God, we're thankful today that Jesus Christ changes lives.
[time=1740] We thank you for the testimony of Chris's own story, that you could rescue him.
[time=1745] That you could release him, and that you could return him to a family, to a life of value.
[time=1753] We pray today that that story might be told again and again in a different life that you have touched.
[time=1762] We want to thank you for transforming his life today, the lives of his family, and the lives of so many who worshiped with us this morning.
[time=1772] In anticipation of a national time of Thanksgiving, God, we express to you our deep gratitude for your blessing upon us, for the spiritual gifts that you bestowed upon us, the gifts of forgiveness, the gifts of redemption, restoration, and new life.
[time=1792] We would pray this morning that there would come upon this congregation a desire to be ambassadors for Christ to speak boldly in his name.
[time=1802] We thank you today for our church, for the hundreds of people who this morning will work with our children, to teach them your word.
[time=1811] Thank you for the men, the dozens and dozens who have ushered to help people out of cars into a building to find a seat.
[time=1820] Thank you for the ladies with gentle hands, who this very moment are caring and caressing our children in the nurseries.
[time=1828] Thank you this morning for those technical minds that can run a television operation who can observe behind a computer to take care of attendance.
[time=1838] Thank you today for those who have invited friends that they might hear of the Lord Jesus this morning.
[time=1845] Thank you for this facility, its comfort, its function, the opportunities that it gives us.
[time=1852] Thank you today for the way you've blessed us and you've blessed our friends.
[time=1857] Father, we rejoice today with Westridge as they end a mortgage and their building is now paid off.
[time=1864] Thank you for the perseverance of that body of Christ and we are grateful that you have blessed them.
[time=1869] Thank you for blessing John and Tim as they pastor in other churches and this morning we would pray that your hand would be upon lives that need to know Christ.
[time=1881] We would ask you to give a ministry by your spirit of conviction this morning that each one today who doesn't know Christ would sense their need for him.
[time=1892] We would ask for comfort today for the family of David Kroll, for Judy's wife, for his son, that you would comfort him as he has lost a father, as she has lost a husband.
[time=1908] We would pray today for the family of Bernice Taylor that your word would fortify them even in the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=1917] We would pray for friends who are seriously ill, for our Dean Marker and Jack Saylor and Elsie Saylor, Marv Degas, your hand would be upon them.
[time=1928] And now, God, we ask you to put your hand upon us and to speak today, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1940] During the Reagan administration, it is noted by historians that President Reagan called for an invasion of the country of Grenada, launched an order that released airplanes to bomb Libya and declared war on drugs.
[time=1961] Of those three campaigns, it is the war on drugs that we are losing.
[time=1967] It is a battle that is of national and epic proportions,
[time=1973] but it is a battle that is local.
[time=1977] This past week in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in one drug bust, over one quarter a million dollars of narcotics were confiscated.
[time=1988] Drug raids are now status quo, not just in the major urban areas of America, but in such populous areas of rural settings.
[time=2001] Even small counties like Grant County are facing drug problems that are staggering to every dimension of law enforcement.
[time=2014] It is a war that as a society, we have been fighting for two decades, and we have been losing every day.
[time=2027] What does the Bible say about all of this?
[time=2033] In the scriptures, drugs are not mentioned as often as some of the other social maladies that we are encountering in our day and age.
[time=2043] But they are not absent from the biblical record either.
[time=2047] Both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament, there were one particular dimension of society.
[time=2055] There was one where drugs was constantly apart.
[time=2060] That dimension of society was a particular form of false religion.
[time=2065] Many of the Old Testament religions and many of the religions of the Greek world incorporated into their concept of worship the use of drugs.
[time=2077] In the Old and New Testament, then the word is translated sorcery.
[time=2082] For the sorcerer was the individual who was able to influence by the use of either a magical spell or a potion that he could concoct and by giving that potion to his individuals, he could alter their values and alter their beliefs.
[time=2101] Allow me just to share some brief references with you this morning so that you can see that in all of this concept of false religion, there was a drug culture that was a part of it.
[time=2113] Isaiah 47 verse 9 reads like this.
[time=2117] Both of these will overtake you in a moment.
[time=2120] On a single day, loss of children in widowhood, they will come upon you in full measure in spite of your sorceries and your potent spells.
[time=2132] You have trusted in wickedness and have said, "No one sees me." Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you.
[time=2143] When you say to yourself, "I am and there is none besides me." Disaster will come upon you.
[time=2151] And you will not know how to conjure it away.
[time=2156] A calamity will fall upon you that you cannot ward off with a ransom.
[time=2161] And a catastrophe you cannot foresee.
[time=2166] You will suddenly, it will suddenly come upon you.
[time=2170] Keep on then with your magic spells and with your many sorceries which you have labored at since childhood.
[time=2178] Here Isaiah speaks of the false religion of his day.
[time=2182] And when we come to the word sorcery, we often think of the black magic and even the occult.
[time=2188] And that can certainly be a part of the whole panoramic discussion.
[time=2193] But particularly when this word of sorcery is used, it's referring to that religious dimension that was using drugs
[time=2203] to influence its audience, who through the potions and the spells could alter the thinking and the concepts of its people.
[time=2213] There is an unusual expression in the book of Ezekiel.
[time=2216] In Ezekiel chapter 8 and verse 17 it says, "He said to me, have you seen this?
[time=2226] Is it a trivial matter for the house of Judah to do to testable things
[time=2232] that they are doing here?
[time=2235] Must they also fill the land with violence and continually provoke me to anger?
[time=2242] Look at them putting the branch to their nose." Here Ezekiel speaks about people doing the testable things.
[time=2251] It was false religion that involved violence and then this unusual phrase called putting the branch to the nose.
[time=2260] It is the esteem of many biblical scholars that what the branch to the nose was, was either snorting or inhaling,
[time=2269] herbs that were intoxicants.
[time=2272] Those were potions that were common in that day.
[time=2277] It's not only true in the Old Testament, it is true in the New Testament.
[time=2283] The Bible speaks very clearly of denouncing the use of drugs particularly the use of drugs recreationally, medically safe ground.
[time=2295] People have used drugs in our society to generalize in three ways.
[time=2300] First of all in a very appropriate way and that is the medical use under the guidance of pharmacists and physicians who can monitor the effects both positive and potentially negative.
[time=2312] A second use was the use of the late '60s.
[time=2317] Drugs were used to create an escape from society.
[time=2321] A society had said we are progressing in a direction and a whole body of society said we don't like that direction, so we will escape.
[time=2330] And a counterculture grew up that says we can drop out and drugs became that mode of escape.
[time=2338] Still common today.
[time=2340] But in the times in which we live the epic drug proportion that we battle is the recreational use of drugs.
[time=2348] It's the use that says it feels good.
[time=2351] I like it.
[time=2352] I like what it does to me.
[time=2353] I won't count the consequences.
[time=2355] I like it.
[time=2357] It's a lot like the individual who says for recreation I like racquetball.
[time=2361] Somebody else says I like piano music.
[time=2363] This guy says I like cocaine.
[time=2365] That's what I do at a party.
[time=2370] I would like to suggest to us this morning that drugs are not a problem in our society.
[time=2378] They are only the symptom of a greater problem in our society.
[time=2384] Just as one a young couple says we have a problem, we're not married, we're been dating, and now she's pregnant and we have a problem.
[time=2395] Sometimes for shock effect but for seriousness, I tell him pregnancy is not a problem.
[time=2402] It's the symptom of a problem.
[time=2406] And the same thing is true about our drug, a problem in our society.
[time=2410] It is not the problem.
[time=2412] It is the symptom of the problem.
[time=2414] And the root problem is that we as a society and as of individuals, we have said life exists for the pursuit of pleasure.
[time=2426] Therefore if it gives me pleasure to engage in sex without discretion, I will engage in sex.
[time=2433] Therefore if it gives me pleasure to get drunk on alcohol, I'll get drunk on alcohol.
[time=2439] If it gives me pleasure to snort cocaine, then I'll snort cocaine.
[time=2445] If it gives me pleasure to roll a joint in the puffet, then I'll roll that joint in all puffet.
[time=2450] Because the ethic of our society is that if it brings me pleasure, then I will do it.
[time=2459] That's not new.
[time=2461] Four hundred years before Christ, there was a Greek philosopher by the name of Antipas who said in his value of life, the chief duty of mankind is to seek pleasure and to shun pain.
[time=2476] It's not something new that a society would say, "This is our pursuit." But it's been put not only in the words of the philosopher, but in the words of the popular philosopher, the musician.
[time=2490] I remember growing up in the 60s, and I probably had a radio on constantly.
[time=2495] One of the groups in those days was a slow-moving group called The Turtles.
[time=2501] The Turtles had a song, and the selling point of the song was this one.
[time=2506] I won't sing it.
[time=2507] Fa, la, la, la, live for today and don't worry about tomorrow anyway.
[time=2515] Live for today.
[time=2517] When you come to the 70s, even somebody from a good background like Debbie Boone will take a song from the film and bring it to the popular world through music called You Light Up My Life.
[time=2531] And in the middle of the song, this philosophy, if it feels this right, it just can't be wrong.
[time=2542] And so our society is one that is said, if it feels good, it must be right.
[time=2549] Crosby stills a nash saying, "Well, there's a rose in the fisted glove, and the eagle flies with the dove, and honey, if you can't be with the one you love, then love the one you're with." Pursue pleasure!
[time=2563] And so here comes a society that says, "Alcohol can bring me pleasure.
[time=2567] Sex can bring me pleasure.
[time=2571] Therefore, I will pursue it." The greatest question that we face is the question, "How can we develop a different value?" If you have a copy of the Bible with you today, I invite you to open it to Hebrews, Chapter 11, where one individual faced the pleasure ethic and made a very dramatic decision.
[time=2597] His name was Moses.
[time=2600] Hebrews, Chapter 11, and verse 24.
[time=2605] By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=2616] He chose to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasure of sin
[time=2626] for a short time.
[time=2629] He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as a greater value than the treasuries of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.
[time=2640] By faith, he left Egypt not fearing the king's anger.
[time=2646] He preserved because he saw him who is invisible.
[time=2652] I have chosen this passage to focus our attention because of that critical statement that Moses chose to suffer mistreatment with the people of God than this, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[time=2672] Our First Lady has pled with us as a nation to just say no.
[time=2681] But that's not easy.
[time=2683] How does somebody say no?
[time=2686] How do you change your character?
[time=2689] How do you change your value system?
[time=2691] What is the process that develops that?
[time=2694] I believe as we look at this passage, we can see five steps in the development of a value.
[time=2701] A value is a choice that you make that becomes a characteristic of your life.
[time=2710] Let me repeat that again.
[time=2712] It was this statement that brought me to Christ as a high school student when David Burnham declared it.
[time=2719] A choice, excuse me, a value is a choice that you make
[time=2725] that becomes a characteristic of your life.
[time=2729] Moses made a choice.
[time=2733] It became a characteristic of his life.
[time=2736] The process involves five steps.
[time=2739] Step number one is personalization.
[time=2744] Every value that is yours must be personalized.
[time=2750] We all grew up in a home, whether it's a good home, a bad home, a home with good values, a home with negative values.
[time=2757] We grew up within the context of a home.
[time=2760] We grew up in the context of a larger society, and both the home, the society, and even the church are constantly placing their values upon us.
[time=2772] But there must come a time in our life where we personalize our values.
[time=2779] Moses, it tells us when he had come to age, when he had grown up.
[time=2786] You see, Moses was a little boy.
[time=2788] He was born of Hebrew parents, but he was adopted into Egyptian parenthood.
[time=2794] And his Egyptian parents raised him to be an Egyptian.
[time=2799] But the whispering ear of his biological mother was, "You are a Hebrew." And so here was a young man growing up with two sets of values.
[time=2813] Just as you and I will raise our children in a society with two sets of values.
[time=2819] They will come here on Sunday and we will teach them these values.
[time=2823] They'll enter the secular world and they'll be taught a completely different ethic.
[time=2828] And they will grow up with two sets of values.
[time=2831] Moses grew up with those two sets of values.
[time=2834] And there came a point in his life when he had to personalize.
[time=2838] He had to make a choice.
[time=2840] It doesn't matter what my mother says, it doesn't matter what my adoptive parents say.
[time=2846] This is what I choose.
[time=2850] It is the personalization of values.
[time=2854] It's most commonly felt in the transition from adolescence to adulthood.
[time=2860] That's why Mark Twain said that when a young person hits age 13,
[time=2866] they should be put in a barrel and fed with a straw through a hole until they're 15.
[time=2873] And then you plug up the hole.
[time=2876] That was Mark Twain's view.
[time=2878] He was simply noting that that is the typical time where people go through the process
[time=2884] of personalizing their values.
[time=2887] And the personalization of values usually runs very parallel to the path of the significant others in our lives.
[time=2897] What I mean by significant others is that as a person, there are those people outside of us who we view very significantly.
[time=2905] Little children look at their parents as the significant others in their life.
[time=2912] I can remember driving down the street and Rachel saying, "Daddy, do you know everything?"
[time=2921] I said, "Rachel, I know everything." And she cheerfully smiled and said, "I knew you did, Dad." I can also remember when she was seven years old, and she said, "Dad, do you know everything?" I said, "What do you have in mind?" She said, "What's 1,000 minus 900 plus 200?" "Well, we'll slow down." She said, "See, you don't know everything." As children grow up, the first significant other in their life are their parents.
[time=2950] But usually, shortly after they enter school, the parents are no longer the significant others.
[time=2958] It's the teachers.
[time=2960] I discovered something that when my daughter's entered second grade, I entered the world of ignorance.
[time=2966] Because I no longer knew anything. If Mrs. Zook said it, it's so.
[time=2971] If I said it, I'll check with her tomorrow.
[time=2975] The significant other had changed.
[time=2978] As that student grows up, you'll discover that Mrs. Zook isn't that important, nor the rest of the teachers.
[time=2985] Because somewhere in late elementary school, are surely by junior high, the desire to please the teacher is not nearly as great as the desire to please the peers.
[time=2995] You'll see that in response to the teacher asking a question.
[time=3001] You ask an early elementary student a question.
[time=3005] Every hand goes up, "Oh, call me. I know. Please don't call me." "Oh, you always call on him." You ask a junior high rare question.
[time=3017] "Here's 20 cents, lady. Call somebody who cares." You see, the desire is no longer to please that teacher.
[time=3027] My desires to impress all these students around me.
[time=3030] And if I can say something pretty sharp, they'll laugh and all really be somebody.
[time=3036] And as that personality begins to follow the path of the significant others, they start trying no longer to please mom and dad.
[time=3046] But there comes a time even later when they say, "I'll not please mom and dad. I'll not please the teacher. I'll not please the coach. I'll not please my players. All please me."
[time=3059] That is the process of personalization of values. It doesn't just happen, though, through adolescence.
[time=3068] Moses was 40. Some might read this and say, "That's a midlife crisis. Maybe it is."
[time=3075] It was a good one in his case, but he was still personalizing his values when he made this choice.
[time=3085] We go through tough times as parents because we raise our children and in the early years we just marveled how cooperative they are.
[time=3094] And we say, "How did they turn out to be so rebellious five or ten years later?" It's because we are watching them go through the personalization.
[time=3104] You see, there's a time and a little one's life when you can tell them what they're going to do and if they don't do it, you can pick them up and they will do it.
[time=3112] At our camp where I was a counselor, we had a great week. We had brought in every child from the Akron Children home to our camp.
[time=3119] And they just loved it and I like this little guy, Chester. Chester had glasses that kept slipping down in his nose and he would push him back.
[time=3127] His ears were too big on the glasses. They just couldn't get him hooked around and he had the highest squeakiest voice and Chester was always in trouble.
[time=3136] And Chester would always sneak out of the evening campfire meeting and I caught him one day and I said, "Chester, we're going to go to that campfire meeting."
[time=3146] He said, "No, I'm not." I said, "Chester, yes, you are." And I picked a little Chester up and I carried him. And immediately Chester began to quote that day's memory verse.
[time=3159] He looked up to me and in perfect King James English, he said, "Come, let us reason together."
[time=3167] And I toted a little Chester to the campfire and I sat him down and the issue was closed.
[time=3174] The next week was high school week. Some guy snuck out of campfire and I went down there and I said, "Guys, we're going back to the campfire."
[time=3182] And they said, "No, we're not." And I said, "Come, let us reason together."
[time=3188] I couldn't pick these two guys up and make them.
[time=3192] They were at a point where they were at the... I couldn't control that behavior.
[time=3197] The value had to become personalized. You can cram values on people.
[time=3203] You can teach them positively. You can do it with the right method.
[time=3206] You can do it with the wrong method, but truth is they're going to personalize that.
[time=3210] Moses personalized his value. The second step is confrontation.
[time=3215] Confrontation. Moses came to a point of confrontation.
[time=3221] He could no longer be a Hebrew on Monday and an Egyptian on Tuesday.
[time=3227] He could no longer say, "This is my mother. No, this is my mother." There came a point in his life where society said, "Who are you? What is your identification? What is your value?"
[time=3243] Confrontation in another way is opportunity.
[time=3248] Moses had to choose. If he chose to be a Hebrew, he was choosing to follow God and God's people who were slaves.
[time=3258] If he chose to be an Egyptian, he was choosing no ability and royalty as Pharaoh's grandson.
[time=3266] It was a confrontation and opportunity.
[time=3270] Your values will never truly be personalized until there is opportunity.
[time=3276] I remember in my life, I had made choices.
[time=3279] I had made a choice that I was not going to be involved in the drug scene of my high school day.
[time=3285] I wasn't going to do that, nor was I going to get involved in the promiscuity that was going on with my friends on the swim team.
[time=3293] I had decided I thought I would not do that.
[time=3296] I was 17 years old, a brand new believer in Christ, a coach from Ohio University called and said,
[time=3303] "Rick, I would like you to come down and these three other guys." We think you would be good men to try to get to come to Ohio to swim on our college team.
[time=3313] Would you come for a week? Oh, I thought, "Oh, that will be just great." I thought, "We'll go down there. We'll meet the coach. We'll play water polo. We'll swim.
[time=3321] We'll go to classes and take notes and we'll come home and say, "Ah, that's a fine academic institution." Do you want to know what a recruiting weekend is like in major sports?
[time=3330] You go down there, you meet the coach. The coach says, "You're going to dorm with this guy.
[time=3334] You're going to dorm with that guy. You'll be with that guy. Show him a good time.
[time=3337] He leaves you. Never see him again." Then these college upperclassmen say, "We've got a party for you tonight. What do you like to drink? What do you like to smoke?
[time=3346] Does anybody want something to pop? We've got a girl for you and don't worry.
[time=3350] She's been around the block and back and she's ready to go tonight." I was 17. You know what?
[time=3359] My mother and my father were 200 miles away and they'd never know.
[time=3368] Only guys that would know would be these three guys.
[time=3372] If they did it, they sure weren't going to tell. That's opportunity.
[time=3378] I discovered in my life that there was a battle that I'd never faced before.
[time=3382] It was easy to say no when there's no opportunity.
[time=3386] But how do you say no when there's opportunity?
[time=3390] How do you say no?
[time=3392] Moses was given opportunity.
[time=3394] In that day in my life, there came opportunity and I discovered something that with Jesus Christ in your heart,
[time=3402] there'll be a voice called the Holy Spirit that can call you louder than the world that will call you.
[time=3407] And if you'll make your first step a step of obedience, the rest of your steps will be a step of victory.
[time=3413] You'll come to a point of confrontation in your life.
[time=3416] I'm thankful by God's grace, I knew victory in that confrontation.
[time=3420] And that is the day that the value became mine because there was opportunity that confronted me.
[time=3426] Moses was confronted with opportunity.
[time=3429] Then thirdly, in this process, there is not only confrontation, but there must also be recognition, recognition of consequence.
[time=3440] It says here, Moses recognized that if he became a Hebrew,
[time=3446] the consequence was mistreatment with the people of God.
[time=3451] And if he chose to be an Egyptian, there was the pleasure of sin.
[time=3458] Chris, I'm thankful today that you would be honest and say there is a pleasurable side of drugs and alcohol.
[time=3464] If there wasn't, no one would be attracted.
[time=3467] But notice though the Bible admits there is a pleasure.
[time=3470] It is but for a short time.
[time=3474] But a value is a choice that we make out of confrontation when we know the consequences.
[time=3481] We know what will happen when we choose.
[time=3484] We know what pleasures we will give up and what pleasures we will keep.
[time=3488] We know what mistreatment will bring upon ourselves.
[time=3491] We know what mistreatment we will avoid.
[time=3495] That's when it becomes a value when there is recognition.
[time=3499] The last two steps we'll cover tonight, but let me give them to you quickly.
[time=3503] The fourth step is identification.
[time=3512] We've been sharing with you today songs of thanksgiving from our sanctuary choir, our hand bell choir and our ladies ensemble rejoice.
[time=3521] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks and was very pertinent for this day and age and the difficulties that we have with drugs.
[time=3528] If you've made a decision today to trust Jesus Christ as your personal savior as a result of listening to his word, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you today.
[time=3537] Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=3540] Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3547] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart and to cleanse me from the sins that I've committed.
[time=3553] I ask you to come in today.
[time=3555] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3559] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3564] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
