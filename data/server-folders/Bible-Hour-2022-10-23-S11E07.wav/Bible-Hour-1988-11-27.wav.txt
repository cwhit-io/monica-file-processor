[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] - Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=131] Thank you for joining us.
[time=132] While Rick is away, our Minister of Youth, Tim Teder will be sharing with us.
[time=137] Tim's message is entitled, "The Worth of a Nobody." We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=144] Our text today is 1 Corinthians 1, verse 26 through 31.
[time=151] Our sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=156] Other special music includes instrumental duets from Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=162] The Bible hours an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on the station each week at this time.
[time=169] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=174] And now, here's Peter Kobe.
[time=176] - Television, and we're glad that we have the outreach ministry of television to meet in the homes and hospitals of people that have the opportunity to tune in, and we're glad that they can join us for our worship service now.
[time=189] Choir sings a song that talks about the joyfulness we have and the happiness we have in Jesus, and we sing joyfully unto His name.
[time=198] [MUSIC - 131 seconds]
[time=341] [APPLAUSE - 2 seconds]
[time=348] We sing those songs because our fellowship together here is to let the Lord know that we are indeed thankful for the Spirit that He's put in our hearts and the joy.
[time=357] And we have an opportunity to sing as a congregation with the choir. Now joyful, joyful we adore the number one, please.
[time=364] You'll sing the first, second, and third stanzas together of Him number one.
[time=369] [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=498] We appreciate it when our voices are lifted up to the Lord and we are indeed grateful to that we have instrumentalists in our congregation that blend their skills with ministry.
[time=508] That's true this morning as Dave and Debbie Johnson come to play for us a song entitled, "Come We That Love the Lord and Let Our Joys Be Known."
[time=518] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=674] Thank you for tuning into the Bible Hour today. Our pastor Rick Hawks is on vacation. This is a well-deserved vacation in preparation for the holiday season and we're glad that he could get away for today.
[time=686] Usually he's on the set together with me, but today we have our school administrator from the Black Hawk Christian School, Steve Longbreak. Good morning, Steve.
[time=694] Morning Pete. Just recently we had a staff meeting and you were showing some graphs concerning the enrollment of our school in recent years. It was very impressive. I'm excited about the growth of Black Hawk School. How is it going?
[time=707] It's going better than we expected it to even. The last four years we've had an increased growth every single year until the past year, 1988-89 school year, we have had to turn away 27 students from our school.
[time=722] We don't like that at all, but we're encouraged that our school is filling up like that. To take care of that, we have decided that we will try to increase the growth of our school.
[time=732] Rick, excuse me Steve, often when people hear that we've turned away students, they assume that every class is entirely full and that isn't always the case, but we are full in many of our classes. What are we going to do about enrollment in the next few years?
[time=748] We have a plan right now that will help us make it possible for students to come to our school who have desired to, and that is to increase our school starting with grades K and one.
[time=759] Next year we'll be opening a second first grade class in order to meet the needs of the people who've been asking to get into our school. We're thrilled about that.
[time=767] Well, I know that being at the worship center has provided a little bit of space for the school on the south side of State Street, but certainly besides the double tracking, we need some more space, don't we? Are there plans for additional educational facilities?
[time=783] We certainly do need more space, and we're hoping that in the near future our people will be able to put together the funds that will make it possible to build additional classrooms. We can't wait to do that.
[time=794] We believe that in 10 years we're going to be able to double our school size K through 12.
[time=800] That's wonderful, Steve. We're really excited about the Ministry of Black Hawk Christian School and the growth that we've seen.
[time=807] We love the school. We've had children in the school. We're closely associated with it.
[time=811] As we see the children go through the hall, grandparents last week visiting the grade schools. It was a very exciting time.
[time=818] While we've spoken much about the living Christmas tree, and it's right around the corner, and as I mentioned last week, all tickets are given out, but we do hope that you have your ticket and will join with us in the coming days for that big event.
[time=833] There is one premiere dinner, however, that is on December 8th, that has to do with our school, and certainly as Black Hawk Christian School grows, we need additional finances.
[time=844] In one of the ways we finance our school is through a premiere dinner of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=849] We are sure thankful for the Living Christmas Tree benefit dinner. It has helped support our school the past nine years, and each year it has grown.
[time=858] We're thrilled about this year because we're coming on this side of the street to see a new Christmas tree in our new church, rather, not the Convocation Center.
[time=866] And we're rapidly filling that up, but there will be places, please call right away at 493 7400 if you're interested in tickets for the premiere dinner concert.
[time=878] That is an exciting time, and tickets are still available for that event.
[time=883] Once again, that's Thursday evening, December 8th, and you can call Black Hawk Baptist Church at 493 7400 for tickets.
[time=892] Throughout the last several weeks, Rick has been preaching on specific sins and dilemmas that create conflict in the Christian life and create problems with families because of devastating sin, of drugs, of alcohol abuse.
[time=907] And we have a pamphlet for you entitled Victory Over Sin that can help you overcome some of these difficulties, whether your sin is very great or small.
[time=917] The same procedure takes place, and we'd like to invite you to write for this pamphlet today.
[time=922] And you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=933] Once again, the pamphlet is entitled Victory Over Sin, and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=945] And in the moment, we'll be going back to our regular service, and in the absence of our pastor, our youth pastor, Tim Teder will be speaking to us.
[time=953] Tim comes from nine years of experience in a church in Michigan, has been with us for about six months now,
[time=960] or delighted with his ministry with our youth and his overall acclimation to our program here.
[time=967] We're glad that he's here. We're looking forward to the message that he has for us.
[time=971] Let's go back to our live service right now.
[time=975] [MUSIC - 122 seconds]
[time=1101] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1105] [MUSIC]
[time=1107] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1109] [MUSIC]
[time=1111] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1113] Those of you who know me at all know that I'm not very musically inclined, and it's quite something to set behind them as they perform,
[time=1121] and they offer that beautiful music to the Lord, and to look at their music sheet and realize they haven't even got any words on there.
[time=1127] I don't know how they know where they are.
[time=1129] [LAUGHTER] But you know, our prayer is that through the memory, the emphasis on scripture memory through our church,
[time=1137] that each of us would spend enough time to be able to offer up God's word to him as praise in the same way as Dave and Debbie Johnson would offer up those beautiful musical notes in praise to the Lord also without looking at the words.
[time=1153] So let that be a challenge and an encouragement to you as we stand now to recite the memory verse for the month of November.
[time=1161] Psalm 27.1, "The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?
[time=1174] The Lord is the stronghold of my life, of whom shall I be afraid."
[time=1181] Psalm 27.1.
[time=1183] Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1185] It's our privilege today in Rick's absence to have our youth pastor come and share the word with us.
[time=1199] Since July, I have gotten to know how much Tim loves the Lord.
[time=1205] It's been obvious in his conversation, and when someone is filled with the Spirit of God and constantly in his word that comes out in his everyday conversation, that's been evident in Tim.
[time=1218] Also, it's been my privilege to hear him a couple times as he has shared in chapel with our high school students, and I am aware that he has great insight into the word.
[time=1230] He has been serving God for nine years and is equipped to come and share with us.
[time=1235] And I want you to welcome Tim as he comes to prepare us and prepare our hearts to learn what he has to share with us from the Lord.
[time=1242] Thank you, Tim, for coming.
[time=1250] Thank you, Steve.
[time=1256] One of my favorite cartoon characters is a character named Ziggy.
[time=1263] And Ziggy is perhaps one of the best examples of a person who is a nobody.
[time=1269] To everyone around him, Ziggy portrays someone who is insignificant and easily ignored.
[time=1277] And when we look into his make-believe life, we find ample evidence of his unimportant.
[time=1284] In one scene, we find Ziggy talking on the telephone.
[time=1288] Hello, mom, this is Ziggy, and comes back to reply, "Ziggy who?"
[time=1294] And in another instance, we see a U.S. Army recruiting office, and outside of the office is posted a demanding sign pointing out at every member of society saying,
[time=1303] "The U.S. Army wants to join you." And coming out of the recruitment office door is Ziggy.
[time=1310] And on his big, bald head stamped in bold letters is one word, reject.
[time=1317] You know, sometimes I feel like Ziggy.
[time=1323] Sometimes I feel like a reject.
[time=1327] When I compare my life to others who have achieved some level of fame or power or wealth or respect,
[time=1334] my life seems so unimportant, seems so insignificant.
[time=1340] Sometimes I feel like a nobody.
[time=1344] And perhaps some of you feel like nobody's too.
[time=1347] And if so, the passage we're going to look at this morning has special value to you because in it we learn the truth that God values the life of the nobodies of this world.
[time=1358] It's found in 1 Corinthians chapter 1.
[time=1362] 1 Corinthians chapter 1.
[time=1364] And what I'd like to do this morning is look at the last six verses of that chapter.
[time=1369] And try to draw out three of the main truths that I think that passage is trying to teach us.
[time=1374] And then from those three truths, try to take some principles that we can apply to the way that we think and the way that we live.
[time=1383] 1 Corinthians chapter 1 beginning with verse 26.
[time=1390] Paul writes, "Brothers, think of what you were when you were called.
[time=1395] Not many of you were wise by human standards.
[time=1399] Not many were influential.
[time=1401] Not many were of noble birth.
[time=1403] But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.
[time=1407] God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
[time=1411] He chose the lowly things of the world and the despised things and the things that are not to nullify the things that are so that no one may boast before him.
[time=1421] It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus who has become for us wisdom from God, that is our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
[time=1429] Therefore, as it is written, let him who boasts, boast in the Lord."
[time=1437] The first truth I think this passage is trying to teach us is this.
[time=1442] What the world values least, God chooses most.
[time=1448] Those people who in the world look at and evaluate by their standards and judge to be insignificant and of little worth, God tends to choose that kind of life the most to work out his purposes.
[time=1461] Now we see example after example of this in Scripture.
[time=1463] Let me just mention a few of them.
[time=1465] Moses was a fugitive and an outcast and working as a shepherd when God came to him and called him to be the leader to deliver his people out of Egypt.
[time=1477] Gideon was the least important family member in the weakest clan of the smallest tribe of Israel and yet God chose him to be the deliver of the nation.
[time=1487] When God sent Samuel to anoint a new king, David wasn't even present as a candidate.
[time=1494] In fact, Jesse and Samuel both thought that certainly God would choose one of the seven impressive older sons, but God chose David who was out tending the sheep.
[time=1506] Esther was a simple orphan girl whom God used to prevent the mass slaughter of the Jews.
[time=1511] And what did Jesus do when he came and had his ministry on earth?
[time=1516] Who were the people he chose?
[time=1519] Was it the leaders?
[time=1521] Was it those who had already demonstrated their significance by showing their great leadership potential or those who had accumulated wealth or those who were of noble birth?
[time=1530] Jesus went to the commoners and in some instances the despised in choosing those who would follow him and be his disciples.
[time=1538] What the world values least God chose is most.
[time=1543] We need to be careful that we don't overstate the fact because the passage does read that not many of you were wise, not many were influential, not many were of noble birth.
[time=1555] Be thankful that it doesn't say that none were wise, that none were influential, that none were of noble birth.
[time=1560] The fact is that God does choose some people of influence and we can be thankful for that.
[time=1565] We can be thankful that God called a man of wealth like Abraham, that he chose someone of noble birth like Solomon, that he called out someone of influence like Saul of Tarsus.
[time=1580] And even today God continues to use people of influence for his namesake certainly, but the fact remains that God most often uses people of insignificance to accomplish his work.
[time=1595] Why? Why does he do that?
[time=1598] Well as we go on in the passage I think we come to the second truth, and it is this, that God's work is best displayed in the lives of insignificant people.
[time=1609] God's work is best displayed in the lives of insignificant people.
[time=1614] In the passage it says that God chose the foolish things of the world, God chose the weak things of the world, he chose the lowly things and the despised things and the things that are not.
[time=1625] Insignificance doesn't draw attention to itself.
[time=1629] When God works in the life of a nobody, we're better able to see past the individual and to see the work and the power of God in their lives.
[time=1639] Now in this passage it tells us that God does this for a couple reasons.
[time=1643] First of all he does it to shame those who are wise and strong by the standards of the world.
[time=1651] God uses the nobodies to shame them and I believe that shame comes in two ways.
[time=1659] The wise and the noble of this world are shamed first of all when they realize the limits of their own abilities in this life.
[time=1667] Do you know that there's a group of this world's elite, geniuses, great artists, significant leaders who have committed themselves to propagating a civilization of the highest standard?
[time=1681] They hope to accomplish this to the use of sperm banks, selective breeding techniques because they're convinced that if we can fill the world with more intelligent, more creativity, more natural leadership,
[time=1696] then we can solve most of the world's problems.
[time=1700] I want you to know it won't work.
[time=1704] It won't work because our problem doesn't stem from a lack of leadership or creativity.
[time=1712] Our problems stem from a lack of God.
[time=1716] And proud people are put to shame when they see in the life of seemingly insignificant people something accomplished that only God can accomplish.
[time=1727] When there's peace, when there's joy, when there's love, when there's a purpose for life, all their effort can't bring that.
[time=1740] But God's spirit can, God's power can, and they're put to shame. And I believe they'll be put to shame in the future when one day they stand before the judgment of God.
[time=1750] And at that moment they'll realize that all their effort, all their ability, all their prestige means nothing to God.
[time=1760] And they'll look around at those whom they thought were insignificant in this world, and those will be the ones who receive the favor of God, who receive the acceptance of God.
[time=1769] They'll receive eternal life when they themselves will be shamed and receive God's judgment.
[time=1777] Another reason God chooses the insignificant by the world's standards and best displays his work through them because this passage says that by doing that he nullifies the things that are.
[time=1789] In verse 28, God uses three phrases to describe the nobodies of this world.
[time=1795] First of all, he calls them the lowly things.
[time=1799] Then he refers to them as the despised things, and then the things that are not.
[time=1805] Now by the lowly things, Paul is referring to those people to whom we hold no respect.
[time=1814] And by the despised things, he's speaking to those people on a little lower level, those people for whom we hold disrespect.
[time=1822] But then he uses a phrase that is actually an insult in the Jewish language.
[time=1827] He says the things that are not. That's a phrase that the Jewish people used to refer to the Gentiles in their eyes, the lowest class of people.
[time=1835] These are the people that we hold nothing at all.
[time=1842] They're worthless. They're not even worthy of our attention. They are the absolute super nobodies of the world.
[time=1849] And these are the very people, Scripture says, that God chooses to accomplish his work most often.
[time=1856] And what does he do? By choosing the insignificant, he nullifies the things that are.
[time=1861] And Paul's used to that term the things that are. He's referring to the somebodies of the world.
[time=1865] Those people that by the world's standards have achieved something of importance.
[time=1871] And by choosing the insignificant, God nullifies that which the world says has real value to nullify.
[time=1881] If I were to approach you after the service this morning, imagine that I took my checkbook out and wrote you a personal check for $1,000.
[time=1890] Now this will only happen in your imagination, so don't get your hopes up.
[time=1894] But suppose I wrote you a personal check for $1,000, assuming that I had at least $1,000 in the bank, that check then becomes valuable.
[time=1900] It has worth. It has a value of $1,000. But suppose before handing that to you, I took the check back and across the face of it,
[time=1908] I wrote in big black bold letters, V-O-I-D, underline, void.
[time=1915] That piece of paper no longer has value. It's been voided. It's been nullified.
[time=1920] The value's been stripped away from it. And that's what the Scripture is saying.
[time=1924] God does by choosing those who by the world's view in the world's eyes have little significance when God reaches down and chooses those people and uses their lives.
[time=1933] He is in essence writing void across the value system of the world and saying what you say is of great worth and of great value and the people that you say are significant.
[time=1943] That has no real value. That has no real value.
[time=1949] God's work is best displayed in the lives of insignificant people.
[time=1954] God shows the lowly and the despised and the things that are not to take away the value of the things that are.
[time=1960] In other words, God gives value to the nobodies to show the somebody's how worthless their own abilities and achievements really are.
[time=1969] And God wants people to see that He chooses according to His grace, not according to the merit of the people.
[time=1979] I think the last truth that I see in this passage is that the credit for our salvation belongs to God alone.
[time=1990] I can claim no credit for God's work of salvation in my life belongs to Him alone.
[time=1998] A familiar passage to a Ephesians 2, 8, and 9 teaches us that it is by grace that we have been saved and it's not of ourselves, it's through faith.
[time=2012] And that even this faith is a gift from God. It's not by our own work so that we have no right to boast before God.
[time=2020] Jeremiah 9, 23 and 24, this is what the Lord says, "Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boasts boast about this, that he understands and knows me.
[time=2039] That I am the Lord who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth. For in these I delight."
[time=2049] Three truths, what the world values least God chooses most.
[time=2054] God's work is best displayed in the lives of insignificant people and the credit for our salvation belongs to God alone.
[time=2065] Now if these three things are true, what are some principles that we can draw out of these to apply to the ways that we live and think in our Christian lives?
[time=2077] You may have already thought of some of your own. Let me suggest some to you.
[time=2083] One principle I think we can take from this passage is this.
[time=2090] God's measure of worth needs to be my measure of worth.
[time=2097] The way God measures things needs to be the way that I measure things as well.
[time=2104] How do I go about measuring the worth of others, the value of others?
[time=2109] You know what I find in my own life? I find that many times I go about measuring the value of people the same way the world does.
[time=2118] I sit down in front of the television, I watch Robin Leach on the lifestyles of the rich and famous, and I see these houses,
[time=2125] and I see the popularity and influence and the wealth, and I say, "Boy, now there's someone that's really somebody."
[time=2136] Boy, if I could have that, if I could be like that, those people are worthy of my respect.
[time=2142] I walk past the newsstands and I see the magazines and the tabloids with the faces of celebrities plastered all over the front,
[time=2149] and I think, "Boy, there's somebody that's really someone." And when I meet people, how do I judge their worth and value?
[time=2156] So often it's by appearance, by looks, by what I might know about their influence on other people, their background.
[time=2167] I remember when I was in junior high school, I attended a church down in Florida, it was a large church.
[time=2174] And in one particular week, they had scheduled an evangelist to come in and speak.
[time=2179] Now this was someone that was well known. He'd written books, he was on television, and I was excited about his coming.
[time=2186] I hope I might have an opportunity to meet him.
[time=2189] Well, on the first day of his arrival, I happened to be in the church office when the phone rang.
[time=2194] Since no one else is there, I answered it.
[time=2197] And it was a long-distance phone call for this evangelist.
[time=2200] I took down the message, hung up the phone, folded the piece of paper, and walked out of the office with a sense of excitement
[time=2208] because I had an excuse to go and meet him.
[time=2211] And some of you know what it's like to meet someone of importance.
[time=2214] There's a little bit of nervousness about it, a little bit of fear, a little bit of excitement. That's how I felt.
[time=2219] I finally found him in the auditorium of the church, and he was walking down the aisles meeting some of the people who were seated there.
[time=2227] Here I was, boy in seventh grade, walking up with a piece of paper in my hand, and I stood there to wait until he was finished talking with the people there.
[time=2236] He finished talking with them and went on to speak with someone else, and I thought, "Well, perhaps he hasn't noticed me."
[time=2244] So I moved around to the other side and stood so I was sure he saw me and stood there and waited until he was done, and he was done.
[time=2252] And he pushed past me to talk to someone else.
[time=2257] Well, I finally gained the courage to actually speak up and said, "Excuse me, but a little bit of pride."
[time=2263] I happened to be in the office, and this long-distance phone call came for you, and I took the message, handed it to him.
[time=2271] And without a word or even looking at the message, he turned around to greet someone else.
[time=2277] I watched him during the rest of that week, and I noticed other qualities about him that didn't fit my preconceived notion of what greatness might be.
[time=2289] I have to tell you that in the next year or two of hearing of this man's ministry in his life, certain things came out in his life that showed that although I may have measured his value by one set of standard,
[time=2304] the real qualities in his life gave evidence that at least at that time he was not being true to his commitment and following of Jesus Christ.
[time=2314] And that was just one instance in my life where I began to realize that the way I value people and evaluate people is not always consistent with what God says is most important.
[time=2327] What did God say to Samuel? He said, "Man looks on the outward. I look at the heart."
[time=2333] And I need to be careful that I measure the worth of people in the same way that God measures their worth.
[time=2339] And not only measuring the worth of other people, but measuring the worth of myself.
[time=2343] How do I determine how worthwhile I am?
[time=2346] Is it because I've achieved a certain goal?
[time=2350] Is it because I've attained a certain amount of wealth?
[time=2353] Is it because I was born in a certain kind of family that live in a certain kind of home, have certain abilities?
[time=2358] I look a certain way. If those are the measure of my worth, I'm going to be disappointed.
[time=2364] That's not the measure of my worth.
[time=2367] I am valuable not because of what I possess, but because of what God, the creator of all things, has chosen to do in my life.
[time=2375] Sending Jesus Christ for me and choosing me to do his work through me.
[time=2385] God's measure of worth needs to be my measure of worth.
[time=2388] Another principle we can get from this passage is that I should not be prejudiced in my evangelism.
[time=2397] I need to be careful that I don't go after the big shots as I share the gospel of Jesus Christ with other people.
[time=2403] We have a tendency to do this, don't we?
[time=2406] How often do we get excited about the celebrity that comes to Christ?
[time=2411] We hear about the decision they've made for Jesus Christ.
[time=2414] The movie star, the musician, the sports celebrity.
[time=2420] When they make some profession of Christ, we get excited about that.
[time=2426] If in this service two individuals came forward, one of known respect in the community and the other, someone who is obviously lacking in material things of this world, perhaps uneducated.
[time=2441] Both desiring to make profession of faith in Jesus Christ, for which individual would we be most excited?
[time=2449] You know what the scripture says, it says that the angels in heaven rejoice when one sinner repents.
[time=2455] One sinner, that's how it classifies people. Not when one wealthy person, not when one influential person, not when one noble person, not when one strong person repents when one sinner repents.
[time=2466] And I need to be careful when I share the gospel with other people that I don't get the idea that I've got to share Jesus Christ with the best, because if the best will accept Him, then others will follow.
[time=2476] And I've heard that kind of strategy in evangelism before, and it bothers me a little bit.
[time=2482] I understand the intent.
[time=2484] But when we say that we're going to move on to a school campus, or that we're going to move into a community, and the focus of our evangelism is going to be those people who have the most influence.
[time=2496] Because if we can just win them, then others will follow. I think we're going smack dab against the kind of evangelism that even Jesus demonstrated when He was on earth.
[time=2507] Because so often we find that when we approach the celebrity and we share Jesus Christ with them, and they make that confession of Jesus Christ, and many times when people do follow, who are they following?
[time=2517] Many times it's not Christ. Many times it's in fact the celebrity. What did God do? What did Jesus do? Went to the nobodies. He went to the nobodies.
[time=2531] And we need to be careful. We don't get that celebrity idea that in sharing Jesus Christ that we go for the big guns.
[time=2537] You know, I think Jesus realized that those who have the most are often those who are least likely to come to Him.
[time=2548] You remember the story of a young man in Matthew chapter 19 who had a lot of money and came to Jesus.
[time=2556] And he came to Jesus and he asked this question, "Jesus, what do I have to do to have eternal life?" Now put that in a modern context. Someone of great wealth in our community comes forward in the church and asks the question, "I want to know what I need to do to have eternal life.
[time=2571] What goes through our minds? Oh, well, praise the Lord." Now here is really somebody that can be used in the kingdom of God.
[time=2579] Here's somebody that has the resources to use, can be used in the ministry of our church.
[time=2586] And probably, you know, many of us would be apt to have that person on their knees reciting some prayer after us to usher them into the kingdom.
[time=2595] What did Jesus do? The rich young man asked, "Jesus, what do I need to do to have eternal life?"
[time=2601] Jesus looked at him and said, "In essence, you need to follow God with your whole heart." The man said, "I've obeyed all the commands." Jesus looking to the heart of the man said, "There's one thing you still lack.
[time=2611] There's one thing you're still missing." Jesus said, "You go, take all that you possess, sell it, give the money to the poor, and then you can come and be my disciple."
[time=2622] And Scripture tells us that the man turned and walked away sorrowful because that was something he was not willing to do.
[time=2630] And the astounding thing is that Jesus let him go.
[time=2634] And as he walked away, Jesus said to his disciples, "It is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle."
[time=2645] Jesus realized that for those people of significance, it is difficult to fully surrender to Jesus Christ.
[time=2656] Because people of significance find it hard to come to a point of saying that I have nothing in myself that deserves God.
[time=2666] And I must come with an attitude of being willing to give up everything to follow the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2671] That's harder for people that have a lot. That's harder for people of significance.
[time=2678] We can be thankful that Jesus went on to say that what's impossible with man is possible with God.
[time=2687] But the fact remains I need to be careful that I'm not prejudiced in the way I go about my evangelism and sharing the gospel with other people.
[time=2695] Another principle is this, "My weaknesses provide the best showcase for God's work.
[time=2703] Second Corinthians 4-7, but we have this treasure that is the power of Jesus Christ in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from God and not from us."
[time=2720] And how does God describe us in that passage?
[time=2723] Pots of clay.
[time=2729] Why? Why does God put His treasure, the power of Jesus Christ and jars of clay to make sure that the container doesn't distract from the contents?
[time=2745] See if I'm insignificant, I don't draw attention to myself.
[time=2749] People can see the work and the power of God in my life and aren't distracted by who I am or what I am.
[time=2758] My weaknesses provide the best showcase for the work of God.
[time=2761] It was Paul who had what he called the thorn in the flesh and we're not sure exactly what that thorn was.
[time=2767] But apparently it was something that by human standard would be considered a weakness.
[time=2772] And Paul asked God over and over, "God, please take this away from me."
[time=2779] This was God's answer, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."
[time=2786] Therefore Paul said, "I will boast all the more gladly about my weakness so that Christ's power may rest in me."
[time=2798] It's my weaknesses that can be the showcase for God's work.
[time=2802] That's not an excuse for failure.
[time=2805] That doesn't mean that we go out and we find the least qualified people to do the work so we make sure God gets the credit.
[time=2812] It doesn't mean that we try to be ill-prepared or that we try to be weak or that we try to fail so that God gets the credit.
[time=2823] It doesn't mean that in preparing for this message that I did as little preparation as possible because in fact I didn't.
[time=2833] In fact I stood in this auditorium last night, late last evening, and I looked out on the empty pews and I imagined the people that would be sitting here.
[time=2845] And I thought about the people that would be watching by way of television.
[time=2851] And I thought, "Who am I to really do this?" And I had to tell you, I was and am overwhelmed.
[time=2863] I think of my weaknesses, I think of my failures, I think of my inadequacies.
[time=2870] For that matter to stand before ten people and to proclaim the Word of God, and I think, "Who am I to do that?"
[time=2877] But you know something? When I stand face to face with my inadequacies, I don't despair, I don't lose hope, I don't become discouraged, I don't give up.
[time=2891] Because I realize that those very weaknesses, those very inadequacies are the showcase for God's power and God's work.
[time=2906] Don't let anyone tell you that because of some weakness or failure in your life, you now have to accept his second God's second best.
[time=2919] You may have gone through some significant physical, emotional, or spiritual failures in your life.
[time=2927] And you may have the scars of those.
[time=2930] You may carry those significant scars with you for the rest of your life. I don't try to belittle that fact.
[time=2938] But don't let anyone try to tell you that because of those failures, because of your weaknesses, that now you're delegated to some second-class place,
[time=2946] that now you've got to accept God's second best in your life because that just isn't true.
[time=2952] You see, it can be at the very point of your greatest failure. In fact, your greatest sin that God can move in and do his greatest work.
[time=2963] I believe that because it's given over and over in Scripture. That's exactly what God did.
[time=2970] And I find people so many times who are so discouraged when I say, "Boy, I have blown it so bad.
[time=2975] I have messed up so royally that now God's just not going to be able to use me in any significant way. That's not true.
[time=2982] God can still do his very best work in your life because see God glories in using the weakness and the failure and the sins to display his power.
[time=2991] That's not an excuse to fail. It's not an excuse to sin, but it is a hope for those of us who are weak, for those of us who are insignificant,
[time=2999] for those of us who are the nobodies to know that God will use exactly those things we consider our greatest weaknesses to be the best showcase for his power.
[time=3011] Another principle is this. If God has called and chosen me, I don't need man's approval.
[time=3023] I've worked for 10 years with junior and senior high students. And I know the pressures that they face and wanting to fit in with peers and wanting to be accepted by peers.
[time=3038] And I know not only the pressures that they face, I know the pressures that I face in that regard too, because I want to be liked. I want to be accepted.
[time=3048] I want people to look up to me in some ways. I want that.
[time=3054] But I want to tell you something. When we're motivated by that desire, it can lead us into so many downfalls.
[time=3061] And I'm sure that even in the congregation here are the people listening by way of television, there are those who have given themselves to drug abuse, to alcohol, to sexual immorality,
[time=3073] to making choices that you know are wrong simply to go along with the crowd and to fit in and to be acceptable by people's standards.
[time=3082] And you're caught up in that.
[time=3086] I want you to know something, and this is not an easy answer, but it is the answer.
[time=3092] That if you have Jesus Christ, you have God's approval. And that is enough. That is enough.
[time=3105] And I know telling that to a student who is so concerned about what their classmates think about them.
[time=3112] I know that that's not an easy thing always to hear. I know it's not easy to stand in the midst of the group and to say I'm going to be different,
[time=3119] knowing that that may mean that you are not accepted or you are not approved of.
[time=3123] But I want you to know that if God approves of you, it doesn't matter whether they approve of you or not.
[time=3128] If you have Jesus Christ, you have enough.
[time=3133] And I need to be concerned with whether or not God approves of me, and not whether man approves of me.
[time=3140] In fact, Paul said if I begin to start trying to live in a way that I gain man's approval, at that moment I cease in serving God.
[time=3151] Another principle is I need to give credit where credit is due.
[time=3159] In the passage we read that it is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus.
[time=3163] Therefore let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.
[time=3169] I need to give credit where credit is due.
[time=3172] I need to let people know if there is a difference in my life, where does that difference come from?
[time=3180] There is a kind of evangelism that is sometimes referred to as lifestyle evangelism.
[time=3186] And I believe in lifestyle evangelism. I believe in the kind of evangelism that goes out and lives Jesus Christ in the middle of people.
[time=3195] And doesn't just hop from one person to the next, spitting off three principles or four steps in knowing Jesus and goes on to the next.
[time=3203] I believe in living Jesus in front of people.
[time=3206] But you know something, there is an element of lifestyle evangelism that is so distorted, that is so watered down, that it teaches us this.
[time=3215] It teaches us that all that is required of me to be an effective witness to others is to simply live a good life in front of others.
[time=3223] And somehow by seeing my good life they are going to become a Christian.
[time=3230] Well obviously that is not enough.
[time=3232] If I live a good life, a different life in front of people they are going to look at me and they are going to say,
[time=3238] "Why, look at Tim Teder." There is something different about him.
[time=3243] I can't quite put my finger on it, but there is something that I admire about him.
[time=3249] And they admire me. They appreciate me.
[time=3255] And they never know why there is a difference in my life.
[time=3259] Effective lifestyle evangelism means that I not only live Jesus Christ in front of them, but I tell them why there is a difference in my life.
[time=3266] Yes, sometimes I brag about Jesus. They need to know.
[time=3271] They need to know why I am what I am.
[time=3276] They need to know who the credit should be attributed to.
[time=3280] That it is not my own effort, but it is the effort and the work of Jesus Christ in my life.
[time=3286] And I need to make sure that I speak that. I need to make sure that I say that.
[time=3294] Let me mention one other principle from this passage.
[time=3302] If the credit for my salvation belongs to God alone, then I must never think that I deserve God's favor.
[time=3312] I can never think I deserve that.
[time=3315] Take the wisest person alive today.
[time=3320] Take the strongest person.
[time=3324] Take the richest, the most respected, the most noble.
[time=3331] None of them deserves God's favor.
[time=3337] You don't deserve God's favor.
[time=3341] I don't deserve God's favor. None of us deserve it at all.
[time=3351] You know what we do deserve?
[time=3355] We deserve the full wrath of God's eternal judgment.
[time=3360] That's what we deserve.
[time=3363] And it's at that very point so many times the people of significance joke because they say,
[time=3371] "But do you know who I am?
[time=3375] Do you know what I possess?
[time=3378] Do you know what influence I've had in this world?
[time=3383] Do you know how good I've been?
[time=3386] I deserve it. I deserve at least some of the credit for my salvation.
[time=3393] We deserve nothing.
[time=3396] The work of God in our life is to his credit alone.
[time=3400] I deserve nothing of that.
[time=3403] See, we have nothing to offer him.
[time=3407] But he offered to us Jesus Christ.
[time=3411] And here in this passage it tells us that Jesus Christ is for us our wisdom.
[time=3419] Here is the standard Jesus Christ comes to us and he is for us our righteousness.
[time=3426] That I can stand right before God.
[time=3428] I can stand clean.
[time=3429] I can stand pure.
[time=3430] I can stand forgiven.
[time=3432] He is my holiness.
[time=3434] He makes me pure.
[time=3436] He works in my life now to be becoming everything he wants me to be.
[time=3443] And he is my redemption.
[time=3446] When I deserved nothing Jesus came down and bought me back.
[time=3451] He paid the price on the cross to win me back and to purchase me.
[time=3456] To bring me into the kingdom and the family of God.
[time=3459] Is that to my credit?
[time=3461] No, to the credit of God.
[time=3469] We have nothing to offer him.
[time=3472] It is what he offers us.
[time=3475] There is a familiar chorus that speaks to the truth that we have talked about today.
[time=3482] Perhaps you have heard it.
[time=3485] Something beautiful, something good.
[time=3489] All my confusion, he understood.
[time=3493] All I had to offer him was brokenness and strife.
[time=3499] But he made something beautiful out of my life.
