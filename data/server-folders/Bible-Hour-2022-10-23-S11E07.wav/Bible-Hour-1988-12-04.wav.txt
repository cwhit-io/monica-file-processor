[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=30] (crickets chirping)
[time=90] (crickets chirping) As individuals, we are feeling the pain
[time=117] of our sexually-permissive society.
[time=120] No one expressed it better than Carol King nearly 20 years ago when she sang, "Tonight, you're mine so completely.
[time=130] You give your love so sweetly.
[time=134] But will you still love me tomorrow?"
[time=148] [MUSIC]
[time=295] [MUSIC - 203 seconds]
[time=507] The world is hushed and still. Only the silent stars keep watch as the promise is fulfilled. Just as a child newly born, he shall come to a stable, rough with sod. 'Tis gentle Jesus, Prince of Peace, the Blessed Son of God. We await him with reverent hearts. O come, Lord Jesus, come.'
[time=531] [MUSIC - 531 seconds]
[time=1070] Welcome today to the Bible Hour. We're delighted that you've joined us today for this hour. That is our morning worship service, but our opportunity to share the Lord Jesus Christ with you. Peter, the Lord Jesus Christ with you.
[time=1081] Pete, how are you and your family? Well, we're doing fine, Rick. As you know, we're into the heavy part of our musical season with the Living Christmas Tree and anticipation of the 10 concerts that we're doing right, beginning right now.
[time=1094] Well, I'm glad to hear your fine on the day when the tree actually is erected and constructed right here in our new sanctuary.
[time=1101] We have a lot of helpers, Rick. A lot of volunteers that come and really take the ministry of the Living Christmas Tree, not only the singing, but the construction and the babysitting world.
[time=1110] And the babysitting and all that goes into it, and we're deeply indebted to all of those people that help behind the scenes to make it more convenient for us.
[time=1118] A guesstimation. How many people would that be? Well, last year we sent out 420 invitations to the appreciation dinner that we give in January after the tree, so good 400 people get involved.
[time=1130] Wow, that is amazing. You've heard us talk about the Living Christmas Tree, and we know that many, many of you have tickets, and we're looking forward to seeing you.
[time=1139] We must unfortunately share with those of you who do not have tickets that they have been distributed, distributed. Is that the word I'm fishing for?
[time=1147] And they're gone. That's the easy way to put it. We don't have any more. We regret that we can't even put you on a waiting list because it is so long.
[time=1155] But to those of you who do have tickets, we're looking forward to that day. The title of the musical this year.
[time=1161] Rick, we're titling it, "Beautiful Savior." Most of the concert this year is just that. It's a musical concert. Many times we have background sets along with the tree and some drama and things.
[time=1174] But this year it's just music that really depicts the beauty of our Lord and the thankfulness and praise that we have in our hearts because He did come as our Savior.
[time=1184] Well, we can share with you that the next two Bible Hour telecasts will be music from the Living Christmas Tree. So if you can't join us in person, you can come to those concerts.
[time=1195] Today we have a booklet to share with you that goes hand in hand with our Bible study today. It has the clear title, "Moral Purity."
[time=1204] "Moral Purity" is the greatest need that you will experience in your personal life because God has designed us in a way that when we break moral purity, we sin, as Paul said, in a way like no other sin.
[time=1220] It's a sin that takes place within our own body. The consequences are grave. And we want to share this booklet with you as a preventative tool.
[time=1229] But then also as a corrective tool, a way of recovery for those of you who have already compromised in this area. If you have, you already know the pain, the guilt, the shame, the feelings of being used, and this booklet will help to restore you.
[time=1244] So we'd like to send you a copy if you'll write for it. It's a gift from us to you.
[time=1249] We hope that you'll write for your copy today and you may write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Again, the address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1269] Thank you, Pete. And again, the booklet is designed as preventative medicine, some insights to live by. And so we hope you will write and request the copy, and we'll give you the address again at the end of today's broadcast.
[time=1283] We're looking forward to the Living Christmas Tree, and before long, we'll be already into a new year. And we want to thank you, friends, who have financially supported the Bible Hour during this past year.
[time=1295] It's because of gifts of friends like you that this ministry is able to reach out in a broad way here in Indiana, across the line in Ohio, and even on one station in California.
[time=1305] As we come to this year end, we know that many of you are considering financially supporting the Lord's work somewhere, and we thank you for considering the Bible Hour.
[time=1314] We want to invite those of you who are in the Fort Wayne area to our Christmas Eve service. If you're not church going, or if you don't have a church home that has a Christmas Eve service, we'd like to invite you to join us for ours.
[time=1328] Pete, give us the date and the time. Rick, we'll be having a service on December 24th at Saturday evening, and this will be a candle-like communion service with some caroling and a real time of just reverently worshiping the Lord before we join with family and friends in great celebration the next day.
[time=1347] And that's at six o'clock in the evening. We hope you'll join us in person. We'd love to meet you and to share the anticipation of Christmas together.
[time=1356] Thank you for joining us here today on the Bible Hour.
[time=1386] We're to the mountain's breathless view.
[time=1391] If the crowds applaud my progress, they never know my name.
[time=1403] I will fall, just to say, if it leads me to the desert, where your voice seems far away, I will still believe you love me.
[time=1431] I will listen, and I will pray, though the thousands throng around me.
[time=1442] If I am the critics' chance, I will need you all.
[time=1453] You're still small boys, but I want to be your servant, though I don't always know how.
[time=1470] I will still believe you love me.
[time=1475] I will listen, and I will pray, so be with me in each moment, day by day, and wake by you.
[time=1493] And I will follow you, wherever you are.
[time=1542] Hello, my friends, explain, and I'm here today to tell you about how knowing Jesus Christ personally has changed my life.
[time=1566] I was raised by godly parents, taken to church as a young person, but when I grew up, I got away from that, and I lived my life the way I wanted to live it.
[time=1578] Life went on like this for many years.
[time=1582] I had a home, a husband, a job, three children.
[time=1586] In fact, I had worked at the same job for 18 years, and I thought that's how I would live my life.
[time=1592] But things began to change, and the things that I had put my trust in were not there for me.
[time=1598] The people that I was trusting in were not there for me anymore either, and life became difficult.
[time=1606] I was seeing a psychologist and a marriage counselor.
[time=1612] I was seeing a medical doctor every week just to gain some courage, some reason for living.
[time=1618] One particular day stands out in my mind, the doctor suggested that I go into the hospital.
[time=1625] I had lost so much weight that it was endangering my health.
[time=1629] I could not sleep at night, I could not eat, but I couldn't face that either, not that day.
[time=1635] I remember walking out of his office and wondering where I would get the help that I needed.
[time=1642] Well, that day I drove by a church near my home, and I remembered as a child hearing that God cares about us.
[time=1650] He cares what happens to us.
[time=1652] So that day I sought the help of this church near my home, and there was a young man there that was willing to talk to me.
[time=1660] He told me, first of all I told in my whole life story, he knew nothing about me at all, and he listened very patiently.
[time=1670] And he said, Fran, I don't have any answers for the problems in your marriage, but I do have some answers for your life.
[time=1677] He says I know someone that can help you as a person, and he told me about Jesus Christ.
[time=1683] He told me that Jesus loved me enough to die for me, and he quoted Romans 5-8 to me.
[time=1689] But God demonstrates his love to us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[time=1696] That verse of scripture impacted my life. You see, I needed that kind of love. I needed someone that would love me forever.
[time=1704] And that day Jesus Christ came into my life, and he changed me.
[time=1710] With him came the reassurance that I really was all right.
[time=1714] For you see, it's like Tim said last Sunday, "I felt like a super nobody, yet Jesus loved me enough to die for me."
[time=1722] So I realized that I did have worth and value to God, and I adopted that for myself.
[time=1728] I realized that if God loved me, I must have worth and value as a person.
[time=1734] And then that day I realized also that God forgave all of my sin.
[time=1740] Everything that I had ever done and everything that I ever would do.
[time=1745] He forgave that, and he came into my life with power.
[time=1750] In fact, he says in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, he says, "Fran, don't you know that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwells in you?"
[time=1762] It's no wonder there were immediate changes in my life. I lost some of my old habits. I lost interest in them.
[time=1770] And also, I became interested in God in finding out who he is. He gave me a hunger for his word that had never been there before.
[time=1781] Now, I don't mean to imply that all of my troubles were over, for they certainly were not.
[time=1785] Two and a half years later, I had to face that divorce situation, which I did not want to face.
[time=1791] But God gave me the courage to go through that. And right in the middle of all of that trouble, he gave me a life's versus scripture.
[time=1799] He said, "Fran, seek me first, my kingdom, and my righteousness.
[time=1805] And all of the things that you need to live your life, I will take care of those things." Now, he didn't promise me well nor riches, and I don't have those things, but I do have a good life.
[time=1821] Thank you, Fran. I hope from life to life you can discover that Jesus Christ is one who can come into your heart
[time=1831] and never change the circumstances on the outside, but make you a new person on the inside,
[time=1837] and able to live victoriously in spite of what's on the outside.
[time=1842] Our God, we thank you today that you change lives. Thank you for Fran's testimony because it's hers,
[time=1849] but also because it can be ours. It can be the testimony of each who would give their life to Christ.
[time=1855] May there be those this morning who discover that they can have new life in Christ.
[time=1860] May they find in this very hour there's a purpose and a reason for living in Jesus.
[time=1866] For it's in his name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1871] Before we study the scriptures this morning, I want to give you just a brief update on a number of things here in the life
[time=1878] of our church at Blackhawk. We're still finishing up many of the details of this building.
[time=1884] You may have noticed that the stair tower to the west now has carpet.
[time=1889] The stair tower to the east has the promise of carpet. It's about half done.
[time=1894] We have new lights that will light up the entrance as you come in off of State Street
[time=1900] and an additional large overhead light is going to be put there by I&M at our expense,
[time=1907] but it will really light up the intersection to help with both pedestrian and car traffic during the evening services.
[time=1915] We are hoping to be able to provide a second exit out of our parking lot.
[time=1921] I don't know whether you're a detailed person. I'm usually not a detailed person, but after being stranded in the parking lot a few times I took my running watch and I set the timer and two weeks ago today it took me 20 minutes to get out of the parking lot.
[time=1937] I will not tell you what verses of scripture were needed to revive my spiritual life,
[time=1944] but some about patience came to mind and I realized what a frustration that is.
[time=1950] We have gotten permission this past week from the county fathers to put a second exit out of our parking lot on the State Street.
[time=1959] It will come directly opposite Belshire Way.
[time=1963] If you're not sure where Belshire Way is, it will come between the farmhouse that we do not own
[time=1970] and our athletic fields just to the east of our existing exit by about 300 yards.
[time=1978] It looks like it's a long drive for a big golf or so I'll say 300 yards.
[time=1983] We also will be able to in that direction where the exit is add probably about another 100 parking spaces
[time=1991] with additional stone parking, but all of that will cost about $17,000 to $18,000 to put that in.
[time=2000] Then in the future too we hope to go directly behind the building to the east.
[time=2005] There is an area that remains undeveloped.
[time=2009] It is an area where we could expand parking with more stone parking until we're able to afford putting asphalt in.
[time=2017] We have some new lights on the back of the building so that our choir members will not fall into the potholes
[time=2023] which are now somewhere between three and a half and four feet deep.
[time=2028] As a part of putting in a new exit, we will be re-stoning all of the parking areas to fill that in.
[time=2035] So help is on the way. Thank you for your patience.
[time=2038] But as we think of that help that's on the way, forgive me for being so blunt today, every change that we make costs a great deal of money.
[time=2047] When you provide parking for a hundred people, it costs you a number that you can look at and say,
[time=2053] "Oh, I can relate to that number." When you start parking cars for 2,000 people you say, "What do you mean it costs $45,000 to asphalt the stones?" It costs $45,000. That's why it is stone.
[time=2067] But we simply need to say as a church family, God has blessed us.
[time=2071] We're thankful for that, but to whom much is given, much is required.
[time=2076] So we've written to you as a family. I don't like to speak about money, but we just need you to know those opportunities also come in the form of responsibility.
[time=2085] So we've asked you to give to our regular budget, not to a special project, because we didn't want to raise money for a special project, see our regular budget go down.
[time=2094] So we've combined that. As we come to year end, there's a challenge before us to be able to provide for the future.
[time=2102] In providing for the future, there's a major change coming to our structure on Sunday mornings on January the 15th.
[time=2110] On January the 15th, we will be reorganizing our Sunday morning format, returning to two morning worship services.
[time=2119] The first service will be at 9.15. In the old days, it was at 9.30.
[time=2124] But it's 15 minutes earlier, and then the second one will be at 10.50.
[time=2129] We'll use the extra time, that 15 minutes to transition from service to service.
[time=2135] As much as possible, we will reduplicate the Sunday school schedule from the pastures when we've had two services.
[time=2143] We'll send you out mailings and information, but we wanted you to know that with the parking and the lighting and the crowded situations, help is on its way. Thanks for your patience.
[time=2153] Do you have a Bible today? Let's study God's Word together.
[time=2156] Open your Bibles, please, to the Book of Genesis.
[time=2159] Genesis, that first Book of the Bible, gives to us beginnings, origins, and Genesis chapter 2.
[time=2166] Rather than me read the passage at one setting today, I'll highlight verses as we go along.
[time=2173] Genesis chapter 2 will be the home base for our study today.
[time=2180] Our topic this morning is this, "What the Bible Says About Sex." Now, I need to be careful because that will be very discomforting to many of you to hear a topic, "What the Bible Says About Sex." This morning, Kathy said to me as we're getting ready to come, "What are you speaking on today?" And I said, "What the Bible Says About Sex?" With unusual interest in my morning message, she said, "What are you going to say?"
[time=2209] I assured her today that I would embarrass neither of us.
[time=2213] She breathed a great sigh of relief, but you may be sitting there saying, "What is he going to say today?" My children are here. I've invited friends here today, or my grandmother's here.
[time=2225] What is he going to say?
[time=2228] There are those topics that strike us with great fear.
[time=2231] Donald Joy, a great researcher on human sexuality from a Christian perspective, said one time he was speaking in Toronto, he had leveled.
[time=2240] He had spoken straight to a group of elementary school boys, fathers, and grandfathers.
[time=2248] Then with nervous anticipation, he said, "Are there any questions?" And a gray-haired grandfather stood up, and he said in my heart, I said, "Oh, no.
[time=2257] He is going to zap me now." And the grandfather looked him right in the eye and said, "Where were you when I was 15?"
[time=2266] I won't embarrass you today. At least that won't be my purpose.
[time=2270] But sometimes we avoid subjects when in reality there's a deep hunger in our hearts to know.
[time=2275] What is it that God would say, and need not only to know in the middle of life, but there are issues of life that we think someday I will tell these issues to my children,
[time=2286] and by the time we tell them to our children, they chuckle on the inside, because they dealt with it for the past ten years.
[time=2294] I can remember my own life when my parents finally came to me with this issue of human sexuality
[time=2300] that they were about seven years behind the times.
[time=2305] And so this morning we were going to speak with relevance, but we also want to speak with sensitivity.
[time=2311] What would God say about human sexuality? What was his plan?
[time=2315] What preparation is there? What is the process that he would have for our lives in this critical area?
[time=2321] We live in a time that can be described even by the secular mind, not the religious thinker, as a time of great sexual permissiveness.
[time=2332] It has been around for at least twenty years.
[time=2336] The sexual revolution came in many ways as an extension of the counterculture of the '60s,
[time=2343] and so a whole generation of young people began to explore.
[time=2347] They explored with government, they explored with drugs, they explored with their own body sexually.
[time=2353] Many of those who would lead the charge were not the philosophers as much as they were the musicians.
[time=2360] I can remember in 1963 the Beatles came on the scene and they had some long hair, not nearly as long as most of you have today,
[time=2369] but in those days it was long hair, and they sang songs that were this explicit sexually.
[time=2376] I want to hold your hand. I mean, that's really getting intimate, but that was music in 1963.
[time=2384] But when you came to the late '60s, you came to new explorations of what would they say about sexuality.
[time=2391] Tommy James and the Chondels wrote a song. They must have spent days, maybe months writing the lyrics of these words.
[time=2398] It went like this, "My baby does the hanky-panky. My baby does the hanky-panky.
[time=2403] My baby does the hanky-panky. My baby does the hanky-panky." Second verse says, "My baby does the hanky." You know how it goes.
[time=2412] But to the ears of a junior high student, all of a sudden this had to be, we didn't know what it was,
[time=2418] but it had to be more than holding hands.
[time=2421] But by the time the '60s came to an end, there would be songs that would speak overtly of sexual permissiveness.
[time=2429] What would those musicians say? After they had led the charge for sexual permissiveness, what would they say of their own lives?
[time=2438] In 1971, Carol King sang these words. If you ever listen to the musician, listen to the pain of these words.
[time=2449] "Tonight, you are mine. So completely, you give your love so sweetly. But will you still love me tomorrow?"
[time=2464] You see, with that voice that could say, "A body is a toy. Experimenter would come the echo of saying, "I feel used.
[time=2473] I feel that you'll take me and you'll use me. And when tomorrow comes, you'll discard me like I'm a disposable bag from the drive-through at a restaurant.
[time=2483] Will you still love me tomorrow?" You see, there'll be no greater pain that will come to your life than if you take your body and you give it as a commodity of exchange.
[time=2497] Because you'll discover a depth of guilt, of shame that can never be reclaimed as it once was before.
[time=2507] Remember this principle in life. There are some things that you can lose that you can never find again.
[time=2516] Genesis 2 tells us of God's creation of the world, of human beings, of men, a man, at least, and a woman.
[time=2527] And dare I say, it is creation of sex. Genesis 2, verse 15, to begin with.
[time=2534] The Lord took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and to care for it.
[time=2540] And the Lord commanded the man, you may eat freely from any tree in the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[time=2550] For when you eat of it, you will surely die.
[time=2554] You say, "Wow, what's that have to do with human sexuality?" Well, in just a moment, we're going to be introduced to a life's partner.
[time=2562] But I discovered before you come to the decision of a life's partner, there has to be preparation.
[time=2569] And these two verses give us the preparation for choosing a life's partner.
[time=2574] In this area of preparation, we come to the discovery, first of life's purpose, then of life's values.
[time=2583] Here is a man. He is placed on a globe. He is singular. He is by himself.
[time=2589] And God comes to him and he says, "I've given you this purpose in life.
[time=2593] Your purpose is to be the caretaker of this planet, this world that I have created."
[time=2600] I believe you are wise, if it's not too late, to choose your life's purpose before you choose your life's partner.
[time=2609] Now, let me illustrate. Suppose I came up to you today and said, "Hey, do you want to go with me this afternoon?"
[time=2616] What do you think you would say? Where? I mean, you probably wouldn't say, "Sure, I'll just where?"
[time=2625] But many of us come to somebody. We fall in love in the late teens, the early twenties, and they say, "Will you like to go through me with..." Can't say that. "Would you like to go with me through life?"
[time=2637] If they're smart, they'll say, "Where are you going?" But most of us want to choose this life's partner and we have no life's purpose. We don't know where we're going.
[time=2648] But more deeply than that, we don't know our life's value.
[time=2652] Here God comes to Adam and he says, "Here is your life's purpose." And then he comes and he gives life's value.
[time=2658] He says, "There is a tree in the midst of the garden. You can eat from every other tree." But that tree, you may not eat from that tree.
[time=2666] Now that's not an elaborate sense of ethics, but it is a value system.
[time=2672] And it is the identical value system that we have to come to today.
[time=2676] It is this singular determinative ethic, "Will I obey God? Or will I not?"
[time=2684] You see, no matter what the ethical dilemma, no matter what the subject or issue, the bottom line to the ethic is this one, "Will I obey God? Or will I not?"
[time=2696] And so God comes to a man and in preparation for a partnership, he would say, "Here is your life's purpose and here is your life's value." I would advise you today, if you're contemplating marriage, to know the purpose of that individual's life and to know their value.
[time=2716] And if they don't have a life's purpose, I wouldn't go with them.
[time=2721] And if they don't have a life ethic that says, "My ethic is to please God and obey." I wouldn't date that one because that is the preparation.
[time=2731] After the preparation, then God introduces us to the plan, verse 18.
[time=2739] The Lord said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
[time=2746] Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and the birds of the air.
[time=2752] And he brought them to the man to see what he would name them.
[time=2755] And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
[time=2759] So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air, and of the beasts of the field.
[time=2765] But for Adam, no suitable helper was found.
[time=2769] So the Lord caused the man to fall into a deep sleep.
[time=2776] And while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh.
[time=2783] Then the Lord made a woman from the rib which he had taken out of the man and he brought her unto the man.
[time=2790] We discover after that preparation of a life's purpose and a life's value, now we are introduced to God's plan.
[time=2797] There is something that we miss if we don't at least look at Genesis chapter 1.
[time=2803] In Genesis chapter 1, verse 4, God creates part of his creation and he says, "It is good."
[time=2814] It's repeated a second time in verse 10.
[time=2820] And God called the dry land.
[time=2823] He called the dry ground land and gathered the waters and he called them seas.
[time=2828] And God saw that it was good.
[time=2831] A third time, he says that in verse 12, it is good.
[time=2836] A fourth time, in verse 18, it is good.
[time=2844] A sixth time, in verse 25, he looks at his creation and he says, "It is good."
[time=2850] And then for a seventh time in Genesis 1, 31, he looks at his creation and he says, "It is very good."
[time=2858] But you see the rhythm that is established, it is good.
[time=2862] It is good.
[time=2864] It is very good to 18.
[time=2867] It is not good.
[time=2871] You see the sharp contrast that God would look at his creation and for the first time in history,
[time=2877] he would see that Adam was alone and he would utter, "It is not good."
[time=2884] Then came the design of Eve.
[time=2889] The plan was to create two things.
[time=2892] First of all, companion ship.
[time=2896] The creation of a human being was not for anything more than intimate companionship.
[time=2906] And this took place in a perfect world with ecological balance.
[time=2911] The lions were not eating the lambs.
[time=2913] Every creature was herbivorous.
[time=2915] There was perfect balance to the universe.
[time=2918] Sin had not marred it physically.
[time=2920] More had sin marred it spiritually and God's relationship to man was unbroken.
[time=2926] And even in the Garden of Eden, it was not good that man was alone.
[time=2933] I want to admit that God gifts some people with a desire and ability to be fully content
[time=2939] and single.
[time=2940] That is marvelous.
[time=2941] But that is not the typical.
[time=2944] God designed here in this perfect environment one who would be a companion.
[time=2949] Secondly, the plan was not only for a companion, but for a co-laborer.
[time=2954] It says there was one who would be a helper.
[time=2957] King James helped meet new international version, a helper suitable.
[time=2963] The concept is one who is simply that a helper in life.
[time=2967] David spoke of his enemies and as he thought of his enemies in first chronicles, he also thought of those who were his helpers.
[time=2976] His allies in the war of life.
[time=2979] The Bible here uses the same term for both.
[time=2982] That as husband and wife, we become each other's partner of companionship.
[time=2987] We become their co-laborer.
[time=2989] We are their life's allies.
[time=2992] That was God's plan to take a man and take a woman and to bring them together.
[time=2997] That was the plan.
[time=2998] Now the process.
[time=3000] Verses 22 and 23. Verses 22, it says that God brought her to the man.
[time=3007] And the man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[time=3013] She shall be called woman for she was taken out of man.
[time=3016] For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united to his wife.
[time=3023] And they will become one flesh.
[time=3025] And the man and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame."
[time=3031] I believe in this process.
[time=3033] Once there is the preparation and we understand God's plan for partnership,
[time=3039] there is a rather interesting process that we go through.
[time=3043] Now his situation, Adams and her situation, Eve, is different in ours.
[time=3047] They didn't date.
[time=3048] They never said, "Well, I think I'll date around." You wasn't anybody else to date.
[time=3055] But there are some things here that I believe that we can observe.
[time=3059] First of all, the first step in the process of bonding is this one.
[time=3063] It is attraction and observation.
[time=3067] Adams was immediately attracted to this woman that was created.
[time=3072] Somebody not actually studying it grammatically only for a point of humor says, "Adam woke up from a deep sleep.
[time=3079] He said, "Wow, man." And hence we get woman.
[time=3084] And that was the attraction that he saw.
[time=3087] A little bit more scholarly today.
[time=3089] Allow me to quote from Kyle and Dalich.
[time=3092] Now you talk about some unromantic guys.
[time=3095] I don't know, maybe they're romantic.
[time=3096] They sure don't write it.
[time=3097] These are the leading commentators on Hebrew.
[time=3101] Kyle and Dalich, right?
[time=3102] The design of God in the creation of woman is perceived by Adam as soon as he awakes.
[time=3108] When the woman has brought to him, without revelation from God, he discovers the woman and says, "This is bone and flesh of my flesh."
[time=3120] The words, "This is now," literary means, "now for me, my bone, my flesh."
[time=3128] There was, for Adam, that instantaneous response of attraction.
[time=3135] That tells us a great deal about the male temperament.
[time=3139] To speak directly today in the process of bonding, you will discover that the first step is that attraction and observation and from the species of the male, that will primarily be a physical attraction
[time=3154] that will take place.
[time=3156] For the female, the attraction is usually not physical as much as is emotional.
[time=3162] The male responses, "What does she look like?" The female responses, "What does he care like?" Here, Adam sees her and the attraction is almost instantaneous.
[time=3173] I believe, and it's well documented, that God has made the two men and women different, that the man is attracted by sight and the woman is attracted by sensitivity.
[time=3185] Can you remember those distinctions?
[time=3187] That's why it is so important, when we come to the scriptures, the teacher about dressing modestly, that is not just an old issue, that is a contemporary issue, because how we dress is a way of speaking
[time=3202] to that male sensitivity of the sight.
[time=3207] The rock villain, Robert Palmer, sings, "I didn't mean to turn you on."
[time=3214] Oh, yes, he did.
[time=3217] And when you buy that toothpaste that promises that your teeth are going to have sex appeal, you did mean to turn someone on.
[time=3224] And when you spray that stuff on that says it's an obsession and they'll never leave you, you did mean to turn them on.
[time=3233] And we as a society are constantly trying to turn each other on.
[time=3240] We fail to recognize that distinction that within the male temperament, there is that appeal to the eye that is instantaneous.
[time=3248] For the lady, there is that appeal to the sensitivity, and so the pornography that would plague the temptation of a man would speak of low interest to a lady, but give to her a romantic novel of one who is sensitive and who cares, and suddenly they'll start to sing,
[time=3267] me and Mrs. Jones, we've got a thing going on.
[time=3273] And it speaks not of one who's attracted to the eyes, but one who can captivate out of sensitivity.
[time=3280] But in that early stages of bonding, there is the attraction in the observation that a couple would go through.
[time=3287] But then after that, there is the stage of investigating and investing.
[time=3293] It then says, the man said, "This is bone of my bones flesh of my flesh."
[time=3299] For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother.
[time=3304] Now let's be honest, Adam didn't say that.
[time=3306] It's called the Nachronism.
[time=3308] Moses, who wrote Genesis, put it in there.
[time=3312] And it speaks of investigation and investment.
[time=3317] That as they come through life, a man and a woman, they now come to a point where they have investigated and they've made investments with each other that they say, "Now I have a reason, a cause that I would want to leave this home and establish a new home." Can I be so blunt in the Old Testament days?
[time=3339] The investment was pretty significant.
[time=3341] I mean, it was a dollar and cents investment.
[time=3344] If you wanted to marry his daughter, your dad had to buy her.
[time=3348] Three camel, two head of oxen, bag of silver, and next year's wine crop.
[time=3354] Sounds like a good deal.
[time=3356] If you'll throw in two more head of oxen, fine.
[time=3360] I mean, that was the investment.
[time=3362] It was negotiated.
[time=3364] But in our society, we don't go through that process, at least most of us don't, but there is still the process of investing.
[time=3372] I don't mean the price that it costs to buy two tickets to a movie and a bag of popcorn because it eats a lot, but the investment goes of the investment of the emotion that, as I tell you, the secrets of my life.
[time=3385] As I let you know, not only of my successes, but I let you know of my failures.
[time=3390] As I let you know my dreams and my secrets, I expose part of my soul to you.
[time=3396] And I give to you that investment of heart to heart, and we now have cause.
[time=3403] Then comes the third step.
[time=3406] Here's the step of commitment and culmination.
[time=3410] Commitment and culmination.
[time=3412] It says, "For this cause they'll leave mother and father.
[time=3415] King James cleave, cling." It's actually a word that could be used to take two objects and to solder them or to glue them together.
[time=3425] There comes a time when there is a commitment that is made.
[time=3430] And following that commitment, the bond that is made, there comes culmination that they become one flesh.
[time=3438] That is a sexual term.
[time=3440] There are those that try to read out of the Bible.
[time=3443] Anything explicit about sick, it is a sexual term.
[time=3446] Paul picks it up in 1 Corinthians 6 and he says, "If you sleep with another woman, you become one flesh with that woman." And so after that commitment, there is the culmination of sexual union and notice verse 25, they were naked and they weren't ashamed.
[time=3462] There was no guilt, there was no embarrassment, there was nothing wrong, it was the very design of God, it was the gift that God would give to take those who were designed to be life's partners, both as companion and co-labor together to bring that to a culmination of union
[time=3481] through sexuality.
[time=3483] That's the very design of God.
[time=3485] But the question is always how soon and how far.
[time=3489] I like Jay Kessler's response when he was President of Youth for Christ.
[time=3493] A group of teenagers says, "How far can you go?" And Jay looked in the face and he said, "Go all the way." And he said, "Oh, go all the way." "This guy has to speak more often." He said, "You ought to go all the way." "You ought to go all the way first, you ought to help me love him." "Then you ought to tell me what to marry him." "Then you ought to go to church." "Then you ought to give him your name." "Then you ought to be committed for life." "Then you ought to go all the way."
