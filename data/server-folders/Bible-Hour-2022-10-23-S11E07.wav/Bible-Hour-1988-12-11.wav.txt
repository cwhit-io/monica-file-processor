[time=166] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=170] Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled says about homosexuality. Christians may be surprised to learn that although the Bible declares that almost sexual acts are sinful it does not place them on a list of unique sins those worse than others. We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 6. We'll be looking at verses 9 through 11. The sanctuary choir will be administering to us from the living Christmas tree.
[time=202] Other special music includes a selection from the children's choir and a duet from Brian Whalen and Joni King.
[time=210] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=222] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=226] Now here's Rick.
[time=228] Christ. We greet those friends who join us by way of television and it's our prayer today that as we worship Christ that his name would be magnified and our own hearts would be lifted up with expectation of his power in our life today.
[time=244] Thank you for joining us.
[time=258] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=432] [APPLAUSE]
[time=440] We've had just a wonderful time the last few evenings enjoying the ministry of the Living Christmas Tree. Special thanks again to all of our musicians and technicians who have been helping us.
[time=452] We've had a very good weekend. We look forward to two concerts today and the ministry of music celebrating the birth of our savior.
[time=460] Let's continue now on music as we sing as the angels did. Gloria in Excelsis Dale, 132.
[time=468] Him number 132 verses one and three.
[time=472] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=596] Now the next choir that will be singing for you has a number of distinct advantages.
[time=600] First of all, before they even open their mouths, they're just beautiful children, aren't they?
[time=604] They're your children. That's why you said yes.
[time=608] They're beautiful. They love the Lord.
[time=612] I am very grateful for the men and women that work with these children week after week. It's quite an accomplishment.
[time=620] They're exuberant young kids that like excitement, but yet settle down to worship and to sing songs about the birth of our Savior. We're glad that they have this opportunity to minister to you now. Let's listen as they sing for us a collection of Christmas songs.
[time=644] Hi Cliff. Are you ready for Christmas?
[time=648] Why do you look so sad? I never know what to get people for Christmas and I never have enough money and I never know whether or not people like what I give them. Oh Cliff, don't you know that Christmas is a time for just listen.
[time=664] Christmas is a time. Christmas is a time.
[time=682] Christmas is a time. Christmas is a time. Christmas is a time. Christmas
[time=694] is a time to love.
[time=698] We often start to worry and people get upset
[time=704] if it's a moment of Christmas day.
[time=710] What we should remember in all the push and shot
[time=716] is Christmas is a time to love.
[time=740] Christmas is a time.
[time=746] Christmas is a time to love.
[time=776] Remember Christmas is a time to celebrate Jesus birthday.
[time=780] Right. I bet there are lots of ways to celebrate Jesus' birthday
[time=786] rather than Brian's presence.
[time=796] Everybody likes to take the holiday.
[time=804] Everybody likes to take a rest.
[time=808] Spending time together with the family.
[time=814] Sharing lots of love and happiness.
[time=820] Warming the bells like the Christmas tree.
[time=824] Jesus is the key for me.
[time=828] Warming the bells everybody say.
[time=834] Jesus, remember it's your birthday.
[time=840] Celebrations coming presents a time in birth.
[time=846] Celebrations we like to recall.
[time=850] Every hand may be born in land of life.
[time=856] The greatest celebration of the long.
[time=860] Warming the bells like the Christmas tree.
[time=866] Jesus is the key for me.
[time=872] Warming the bells like the Christmas tree.
[time=876] Jesus, remember it's your birthday.
[time=882] Warming the bells like the Christmas tree.
[time=888] Jesus is the key for me.
[time=892] Warming the bells everybody say.
[time=898] Jesus, remember it's your birthday.
[time=928] Some of the ways I like to celebrate is to read about Jesus' birthday from the Bible.
[time=934] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby.
[time=938] Keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[time=940] An angel of the Lord appeared to him and the glory of the Lord shone around them.
[time=946] And they were terrified.
[time=948] But an angel said to them, "Do not be afraid.
[time=951] I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people." Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you.
[time=961] He is Christ the Lord.
[time=963] This will be assigned to you.
[time=965] You will find the baby wrapped in claws and lying in the manger.
[time=969] Suddenly a great company of the heavenly hosts appeared with the angel.
[time=973] Praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace be to men whom his favor rests." When the angel had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherd said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,
[time=989] which the Lord has told us about."
[time=1007] All is high, all is high, all is high.
[time=1019] Lough, young virgin, mother, and child.
[time=1027] All we in is of tender and bright.
[time=1036] Sleeping heaven in you is, sleeping heaven in you.
[time=1053] Silent night, holy night.
[time=1061] Silent night, lost your mind.
[time=1070] Pray in peace come by holy base.
[time=1078] With the dawn of free peace.
[time=1085] Jesus, born at thy birth.
[time=1106] When we give the love of Jesus,
[time=1114] it will always fit.
[time=1116] It's never the wrong color, and you don't have to be a millionaire to give it.
[time=1121] It's a gift that goes on and on and on.
[time=1127] What you love to get a present, wrapped up in a Christmas call,
[time=1138] had a gift to us to present, on the night so long ago.
[time=1146] It's a gift that keeps on giving, in our spirits' fantasy.
[time=1153] It's a secret joy of living, if our hearts can just believe.
[time=1161] And the gift goes on, the Father gives a sign, and the gift goes on.
[time=1166] And the sign gives a spirit, the gift goes on.
[time=1170] And the spirit gives a sign, and the gift goes on, the gift goes on.
[time=1175] And the gift goes on, the Father gives a sign, and the gift goes on.
[time=1181] And the sign gives a spirit, the gift goes on.
[time=1184] The spirit gives a sign, and the gift goes on and on and on.
[time=1191] When your heart is full of Christmas, and your life is full of love,
[time=1198] you can give away your present.
[time=1202] And once and, by God above, just like ripples in the water,
[time=1208] a circle of love extends.
[time=1212] What we're starting with, the Father is a gift that has no end.
[time=1219] And the gift goes on, the Father gives a sign, and the gift goes on.
[time=1225] The sign gives a spirit, the gift goes on.
[time=1229] The spirit gives a sign, and the gift goes on, the gift goes on.
[time=1234] And the gift goes on, the Father gives a sign, and the gift goes on.
[time=1240] The sign gives a spirit, the gift goes on.
[time=1243] The spirit gives a sign, and the gift goes on.
[time=1262] We are in the midst of our Living Christmas Tree concert series, and enjoying meeting many friends, watch the Bible hour.
[time=1270] And we're thankful that you've joined us today.
[time=1272] Peter, are you holding up between concert number, or we must be somewhere between numbers, five and six?
[time=1278] We're doing well, Rick.
[time=1279] We've completed four concerts, so we look forward to two today, and then we have a little bit of a reprieve before next weekend.
[time=1285] But things have been going well, and I'm like you.
[time=1288] I enjoy seeing some of the people that usually watch us on television come and join us for the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=1295] Well, I have to tell you a story.
[time=1297] A lady came up to me at the Living Christmas Tree, told me how much she enjoyed the Bible hour, the music, and the preaching, and in the middle of her statement, she said, "You're so small!" She had this impression that we were both about six, six, and the truth is, "I'm five, eight, and a half, but he's only five, eight, so I am a little bigger." You're right, but it has been fun to meet those people, even though we surprised them a little bit.
[time=1321] They are very interesting, and I really do appreciate it when people do stick out their hand or whatever and tell us that they're here from Ohio and different places, and that's really exciting for us.
[time=1333] Well, we hope that many of you do have tickets, and you're able to join us if you don't have tickets.
[time=1338] We apologize.
[time=1339] They've been gone for some time, and we do not have any that we could give to you.
[time=1343] But we hope you could come next year or join us for the Bible hour next Sunday, and you'll see "Singing from the Living Christmas Tree" for one more week.
[time=1351] Today, we want to encourage you to write for a helpful booklet that we would send you free as a gift from us to you.
[time=1358] It has the clear-pointed title, "Moral Purity," and it comes from the pen of my favorite author, Charles Swindall.
[time=1366] I know of no one more gifted than he at both understanding the scriptures
[time=1372] and understanding the needs of people today.
[time=1375] This booklet I know will help many of you who've already compromised your life in this area, but will be a great value to those of us who have not.
[time=1384] "Moral Purity," God's standard for our life.
[time=1388] All of us need help to maintain that, and so we offer you this book today.
[time=1393] Let me encourage you to write today for this booklet, and you can receive it by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1407] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1415] Thank you, Pete. I know during these holidays, many of you are looking for opportunities to worship, and for the friends who are in the northern Indiana area, and to invite you to our Christmas Eve candlelight service.
[time=1429] It's a time where we come together in a very quiet, worshipful way to acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1436] We call it a candlelight service because that's how we decorate the interior of our auditorium, and it's also a time of communion where we celebrate not only the birth of Christ, but recognize that he was born, that he might die for our sins.
[time=1450] And if you do not have plans, we ask you to make plans to worship Christ during this Christmas, and we want to invite you to join us at 6 o'clock on Christmas Eve, December the 24th, here at our new worship center.
[time=1463] We would be delighted if you were able to come.
[time=1466] Thank you for joining us today here for the Bible hour.
[time=1469] We trust that God will use our time together, singing and studying to strengthen your faith in Christ.
[time=1481] [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=1557] The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[time=1561] On those living in a land of deep darkness, a light has dawn.
[time=1566] Arise, shine, for your light has come.
[time=1570] [MUSIC - 82 seconds]
[time=1659] For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given,
[time=1665] and the government shall be upon his shoulders, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.
[time=1681] [MUSIC]
[time=1688] For unto us a child is born, our son is given, come Holy Spirit, come Father this child, the virgin Mary shall be his mother, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.
[time=1708] Sing Hallelujah to the wonderful Counselor, sing Hallelujah to the mighty God, sing Hallelujah to the Father, forever and sing Hallelujah to the children for peace.
[time=1727] Hallelujah, hallelujah, celebrate the bread of this child, mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, in the new love.
[time=1747] Sing Hallelujah to the wonderful Counselor, sing Hallelujah to the mighty God, sing Hallelujah to the Father, forever and sing Hallelujah to the children for peace.
[time=1767] [MUSIC]
[time=1785] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1791] As the song has expressed, we have come today to celebrate the child, Jesus Christ the Lord.
[time=1799] And so I invite you to bow with me that by the very posture of prayer, we can say we recognize the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
[time=1809] Our God and our Father, our Savior, Lord Jesus, we bow before you this morning to acknowledge that you are both Lord and God.
[time=1818] We worship you today as our Savior.
[time=1822] We come to you this morning to give to you the praise of our hearts, to declare that we love you and to seek your forgiveness.
[time=1832] We confess as a body of people that this week has been marked with sin, that our own personal lives have dishonored you with disobedience, and we come to ask your forgiveness and to be cleansed.
[time=1847] We ask you Holy Spirit to make us ever conscious of those areas of our life
[time=1853] that are still out of obedience to the Word of God.
[time=1858] We ask you to trouble us and prompt us and give us a hunger for righteousness.
[time=1864] We pray today for those who are enslaved to habits that they would seek to break.
[time=1870] We pray for those who have created a sexual appetite, and now their passion controls them, that you would break the power of canceled sin and set the captive free.
[time=1882] We pray today for those who have become addicted to substances and who only know the inner urge for more, that your spirit would be there to give them that inner urge to live a life for you.
[time=1897] So we pray for men and women who are trying to break those habits.
[time=1902] We pray this morning for those who are prisoner, held hostage by the bars of their own bitterness, that you would bring to us a spirit of forgiveness, that with a season of celebration there would also come a time of application when we say, "I will forgive." And so today we come to you and ask you to work in our midst.
[time=1925] And we would pray that there would come a unique ministry of comfort, particularly for those who have lost loved ones.
[time=1933] We pray today for John Taylor as he faces the first Christmas without his wife.
[time=1939] We pray particularly for families like the Dells of lost children this past year,
[time=1945] and the holiday is not the same.
[time=1947] We pray for the Wagner's and their loss over Memorial Day of little Sarah.
[time=1953] With each of these holidays, there comes that tender pain deep within.
[time=1959] And only you can comfort it, Lord.
[time=1962] So we ask you to pour it out.
[time=1964] We ask you to make of us a generous people that we are giving of our time to each other, of our love, and of our forgiveness.
[time=1974] Just as it's been freely given to us, help us to give it.
[time=1979] For Christ's name and his sake, amen.
[time=1984] It is such a great joy and privilege for us to have the ministry of the living Christmas tree where we announce that Jesus Christ has been born.
[time=1997] The very theme of our cantata this year is beautiful Savior, and it speaks of the fact that the Old Testament would predict that God would send us Savior, one who would forgive.
[time=2010] And then we come to the New Testament, and it teaches us this central truth that He, Jesus Christ, is able to save them to the utmost who would come unto Him.
[time=2022] That means the utmost.
[time=2024] This morning in a Sunday school class, a young man shared it out of his life of rebellion to God.
[time=2030] He had engaged in sexual permissiveness.
[time=2033] He had engaged in substance abuse, but Jesus Christ was able to come into his heart and change his life.
[time=2040] That beautiful Savior is able to save to the utmost, those who would come unto Him.
[time=2046] And we're so excited to hear that announcement.
[time=2049] But how excited would we be to date if we discovered that there is an individual, maybe seated next to us, who their sin was one that was so foreign to us.
[time=2060] It was one that we have placed on a special list of sins that are more repugnant than others.
[time=2068] What if that one had engaged in homosexual activity?
[time=2073] Would we today say, "Oh, I'm so glad that you've come." You sit next to me.
[time=2078] I want you to know that the tree in front of you speaks of one who can save to the utmost.
[time=2084] That means me.
[time=2085] That means you.
[time=2086] You sit by me today.
[time=2089] The Bible tells us four things about homosexuality.
[time=2093] The Church of Jesus Christ is excellent of declaring two of those four.
[time=2099] The second two, we are often weak on stressing what the Bible says.
[time=2104] And so this morning, we come to the scriptures to study what is it the Bible would tell us about homosexuality.
[time=2111] If you have a copy of the scriptures, I invite you to open it to 1 Corinthians, chapter 6, and verses 9 through 11.
[time=2119] We'll look at various passages today, but this is the passage that speaks the clearest.
[time=2125] 1 Corinthians, chapter 6, verse 9.
[time=2132] Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[time=2138] Don't be deceived.
[time=2140] Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexual fenders, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor slander-ers, nor swindlers, or inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2160] And that is what some of you were, but you were washed.
[time=2166] You were sanctified.
[time=2168] You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of God.
[time=2176] This morning, I want to share a number of insights with you, actually, nine of those, and one of those will be coming back to this passage.
[time=2185] But allow me to tell you nine things that I believe you and I should know about homosexuality.
[time=2192] First, I believe that we should know that it is not a new problem.
[time=2197] There are times when we come to contemporary issues and there are those who want to take the Bible and close it and say, "Well, the Bible doesn't speak to this issue.
[time=2206] This is a contemporary issue." And the Bible is so old, it couldn't possibly address our concerns today.
[time=2214] Homosexuality is not a new issue.
[time=2217] In fact, one of the oldest recorded references to this subject is in the Bible itself.
[time=2224] Four thousand years ago, in the life of Abraham, there was an encounter with his son, Nephew, and the theme of homosexuality and how would it be dealt with?
[time=2236] The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were the focal point of those events and it's recorded in the scriptures as taking place four thousand years ago.
[time=2246] It is not a new subject.
[time=2249] Plato and Socrates, Greek philosophers, held in the highest esteem for their intellectual ability, both were avidly participants in homosexuality.
[time=2263] One of Plato's writings is called his Symposium on Love and it is a glorification of homosexual love.
[time=2272] In the days of Rome's glory, there were fifteen emperors in a period of time called the Pax Romana, fourteen of them engaged in homosexuality.
[time=2286] All of that is simply that you would know that this is an old problem
[time=2292] and the Bible is as contemporary as life today.
[time=2295] Don't dismiss it today.
[time=2297] Don't say God hasn't spoken on today's issues.
[time=2301] The Word of God, it's living and it's powerful and it's able to speak to your every need this morning.
[time=2307] Secondly, you should know that homosexuality is a growing problem.
[time=2312] It has been a part of history at every century, but there are times and there are cultures where that problem seems to explode
[time=2322] and this culture and these times are one of those points in history.
[time=2328] It has been wisely noted that it is the poet and the philosopher,
[time=2334] the artist and the musician who often shapes a society's values and that is so true.
[time=2342] Today we live in a time when the artists of our day use the media of music and television to bring to us their view of life.
[time=2354] It began in the 70s as more and more of the rock musicians were investigating
[time=2360] and exploring all forms of sexuality that suddenly through the media of rock music
[time=2367] there would come the announcement of the value of homosexual love or a subtle and it was sly and only those who had an ear to listen and did a little reading would know but the message was clear to a secret audience.
[time=2381] A group of men would come out, they would call themselves the village people and they would sing a song called YMCA.
[time=2389] You'd turn on your radio and you'd say the YMCA, that's where you go down and you shoot baskets and you're right around the track.
[time=2395] That's what we go to the YMCA for but what they were saying is homosexual is I'll meet you at the YMCA.
[time=2404] Almost every high school in Fort Wayne became intoxicated with a secular song in the late 70s.
[time=2410] It had a beat that would grab you, it went we will, we will rock you.
[time=2417] And almost every school adopted that and met their basketball games and their volleyball games.
[time=2422] They would stomp their feet and say we will, we will rock you.
[time=2426] That song was produced by a group by the name of Queen who, on his shamelessly says the name Queen refers to a male homosexual playing the role of a female and we will, we will rock you.
[time=2440] It was written to be the liberation song of the gay movement.
[time=2445] You turn on your television set.
[time=2448] A show comes across and it portrays homosexuality as an alternate lifestyle.
[time=2454] And a whole society is bombarded with counter communications.
[time=2461] It's right, it's wrong, it's right, it's wrong.
[time=2466] And the generation goes up and says nobody knows what's right or wrong except for me.
[time=2471] It's a growing problem.
[time=2474] The third thing you should know are those things that actually contribute to homosexual behavior.
[time=2480] You may be sitting here today, you may be my age and you may say I'm 36 years old, I've never been involved in that, I'll never be involved in that.
[time=2488] If I've got sexual problems, they aren't that kind.
[time=2491] Why are you exposing me to all of this?
[time=2494] Because if you today are 36 years old, you may have the greatest influence in our society in this area.
[time=2503] Allow me to share with you the things that we think lead to homosexual behavior.
[time=2509] There are two completely different schools of thought.
[time=2512] There's the school of thought that sees it as primarily a biological phenomena.
[time=2517] There is another school of thought that sees it as learned behavior.
[time=2521] Those of the biological schools see homosexuality as that which is a product of genetics, of hormones and a brain function.
[time=2530] They like to argue that being homosexual is no different than being right-handed or left-handed, it's just the way you're oriented.
[time=2539] Some early studies by men like Culliman out of Germany, Kinsey indicated that there were strong hereditary factors in homosexuality and we cannot ignore those.
[time=2551] But the predominant view of our day and the weight of the evidence is that it's not primarily biological,
[time=2558] it is primarily a learned behavior.
[time=2561] If it is primarily a learned behavior, what are those things that shape that behavior?
[time=2566] Allow me to share very quickly with you several of those.
[time=2570] First and foremost, more than any other factor, more than all of the other factors that I'll give you today put together,
[time=2578] this is the single strongest factor, our parents.
[time=2585] That's why today this message is for me as a father because you see the greatest determinative factor and a young person's sexual identification is their parents,
[time=2597] particularly men, their fathers.
[time=2601] If there is a father who is absent from the home physically or psychologically, that is the strongest component in the development of a homosexual matrix.
[time=2613] A kin to that is the father who is either hostile or more typically apathetic and indifferent.
[time=2621] In one particular study, which is just one study, but in this study of 40 homosexuals, 40 out of 40 said, "I hate my dad."
[time=2634] He was never there, or he was in the chair, but he was never there.
[time=2643] The parental factor is so strong.
[time=2648] Combined in either absent or passive father who abdicates decision-making with a mother who is domineering,
[time=2658] has the ability to bind the children to her, you have the ideal situation to produce homosexuality.
[time=2670] That is the strongest factor.
[time=2674] You see what happens is a child grows up in that home and maybe it's a little boy who says, "I don't like my dad.
[time=2682] I don't want to be like my dad.
[time=2685] I like my mom." Unconsciously or consciously, there comes that identification, and the role reversal takes place within that personality.
[time=2697] Or it might be a little girl who says, "Not much to men.
[time=2702] They just sit there and watch football.
[time=2706] I don't want to be around men." Or it could be someone who grows up and because there's no man in the home, he says as a young boy,
[time=2715] "I'm consciously, I don't know how to be a man.
[time=2718] There's no model. There's no footprints for me to follow."
[time=2724] It could be a little girl who grows up and says, "My mom is so bitter, so domineering, so binding.
[time=2733] I don't want to be a woman like that." A second factor is fear of failure.
[time=2741] It's really another way of saying self-esteem.
[time=2745] A person grows up and they look at themselves and they say, "I'm not what I ought to be as a man.
[time=2750] I mean, I don't have a deep voice.
[time=2753] I don't have broad shoulders. I can't play sports." I'm kind of small and frail and I don't see myself as very manly, so I'll withdraw from the man's world.
[time=2766] It can be the young girl who says, "I don't feel that I'm pretty.
[time=2771] I don't feel that anybody would find me attractive." And they're afraid that they might fail in that world of normal sexual identification.
[time=2783] And so they retreat.
[time=2786] A third factor is detachment from normal activities.
[time=2793] It sounds strange.
[time=2796] But if little girls at young ages don't like to play dress up and put on makeup and play with dolls,
[time=2804] that's a hint that there's an early problem.
[time=2806] And if little boys grow up and they don't like to play things that are kind of loud and physical
[time=2812] and if they don't rattle the China cabinet once a day, be suspicious.
[time=2819] One of the wisest things we could do is never to say to a little girl, "Would you stop playing dress up all the time?
[time=2827] Don't put that makeup all over your face." I remember one of our little girls came downstairs and we said, "Honey, have you been playing with mommy's makeup?" She kind of smiled and said, "How did you know?" You knew how we knew.
[time=2842] I mean, there was lipstick that covered the lips, the nose, the chin, the ears.
[time=2846] There was enough rouge on to make her look like Clare Bell the Clown.
[time=2851] She thought she was beautiful.
[time=2853] You know, the smartest thing we could have ever done.
[time=2855] I wish I'd have done it would say, "Honey, you look beautiful." And allow a little girl to be a little girl.
[time=2863] And allow a little boy to be a little boy.
[time=2865] I've told you this before, but when we had Adam as a little boy, we weren't sure that we wanted him running around playing with guns.
[time=2871] You know, that just seemed kind of violent and mom particularly was concerned.
[time=2875] I want you to know that kid has more guns than the U.S. arsenal.
[time=2880] We decided that he could have all the toy guns when he wanted, when he reached under the sink, pulled out his mother's feather duster and went, "Phew, phew, phew." Every stick, every object became a gun.
[time=2895] You know, to take a little boy and allow him to be a little bit on the rough side is a good thing.
[time=2899] It's part of that role identification.
[time=2903] Another component, according to the experts, is that more significant than we can imagine is sexual violation or sexual abuse.
[time=2918] It's like taking that part of the brain that identifies sexual behavior and scrambling it.
[time=2925] When that little one is abused or is violated even into the teen years, it's like taking an egg and scrambling it and then trying to put all the pieces back together.
[time=2938] A fifth one.
[time=2940] Early experiences.
[time=2942] Psychologically and physiologically are so important.
[time=2948] There's a lot of different theories of behavior, but almost all of them recognize the significant of early experiences.
[time=2956] I don't know if you remember early experiences in your life.
[time=2959] I can remember some of those so clear.
[time=2961] I can remember early experiences of putting up our family Christmas tree.
[time=2965] My father remembers those early experiences at two when I pulled them over.
[time=2969] But do you remember early experiences?
[time=2972] If an individual has had a sexual encounter early in their life, that early experience can become very formative.
[time=2980] And if it's been homosexual, their body actually physically becomes a condition reflex.
[time=2988] And it's a learned behavior from which they often find great difficulty escaping.
[time=2994] Oftentimes there's the confusion of good, normal, healthy love between two women or two men.
[time=3000] Friends is friends ought to be there, often becomes the confusion.
[time=3004] Is there something sexual there?
[time=3007] But one of the strongest factors in our society is that homosexuality increases in a society where it is approved of.
[time=3016] Now back to 1 Corinthians.
[time=3018] What does the Bible say about homosexuality?
[time=3021] Four things that you should know today.
[time=3024] The first thing that you should know today is the Bible cuts no slack.
[time=3028] It says homosexuality is sinful.
[time=3032] It's the constant theme of the Bible.
[time=3035] In Genesis chapter 18 and 19, we are told that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for their sin and their wickedness.
[time=3043] And the one particular sin that was noted was homosexual behavior.
[time=3047] And it's from that event that we get one descriptive term of homosexuality, sodomy.
[time=3054] It comes from the name of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=3058] And the Bible clearly therein described it as wickedness.
[time=3063] In Leviticus chapter 18 and verse 12, the Bible says, "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman."
[time=3073] Clear to the point.
[time=3075] In the New Testament, in Romans chapter 1 it says this, "Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lust.
[time=3084] Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones, in the same way the men also abandoned the natural relations with women
[time=3095] and were inflamed with lust one to another.
[time=3098] Men committed indecent acts with other men."
[time=3104] And here the Bible lists in 1 Corinthians chapter 6, a series of sins, by no means a total list.
[time=3113] And tells us that it is sinful and not to be tolerated for those who inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=3121] Two particular terms are noted here for our study today.
[time=3125] The first is the phrase male prostitute.
[time=3129] Actually the word in the King James is effeminate.
[time=3133] It's really a word that has nothing to do with prostitution in the exchange of sex for money.
[time=3139] It's a word that describes somebody who is not effeminate because their voice may be high.
[time=3144] I'm not against men who have high voices since I have one.
[time=3148] It refers to that individual who chooses to be the female in a homosexual relationship.
[time=3157] That's why the King James called it the effeminate.
[time=3161] It was the passive role in a homosexual relationship.
[time=3164] The next word in 1 Corinthians chapter 6, it says homosexual offenders.
[time=3169] That's the individual who played the active role.
[time=3172] The Bible knows something of the sin where of it speaks.
[time=3176] And it describes it here as sinful.
[time=3179] But I would also want you to have this subnote in your mind.
[time=3182] It doesn't describe it as uniquely sinful.
[time=3185] God doesn't have classifications of sins that these sins are bad and please don't do them.
[time=3191] But these sins are terrible.
[time=3194] You know what he says?
[time=3196] He says that the homosexual is in the same list with the greedy.
[time=3201] The greedy.
[time=3203] Those of us who simply have an appetite who say I want it.
[time=3206] I have to have more.
[time=3209] It's not classified as unique or special.
[time=3212] The second thing the Bible says is that it is unnatural.
[time=3217] We just read Romans chapter 1 and it says God allowed them because of their present sinfulness.
[time=3223] They proceed on their path of sinfulness so that they stopped doing what is natural and they had an appetite for what is unnatural.
[time=3233] Men with men, women with women and the Bible says it's downright unnatural.
[time=3241] And so you'll come to 1 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 9 and it will use the word perverts.
[time=3247] It's the same word as 1 Corinthians is translating homosexual fender.
[time=3252] It is perverted because it is unnatural.
[time=3257] But the third thing that the Bible says about homosexuality is this one.
[time=3261] It is forgivable.
[time=3264] If you hear nothing else today, would you please hear this?
[time=3268] If you're struggling with homosexuality, if you have a son or a daughter or a friend of his, please know this.
[time=3274] The Bible says that it's forgivable.
[time=3277] Look at 1 Corinthians chapter 6.
[time=3280] After it lists all of these sins, it becomes verse 11 and it says in the King James.
[time=3285] And such were some of you, new international, and that is what some of you were.
[time=3295] But you have been washed.
[time=3299] You have been sanctified.
[time=3306] But love it today, if that's a struggle in your life, would you know that Jesus Christ loves you?
[time=3311] He doesn't put you into a special class of sinners that are worse than other sinners.
[time=3315] He doesn't reject you.
[time=3317] He says, "I love you today and I will receive you and I will take you and I will forgive you.
[time=3324] And with my own blood, I will wash away your sin.
[time=3328] And I will sanctify you.
[time=3330] That means that I will pick you up and I will put you in a special class." Do you have anything that's special where you have several of the same thing?
[time=3338] I do.
[time=3339] I have a special pair of shoes.
[time=3341] They are jogging shoes.
[time=3342] And then I have another pair that look just like them, but they are not the same.
[time=3345] These jogging shoes, I will cut the grass in and carry out the trash and paint.
[time=3351] But they are the East pair of jogs.
[time=3353] I just jog and those are special.
[time=3357] You know, God says that he will take us and he will take us out of a sea of humanity.
[time=3361] He will pick us up and he loves us so much.
[time=3363] He says, "I will put you in a group that I call special, your mind.
[time=3367] And today, even if your sin is one of great, great shame, God said, "I will wash you.
[time=3373] I will collect you unto myself and I will make you special to me." The fourth thing that the Bible tells us about homosexuality is not only is it
[time=3386] forgivable, but it is changeable.
[time=3392] It says, "Such were some of you." But there had come a transformation of life.
[time=3401] There were those who were immoral, but there was a change.
[time=3416] How can you change today?
[time=3419] The Bible and modern secular studies say the same things.
[time=3425] Here's how you can change today.
[time=3427] Allow me to suggest these five steps.
[time=3430] One, you must recognize that homosexual behavior is sinful.
[time=3436] Secular psychologists tell us that the greatest agent in change is the individual
[time=3442] who believes with conviction that their actions are wrong.
[time=3448] If you don't believe that your behavior is wrong, your change factor shrinks.
[time=3455] But if there is a strong inter-conviction that it is wrong, your change factor increases.
[time=3463] And if you today would like to be unshackled from this sin, you must admit that it is sinful.
[time=3470] 1 John says, "We must confess our sins, and He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins
[time=3477] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." You must begin by saying, "I cannot excuse it.
[time=3482] I cannot blame it. I cannot justify it.
[time=3485] I must admit that it's sinful." The second thing that you must do is remove yourself from temptation.
[time=3493] The counselor is called environmental planning.
[time=3497] It's not giving yourself, as Romans put it, any occasion to the lust to fulfill its desire.
[time=3512] It's been our privilege today to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir from the living Christmas tree, and our children's choirs, and a duet from Brian Whalen and Joni King.
[time=3524] The message today was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3527] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3532] Before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3535] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3538] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this Christmas season and the reminder that you came to be a baby
[time=3545] and then eventually to die for my sins.
[time=3548] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3552] I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior.
[time=3558] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3562] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us?
