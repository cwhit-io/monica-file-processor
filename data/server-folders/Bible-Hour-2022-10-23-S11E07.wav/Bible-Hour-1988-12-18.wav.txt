[time=110] The time to celebrate Christmas is finally here.
[time=113] For weeks, there has been a time of hustle and bustle as we have gone to the malls and to the stores looking for presents for all of our family.
[time=122] What will I buy for my wife?
[time=124] What will I buy for Aunt Susie or Uncle Fred?
[time=128] These are questions that need to be asked and they need to be answered.
[time=133] But I wonder today if you've asked yourself another question.
[time=137] Why are we celebrating Christmas?
[time=140] Why are we celebrating this time of the year?
[time=145] Of course, we're celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, the wonderful Messiah.
[time=150] We're celebrating Him coming to earth and dwelling among us.
[time=154] But most important of all, we must remember, that it was for one purpose that Jesus came, to go to the cross of Calvary, to shed His blood and die for us that we might have everlasting life.
[time=168] There's a power in the cross.
[time=171] There is a power in the cross today that is available to all of us if we will only reach out and receive Christ as our Savior and Lord.
[time=182] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship
[time=197] on the Bible Hour.
[time=199] Thank you for joining us.
[time=201] Our speaker today is Jim Pearson, Elementary Christian Education Director here at Black Hawk.
[time=206] Jim's message is entitled "The Power of the Cross." We encourage you to open your Bibles and follow along with us.
[time=214] Our text is taken from the Book of Galatians, chapter 6, verses 14 through 16.
[time=220] The teen choir will be singing a Christmas medley from the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=225] Other special music includes a song from our Minister of Youth, Jim Teter, and a solo from Lisa Reniker.
[time=235] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=244] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=248] Now, here's Rick.
[time=250] I believe that he is alive.
[time=252] We're delighted that you're here.
[time=254] We want to welcome you to the home of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, a new sanctuary, a place of meeting, of sharing praise.
[time=262] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television, and that we trust whether you're here in person or whether you're watching by way of television, that you'll sense today that there is a Savior who cares about you, that Jesus Christ died for your sins.
[time=278] Always celebrate today that he has come, but let us never forget that he came with a purpose.
[time=283] That purpose was that you and I might know forgiveness of sins.
[time=287] Thank you for worshiping with us today.
[time=289] Our teen choir is going to minister to us in music as they have filled the living Christmas tree.
[time=317] [MUSIC - 131 seconds]
[time=463] [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] Oh, let us adore Him [MUSIC] O come, let us adore Him [MUSIC] Let us adore Him [MUSIC] Let us adore Him [MUSIC] Amen, amen, amen [MUSIC] Amen, amen, amen [MUSIC] Amen, amen, amen [MUSIC] Yes, amen, amen [MUSIC] Yes, amen, amen [MUSIC] Amen, amen [MUSIC] Baby Jesus, please don't cry [MUSIC] Now let me wipe those tears from the wrath [MUSIC] You cry as though your heart would break [MUSIC] Please don't spend your first night away [MUSIC] And baby sleeping in the hay [MUSIC] The son of God who came to save the light [MUSIC] The only one that's true [MUSIC] Will die upon a cross for you [MUSIC] Well, I wonder if this Christmas [MUSIC] They'll begin to understand [MUSIC] That Jesus that they celebrate [MUSIC] Was much more than a man [MUSIC] 'Cause the way the world is [MUSIC] I don't see how people can deny [MUSIC] The only way to save us [MUSIC] Was for Jesus Christ to die [MUSIC] And I know [MUSIC] That if Saint Nicholas was here [MUSIC] That he would agree [MUSIC] That Jesus gave the greatest gift of all [MUSIC] So you and me [MUSIC] They led him to the slaughter [MUSIC] On a hill called Calvary [MUSIC] And mankind was forgiven [MUSIC] When they nailed him to the tree [MUSIC] But most of all the children [MUSIC] They're the ones I hope to learn [MUSIC] That Jesus is our Savior [MUSIC] And he's going to return [MUSIC] And Christmas isn't just a day [MUSIC] And all days aren't the same [MUSIC] Perhaps they'll think about the word [MUSIC] And see it spells his name [MUSIC] And I know [MUSIC] That if Saint Nicholas was here [MUSIC] That he would agree [MUSIC] That Jesus gave the greatest gift of all [MUSIC] So you and me [MUSIC] They led him to the slaughter [MUSIC] On a hill called Calvary [MUSIC] And mankind was forgiven [MUSIC] When they nailed him to the tree [MUSIC] So have yourself a merry Christmas [MUSIC] But I wonder if this Christmas [MUSIC] Will be given to understand [MUSIC] Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining [MUSIC] It is the night of our dear Savior's birth [MUSIC] Long lay the world and sin in their pining [MUSIC] 'Til he appeared in a soul filled with words [MUSIC] A thrill of heart [MUSIC] While we before we joined this [MUSIC] We are under great, our new and glorious star [MUSIC] Oh, holy, holy, oh, holy [MUSIC] Oh, holy, holy, holy [MUSIC] Oh, holy, holy, oh, holy [MUSIC] Oh, holy, holy, holy [MUSIC] Oh, holy, holy, holy [MUSIC] He has loved one another, his love is love [MUSIC] And his gospel is peace [MUSIC] She shall he pray [MUSIC] For the slave is our brother [MUSIC] And his name of precious peace [MUSIC] He feels our joy in great, our brothers [MUSIC] Praise me, holy, holy [MUSIC] Praise me, holy, holy [MUSIC] Love is thunder and praise are His name [MUSIC] Christ is the Lord [MUSIC] Praise him, his name for him [MUSIC] Praise him, holy, holy [MUSIC] Praise him, holy, holy [MUSIC] Oh, come let us adore Him [MUSIC] Lord, come let us adore Him [MUSIC] Oh, come let us adore Him [MUSIC] Christ [MUSIC] Oh, come let us adore Him [MUSIC] Praise him, holy, holy â™ª
[time=1535] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1545] Thank you, Lisa, for that bold announcement that Jesus Christ is the Lord.
[time=1551] And I invite you to bow with me that we could pray together under His name.
[time=1556] Our God and our Father, we bow before you today.
[time=1560] And we would pray that you would be glorified in this very service.
[time=1564] We pray that you would capture each heart that's here.
[time=1567] And gently but surely draw them to the name of Christ.
[time=1572] May there be those today who are born again into your family.
[time=1576] May there be those today that understand that Christmas is an opportunity to discover eternal life.
[time=1583] And we pray this morning for the encouragement of believers.
[time=1587] We would ask for sons and daughters who are grown.
[time=1590] And yet, walking in rebellion, that there would be an attraction back to Christ, a redidication this morning.
[time=1597] We pray for those who have gone through hard valleys.
[time=1600] We thank you for Dottie Roadenbach's good news and recovery from surgery.
[time=1605] We pray for the Civitz family and Bill's home going.
[time=1608] And pray that even a body of believers might be an encouragement to them today.
[time=1613] As we meet today in your name, we want to glorify you, O Lord Jesus, amen.
[time=1621] This morning, it's my privilege to introduce to you a gentleman who's a part of our church staff, Jim Pearson.
[time=1628] Jim has worked with us for a number of years in an administrative position, coordinating some of our Christian education programs and assisting in a lot of pastoral responsibilities.
[time=1639] Jim took the initiative as a businessman to change his career path to leave a very successful business career and to head into the ministry.
[time=1649] He's been with us a number of years here at Blackhawk.
[time=1652] And at the same time, he's been taking classes during a master's degree in the study of divinity at Grace Seminary.
[time=1658] Jim will complete that degree in the month of May.
[time=1661] And at that time, Lord willing, he'll be coming full time with our staff.
[time=1665] And this morning, Jim was prepared of heart and of life to teach God's Word, and he will deliver our message today.
[time=1672] Jim Pearson, we welcome you to our church, though you're a part of us.
[time=1676] Many have not met Jim and his wife Linda.
[time=1678] If you're part of the school and the Sunday school, you'll know them.
[time=1681] Jim, would you come this morning to teach us God's Word?
[time=1688] Thank you, Rick, for saying all of those very nice things.
[time=1692] I know you're only saying them because they're all true.
[time=1695] I heard about a nervous young minister one time who, after a similar introduction such as that,
[time=1701] walked up to the microphone, and the first thing he said was this.
[time=1705] I know that I don't appreciate anything that was said about me, but I do deserve it from the bottom of my heart.
[time=1713] If you have a Bible with you this morning, I'd like you to turn with me to the sixth chapter of the Book of Galatians.
[time=1719] The sixth chapter of the Book of Galatians.
[time=1723] We're going to be studying this morning versus 14, 15, and 16 as Paul closes this epistle, a very, very important letter to the various churches of Galatia.
[time=1738] Father, thank you for this chance to worship with you this morning, to worship you, to trust that you will bless us.
[time=1747] We thank you for the way that you have met with us already today, for the music, for the tree, and all of the wonderful parts of the service that have gone on so far.
[time=1757] Just ask your blessing upon the ministry of the Word now in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1764] If I were to ask you to take out a piece of paper and write down the first thing that came to your mind when you heard the word power, I believe that we would receive hundreds of different responses.
[time=1778] For the word power conjures in our minds many different things to many different people.
[time=1784] To my seven-year-old son, power is Michael Jordan going down the floor dribbling the basketball, getting ready to take one last step at the foul line and then slamming the ball home.
[time=1801] As I was preparing this message this morning, power to me was Eric Dickerson running down the field, breaking into the open and running toward the goal line.
[time=1813] And I pictured Mike Singletary of the Chicago Bears coming up to try to make the tackle.
[time=1819] And I know that we have many Bears fans here this morning, but in my imagination Eric Dickerson put his head down and just bold Mike Singletary over and stumbled his way into the end zone.
[time=1832] That's power. That's power.
[time=1835] To a young man by the name of John Dean, power was yet something else.
[time=1842] John Dean at the age of 30 in 1970 was an up-and-coming government attorney.
[time=1849] He was working for the Justice Department.
[time=1852] He was a staff attorney with a promising future.
[time=1855] He was young, handsome, ambitious, he was on his way up.
[time=1860] One day a telephone call came at lunchtime.
[time=1865] It was the Western White House in San Clemente calling and they wanted him to get on a plane and to go to meet with Richard Nixon right away.
[time=1874] John Dean ran home, packed a suitcase, caught the next plane out of Washington and was in San Clemente that very afternoon.
[time=1882] The President of the United States wanted 30-year-old John Dean to be his special counsel.
[time=1888] He wanted this young man to be his chief legal advisor.
[time=1893] John Dean writes that he was taken up immediately by the power that he saw in the Nixon White House.
[time=1901] You were judged by how much power you had, by the size of the office that you had, by the size of your staff.
[time=1912] If you had a large office and a large staff scurrying about, you projected an image in the Nixon White House of power, a man who was on his way up.
[time=1923] But if you had an office that was small, or if you had an office that was getting smaller as people were moving ahead of you, you were considered to lack power and to be on your way out.
[time=1938] John Dean made the decision that he would seek an office near Richard Nixon, and he would get ahead. He would gain power, no matter what it might take.
[time=1948] Those of us who know the story of the early '70s in America will remember the Watergate scandal.
[time=1954] John Dean, in his climb to the top, became the chief architect of the cover-up of the Watergate scandal.
[time=1962] It cost him his job. It cost him his legal practice. He eventually went to jail and served time for his role.
[time=1971] In his lust for power, he writes in his fine book, Blind Ambition, that he did whatever it took to get the job done. He wanted power.
[time=1989] The Apostle Paul in the book of Galatians is also writing about power. But the Apostle Paul gives us a totally different perspective and attitude toward power.
[time=2004] If anyone had a right to boast, if anyone had a right to claim to fame, it was the Apostle Paul.
[time=2013] Paul writes to us in the book of Philippians that he was a Hebrew of Hebrews, a pure Hebrew, born of pure Hebrew parents,
[time=2023] that he was of the tribe of Benjamin. That means that he was a member of the tribe from which the first king of Israel came.
[time=2031] Oh, he was from an important lineage, an important background. At a young age, the Apostle Paul received the finest in education.
[time=2039] Like John Dean in American Politics, the Apostle Paul was climbing the road to the top of the religious system of his day.
[time=2049] He writes in Philippians that he had progressed far above most of the contemporaries of his day.
[time=2057] The Apostle Paul was on his way up. He had power.
[time=2062] But one day Paul met Jesus Christ on the Damascus road. And there was a change. Something came over him.
[time=2072] And his perspective on power ceased to be that of getting ahead or accomplishing what he could or walking on people if that's what it took.
[time=2083] In the book of Galatians in this closing section, he begins to give us a proper perspective.
[time=2090] He speaks about power, the power of the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2100] Beginning with verse 14, the Apostle Paul says this, "But may it never be that I should boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world,
[time=2118] for neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
[time=2124] And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God."
[time=2131] From these verses this morning, I would like us to see three examples of the power of the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2140] Three examples of the power that can be ours if we will trust in the cross of Christ.
[time=2147] First of all, in verse 14, we see that it has the power to free men from slavery, the power to free men from slavery,
[time=2159] through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
[time=2166] When Jesus Christ came to earth and died upon the cross of Calvary, he unleashed a power that has never been seen before or since,
[time=2176] a tremendous power whereby you and I can be freed from the slavery of the world.
[time=2184] The Bible talks about an evil world system that is in control of the world in which we live today.
[time=2191] The Greek word that Paul uses for world is cosmos.
[time=2195] It's just a term that is used to describe the evil system that Satan is in control of here on earth at the present time.
[time=2205] In one way or another, all who do not know Christ are in some way under this bondage of this evil world system.
[time=2214] But through the cross of Christ, the Apostle Paul is saying that the power of Satan has been broken over those who will come to Jesus Christ,
[time=2223] who will trust in him, and there can be a freedom from that bondage.
[time=2227] There can be a freedom from the power of Satan.
[time=2231] Paul says, "The world has been crucified to me and I to the world."
[time=2240] Since I have come to Christ, since I have lived for him, since I have experienced the power of the cross, the world has died to me.
[time=2251] Paul is saying here that the world at this stage of his life through the power of the cross no longer held any attraction to him.
[time=2261] He says that the world has died to him.
[time=2264] It no longer appealed to him. That doesn't mean that Paul wasn't tempted.
[time=2270] That doesn't mean that Paul didn't have times where he would sin.
[time=2274] But it does mean that the dominion of sin of this evil world system was no longer in control of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2282] He'd been freed by the power of the cross.
[time=2285] Through Christ and the cross, we can be freed.
[time=2291] Paul says in this verse, "I have died to the world." His way of life, his total manner, was evidenced by the fact that he lived every day as a man who had died to the world.
[time=2307] It no longer held attraction to him.
[time=2310] You know in our own feeble way as humans, we sometimes can, for a short period of time, die to the world in pursuit of a goal.
[time=2320] An Olympic runner, as he begins to train, will often take and quit his job and just spend time training and preparing and getting ready for that Olympic event.
[time=2333] And he will die to the world in that he will completely forsake the pleasures and the opportunities and he will spend his time training and running and doing the things necessary to get ready for that Olympic event.
[time=2349] I remember a time in my life when for a brief amount of time I died to the world.
[time=2355] When I was in about the seventh grade, I picked up a basketball and I decided that for the next six years, I would do whatever it took to be the very best basketball player that I could be.
[time=2367] When I was determined that if necessary, I would die to the world to accomplish that goal. And I was willing to give up things that many of the other men my age were doing and having fun doing and I spent many hours practicing and trying to improve and to develop a game.
[time=2388] It didn't work too well. My younger brother recently spoke with my high school basketball coach and he said to my brother Pearson, you know, in all the years that I coached high school basketball, your brother had less talent than anybody I ever coached.
[time=2404] You know, that hurts. You know, I don't think that's true.
[time=2411] There were only four things that kept me from greatness on the basketball floor. I couldn't run. I couldn't jump. I couldn't dribble and I couldn't shoot.
[time=2421] But other than that, I was an all-star.
[time=2426] I was so slow that one time my coach said to me, Pearson, you know, there's one good thing about being slow.
[time=2433] I said, what's that coach? He said, you never have to worry about slowing down when you get old.
[time=2440] A couple of years ago, John Madden, the sports commentator, was watching Refrigerator Perry pick up a fumble and run down the field toward the goal line.
[time=2448] And speaking of Refrigerator Perry, he looked at him and he said to the other announcer, you know, Refrigerator Perry is so slow, I'll bet it takes him two hours to watch 60 minutes.
[time=2460] That's how slow I was. We can die for a period of time. We can have a period in our life where we set our eyes on a goal.
[time=2474] But the Apostle Paul in this verse is saying, I have died to the world. It has died to me. It no longer has an attraction to me, but the important thing is the commitment of Paul goes so much deeper than an Olympic runner or a high school ball player.
[time=2489] He said, it will be my daily walk. And I will die to the world every day when he says at the end of that verse, and I to the world, he is saying that the world had deserted him.
[time=2505] It no longer was interested in him. It no longer wanted him.
[time=2512] The cross of Christ, the power to free men from slavery. Are you free from the slavery of that world system today?
[time=2520] Have you found the power of the cross in your life that enables you to walk in freedom away from the bondage of sin and the bondage of the world?
[time=2531] Oh, I pray that you have. As we move on to verse 15, Paul gives us our second point. Paul says, for neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
[time=2548] The second power of the cross of Christ is the power to make one a new creation. The cross not only freezes from the bondage of sin, but through the precious power of God's Holy Spirit, we can be made into a new creation.
[time=2564] A new person, a new being. Paul is speaking to the Galatian church, and he says, for neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
[time=2580] The Apostle Paul is speaking to the Galatians because they had a problem. Paul had evangelized them some time back. He had won the Galatians to the Lord. He had brought them the freedom of the cross, but then, as you know, from reading the book of Galatians, some people who had come in, some Jewish Christians, and they had begun to speak to the Galatians and to tell them that there was something else that was necessary
[time=2609] for salvation besides faith in Jesus Christ. They said that in addition to faith in Jesus Christ, for a person to be born again, he would have to keep the letter of the Jewish law. They would have to observe rituals and feasts and special days.
[time=2628] And the Galatian church had begun to adopt this, and the influence was growing, and Paul was upset about this. And so he writes this letter of Galatia to remember them that freedom is not in the works of the law, that freedom and salvation comes from faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2647] And through that faith, we become a new creation. Paul says circumcision or uncircumcision will not avail anything. It can do nothing to make you a new creation. It can do nothing to bring about the change in your life that we're speaking about. It can do nothing to transform you into this new being. It is only through faith in Jesus Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit
[time=2675] who comes in and cleanses us and changes us and makes us this new creation. Many men over the years and centuries have struggled with this very thing. They have tried to earn God's favor through works.
[time=2692] They have tried to earn the favor of God, they have tried to work their way to heaven, and they have overlooked what Paul says that it's not the works of the law or any type of works that we might have in our society today, it's only through a new creation.
[time=2708] John Wesley at the age of 29 was already an ordained minister in the Church of England. Wesley was unhappy. He was a professor of New Testament Greek, an ordained minister, but there was something missing in his life. He desperately wanted to please God. He desperately wanted to serve God, but he didn't know how to do it.
[time=2734] And Wesley tried to do it through a series of works. He went about him. He went to the mission field thinking he could work his way to heaven as a missionary. He thought that he could please God by some type of activity.
[time=2749] He reached a point where he was taking communion every morning of his life, seeking somehow to please God.
[time=2759] He would wake up every day and spend hours in prayer and talk to God. He said, "God, I want to please you. I want to do your will." But something wasn't there.
[time=2772] And then one night, Wesley walked into a church service on Aldersgate Street in London, England in the year 1738. And as he listened, a Moravian minister was preaching from the commentary of Martin Luther on the Epistle to the Romans.
[time=2789] And as Wesley sat and listened, the preacher spoke about the power of a new creation. He spoke about the power of being born again, of receiving Jesus Christ as Savior. And through that, becoming a new creation.
[time=2804] And Wesley wrote in his journal that at that moment, he said, "I felt that I did believe. I felt that I received Christ and that something came over me and I became a new being." John Wesley found what he had been missing, that the power for a new creation comes from the cross of Jesus Christ and not from the works of man.
[time=2827] He ran from the meeting and he ran to his brother's house, Charles. And he said, "Charles, I believe, I believe." And Charles Wesley, his brother, had found Christ just earlier that week.
[time=2839] And they rejoiced together in their newfound faith and the rest is history. John Wesley went on to found the Methodist church and he led tremendous revivals in England and tremendous revivals in America.
[time=2852] His brother Charles became the most prolific hymn writer of the Christian faith. And one day, contemplating this new creation in his life, Charles Wesley wrote this.
[time=2863] "Long my imprisoned spirit lay, fast bound in sin and nature's night, thine I diffused a quickening ray, I woke the dungeon flame with light, my chains fell off, my heart was free, I rose, went forth and followed thee, the power of a new creation, the power of Jesus Christ and the cross."
[time=2892] By way of application, I would like to speak to someone who might be here this morning. And you've been told your entire life that the way to inherit eternal life, the way to please God and to get to heaven is through a system of good works.
[time=2910] You have been taught that if you are raised and you go to school and you're a good person and you go to work every day and then you get married and you raise your family and you're faithful to them, that that someday will merit you salvation and a place in eternity.
[time=2931] Thank God you're living a righteous life. Thank God you're serving your family. You're meeting their needs. All those are all such important things. We believe in that.
[time=2942] But from the pages of Scripture, Paul is crying out today and he is saying the power to become a new creation is not through works. It's not just through any righteousness that we might accumulate here on earth. It only comes.
[time=2958] It only comes through the power of the cross to be a new creation. Martin Luther, like Wesley, was in the same situation. Luther was serving in a monastery, doing many things every day trying to please God, saying prayers and repeating them and going through all of the works of a monk seeking to please God.
[time=2983] Seeking in any way that he could, but there was no peace. It just wasn't there. He began to read his Bible and one day he came across a verse that said the just shall live by faith.
[time=2998] And he said that he began to ponder that in his mind. He began to think, what does that mean? The just shall live by faith.
[time=3009] And then one day it came to him and he realized that God was saying to him that those who are justified, those who are made righteous before God are justified by faith in him. And they live by that. And Martin Luther said, I was born again at that time and he recorded it in his memoirs and in his journal, the power of a new creation. It's not found through works.
[time=3036] This week I was thinking of my own father who passed away just a year ago this past Friday.
[time=3044] He came to America after World War II. He was a good family man. He went to work every day. He raised four children. He was a faithful husband and father.
[time=3058] He was well liked where he went to work. He was friends with everybody. If any man ever walked a good life, if any man could ever have said, I do these things and these works are good, my father could. He was a kind man.
[time=3077] I remember as a young boy when money might be tight that I would wake up on Saturday morning and my father would be gone and I'd say to my mother, where's Dad? She'd say, Jim, he left a long time ago. He went to go to work with another one of the carpenters and they're out doing some work for a person.
[time=3094] He's making some extra money. Perhaps it was Christmas. He was sacrificing. He was doing a good work to help his family.
[time=3103] My father lived for 65 years doing good works. But then, as the cancer that invaded his brain became terminal, he met one day with Pastor Rick and I, and we spoke to my father.
[time=3121] We discussed many things, but Rick explained so carefully that justification was only by faith, that we could only be born again by faith. Just a few short months before he died, my father accepted Christ as Savior one day at the kitchen table and was born again and became a new creation.
[time=3143] He never got a chance to walk the Christian life. He soon was debilitated and in a hospital bed. But as I spoke to him just three weeks before he died, I said, "Dad, do you remember what we spoke about that day at the table with Pastor Rick?" He said, "Yes."
[time=3160] I said, "Dad, what have you been thinking about?" He said, "God." He could only speak one or two words at a time. I've been thinking about God. And just three short weeks later, he went to be with that God.
[time=3176] The power unto a new creation does not come from works. It only comes from the cross and the power of the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=3191] The third point this morning is found in verse 16. Paul goes on to say, "And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God."
[time=3206] And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them. The third power of the cross actually comes and grows and is a natural rising out of the second point.
[time=3221] But the third point is the power to walk as a new creation. Not only can we be freed from the evil world system, not only can we be remade into a new creation through the power of the cross, but lastly we can have the power to walk as a new creation.
[time=3239] That means we can live and have the power to live our righteous and holy life. We don't have to walk under the bondage of sin.
[time=3250] The power to walk as a new creation is the outward manifestation of what has occurred inside of us.
[time=3260] Paul says those who will walk. That means to keep in line with. Those who will keep in line with. And then he says this rule.
[time=3270] Paul is referring back to some things that he has spoken of in the fifth chapter of Galatians. And what Paul is saying is that those who will stay in line, those who will walk in the power of the Holy Spirit, that power that has indwelt them since the time of the new creation,
[time=3287] those who will have the power to walk as a new creation and to live our righteous life.
[time=3293] The cross of Christ gives us the power to walk in the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit which we received at the time that we were born again.
[time=3304] We can walk with the Spirit controlling our lives. You don't have to turn to it. But in the fifth chapter of Galatians Paul writes about what it's like to walk without the new creation.
[time=3320] What it's like to live in the flesh. What it's like to lead a life under the bondage of the evil world system.
[time=3332] He says the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing and things like these.
[time=3348] Of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarned you that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=3355] And then he goes on to speak about the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.
[time=3362] We all have them memorized from Sunday school. But the Apostle Paul is saying that the works of the flesh have been defeated at the cross of Christ that has a new creation with the indwelling Holy Spirit.
[time=3375] We can live a life where we walk in a righteous fashion and we live for him. Yes, we will fall. We will sin.
[time=3386] And there will be times when we will need to come to Christ and to repent. But Paul is saying that that control of the flesh will no longer be in charge.
[time=3397] We can live in the power of God's Holy Spirit. Now don't misunderstand what Paul says when he says, "Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
[time=3410] That doesn't mean that if you ever sin, you lose your salvation. That doesn't mean that if you fall into some temptation, some sin that God doesn't love you anymore.
[time=3421] The key to that is found in the fact that the grammar there is a present participle. It's a dourative type of love.
[time=3431] And what God is saying is, "Those who continually and habitually practice those evil ways, those people shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
[time=3442] Oh, but he's not speaking about you or me. If you're a believer in Christ today, who is living in the power of the Holy Spirit when we stumble and fall, he says that we can be forgiven.
[time=3457] The power to walk as a new creation.
[time=3462] This came home to me so hard yesterday afternoon as I prepared this message.
[time=3468] This has been two weeks of stress, two weeks of a lot of work in our family. I was finishing up final exams at school.
[time=3476] I was trying to write several term papers and get them to various people who were typing them for me. And I was stressed out this week.
[time=3485] My wife has been carrying the burden she's been carrying the load. She's been doing it all.
[time=3493] And yesterday as I was going through the hustle and the bustle of the day, I had a moment when my son was asking me questions, "Dad, who's better? Michael Jordan or Larry Bird? Dad?"
[time=3514] We've been sharing with you the music of Christmas from our teen choir and soloist Tim Teder and Lisa Reniker. The message today was from our associate pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=3525] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3534] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful we are for this season. We are grateful that you sent your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3545] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to come in and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse me.
[time=3554] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed that prayer, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3571] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Closer Walk," please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
