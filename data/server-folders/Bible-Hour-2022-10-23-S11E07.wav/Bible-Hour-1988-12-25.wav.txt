[time=0] Father God, we come before You with hearts full of joy and rejoicing at Your Son, the
[time=9] Lord Jesus Christ, whom we do adore, who we bow before and worship as our Lord, my Savior,
[time=16] Father, we thank You for Your love that You would sing the name of time to die for us,
[time=23] and we thank You for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=26] For His ruling is to come and suffer for us, but we might live for other.
[time=31] We just ask now that Your Holy Spirit will lead us in directness on this Christmas morning
[time=37] as we come to worship You in Christ's name and pray, Amen.
[time=42] Thank You, You may be seated.
[time=45] The Book of Matthew says His name shall be called Immanuel, which being interpreted.
[time=56] I pray that You may be seated in directness on this Christmas morning as we come to worship.
[time=62] We pray that You will sing the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=79] The Book of Matthew says His name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=107] Two men crossed a field at about the same time.
[time=111] One yelled to the other, anything new on this cold morning, it was February 1809.
[time=119] The voice came back from across the field, "No, nothing ever happens in these parts." Oh, by the way, Tom Lincoln's wife, Nancy, I heard she had a baby boy.
[time=131] I think they named him Abraham.
[time=134] A world didn't notice a baby boy born in Kentucky, who was the change the course of American history.
[time=141] And a world didn't notice a baby Jesus who was born to change all of eternity.
[time=161] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. Thank you for joining us.
[time=166] Rick's message today is entitled, "Thanks be to God." Here at Blackhawk it is Christmas morning.
[time=172] Packages have been opened and the task of some assembly required is half complete.
[time=177] It is particularly meaningful that Christmas is on a Sunday this year.
[time=181] Today we have the opportunity to thank God for His undescribable gift.
[time=185] In fact, that is the title of Rick's message, "Thank God for His undescribable gift."
[time=192] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=196] Rick's text is 2 Corinthians, chapter 9, verse 15.
[time=201] Our special music today includes a solo by Kathy Hawks,
[time=207] an instrumental solo from Scott Schindler, and a solo from Kevin Rowe.
[time=214] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Blackhawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=222] We pray the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=225] Now, here's Rick.
[time=244] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=248] It's a joy to come together this morning and to see each other's faces.
[time=253] It's a particular joy for me.
[time=255] Normally on a Christmas Eve service we have two or three hundred people.
[time=259] Last night we had nearly a thousand people, and that was exciting.
[time=263] But as we drove home, Kathy and I said, "I wonder if they came last night," and said, "Merry Christmas because we won't be seeing you tomorrow, but you've come that we can worship together today." We're delighted that you're here.
[time=277] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=282] We trust that today is that we worship that you'll know that Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior.
[time=288] We have the privilege now of hearing Scott Schindler play the organ and an anthem of praise.
[time=302] [MUSIC - 189 seconds]
[time=505] [APPLAUSE]
[time=513] Music is indeed inspiring when Scott plays on our organ, we're grateful for his ability.
[time=519] Let us sing again as we sing.
[time=520] Hark the herald angels, sing him number 133, him number 133 verses one and three.
[time=529] [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=651] We trust that this service has already been an encouragement to your life, that it sparked an interest in spiritual growth.
[time=660] We're standing in front of the set of the living Christmas tree as we preach the message today and have some fond remembrances of this year's concert series.
[time=669] Rick, it's a delight to have people come in that write to us regularly and watch the Bible hour but then have them drive in from Ohio and Michigan and parts of Indiana to view the tree and then to greet us after the concerts.
[time=682] And that happened many nights as we gave 10 performances of the living Christmas tree.
[time=687] You know, there were quite a number of times that in the crowd following the service, I had a privilege meeting some of you friends who took a moment to say that you watched us regularly.
[time=697] Many people commented that we had breakfast together and by that they mean they watched the Bible hours,
[time=703] they had breakfast.
[time=704] I never got any of the good breakfast meals they talked about, but we shared those moments together.
[time=709] It was a fantastic concert series. I know the Lord was glorified.
[time=713] Thank you, Rick, and that's certainly what the choir prayed for.
[time=717] They prayed for their neighbors and friends and people that came that they would indeed see the beautiful Savior
[time=723] and the promise of the peaceful life that he gives as we accept him as personal Savior.
[time=729] And then the praise we can have in our hearts because he indeed is the Savior of the world.
[time=733] What was a great concert series and thank you for all the hard work on your part and on your team's part.
[time=739] Thanks, Rick.
[time=740] Those opportunities like the living Christmas tree are highlights for us because we meet so many friends
[time=746] that we've never shaken hands with before.
[time=749] We're in our new home, our new sanctuary, and we're sponsoring a Sunday morning open house.
[time=755] In many ways it'll be a regular Sunday morning service, but we'll do a few extra things hopefully to make it unique and we want to encourage you friends who are in the greater Fort Wayne area to consider coming and worshiping with us in person as we have an open house here at our new sanctuary.
[time=772] It'll be Sunday morning January the 29th in our new year in our new building and we'd love to meet some of you, our new friends.
[time=780] So take out your calendar. I bet somebody gave you one as a Christmas gift.
[time=784] And mark Sunday January the 29th open house at Blackhawk and we want to encourage you friends in the Fort Wayne area
[time=792] to come and join us on that day.
[time=794] Our Sunday morning services are at 9.45.
[time=797] You might want to come a few moments early and worship with us on January the 29th at 9.45 in the morning.
[time=805] As you begin a new year we want to ask you to make a new commitment to spiritual growth.
[time=811] The best tool is the Word of God and we have a helpful little tool to supplement your study of God's Word.
[time=819] It's a daily reading guide that will lead you through the New Testament in one year.
[time=824] It's titled The Closer Walk.
[time=827] It reflects the fact that each of us in this new year want to have a closer walk with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=835] That will only come through time spent together with the Lord.
[time=839] Time in prayer and time in His Word.
[time=842] And as we begin a new year perhaps you've made some resolutions that you're going to eat less and exercise more.
[time=849] Or maybe there was a habit that you consider a bad one that you're going to drop about picking up a new habit.
[time=855] A study in God's Word.
[time=857] We're not asking you to spend hours out of each day, just a few precious but powerful minutes in God's Word.
[time=864] A tool like a closer walk will help you to systematize and organize your study.
[time=869] It will pace you, it will motivate you, it will give you a target to shoot for.
[time=874] We'd like to send you a copy free to help you begin this new adventure.
[time=878] Simply by writing and asking for it, we'll send it to you as quick as we can.
[time=883] You can receive closer walk by writing to the Bible Hour.
[time=887] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=891] The zip code is 46815.
[time=894] Once again that's the Bible Hour.
[time=896] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=900] 46815.
[time=902] Thanks Pete.
[time=904] Thank you again for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=907] And we hope that you friends in the Fort Wayne area will come and join us on January the 29th for an open house at Blackhawk.
[time=915] Good morning.
[time=917] I can't think of anything that I'd rather do on a Christmas morning than spend the morning telling the Christmas story to children.
[time=923] And this morning we're going to try telling it just a little bit different than we've done before.
[time=927] And I'd like to invite the boys and girls that are on this end.
[time=929] If you'd like to just come on around and sit down here on the floor so that I can see you while I'm telling the story.
[time=935] You know, every Sunday I get an opportunity to meet with, I would say just about all of you, either in children's church or in Sunday school or possibly even one of the toddler classes.
[time=944] And every week you're an inspiration to me.
[time=947] Week after week you pro-tray to me what I should be like in my life.
[time=951] For the Bible that tells us that we are to become like children is not you who are to become like adults.
[time=957] It's your faith, simple, it's your dependence in your trust that you have that I want to try to role model in my life.
[time=964] So it's this morning during the Christmas story I plan to learn from you and not necessarily you from me.
[time=970] Would you do me a favor?
[time=971] Would you bow your heads and let's pray for one second together please before we start?
[time=975] Our Heavenly Father, thank you that with all the power that you've had in the universe and you could have chosen to have come to us in any way, you chose to come to us as a baby in a manger.
[time=987] Oh, how that gives validity and worth to the time of childhood in our lives.
[time=992] Thanks for this time that we have to get together and think about your first Christmas, your birthday.
[time=997] We ask that we will see the majesty and the ovid in our eyes today.
[time=1001] [AMEN] So if I was to ask somebody here today what they think would be the most important people in the Christmas story, who would have something to say right here?
[time=1011] She knows Mary and Joseph.
[time=1013] I think she's right.
[time=1014] Who else thinks that they have part of the Christmas story that they think would be extra important?
[time=1020] Jesus, I think she's right too.
[time=1022] One more answer.
[time=1023] See if we've got Mary and Joseph, we've got baby Jesus.
[time=1025] Did we leave anything out?
[time=1027] Right here.
[time=1029] The angel.
[time=1030] You know, I think everybody here has covered everything that we've ever heard about the Christmas story and you're right.
[time=1035] But this morning we're going to talk about a different part of the Christmas story than maybe we've ever considered before.
[time=1040] And that is that I think the Christmas story would not be complete.
[time=1044] It wouldn't be whole unless we had one more important part of the Christmas story.
[time=1049] And that is that I think that sometime in the Christmas story we need to give some recognition to the star that's shown that night.
[time=1057] It was a star, very similar to the star that I have up here, that was a big part of the Christmas story, but we never talk about it.
[time=1065] It was that star that brought the wise men to baby Jesus.
[time=1069] It was that star that made the announcement of the Christ child.
[time=1072] I'd like to take a second here and I'd like to talk with you a little bit about that star.
[time=1080] Right here in God's Word the Bible it says, and the wise man, as they were traveling, said, "Who is this?"
[time=1087] For as we have seen his star in the east, we have come to worship him.
[time=1092] The Bible also says that when the wise man heard the king, they departed in low.
[time=1097] A star that they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was.
[time=1102] And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
[time=1108] I've never thought about that, but I think that star was a pretty important part.
[time=1112] What do you suppose would have happened if we hadn't had that star on that very first Christmas?
[time=1116] What did the wise man ever found their way?
[time=1118] What do you think, Jared?
[time=1120] No, he says no, he doesn't think so.
[time=1123] Well, if I read my Bible carefully and I think about that star on the first night, I'd like you to consider some thoughts with me on that star.
[time=1131] I wonder if that star felt insignificant that very first night that it was on shining up in the sky.
[time=1138] I bet there were millions of stars out on that blessed night, and yet one star had a very important job to do of shining and shining brightly.
[time=1148] You know, he wasn't an insignificant star.
[time=1151] It was a major part of God's plan and for what God had planned for you and for me and for the eternity to come.
[time=1159] You know, I wonder if the star would have chosen to have done something different.
[time=1163] If I had been that star routinely up in the sky at night, I think I would have rather have been a wise man down in the stable.
[time=1169] I think I'd have rather been one of the animals gazing into baby Jesus' eyes, but that's not what we read in the story.
[time=1175] We read that the star was content to routinely do his shining up in the sky that night, night after night he did that, and yet it was pleasing to God.
[time=1187] You know, that star also brought a curiosity to other people.
[time=1192] It was that star that said, "Go, sick Jesus Christ. He's been born tonight." It was the indicator that something great had happened, and you know, that star could have said, "Oh, I think I'm going to choose to not do this.
[time=1205] I'm bored with what I'm doing," but he didn't. He's shown bright, and we read that in the Word this morning, didn't we?
[time=1211] You know, I thought about it this week, and I think that each one of you, in your own special way, are a lot of the star that Jesus had in the sky that night.
[time=1222] You know, do you ever feel insignificant as children?
[time=1226] Grow up.
[time=1228] Sometimes children do. I hear them say, "I can't wait till I grow older, and I can do something. I can be more special."
[time=1234] Well, I don't think that's the way it is. I think that you are significant, and that God right now, just like the star in the sky, has a very, very special plan for your life.
[time=1243] And the talents that He's given you, and the abilities that He's given you, you have to quietly and humbly do, just like that star quietly and humbly did.
[time=1251] You know, the other thing I hear children say sometimes, "Oh, I wish I was prettier. I wish I was bigger. I wish I could sing."
[time=1258] And adults do the same thing, but you know that star didn't worry about the fact that it wasn't doing maybe what it had wanted to do.
[time=1265] It just quietly and obediently did exactly what the Lord had asked Him to do on that night.
[time=1271] And you know something else? You have great power in arousing the curiosity of other people to come and find Jesus Christ.
[time=1278] Why, if that star hadn't shown on that very first night, possibly nobody would have shown up that evening.
[time=1284] You see, it wasn't integral. It was a vital part of that Christmas story.
[time=1288] And you, whether you're two, or whether you're seven, whether you're nine, whether you're five, you have an integral part to play in bringing people.
[time=1298] You see, once people meet Jesus Christ as the wise men did, their lives are never ever the same again.
[time=1304] You know, this is Christmas morning, and we're gathered together, and I bet if I ask you, you've opened up gifts.
[time=1309] Jesus is going to have two comings. One coming, He's already celebrated, and we've celebrated that this morning at our house.
[time=1316] We've opened gifts, we've taken a cart packages, we have trees that we've enjoyed, but there's going to be a second coming to Jesus Christ.
[time=1323] A second advent. Oh, one we celebrate here this morning, but the best one is yet to come.
[time=1328] For if you have Jesus Christ, as your Savior, He's going to come again, and this time He's not going to come as a baby in a manger, quiet.
[time=1336] But the next time He comes, He's going to come as ruler of the world with all the power, and He's going to set up His kingdom.
[time=1343] And you know, the day after Christmas there can be disappointment. I've seen it in children's eyes.
[time=1347] I've seen it in parent's eyes as they looked at their charge count statements after Christmas, and it's another whole year we get to celebrate Christmas.
[time=1354] But this year, tomorrow morning when you wake up, and the gifts of all been wrapped, and the packages are all opened, and some of the toys have even broken,
[time=1365] you can bank on and anticipate the fact that the best gift of very all, the second coming of Jesus Christ, is still going to happen.
[time=1374] You know what boys and girls? This could be the very year. It's something that we anticipate, and we look forward to.
[time=1380] And just as we know that in God's Word, it told us that Jesus came the first time He's going to come again, and He's going to take those of us who know us as their personal Savior home.
[time=1390] I can't believe how many of you came to church this Christmas morning to spend Christmas with me.
[time=1395] I really mean that there's nothing I'd rather do on Christmas morning than spend it with children, because you're the happiness and you're the joy of the season.
[time=1401] I'd like to wish each one of you a very Merry Christmas from the whole church, and I wish you a very blessed New Year.
[time=1407] Merry Christmas. Would you like to find your way back? Merry Christmas.
[time=1421] [MUSIC]
[time=1451] There in a manger Jesus was born, Christ has finally come. This is the theme of the song that Kevin Rowe is going to sing for us right now.
[time=1461] Let's listen as he ministers to us in song.
[time=1483] There in a manger, he was no stranger, prophesied now alive Jesus was born, the bells are ringing, people are singing.
[time=1499] Until say would joy Jesus was born, there in a manger, he was no stranger, prophesied now alive Jesus was born.
[time=1511] He hold the gift of salvation, a light for all to see, revealing all God's glory, Emmanuel is here.
[time=1527] He hold the gift of salvation, and Christ the promised one shining through the darkest Jesus Christ has come.
[time=1545] The bells are ringing, people are singing, angels say would joy Jesus was born, there in a manger, he was no stranger, prophesied now alive Jesus was born, the bells are ringing, people are singing, angels say would joy Jesus was born, there in a manger, he was no stranger, prophesied now alive Jesus was born.
[time=1574] Glory to the King, Lord of everything, Christ is finally come.
[time=1583] Glory to the King, let the people sing hallelujah, hallelujah, the bells are ringing, people are singing, angels say would joy Jesus is born, come and receive him, you can believe him.
[time=1603] Or if I'm still alive Jesus is born, the bells are ringing, people are singing, angels say with joy Jesus is born, come and receive him, you can believe him.
[time=1618] Or if I'm still alive Jesus is born, or if I'm still alive Jesus is born, or if I'm still alive Jesus is born.
[time=1644] Good morning, my name is Dick Rowe, Kevin happens to be related to me.
[time=1652] I'm pretty new Christian even though I'm not very new in age, and I want to give my testimony today.
[time=1661] I kind of grew up in a decent home, my parents didn't go to church much, but they did encourage me to go to Sunday school, and I did when I was a child, I went, my grandfather drove me down, and I'd go to Sunday school, and then I'd walk home and he'd stay for church, I never went to church much.
[time=1681] I thought I was a pretty good guy, I got into Sunday school because we had a lot of fun, the boys class, we went around to the lion swam, we played basketball and did all kinds of things, I had picnics in the summertime, and it was fun, but I guess I didn't listen to any of the messages, I didn't learn the gospel message, and I really should have, but I didn't.
[time=1709] I finally got drafted, I went in the army, and I drifted away from even that amount of church.
[time=1715] Afterwards, I came home and I met my future wife, and we started to go to church, she was a believer, and I went to church for quite a while, and then as we moved out of town and I got some children in the house, we kind of thought it was hard to get up in the morning on Sunday and come to church, and we didn't come much.
[time=1737] And off and on we'd drift in and out of church, and I think I was kind of what Dave Norton, I heard him call a hang around Christian, I hung around church, and Christians, but I didn't participate, I didn't partake of anything, I didn't go out of my way to try to get acquainted with other Christians, and I just stayed away from it.
[time=1759] We had a pretty good life, they had a good job, they never was without work, they made a reasonably good living, and I was satisfied.
[time=1769] I finally, when our youngest son Kevin got to be in high school, he started to come to Blackhawk, and I think he came with a Kessler family, they encouraged him to come, and he became a Christian.
[time=1785] And I started to watch the way Kevin acted, I watched his friends that he had, he started to bring kids into the house with afterglows after the college and career class, in fact that's where I met Rick and Kathy because he was a youth pastor at that time.
[time=1802] And I watched around and I hung around again for quite a while, about ten years, and I finally decided that after I saw the way Kevin behaved, we never worried about what Kevin did when he was out away from home, we knew he was with a good crowd, we knew he was behaving, didn't have to worry about him, and it was really a comfort to us.
[time=1824] And I finally decided that I really needed something in my life, besides just the work in the home, and I told my wife that I'd bring her to church, and we'd come every Sunday if she wanted to.
[time=1838] And we started to come, and I think it was really me, I wanted to come to church, I wasn't being a nice guy, I needed it, and I came myself.
[time=1846] And I started to read the Bible, and I finally came to Jesus through Rick's help, he came over to my house one night, part of evangelism explosion on a Wednesday evening in November of 1985, just three years ago.
[time=1861] So I came to the Lord at a very tender age of 59, and it's never too late, and I found that out, that in Matthew 20 verse 1 to 16, the Lord tells a parable about the workers in the vineyard, where they are paid the same no matter whether they work one hour or twelve or nine or six or whatever it is,
[time=1886] he's willing to pay, and his generosity and love is available to all of us, no matter how late we come to Christ.
[time=1892] And I didn't encourage anyone to come to Christ, no matter how old they are, it's never too late until you die.
[time=1898] I thought I was a good guy, and God wouldn't make me go to hell, but I didn't really know the gospel, I have to come to Christ to come to God.
[time=1906] And that's the only way, it's through Christ. Christ has meant a lot to me. I had a heart attack last February, and I think the only thing that really got me through that was my belief.
[time=1921] Before I went to the hospital, I prayed to God, and I said, "God, it's in your hands, whatever you want to do, it's up to you, I'm turning it over to you, and I'm not going to worry about it."
[time=1931] And I didn't, I was very peaceful, the whole time I was in the hospital, I've gotten along very well since then, and things come up at work or whatever it is.
[time=1940] I turn it over to the Lord, and it's made my life much better than it ever has been before.
[time=1947] And he's given me a peace, and I know that I will be with him later, because he said I would, if I come to him and confess my sins and ask for forgiveness.
[time=1957] Thank you.
[time=1962] Thank you, Dick. It's a real profile and courage when a man will look into an audience and say, "At age 59, I gave my heart to Jesus Christ."
[time=1972] You know, there are many of us as men that we only have one obstacle that stands between us and eternity, between our life and receiving Jesus Christ as Savior, that obstacle is our own pride.
[time=1987] There's a hymn that says, "years I spent in vanity and pride, caring not. My Lord was crucified."
[time=1995] Do you know today that the Jesus whose birth we celebrate died on the cross for your sins?
[time=2000] And men, it's a step of courage to say, "I will receive him." I'm thankful for Kevin's life, that out of character, a father would see the Son of God in his own son.
[time=2011] Our father, we thank you today for the Lord Jesus Christ, and we gather on this Christmas morning to worship him.
[time=2018] We praise you for your undescribable gift, and that through the birth of Christ, there's opportunity for us to be born again.
[time=2027] We pray today that Jesus Christ would be known in this congregation, and that there would come out of this body of people, a generation of men and women who would not be ashamed to name the name of Christ.
[time=2041] And so as we meet today, we ask you to meet with us so that we might sense your power in our lives.
[time=2048] We pray today for those who are walking through difficult valleys.
[time=2052] We pray for families that are fractured this morning, particularly those that have been broken over this past year.
[time=2060] That may be something of the message of Christ would penetrate a heart and bring healing.
[time=2066] We pray for parents who are hurting this morning because their children, though grown, are walking in rebellion to you.
[time=2075] We pray for those who are involved in substance abuse, that this day they might discover that there's one who will give life and give it more abundantly.
[time=2085] We pray for those who've lost loved ones in recent days, and particularly pray for the family of Bill Civitz, that in these days they'll sense that those absent from them that he is present with you.
[time=2097] And now as we open your word, we hope today to know more of Jesus, for it's in his name that we pray, Amen.
[time=2110] It was a cold February morning. The winds blew briskly across the field in northern Kentucky.
[time=2118] Two men crossed an opposite sides of the field and gestured one to the other with a wave and a nine.
[time=2125] One shouted out, "Anything new in town?" No came the reply from the other side of the field. Nothing ever happens in these parts.
[time=2136] Then with a moment of reflection, he said, "Oh, by the way, Tom Lincoln's wife Nancy had a baby boy.
[time=2143] I think they named him Abraham." The world didn't notice the birth of a little boy in Kentucky whose life would alter all of American history.
[time=2155] The world didn't notice the birth of a baby boy in Bethlehem whose life would alter all of eternity.
[time=2164] Does it really matter today that Jesus was born? Does it really make a difference in my life that Christ came at Bethlehem?
[time=2175] Does it really matter today if I live for him? Does it really make a difference if I order my life to please the Lord Jesus?
[time=2186] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it to 2 Corinthians, not a typical Christmas passage but one that fits the season.
[time=2194] 2 Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 10.
[time=2199] As we read the scriptures this morning, I would like to suggest to you that your life can make a difference.
[time=2206] And that your life as a believer in Jesus Christ has already made a difference.
[time=2210] Dick, I could give no better introduction than introduction that you gave today to say that I saw a son give his life to Christ.
[time=2218] I saw the character of his friends and it led me to a conclusion that Jesus Christ must be real.
[time=2224] It can make a difference in your life today.
[time=2227] In chapter 8 of 2 Corinthians it says, "You know the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor,
[time=2238] that you through his poverty might become rich." That introduces us to a concept of a cycle, a cycle of blessing.
[time=2248] And I use that word with somewhat tongue in cheek today because there are words that we use in Christianity so often that they become almost meaningless words like special.
[time=2259] Everything is special and then everything is a blessing. But yet that word has great meaning.
[time=2265] It comes from the Latin word "beitas" which means that one who is happy of heart.
[time=2270] That one whose life is rich and full on the inside, regardless of the circumstances on the outside, there's one who is "beitas" and the beatitudes speak of that happy life, that one who is blessed.
[time=2285] And here in this passage of Corinthians chapter 9, the second epistle, we come to a cycle.
[time=2292] And I would hope this morning you would see the four phases of God's cycle of blessing.
[time=2297] 2 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 10.
[time=2301] Now he, God, who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
[time=2314] You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion.
[time=2322] And through us, your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
[time=2328] This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people, but also overflowing in many expressions of thanksgiving to God.
[time=2339] Here Paul gives by explanation that four phase cycle of blessing.
[time=2346] It begins with the person of God himself.
[time=2349] Verse 10 tells us, "Now he, God, who supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply your every need."
[time=2360] In that concept of seed and bread, he's introducing us to a cycle that people of that day would understand very clearly.
[time=2369] The farmer would go out and he would sow seed, and as he would plant that seed into the ground, with his mind, he would understand that someday that seed will become bread, but it won't become bread till it goes through its cycle.
[time=2384] First, it is sown in the ground as seed. That's the work of the farmer. That farmer cares for it and grows into a stalk with a full head of grain.
[time=2394] Then the farmer goes out and he pulls the grain out in a harvest, and then the grain is delivered to the second stage of its cycle.
[time=2403] Then he goes to the miller, that one who would crush it and thrash it and winnow it and turn it in to a powder that we would now call flour.
[time=2412] Then the flour would be taken from the miller to the baker. The baker would take it and add his other ingredients and he would turn the flour in the bread, and then the bread would be sold.
[time=2425] Between there were about 16 commissioned salesman, but that was the basic cycle of how the bread was developed from the farmer.
[time=2434] These agrarians would understand that cycle. Now Paul uses that by way of illustration to say there is a cycle, and the cycle begins with God himself, just as he provides seed that becomes bread, God will supply your needs.
[time=2451] Philippians tells us that he will do that according to his riches in Christ Jesus. God will supply our needs. That's phase one, cycle God gives to us.
[time=2465] He gives to us financially, he gives to us emotionally, he gives to us in spiritual gifts in every way God gives to us. Then we receive that gift and we possess it.
[time=2478] You may possess a gift this morning like Linda Pearson to be able to work with children. I see that many children and I dial 911. That is an emergency.
[time=2488] I've never understood why they didn't give the parents of more than one children a little thing to hang on their mirror that said handicapped. I don't know of a greater handicap than taking three kids in diapers anywhere.
[time=2501] Linda's been given a gift of working with children. Kevin can come and stand on the age and sing. His father sat next to me and I said, "Dick you're in for no treat sitting next to me in this hymn." He said, "You aren't either. Kevin didn't get his voice from me."
[time=2517] Kevin has that gift. It's been given to him. You've been given gifts. Some of them are natural. Some of them have been acquired. Some of them are spiritual.
[time=2527] You've been given a gift of financial resources. All that you possess, it's come from God. He originated it and he gave it to us.
[time=2538] Then as the cycle continues into a next phase, God gives it to us so that we can give it away. So that as he gives to us, we then cycle it.
[time=2549] Here Paul was talking to the Corinthians about collecting financial resources that be sent to the Church of Jerusalem so that these people in Corinth could complete part of the cycle by giving what God had given them away.
[time=2566] "And your generosity," he says, "will result in a ministry, verse 12, a service to supply for the needs of God's people."
[time=2577] That's the third phase. God originates it. Secondly, He gives it to us. Then thirdly, we are the dispensers of it. We give it out.
[time=2586] And then finally, the cycle is completed with the fourth phase. It said three times. Then thanksgiving back to God.
[time=2597] There's a cycle. God gives it. He gives it to us. We give it out in the way of ministry. The people who receive the ministry turn around and they give the praise back to God.
[time=2607] And that's God's cycle of blessing. Now in this passage, He then takes opportunity in verse 13 having explained the cycle to elaborate on it, verse 13.
[time=2620] Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the Gospel of Christ and for your generosity in sharing with them.
[time=2635] And with everyone else. And in their prayers for you, their hearts will go out to you because of the surpassing grace God has given you.
[time=2646] Thanks be to God for His undescribable gift. Now Paul becomes specific. He repeats the cycle, but he says as you not only speak of the Gospel, but as you complete the cycle and dispense it,
[time=2662] you are the occasion for many to bring an offering of praise to God. Does it make a difference if you live for Jesus? Oh, it makes a difference.
[time=2673] Because you see God has ordained a cycle that He reaches people through people, through people who would tell about the Lord Jesus Christ, through people who would invest in the mission,
[time=2685] through people who would help build a living Christmas tree, through people who would rock a baby at this very moment in the nursery so that you could hear today.
[time=2695] Yes, it makes a difference if you live for Christ.
[time=2699] This morning, I'd like to just talk about our church and the difference that you have made. If you're a visitor this morning, please don't understand.
[time=2708] I'm not about to embark on a voyage of praise for this organization, but we simply want to take a moment to recognize on this day that God gave His Son and He initiated a cycle and we have a responsibility.
[time=2723] And at the end of a year as a pastor to people, I want to say thank you for living for Jesus Christ.
[time=2730] Five years ago, this church embarked upon a mission. That mission was to double our giving to missions, not just to ministry here in Fort Wayne, through Black Hawk, to actually double our giving to missions in five years.
[time=2748] We embarked on a plan as a board and as a staff, and we outlined it, and come this January, we will complete that five years of doubling our giving to missions.
[time=2759] But we weren't able to double that in five years. By God's grace, instead of it going up two times, it will go up two and a half times.
[time=2768] But it wasn't enough that we would send our financial resources, would we send our people.
[time=2775] Eight years ago, one missionary had come out of this church, one. Ruth Yoko, she's still serving the Lord Jesus and the hard-struck country of Bangladesh.
[time=2786] I don't have an exhaustive list, but over these past years, let me tell you some of the others who have come out of this church.
[time=2792] Brad and D. Ball are serving today in Panama with Overseas Servicemen Center.
[time=2798] Mike and Carolyn Ballist are in Manila. Lori E. B. Hun is with Youth for Christ.
[time=2804] Doug and Tammy Crane just finished their work in Africa.
[time=2807] The Faulkners have just returned this year from Peru.
[time=2810] Mary Carus is on her second term in Okinawa, Japan.
[time=2814] Lori Sel is home just for the holidays working on mercy ships around South America.
[time=2820] The Lesperances have just left us, the train to go to France.
[time=2824] Denny and Debbie Howard have been in Japan, or excuse me, in Germany and they've returned to work with you for Christ here in our community.
[time=2831] The Johnsons went into Christian camping are now on our staff.
[time=2835] The Serbals worked behind the Iron Country and with international students before returning to Fort Wayne.
[time=2841] Out of this body of people, there would come. A new generation that says, "We will live for Christ."
[time=2848] We'll not only send our money, but we'll send our sons and we'll send our daughters.
[time=2853] Every year, for the past six years, somewhere between four and ten of our high school and college students have taken their summer to give it to missions.
[time=2862] This past year, 31 people were sent out by this church and this Sunday morning, there is a meeting in New Forest of a church that was established because you live for Christ.
[time=2874] Does it make a difference? Oh, it makes a difference when you live for Christ.
[time=2879] This past year, we celebrated ten years of super-60s.
[time=2884] God would begin with George and Mary Lantman and we opened up the Convocation Center on that first Friday morning, 35 people crowded their way into that auditorium.
[time=2895] It was room to grow, but in ten years, over 3,000 senior adults have heard the ministry of compassion and of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2907] Hundreds and hundreds of them have come to know them as Savior.
[time=2911] These are people, as Dick mentioned this morning, who are near that end of life and they only have this life to know Christ.
[time=2921] And for them, time is measured, not in scores or in decades, but in years.
[time=2927] Alva Watson put it this way. If you don't know Alva, you've missed somebody.
[time=2931] Alva said that when he was 91 of his sisters died and they all sat around and they talked about who would be next, and then a brother died and they sat around and talked about who would be next.
[time=2942] Then he looked at the audience of super-60s and said, "I'm 98. I know who's next."
[time=2949] You know, there comes that reality of life that our days are numbered, and yet there has to be ministry of compassion and through super-60s.
[time=2958] This past 10th anniversary, people from 160 different churches came and heard the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2966] There are those who work with children.
[time=2969] Those who tell others about the Lord Jesus Christ, Linda emphasized the importance of children today.
[time=2976] Do you know that when you tell a children, a child about Christ, you've already won a missionary?
[time=2982] Rachel came to Christ mostly through the influence of ministry in our church.
[time=2988] At the ripe old age of six years old, she cornered her little brother.
[time=2992] At the age of four, he gave his heart to Christ.
[time=2995] I don't know what it means when a four-year-old gives his heart to Christ, but I'm thankful that a sister would be prepared of life to tell others about Christ.
[time=3004] It makes a difference when you teach a Sunday school class and you give your life for Christ.
[time=3009] It doesn't make a difference when you come and you build a living Christmas tree, and you put steel together and you put plywood stands and you cover it with artificial trees, and the computer blinks and men rush.
[time=3022] It doesn't make a difference.
[time=3024] You worked on a living Christmas tree.
[time=3027] A man last January gave his heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=3031] He influenced a friend to start coming to this church.
[time=3034] The friend would come.
[time=3036] He would hear the gospel, but he sat in these pews when the living Christmas tree lit up and gave his heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=3044] Does it make a difference that you sang in the 10th concert when your voice would hurt?
[time=3050] Oh, it makes a difference.
[time=3053] Does it make a difference that a baby boy was born in Bethlehem?
[time=3057] It makes all the difference not only in the world, but in eternity.
[time=3061] Does it make a difference when you give your heart to Christ and live for him and you walk in obedience with a difference it makes?
[time=3073] After that elaboration where Paul said, "You've made a difference." He then comes to the great, exultation.
[time=3081] Explanation, elaboration, exultation.
[time=3085] One of the clearest, most concise verses, scripture, chapter 9, verse 15.
[time=3093] And thanks be unto God for his undescribable gift.
[time=3101] You see, had God not given his son Jesus Christ, the cycle would have never started.
[time=3108] My life would have changed.
[time=3111] Yours would have never come to Jesus Christ.
[time=3114] Does it make a difference if you teach Sunday school, sing in the choir, serve as a missionary, give to the resources financially?
[time=3123] Oh, what a difference it makes.
[time=3126] Oh, God, today, we bow before you, and we want to thank you for your undescribable gift.
[time=3134] We want to thank you for people who've labored in that cycle, but this morning.
[time=3138] We know that we want to praise your name.
[time=3142] We want to sing hallelujah and shout with the angels, "Glory in excelsis dale.
[time=3148] Glory to God in the highest." We worship you, Lord Jesus, your love, your grace.
[time=3155] It goes beyond all measure.
[time=3158] It is undescribable.
[time=3160] We praise you today, and we give you this hour of worship as our praise, our gratitude, even so.
[time=3171] Come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[time=3173] Thank you, Heavenly Father, for your undescribable gift and people who will complete the cycle.
[time=3182] I dreamed I went to heaven, and you were there with me.
[time=3198] We walked upon the streets of bull, beside the crystal sea.
[time=3206] We heard the angels sing, and someone called your name.
[time=3213] We turned, and then we saw someone smiling as she came.
[time=3221] And she said, "Friend, you may not know me now." But then she said, "Just wait.
[time=3230] You used to teach my Sunday school when I was only late.
[time=3238] We used to say a little prayer before each glass would start.
[time=3245] And one time when you said that prayer, I asked Jesus in my heart,
[time=3253] and I say thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=3263] I am a life that was changed.
[time=3270] Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=3278] Now you're so glad you gave.
[time=3284] Then another stood before you and said, "Remember the time."
[time=3292] A missionary came to your church.
[time=3296] His pictures made you cry.
[time=3300] You didn't have much money, but you gave it anyway.
[time=3307] God took that fifth year game, and that's why I'm here today.
[time=3316] And she said, "Friend, you, forgive me to the Lord."
[time=3326] I am a life that was changed.
[time=3332] Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=3341] I am so glad you gave.
[time=3348] One by one they came, as far as the eye could see.
[time=3355] Each life was somehow touched by your generosity.
[time=3363] Little things that you have done and sacrifice is made.
[time=3370] I noticed, on the earth, in heaven now proclaim.
[time=3380] I know up in heaven, you're not supposed to cry.
[time=3388] I'm almost sure there are tears in your eyes,
[time=3396] as Jesus took your hand, and you stood before the Lord.
[time=3403] He said, "Look around my child, great is your Lord."
[time=3412] Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=3422] I am a life that's been changed.
[time=3429] Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=3438] I am so glad you gave.
[time=3444] And I thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=3454] I am a life that's been changed.
[time=3461] Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=3470] I am so glad you gave.
[time=3512] We have been sharing with you today music of the Savior.
[time=3517] Our organ solo was from Scott Schindler.
[time=3522] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3525] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3534] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for the celebration of Jesus' birth.
[time=3540] For the reason that He came to die on the cross for our sins.
[time=3545] Today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3549] I ask you to cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3554] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3562] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
