[time=112] While visiting in Great Britain, D.L. Moody overheard a conversation.
[time=117] And by the name of Henry Varley said, "The world is yet to see what God can do in and with and through
[time=126] a man who is wholly consecrated to him."
[time=132] When Moody heard those words, he was pricked to the heart.
[time=136] And he said to himself, "By God's grace, I'll be that man." D.L. Moody pledged in his heart that he would not sleep each day in Toy told somebody about Christ.
[time=147] There were nights when Moody went to bed, realized he had never told anyone about Christ, got up, got dressed, and went out and Toy found one person he could tell about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=158] Today, Moody Bible Institute is the longest-standing Christian school dedicated to the foundation of the scriptures on which it was begun.
[time=170] What could God do through your life if you were wholly consecrated to him?
[time=175] (music playing)
[time=188] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study, Music, and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=193] Thank you for joining us.
[time=195] Rick's message today is entitled, "New Adventures." This is 1989, a new year's before us.
[time=204] The world is looking for someone to show what the Lord can do through an individual who is wholly consecrated to him.
[time=212] This is not a time for silly resolutions, but a serious resolve.
[time=217] A new opportunity is before us.
[time=219] God is calling us to new adventures.
[time=222] We invite you to study with us today as Rick speaks about new adventures.
[time=229] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Joshua, chapter 14.
[time=235] We will be looking at verses 6 through 14.
[time=239] Our special music today will be provided by celebration and Chris Bone.
[time=246] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=255] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=259] Now, here's Rick.
[time=261] Old morning and worship together.
[time=263] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=269] On this first day, first Sunday of a new year, we have an opportunity to meet together to declare that the priority of our life is serving Jesus Christ.
[time=279] We're delighted that you're here, that we can worship together.
[time=282] And as we begin a new year, it's a new adventure of serving Jesus Christ.
[time=287] This morning celebration will lead us in much of our singing, Chris Bone's going to sing as well.
[time=292] But as we listen to music, we hope that it grabs your heart and focuses your attention on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=300] [MUSIC - 136 seconds]
[time=441] (audience applauds) - Thank you, celebration.
[time=448] Let's continue our singing now by turning to him number 135.
[time=452] Him number 135.
[time=454] We will sing all five stanzas.
[time=457] (gentle music)
[time=466] (singing in foreign language)
[time=556] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=620] - Thank you for your singing this morning.
[time=626] Last Chris Bone to come forward now and sing for us.
[time=629] She'll be singing a medley of carols all centered around joy to the world.
[time=633] (bright music)
[time=645] [MUSIC - 146 seconds]
[time=793] - Hello and welcome to a brand new year.
[time=811] I'm looking forward to 1989 with great enthusiasm and anticipation.
[time=818] I hope there's that same expectation in your life.
[time=821] My good friend and partner in ministry, Peter Koby is in California, visiting family, enjoying a 25th anniversary, and probably about right now he is headed for Colorado Boulevard and the Rose Bowl Parade.
[time=834] He's enjoying a well-deserved rest after the living Christmas tree.
[time=839] I'm thankful that you've joined us today for this hour of Bible study and music.
[time=844] As a new year begins, I hope you'll approach it with serious resolve, not just the new year's resolutions that we make that we're gonna change some little habit in our life, and we know we'll really keep that habit going in two or three days, put a deep and abiding resolve to make this year count for Jesus Christ.
[time=865] I know of no better way than to develop the personal daily discipline of being in his word.
[time=872] As a pastor, it's not unusual for people to ask me questions about how to have a daily, meaningful time in the Bible, and I find that as they tell me their struggles and their problem, it's usually a lack of discipline and a lack of direction.
[time=889] I can't mail you discipline.
[time=891] If I could, I would.
[time=892] I'd probably save a bunch of it for myself, but I'd share a little with you.
[time=897] But I can send you in the mail direction.
[time=900] Too many of us come to the Bible.
[time=901] We open it up, we don't know where to begin, what to read, so we just go to a familiar spot, and we read that today, and we read the next chapter after that spot tomorrow, and in three days we've lost direction.
[time=914] A pamphlet by the name of Closer Walk will give you the direction that you need.
[time=920] Closer Walk is a daily Bible study tool that will give you exactly what you need.
[time=926] A reading guard, a chart, a guide through the scriptures.
[time=931] If you'll subscribe to Closer Walk, you'll read through the New Testament in one year.
[time=936] Each day as you begin your daily quiet time, it'll tell you what the read middle will move you systematically through the scriptures.
[time=944] We'd like to send you a copy.
[time=946] So at the beginning of this new year, you can resolve to make your life count for Jesus Christ by being a man or woman of the word of God.
[time=956] If you'd like a copy, simply write to us today, and we'll send you your first month's issue free as a gift from us to you.
[time=965] Just simply write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=975] Our zip code is 46815.
[time=979] Again, our address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=993] Right now, I'd like to give a special invitation to you friends who watch the Bible hour here in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=1001] Coming up on Sunday morning, January the 29th, we're having what we're calling an open house.
[time=1007] We're in our new sanctuary, and it's now finished.
[time=1010] When we opened it, we had carpet delay and cabinets to finish, and 100 details to track down.
[time=1015] But it's substantially complete now.
[time=1017] And we're opening our doors and opening our hearts to this community.
[time=1021] And we want to invite you to venture out on January the 29th for our morning worship services.
[time=1028] Coming up on January the 15th, we're moving from one worship hour to two to accommodate the friends who will be joining us in the months ahead.
[time=1036] Our two services are at 9.15 in the morning and 10.50.
[time=1041] And I personally want to invite you to rise up, get out of bed, and get moving on January the 29th, and join us here at Blackhawk for our open house at 9.15 or 10.50.
[time=1053] Now as we go back to our morning worship service, we have the privilege of hearing again from the music group's celebration as they lead us in praise and worship.
[time=1062] Thanks for being a part of the Bible hour today.
[time=1065] [MUSIC]
[time=1074] Lord of all, the heights where faith can lift the trust
[time=1101] be all, Lord of all, where the depths of fear
[time=1112] would tear such faith upon you.
[time=1119] Lord of all of the nations quick to anger bearing on.
[time=1131] Lord of all, of each child held by its mothers safe from heart.
[time=1144] Lord of all of all, of all seen and unseen things of a universe
[time=1156] that sings and calls you, Lord of all.
[time=1163] Lord of all, of the power not to sing.
[time=1173] You have always been and always will be, Lord of all.
[time=1186] Lord of all, of a piece that we can draw with every breath.
[time=1203] Lord of all, of provision for each need in life and death.
[time=1215] Lord of all, of the turnings of the seasons and the earth.
[time=1230] Lord of all, of the love that purchase men a second birth.
[time=1245] Lord of all, of all seen and unseen things of a universe
[time=1257] that sings and calls you, Lord of all.
[time=1264] Lord of all, of the power not to sing.
[time=1274] You have always been and always will be, Lord of all.
[time=1304] Lord of all, of the power not to sing.
[time=1310] You have always been and always will be, Lord of all.
[time=1334] Our God and Father, we bow before you today as Lord of all.
[time=1351] Lord of seen and unseen things, you have always been and will always be, Lord of all.
[time=1361] We come to worship you today, Lord Jesus, on this day that marks a new year.
[time=1368] We want to mark today as a day of a new adventure, of a new commitment to you.
[time=1374] We thank you for your blessing in the past year and for working in and through us, but
[time=1380] we come today to pledge ourselves at the beginning of this new year, to serving you with a new and fresh heart, to serve you wholeheartedly.
[time=1391] We come to this place today to consecrate ourselves to you and to sing and to say that
[time=1397] you are Lord, not only of this world, but that you are Lord of our lives.
[time=1402] As a believer today, I pledge myself to serving you this year.
[time=1409] We ask your spirit to move in this place that there would be hearts today that would say
[time=1415] Jesus will be the Lord of my life in 1989.
[time=1421] Father today, we want you to be glorified and magnified.
[time=1425] We pray that your spirit would speak to the innermost heart of each of us, that we might know even as we are known, that you would reveal to us today those stubborn habits,
[time=1437] the sin that so easily entangles us, those points of Achilles' heel in our lives where
[time=1445] we are vulnerable and refresh us in your word.
[time=1451] And so at this new year, we commit ourselves anew to you, in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1462] On a trip to Great Britain, D.O. Moody overheard a conversation.
[time=1469] A man by the name of Henry Varley was speaking, Varley said, "The world is yet to see what
[time=1478] God can do in and with and through a man who is wholly consecrated to him."
[time=1488] Moody heard those words, and in the quietness of his own heart, he said, "By God's grace,
[time=1499] I'll be that man." D.O. Moody returned to America and was one of the greatest revival preachers in the history
[time=1508] of the world.
[time=1510] He made a pledge, simple but bold, that he would not lay himself down to rest at the
[time=1516] end of a day until he had told at least one person about Jesus Christ.
[time=1522] In Moody's writings, he tells that on more than one occasion, he went to bed only to be troubled by the Spirit of God that reminded him of his pledge, and on that day, he had not yet shared Christ with a person.
[time=1534] And Moody would get up, get dressed, and walk the streets of Chicago so he could find a man or a woman who he could tell about Jesus Christ.
[time=1543] Over 100 years ago, the Moody Bible Institute was established.
[time=1548] It is the longest running and lasting Bible college in America that still today teaches
[time=1554] the foundational principles on which it was founded.
[time=1559] The world was looking to see what God could do through a person who was wholly consecrated
[time=1568] to him.
[time=1569] Well, Henry Varley was not right, the world had seen.
[time=1574] They had seen it in a man by the name of Caleb.
[time=1578] Three times the scriptures tell us that Caleb was a man who was wholly consecrated to the
[time=1584] Lord.
[time=1585] This is New Year's Day, and we have a great opportunity that's ahead of us.
[time=1591] I'm thankful that God gives us seasons in life that mark the end of one era and the beginning
[time=1597] of another.
[time=1599] I was always thankful when a year of school had passed by, and I had passed.
[time=1604] I knew that I never had to go that way again.
[time=1606] There were a few years that school had ended, and I had not passed that mark.
[time=1612] But this is the end of a year, 88 is gone.
[time=1616] It may be in your life a great year of victory.
[time=1619] It may be a year of significant accomplishment.
[time=1622] It may be a year of setback, of adversity, of lost opportunity.
[time=1628] It has ended.
[time=1630] It has gone.
[time=1632] And God gives us a new opportunity for new adventures.
[time=1637] If you have a Bible today, I would direct your attention initially to Joshua 14, because
[time=1644] in the life of Caleb I found a man who discovers new adventures in life.
[time=1651] It was four years ago we did a study in the summer months of lives of the scripture, and
[time=1657] we looked at Caleb.
[time=1659] I don't expect you to remember that study, but I would like to take the liberty of reminding you of some of the things we set about Caleb four years ago to set a stage for you to see
[time=1669] a man who's committed to new adventures.
[time=1674] Joshua 14, verse 6.
[time=1677] Now the men of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb, the son of Jafuna, the
[time=1684] kesenite, said to him, "You know what the Lord said to Moses, the man of God at Kedish
[time=1692] Barnia, about you and me." I was 40 years old when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kedish Barnia to
[time=1703] explore the land, and I brought him back a report according to my convictions.
[time=1709] My brothers, who went up with me, made the hearts of the people melt with fear.
[time=1715] I, however, followed the Lord, my God, wholeheartedly.
[time=1722] So on that day, Moses swore to me, the land on which your feet have walked will be your
[time=1728] inheritance, and that of your children forever, because you have followed the Lord, my God,
[time=1736] wholeheartedly.
[time=1738] Now then, just as the Lord promised, He has kept me alive for forty-five years since the
[time=1745] time He said to Moses, while Israel moved about in the desert.
[time=1750] So here I am today, eighty-five years old.
[time=1754] I'm still as strong as the day Moses sent me out.
[time=1758] I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.
[time=1764] Now, give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day.
[time=1770] You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and
[time=1778] fortified, but the Lord, helping me, I will drive them out just as He said.
[time=1787] And Joshua blessed Caleb, son of Jafuna, and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
[time=1794] So Hebron has belonged to Caleb, the son of Jafuna, the kesonite, ever since, because
[time=1800] he followed the Lord, God of Israel, wholeheartedly.
[time=1808] There was a man who followed the Lord wholeheartedly.
[time=1814] By way of review of our study years ago, we talked about Caleb and the anatomy of a visionary.
[time=1821] Early in his life, Caleb was an individual who had great vision.
[time=1827] There is a line that Shakespeare puts in the mouth of Julius Caesar.
[time=1834] Caesar declares this, "There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood
[time=1842] lead on to fortune omitted all of life has spent in the shallows and misery."
[time=1853] Caleb was one of those men who took life at its flood, seized opportunity because he was
[time=1859] a man of great vision.
[time=1861] By way of definition, out of Caleb's life, back in Numbers, chapters 13 and 14, where
[time=1867] we first meet him, there is a portrayal of the anatomy of a divisionary.
[time=1872] Four things about that anatomy.
[time=1875] A visionary is a person with a perspective of adventure, a perspective of adventure.
[time=1882] A visionary sees the opportunity when everyone else sees the obstacles.
[time=1890] Back in Numbers, chapter 13, Caleb and Joshua go out, they spy out the land, and Caleb
[time=1897] comes back with the eyes of adventure.
[time=1900] And he sees the opportunity, and his report is this, it is a great land.
[time=1907] It is a land flowing with milk and with honey.
[time=1911] It's a land where the grapes are this big, and he brought them some back to show them.
[time=1916] He saw the opportunity.
[time=1918] He saw it when everybody else saw the obstacles.
[time=1924] Along with Joshua, he saw those opportunities.
[time=1928] But the ten other spies said, "Wait a minute.
[time=1933] When we went into that land, there were five different nations there, five of them, and
[time=1940] were but one.
[time=1942] And amongst those five nations, there were the anachim, the giants, and they were telling
[time=1948] the truth.
[time=1949] These were the ancestors of Goliath, who stood over nine foot tall, and the ten spies said,
[time=1958] "We can't go up and face them." The odds are five to one, and the size is two to one.
[time=1966] We can't go up there.
[time=1968] And the rest of them said it, "And everybody in that land is a giant." Now everybody in that land was not a giant.
[time=1976] They tended to exaggerate.
[time=1979] It's human nature.
[time=1980] Whenever we have a problem, we see the problem, we assess it, and then we become discouraged by it, and we see it as an all-encompassing problem.
[time=1987] There were giants, but not everyone was a giant.
[time=1991] Caleb and Joshua alone were the ones who saw the opportunity.
[time=1996] In the anatomy of a visionary, he also had the perspective of confidence.
[time=2003] Everyone else was saying, "We can't do it." Joshua said, in Numbers 1330, "We can take the land." Everyone else said, "We are, but grasshoppers in our own eyes, and so were we in their
[time=2017] eyes." That's one of my favorite verses of the Bible, tells us so much about human nature.
[time=2024] You see, these people saw themselves as grasshoppers, and as soon as they started seeing
[time=2030] themselves as grasshoppers, they began to act like a grasshopper, and pretty soon their enemies saw them as a grasshopper.
[time=2038] You remember back to your high school days, and every high school has a mascot.
[time=2044] At my high school, we were the Cahoga Falls black tigers.
[time=2049] We used to march around, "We are the tigers, the mighty, mighty tigers.
[time=2052] We are the tigers." And we'd play Kathy's home school, and they were the north Vikings, and they were these fierce warriors, and the tigers met the Vikings.
[time=2060] Have you ever been to a high school that says, "We are the grasshoppers, the hoppy-hoppy
[time=2066] grasshoppers?" That tells you something about their sense of self-worth and their self-esteem.
[time=2076] Remember watching a movie, I can't even remember the name of it years ago, and the Germans come busting into this French house, and the one man jumps up and says, "I'm a Frenchman and you won't take me," and the Nazis grab them and drag them away, and they turn to the other guy, and they say, "What are you?" And he says, "I'm but a mouse, just an itty-bitty little mouse." What are you?
[time=2098] Caleb saw himself as a man equipped by God in the perspective of confidence, and everyone
[time=2106] else said, "I'm just a little grasshopper.
[time=2108] I'm just a little mouse." The anatomy of a visionary.
[time=2114] Thirdly, a visionary is someone who will have a perspective of the future.
[time=2119] Caleb looked ahead, and he said, "God will give us that land." Visionaries look ahead when everybody else looks back.
[time=2127] Everybody else said, "I wish we went back to Egypt." Those were the good old days.
[time=2131] "Oh, I'd really like to go back to Egypt." Do you ever do an honest assessment when you talk about the past, the good old days?
[time=2140] "Oh, I'd love to go back to the good old days." You know, when you were back in the good old days, you know what you wanted?
[time=2147] The good old days that were before them.
[time=2150] Our mind has the ability to color the past a lot prettier than it was.
[time=2156] These people looked back at the past, and because there were giants in the head, they said, "Egypt wasn't so bad." I mean, being a slave wasn't all bad.
[time=2165] I mean, they beat us, but it wasn't all the time.
[time=2168] I mean, they didn't feed us, but occasionally they gave us some food, and suddenly these people wanted to go back to slavery.
[time=2177] So back to Egypt, because they didn't have the anatomy of a visionary who could look
[time=2183] to the future.
[time=2185] Fourthly, in the anatomy of a visionary, in the anatomy of a visionary, there is also one who has the perspective of faith.
[time=2195] Caleb wasn't one intoxicated with his own self-esteem.
[time=2198] He said, "We can do it because the Lord will deliver the land to us." He had the faith to believe that God will do what God said that he will do.
[time=2210] He saw God in his life, when everyone else did not.
[time=2216] And in fact, the other spies in the nation of Israel, they're only referenced that God
[time=2222] was negative.
[time=2223] It was almost at the point of swearing as they uttered, "Would the God who had never left Egypt?" You see, you can use God's name and mean two different things by it.
[time=2238] Two men woke up on the same morning, and they said the exact same words in a different way in a different order.
[time=2245] One man rose, pulled open the blind, looked out and saw the sunshine, and he said, "Good morning, God." Neighbor walked over, pulled up his blind, looked out, and saw the sun, and he said, "Good God morning." It's really a matter of perspective.
[time=2261] There was Caleb who said, "God is with us.
[time=2264] Let's move on." And there were the rest of the people who said, "God has brought us here, and I wish we had never left Egypt." Visionary is one that has great faith in God.
[time=2275] But that's what has happened in Caleb's life before we come to Joshua chapter 14.
[time=2281] Now in Joshua chapter 14, we come to a new adventure.
[time=2287] This man, if you'll recall as we read it, is now 85 years old.
[time=2296] He's 85.
[time=2298] He was 40 years old when he went out and spied out the land.
[time=2301] Then for 40 years he wandered with the nation of Israel, and now for five years he's fought
[time=2307] battle side by side with Joshua.
[time=2310] He's 85.
[time=2312] It's always refreshing when you meet an older man who still not only has the body that functions,
[time=2319] but the spirit that makes that body move.
[time=2323] We have a neighbor who, when he was 85, was up on his roof cleaning out his gutters with one leg dangling over the side just like he was a young boy.
[time=2333] I was a little taken back by that and I went over and I said to my neighbor, "Can I get up there and help you?" And like that he said, "No, I don't think it'd be safe for you to be up here."
[time=2345] Isn't it refreshing when you come to a person that no matter how old they are, the spirit hasn't died?
[time=2352] Now we come to Caleb.
[time=2353] He's 85 years old and the spirit hasn't died.
[time=2358] Let's talk about what he did.
[time=2360] According to Joshua chapter 14, he tells us three things that he did.
[time=2365] The first thing that he reminds us is that in the past he had spied out the land.
[time=2370] He had stuck behind enemy lines, he had gone incognito, he had hidden and he had looked
[time=2378] and he had surveyed and he had brought back the evidence of the bounty of the land.
[time=2386] He was a man who not only spied out the land, but he conquered the land.
[time=2391] If I can steal a page out of Ronald Reagan's book when he said, "In George was there."
[time=2397] When Joshua fought the kingdoms of Sihan and Og, Caleb was there.
[time=2404] When the children of Israel marched across the Jordan River with its water stop, Caleb
[time=2410] was there.
[time=2412] When they marched around the city of Jericho until the walls fell down, Caleb was there.
[time=2419] When the nation of Israel would march on the city of A.I. and suffer their first defeat, Caleb was there.
[time=2426] When they would make a counter-attack and win, Caleb was there.
[time=2431] When the five nations of the Amorites under Adonai Zodek would make a coalition to fight,
[time=2438] Caleb was there.
[time=2439] When Joshua would drive that coalition back and pray that the sun would stand still, Caleb
[time=2446] was there.
[time=2448] He had fought and conquered that land, and now at 85 years old he makes a claim on the
[time=2455] hill country.
[time=2458] Here's a man at 85 years old that could have been on Social Security for 20 years.
[time=2465] Here's a man who could have said, "I have fought my battles.
[time=2468] I'll let the next generation do it.
[time=2472] I'm retired." Here's a man who makes a claim on the land.
[time=2480] It's a land.
[time=2482] He says, "I want another adventure, one with mountains to climb, and one with giants to
[time=2491] slay." How did he do that?
[time=2495] How did he begin a new adventure in 85?
[time=2499] How do you begin a new adventure in life?
[time=2501] As we look back at the past, we thank God for what he's done in this church and in individual eyes, but it's a new year.
[time=2508] It's the mark of a new adventure.
[time=2510] How did a man begin a new adventure?
[time=2511] I'd like to share with you three more qualities out of his life.
[time=2516] First of all, he was a man of convictions.
[time=2521] Look at verse 7, "I was 40 years old when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from
[time=2527] Cady's Barnia to explore the land, and I brought him back a report according to my convictions,
[time=2535] but my brothers who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear."
[time=2541] Convictions make the individual.
[time=2547] Caleb was what he was because in his life he had personalized his values, and he was
[time=2553] a man or woman of convictions.
[time=2556] Until a person adopts their own convictions, they'll never go anywhere in life spiritually
[time=2562] or otherwise.
[time=2563] You cannot live off of your parents' convictions.
[time=2567] You cannot live off your church's convictions.
[time=2570] You cannot borrow your convictions from your friends.
[time=2573] They have to be yours, my values, my convictions.
[time=2580] It was his conviction that he was going to follow the Lord wholeheartedly, whether anybody else did or not.
[time=2586] It was his conviction that God said he would give him the land, then God will give us the land.
[time=2592] He was a man who had an internal drive that was not determined upon external confirmation.
[time=2599] It didn't matter what everybody else was doing.
[time=2601] He was doing what was right.
[time=2605] Here's a time when we have to assess something.
[time=2608] Ten out of twelve people said, "No, we shouldn't go."
[time=2615] Only two said, "We should." This lesson about convictions, the majority, is occasionally, no often, wrong.
[time=2629] Don't ever allow your convictions to be determined by majority rule because the majority will
[time=2637] usually be wrong.
[time=2639] Ten out of twelve of them were wrong.
[time=2645] Loving out of twelve of Jesus' disciples abandoned him at the cross, and they were wrong.
[time=2652] Jesus said, "Narrow is the gate that leads to eternal life, and few find it.
[time=2658] Wide is the path that leads to destruction, and many find it."
[time=2664] The fine preacher, Hayden Robinson, makes this comment about the lack of convictions in our culture today.
[time=2669] He said, "Most politicians try to lead from the middle.
[time=2674] They try to get in the middle and find out what is it the people are doing, what is it that people want, and their only point of conviction is a poll.
[time=2683] Let me take a poll, and then I'll determine what I believe." Caleb was a man who didn't care what the popularity poll said, he had an internal drive.
[time=2694] His convictions were rooted in the person and the word of God, and it made all the difference.
[time=2698] Secondly, he was a man of great convictions coupled with great courage.
[time=2707] He said, "Everybody else's heart was melting within them for fear, but I responded according
[time=2714] to my convictions." It was a man of unparalleled courage.
[time=2721] He was courageous in the face of opposition out there, and he was courageous in the face
[time=2730] of opposition in here.
[time=2734] You see, opposition will come not only from your enemies, but it will come from those who should be your allies.
[time=2741] You see, whenever you take a step of spiritual advance, you're leaving the rest of us behind and most of us are going to say, "You shouldn't do that." Our motivation is, "You shouldn't do that because it points out the fact that I'm not." But we really say, "You shouldn't do that and come up with another reason to camouflage at all." Most of us are committed to spiritual mediocrity, and we're really upset when somebody else
[time=2767] breaks out of the pack because it shows how slow we're growing and how slow we're moving.
[time=2775] Philip broke out of the pack, which put him at odds not only with the giants in the land,
[time=2781] but with the people of Israel.
[time=2782] They didn't like that.
[time=2785] Not only doesn't the world like a visionary, neither does the church.
[time=2790] He was a man who had the courage to face them both.
[time=2794] In Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, he writes, "When Christian reached the top of hill difficulty,
[time=2803] he came upon to running a man whose names were Timorets in mistrust.
[time=2811] Christian said to them, "Sirs, what's the matter?
[time=2815] You run in the wrong way." Timorets answered, "That they were going to the city of Zion, but the further we go, the more danger we meet with, wherefore we turned and we're going back."
[time=2829] And mistrust said, just before us, like a couple of lions in the way, whether sleeping
[time=2837] or waking, we do not know.
[time=2841] And we could not think if we came within reach, but they would pull us into pieces.
[time=2850] But Christian wisely replies, "You can make me afraid.
[time=2856] But whether shall I fly to be safe?
[time=2859] If I go back to my own country, that is prepared for fire and brimstone.
[time=2863] I shall certainly perish there.
[time=2866] But if I can get to the celestial city, I am sure to be safe there.
[time=2870] I must venture to go back is nothing but death.
[time=2878] To go forward is fear of death, but everlasting life beyond it.
[time=2883] I will go forward." Courage.
[time=2890] Courage is required to face the lions, but it's also needed to face our compatriots,
[time=2899] or willing to go back.
[time=2901] It's a new year.
[time=2903] It's time for a new adventure.
[time=2906] Requires courage.
[time=2908] Thirdly, what Caleb had was he had commitment.
[time=2914] Repeatedly in the Bible, this man is described as one whose commitment was unequivocal.
[time=2920] He followed the Lord wholeheartedly.
[time=2926] Caleb said of himself in Joshua 14-8, "I have followed the Lord wholeheartedly."
[time=2932] Joshua said of Caleb, "He has followed the Lord wholeheartedly."
[time=2939] But most significantly in Numbers, chapter 19, verse 24, "The Lord said of Caleb, 'He
[time=2946] has followed me wholeheartedly.'" He was a man of unequivocal conviction, courage, and commitment.
[time=2959] Two of Old McDonald's animals were talking about their involvement and commitment to
[time=2965] the farmer's breakfast.
[time=2967] In a moment of frustration, the pig looked at the chicken and said, "Yeah, you're involved with the breakfast, but I'm committed." That's the difference between the ham and the eggs.
[time=2980] A lot of us who are involved in the Christian life, we aren't necessarily committed.
[time=2988] It is said that when Cortez and his Spanish fleet reached the new world and landed in
[time=2994] Mexico, the first thing that Cortez did was to burn his ships.
[time=3000] They were committed to staying and conquering the land.
[time=3006] There is a song that we need to sing more.
[time=3009] It goes like this, "I have decided to follow Jesus.
[time=3016] I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=3024] No no one join me, still I will follow.
[time=3028] Though no one join me, still I will follow, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=3037] The world behind me, the cross before me, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=3046] Caleb was a man who had no idea as to how to turn back.
[time=3054] You followed the Lord wholeheartedly." Can I bring this now down to some very specific applications for you, for me, for us?
[time=3065] As we look back at 1988, it was a tremendous year.
[time=3069] God has blessed us in some extraordinary ways.
[time=3073] We sit in this auditorium.
[time=3074] It's been the dream of this church for years to have an auditorium just like this one.
[time=3079] In 1988, it became a reality.
[time=3083] This past year, super-60, celebrated ten years of ministry, reaching thousands and thousands of senior adults.
[time=3090] 31 of us went to Jamaica and established a church and missions is on the move.
[time=3096] It's been a great year.
[time=3098] By God's grace, we've been able to purchase more than half of the television equipment we need it.
[time=3105] God has blessed us.
[time=3107] It's been a great year.
[time=3109] Geolistically, people have come to Christ through every facet of the ministry, from Sunday school to the Christian school to evangelism, explosion to the living Christmas tree.
[time=3121] It's been a great year.
[time=3124] But now we need to look ahead.
[time=3126] What would God have us to do in 1989?
[time=3130] You see, when this year is over, 1989 will either be the year that was or it'll be the year that was, and it's our convictions, our courage, and our commitment that will make
[time=3144] the difference.
[time=3146] I'd like to ask you to be committed in four ways.
[time=3150] First of all, at the beginning of this year, would you commit yourself to being a man or woman of the Word and Prayer?
[time=3157] Would you this year commit yourself that I will regularly and consistently read God's
[time=3163] Word?
[time=3164] I refuse to be a spiritual infant forever.
[time=3169] I will feed myself of the treasures of the Word of God.
[time=3173] Would you in that same theme make a commitment that you'll memorize a verse of scripture a month with us?
[time=3180] As the churches, we begin a new year, we'll have that memory verse, a new one each month.
[time=3185] This month, would you memorize Joshua 1-8?
[time=3188] And this book of the law shall not depart out by mouth, but thou shall meditate there in day and night.
[time=3194] Would you memorize that verse with us?
[time=3197] Would you make a commitment that this year, I'll be a believer committed to the Word of
[time=3203] God and to prayer?
[time=3206] Secondly, would you be committed to outreach?
[time=3209] Would you be committed to sharing Jesus Christ with this community?
[time=3214] Inside your bulletin today, there was a little card that was called a 10 most wanted lift.
[time=3218] That was not supplied by the FBI, they're not looking for your recommendations.
[time=3224] It's a prayer list for you to write down people that don't know Christ and to begin praying for them.
[time=3230] Would you invite them to church?
[time=3232] How about for the open house on January the 29th?
[time=3236] Would you make a commitment to outreach this year?
[time=3239] I will reach out in the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=3242] I will pray for friends, I'll invite them to church on that friend day.
[time=3247] Thirdly, would you make a commitment to ministry?
[time=3252] If you're already serving in a ministry, we're not asking you to take another job.
[time=3257] But if you've been a spectator, would you come off the bench, put on the helmet and run
[time=3264] for Jesus Christ?
[time=3265] Would you find a place to serve Him and be committed to that for a year of ministry?
[time=3271] Fourthly, would you be committed to stewardship?
[time=3275] Because we have faced new adventures, there's also the responsibility financially to give
[time=3282] as God has prospered us.
[time=3284] It's with great joy, we report that even though this past year, our budget had gone up significantly.
[time=3291] By the time you're ended, we were over our budget.
[time=3294] We thank God for that and thank you for your generosity.
[time=3298] But it's like a basketball game.
[time=3300] When you win a game by 20 points and you move on to the next contest, the scoreboard reads
[time=3306] zero to zero, you don't get to carry those 20 points.
[time=3311] It's a brand new year and we can't say, well, in 1988, look what we did.
[time=3316] This is a new adventure in a new year and in 1989, we must boldly march on.
[time=3321] It's going to take the commitment of each of our lives in every way, including financial stewardship.
[time=3328] As you read the bulletin at home this week, we'll discover that for the next year, our budget will need to go up again, it will need to be committed again to growth.
[time=3337] In this next year, I have great expectation that our church will grow and the need for
[time=3343] facilities will grow for our Sunday school, for our Christian school, for various ministries.
[time=3349] There'll be challenges ahead of us and we must not look back and say, oh, but look what
[time=3355] we did last year.
[time=3357] Caleb would have never said, oh, look what I did when I was 40.
[time=3361] Look what I did when I was 80, I'm 85, I quit.
[time=3366] He looked for a new adventure and in our lives, we still have mountains to climb.
[time=3372] We still have giants to face and we still have new adventures to embark upon.
[time=3381] This is a new year.
[time=3382] This is a new opportunity.
[time=3384] The Fort Wayne is still looking to see what God can do in and with and through the church
[time=3392] that is holy, committed to Him.
[time=3409] If today you're ready to make your new beginning, a new adventure with Christ.
[time=3414] I want to encourage you to begin now by asking Him into your heart as your Savior and pledging
[time=3421] to follow Him as Lord.
[time=3423] I'd like to lead you in this simple prayer.
[time=3426] Lord Jesus, I believe that You are the Son of God and that You died for my sins.
[time=3434] I ask You to come into my heart and forgive me and give my life new direction.
[time=3441] [AMEN] We would so much like to hear from you today.
[time=3446] Please write us and let us know the nature of the decision you've made today.
[time=3451] And we'll send you a copy of a helpful booklet entitled, Your Decision.
[time=3455] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=3458] To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled Closer Walk, please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468-15.
[time=3473] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1376 or use
[time=3479] the sermon title, New Adventures.
[time=3481] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3487] This has been a great year for all of us here at Blackhawk and particularly for the Bible Hour.
[time=3493] We hope that you have some great memories of 1988 and better yet, we hope that you have a great expectation about a new year.
[time=3501] As we come to a close of one year and anticipate a next, we want to take a moment and thank
[time=3507] those very important people who make the Bible Hour possible.
[time=3511] Behind the scenes, behind the set, in the studios and behind the camera, are a great crew of men and women who work as volunteers to make this ministry possible.
[time=3520] And it's our privilege to introduce them to you in a brief moment now, so that we can thank them together.
[time=3550] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=3610] As we express our gratitude to our technical team, we want you to know how thankful we
[time=3622] are for you.
[time=3623] There's nobody more important than new friends who have prayed for this ministry, who've watched, who've sent a note of encouragement, or who supported the Bible Hour financially.
[time=3633] From all of us to each of you, we wish you a very great, prosperous, and spiritually dynamic, brand new year.
