[time=90] Little Wesley Parker was only 11 years old. He was diabetic. His body daily required an injection of insulin. His parents took him to a special service where a healer was supposed to be, and the preacher put hands on Wesley and announced that he had been healed.
[time=115] Joyfully, the next morning, Wesley's father, Larry Parker, wrote these words in his diary, "Praise God, Wesley has been healed."
[time=126] But the insulin tests proved different. Wesley was not healed. His body began to show the signs of diabetic withdrawal, but the parents thought this is just a trick of Satan.
[time=139] We've got to claim our miracle and believe, and they refuse to give Wesley, his insulin. And three days later, Wesley died.
[time=152] Later, Larry and Alice Parker, Wesley's parents, told their story in a book, "We Let Our Son Die."
[time=161] What does the Bible say about faith healing? Is it healing or is it hoax?
[time=180] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled, "What the Bible Says About Healing."
[time=194] Does God heal today? Our faith healers for real. How much faith does a miracle take? Am I the one being taken?
[time=202] Today in the Bible Hour, we will investigate what the Bible says about healing.
[time=207] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of James. We will be looking at James chapter 5 verses 14 through 18.
[time=216] Our sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song with a song entitled, "Amen, Amen."
[time=223] Other special music includes a duet from Marilyn Wong and Ed Richard, and a solo from Kerry Johnson.
[time=231] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=239] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you. Now, here's Rick.
[time=245] Welcome this morning to our worship service. We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=254] This morning, as we worship, we have the privilege of reflecting on some of the great songs that were part of our Christmas concert that are timeless.
[time=262] The great crescendo, that, "Amen," the choir will sing.
[time=266] And then in a few moments, we'll have the privilege of hearing from Ed and Marilyn as they sang one of my favorite songs, "Once and For All."
[time=274] But regardless of the song, regardless of the message, I hope in your heart you've come today to worship the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=284] [MUSIC - 441 seconds]
[time=750] [APPLAUSE]
[time=758] Amen. What a privilege to pronounce that he is indeed our Savior and our Lord. Privilege of being away last week, and we had a nice relaxing time.
[time=770] Enjoyed the ministry of John MacArthur at my brother's church in California, but it's nothing like, as Rick would say, coming back to Blackhawk.
[time=778] And being here with my choir and orchestra and all of you, it's wonderful.
[time=782] Delighted to be back and delighted to have this auditorium where we can praise the name of the Lord.
[time=789] Blessed be the name of the Lord, that's the theme of our next hymn, 103, please, hymn number 103.
[time=796] Some of you are still enjoying your neighbor singing and the choir singing, but you haven't participated.
[time=802] Music is an active participation. You must get involved to enjoy the blessings.
[time=808] Never mind whether you're on pitch or not, your neighbor will overlook that.
[time=812] Just get involved and enjoy the music and the text as we sing. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=818] [MUSIC - 112 seconds]
[time=951] I think even the cameramen were singing on that one. We used just about everything, including the tape recorders upstairs.
[time=961] We appreciated the ministry of Ed Richard and Marilyn Wong as they sang for us night after night, and the ministry of the song called "Once and For All the Father Gave the Savior."
[time=973] [MUSIC - 278 seconds]
[time=1273] It's our privilege to welcome you to the Bible Hour at the beginning of this new year.
[time=1279] We hope it's a new adventure for you. Pete, I'm glad to have you back. I hope you had a great rest and fun time in California.
[time=1286] Thank you, Rick. I did have a very restful time. There were no great adventures, just a good visit with my brother and his wife and some other friends that we have in California.
[time=1296] Did you make it to the rose parade? Yes, sir. I did.
[time=1298] Lived up to all your expectations. Oh, it's beautiful. It's just completely different when you see it live. The floats with the live flowers and the fragrance even that is emitted from the floats is just beautiful. They are quite a sight.
[time=1313] Well, let me use that as a lead to you friends that the rose parade is much better in person and so is the Bible Hour.
[time=1320] And if you live in the Fort Wayne area, we would like to invite you to come and join us in person, particularly for an open house we're having on Sunday morning January the 29th.
[time=1331] We have two morning worship services. One is at 9.15. The other is at 10.50. We'd love to have you come to either one of those services.
[time=1340] It's a way of meeting face to face, shaking hands, getting to know each other. Opportunity for you to have a part in our open house as we open this new sanctuary up for our community to come and to observe and to worship with us.
[time=1353] So we hope that you'll set that day aside January the 29th, either at 9.15 or 10.50 for an open house here at Blackhawk.
[time=1362] Well, we are glad that you're back. Did you have a chance to worship in any exciting churches out there? Yes, my brother attends the Grace Community Church in Panorama City and Dr. John MacArthur is the pastor and was delighted to see him again and greet him and worship in their service.
[time=1379] It was a wonderful service. It's kind of nice to realize that you can go across the country and still down the road a few miles from my brother's home. You can worship the same Lord.
[time=1389] Well, you had a real privilege there because John MacArthur is one of the finest Bible teachers today and often I lean on his commentaries in my own Bible study.
[time=1398] Today we are going to be studying the issue of what does the Bible say about faith healing? Is it actually healing or is it a hoax?
[time=1407] Much of my research I've drawn off a helpful booklet by David Hawking and we'd like to make that booklet available to you by simply writing to us and asking for the booklet on healing.
[time=1418] David has included some great insights in his book "Out of Scripture" so that you'll be able to study the Bible as you study this booklet and see not what one person's experiences or what one person declares, but what is it that God has said about this issue of faith healing?
[time=1437] I hope that you're a student of the Bible, but I hope you'll also draw on some helpful tools to guide you in your Bible study.
[time=1444] If you'd like a copy of this booklet, we'd be glad to send you one free.
[time=1449] David Hawking has another fine Bible teacher and we encourage you to write for this booklet.
[time=1454] You can write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1463] Once again, write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1472] Thank you, Pete. And again, let me add my encouragement to you to write for the booklet.
[time=1477] We'll send it to you as a gift from us to you and then for you friends in the greater Fort Wayne area.
[time=1483] Again, please receive our invitation to come Sunday morning, January the 29th at either 915 or 1050 for one of our morning worship services as we host an open house here at Blackhawk at the Bible hour.
[time=1498] Thanks for being a part of this ministry today.
[time=1528] [MUSIC - 265 seconds]
[time=1808] Our Father, we meet today in the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1814] who was broken and spilled out for each of us.
[time=1819] We come to save from the depth of our heart that we are grateful,
[time=1825] that we love you.
[time=1827] We've come with our songs and our words to elevate and to magnify your name and to worship you.
[time=1834] May you be glorified today, Lord Jesus.
[time=1837] May your name be exalted above every name.
[time=1841] And as we meet, we ask you to meet with us to accept the gifts of our worship and to meet with us to teach us the very word of God.
[time=1851] We ask you to come across today by a spirit of healing and of restoration.
[time=1859] We pray that your grace will be sufficient today for those in the deepest of valleys.
[time=1865] We pray this morning for Joe Young, and the loss of his wife Nancy in a car accident, for Nancy's parents Jim and Blanche
[time=1875] Hindle, for her brothers Jim and Larry, Ron and Bill.
[time=1883] For two sons and a little girl, we pray that your hand would be upon Shelly and restore her body physically.
[time=1891] We pray that you would give them a peace that denies understanding
[time=1897] that transcends the valley, that you would keep them today.
[time=1902] We pray for Ron Rang and his family and the death of his father.
[time=1907] We pray for encouragement for those who are in the hospital, for those who are facing surgery in the days ahead like Doc Mutter.
[time=1915] We pray for Darrell Good that he might recover and go home soon.
[time=1920] We pray today with gratitude for those you have strengthened for good news for the Galloway sister and for Julie Berkholder.
[time=1928] We rejoice in your goodness.
[time=1930] We pray this morning that your spirit would speak to each of our hearts.
[time=1934] Give us confidence in your word, even in the valleys.
[time=1938] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1943] I would like to invite you now to stand and Dale Johnson will lead us, as we say from memory, Joshua 1-8.
[time=1951] If you don't know it from memory, please feel free to open your bulletin and read it along, but do make it your habit this new year to memorize God's word with us.
[time=1961] Dale, would you lead us?
[time=1964] Stand please.
[time=1968] Joshua 1-8. Do not let this book of the Lord be part from my mouth.
[time=1976] Meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.
[time=1985] Joshua 1-8. Thank you for meeting me.
[time=1991] Memorizing God's word is a habit that we teach our children early in life.
[time=1997] They have the gifts of recall that are fading in many of our memories.
[time=2002] But even in the middle years and the senior years of life, memorizing God's word will become a direction and a strength that can never be taken away from you.
[time=2012] The Apostle Paul wrote from a Roman prison that he was in chains, but the word of God was not bound.
[time=2019] I hope that you have the power of God's word unshackled in your life.
[time=2025] If you have a Bible with you today, I invite you to open as we will make James chapter 5,
[time=2031] the focal point of our study as we ask some important questions today about divine healing.
[time=2041] A little boy by the name of Wesley Parker was 11 years old and diabetic.
[time=2047] His parents were wonderful parents and godly Christians.
[time=2052] They had heard of a healing service that was going to take place in nearby Barstow, California.
[time=2059] And with all the faith their hearts could muster, they took little Wesley to that healing service.
[time=2066] Their little Wesley was declared healed of diabetes.
[time=2072] His parents took him home and Larry wrote in the journal, "Praise God, our son Wesley has been healed of diabetes."
[time=2082] But the test the next morning revealed that insulin was still needed to control Wesley's diabetic condition.
[time=2091] The parents said, "This must be a trick of Satan, and we just must believe more and claim the miracle."
[time=2099] The next day, little Wesley's body began to show the signs of diabetic shock and then of coma.
[time=2108] And on the third day, Wesley Parker died.
[time=2113] One year later, his parents wrote of this tragedy in a book titled, "We Let Our Son Die."
[time=2122] The question of divine healing, is it healing or is it hoax?
[time=2129] But that's not such a far away story as California in early 1970s.
[time=2135] Even as I would tell this story earlier this morning, one of our technical crew came and said,
[time=2141] "I worked with a bright, Christian young man." He was also diabetic.
[time=2148] He also went to a faith healing service.
[time=2151] He also was declared healed, and he also died.
[time=2156] That was Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=2159] Is it healing or is it hoax?
[time=2164] James chapter 5 verse 14 reads in this way, "Is any among you sick?
[time=2173] He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
[time=2180] And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.
[time=2184] The Lord will raise him up.
[time=2187] If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.
[time=2191] Therefore, confess your sins one to another so that you may be healed.
[time=2199] The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
[time=2205] This passage raises for me a whole series of questions, questions that perhaps are rattling in your mind.
[time=2213] I'd like to use five questions today to give direction to our study, and I hope five answers
[time=2219] that will give insight into the issue of divine healing.
[time=2223] The first question that comes to my mind springs from verse 14.
[time=2227] Is any of you sick this question?
[time=2230] Is it God's will that everybody be healthy?
[time=2234] It says, "Is anybody sick?
[time=2236] Is it perhaps God's will that each of us be healthy and is some would add in each of us to be wealthy?"
[time=2243] Well, let me add that if I get to vote, I'll vote on health and wealth anytime I get a choice.
[time=2249] But I don't think the point of this passage is at all teaching that it's God's will that every single person,
[time=2255] always, every day of their life, be healthy.
[time=2259] Now, how do I come to that?
[time=2261] Well, as you study the scripture, you begin to discover insight.
[time=2266] The book of Job tells us of a righteous man who was accused by Satan of only being righteous
[time=2273] because God blessed him so richly.
[time=2276] And Satan said to God, "God, the only reason Job follows you is because you bless him.
[time=2281] You take away those blessings and he'll curse you and die." And God chose to allow Satan to afflict Job in many ways, including touching his physical health.
[time=2295] And that was all within the will of God.
[time=2298] Paul, in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, was physically sick.
[time=2305] And he prayed three times asking God to heal him and God's answer three times was no.
[time=2312] It is my will for you to be sick so that my grace might be shown in your weakness.
[time=2320] Christ suffered.
[time=2322] In Hebrews 5a, it tells us he learned obedience through the things that he suffered.
[time=2330] In fact, both Peter and James and their epistles tell us to expect trials and tribulations and suffering in our life.
[time=2340] James tells us in chapter 1 that God uses suffering in our life to produce growth.
[time=2348] The songwriter put it this way, "If I never had a trial, I would never know what faith in God could do."
[time=2356] James, by inspiration of God, says, "Count it all joy, my beloved brother,
[time=2362] when you face diverse trials knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience
[time=2368] and let patience have her complete work that you might be entire lacking nothing."
[time=2375] 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verses 3 and 4 tells us that God allows us to be afflicted
[time=2381] so that when he has comforted us, we are better prepared to comfort others.
[time=2388] I think it's safe to conclude it is not always God's will that everyone be healthy.
[time=2395] The second question that comes to mind here is more to the point.
[time=2399] Does God work through faith healers today?
[time=2405] It says, "If any of you are sick, that you should call upon the elders and they should come and they should pray."
[time=2413] From this text, let me make two points.
[time=2416] First of all, if you are sick, you are here invited and instructed to call upon the elders.
[time=2421] The word elder can mean one of two things.
[time=2424] It can mean formally those people who are in leadership in your church, such as myself or another pastor
[time=2431] or someone who is an elder, a leader that you have elected out of this body.
[time=2435] It may mean that.
[time=2437] It may also mean somebody who is simply mature in their faith in Christ.
[time=2442] It might mean those older ones in the faith, hence the term elder, those who are mature in Christ.
[time=2448] Either way, the application is the same that you call upon spiritually minded people to come
[time=2454] and they are to pray in your behalf.
[time=2458] Now, what I want you to note as much as anything else is here.
[time=2462] It doesn't say, "Call upon a healer." It doesn't say, "Go to a tent meeting." It doesn't say, "Seek out somebody with a spiritual gift of healing." It doesn't here say, "Go and ask them to heal you." It simply says, "Go and ask and pray." We need to admit that there were healers in the Bible.
[time=2484] In the Old Testament, Elijah had a gift of healing.
[time=2487] In the New Testament, Jesus did miracle after miracle.
[time=2491] In the book of Acts, we find Peter and John healing.
[time=2495] We find Paul and Barnabas healing.
[time=2497] We find Philip healing.
[time=2499] We find Ananias healing.
[time=2501] Let's not deny that God at points in time has used faith healers.
[time=2508] But is he doing it today?
[time=2510] Let's take a moment and look at the type of healing that took place in the Bible.
[time=2516] First of all, the methods of healing in the Bible were various.
[time=2521] For example, in Matthew 8, Jesus performs a miracle of healing.
[time=2528] Chapter 8 verse 1, "When he came down from the mountainside, large crowds of people followed him.
[time=2535] A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man.
[time=2545] "I am willing," he said, "be clean." Immediately, he was cured of his leprosy.
[time=2550] Jesus simply touched the man and that man was healed.
[time=2557] In other accounts, Jesus' methodology was quite different.
[time=2561] He would simply speak the word and somebody would be healed.
[time=2567] For example, Jesus simply spoke the word in Chapter 8 of Matthew and verse 26
[time=2574] and the sea was calm, simply when his voice commanded it to be so.
[time=2581] In Mark Chapter 8 verse 22, Jesus did something unusual.
[time=2585] And I'll tell you it, you may be of the mind, it's crude.
[time=2588] But the Bible says that Jesus spit on his hands and he touched a man's eyes
[time=2595] and he was healed.
[time=2596] In Matthew, it tells us that Jesus would use various means.
[time=2602] And Mark gives other illustrations.
[time=2604] In John one time, Jesus took spit, formed it into clay, put it on the man's eyes,
[time=2610] told him to go wash in a pool and the man was made to see again.
[time=2615] The methodology was various.
[time=2617] In the book of Acts, Peter and John were encountering an individual who was simply pleading for money.
[time=2623] And they said, "Silver and gold, have we none but such as we have.
[time=2626] Give unto thee in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, rise up and walk." And rose up and walked, he was healed instantly.
[time=2632] Nobody touched him, they just spoke the word.
[time=2637] In Acts later on, they stole Paul's handkerchief, took it from Paul to somebody who was sick
[time=2644] and when they touched the handkerchief, they were healed.
[time=2647] The methodology was varied, but the results were always the same.
[time=2652] And please note this, in every biblical account of a healing, the healing was instant and undeniable, instant and undeniable.
[time=2664] When we read a moment ago from Matthew chapter 8 of the leprosy, that man was healed immediately.
[time=2670] When Jesus spoke, the seek calmed immediately.
[time=2673] When the Lord said, "Lazarus, come forth," they came forth out of the dead immediately.
[time=2678] When Peter and John said, "Rise up that man at the gate of the temple, rose up and walked," every New Testament miracle was immediate.
[time=2687] If you have another mindset, you're probably racing to Mark chapter 8 and saying, "Oh no, there was one miracle that was not immediate." When Jesus spit on his hands and he touched that blind man's eyes in Mark chapter 8,
[time=2700] Jesus said to the man, "Do you see?" and the man said, "Oh, I see, but I see trees walking around his people." And Jesus touched him again and then the man saw normally.
[time=2712] And there are those that use that as a proof text.
[time=2715] It teaches that miracles may simply take time.
[time=2718] You may go to a healer and they may heal you, but it may take time for your miracle to come into play.
[time=2726] Let me make three points about that.
[time=2728] First of all, this is still in Mark chapter 8 and immediate healing because the man never left Jesus' sight.
[time=2734] The man never walked away. There was no time involved other than the time for Jesus to ask one simple question and to touch him again.
[time=2743] We're not talking about a miracle that came a month later, a week later, or you had to go home and pray for it to get finished.
[time=2750] Secondly, Jesus deliberately gave this man a two-phase healing, and we can tell that it's deliberate because Jesus did something with this man and he did no other healing service, and that is he touched the man and then he asked the man, "Can you see?" Never before did Jesus do that.
[time=2771] When Lazarus came forth, he didn't say, "Lazarus, are you alive?" He never did that. Why did Jesus do that?
[time=2779] I believe Jesus did that because he was actually not doing one miracle but two.
[time=2785] Jesus touched the man's eyes and now the man had a physical miracle.
[time=2791] Whatever was biologically, physiologically wrong with his eyes had been restored.
[time=2798] But what if this man had never seen?
[time=2801] He wouldn't know what a person looked like. He wouldn't know what a tree would look like.
[time=2805] He wouldn't know what a dog would look like.
[time=2807] And the second miracle that Jesus performed was not a miracle physiologically but cognitively. Jesus gave him the second miracle that his mind now had a history that never had before of understanding.
[time=2821] There was no time delay here. There were two separate miracles.
[time=2826] There are two other miracles that some would say Jesus used time.
[time=2832] John chapter 7, when Jesus put the clay on the man's eyes and told him to go wash in the pool.
[time=2840] I don't believe there was any delay there. Jesus was simply giving to this man a responsibility and as soon as he completed that responsibility he was healed.
[time=2850] When Jesus healed ten lepers the Bible says as they went they were healed.
[time=2855] I don't believe we have the prerogative of reading days, weeks, months or years because it tells us they were healed and immediately one of the ten came back.
[time=2864] There was no time delay.
[time=2868] Before I can give you a conclusion on does God work through faith healers today?
[time=2873] I want to raise a third question out of James and that is what is the role of faith?
[time=2879] Because all the healing that is being done today is being done in the name of faith.
[time=2886] Three points about faith. First of all, faith is vitally important.
[time=2892] On a general platform Hebrews 11, 6 tells us without faith it is impossible to please God.
[time=2899] Faith is important. James chapter 1 verse 6 tells us when you pray you must have faith.
[time=2905] Don't be double-minded, doubting like a wave driven and tossed by the sea.
[time=2910] Faith is important.
[time=2913] Also, faith is cited as the occasion for many of the healings of the Lord Jesus.
[time=2921] Often Jesus said your faith has made you well.
[time=2924] It will be done unto you according as you have believed.
[time=2928] And we dare not for a moment minimize the role of faith.
[time=2932] Faith is important. However, faith is not always the issue.
[time=2938] For example, in 2 Kings chapter 5, God chooses through Elijah the heal an unbeliever.
[time=2947] Naom was an unbeliever and when it came time for his miracle he doubted.
[time=2953] Elijah said, "Now you go down and you dip yourself seven times in the Jordan River." And Naom said, "Go dip myself seven times in the Jordan River.
[time=2960] Do you think your water is better than our water?
[time=2962] I've got to use water in my home country." This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[time=2966] He didn't have much faith.
[time=2968] Somebody said, "Hey, if the prophet told you to do some great thing you'd do it wouldn't you?" He said, "Well, yes." He said, "Well, then go do this simple thing." So Naom goes down there, so I'll dip myself seven times and he was healed.
[time=2979] He was the most surprised man.
[time=2981] It wasn't his faith.
[time=2983] He wasn't a believer and he doubted the miracle.
[time=2987] Jesus did three miracles of resurrection.
[time=2992] Nobody who's dead was expressing great faith.
[time=2998] And none of the family members were expecting a miracle at Lazarus' grave side.
[time=3004] Jesus walked up to a funeral procession and touched a boy and he became alive.
[time=3011] Nobody believed that was going to happen.
[time=3014] Faith is not always the issue.
[time=3019] But the most important thing I can say thirdly about faith is found in Matthew chapter 17.
[time=3026] And I do want you to turn there in your Bible.
[time=3029] Matthew chapter 17.
[time=3040] Verse 14, "Then they came to the crowd.
[time=3044] A man approached Jesus and knelt before him.
[time=3048] "Lord, have mercy on my son," he said.
[time=3050] He's an epileptic and he's suffering greatly.
[time=3053] He often falls into fire or into water.
[time=3056] "I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him." "Oh, unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied.
[time=3067] "How long shall I stay with you?
[time=3072] Bring the boy to me." Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of the boy and he was healed from that moment.
[time=3079] Now follow this narrative.
[time=3082] Then the disciples came to Jesus and private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
[time=3089] And he replied, "Because you disciples, because you would be healers, have so little faith."
[time=3098] The point that I want you to see about faith more than anything else when it comes to healing is faith is required not only of those who would be healed, but of those who would be the healers.
[time=3109] Let me speak bold.
[time=3111] When was the last time you heard of a faith healer saying, "I'm sorry, you can't be healed because I don't have the faith?"
[time=3118] You'll never hear it.
[time=3120] They will always put the faith responsibility on you who want to be healed.
[time=3125] They'll never say, "I can't do it. I don't have the faith."
[time=3133] More humorously, one faith healer sent out a letter saying, "If you send me $50, God will multiply it back to you ten times if you have the faith to believe it."
[time=3146] A man got the letter and wrote it back to the faith healer and said, "I believe it, but how about you send me the $50 and let God multiply it back to you?"
[time=3156] I wonder how many things we would actually teach as responsibilities if we were the one to carry the responsibility.
[time=3165] I'm going to draw a conclusion about faith healers and faith in particular.
[time=3171] No, I do not believe God works through faith healers today.
[time=3177] Let me give you three reasons.
[time=3180] One, because nobody is doing instant, undeniable miracles today.
[time=3191] Before you call me or you write in by way of television, let me give you an instant and undeniable list of miracles.
[time=3199] If you'll do one of these, I'll recant everything I've said.
[time=3202] One, if you will raise a person who's been dead for three days, I'll believe.
[time=3208] Two, if you'll go out on Lake Erie in the middle of the storm and say, "Peace be still and the waters will be still, I'll believe."
[time=3216] Three, if you will get a carryout lunch from Long John Silvers and put it in the bag of my choosing
[time=3223] and pull out enough to feed 5,000 people, I'll believe.
[time=3228] If you can't do any of those miracles, don't call me and tell me you're a faith healer.
[time=3234] Because those are the instant, undeniable miracles of the Bible.
[time=3239] I am tired of accounts of people saying, "I went to a faith healer and I've been healed, and I see all the affirmities."
[time=3249] I was visiting a television station that claimed that their owner had a faith healing ministry.
[time=3255] They had a chapel.
[time=3257] I said, "What do they use the chapel for?" And they said, "Well, that's for Dr. So-and-so's healing ministry.
[time=3262] And in the providence of God, the door opened and the maintenance man limped out."
[time=3270] Now, I may be sounding harsh today, but let me tell you this with the bottom of my heart.
[time=3277] If I believed that God worked through faith healers today, I would rush Little Shelly Hindu there right now.
[time=3285] If I believed God worked through faith healers today, I would take Marv Degas in the wheelchair there at this very moment.
[time=3293] I wish that God was working in signs and wonders and miracles today because I would drop my Bible teaching ministry.
[time=3301] I would get a van with a hydraulic lift and I'd be taking people to faith healing ministries all day every day.
[time=3308] It's not that I don't want to, but that I can't.
[time=3313] A second reason why I don't believe it is not only because people aren't doing instant, undeniable miracles today,
[time=3320] is they're using faith as a scapegoat.
[time=3324] Never are they saying we don't have enough faith to heal you.
[time=3327] You've got too tough of a case, buddy.
[time=3330] Faith is always being used as a scapegoat.
[time=3333] And finally, we see a pattern in the New Testament of miracles slowly ending.
[time=3339] Early in Paul's ministry, he healed people right and left.
[time=3342] He touched them, they were better. He spoke the word, they were healed.
[time=3345] He raised the dead, healed the lay, made the blind to see.
[time=3348] He did it all, and then suddenly Paul's sick and he can't heal himself.
[time=3352] Suddenly, Tim of these sick and Paul said, "Take a little wine for your stomach's sake." And Patroditus is sick and Paul can't do a thing about it.
[time=3360] Trophemus is near death and Paul can only pray.
[time=3364] You see in the New Testament, a pattern that God used in miracles to draw people's attention.
[time=3370] And then once they heard the gospel and the Bible was established, the miracles faded away.
[time=3376] Another question that comes out of the text back in James is the question,
[time=3382] "Is sickness always a result of sin?" And in the conservation of time, let me say this very quickly.
[time=3388] It can be, but it usually is not.
[time=3391] Sure, God often uses sickness to discipline us to get our attention, but it's not always that a reason.
[time=3399] The final question that comes, "Well, does confessing sin cure sickness?"
[time=3405] It can.
[time=3406] If your sickness was caused by sin, God may alleviate that.
[time=3411] Psalm 32, David said, "I was sick.
[time=3414] In my heart and in my body because of my sin and when I confessed it, I was better."
[time=3421] Now, let me try to draw this to a very quick summary.
[time=3425] What should you do if you're sick?
[time=3428] First thing you should do if you are sick is you should pray.
[time=3432] Because even though God does not work through faith healers today, I believe God answers prayer and he still occasionally works in a miraculous way.
[time=3441] Not through a person who has a gift, but through prayer that he answers in behalf of the body of Christ.
[time=3448] We have been praying for Julie Burkholder.
[time=3452] And on Wednesday she came up to me and she said, "I've got good news.
[time=3457] I am 95% in remission of cancer." I believe chemotherapy works.
[time=3464] I believe medicine works and I believe prayer works.
[time=3467] We had a little boy in our church who had post chicken pox encephalitis.
[time=3472] We prayed for him and he recovered.
[time=3476] The second thing I'd do after I prayed is I'd call the doctor.
[time=3480] And I'd take whatever medicine he applied.
[time=3483] To me that makes good biblical sense and that makes good common sense.
[time=3488] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir.
[time=3510] The duet from Marilyn Wong and Ed Richard and soloist Kerry Johnson.
[time=3514] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3517] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior.
[time=3522] Just before we close I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3526] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that you sent your son Jesus Christ to come as a babe and then to die on a cross for my sins.
[time=3536] I ask you today to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse my heart.
[time=3542] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3546] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us of your decision.
[time=3550] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
