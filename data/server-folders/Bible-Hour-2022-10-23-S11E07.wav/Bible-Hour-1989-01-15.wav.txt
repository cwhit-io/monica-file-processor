[time=61] Depression can get a grip on any of us.
[time=64] Even the strongest and the most spiritual can be seized by its grip.
[time=71] Frank Min more tells an interesting story to illustrate how depression goes through a cycle.
[time=77] A man driving down a country road encounters a nail and punctures his tire.
[time=82] The tire immediately goes flat.
[time=84] He rummages through his trunk to find no jack.
[time=88] Looking up, he sees a farmhouse all about a quarter mile down the way.
[time=93] As he walks to the farmhouse, he begins to feel bad.
[time=96] He feels bad that he didn't plan ahead and have a jack.
[time=100] He feels bad that he has to depend on somebody else.
[time=103] And his depression works on him the whole way to he knocks on the farmer's door.
[time=108] When the farmer opens the door, he says, "Ock, keep your dumb jack anyway." Now he's convinced that the whole world's against him and his depression grows deeper.
[time=118] [MUSIC]
[time=131] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=136] Thank you for joining us.
[time=137] Rick's message today is entitled, "What the Bible Says About Depression." We all get depressed, for some of us it is a brief encounter with the blogs, but for others it is an extended voyage into the pits, as David called it in the Psalms.
[time=153] Today's message is in no way intended to replace the counseling and perhaps medication that some of us may need.
[time=160] But it is an effort to achieve three goals, understanding what depression is, identifying what causes depression, and learning what spiritual principles can help overcome depression.
[time=174] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Psalms.
[time=178] Rick's text is taken from chapter 88 verses 1 through 6.
[time=183] The sanctuary choir will be administering to us in song.
[time=187] Other special music includes a solo from Peter Colby and a duet from Kevin Rowe and Denise Mitchell.
[time=196] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=204] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=209] Now here's Rick.
[time=210] Join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=213] Our purpose for assembling today is to honor the Lord.
[time=217] Our choir is going to sing a medley of songs that focus on that of the title, "Honor the Lord with Your Song of Praise."
[time=226] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=448] We continue our song of praise as we sing together 267.
[time=454] Come, thou almighty king, help us thy name to sing.
[time=458] Him number 267, we'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=464] Come, thou almighty, help us thy name to sing.
[time=512] Him is the one who calls us by His own name.
[time=522] Come, thou almighty, help us thy name to sing.
[time=573] One of the ways to honor the Lord is to heed His word.
[time=577] David said, "Thy word have I hid in my heart so that I might not sin against thee."
[time=584] We've made it our habit as a church to memorize Scripture.
[time=588] And inside the bulletin on the first page, inside your bulletin, is January's memory verse, Joshua 1-8.
[time=596] We're encouraging you to memorize that, to hide it in your heart.
[time=600] You might have a spiritual reservoir of strength on which to draw.
[time=605] We're going to stand and read that verse or say it from memory, whichever you're able to do.
[time=611] And you may be like me.
[time=613] I've memorized this verse in the King James.
[time=615] Now I'm an old horse learning new tricks in the NIV.
[time=618] And I'll meet the challenges best I can, if you will.
[time=622] Would you stand right now?
[time=624] We'll say the reference.
[time=625] Quote the Scripture and end with the reference.
[time=627] Joshua 1-8.
[time=629] Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth.
[time=634] Meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.
[time=642] Joshua 1-8.
[time=644] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=664] [MUSIC]
[time=675] I have no song to sing, but that of Christ my King.
[time=687] You hear my praise I'll bring forever and ever.
[time=698] His love beyond a grave is death that runs on me.
[time=709] Oh, and each early I'll sing it all.
[time=723] I should I sing of lesser things and things that pass away
[time=729] when I'm a friend like Jesus now to sing about each day.
[time=738] He is the theme of angel song that fills the heavens above.
[time=745] Should I not join that for a sweet and praise the Lord I love?
[time=760] I have no song to sing, but that of Christ my King.
[time=773] You hear my praise I'll bring forever and ever.
[time=784] His love beyond a grave is death that runs on me.
[time=795] Oh, and each early I'll sing it all.
[time=807] I find no more delight in other's songs.
[time=818] My melody of love to Christ belongs beyond.
[time=834] I have no song to sing, but that of Christ my King.
[time=847] You hear my praise I'll bring.
[time=859] You hear my praise I'll ever sing forever and ever more.
[time=883] It's a delight to have you joining us today for the Bible hour.
[time=891] I always enjoy the ministry of music and the director of all of those events is Peter Coby.
[time=897] We enjoyed hearing you sing today. That's a rare treat.
[time=901] Well, thanks Rick. We have so many good singers and probably it's just as rewarding for me to see these people sing on Sunday mornings.
[time=908] But occasionally I have a song in my heart too that I like to sing and to tell the message of Christ through a song.
[time=916] You were telling me a moment ago that that's an older song that's been re-orchestrated and I loved it.
[time=922] Well, I really am amazed that the way some orchestrators can take a song and just change it a little bit and bring it so to speak up to date.
[time=931] That song was probably written about 1958. In fact, I remember singing in a little church in Michigan when I was in the 11th grade.
[time=939] And then Don Marsh, a fine arranger, took that song from John Peterson and rearranged a little bit and brought the orchestra up to date.
[time=948] And it still has the same message. It's called my song and it just talks about we have no song to sing but that of Christ our King.
[time=956] Well, thanks for singing that and for the tribute to the Lord. We're delighted that you're joining us today and as we study today, we're looking at the topic of depression.
[time=966] Many people feel the effects of depression but aren't sure where did they come from?
[time=971] How did I get in this mood and most importantly, how can I get out of it?
[time=976] Along with today's study, we want to encourage you to write to us for a helpful booklet on how to get through depression.
[time=983] It's written by a fine author by the name of Charles Sell and I've leaned on his writings for my message today.
[time=991] I know there are insights and principles here that will help you spiritually to move your way through depression.
[time=999] And if you would like a copy, we would send it to you as a gift without any charge.
[time=1004] We encourage you to write today for this helpful booklet and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1017] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1026] We do want to encourage you to write and request the booklet on depression for yourself, for a family member, or for a friend.
[time=1034] It would be great preventative reading as well.
[time=1037] Knowing what causes depression and what solutions there are may help to ward off a coming depression.
[time=1044] So we do hope you'll write and at the end of the broadcast today, we'll give you our address one more time.
[time=1050] I would like to invite you friends who live in the greater Fort Wayne area to come and join us here at Blackhawk personally for what we're calling an open house.
[time=1059] As you old time friends who've watched us for a year or more remember, we were in an old building and God has blessed us with a new worship center and a new television facility.
[time=1070] We're sponsoring an open house inviting you friends to come and join us on January the 29th.
[time=1077] We are today moving from one church service to two.
[time=1081] Although there's an ice storm, we may not have our biggest crowd.
[time=1084] We're looking forward to growth in the days ahead and so we're providing for that with two worship services.
[time=1090] Our church services on Sunday morning are at 915 and at 1050.
[time=1095] And so as you think about coming to our open house on January the 29th, you'll need to plan on coming to either the first service at 915 or the second at 1050.
[time=1106] I hope you'll set that day aside.
[time=1108] You could even help us by praying for no ice storms on that weekend.
[time=1111] And then join us here at Blackhawk for our open house on January the 29th.
[time=1116] Before we go back to our worship service, Pete, would you share the address once again?
[time=1121] I guess we encourage people to write to us and tell us of their interest in the Bible hour and then write for the booklet to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1133] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1137] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1159] [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=1391] Thank you, Kevin and Denise.
[time=1393] We're thankful, Lord, that your love is so great.
[time=1397] We rejoice today that you care about us.
[time=1401] We marvel that you know us down to the details, even to the number of hairs that cover our head.
[time=1407] Father, we've come today to this place literally as a sanctuary.
[time=1413] We've come to find emotional and spiritual protection from the enemies of life. Many of us are battling grief, some discouragement.
[time=1429] Others of us are trying to ward off disappointment from unrealistic expectations.
[time=1437] Some of us are grappling with depression and its grip is greater than our own.
[time=1444] Thank you for a song today that would encourage us to know great is your love for us.
[time=1450] So first of all, we want to express to you our gratitude that you love us and that you care about us.
[time=1457] And we've come to give you our worship, to say that you are God, to honor you by honoring your word, by assembling today, to sing of the majestic character of your being. And we've come to get to get from you the resources of life's purpose and life's peace.
[time=1481] We pray for those today who are walking through the hard valleys.
[time=1485] We pray for Nick Joris' family as his mother goes through critical surgery and Carol Haberle as she goes through surgery.
[time=1493] I'm the same for Bobi Nuska. We pray for those who are recovering from hospitalizations like Doc Maudder, Dana Young, Daryl Good. We pray today for those who are suffering because they've lost loved ones, particularly Jim and Blanche Hindle, Joe Young and the children in Nancy's death. We pray for Dave Sudhoff and the loss of his father. That you as the God of all comfort would give peace to each one.
[time=1525] We pray for people who are hurt because their parents are suffering like Kathy Pierce. We pray for parents who are hurt because their children are suffering.
[time=1537] We pray that you'll give parents wisdom to know how to deal with young children as well as adolescents and even children who are adults though they don't act it. We pray you'll give them wisdom to know when to help and rescue and when to reserve and say no, you must learn the consequences.
[time=1557] We need wisdom. And as we face the gripping issues of doubt and discouragement, despair and depression we would ask you to teach us today in Jesus name.
[time=1569] [AMEN] Today we begin a two-week series on what the Bible says about depression.
[time=1581] For some of you today you'll say, hmm, I guess we do need to talk about it though it's not of interest to me. Life's a bowl of cherries but you may be married to someone whose life is a bowl of the cherry pits and could use a word of encouragement as well.
[time=1597] David who wrote many of the fine Psalms of Scripture writes some of the greatest words of exaltation and triumph that have ever been penned and he also strokes with that same hand some of the words that have come from the lowest emotional states that any of us will ever know. One of those occasions was Psalm 88. If you have a Bible open it please to the book of Psalms it's located just about in the middle of your Bible.
[time=1629] An Old Testament book that's a collection actually of songs that were meant to be sung. And some of these are songs of great majestic praise and worship. Some of them are lamentations, oh Lord help me.
[time=1645] Psalm 88 verse 1 O Lord the God who saves me day and night I cry out before you. May my prayer come before you. Turn your ear to my cry. For my soul is full of trouble and my life draws near the grave. I am counted amongst those who go down to the pit.
[time=1681] I'm like a man without strength.
[time=1685] I am set apart with the dead like the slain who lie in the grave whom you remember no more who are cut off from your care.
[time=1697] You have put me in the lowest pit.
[time=1705] David here describes depression as well as anybody I have ever read. He describes it characteristically and symptomatically.
[time=1717] He talks about the feelings of crying out. He's not simply calling for God he's not making a generalized prayer. He is calling out before God and he's pleading for God to hear him and he punctuates it with a lot of doubt. God I'm really not sure you're there to hear it.
[time=1733] He goes to the point of saying God, I've been forgotten. You don't remember me.
[time=1741] I've been cut off. I'm isolated.
[time=1745] I'm alone. The words go in a downward smile from crying to troubled to the grave to the pit.
[time=1757] He says it's bad and it can't be worse because you've placed me in the lowest pit of them all. Over the next two weeks we want to look at what the Bible says about depression.
[time=1773] We'll try to answer at least these three questions.
[time=1777] Is depression really real? Or is it actually the contrivance of modern science and behavioral studies?
[time=1785] If it's real, what are its causes and symptoms? And then thirdly, what are the cures? What can I do to battle this enemy? I want to begin by drawing our attention to a very simple question. Is depression real?
[time=1805] Because you'll find some extreme opinions, particularly from Christians.
[time=1809] There'll be an ultra conservative group who will say depression is not real. Depression is just a secular term to describe behavior problems that are rooted in sin. And depression is either sinful behavior, sinful thinking, or sinful emotions, and if you'll just deal with it spiritually, you will not have any emotional problems. There are other Christians who would come all the way to the other extreme and say, leave the spiritual out of it.
[time=1841] This is all a matter of biochemistry and it's all organic and you're not going to fix a broken arm by reading Psalms and you're not going to help me to press by reading Psalms either.
[time=1853] I, for one, find myself most often trying to find that point of balance and I hope we can achieve that today.
[time=1861] I find it necessary for me and perhaps not for all of you to take a few moments to defend the fact that depression is real because there's almost a hostility among some Christians towards the notion of any form of mental illness.
[time=1877] So, a quick journey through some insights of history and scripture, I think, may be helpful to all of us. First of all, I believe the Bible teaches us that depression is real. It is not just the contrivance of modern science and behavioral psychologists and sociologists.
[time=1897] Depression was first discussed or diagnosed by a man by the name of Hippocrates. You may have heard of the Hippocratic oath. He was a Greek father of modern medicine. He lived about 400 years before Christ and he diagnosed those who were given the fits of melancholy and mania. A melancholy is someone who is depressed, someone who is a maniac, is someone who is higher than a kite for no apparent reason and can't come down.
[time=1929] If it's anything, it's not new. It's more than 2,500 years old. But in the Bible, we encounter references to mental illness, both in the Old and in the New Testament. Deuteronomy 28, 28 is one reference I'll just quote for you in passing. It reads, "The Lord will let you with madness, blindness, and confusion
[time=1959] of the mind." So I don't think we have a strong leg to stand on that the Bible ignores mental illness, confusion of the mind, and various degrees. In the Old Testament, we meet individuals like Nebuchadnezzarah who God purposefully smote with an affliction that drove him absolutely insane as a judicial punishment for his arrogance in viewing himself as God. We meet a king by the name of Saul who many people read into it that he was either manic depressive, which means that some days he was manic and he was, I mean, he would attack the Philistines in a bold and daring move and the next day he would be so depressed he couldn't come out of his tent.
[time=2003] On some days he could put his arm around David and say, "David, you're just like a son to me, and on the next day you could aim a spear at him and throw it with an intent to kill." Others have diagnosed Saul as somebody who was paranoid, and I would certainly have to agree with that. The very mention of David's names literally drove him out of his mind.
[time=2027] Jeremiah was called the weeping prophet. He weaped because of the sins of Israel, but he had a predisposition to weep. He was a melancholy if there was ever a melancholy. In fact, one of his writings bears the name Lamentations, and if you need a sedative, this book will do it.
[time=2051] Allow me to quote one line out of Lamentations, "I remember my affliction and my wandering.
[time=2059] The bitterness in the gall, I will remember them, and my soul is downcast within me." Here's a spiritual man, a prophet, and his emotional state is that of a soul that is downcast within him.
[time=2079] David's writings reflect that often. We took a snapshot at Psalm 88 to get a picture of his own moods of depression. But allow me to draw your attention to Matthew chapter 26 for a moment, and let's take a look at the life of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2099] Matthew 26, verse 36, tells us of his agony in the garden. This is the night in which he was betrayed.
[time=2107] Matthew 26, verse 36, then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said unto them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray," and he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, that would be James and John, along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
[time=2131] That word "troubled" in the King James is the word "heavy." The Schofield Bible translates it "depressed," as does the expanded amplified version that Jesus was depressed. To grasp the mood even greater, listen to Jesus' prayer in verse 38, then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow, even to the point of death." In no way is Jesus suicidal, don't misinterpret it. He is simply saying that the sorrow, the grief, the anguish, the depression of his soul was upon him as heavy as death itself.
[time=2183] You see, the Lord Jesus was totally God, and he was totally man at the same time. You say that doesn't work out mathematically, of course not. It's theology.
[time=2191] It's not mathematics. You cannot describe God in numbers.
[time=2195] In the same Lord Jesus Christ, who got hungry because he was in a human body, was the same Lord Jesus who cried when his friend Lazarus died.
[time=2207] He was the same Lord Jesus who got tired. He was the same Lord Jesus who got depressed. There are many prominent people in history who have been depressed.
[time=2219] The great writer Shakespeare was probably a melancholy, and he wrote much of his own personality into his characters, and he called Hamlet that melancholy Dane.
[time=2231] Vincent Van Gogh, the great painter, hardly could scratch out a living.
[time=2239] None of his paintings sold for any significant price to long after he was dead. It was chronically depressed.
[time=2247] One time in a fit of depression, he attacked Paul Gogone.
[time=2251] In another mood of depression, he mutilated his own ear.
[time=2255] Churchill, the great statesman of England's World War II era, said that depression was a black dog that followed him every day of his life. And prominent Christians have been depressed.
[time=2271] Martin Luther wrote these words about one of his moods of depression. He says from his journal, "For more than a week I was close to the gates of death and hell.
[time=2283] I trembled in all my members. Christ was wholly lost.
[time=2291] I was shaken by desperation and blasphemy of God." That was the same Luther who stood in the face of an angry hierarchical church and said, "Sola scriptura! The scriptures only!" That was the same Luther who would wrestle through the scriptures and come to a declaration that man is justified by faith only and could start a movement that would change the course of the world.
[time=2319] He also knew the pits.
[time=2323] Great writers like C.S. Lewis and Spurgeon have written of their own depression. And so we've spent significant time today, but I needed for you to know that as a pastor, and as your pastor, that I believe that depression is real, that it's more than just not having all the right biblical verses tucked away to draw out of our reservoir.
[time=2347] Let's take a moment and talk about what depression is. Here's the description on the Booklet Depression that's published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Depression is the blues, the blaws, the pits. Down in the dumps under the weather, lower than a snake's belly. Just about anybody has a phrase, a favorite phrase to describe a depressed mood. In some ways the condition is almost like an object.
[time=2379] We know that its color is blue, gray, or black, or sometimes no color at all. But for the most part, people regard depression as a feeling, a mood, an emotion. As such, depression is a normal human experience. An unavoidable part of existence. Sadness, grief, frustration, discouragement, are the dark threads interwoven into the fabric of life.
[time=2407] Allow me to venture beyond my knowledge and my expertise. I'm only an expert at messing up. I was sent out to mess up, and I messed up on the way out. So I'm really venturing into some new territory here, but allow me from more of a psychological medical viewpoint to give you types of depression.
[time=2427] I think we can make this simple. You can break depression down into two groups. Normal depression and clinical depression.
[time=2439] Normal depression is something that we are all going to go through.
[time=2443] If your loved one just died, you're going to be depressed. In fact, you ought to be depressed. God has made you with a grieving process that has a purpose. If you lost your job, that's going to affect your mood. You can't say, "Yippie, skip me. I lost my job. I've got no income, and I don't know what to do with these bills. Isn't life great?" God hasn't made us that way.
[time=2471] There are normal depressions that are a part of life. But there is a deeper depression that goes far deeper than our normal reaction to things that are in and of themselves depressing. Here we're going beyond just a reasonable grief that an average person would experience over a depressing situation.
[time=2499] Now they even become a little bit more descriptive. In this depression, we can divide it into two as well. There is what's called, and it's somewhat of a technical term, unipolar depression, which simply means you're, instead of being in the balance, you gravitate extremely to one pole to one extreme.
[time=2519] And that is the extreme of depression.
[time=2523] There's bipolar, effective disorder as well, which means instead of just gravitating to one extreme, this day you're at that extreme and then your mood may swing slowly or suddenly to the other pole to the other extreme, and you are manic.
[time=2539] You've got more energy than anybody would ever imagine. And the swings may be daily or they may be long periods of mania and long periods of depression. So you'll meet somebody who, they are the best salesman in the world. You can't believe you've got them.
[time=2559] They've turned the sales industry upside down. They've taken their department from the bottom to the top. You can't believe what a salesman this guy is. And next year comes and you say, what happened to Fred?
[time=2571] Fred used to knock him dead and now, Fred's been knocked dead. He may be at some level of manic depression.
[time=2583] Perhaps that's what King Saul of the Old Testament suffered from. Even these can be broken down into conditions that are major functions. Are they are more of a long extended mood of dysphoria?
[time=2603] The symptoms.
[time=2607] This is my own composite list from several entries in what's called the diagnostic and statistical manual of psychiatry. Here are all 13 different things that are somewhat representative.
[time=2623] During depressive moods, there is a loss of interest and pleasure in almost all that is part of our usual activities of work or past time and accompanied by these symptoms, at least three or four. Insomnia, the inability to sleep or hypersomnia, the ability to sleep forever and not get moving. Most of us have insomnia at night and hypersomnia and insomnia in the morning and that's pretty typical.
[time=2655] Low energy are chronic feelings of fatigue, feelings of inadequacy, decreased effectiveness or productivity, be it at work, school or at home, decreased attention or concentration or the ability to think clearly.
[time=2671] Social withdrawal, loss of enjoyment in sex, restriction of involvement in pleasurable activities, gilled over past activities, feeling slowed down.
[time=2687] Less talkative and usual, pessimistic outlook towards the future are brooding over the past, carefulness in crying and a preoccupation, curiosity or attraction to death.
[time=2703] Those are some of the symptoms. The subjects, only 15 to 25% of us will go through major depression and all of the rest of us will go through it as a part of the natural processes of life.
[time=2719] If you're a woman, your odds of having major depression are two to one over men. If you are more highly educated and work in a more white collar industry, your odds are two to one that you'll get depressed over the rest of us.
[time=2739] We turn now to what are some of the causes and even hint at some of the cures today of depression. I'm going to divide them into three camps.
[time=2747] Physical causes, psychological causes and spiritual causes. On the physical side there's at least these three causes that I think are legitimate for us to consider. The first is genetics. You may have inherited a genetic predisposition towards depression.
[time=2767] It's hard to diagnose what is it that's a result of nature and what is it that's a result of how you were nurtured. Was it your father's genes or the genes your father put you in that made you depressed? It's hard to tell. But there is the strong possibility there's a genetic influence. Secondly, there is the biological factors of what are called neuro transmitters. We have a brain.
[time=2795] You may have held that in doubt about some of the people here but it's been proven that we all do have one. It is made up of millions and millions of brain cells and our brain is not like a computer. Each one of those individual brain cells is like a computer in and of itself.
[time=2811] And these computers need to talk to each other. You've got a brain cell here and a brain cell here and they need to communicate and they communicate through what are called neuro transmitters.
[time=2827] John White said it's like there's an army outpost over here and another army outpost over here and a neurotransmitter is a dispatch writer that goes between the two. And as long as you have enough dispatch writers who are willing to work over time, everything functions quite smoothly.
[time=2843] But if you have a lot of dispatch writers that said nope, we're retiring.
[time=2847] We've run enough missions.
[time=2851] Or your body doesn't produce enough dispatch writers. Suddenly the connection between those cells is not going to be proper and that is a major cause of depression. You may have heard in more of the whole medicine studies that come out on shows like Good Morning America of things like norepinephrine and dopamine.
[time=2871] Those are neurotransmitters that complete the communication from cell to cell and when they're not there, depression will be.
[time=2879] A third biological concern is very similar to that and that is the working between the brain function and the other endocrine systems of our body.
[time=2891] For example, your pituitary gland or reproductive gland or your thyroid gland or your adrenal glands all produce chemicals and hormones that all work together in a cycle and you start interrupting that cycle and you're going to start affecting the emotional and mental disposition of the person. Because of that, there are medical cures for depression if you have a medical cause for depression.
[time=2919] Now if your depression is caused over the fact that you are genuinely and rightfully guilty over sin, no medical cure is going to help that.
[time=2931] But if your problem is medical, then the medical cure will help.
[time=2935] There are two types of medical treatment that are most common. One is medication and there are two types of medication. There are medications that actually help to replenish the neurotransmitters or help to keep those retiring dispatch writers going.
[time=2951] You've got a chemical problem and here's a solution to get those chemicals working and in my opinion I believe that every Christian who has been diagnosed by a doctor of having a neurotransmitter problem ought to take the medicine the doctor says is going to help you. If you're suffering from manic depressive, we have learned that in urn salts can help to restore a balance and lithium will be a great help to you and you ought to take that medicine. There are other medications that do not help to restore neurotransmitters but they simply help to mask the symptoms and I am a little bit more cautious in that field.
[time=2995] There's a second medical therapy called electric shock therapy and many of us when we hear that we think that took place in the medieval days and torture chambers.
[time=3007] That's what happens to you in Siberia if you don't go along with the party.
[time=3011] We get these images of torture and abuse and please allow me to correct that.
[time=3019] We don't always know why it works but in the most severe cases of depression that has often been the thing that has worked and the only thing that has worked. It has handled very medically very scientifically and very appropriately and many people in our church have been helped by it. I mentioned that in the first worship service and a couple came up just to reassure me that their family had been through that and that it indeed had helped.
[time=3051] Let me move quickly to the more psychological causes of depression.
[time=3055] The first one is what we'll call object loss. That does not mean I lost my teddy bear and I'm not going to be happy till I found it.
[time=3067] By object loss we mean the loss of anyone or anything that we hold near and dear to us.
[time=3075] Let me give you the top ten of one survey.
[time=3079] Death of a child, death of a spouse, a jail sentence, unfaithful spouse, made your financial difficulty, business loss, being fired, miscarriage or still birth, divorce and marital separation.
[time=3099] When we go through those and dozens of lists like them we are going to go through what's called secondary depression. We're not depressed for some primary reason. This bad thing has happened to us and this bad thing is depressing and God has made us such that we should be depressed. Let me dab a little bit further into this though. One writer has rightfully said that our object loss can take four forms. It can be the loss of something concrete.
[time=3131] I lost my job. I lost my child.
[time=3137] Who has died. Or it can be more abstract.
[time=3141] I've lost my self-worth. I've lost my pride.
[time=3145] I've lost my sense of drive.
[time=3149] It can be and I want to focus on this thing. Many people I meet live with unrealistic expectations and when their expectations aren't meant they go through the process of loss even though they never had it. Never should have thought they'd get it but now they are depressed because they didn't.
[time=3173] An individual wakes up. He's 40 years old. He thought he was going to be president of the company at age 35 and he is now a second level of every clerk and he's depressed because his expectation was up here. It was unrealistic and he is suffering the loss of what he should have never expected in the first place. Unrealistic expectations will trip you every time and an object loss can also be threatened. You live with a spouse who's always letting you know that if things aren't more their way in the future they just may not be here with a boss who is constantly letting you know that there's going to be cutbacks the threatened object loss.
[time=3217] A second psychological cost is personality.
[time=3221] I think we can overstate it but we are born with somewhat of a disposition towards some basic personality temperaments. One of those is a sanguine. A sanguine person is always up, they're always happy, they're always laughing, they're always chuckling and they got depressed one time for almost two minutes.
[time=3241] And the other person is the individual who is a melancholy and no matter how good things get they want to know what's the possible downside.
[time=3253] The sanguine's a little boy who on Christmas, his dad told him his present was the barn, he ran out to the barn, found a pile of manure and said this is great with this much manure there's got to be a pony someplace.
[time=3265] The melancholy's the individual, his dad says there's a present for him the barn, he runs out and he sees the pony who's always one and he said who's got a shovel after this thing. We have some basic temperaments.
[time=3277] A third psychological reason is what I will call because I can't find a better term than the one I've read a depressed,ogenic environment.
[time=3289] You may have been raised in this environment or you may be raising your children in this environment. If you wanted to press child be a perfectionist take the report card and when they got six A's and two B's say what's this B business?
[time=3305] Always let them know not how well they done but how they could have done better.
[time=3311] Little boy was listening to his dad in his perfectionistic tone tell him all the things that Abraham Lincoln accomplished as a little boy and the same when little lad looked up and he said dad and when Abraham Lincoln was your age he was President of the United States of America.
[time=3327] Balance.
[time=3331] If you want to raise a depressed child let them know that your love is conditional based upon performance. If you perform well I love you. If you don't perform well I've got several ways I can withhold it. I'll withhold telling you it, I'll withhold showing you it, I'll withhold any type of reward so that you'll perform better. That's the best way to raise a depressed child. Two more psychological causes that I put as transitional to spiritual causes.
[time=3363] The first is self-esteem. A low self-esteem will contribute to depression in a great way. It's hard to tell am I depressed because I have low self-esteem or I have low self-esteem because I'm depressed.
[time=3375] The chicken or the egg.
[time=3379] Self-esteem can be taken completely out of whack. I know that.
[time=3383] But allow me to try to give one simple verse I think puts it in balance.
[time=3387] Philippians 4.13 Paul said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. You see if you're going to have good self-esteem you better never doubt for a moment that you can do it and you never better believe for a moment that you can do it without Christ. If you keep those two things in mind you'll go a long way to solving the problem of self-esteem.
[time=3415] The final reason that I'll bring to you today is what I'll call cycles of negative behavior.
[time=3423] We think about the wrong things and we start behaving the wrong way and then all of a sudden we don't feel so good.
[time=3431] Listen to Philippians 4. Finally brothers what's whoever is true what's whoever is noble what's whoever is right what's whoever is pure what's whoever is lovely what's whoever is admirable think on these things. Next verse and whatever you have learned and received and seen in me put these into practice and then the God of peace will be with you. When you think biblically and then you act biblically you start to feel the biblical beyond promises.
[time=3463] It's been a pleasure for us to once again share the musical ministry of our sanctuary
