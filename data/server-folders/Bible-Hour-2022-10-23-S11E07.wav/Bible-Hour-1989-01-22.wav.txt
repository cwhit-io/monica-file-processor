[time=90] (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) (bell ringing) Depression is often the effect of guilt.
[time=120] Shakespeare personified that in his character, Lady Macbeth.
[time=125] After she had conspired to the death of the king, so she could become the first lady.
[time=131] She was overwhelmed with grief and remorse to the point of deep gloomy depression.
[time=137] In her hand, she saw the blood of Duncan, and she cried out.
[time=143] Out spot, out I say.
[time=146] All the perfumes of Arabia cannot make this hand clean again.

[time=167] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=169] Thank you for joining us.
[time=170] Rick's message today is entitled, "What the Bible Says About Depression, Part Two." Depression is often a secondary effect, arising from guilt as its primary source.
[time=181] In Psalm 32, David vividly describes the dark side of sin's consequences.
[time=187] Today in our second and final study on what the Bible says about depression, we will explore the spiritual causes of depression.
[time=195] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=199] Rick's text is taken from the Book of Psalms, chapter 32.
[time=203] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in Psalm.
[time=207] [MUSIC]
[time=209] Other special music includes a duet from Keith and Starr Bratigum.
[time=214] And a song from Rejoice.
[time=219] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort White, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=227] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=232] Now here's Rick.
[time=234] We're glad you're here, so welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=240] We trust that as we worship together, God will speak to your heart through music, through His Word, and draw you one step closer to a walk that is moment by moment, walking with Him.
[time=252] Our choir leads us in worship by singing that song moment by moment.
[time=258] [MUSIC - 193 seconds]
[time=470] What a promise we have until we reach the promised land that God indeed will give us strength for the day.
[time=476] No one ever cared for me like Jesus, him number 528.
[time=480] We'll sing the first and third stanzas together of this very personal hymn, him number 528.
[time=487] I would love to tell you what I think about Jesus.
[time=509] [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=641] Let's continue with music now as Keith and Starr Brodigam sing for us.

[time=1398] [ Pause ]
[time=1408] >> Joshua 1-8, "Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night,
[time=1418] so that you may be careful to do everything written in it." Joshua 1-8, "Thank you, you may be seated." >> Thank you, Dale, and I'm thankful for each one today who would make it a priority of their life
[time=1434] to memorize God's Word.
[time=1436] Would you join me now as we honor Him by praying together?
[time=1440] Our God and our Father were thankful that you've given to us a book, a law, a standard to live by, that gives to our life direction.
[time=1450] And so we've come even this morning to honor you and your Word that we might be the beneficiaries
[time=1457] of the wealth of the treasury of knowledge that's in it.
[time=1461] We come to you today to acknowledge that we need you.
[time=1466] We need your forgiveness.
[time=1468] We confess both corporately and individually that we are sinners,
[time=1474] that we need your forgiveness.
[time=1476] We've come today to experience the cleansing and the joy of being renewed.
[time=1482] And so we today ask you to wash away all of our guilt.
[time=1487] We've come today to refan the flames of allegiance so that our hearts might not grow cold,
[time=1494] but instead burn with loyalty to you.
[time=1497] Pray today that you would inspire us to have convictions that will carry us beyond just this hour,
[time=1504] but will be a reference point for life.
[time=1508] As we come to you today, we come to give to you our praise, our worship,
[time=1514] but we are obsequious.
[time=1515] We do it because we know we will receive even greater blessing from you.
[time=1520] We pray today for your comfort, for Jeff Paraguay.
[time=1524] She learned yesterday of the death of her brother in a plain accident, for Pete Geiger and the loss of his older brother.
[time=1533] We still continue to think of the hurts of the Hindus and the young, and ask you to support and comfort them.
[time=1542] We pray this morning for our nation.
[time=1545] That you would give to us collectively a sense of responsibility, not just for ourselves and our appetites, but a responsibility as a nation to please you.
[time=1557] We thank you today.
[time=1559] You've given us a life.
[time=1562] We ask you to give us the insight to treat it as sacred.
[time=1566] We pray for those ministries today like the Crisis Pregnancy Center and the Baptist Children's Hall.
[time=1573] The stand is an alternative to the tragic epidemic of abortion in our country.
[time=1580] We pray that you will teach us today to number our steps so that they please you.
[time=1586] In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1591] If you brought a Bible with you today, I'll be opening mine to Psalm 32 and invite you to do the same.
[time=1599] We're studying on two Sundays, last Sunday, and today what the Bible says about depression.
[time=1607] Psalm 32 gives us insight as to one of the causes of depression.
[time=1613] Penn by David, who was writing by inspiration of God.
[time=1617] Here is a man who as writes as though he had one hand on the pulse of humanity
[time=1623] and the other on the pulse of God.
[time=1625] He communicates for us to God all of the human experiences and feelings that we have, and yet he brings back from God a fresh word of how we can cope with those experiences of life.
[time=1638] Psalm 32.
[time=1641] Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
[time=1649] Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.
[time=1657] When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
[time=1665] For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me.
[time=1671] My strength was sapped as in the heat of summer.
[time=1677] Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity.
[time=1685] I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave me the guilt of my sin.
[time=1694] Therefore, let everyone who has godly prayed to you while you may be found.
[time=1701] Surely, when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.
[time=1708] You are my hiding place.
[time=1711] You will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance.
[time=1717] In this passage, David gives us some insight on depression.
[time=1723] This morning, I would like to invite you to probe with me five spiritual causes of depression.
[time=1730] But before we do that, can I review for you some concepts we had last week?
[time=1735] If you're like me, you remember everything except for the stuff that you forget.
[time=1740] That's becoming a longer list in my case.
[time=1743] Allow me to review for just a moment that last week we divided the causes of depression
[time=1749] into three categories, physical, psychological, and spiritual.
[time=1756] I think it's important for you to hear from me that I believe that there are physical causes of depression.
[time=1765] I think you need to hear that from me, not because I'm so smart or I'm a doctor because I'm neither.
[time=1770] But to most of you, I am your pastor and you have a sense of trust with me of what the Bible teaches.
[time=1777] There will be others and I hold them in high esteem who will say, no, there's no physical cause.
[time=1782] It's just all spiritual. I don't believe that.
[time=1785] I believe that you can have physical caused depression from at least one of these two resources.
[time=1792] Perhaps there's a genetic factor that it is inherited.
[time=1796] Just like I inherited my curly hair, the hawks have curly hair for generations.
[time=1803] My mother said she almost didn't get my baby picture taken because it looked just like my grandfather's.
[time=1809] My dad's is the same way. I inherited that.
[time=1813] You can also inherit perhaps some genetic conditions that make you, if not more prone, at least slightly susceptible to depression.
[time=1824] There's another biological or physical cause.
[time=1827] You may remember last week we mentioned what are called neurotransmitters.
[time=1832] Our brain has millions and millions of cells, each one of them like a computer.
[time=1837] And the computers have to talk. It's like two army outpost stations in the Old West
[time=1843] and the dispatch writers would go back and forth.
[time=1846] Neuro-transmitters like Norepinephrine and Dopamine go back and forth.
[time=1850] And when they retire early or go and leave without allowance, our moods will change and depression may be a cause.
[time=1859] A third biological factor could be it's those neurological functions combined with the rest of our endocrine system.
[time=1867] The thyroid or the pituitary are the adrenal glands.
[time=1870] All those glands and others produce chemicals and hormones that all have to mesh together in balance.
[time=1878] And when one of them's off, the rest of them may have problems as well.
[time=1883] Leave it to say that there are physical causes and sometimes medication and in some cases,
[time=1889] electrical shock therapy is all that is able to work and to help.
[time=1895] We talked about psychological causes. Primary among those are what we call object loss.
[time=1901] The loss of someone or something that is near and dear to you, you will have moods of discouragement and depression
[time=1911] as you face the death of a loved one. The reality of a divorce.
[time=1918] The loss of a job. Bankruptcy. Perhaps it's more subtle. Moving out of a home that's secure into a brand new state or country.
[time=1931] All of those things may trigger that mood. It may be more of a psychological temperament.
[time=1938] Some of us tend to be sanguine. We are just happy. We're not sure why, but we're happy. We're born happy.
[time=1943] We'll die happy. The people we bump into may not be, but we will be happy.
[time=1949] There are other people that their basic temperament is more melancholy. They're more analytical.
[time=1955] And they see the problems before they see the good.
[time=1959] It could be that you grew up in a depressogenic lifestyle.
[time=1965] The people around you were depressed and they taught you how to be depressed.
[time=1970] But what I would like to do today is move importantly to the spiritual causes and cures of depression.
[time=1979] Please don't misunderstand. When I give something that I think is a remedy for a spiritual cause, that will not cure a depression that is physically rooted.
[time=1989] Memorizing Scripture will not replace nor epinephrine in your body chemistry.
[time=1996] What we're talking about now are spiritual causes and spiritual solutions for that type of depression.
[time=2003] We're leaving the more clinical depression to the more routine depression.
[time=2009] We're not so much talking about those who are formally diagnosed as depressed, but those of us who are down in the dumps or under the doldrums or have the blues or the blaws.
[time=2020] Like Churchill, we feel like a black dog is following us about the nip our heel every day.
[time=2027] Five spiritual causes to consider. First and foremost out of Psalm 32, guilt may cause you to lose the joy of your life.
[time=2039] Psalm 32 has a sister passage. It is Psalm 51 where David in both Psalms writes out of the experience of sin in his life.
[time=2049] In Psalm 51, he says, "Restore unto me the joy of my salvation."
[time=2056] Both of those deal with sin, guilt, and forgiveness.
[time=2061] Guilt can trigger a loss of joy and even depression in our lives.
[time=2071] A man went to bed night after night, night after night incapable of sleeping.
[time=2078] Finally one night he got out of bed. He wrote out an anonymous letter, stuck cash in the envelope and mailed it to the IRS with this explanation.
[time=2088] "I am unable to sleep. I am discouraged and depressed. Here is some money that I owe you."
[time=2095] P.S. And if I can't go to sleep now, I'll send you the rest of the money that I owe you to.
[time=2104] Most of us want to negotiate how we can overcome the guilt and the mood that comes of depression because of that guilt.
[time=2112] Here in Psalm 32, David gives some great insight. Our Western mind always moves in a logical pattern that follows Aristotle.
[time=2123] And this is Hebrew. Aristotle would start with the causes and then the cures and then the results.
[time=2130] Here we start off with the results. Verse 1, "Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven.
[time=2139] Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him."
[time=2145] David says, "I am finding what it is that makes a happy and full life.
[time=2150] I am discovering what it is that makes my life blessed." I think it's fair for us to exchange the word blessed here for the word happy or content or rich or full.
[time=2163] How do you have that life? David says, "I have that life because my sins are forgiven.
[time=2169] My transgressions are blotted out. God's not holding them against me anymore."
[time=2176] In verses 3 and 4, he gives the causes for a lack of happiness.
[time=2183] When I kept silent, my bones wasted away.
[time=2191] Through my groaning all day long, for day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
[time=2198] My strength was sapped as in the heat of the summer.
[time=2203] David says, "When I kept silent, when I took my sins and I internalized them,
[time=2210] I refused to acknowledge and confess them.
[time=2213] The result was I had no strength.
[time=2219] My bones were wasting away inside of me." Here is a man that looked at a 9 foot 9th giant like Goliath.
[time=2229] Armed with nothing but stones in the Spirit of God, he said, "I'll take you on.
[time=2234] All of Israel's armies may stand back and tremble and shake, but one on one I'll take you on." There is a man that new strength and vitality.
[time=2244] Now he is a man who says, "My bones are wasting away within me."
[time=2250] It speaks of a lethargic condition that comes from an emotionally depressed mood.
[time=2257] He goes on to say, "Your hand was heavy upon me." He knew where the weight of it was coming from.
[time=2264] The burden was not the problems that were out there.
[time=2267] The burden was the problem that was in here because God's hand was heavy on him.
[time=2273] He says, "Every day, every step, I am sapped."
[time=2280] Like the heat of the summer, do you remember last June and July, 100 plus degree temperatures, not a cloud in the sky for 30 days?
[time=2289] I mean it was just work getting into a car or out of a car or going from one place to another.
[time=2296] It was exhausting.
[time=2297] The heat was oppressive.
[time=2300] David said, "I felt like that on the cool days of life."
[time=2306] Now the cure.
[time=2309] Verse 5, "Then I acknowledged my sin to you.
[time=2315] You did not and did not cover up my iniquity.
[time=2318] I said I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
[time=2326] Therefore, let everyone who has Godly pray to you while you may be found.
[time=2331] Surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him.
[time=2336] You are my hiding place.
[time=2338] You will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance." Here's a man that goes from sapped like the heat of the summer to heavy hand upon him
[time=2349] all the way to a turnaround where he says, "I've got a song in my heart.
[time=2353] I'm just singing through life." Songs of rejoicing.
[time=2357] Songs of deliverance.
[time=2359] What was the transition?
[time=2362] He said, "It came about when I changed from covering up my sin
[time=2368] to acknowledging it and confessing it before you."
[time=2374] Guilt has an amazing effect upon our lives.
[time=2380] It affects us not only spiritually but emotionally.
[time=2386] David escaped the burden of his emotional problems when he was spiritually restored to God.
[time=2396] Pythagoras had a student.
[time=2398] He was a Greek philosopher from whom we get the Pythagorean theorem.
[time=2402] His student went to a cobbler and had a pair of shoes made, but didn't on that day have the funds to pay for the shoes.
[time=2410] But he asked the cobbler, and the cobbler agreed that he could take the shoes if he came back within a few days and paid for them.
[time=2417] The student honored his promise and came back in a few days to pay the cobbler only discovered that the man had died.
[time=2425] And now the student realized he had both the shoes and the money and no one else knew of the debt.
[time=2431] He walked away rejoicing that he had new shoes and he didn't have to pay for them.
[time=2436] But he said that every time he heard his shoe hit the hard pavement, he could remember that he owed that debt.
[time=2443] And he went back to the cobbler's house and threw the money in the window and said, "Though the cobbler is dead to all the world, he is still alive to me."
[time=2454] Just when you thought you had gotten away with it all and nobody knew your conscience was still alive
[time=2464] and the Spirit of God awakens it and says, "Though that may be unknown to all the world, it is still alive to you and to me."
[time=2475] Here David gives the simple prescription that is timeless and true, that if we acknowledge our sin, God will forgive it and he will not count our transgressions against us.
[time=2489] But in our human nature, confessing our sins comes hard.
[time=2496] Our instinct is when we sin rather than to say, "I was wrong, I am sorry, I did it."
[time=2503] It's to somehow cast the blame somewhere else, or minimize it and explain it away with some justification.
[time=2511] It's as old as human nature.
[time=2513] God came to Adam the very first time sin entered the universe and said, "Adam, what did you do?" And Adam said, "I can pass this buck." It was the woman that you gave me.
[time=2526] God said, "Eve, what did you do?" And she said, "It was the serpent that you created.
[time=2534] I can pass this buck." And our human nature is when we have sinned is to cast the blame somewhere else.
[time=2543] And that is not confessing it.
[time=2547] Confession is not saying, "I did it, but somebody else really influenced me." Everybody else was doing it.
[time=2555] Let me suggest these three steps to complete confession.
[time=2559] Step number one is recognizing that sin is sin and calling it such.
[time=2564] Step number two is repenting from our sin.
[time=2568] It's not only saying, "Yes, I did it yesterday," but it's saying, "Yes, I did it yesterday, and today I am changing the course of my life so that it won't happen tomorrow."
[time=2582] Confession does not say, "Yes, I did it yesterday, and I've got some wonderful plans for tomorrow, too."
[time=2589] The story is told about this teenage boy who went to confession.
[time=2593] He confessed one of his sins to the priest, and the priest said, "Well, I need to know who your partner was with you in this crime." The little boy said, "Well, I can't tell you." And the priest said, "Was it so-and-so?" He said, "Nope, what was it so-and-so?" "Nope, why about such-and-such?" "Nope, little boy ran out of the confessional and said to his buddies, "Whew, got through that one." He said, "Well, did you have to tell them?" "No, not only that, I got some good leads for next time." A lot of us come to the Lord like that.
[time=2620] We want to confess it, but we're not ready to give it up either.
[time=2624] We've got some good plans for the next time.
[time=2627] That is not repentance.
[time=2629] The third step is restoration.
[time=2634] Not only can I say that it's wrong, not only can I order my step so that I'll walk right,
[time=2640] but how can I fix up the past?
[time=2643] Sometimes there's nothing you can do, and we admit there's nothing you can do.
[time=2647] But what if there is something you can do, then we're responsible to do all we can to make it right?
[time=2654] Let me give you an illustration.
[time=2655] Suppose I borrow money from you at the promise that I'll pay you back in one week's time.
[time=2660] One week goes by, two weeks go by.
[time=2662] Three weeks go by, and I'm avoiding you on every turn.
[time=2665] Finally, we come face to face, and I recognize my sin.
[time=2670] I say, "I'm really sorry.
[time=2671] I owe you the money, and I should have paid it back, and I apologize.
[time=2675] I've recognized my sin." Suppose I even repent, and I say, "I'll not only tell you that I'm sorry.
[time=2682] I'll not only do that, but I promise you I'll never borrow money from you again and not pay it back."
[time=2688] You say, "That's fine." And I say, "Goodbye." You're probably going to say, "Well, what about the money you owe me?
[time=2695] Pay that back.
[time=2697] That's restoration." When there are sin in our lives, and all of us are marked by it, we must confess it.
[time=2705] We must turn away from it, repent, and then we must do what we can to make it right.
[time=2712] There's a second cause, spiritual cause, of depression that's a hitchhiker on guilt.
[time=2720] It is false guilt.
[time=2723] False guilt treats us symptomatically the same way as real guilt.
[time=2728] False guilt can come from a number of sources.
[time=2730] False guilt can come through some faulty thinking on our own.
[time=2735] A parent says to their teenager, "That sounds like a good plan.
[time=2739] You can ride with your friends to the high school basketball game." The two high school students get in the car, they drive safely down the street.
[time=2748] Somebody else runs a stop sign and hits them and their son is killed.
[time=2754] And now the parent goes through the false guilt of saying, "I should have never let him get in that car."
[time=2761] That is not guilt.
[time=2763] That is false guilt. You act prudently and properly and things beyond your control happen,
[time=2770] but our emotions don't often distinguish that and they start producing guilt.
[time=2774] "I should have done something. I could have prevented this. It is my fault."
[time=2780] And it's not true.
[time=2782] False guilt can come from another source.
[time=2784] It can come through faulty training as we have grown up or even as adults.
[time=2789] Things like this, big boys don't cry.
[time=2792] And then when we as big boys show our emotions, we feel guilt.
[time=2796] But the truth is big boys do cry.
[time=2800] John 1135 is the shortest verse in all the Scripture and it says this, "Big boys do cry." It says two words, "Jesus wept." There's an old spiritual that says, "If Jesus had to pray, then what about me?"
[time=2819] And the next thing is, "And if Jesus had to weep, then what about me?"
[time=2826] But one of the greatest sources of false guilt that I know of are churches and preachers.
[time=2834] This one included.
[time=2836] False guilt comes from us as Christians because we often take what God said,
[time=2843] then what we think, and we squeeze what we think under the general heading of God said it,
[time=2849] and now there are people out there who have great guilt over breaking man's commandments
[time=2855] when they should not.
[time=2857] Colossians 2 addresses this, "Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world,
[time=2863] why as though you still belong to it do you submit to its rules? Do not handle.
[time=2869] Do not taste. Don't touch." These are all destined to perish with the use because they are based on human commands
[time=2879] and teachings.
[time=2881] Such regulations indeed appear to have wisdom with their self-imposed worship,
[time=2889] their false humility, and their harsh treatment, but they lack any real value.
[time=2896] That was not a philosopher, that was God's word, warning us about false guilt.
[time=2902] The only remedy for false guilt is a lot of corrective self-talk where we say, "I realize that that is not God's standard, and if I choose to operate differently than a brother or sister,
[time=2915] I can do that. I can breathe without feeling guilty."
[time=2921] The third cause is what I want to focus on strongly.
[time=2925] I'll call it secular values.
[time=2929] Turn to Psalm 73.
[time=2931] This is not a psalm of David, but it's an insightful psalm about oppressive and depressed moods.
[time=2939] By secular values, I mean this.
[time=2942] That we have our value system so oriented with the secular world
[time=2949] that it's a completely different value system than God's.
[time=2953] Materialism, point of order.
[time=2957] Here's Psalm 73, verse 1, "Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart,
[time=2964] but as for me, my feet had almost slipped.
[time=2969] I had nearly lost my foothold." How did that happen?
[time=2975] Verse 3, "For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
[time=2981] They have no struggles. Their bodies are healthy and strong.
[time=2987] They are free from burdens common to man.
[time=2990] They are not plagued by human ills.
[time=2993] Therefore, pride is their necklace. They clothe themselves with violence.
[time=2998] From their callous hearts comes iniquity.
[time=3000] The evil conceits of their minds knows no limit.
[time=3004] They scoff and they speak with malice.
[time=3008] In their arrogance, they threaten oppression.
[time=3011] Their mouths lay claim to heaven and their tongues take possession of the earth.
[time=3016] Therefore, their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.
[time=3021] And they say, "How can God know? Does the most high-up knowledge?"
[time=3028] This is what the wicked are like.
[time=3030] They always care free. They increase in health and wealth.
[time=3036] Surely, in vain have I kept my heart pure.
[time=3039] In vain have I washed my hands in innocence.
[time=3042] All day long I have been plagued. I have been punished every morning.
[time=3049] If I had said, "I will speak thus, I would have betrayed this generation of your children."
[time=3057] Then I tried to understand all this. It was oppressive to me.
[time=3063] Till I entered the sanctuary of God, then I understood their final destiny.
[time=3077] Here's an individual who looks around and he says, "Life ain't fair.
[time=3083] I'm over here trying to please God. I'm trying to do the right things.
[time=3086] I've kept my heart pure." Look at that guy.
[time=3090] I mean, he shaves corners. He cuts dirty deals. He lies.
[time=3094] He is mean. He is violent. And that guy gets ahead every day.
[time=3098] He gets a little bit richer. Did you see his house?
[time=3100] I'd be happy to move into his garage. It's fantastic.
[time=3104] See his house. Did you see how he gets to his house?
[time=3108] I mean, those wheels cost more than your house in mind.
[time=3111] And he sees the abundance of the wicked and he says, "Wow, I want all that.
[time=3119] I should have that. I'm tired of walking with God." Notice the exaggeration and the distortion, the literal feeling that the grass is always greener.
[time=3129] He says, "They always increase in their wealth. They're never sick.
[time=3133] They don't have a care in the world. They're on the easy street all day long.
[time=3138] Hell for me. Life's been rough.
[time=3142] I've had it real bad. Not only does he exaggerate the good things that the evil man has but is for himself.
[time=3149] He's never had a break in his life. No one's ever helped him one time.
[time=3154] And he's confused and he can't sort through it.
[time=3157] And he's about to deny the Lord and betray a whole generation.
[time=3161] He says, "It never made sense until." He says, "Until I went into the sanctuary." And he said, "Then I saw the final end." He said, "Then I discovered this principle.
[time=3174] Always live in view of eternity."
[time=3180] Secular values will come into our life and say, "If you'll just follow this plan, you'll get ahead."
[time=3187] But God says, "Always live in view of eternity."
[time=3193] And most of us are caught in the trap of secular values.
[time=3197] That more pleasure, that more things, that more prestige will make us happy.
[time=3201] Let me give you the typical American cycle.
[time=3204] I am down. I'm discouraged. And I want to feel good.
[time=3208] In the United States of America, we have two solutions for that.
[time=3212] Eat something or buy something. One of the two will work.
[time=3215] So here's an individual. They're down and they're depressed.
[time=3218] And they say, "I just feel so blue. I don't know what I'm going to do." I know what I'll do. I'll go to the mall.
[time=3227] Off to the mall they go and they get to the mall and they see all kinds of things.
[time=3231] "Oh, I'd be happy if I bought this, but they don't have the ability to buy with this." And MasterCard says, "The two of us can do it." So we buy it. And we feel, "Oh, I don't feel so blue anymore." And we walk out looking at that charge slip.
[time=3245] And on the way out of the mall, we're saying, "How am I going to pay for this?" And now we're down lower than we were down because we're not only depressed over the original issue, but now we're depressed over the debt we've heaped on top of them.
[time=3256] We said, "What am I going to do? A banana split will help me." A banana split will get me through this. And so we eat that banana split.
[time=3263] And halfway through that, our body's releasing this in dorphins and the chocolate is so good.
[time=3268] And we feel good. And then it hits about the lower half of the indigestive track.
[time=3274] We go, "Oh, I don't feel so good. I'm depressed. I'm broke and I'm overweight."
[time=3282] [laughter] That new outfit I just bought can't button.
[time=3289] What am I going to do? I'll go to the mall.
[time=3292] And the cycle starts all over again.
[time=3296] And in the bathroom, there's a scale that tells us it isn't working.
[time=3300] And in the kitchen, there's a list of bills that says it's not working.
[time=3304] But our secular values will say, "If you just buy one more thing, if you just have one more pleasure,
[time=3310] if you just get one more not chick head, then you'll be happy." And we just chase ourselves around the cycle of secular values that says pleasure is the cure to everything.
[time=3320] And we fail to make our decisions always in view of eternity.
[time=3327] A fourth possible cause. Psychologists call it anger turned inward.
[time=3332] The Bible calls it bitterness.
[time=3336] Freud, Abraham's from a secular viewpoint said that much of our depression is because we are anger on the inside
[time=3343] and we don't know how to direct it on the outside. God says, "Yes, it's called bitterness.
[time=3348] I am harboring anger in my heart, and the only cure for bitterness is to extend forgiveness."
[time=3356] The Bible says, "See to it that no root of bitterness springs up in you and by it many be defiled.
[time=3365] If you're like me, you have an enemy in your front yard that occurs every May.
[time=3370] It is the perennial dandelion.
[time=3374] My whole self-esteem rests upon their absence from my front yard.
[time=3378] Backyard I don't care about. Front yard no dandelions.
[time=3382] Dandelions have roots that go down.
[time=3386] And you can run over there and you can pull the top of the dandelion off and he'll be up to greet you tomorrow morning.
[time=3393] And if you don't get the root out, he'll not only live there, but he'll spring forth with a head that will go to blossom
[time=3399] and it'll just be driven by the wind and he will have more children, cousins, in-laws and relatives than you'll ever imagine.
[time=3408] And bitterness is identical.
[time=3411] The only way to get the root of bitterness is to forgive the person who hurt us.
[time=3417] And if we don't, it'll be back tomorrow.
[time=3420] And if we don't get it tomorrow, it'll very soon go to seed and replace in our husband, our wife, our children, our friends.
[time=3427] Our fellow employees were happy until we started to tell them how the boss mistreated us.
[time=3433] How unfair this company is and it can spread faster than the measles or the mumps.
[time=3438] It's more contagious than the flu or a cold and it can only be pulled out by forgiveness.
[time=3444] The fifth and final spiritual cause of depression can be demon possession or demon oppression.
[time=3452] Four quick comments. One, it is possible.
[time=3455] Two, I've never once in my 12 years of pastoral counseling said that I think this depression is demonically influenced
[time=3462] and neither has one of our counselors who I checked with.
[time=3466] Thirdly, we see it in the Bible because we see all of Satan's demons at one time in space and time
[time=3472] being launched against Jesus Christ and there was a fury of demonic activity.
[time=3477] Can it happen today? I believe it can.
[time=3480] I just think that the fourth point needs your attention.
[time=3484] Many times we want to say, as Flip Wilson used to say on his show, the devil made me do it,
[time=3490] but we'd like to have our problems at a point where we could blame them on somebody else.
[time=3496] And we'd like to have our solutions be if somebody would just pray the right prayer, this would all be over.
[time=3502] I've not found that to be the case.
[time=3505] Depression is...
[time=3521] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our Sanctuary Choir, Keith and Starr Brontagum and Rejoice.
[time=3530] The message today was a message of encouragement from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3535] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3543] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3545] Dear Heavenly Father, I know today that I'm a sinner and that I need to have Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3554] I ask you to cleanse me today and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior.
[time=3561] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3565] If you made a commitment today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
