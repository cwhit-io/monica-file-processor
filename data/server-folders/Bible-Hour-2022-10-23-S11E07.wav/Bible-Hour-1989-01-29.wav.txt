[time=108] To be or not to be, that is the question whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms
[time=123] against the sea of troubles and opposing and them to die to sleep no more and by asleep we say an end to the heartache and the thousand miseries that flesh is heir to
[time=144] to a consummation devoutly to be wished to die to sleep those famous words of hamlet ring through the centuries of the contemplation of an individual to die to sleep to end their own life and suicide
[time=167] but that's not a century old question because the media today in Time magazine asked this question is suicide contagious
[time=177] [MUSIC]
[time=189] Welcome to an hour of Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible hour. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled what the Bible says about suicide
[time=201] The thought of suicide is foreign to most of us. It causes us to turn the channel to avoid its intrusion into our homes by way of the evening news. We avoid it out of a mixture of fear and repulse.
[time=214] Maybe it will go away if I don't look, we tell ourselves, but the next cycle of the news deposits the issues of suicide in our minds as predictably as the waves deposit unsightly seaweed on the beach.
[time=226] It won't go away. Could it be contagious? Today on the Bible hour we will study what the Bible says about suicide. It is refreshing to find encouragement for those who live with feelings of meaningless and hopelessness.
[time=241] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us. The Sanctuary Choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=250] Other special music includes a selection from the Sanctuary Orchestra, a solo from Brian Losen, and a song from the Men Singers Quartet.
[time=263] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=272] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you. Now, here's Rick.
[time=280] We welcome you this morning to our second worship service, delighted that you've come to worship the Lord Jesus with us.
[time=288] We want to welcome our friends who join us for the Bible hour. And trust that whether you're in the hospital and the jail and a home are here in this auditorium, you'll know that Jesus Christ is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and that He is forever King.
[time=318] [MUSIC - 216 seconds]
[time=562] [APPLAUSE]
[time=569] Wherever King, your everything, what a testimony. Continuing our thoughts on Jesus today as we sing Him number 79, Jesus the very thought of the, we're saying the first two verses together, please.
[time=583] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=653] Thank you very much for your good singing. You did sing very well today. Black Hawk, we believe in Psalm 150 where it talks about all the instruments that joined together to praise the Lord. You've got an instrument that you're interested in playing, that is in our orchestra.
[time=670] You just signify it on the registration card or call us during the week. We're grateful for our choir and their ministry, and now the orchestra has played for several months, and we're just delighted that people give their talents to serve Him this way.
[time=684] Listen, as the orchestra plays, a mighty fortress is our God.
[time=696] [MUSIC - 194 seconds]
[time=917] [APPLAUSE]
[time=925] We would like to take this opportunity to thank you again for joining us here today for the Bible Hour. We've had this day set aside as an open house, inviting our friends to come in and join us in person. And we're looking forward after the service of meeting many Bible Hour viewers.
[time=941] As Rick, this is always a special time. My neighbors are with us, and I know that a lot of our friends and members have invited their friends to come with us and join with us on this special day.
[time=952] Well, we're sorry if you are at home today and not able to be here in person, but don't wait until a special day every Sunday is a unique opportunity to worship, and our doors and our hearts are open to you. And we'd like to invite you to join us any Sunday for one of our two morning worship services.
[time=970] We worship at 9.15 and at 10.50 in the morning, so pick the service that works into your schedule the best and come and join us in person.
[time=980] Also, during these days, we're taking a survey of our viewers. We're trying to find out what is the best time for us to broadcast the Bible Hour. Here in Fort Wayne, it's at 7 a.m. on Sunday mornings is our prime broadcasting time.
[time=995] But there's a possibility of changing that time, but we want to know from you when is the best time for you to watch the Bible Hour.
[time=1003] So we'll be mailing out a survey to all of the people who are part of our television family, and if you would like a survey and you haven't received one, I want to encourage you to write to us today, and we'll send you a survey.
[time=1016] Please know that the purpose of our survey is not to collect your name and address so that we can put you on a fundraising list.
[time=1023] We sincerely want your input on this survey. In fact, if you don't want your name used for mailing, we will not use it.
[time=1032] We want your input, and that's sincerely why we're doing the survey. So if you'd like a copy of our survey, please write to us.
[time=1040] You can receive a copy of the survey by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1051] It's very important that we hear from you, so we encourage you to write, and once again I'll give you the address.
[time=1056] It's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1064] Thank you, Pete, and we do hope that many of you, literally hundreds of you, will write in for this survey, because the validity of the survey is really based upon the numbers.
[time=1074] We can't make decisions or try to influence stations with a survey of 5 or even 50, but if hundreds of you would respond, that would be a great, great help to us.
[time=1085] And while you're writing in, please ask for a helpful booklet entitled "Griefs Healing Process."
[time=1092] Today as we study God's Word, we're going to look at what the Bible says about suicide.
[time=1098] And often people go through a mood of hopelessness, of grief, and they say, "There's no reason for me to live. Nothing matters anymore."
[time=1108] But God has given us grief, and it has a healing process, and if we allow grief work to complete in our lives, we will come through those dark days.
[time=1119] Many of you are probably suffering the loss of a loved one, or the demise of a relationship, or you're going through grief in some fashion.
[time=1128] This book will go a long way to providing some of the hope and some of the healing that you need.
[time=1134] Again, we want to encourage you to write for this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1143] The zip code is 46815. That's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1154] Thank you, Pete, and we are thankful that you've joined us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1160] As we go back to our morning worship service, we look forward to the ministry of music again.
[time=1165] Brian Lawson will be singing for us. He has a tremendous baritone-based voice, and I'm sure that he will minister to our people as well as those of you that are watching.
[time=1173] And I recognize your tie. That means the quartets about the sing as well.
[time=1176] They'll be singing just before the message.
[time=1178] That's something to look forward to. Thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1190] A language of Jesus is love. Just one word can bring healing and light
[time=1204] to each heart that has honored for kindness and truth through the trials and the triumphs of life.
[time=1218] A language of Jesus is love. It tells the greatest story ever told.
[time=1232] Such grace and tenderness, dear words, could not express the language of Jesus is love.
[time=1253] I could speak with a tongue of an angel and still have nothing to say.
[time=1267] I could tell of this world and its wisdom, but my words would just get in your way.
[time=1281] There's a language that's learned by the Spirit and it's spoken with actions of care.
[time=1295] For the aching heart, Jesus' healing starts when heaven's love is shared.
[time=1309] A language of Jesus is love. Just one word can bring healing and light
[time=1322] to each heart that has honored for kindness and truth through the trials and the triumphs of life.
[time=1336] A language of Jesus is love. It tells the greatest story ever told.
[time=1350] Such grace and tenderness, dear words, could not express the language of Jesus is love.
[time=1374] Just one word can bring healing and light to each heart that has honored for kindness and truth
[time=1388] through the trials and the triumphs of life. A language of Jesus is love.
[time=1403] It tells the greatest story ever told. Such grace and tenderness, dear words, cannot express the language of Jesus is love.
[time=1431] A language of Jesus is love.
[time=1448] It's love.
[time=1465] Our God and Father, we thank you this morning that you love us.
[time=1472] Our hearts are captured by a beautiful song, melody and a rhyme that would remind us that you love us.
[time=1480] We're thankful for the promises of your word that God does love this world.
[time=1487] We're thankful for songs that we learned as children. Jesus loves me. This I know.
[time=1494] And yet, Father, there would be those today who would carry a burden of life that their heart would doubt even today, that you know, that you care, that you love.
[time=1506] And so we come to this sanctuary, hearing a song that you are a mighty fortress, and we've come to plead to you today for protection.
[time=1516] We pray that within the inner man you would strengthen us. You'd give no hope and enthusiasm to a heart that is weary.
[time=1524] God, we would ask you today to comfort those who battle fierce enemies like cancer. So we pray for herb and Catherine and our dean, Joyce.
[time=1534] We ask you today to strengthen the self-esteem of those who have been deflated by the locks of a job or the criticism of a boss or the remark of a colleague.
[time=1546] God only you can give strength to the inner person. We pray for those today who are discouraged or who doubt, or perhaps even who are depressed.
[time=1557] May they find in you a reference point, an anchor, a fortress. But God, we also come to thank you for those moments or even extended days when we soar like the eagles.
[time=1570] We fly. You've increased our blessing, and we want to thank you.
[time=1577] But God, we've come also to give to you our worship and praise. We are human, we are selfish, and we come and tell you of our burdens.
[time=1585] But God, we want to tell you that we love you today, that we want to shout forth the greatness that you are King, Lord Jesus, and that we've come to worship you.
[time=1594] And even now as we study your word, we invite you to be the one who teaches, who speaks to our hearts.
[time=1609] Everyone who is thirsty for water, those who are seeking for refuge are blind.
[time=1630] Come and be filled with his tender compassion, Jesus, the Savior divine.
[time=1651] Come to the water.
[time=1662] Come to the river of life.
[time=1672] Come to the mouth of the fountain.
[time=1682] Jesus, the Savior divine.
[time=1693] Everyone with a heart of repentance.
[time=1708] That may be found, though you have wondered in sin, he will cleanse you.
[time=1723] Jesus, the Savior divine.
[time=1733] Come to the water.
[time=1743] Come to the river of life.
[time=1753] Come to the mouth of the fountain.
[time=1762] Jesus, the Savior divine.
[time=1802] To be or not to be.
[time=1806] That is the question, whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
[time=1816] or to take arms against the sea of troubles, and by opposing them to die, to sleep.
[time=1828] No more, and by asleep we say an end to all of life's heart aches and miseries.
[time=1836] It is a consummation devoutly to be wished, to die, to sleep.
[time=1845] To be or not to be those famous Shakespearean words put in the mouth of Hamlet raised the question,
[time=1851] is life worth living?
[time=1853] Are there affairs that are so outrageous in the fortune of life that we'd say suicide is really my best option?
[time=1861] To be or not to be, it's really a question.
[time=1863] I have to struggle today.
[time=1865] Do I want to live?
[time=1867] Or do I want to die?
[time=1869] But then more than it's a page out of English literature, out of Renaissance writing, it's one of the issues of life today.
[time=1879] The statistics are alarming.
[time=1882] Since 1950, there has been a 3-400% increase in death by suicide amongst the young people of our society.
[time=1893] In 1955, 4 out of every 100,000 young people between the ages of 19 and 24 chose to take their own life.
[time=1905] In 1985, the number went from 4 to 12.3.
[time=1911] This morning, we would like to examine the Bible in search of what God has to say.
[time=1917] What does the Bible say about suicide?
[time=1920] To give you a simple outline of where we're going today, we'll want to talk about the situation, and then the scriptures, and then ultimately the solutions that God would have.
[time=1931] The situation is alarming. I've shared some of those statistics with you of the rapid growth in the amount of people
[time=1939] who are choosing to take their lives because they feel that life is helpless and that is hopeless,
[time=1947] and there is no meaning for their tomorrows.
[time=1951] While the rate has risen amongst young adults, it has stayed high amongst those in the middle of life,
[time=1957] but the most likely candidate today to take their life as that adult was somewhere around 70 to 75 years of age.
[time=1967] They're the ones that choose the most often to say, "It is helpless. It is hopeless. I have no meaning to my life."
[time=1976] The situation is so concerning that we are asking this question today.
[time=1982] It is suicide contagious. Time magazine asked that question and then gave an answer in their February 24 issue back three years ago.
[time=1993] It says, "Is suicide contagious? Recent clusters of adolescent suicides suggest that the answer is yes."
[time=2003] In a 12-month period beginning in February of '83, 17 majors in Plano, Texas committed suicide
[time=2011] four by carbon monoxide poisoning, three by guns.
[time=2016] Five boys in New York's Westchester and Putnam counties died by their own hand in February '84.
[time=2025] For them by hanging, within recent weeks, one student committed suicide in Spencer, Massachusetts.
[time=2036] At least two other schoolmates, possibly four, tried to kill themselves, but failed.
[time=2044] Is suicide contagious? Yes.
[time=2048] Actually, we are at risk this morning to even talk about the subject of suicide.
[time=2053] No matter how no more intentions, no matter how accurate our advice, no matter how clear our warning, don't do it.
[time=2062] The very subject itself becomes bait to those who are despondent and depressed.
[time=2069] It is contagious.
[time=2071] It is infected to our society through at least these three avenues, the media, the movies and the music.
[time=2080] The media, doing their very best to inform and to warn a society, brings into our living rooms the reality of suicide
[time=2089] and the message is played in front of the mind of one who is vulnerable.
[time=2096] Here's what the Journal of American Medical Association says.
[time=2100] Physicians should be especially attuned to possible suicidal feelings or behavior during the week of a publicized account of suicide.
[time=2112] The New England Journal of Medicine echoes an even stronger warning.
[time=2118] Our results indicate that the national rate of suicide amongst teenagers rises significantly just after the television news
[time=2127] or feature stories about suicide.
[time=2131] The increase is proportional to the amount of network coverage.
[time=2137] It's not just the news that tells us the harsh realities of life, though they try to warn us that bait the vulnerable.
[time=2144] There are movies, television shows that bait us as well.
[time=2150] As you watch a television show, you go through a very simple process called projection.
[time=2155] Do you remember being a little boy? I can remember it clearly, watching the Lone Ranger.
[time=2159] When you're a little boy, you don't sit and watch the Lone Ranger.
[time=2163] You wear your hat, your holster and gun, your silver bullets, your black mask that stands for truth and justice
[time=2173] and most of all, anything becomes a faithful steed, high-o silver.
[time=2179] And you bounce as you watch that show and you shoot the bad guys because as a little boy, you project yourself right into that character
[time=2186] and you do what that character does.
[time=2189] I remember that. I did that last week on the reruns of the Lone Ranger.
[time=2194] But it's not just little boys, little girls do that.
[time=2197] We recorded the Wizard of Oz. I'm driving down the street.
[time=2200] And just one of my daughters in the back seat goes, "Are you a good witch or a bad witch?"
[time=2206] "Well, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy from Kansas." She ran through and she was Dorothy. She had a little basket with a stuffed dog inside it named Toto.
[time=2215] And she was Dorothy. We project ourselves into the characters we see on television.
[time=2221] And many of us begin to identify with a despondent or a depressed character in a situation on television or on a movie.
[time=2231] And when we see their lives fall apart, we feel ours falling apart.
[time=2235] And when we see their despair, we feel our despair. And when they take their life, we take ours.
[time=2243] The BBC ran a soap opera called The Easterners. One of the primary characters, Angie, attempted suicide on this show by an overdose.
[time=2254] The week following that broadcast, the increase was from 23 to 46 people who attempted to take their lives by an overdose in the hospital at Nottingham.
[time=2268] The majority of them women, the majority of them at the same point of life as the fictitious Angie and the majority of them through an overdose.
[time=2278] We have life, imitating art.
[time=2282] But the most alarming and frightening is what comes to us through the music.
[time=2289] I had heard that there were various songs that were coming through the airwaves of heavy metal that spoke about suicide.
[time=2297] I was alarmed to discover how many and how blatant.
[time=2302] Groups like Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Aussie Osborn all speak openly and blatantly about suicide.
[time=2316] A few illustrations. A group by the name of Eddie in the Hot Rods has an album called Teen Depression.
[time=2322] What's the title? Teen Depression. The cover is a young man with a gun pointed to his head.
[time=2329] Aussie Osborn has made a name for himself by being barbaric and overtly satanic.
[time=2338] The titles of his songs reflect that, but the most gripping is the one that says suicide solution.
[time=2348] But what could be more grim than AC/DC? Here's the words to their song.
[time=2354] Put me to your head. Pull the trigger.
[time=2358] Do it now. Shoot the thrill. Shoot the kill.
[time=2364] I say to you as young people who love music, I'm one who loves music.
[time=2370] You need to guard your ears because there's a message there.
[time=2373] Whether you consciously pick it up or not, there's a message there.
[time=2377] When I say that as a parent, I believe that we are wise to say, "You can't listen to that." You may say, "Well, they'll sneak into it. Well, then let them sneak into it." But you don't have to condone it. You need to take a protective stand.
[time=2391] We need to watch what comes through the music, what comes through the airwaves, because there's a whole generation that's saying, "I don't know how to live." And the Pied Piper's telling me, "I'll show you how to die." Suicide solution.
[time=2406] Alarming days. But they're not new days.
[time=2410] Suicide has been around since Hamlet. It's been around longer than Hamlet.
[time=2414] The famous Greek Socrates took his own life by drinking the poison hemlock.
[time=2420] They viewed it as noble, but God is ignoble.
[time=2424] Let's turn now to the scriptures. Does the Bible address the subject of suicide?
[time=2428] Well, if you have a Bible today and you want to follow, we're going to make our fingers do the walking.
[time=2434] We can't turn to one single passage and say, "Well, here's a passage in the Bible about suicide." There are many.
[time=2441] I'll read them for you or I'll give you their account if you want to follow you may.
[time=2447] We'll go from front to back to make the journey a little easier.
[time=2450] The first is a man by the name of Abimalek.
[time=2454] Abimalek's story is told in Judges chapter 9 and verse 50.
[time=2460] Judges 9 verse 50.
[time=2462] Next to Abimalek went up the thebes and besieged it and captured it.
[time=2466] Inside the city, however, was a strong tower to which all the men and women, all of the people of the city fled.
[time=2473] They locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof.
[time=2476] Abimalek went to the tower and stormed it.
[time=2479] But as they approached the entrance of the tower to set it on fire, a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull.
[time=2489] Hurdly, he called to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me." So they can't say, "A woman killed him." If nothing else, this passage shows the irrationality of suicide.
[time=2502] But here is a man, warrior, filled with pride, attacking a city, making a name for himself, and he is fatally injured.
[time=2512] Or at least he feels that and calls upon his sword bearer to help him commit suicide.
[time=2518] A more famous passage is found in Judges chapter 16.
[time=2522] It's the story of Samson.
[time=2524] The strong man, physical power, supernatural, gifted by God.
[time=2530] But though he was strong physically, he was not strong spiritually.
[time=2534] He was a lot like Mark Twain, who said, "I can resist anything except for temptation."
[time=2540] That was Samson.
[time=2542] And did Lylus seduced him and conned him into betraying his own best interest?
[time=2548] She founded his strength in his hair and his obedience to God, and she cut his hair.
[time=2554] He lost his strength through disobedience, and he was captured by the Philistines, and they made a mockery of it.
[time=2559] They chained him, and they whipped him, and they beat him.
[time=2563] They paraded him through their streets.
[time=2565] They gorged out his eyes, and they made him the symbol of their military victory.
[time=2571] They're having a big celebration, and they say, "What a better way to celebrate than to taunt this great Samson one more time."
[time=2580] So Samson is brought out, and he has God to restore to him his strength just for one moment.
[time=2586] Samson asks the little boy who leads him out, "Put me near the pillars that uphold the building."
[time=2592] A lot like those pillars back there, not to make you who are sitting under the balcony nervous, but we are trying to fill up the front row.
[time=2601] Samson put his hands on the two pillars, and before he pushed them out, demonstrating a supernatural strength,
[time=2608] he said, "Let me die with the enemies of God," and he collapsed the building down around himself,
[time=2615] taking his own life purposefully.
[time=2618] Another biblical account is that of King Saul in 1 Samuel 31.
[time=2622] Saul is wounded in battle, he fears the Philistines shall capture him, and he says to his sword bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me, lest the Philistines do."
[time=2632] The sword bearer thought for a moment, "If I make it out of here alive and I go back and they found out I killed Saul,
[time=2638] things aren't going to go well." And he refused, and so Saul drew his own sword.
[time=2645] He placed a handle on the ground and point up and leaned on it until he pierced himself to death.
[time=2651] The sword bearer turns and looks and see what happens.
[time=2655] He realizes it's his job to protect the king, and he turns the sword on himself and he takes his life.
[time=2661] There are two moral testament accounts of suicides.
[time=2664] One is a man by the name of a Hithofil.
[time=2667] If you don't like your first name, at least thank your parents that they didn't name you a Hithofil.
[time=2672] His story is found in 2 Samuel 17.
[time=2676] He is an ally and compatriot of David.
[time=2680] Absalom starts a revolt, and a Hithofil switches his allegiance from David to Absalom,
[time=2688] and he begins to be a fine strategist, giving good advice to Absalom,
[time=2694] but now his advice is not heeded, and he knows that David will win.
[time=2699] Absalom will be defeated and a Hithofil captured.
[time=2703] And so it tells us this in chapter 17 in verse 23.
[time=2710] When a Hithofil saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey, set out for his house in his hometown.
[time=2719] He put his house in order and then hanged himself, so he died, and was buried in his father's tomb.
[time=2729] The Old Testament were told of a man by the name of Zimri.
[time=2732] Zimri wanted to be king.
[time=2734] He followed a usual historical plan, and that is he knocked off the king, appointed himself king.
[time=2741] The people heard about this, turned against him, and they made Amri, the commander of the army, and Amri, and the army pursued Zimri until they cornered him in the palace, and Zimri burnt the house down on top of himself, taking his own life in the process.
[time=2760] The most famous suicide in the Bible is that of Judas Iscariot.
[time=2765] Judas is a enigma.
[time=2768] It could be that Judas is exactly what we think.
[time=2771] He is a low, down, dirty traitor who never had a good intention in his bones, and after he betrayed Christ he was so grief-stricken he hung himself.
[time=2781] It could also be, however, that Judas really believed that Jesus was the Messiah, and that Jesus was going to overthrow Rome, and he grew impatient of Jesus throwing the Romans out.
[time=2791] And he thought what I'll do is I'll betray Jesus.
[time=2794] That will force him to use his supernatural power.
[time=2797] That will force him to drive the Romans out.
[time=2800] Whichever theory you hold to, we do know that Judas betrayed Christ.
[time=2805] After that occurred, his guilt and his grief became so great he returned to the scene of the crime, to his co-conspirators, and he offered to return the thirty pieces of silver, and they refused it.
[time=2817] Made him keep his own blood money.
[time=2820] He walked away and ensured grin and dismay.
[time=2823] He threw the coins on the temple floor, and he went out, and he hung himself.
[time=2829] Those are seven biblical accounts of suicide.
[time=2833] Let me make four observations on them for you.
[time=2836] First and foremost, each one of these people who took their lives took their lives at the end of a life of spiritual rebellion.
[time=2846] None of these people were walking under the Spirit.
[time=2851] None of these people were striving to please God, they were all living in rebellion.
[time=2856] Judas the Betrayer, a Hithofil the insurrectionist.
[time=2861] Samson, the weak of Spirit.
[time=2865] Zimri, the lust for power.
[time=2869] A Hithofil, the pride of life, as a bimilec.
[time=2876] Secondly, please note that the Bible condones none of their actions.
[time=2883] Various societies, particularly the ancient Greeks, made of Socrates a hero because he drank the poison hemlock.
[time=2890] The Bible knows nothing of making a hero out of one who would take their own life.
[time=2896] The Bible makes no statement about suicide, but includes it in the general, clear statement of the Ten Commandments, "Thou shall not kill."
[time=2908] The Bible never condones suicide.
[time=2913] A third observation I would make is that each of these people took their life at a moment when they felt absolutely hopeless.
[time=2923] Saul said, "The Philistines are going to get me, it is hopeless." Zimri said, "I've been cornered, it's hopeless." A bimilec said, "I'm dying, it is hopeless." Judas said, "I'll never find forgiveness." He was wrong, but he felt that.
[time=2940] He said it is hopeless.
[time=2943] A fourth observation that we would make about each of these is that only a Hithofil and Judas appeared to have premeditation.
[time=2953] The rest of them did it in the heat of the battle and the spur of the moment, but Judas tried to absolve his guilt.
[time=2963] In a Hithofil, the Bible says, "One home to put his house in order."
[time=2970] There is an important clue for us who would want to help those who are depressed and even considering suicide.
[time=2978] Usually there are signs of the individual putting their house in order.
[time=2983] Here's what the Journal of American Medical Association says are, "Some of the signs of putting a house in order, feeling isolated. Nobody likes me. Nobody cares.
[time=2994] I'm not important. I won't be missed." Giving away prized possessions, withdrawal from regular friends and regular activities,
[time=3006] talking about suicide.
[time=3009] 75% of the people, according to another study who attempted to take their life, had talked about it openly to somebody before their attempt.
[time=3018] Insomnia or hypersomnia, eating habits changing, taking unnecessary risks.
[time=3027] Those are things to watch for those who are putting their house in order.
[time=3032] But as we look at the scriptures, let's not just leave it that here were some wicked men who were craving power.
[time=3039] Here are some spiritually people walking out of fellowship with God.
[time=3042] They're the only ones that get to spend and are depressed.
[time=3045] We all get to spend and are depressed.
[time=3048] And some of the heroes of the faith who are walking with God had death wishes.
[time=3053] Let me give you three.
[time=3054] One was Moses.
[time=3056] Moses had led the nation of Israel.
[time=3059] You want to talk about a hopeless situation.
[time=3061] Hello, what's your name? Moses?
[time=3063] Moses, what's your job leader?
[time=3065] What are you trying to accomplish?
[time=3066] We're just wandering around here 40 years to all my friends die.
[time=3071] Someone of a depressing role.
[time=3075] And Moses is in the middle of all this wandering.
[time=3077] God has provided manna from heaven.
[time=3082] And the people say, we're sick of it.
[time=3084] We are sick of manna.
[time=3087] You know what we'd really like?
[time=3089] We'd like some meat around here.
[time=3091] And Moses gets frustrated.
[time=3092] He is depressed.
[time=3093] He is despond.
[time=3094] He says, God, I can't take it.
[time=3096] It's hopeless.
[time=3097] I can't feed all of these people.
[time=3100] God, I want to die.
[time=3103] Just let me die, God, please.
[time=3109] Elijah came off of a great spiritual victory and at the end of his spiritual victory, Queen Jezebel found out that Elijah had done in her phony prophets.
[time=3119] And Jezebel is not a lady you would like to know.
[time=3124] And Elijah flees for his life.
[time=3126] He's hiding in a cave and he says, God, it's hopeless.
[time=3131] Jezebel is going to get me.
[time=3133] I want to die.
[time=3137] A third individual may surprise you.
[time=3140] This is not a down and outer.
[time=3142] This is an up and outer.
[time=3144] You know, those of us who have the most are often the ones who need the most.
[time=3150] We have it all on the outside, but we need the most on the inside.
[time=3154] Solomon, he had everything.
[time=3156] He had wisdom.
[time=3157] He had power, pleasure, prestige and prominence.
[time=3160] Not a bad grocery list.
[time=3163] And here's how he described life in Ecclesiastes chapter 4 verse 2.
[time=3168] Then I declared that the dead who already died are happier than the living who are still alive,
[time=3175] but better both than both as he was not yet been born.
[time=3180] He was not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
[time=3185] Solomon had it all.
[time=3187] One of the things that he had was a recognition that his life was meaningless and it was empty.
[time=3196] You can boil down the emotions that lead to suicide primarily to these two.
[time=3203] Deep feelings of hopelessness and deep feelings of meaninglessness.
[time=3209] Very few of us here will ever seriously contemplate suicide, but almost every one of us here will
[time=3216] go through repeated episodes where we say, "I can't stand my job.
[time=3220] It's meaningless.
[time=3221] No matter how well I do, they think I could have done better.
[time=3226] No matter what I try, it doesn't work.
[time=3228] I can't please the boss." We'll go through points where we say, "What difference does it make?
[time=3233] No matter what I do, my kids rebel.
[time=3236] Hawks can stand up there and give out all this easy advice, but I can't wait until his kids are teenagers.
[time=3242] My life is meaningless as a parent.
[time=3245] I can't make a difference." We will all go through periods of helplessness and hopelessness.
[time=3253] Who is most vulnerable at that time?
[time=3255] Well, here are some things to consider.
[time=3258] The most vulnerable are those who have gone through or are now going through a family crisis.
[time=3265] 71% of the youth who attempted suicide are from broken homes.
[time=3270] 75% of the teens from broken homes felt guilty and responsible for their parents' divorce.
[time=3278] Those who have abused drugs and/or alcohol or have witnessed the same in their family.
[time=3286] A third characteristic, those who have been abused physically, sexually, verbally or through neglect.
[time=3294] Fourthly, those not living with their natural parents, finally those facing a black anniversary.
[time=3301] The anniversary of a divorce, of the death of a loved one, of a broken relationship, a failure of business.
[time=3310] But let's turn a moment to some solutions.
[time=3313] What solutions can we offer today for those who are feeling helpless and hopeless?
[time=3319] Let me suggest them in two simple categories.
[time=3322] Spiritual principles and spiritual people.
[time=3328] The one focuses on what you need to know and to think.
[time=3332] The other focuses on what you need to feel.
[time=3335] It's very important that you go through a process called cognitive therapy where you change your thinking and your beliefs.
[time=3342] Because if you tell yourself you're not doing very well, you'll soon believe you're not doing very well.
[time=3347] And you'll soon act like you're not very well and then you'll feel like you're not very well because you're not very well.
[time=3354] You can talk yourself into it.
[time=3357] You need to think on these lines.
[time=3360] First of all, you need to think that suicide is unacceptable to God.
[time=3365] He considers it murder, he considers it a sin, he considers it's wrong.
[time=3371] Secondly, you need to think and know that God holds you accountable for your life.
[time=3375] Hey man, I'm a Christian, God will forgive me anything.
[time=3378] God may forgive you, but you'll still have to give an account for your life.
[time=3382] 2 Corinthians 5 says to believers in Christ, we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=3388] God's not going to stand there and say, "Oh, I understand everything." He's going to say, "What have you done with the life that I've given you?" Thirdly, you need to know that God uses the tough times and the trials in our lives.
[time=3401] Yes, he says that he will walk with us through the tough times, but he also says we will walk through tough times.
[time=3410] You need to expect it in the plan on it.
[time=3413] God didn't invite us to a birthday party that would never end.
[time=3418] James 2 tells us that we will go through trials.
[time=3421] Roman 8 says that God uses everything, even the bad things, ultimately for good, but he doesn't say they will always feel good.
[time=3430] You need to know that God promises that he will walk with us even through the valley.
[time=3437] He said, "I'll never leave you alone. I'll never forsake you." No matter how helpless or hopeless you feel, God says, "I will not leave you helpless.
[time=3447] I will not leave you hopeless, but when you go through the fire, I'll go with you.
[time=3453] When you go through the flood, I'll go with you." You need to know that meaninglessness in life does not come through suicide, but it comes through surrender.
[time=3465] The secular psychologist Meninger said, "The best way to cure depression is to lock your back door."
[time=3471] He didn't trust his neighbors.
[time=3473] And go out your front door and give yourself a way to somebody else.
[time=3477] Preoccupation with your own problems is a trap.
[time=3482] Finally, spiritual people. We need people who care about us.
[time=3487] It's more important that we care than we do.
[time=3490] It's more important than we listen than we talk.
[time=3493] It's more important than we walk alongside than we try to change.
[time=3498] But each of us need people, people who love us.
