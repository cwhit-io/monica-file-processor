[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=90] The subject of money is one of the most penetrating topics we can consider.
[time=114] On the one hand, it's our least favorite subject to discuss and on the other, it was Jesus' most preferred topic.
[time=122] In the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, over one-sixth of all that Jesus had to say,
[time=129] focused on the subject of money.
[time=132] Hadn't Robinson put it this way.
[time=134] Jesus spoke on money matters because money matters.
[time=140] [MUSIC]
[time=153] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=156] Thank you for joining us.
[time=158] Rick's message today is entitled, "What the Bible Says About Money." Money is one of the most, if not the most sensitive subject in religion today.
[time=168] We choke on how it is raised, and gag on how it is spent in the name of religion.
[time=174] The headlines have made hot hands out of some who should have the coolest minds.
[time=179] It is a struggle, but not as much publicly as it is privately.
[time=184] The subject of money stirs our hearts.
[time=187] Occasionally with guilt, or at least causing us to question our own motives.
[time=192] Please open your Bibles to 1 Timothy 6, verses 17 through 19.
[time=197] As we study what the Bible says about money, the sanctuary choir and orchestra will be ministering to us in song.
[time=206] Other special music includes a solo from Marilyn Wong and Tim Teder.
[time=214] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=220] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=224] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=229] Now here's Rick.
[time=231] Welcome this morning.
[time=232] We're glad that you're here.
[time=234] We also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=238] We've come today to declare that Jesus Christ is our Lord.
[time=242] He has come once, and he died on the cross for our sins.
[time=246] But the Bible declares that he's coming again.
[time=249] And how different that will be the next time he comes.
[time=272] From the lofty courts of heaven came upon on earth to bloom,
[time=281] knowing when he left his father, that his fate would be the tomb.
[time=291] But the grave, it could not hold him.
[time=295] And he has rolled the stone away.
[time=300] Now the mighty rolls of Sharon is still gloaning yet for day.
[time=309] [MUSIC - 148 seconds]
[time=470] [APPLAUSE]
[time=476] You know Christ is your savior.
[time=478] You indeed can say amen to that fact.
[time=480] That the next time he comes, he'll be coming for me.
[time=483] He'll hail the power of Jesus' name number 96, please.
[time=488] Him number 96.
[time=491] Sing together the first, third, and fourth stanzas.
[time=495] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=643] We're indeed grateful for music.
[time=647] Thank you for participating in this way in our worship service.
[time=650] If you were here just before the service started, you heard Glenn Basham and David Johnson play a duet and the stringed instruments and I'm sure it was a blessing to your heart.
[time=660] We're indeed grateful for that.
[time=661] We continue with music now as Marilyn Wong comes to sing a song certainly depicts how we all feel.
[time=668] We are not worthy of the love and the favor that he's shown upon us, but we are indeed grateful.
[time=674] I am not worthy.
[time=676] [MUSIC]
[time=684] I am not worthy the least of his favor, but Jesus left heaven for me.
[time=697] The word became flesh and he died as my Savior, forsaken on dark, cavalry.
[time=714] I am not worthy this Dalton repeats it, I am not worthy this heart gladly beats it.
[time=728] Jesus left heaven to die in my place.
[time=737] What mercy would love and what grace.
[time=748] I am not worthy the least of his favor, but he is preparing a place where I shall dwell with my glorified Savior.
[time=766] Forever to look on his face.
[time=775] I am not worthy this Dalton repeats it, I am not worthy this hard, hard repeats it.
[time=790] Jesus left heaven to die in my place.
[time=800] What mercy would love and what grace.
[time=819] What a privilege it is for us to come into your home or your hospital room or perhaps even your jail and to share with you the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=829] We are delighted that you would give us this opportunity to talk together.
[time=833] Pete, I trust this past week was a good week for you.
[time=836] Yes, Rick, we missed you around the church, but it was somewhat of a tranquil week.
[time=841] We got a few things done on our new building, some volunteers came and helped paint and just do some of the finishing touches of our worship center.
[time=849] I assume you had a good week.
[time=850] We did and it was nice of you to say that we were missed, but to be in our nation's capital and to see our heritage was really an honor and a privilege for Kathy and for me.
[time=859] It's a very interesting area in which to be.
[time=861] It really is and it couldn't have stirred my heart more with gratitude to our God for his great blessing on our country.
[time=868] And to see those war memorials like the Vietnam War Memorial and then some of the more familiar points like the Lincoln or the Washington monuments just reminded us of the great price that Americans have paid for our country's freedom.
[time=881] And we are thankful to God that he has blessed us here.
[time=885] One of the blessings we have is that of religious freedom to be able to declare today the Lord Jesus Christ and to be able to talk to you by way of television.
[time=894] That is a rich blessing that God has given to us.
[time=897] We want to encourage you friends who join us for the Bible Hour to write to us for our Bible Hour Survey.
[time=905] We're asking you to write so that we could send to you a survey that would ask you questions for your input about things like what's the best time to broadcast the Bible Hour?
[time=915] What channel do you watch it?
[time=917] How often do you see it?
[time=918] What suggestions do you have for us?
[time=921] We'd like to ask you to write and if you want to, we'll mail your survey quickly so that we can have your input and decisions that we'll be making in the very near future.
[time=931] So please write to us today and ask for the Bible Hour Survey.
[time=935] Before you on the screen is the address, it's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=947] Pete, thank you for giving that address. You have a busy time coming up with a concert that we're co-hosting with some other ministries here in town.
[time=956] Eric, we have a kind of an exciting ministry in the community here.
[time=959] We're co-hosting a contest with Anker Room bookstore here in Fort Wayne, where there'll be 50 contestants who will be singing solos with judges from outside of the area on Saturday the 25th.
[time=972] And then there'll be a concert that evening with the group called One.
[time=976] If you recall, One is the backup group to Sandy Patti. They were here last summer in our church and were really enjoyed and I think there'll be a great inspiration along with about 7 of the contestants who are judged as being the best will sing in that evening concert along with One.
[time=996] Well, that's a night to look forward to. I remember the One concert last year and I remember also a lady gave her heart to Christ that night.
[time=1004] Since that night, her husband and family have all come to Christ and they're an active part of worshiping and serving the Lord here.
[time=1011] It was a dynamic night of ministry and we hope that you'll come again. That's coming up at the end of this month.
[time=1016] Yes, Rick. Again, that's Saturday, February 25th at 730 at the worship center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1024] Also today, we want to encourage you to write so that we can send you an excellent little book with the simple title, Money.
[time=1032] We've chosen that book and that title because that's the subject of our Bible study here today.
[time=1038] What the Bible says about money. I don't know of any issue of life more relevant than money.
[time=1045] As a pastor, one of my privileges and responsibilities is to spend a significant amount of time counseling people.
[time=1053] And regardless of what problem they come through the door bearing, before the discussion is over, they're also talking about money problems.
[time=1062] And it's regardless of the amount of money they have, it's still a problem. How to earn it? How to save it? How to spend it?
[time=1070] What do I do? What's fair and right in giving it?
[time=1073] And many times there's an inner tension and perhaps a family tension over money.
[time=1077] This booklet will go a long way to help you understanding God's plan for your financial management of life.
[time=1084] So we encourage you to write for the book today.
[time=1087] We've provided this booklet for you absolutely free, and we'd like to have you receive it by writing to the Bible Hour.
[time=1093] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1100] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1109] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here.
[time=1112] As we go back to our morning worship service, you'll hear a song from a young man by the name of Tim Teder.
[time=1118] Tim is not only a gifted singer, but he is the youth pastor of our church.
[time=1122] He leads a dynamic ministry assisted by his wife Connie.
[time=1126] They love the Lord, and they love young people.
[time=1129] If you're a high school student, a junior hire, or perhaps the parent or the grandparent of one, we want to encourage you to come to Black Hawk, be involved under the leadership of Tim's dynamic youth ministry.
[time=1141] I hope you'll enjoy his singing.
[time=1160] [MUSIC - 153 seconds]
[time=1321] - Thank you, Jim.
[time=1327] I would like to invite you to bow that we could pray together.
[time=1331] God, as we talk with you this morning, that melody and those words are so penetrating.
[time=1339] Sincerely yours.
[time=1341] Father, I know that I've given my heart to you, but I know that day by day and hour by hour I contemplate and occasionally do take it back.
[time=1352] I'm reminded in Tim's song today that I need your help to even live for you.
[time=1359] And so we've come as a body of people to say that we are sincerely yours.
[time=1365] We confess that we have worshiped other gods.
[time=1369] We've followed other voices than yours this week.
[time=1373] We ask your forgiveness for the times that we have listened to the voice of pleasure, that we have heeded the call of prestige, that we've worshiped God of money.
[time=1386] God, we've come into this sanctuary to be set apart and to set these moments apart to you.
[time=1394] But yet our minds would be quick to flee to other concerns, the preoccupations, as you, Lord, said the cares of this world.
[time=1405] And so we ask you to dominate these moments, to capture not only our presence but our minds and help us to singularly focus on you.
[time=1416] We pray that we would hear your voice today giving a word of direction to young people who are dabbling with other gods.
[time=1424] We pray for those who are too quick to fall into temptation.
[time=1431] We pray for others who've gone out deliberately to seek it.
[time=1435] We pray for our young people that you'll give them a hunger to please you in a purity in life, character in a world that has gone wild after play.
[time=1444] Thank you for Tim and Connie's leadership and the work of the volunteers who team up with them.
[time=1454] We pray today for those of us in the middle of life who time and press and stress, collect upon us and achieving all that we can has become the God of our life.
[time=1469] We pray that we would hear your voice.
[time=1474] We pray for those in the senior years of life who look back on life and now feel that life owes them that they would not grow weary and well-doing but seek to please you on the last leg of their late relay.
[time=1491] Father today, we pray for Herb Colli.
[time=1494] As he walks through the valley of the shadow of death that you'd walk with him, we pray for June that you might know of the peace of God that does surpass understanding.
[time=1503] We pray for Joe Young that you'll give him the strength to face this day and the next.
[time=1508] We pray for little Shelly, both body and soul for recovery.
[time=1513] For Jim and Blanche and Jim and Audrey and the rest of their family, Larry, Ron, you would give comfort to their lives.
[time=1523] Now as we study your word, we ask you to speak in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1531] It is without a doubt the least popular
[time=1537] and the most popular subject of all times, that of money.
[time=1543] It is so popular that when you go to check out of the grocery store, there are magazines titled Money, Business Week, Fortune, Forbes, Success, and on and on the list go of magazines that sole purpose is to tell us how to get and to keep and to make money grow.
[time=1565] And even the more generalized magazines often have as their cover and lead story how you can be successful, how you can make more money, how you can invest your money better.
[time=1576] It is the most popular subject.
[time=1580] And yet at the same time it is absolutely the least popular subject.
[time=1586] Our nation is in an uproar over a 50% raise to federal employees.
[time=1594] We find that somehow questionable.
[time=1599] And we think of money and suddenly it becomes a tainted, dirty subject.
[time=1606] Not one to be a favorite and to be embraced but one to be shunned.
[time=1610] And then if you can mix either money and politics or money and religion together, well now you really have a witch's brew.
[time=1619] It's both our favorite and our least favorite subject of all time.
[time=1626] For the Lord Jesus Christ it was one that he must have considered a favorite because it's one of the topics that he most often addressed.
[time=1635] Jesus gave in the four gospels 38 different parables.
[time=1640] 17 of them have as their principal subject money are related topic.
[time=1649] Some one has taken the time to count words and verses and chapters and then the three books of the synoptics Matthew, Mark and Luke 1/6 of all that Jesus said talks about money.
[time=1662] It was for him a subject to be embraced not avoided.
[time=1667] We've been studying what does the Bible say about life's issues?
[time=1670] We've talked about things like depression and homosexuality.
[time=1673] We've addressed the issue of what does God's word have to say about abortion.
[time=1678] What does the Bible have to say about the last temptation of Christ?
[time=1681] Life's issues.
[time=1683] Today we ask the question what does the Bible say about money?
[time=1687] If you have a copy of the scriptures I invite you to open yours as I have opened mine the first Timothy chapter 6.
[time=1695] If you can't find first Timothy don't hesitate to use the table of contents at the front of your Bible.
[time=1702] It's a little over halfway through the New Testament.
[time=1705] After first and second Thessalonians comes first Timothy.
[time=1709] Chapter 6 verse 17 through 19.
[time=1714] It reads like this.
[time=1716] Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth which is so uncertain
[time=1726] but to put their hope in God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
[time=1735] They command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds,
[time=1742] and to be generous and willing to share.
[time=1747] In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age so that they may take hold of
[time=1757] the life that is truly life.
[time=1762] First Timothy 6 17 18 and 19.
[time=1766] Out of this passage I've discovered three very simple comments about what the Bible has to say about money.
[time=1774] First money is a rival to God.
[time=1778] Secondly it's a resource from God and then finally it's a responsibility before God.
[time=1786] Let's look at them one at a time.
[time=1789] First of all I believe this passage and others like it teach us that money is not a neutral subject.
[time=1796] It's not just a commodity of exchange.
[time=1799] It's not that which we fold in our bill fold or jingle in our pocket or exchange when we leave the country.
[time=1805] It is actually a source of spiritual power that it is actually one of the gods of this world and it's a rival to God himself.
[time=1817] That may sound a little strong but allow me to back it up with Scripture.
[time=1821] It says command those who are rich not to put their hope are
[time=1827] their trust in money but instead to put their hope, their trust in God.
[time=1833] The two are pitted as rivals.
[time=1836] Jesus put it even stronger when he said no man can serve two masters.
[time=1841] He will either love the one and hate the other or cling to the one who spies the other.
[time=1847] You cannot serve God and money.
[time=1851] It's actually a rival to God himself.
[time=1855] Now we can make money a God but we can make any number of things a God in our life.
[time=1860] We can make prestige a God in our life.
[time=1863] We can make climbing the proverbial ladder getting one wrong higher the very pursuit of our life so that everything we do is around climbing that ladder.
[time=1874] My ethics, the use of my time, the use of my talent, the use of my money, everything I do revolves around that ladder.
[time=1883] That became the God of that individual's life.
[time=1887] We can make our family our God.
[time=1891] And this is a place where we want to say that family is a priority.
[time=1895] But you know we can become so cloister that this is me and this is mine and this is us and we make every decision exclusively on what's best for me and my family.
[time=1907] And it can become the very God of our life.
[time=1910] In my life as a high school student I made a God out of swimming.
[time=1914] Oh it wasn't the pool or the water that I worshiped but it was the recognition that came along with that.
[time=1920] I loved to sit in a high school and listen on Monday morning when they would make the announcements in the school and just think maybe today they'll mention my name.
[time=1930] I can remember daydreaming.
[time=1932] That's all you can do when you swim laps.
[time=1934] You just daydream on back and maybe somebody will know that I'm somebody in this big school.
[time=1939] Maybe although I'm somebody if I could just win that big meat.
[time=1943] My whole life revolved around with the swimming demand.
[time=1947] It was the God of my life.
[time=1949] The most likely false God for us to worship today.
[time=1953] Minister and lay personal like is the false God of money.
[time=1961] Jesus picked that out as the rival God when he said you cannot serve two masters.
[time=1967] You cannot serve God and money at the same time.
[time=1971] His logic was profound.
[time=1973] He said that first of all they're exclusive in their obligation.
[time=1976] No man can serve two masters.
[time=1979] The words there ring of slavery a hideous institution but one that Jesus would use to illustrate are allegiance to God.
[time=1988] When he used the word serve it was the word be a slave to.
[time=1993] And when he said master is referring to that individual who owned a slave.
[time=1999] It was nothing like our mentality today of an eight to five work day.
[time=2004] Two weeks vacation after one year four weeks after four years.
[time=2008] Ten paid holidays, ten days of sick leave, ten days of family onus leave, ten days of personal leave.
[time=2014] And if you care to show up we'd really appreciate that.
[time=2019] When you were a slave you were owned.
[time=2024] A slave master owned you as a living tool.
[time=2029] He could beat you, he could sell you, he could exchange you, he could kill you and it wasn't against the law.
[time=2035] You were a thing, you were owned by the master.
[time=2039] And you never had a moment that was your time.
[time=2042] You could not say well at the end of the day at least I'll have a little time for myself.
[time=2046] Not unless your master said you can have a little time for yourself.
[time=2050] And it was impossible for a man to be a servant, a slave to two masters.
[time=2055] You could not be a slave to master over here and a slave to this master because those were exclusive obligations.
[time=2066] It would be like saying I'm going to give myself to play on two teams.
[time=2073] The San Francisco 49ers and the Cincinnati Bengals, you can't do that.
[time=2078] They're exclusive obligations.
[time=2081] Jesus went on to explain they're not only exclusive obligations but there's exclusive allegiance.
[time=2089] You will love one and your love for that one will make you hate the one
[time=2095] that's the opposite.
[time=2097] Or you will embrace this one and you'll despise that one because it is the absolute opposite.
[time=2104] Our loyalty to one of those two forces us to be exclusive in our allegiance
[time=2110] and to deny and denounce the other.
[time=2113] And then Jesus said we are exclusive in our ownership.
[time=2117] You cannot serve God and money.
[time=2123] One of those two has to own your life.
[time=2127] Either the Lord Jesus Christ owns your life or your life is owned by some other
[time=2134] God and Jesus was saying most likely it is the God of money.
[time=2140] John MacArthur described it this way, his words are well penned.
[time=2145] The orders of these two masters are diametrically opposed.
[time=2149] The one commands you to walk by faith.
[time=2151] The other says walk by sight.
[time=2154] The one says to us be humble.
[time=2157] The other says be proud.
[time=2160] The one says to us live for eternity.
[time=2164] The other says live for today.
[time=2169] One says to us live by setting your affection on things that are above.
[time=2175] The other says set your affections on the things that are below.
[time=2180] The two are diametrically opposed.
[time=2183] They are exclusive and money is a rival to God.
[time=2188] John Calvin, the great reformer, wrote these words.
[time=2192] "Where riches hold dominion in the heart, God has lost his authority."
[time=2201] You see, if money is not really a rival God then many of Jesus' words make no sense.
[time=2208] Why would Jesus say do the rich young ruler go so everything you have, give it to the poor,
[time=2214] and then come and follow me?
[time=2217] The only way that makes sense is if we recognize that for the rich young ruler money was the rival God of his life.
[time=2229] Bob Dylan, who has been on and off spiritually, on moment wrote these words.
[time=2235] You've got to serve somebody.
[time=2237] Everybody's got to serve somebody.
[time=2239] It may be the devil, or it may be the Lord, but everybody's got to serve somebody.
[time=2246] The question is not if we are going to be a servant or not.
[time=2252] The question is whose servant will we be?
[time=2257] David Burnham tells this story of growing up in Akron, Ohio and walking downtown through the area where the department stores were in the 40s.
[time=2265] Men would do just about anything during a few pennies to support their family in those hard days of the early war years.
[time=2272] And one of the ways that men would make a few dollars was to use themselves as an advertisement.
[time=2277] They would wear a sandwich board.
[time=2279] It would be a board that they would hook together with a leather strap to a board on the back and they'd walk around.
[time=2285] And it might say, you know, eat wonder bread on this side and on the back of its shop at O'Neill's.
[time=2291] And this one man had a sandwich board and he would walk through Akron, Ohio and it said, "I am a fool for Jesus Christ."
[time=2298] Burnham said, he remembered walking by that and thinking himself, "That guy is a fool." David wasn't a believer that, "That guy is a fool." And as he walked past he read the backside which said, "Who's fool are you?"
[time=2315] You see, we're going to serve somebody.
[time=2317] Someone or something is going to be our master.
[time=2320] It's either going to be Jesus Christ or our rival God and if it is, it's probably in some form, money.
[time=2329] And so Paul, by inspiration of God, tells Timothy to warn those who are rich, not to put our trust, our hope in money, but in the living God.
[time=2344] The second thing that he teaches us here is a different principle.
[time=2349] Money, yes, it's a rival God, but it's also a resource from God himself.
[time=2356] He says, "Don't put your trust in money which is uncertain, but put it in God who gives us everything richly to be enjoyed."
[time=2366] God gives us money as a resource from him.
[time=2371] Allow me to develop that in three ways.
[time=2374] First of all, this tells us that God is the source of everything, including money.
[time=2380] In Psalm 24 verse 1 it says, "The earth, the whole globe, the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof."
[time=2388] That means not only the planet in general, but down to the specifics, everything belongs to God.
[time=2394] Even though on our coins it says, "e pluribus unum" which probably means you owe me.
[time=2400] That doesn't mean that means out of one many, but out of many one.
[time=2404] Anyway, we get our country and our presidents and we say, "Ah, this is our country's money and it's mine." We put it in our pocket, God says, "No, the gold is mine and the silver is mine."
[time=2415] Money is mine.
[time=2418] In Psalm 50 verses 8 through 12 is that famous passage where it says, "The Lord owns the cattle on a thousand hills."
[time=2426] In verse 12 it says, "He owns the hills too." God owns everything.
[time=2432] First Corinthians takes it so far as to say, "God owns you and God owns me."
[time=2442] He is the source. He is the absolute owner of everything.
[time=2447] We make the mistake and think that we own things.
[time=2452] That was driven home to Kathy and to me this past week as we had the privilege of visiting Washington, D.C.
[time=2458] My favorite thing was probably going through the White House.
[time=2461] As we went from room to room, they would say, "This desk was Abraham Lincoln's desk."
[time=2468] This China was Mrs. Wilson's China.
[time=2472] This is the Red Room. It's a beautiful room and it was beautiful.
[time=2476] It had this red satin paper and the high ceilings and they said, "This is Mrs. Reagan's favorite room."
[time=2484] But as they went through and they named those presidents FDR, this was his fireplace where he gave the fireside chat.
[time=2491] It dawned on me, but it's not FDR's fireplace anymore and it's not Nancy Reagan's Red Room.
[time=2496] It's not Mrs. Wilson's China and it's not Abraham Lincoln's desk.
[time=2500] That belonged to George and Barbara Bush for now.
[time=2506] None of those people really owned it, as Howard Hendricks said.
[time=2510] That's why you'll never see a hearse pulling a U-Haul.
[time=2513] We don't own anything, not a thing.
[time=2517] We got a grim reminder of that yesterday as I prepared our taxes.
[time=2522] I used to think for the first few months that we owned a house, that we owned a house.
[time=2529] We don't own a house. The bank owns the house, we own the keys to the front door.
[time=2534] That's all we own.
[time=2538] God owns everything.
[time=2542] That's what this passage is telling us, but it goes beyond that and says, "God not only is the source of everything,
[time=2548] but he's the supplier of everything. Not only is it his, but he's the one that gives it to us."
[time=2554] Out of all the biblical principles about money and stewardship, that is the hardest for me and most of us to swallow, that everything that I have, God supplied it.
[time=2564] Because we grew up in America, this country forged out a self-determination and self-reliance.
[time=2569] We were roughing it as Mark Twain would say, "We've pulled ourselves up by our own bootstraps."
[time=2575] The question is, "Who put the boots there?" God, he has supplied us everything the Bible says here.
[time=2584] He has supplied us absolutely everything.
[time=2589] I like to work with my hands.
[time=2592] And when we're having company over in a very humble, modest way, I make sure that our bedroom is really cleaned off well
[time=2599] and that there's a light on in the bedroom because it's right off the foyer.
[time=2602] And if people come in the foyer of our house, they'll see the bedroom and maybe they'll say, "That's a beautiful bed." Now, that's Kathy's cue to say, "Oh, well, Rick made that bed." And then I can just humbly shout that.
[time=2615] Now, these little hands made that bed. I made that bed.
[time=2620] God taught me in a very humbling way that I didn't make anything.
[time=2625] One year, trying to teach our kids a little bit of the value of a dollar, we started picking up aluminum cans, putting them in a grocery bag, and then someday we're going to cash them in for big money.
[time=2637] This carried on not only through the spring, but on our summer vacation.
[time=2641] In the hot June days of southern Florida, Kathy and the kids are out there collecting cans.
[time=2648] It became my lucky detail to go to have them cashed in.
[time=2654] First of all, I didn't know there was a difference between an aluminum can and a metal can, and I got to sort hundreds of those on the asphalt of Florida in 100 degree temperature.
[time=2664] As I sorted them, I shook out the sand and noticed these living things called roaches that also came out of the can and dawned on me that these had been in the back of our station wagon for 10 days.
[time=2676] By the time I sorted the cans, cashed them in, we had netted $5 in profit.
[time=2681] It had taken me three hours. It cost $3 for the roach killer to clean out the car.
[time=2687] That gave them $2. While going through that process, though,
[time=2693] I got out of my air-conditioned station wagon with my cans that I'd collected just for the fun of it.
[time=2701] I saw men who didn't have an air-conditioned car. They had a shopping cart.
[time=2707] They had an old worn-out hat. That was their air-conditioner. It was called shade.
[time=2712] These men had collected cans and pop bottles, and this is how they lived.
[time=2719] They were not lazy men. They had worked in the hot sun of Florida from sun up to sundown.
[time=2725] They would have gladly taken my job or any of our jobs. They weren't lazy, but that's what they had.
[time=2732] They didn't have a house full of tools and a nice workbench, and they couldn't say, "I made this!"
[time=2738] They could only pick up cans and say, "This is what I have." They discovered something. God supplied everything that I have.
[time=2748] That's why I was born in American. I wasn't born in impoverished country like Ethiopia.
[time=2754] I was born into a family that means the clone men to educate me. This man was not.
[time=2760] Then Deuteronomy chapter 8 came into mind. Don't say to yourself, "My power."
[time=2769] The strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me, but remember, it is the Lord.
[time=2775] Your God is He who gives you the ability to gain all that you have.
[time=2782] No God could today treat me like He did in Nebuchadnezzar and reduce me to a babbling fool.
[time=2789] Then what would these hands make? Then what words would this tongue utter forth?
[time=2794] Is God that has supplied everything? Everything.
[time=2800] And then thirdly, recognizing not only He is the source and He is the plier,
[time=2806] but He has also given it to be enjoyed.
[time=2810] Too often we plague ourselves with guilt, false guilt, because we have something.
[time=2817] Every time we purchase something new, we say, "I'm not sure that it's the right thing to do."
[time=2823] We go through false guilt because we're enjoying something.
[time=2827] But God says, "I've given you these resources to enjoy."
[time=2833] But you know you'll discover something. Not only can you enjoy things.
[time=2837] However, you'll only enjoy them if you manage them properly.
[time=2843] If you either hoard or squander, you'll never be happy.
[time=2848] I find myself quoting often a psychiatrist by the name of Karl Meninger.
[time=2853] Meninger was talking to enormously wealthy, yet enormously troubled man.
[time=2859] And Meninger said to the man, "What are you going to do with all of your wealth?"
[time=2865] The man says, "The only thing I do with it is worry about it." The counselor suggested that he might consider giving it away, and the man responded, "I'm terrified of the thought." His man had much, but he didn't enjoy a thing because he hoarded it.
[time=2882] The Lord is the man who squanders it, or the woman who hoards or squanders enjoy it.
[time=2888] John Wesley gave this great insight.
[time=2891] He said, "Un all you can, save all you can, and give away all you can."
[time=2898] It sounds simple, but that's the best way we know to enjoy what we have.
[time=2904] Because you only have what you give up, and you can only keep what you're willing to lose
[time=2910] to the Lord Jesus Christ, even our very lives.
[time=2915] It was also John Wesley, who when he was greeted with the tragic news that while out preaching his house burned down, without preparation or hesitation, Wesley said, "Hmm, the Lord's house burned down, one less worry for me." God on his horse and rode away.
[time=2932] He learned how to enjoy what he had because he held it loosely.
[time=2937] There's a third major principle here.
[time=2940] Money is a rival to God.
[time=2943] It's a resource from God.
[time=2945] It's given to us, and finally it's a responsibility before God.
[time=2950] Look at verse 18, "Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds,
[time=2956] and to be generous and willing to share." Verse 19, "In this way they will lay up treasures for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of life that is truly life."
[time=2971] Everything about it is a responsibility before God.
[time=2974] He gives us first the responsibilities and then the rewards.
[time=2978] The first responsibility he gives us is to be rich in good deeds.
[time=2983] You know, it's totally possible for us to be very wealthy financially and very poor spiritually.
[time=2991] And many times, if we have a significant amount of financial resources, that becomes the sole giving of our life.
[time=2999] God said, "I'd really rather have you than to have your money.
[time=3004] I'd really rather have your heart as your checkbook.
[time=3007] I'd really rather have your time as your saving account.
[time=3011] I'd rather have you turn over the title of your life than the title of your securities.
[time=3017] It's you I want." One of my favorite pictures in our church is when I see those of you who I know are wealthy, serving.
[time=3025] I'd love to see a lady whose dress probably costs more than most of our incomes get down in that dress
[time=3032] and pick up those little babies in the nursery and let them slobber all over them.
[time=3037] And they could care less because they love the Lord and they love those babies.
[time=3041] I'd love to see a man who's obviously wealthy, you know it by his employment, mopping a floor in our church or helping to paint a wall when we moved into the building.
[time=3052] Because they've learned not only to give out of their back pocket, but out of their heart.
[time=3057] They've given their lives.
[time=3060] Bible says our first responsibility is to be rich in good deeds.
[time=3065] That we're living for Jesus Christ.
[time=3068] And then the second responsibility is to be generous in giving.
[time=3074] Verse 18, command them to be rich in good deeds and to be generous and willing to share.
[time=3081] Charles Ryrie is one of the finest systematic theologians of all times.
[time=3087] He said in his book, Balancing the Christian Life, words, prayers and service can all be feigned.
[time=3095] But what we do with our money is often a true sign of who we really are.
[time=3100] Often the ledger of our checkbook is the ledger of our life.
[time=3105] It speaks volumes of what our priorities are, what our interests are, what our loves are.
[time=3110] It's a ledger anomaly of accounting of dollars, but an accounting of a life.
[time=3116] Here the Bible says that we are to be generous and willing to share.
[time=3122] In case you misunderstand the passage, you may be saying yes, but Rick, it says, command those who are rich in verse 17.
[time=3132] I'm not really rich.
[time=3136] Oh, yes you are. I am enormously wealthy.
[time=3141] Oh, you may not be as rich as one other person you're thinking of.
[time=3144] And that person may not be as wealthy as some nationally known individual.
[time=3148] But how many of us made our income this week?
[time=3153] Our sole income by the pop bottles that we collected and the cans that we redeemed.
[time=3161] We are rich, enormously rich and wealthy.
[time=3167] And in 1 Corinthians chapter 16, it takes the emphasis off the rich and to a church that was relatively poor, the Corinthian church, he said let each one of you lay up in store as God has prospered him.
[time=3180] It's a responsibility of every believer to be accountable to God for what we do with our money and to be generous in sharing it.
[time=3189] One of my least favorite things to do until this past week was to pay my taxes.
[time=3196] First of all, I hated the detailed accounting that you have to do.
[time=3200] And then secondly, I looked at all that money and said, wow, it's gone.
[time=3205] I think it's somewhere in late April that the newspapers say today the average American started
[time=3211] working for himself every day so far this year they've been working for the government.
[time=3216] And taxes grade at most of us.
[time=3219] But let me tell you a different perspective.
[time=3222] This past week, Kathy and I had the privilege of going to Washington, D.C.
[time=3227] When we were there, I was overtaken by the majesty of it all, the White House,
[time=3236] Washington and Lincoln Memorial, the new Vietnam War Memorial, and perhaps as much as anything the Jefferson Memorial.
[time=3244] I remember growing there as a little boy, I think I was about 11.
[time=3247] I remember walking up to the Supreme Court and those steps seemed to go up forever.
[time=3252] It was like a mountain, it was so big to a little 11 year old.
[time=3256] Can I tell you, 25 years later, it's still a mountain.
[time=3260] They are majestic and beautiful memorials.
[time=3264] And as I climb those steps, you could just feel under your feet the solid marble and the granite
[time=3270] and the quality of those majestic buildings.
[time=3274] And I don't say this just to be appropriate.
[time=3278] I was overwhelmed with our country.
[time=3281] With our heritage and the wisdom of godly men and women to found it, and the wisdom of men and women to say it's worth investing in memorials that only represent intangibles.
[time=3293] To a society that only knows that a dollar can buy this much pleasure or this much product, it was good to say that a dollar can be used to monument liberty.
[time=3303] How do you buy that?
[time=3305] What shelf do you pull it off of?
[time=3307] It's an intangible and we are a generation that's lost at all.
[time=3312] But there are things worth knowing and things worth remembering and things worth memorials.
[time=3318] And suddenly I was thankful to pay taxes.
[time=3322] And my own heart said, if every one of my tax dollars went for this one thing, I'll pay it again gladly.
[time=3329] And then I thought of that majestic five-sided building, the Pentagon, and it represented the security of this country that I can stand here today and I can name the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=3341] We've got missionaries in this auditorium that went behind the iron curtain.
[time=3344] They couldn't name that name.
[time=3346] I'm thankful today that out of my taxes I can provide for the security of a nation.
[time=3352] I'm thankful today that when I took that trip and I drove from Fort Wayne to Washington, D.C.
[time=3357] There were wide, spacious roads and I can go 65.
[time=3362] Occasionally it was only 55 and I forgot but we just, we rode down those roads and it took pioneers.
[time=3370] On the original national highway, U.S. 40, it would take them a month to get from Washington, D.C.
[time=3377] The Fort Wayne, Indiana, we made it in ten hours.
[time=3382] I'm so thankful that out of my taxes I could pay that.
[time=3385] Then it dawned on me not only has God given us much as a country, but look at this church.
[time=3391] God has blessed us.
[time=3392] We have a youth ministry and Tim and Connie could come with their talents and their energy and their love and they can lead a youth ministry.
[time=3399] George Lammon can reach out to senior adults who don't even have a car with buses and vans volunteers can pick them up by the hundreds every Friday.
[time=3408] We have an auditorium that is spacious and comfortable.
[time=3411] By God's grace it would be filled but we can go to two services.
[time=3415] We have a school that gives opportunity for nearly 400 children to learn academic excellence
[time=3421] but on a foundation of God's Word.
[time=3424] We have a ministry of counseling that can take those troubled lives that need more than a simple word of encouragement
[time=3430] and give them guidance through life's jungle with insight that's found in the Word of God but it has all the reasoning of the sciences meshed together and integrated.
[time=3440] At this very moment my children will be in a Sunday school class that will be filled with Kindergarteners for Adam
[time=3446] and second graders for Rebecca and third graders for Rachel and they'll never come home and say like so many have to say at their church, "Mommy I don't have a friend there.
[time=3455] There's nobody my age. All the other kids are older or younger." I'd say, "Oh God what a privilege it is to give to a ministry." We give because it's our responsibility before God but it's not only a responsibility because he has given the money to us
[time=3471] but then we have the privilege of giving it back to him in the name of ministry that feeds our very lives.
[time=3477] What a privilege it is to give today.
[time=3480] And then he speaks of the reward in verse 19.
[time=3484] That as we give out of responsibility our heart may be sincere, it may be duplicious
[time=3490] but as we give we're laying up an investment, a reward that will count for eternity.
[time=3515] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and orchestra and soloist Marilyn Wong and Tim Teder.
[time=3523] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3526] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior just before we close I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3534] Will you bow your heads with me?
[time=3536] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this day and I thank you for the reminder that I need Jesus Christ as my personal Savior.
[time=3545] I know that I've sinned against you and I ask you to come into my heart and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3553] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3557] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3561] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3569] To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Money"
[time=3575] please write to the Bible hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=3583] To receive a cassette copy of today's message write and request tape number 1381
[time=3592] or use the sermon title "What the Bible Says About Money" and please enclose a gift of $3 to help to pray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3601] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club,
[time=3611] a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry.
[time=3615] To learn how you can become a member of the Founders Club please write directly into the Bible hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=3627] Now speaking from Pastor Rick Hawks this is Bill VR inviting you to join us each week at this time for the Bible hour.
