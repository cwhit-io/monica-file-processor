[time=0] Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[time=2] (eerie music)
[time=60] (crowd murmuring) - Corey Tenboom had just finished a Bible study.
[time=84] She'd shared with a group of people how God was forgiving.
[time=89] As the Bible study concluded, a dark figure approached her.
[time=94] The gentleman looked vaguely familiar to her.
[time=97] He spoke, "Does God's forgiveness include me?" "Yes," said Corey Tenboom.
[time=105] "God's forgiveness includes you.
[time=107] Would you forgive me?" Was at that moment that Corey Tenboom remembered the face.
[time=115] It was the face of a guard at the German concentration camp that had held her hostage.
[time=120] The concentration camp that had held her sister hostage.
[time=124] And in that camp, her sister Betsy died.
[time=127] The words echoed in her mind, "Would you forgive me?" Corey Tenboom said it was the hardest and the greatest thing she ever did.
[time=140] When she took that man's hands and said, "I forgive you." (dramatic music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Haas.
[time=162] Thank you for joining us.
[time=163] Rick's message today is entitled, "What the Bible Says About Forgiveness." Corey Tenboom's story is a remarkable one.
[time=171] Her faith in Christ not only kept her life in a Nazi concentration camp, but also kept her life from the concentration camp of bitterness.
[time=179] Forgiveness is life's greatest responsibility.
[time=182] For the Lord teaches us that He forgives us as we forgive others.
[time=186] Today we will study what the Bible says about forgiveness.
[time=191] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=195] Rick's text is taken from the book of Matthew chapter six verses 14 and 15.
[time=201] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=206] Other special music includes a selection from the Handbell Choir and the solo from Lisa Reniker.
[time=214] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=225] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=228] Now, here's Rick.
[time=232] - So good to look out and to see your faces.
[time=235] I detect that that sunshine that's out there that we haven't seen for 12 days is contagious and it's on your countenance.
[time=243] It's a delight to see you who are regular members here at Black Hawk.
[time=247] We have the Lesperances are home.
[time=248] They're about to leave for France in the next few months.
[time=252] They're back from Chicago.
[time=253] Friends have returned after caring for their loved ones, but we've gathered from all walks of life to declare today that we want to make His praise glorious.
[time=263] We're glad that you've come.
[time=264] We're thankful God would give us opportunity of outreach through television to come into homes and hospital rooms through the Bible Hour.
[time=271] And we welcome those friends.
[time=273] And today our choir leads us with a great majestic hem of praise.
[time=278] Make His praise glorious.

[time=541] (upbeat music) (applause)
[time=551] What a privilege again, as I've said many Sundays, to make the name of the Lord and his praises known. They are glorious indeed.
[time=559] Let us continue our worship singing together, hymn number 505.
[time=564] Rather old gospel hymn of the church, love lifted me.
[time=569] Let's sing it together with great enthusiasm as testimony of the change that God indeed made in our lives.
[time=576] (upbeat music)
[time=597] (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=608] (upbeat music)
[time=737] Thank you for that good testimony and song, we appreciate that. Continue with music now as the hand bells play for us. You listen as they play and then keep in mind. The title of the song is "They will know we are Christians by our love, by our love."
[time=753] (upbeat music)
[time=893] It is such a privilege for us to welcome you again to the Bible hour. We trust that God's already encouraged your heart by that rousing song of our choir and the melody of the bells. Good morning Pete. How are you? Good morning. We're suffering from a cold, but otherwise we're making it fine. I thought maybe your voice was just finally changing in life. Well, there's that point in time perhaps in heaven when I'll be a bass. That's my request. Well, you're only 19. I thought your voice was changing.
[time=920] Joining Pete and myself today is a good friend of ours, Lloyd Hicks. Lloyd works with us here at Blackhawk, but he's been a part of our church and a friend for many years. Lloyd, thanks for joining us here today on the Bible Hour.
[time=932] Fine to be here, Rick. Lloyd works with us as a counselor and the director of the Live Counseling Center. Lloyd, when I first met you, you were in business and I might add a very successful business. How did you happen to get into counseling?
[time=946] The person who began the Live Counseling Center, Dr. Ken Nichols, encouraged me very much to go back to school and prepare for future ministry in counseling.
[time=956] When you say back to school, what type of work did you have to take? What did you go through?
[time=962] At age 50, I graduated with a master's in counseling. And with over 60 hours of graduate level work, I have completed all the requirements also for a master's degree in clinical psychology.
[time=975] So you have work of 60 graduate hours. That had to be a formidable challenge at any age.
[time=981] Well, it just shows you that an old dog can learn new tricks.
[time=985] I'm not going to call you an old dog. Well, the Counseling Center is a great ministry, and many times we have people calling us saying, "I need professional help."
[time=995] Lloyd, what type of professional counseling can people get through the Live Counseling Center?
[time=999] We provide individual marriage and family counseling and deal with such issues as assertiveness, depression, anxiety, anger, loss, items such as that, helping people through their struggle.
[time=1014] I might want to add for just a moment that we are encouraging those of you who are suffering from some of the things that Lloyd has just mentioned that the Live Counseling Center is available not only to the people of Blackhawk, but the community.
[time=1027] It's a ministry that we provide beyond regular pastoral care, and I should note that it's on a per-fee basis.
[time=1034] We've worked hard at keeping our fees down and competitive or below what you might find at other places because this is a ministry.
[time=1042] Lloyd, I know that you're very successful in your work. I won't get into that.
[time=1046] But at age 50, when all of your life's work is well in order, why do you go to all the effort of putting yourself available to people for counseling?
[time=1056] That's a good question, and I'm glad to answer it.
[time=1060] The needs of people are very high nowadays, and on every hand, there are those reaching out for help.
[time=1066] And we try to provide counseling for the total person, the emotional as well as the spiritual needs.
[time=1072] And if we can help them through their tough times, see them get their life straightened out spiritually, even see them coming to church and involved in Bible study,
[time=1083] and then have them comment that their friends' greatest need is Jesus Christ in their lives.
[time=1088] That's the reward you get from helping people.
[time=1091] Well, Lloyd, I'm so thankful that God has equipped you and placed you here to do that.
[time=1095] As I receive letters from many of you, you speak of such deep hurts, and I'm encouraged to know that people with deep hurts can find help.
[time=1103] If you're interested in the Alive Counseling Center, we want to encourage you to call the Church Office Monday through Friday.
[time=1111] Our phone number is 4937400.
[time=1115] Pete, we have an exciting concert coming up in just a few days away.
[time=1119] Eric, we have a group called One here. Actually, it's three young men.
[time=1123] Currently, they're on tour with Sandy Patti in her 1988 and '89 world tour, and occasionally they have a couple breaks in their schedule where they can come,
[time=1134] and they're going to be here February 25th.
[time=1136] That's a Saturday evening, 730 at our worship center.
[time=1140] Along with them singing, there will be a contest throughout the day, and a number of the contest winners will be performing in that evening concert with one.
[time=1149] Well, that's an exciting night.
[time=1151] We are going to be in a family reunion in Akron, Ohio that day, and now I know we're coming back early.
[time=1157] That'll be a great night.
[time=1159] Before we return to our worship service, I want to encourage you to write in today for an excellent, helpful booklet by Pastor Jim Henry of the First Baptist Church of Orlando, Florida.
[time=1170] It has the clear, simple one-word title of "Bitterness." Many of you will profit much through this helpful booklet.
[time=1179] In our study today on the Bible Hour, we'll look at what God has said about forgiveness.
[time=1184] The opposite of forgiveness is bitterness.
[time=1187] It's an event in our life that we harbor and hold, and we turn our insides out with the resentment, the anger, and the malice, and actually it hurts no one except for ourselves.
[time=1202] Most of us struggle with bitterness to some degree, some of us to a very significant degree, and we want to help you, and we'll give you this book simply for the asking.
[time=1212] We encourage you to write today for this booklet right to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1223] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1232] Thank you, Lloyd and Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1262] [AMEN] The one who is eternally the same.
[time=1270] There is no other name.
[time=1279] The first and last beginning and the end.
[time=1284] He washed the king who made the common man his friend.
[time=1290] There is no other name.
[time=1297] Let every tongue proclaim and sing the name of Jesus.
[time=1309] Magnify and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1315] No other name but Jesus.
[time=1322] There is power in the precious name of Jesus.
[time=1329] Jesus, the Messiah, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=1339] Jesus.
[time=1346] He created all that is with his own hands, and yet the smallest in need he understands.
[time=1364] There is no other name.
[time=1373] The one who said, "I am the great I am."
[time=1379] And then he gave himself the sacrifice for man.
[time=1384] There is no other name.
[time=1391] Let every tongue proclaim and sing the name of Jesus.
[time=1405] Magnify and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1411] No other name but Jesus.
[time=1418] There is power in the precious name of Jesus.
[time=1425] Jesus.
[time=1428] For ever he shall reign as King.
[time=1436] Lord of all and every living thing.
[time=1442] From dawn we will worship him and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1451] Magnify and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1466] Let every tongue proclaim and sing the name of Jesus.
[time=1473] No other name but Jesus.
[time=1481] There is power in the precious name of Jesus.
[time=1488] Jesus.
[time=1491] For ever he shall reign as King of Kings.
[time=1498] Lord of all and every living thing.
[time=1505] From dawn we will worship him and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1513] Jesus.
[time=1519] Magnify and praise the name of Jesus.
[time=1534] ♪
[time=1550] Thank you, Lisa.
[time=1551] We have come today to magnify the name of Jesus.
[time=1555] Not all of us have voices that we can sing it so beautifully.
[time=1559] But we all have opportunity to praise him and declare that we love him.
[time=1563] One of the simplest ways to do that is to simply give out a Bible, to share God's word.
[time=1569] Paul was locked and bound in a Roman prison cell but he would write the Timothy and say that he was bound but the word of God was not bound.
[time=1578] We today have the privilege of declaring and song and teaching the word of God.
[time=1583] But what could you do tomorrow?
[time=1585] Could you simply pass out a copy of the Bible?
[time=1587] What power that could have.
[time=1589] There's a group of businessmen who make it their ministry to distribute God's word.
[time=1594] They are called Gideon's and we've asked Ron Stoller who is a businessman in our community, a member of our church and a Gideon to share a word of testimony about that ministry today.
[time=1608] Thank you Rick.
[time=1611] Fred Brown was born into a family which had no money at all.
[time=1615] He was through his younger years totally devoid of any of the pleasures that we constantly feel we can afford.
[time=1624] But Fred remembers one thing more than anything else in his youth and that is at a very young age, the state police car pulling up to the front of the home taking his daddy away.
[time=1636] They were so poor in fact that after he was taken from the city of Circleville, Ohio to Columbus at the state penitentiary they couldn't even afford the gasoline to drive down to Columbus to visit his daddy.
[time=1651] And he said months went by and I was so longing to talk to my daddy.
[time=1657] Finally they saved up enough money that they could drive down to the state penitentiary.
[time=1663] And he said I vividly recall walking through those iron gates clanging one at a time behind us.
[time=1669] And then the guards coming up to my mother and literally every square inch of her body was inspected.
[time=1676] Her purse was opened, emptied and every square inch of it was checked.
[time=1683] Every inch of her clothing was checked possibly to be smuggling in some contraband.
[time=1690] They said I was petrified and we finally arrived inside the jail and my daddy was let out to set on one side of the table and we were on the other and he started sharing with us.
[time=1703] I wanted to tell him everything that had happened in those intervening months since he had been taken away.
[time=1708] But he said the thing uppermost in his mind seemed to be to give my mother something.
[time=1713] And he took out of his clothing a book somewhat like the one I had with me but in a black color in those days and he slid it across that table to his wife and said these words.
[time=1726] Please take this book home.
[time=1729] I want you to read to the children from it and I want you to find what I've found in that book that is going to help me through these next ten years.
[time=1740] But he said please read it often and read it to the children to see if you can find what I found.
[time=1748] He said first of all I was petrified the very fact that here we were stealing something from the place that they put people who steal.
[time=1757] But he said in spite of that my mother put it inside of her sweater and as we left I thought sure she was going to be inspected again and we would be caught red handed.
[time=1767] But I said we finally got out into the car and she took out of her sweater that book and he said I noticed on the front cover it said placed by the Gideon's do not remove.
[time=1780] Said I thought that was a terrible sin to be stealing that.
[time=1784] But he said my mother did as she promised she daily as they would sit around the wood stove at night before retiring to bed.
[time=1792] She would read from God's word to those children around that wood stove.
[time=1797] And he said I don't suppose it's any surprise to you as Gideon's that we found what my father had found.
[time=1806] And we each in our family one at a time came to know Jesus Christ personally as our Savior as a direct result.
[time=1814] Now Fred Brown came to one of our international conventions to relate this testimony from the church there in Ohio where he is currently pastoring.
[time=1824] And he also shared with us that the entire family is fully engaged in the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ as a result.
[time=1832] Now I'm here to report to you that there's power in God's word.
[time=1836] And it's with that promise in mind do we share from God's word and place them around the areas that were best known in the traffic lanes of our world.
[time=1846] Currently the Gideon's who are nothing more than Christian business and professional men, men of the church taking the message to the church to those not normally in church.
[time=1856] And there's one stark revelation that came to me recently, if I may have sunk through my thick head, that most of these people that come to know Jesus Christ as a direct result of the Gideon ministry had no desire to seek God.
[time=1871] Think about that for a little bit, there's tremendous power in God's word that can accomplish that in spite of no person intervening.
[time=1878] There were currently over 130 countries passing the word of God, local Christian business men who are able to pass the testaments and get it in bibles out with no cultural shock.
[time=1889] But all they need is one thing that is for us to supply them in most of these countries they cannot afford to purchase the word of God.
[time=1897] I'm here basically for four reasons to ask you to pray for the ministry of the Gideon's.
[time=1901] Pray for us as Gideon's that we're able to be up and about what the Lord would have us do, secondly to pray for these scriptures as they're placed.
[time=1909] And then secondly to ask the men of the congregation that would qualify both spiritually and vocationally to pray about becoming a Gideon.
[time=1916] We need more Gideon's.
[time=1917] Third, to ask you to remember the plan that we call the living memorial Bible plan by which you may place in honor of a living loved one or in memory of the deceased loved one, copies of God's word.
[time=1928] And then fourth, but certainly not least, to ask you to give financially.
[time=1931] You're not giving to me, you're not supporting this organization, you're buying and placing scriptures.
[time=1936] Four dollar and fifteen cents currently on our hotel bibles and a dollar and fifteen cents currently on our youth testaments and all those versions.
[time=1946] I'd like to say this, 100% of every penny you give goes to purchase and place those scriptures, not one penny goes to overhead.
[time=1953] Now in closing, I'd like to give you another testimony.
[time=1956] I was privileged to speak in a church in the Phoenix, Arizona area a few years ago, and this particular church was a little bit unusual in the sense that I sensed the Holy Spirit of God present in that church like I seldom do.
[time=1969] This young pastor was on fire for God.
[time=1972] He told this testimony after the second service.
[time=1975] He said I'd like to add one of my own.
[time=1977] He said there was a man in the Second World War that was given a testament when he was inducted, and then later he went to the chaplain.
[time=1984] We as Gideon's give the chaplains an extra supply, and he said I was asked for another one of those testaments, and the chaplain gave him one and he left.
[time=1991] Another 30 days went by, and he walked to the chaplain again, he said sir, I'd like to have another one of those books.
[time=1997] The chaplain said okay, so he gave it to him and he left.
[time=1999] Another 30 days, another testament, another 30 days, another testament.
[time=2003] This kept going on.
[time=2005] Finally the chaplain said son, I am curious, what in the world are you doing with those testaments?
[time=2010] The young man said well, the government gives us tobacco, but it doesn't give us the cigarette papers, and those pages make excellent cigarette papers.
[time=2018] Chaplain thought a second, he said I'll tell you why, I'll make you do you.
[time=2021] I'll give you another one if you promised me one thing.
[time=2024] Before you smoke it, will you read it?
[time=2026] The young man said that sounds fair, and he agreed, and he left.
[time=2030] Well I don't suppose it surprises you, but while that young man did as he was promised, before he lit those up, the Word of God transformed that young man's life.
[time=2039] And he's, by the way, very active in the cause of Christ now, but why did the pastor share that testimony?
[time=2045] The young man that that happened to was the later very dedicated young Sunday school teacher that led this pastor to know Jesus Christ personally.
[time=2054] Does it work?
[time=2055] There's tremendous power in God's Word.
[time=2057] I'd like to say it this way.
[time=2059] You can count the seeds in an apple, but you can't count the apples in a seed.
[time=2063] Thank you for letting me share with you.
[time=2070] Thank you Ron.
[time=2071] There is power in God's Word, and that's why we have an emphasis here to seek to memorize God's Word.
[time=2077] In a moment, I'll ask you to stand and recite the memory verse for the month of February.
[time=2081] If you're visiting with us, we'd invite you to find that inside your Bolton and read along as we recite from memory.
[time=2088] Would you stand please now?
[time=2095] Matthew 624, "No one can serve two masters.
[time=2101] Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[time=2110] You cannot serve both God and money." Matthew 624.
[time=2116] Thank you.
[time=2117] You may be seated.
[time=2120] Thank you Dale, and I want to thank each of you who've made it a priority of your life to memorize God's Word.
[time=2127] Ron, thank you for those testimonies.
[time=2129] God's sovereign hand works in the most obvious and yet the most mysterious of ways that he can take a piece of paper that someone intended to smoke and turn it into the words of eternal life.
[time=2143] God, we thank you today for your word that it has power that it can change lives today.
[time=2150] And we pray even as we meet that you today would meet with us.
[time=2154] We love you, and we've set these moments aside to worship you, to sing praises, to listen to music that honors your name, that provokes us to good works.
[time=2166] We've come today to study the scriptures that we believe are the key to life.
[time=2171] We pray that even this morning that those who've never given their heart to Christ that today, they might receive him.
[time=2178] We pray for those who today know him, that we might walk in obedience to him.
[time=2185] We would also come today to pray, one for another.
[time=2189] We would pray for Geralt Swanson as he recovers.
[time=2193] We ask your hand to be upon him, as his body has been racked by both heart attack and stroke, and the life that he has is uncertain.
[time=2201] God, we would pray that your hand would be upon him.
[time=2205] We would pray for Bob Benetta's father as he fights to recover from a heart attack.
[time=2211] We pray for Dan Lantman, George's son, as he battles with Crohn's disease.
[time=2216] We ask you to put your hand on him, not only him, but Bill, and Jeff, and others who fight the same affliction.
[time=2224] We pray today for those who are going through tough choices in life, that you'll give them wisdom, that they'll walk with integrity, that they'll seek to please you.
[time=2236] We would ask today that you would put a fire for obedience in each of our hearts, and particularly those who are battling with addiction to drugs, for a young lady in a hospital, for two men who may even be here today, for a whole generation that has grown to seek pleasure at any cost.
[time=2256] Oh God, we ask you to speak to their hearts a word of eternal perspective, and even as we study your word today, we pray that you would teach us in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=2271] The man's inhumanity to man was never more graphic and more violent than in the days of Nazi Germany.
[time=2280] The inhumanity was grotesquely on points. Inhumane and dehumanizing activities, scientific experimentation, humiliation and extermination were the order of the day.
[time=2296] Millions upon millions of Jewish people and Jewish sympathizers alike were put to death.
[time=2304] Many of them were not executed. They died a slow death of disease or malnutrition, or of some form of infectious disease that spread throughout their stall log.
[time=2318] One of those who died was the sister of Kory Tenboom. Her name was Betsy, and Betsy and Kory encouraged each other, and she said that when Betsy died, part of me died.
[time=2331] But through God's grace and His strength, Kory Tenboom lived through a German concentration camp.
[time=2338] Years later, she was conducting a Bible study, and she would open her Bible and share it, and as she would share her Bible study, she would speak about God's love.
[time=2347] And His forgiveness. After one of those Bible studies, she closed in prayer, and people milled in many left, and a dark figure approached her.
[time=2358] And he said, Sister Tim Bohm, "Would God forgive me?" The face was familiar. A name would not come, but it was too familiar.
[time=2371] And he said, "Would God forgive even me?" Then she recognized that face, and no longer was it a face in a dark, mysterious clothing, but now it was a face in uniform. It came out of her memory.
[time=2386] He was a guard at that stall log. He was one who was responsible for the death of many of the people she loved. He was one who was responsible for Betsy's death.
[time=2400] And she said, "Yes. God would forgive you." He said, "Sister Tim Bohm, I know that, because I have asked him, and he has forgiven me.
[time=2412] But Sister Tim Bohm, will you forgive me?" Kory Tenboom said, "Those were the hardest words that her tongue could ever speak."
[time=2423] But the moment she spoke him that he came words of elation and joined the light as she took those two hands, those hands that had tortured, those hands that had humiliated, those hands that had brought death, and she held them in her hands.
[time=2438] And she looked eye to eye, and she said, "I forgive you. I forgive you."
[time=2448] Rife's greatest responsibility is forgiveness.
[time=2454] If you have a Bible with you, I invite you to open it to Matthew 6. Those familiar words that we call the Lord's Prayer.
[time=2463] Matthew 6 and verse 9 begins the Lord's Prayer. Today we will only steal one phrase and one comment.
[time=2472] In chapter 6, verse 12, Jesus said, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors."
[time=2483] And of all the things that Jesus taught in the Lord's Prayer, He only makes one comment, one explanation.
[time=2490] It is on that phrase, "Forgive us our debts." It's found in verses 14 and 15.
[time=2498] "For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
[time=2505] But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
[time=2515] In this passage, in this explanation, Jesus teaches us three simple principles about forgiveness.
[time=2526] Principle number one, we all need to forgive.
[time=2535] And principle number three, God has inseparably linked the two.
[time=2542] As we look at the topic of forgiveness, our human instincts normally spring up like a scared lion.
[time=2550] We are perched and ready for action.
[time=2553] And instinctively we say, "Me, forgive, they're the one that did the wrong, let them come to me."
[time=2559] And when they say, "I'm sorry," then I will forgive.
[time=2566] That God links our forgiveness with His forgiveness.
[time=2574] And our forgiveness is to be just like His forgiveness.
[time=2580] And though our instincts say, "Don't forgive," God gives us clear reason why we should forgive.
[time=2587] So let me begin there with sharing four reasons why we should forgive.
[time=2592] The first reason is the spiritual reason, and that is this, in order for us to be forgiven by God,
[time=2599] we must be first willing to forgive those who have sinned against us.
[time=2604] That's the whole point of what's being taught us right here.
[time=2609] There's an old commercial that was on TV.
[time=2612] I can remember it as a young boy.
[time=2614] It was done in animation, cartoon-like figures.
[time=2618] And this man was a mean old rancher, and he would catch people rustling his cattle,
[time=2625] and he would say to his men, "Hang him, it'll teach him a lesson." And then the man dreamed that he died, and he stood before God.
[time=2634] And suddenly he was aware that he needed forgiveness.
[time=2638] And he heard God say, "Forgive him, it'll teach him a lesson."
[time=2644] God has inseparably linked our behavior with his.
[time=2649] And he has said, "If we want him to forgive us, we can't be like that old mean rancher."
[time=2655] We've got to say forgive them.
[time=2658] It'll teach us a lesson.
[time=2661] The greatest reason why we must forgive is spiritual, and that is every one of us is in need of forgiveness.
[time=2670] A group of angry men had caught a filthy sinner in their midst,
[time=2676] and they were going to deal harshly with this sinner.
[time=2679] Why, this woman was caught in adultery, and their law said she ought to be publicly executed by stoning.
[time=2685] And they had surrounded her, and with strong hands, they'd clenched tightly on rocks, and they had raised fists high, and they were ready to throw a stone.
[time=2694] When Jesus said, "Yes, let's execute her.
[time=2697] Let's put her to death. Let's rid our community of this." That's right.
[time=2702] And the one of you who doesn't need any forgiveness, the one of you who is without sin,
[time=2708] you be the first to cast the stone.
[time=2711] And fists sank below elbows, tight grisps release stones as feet moved away,
[time=2721] because each one of them realized, "I'm in need of forgiveness."
[time=2728] If you're a part of the human race, then you know that you need forgiveness.
[time=2732] If there's one thing that we're aware of, our own conscience condemns us, society has tried to tell us that they're not such things as sin, they're just problems of living, but we know our own heart, and we need forgiveness.
[time=2745] And if we want gods, we pray.
[time=2750] God, I only expect you to forgive me as I forgive others.
[time=2756] The greatest reason why we should forgive is spiritual.
[time=2759] The second reason why we should forgive is emotional.
[time=2764] Emotionally, when we forgive, it releases us from the bondage of bitterness.
[time=2771] When forgiveness is at stake, what has happened is some event has taken place.
[time=2777] That event could be an injury, that event could be a misunderstanding, an unexpected event that caught us by surprise and hurt us, or an unmet expectation.
[time=2791] But with that event, it forces us to an emotional decision that we will allow that event
[time=2797] to either make us better or bitter.
[time=2802] You see, God allows hard things to come into our life. He calls them trials.
[time=2807] And He said, "I've given you those trials so that as you're tested, that your faith might be mature, it might be stronger, and it'll make you better."
[time=2817] But if we fail the test or the trial, instead of becoming better, we become bitter.
[time=2822] And bitterness is anger turned inward, hostility from the soul released.
[time=2831] Bitterness is a strange commodity.
[time=2834] When we are bitter, it poisons our own soul, and it troubles us on the inside,
[time=2843] and it robs us of joy, it robs us of happiness, it robs us of any opportunity that we have
[time=2852] to move beyond the hurt.
[time=2856] Jim Henry and his fine pamphlet on bitterness closes with this illustration.
[time=2860] The Civil War was over, the South had been defeated, and Robert E. Lee was now old and retired.
[time=2868] He had visited an old family friend who lived in Kentucky.
[time=2872] Kentucky was torn apart by the war, as the North would move south, and the South would move north. Too much of the war took place in her soil.
[time=2883] The older lady of the house sat looking out her window, and she said, "See that burnt old tree?" That was a beautiful flowering magnolia tree till the Yankees came through here.
[time=2897] She expected sympathy from the former Southern General.
[time=2901] She expected he would say those dirty Yankees and give him harsh words one more time.
[time=2908] Instead, Robert E. Lee leaned over, and he looked out the window, and he saw the burnt tree and offered this advice. Cut it down and forget it.
[time=2919] Many of us have events in our life that we've planted them in our front yard so we can look at them every day.
[time=2926] We can remind ourselves of how much we were heard, what that person did to us, and you know what they said? It's like our VCR.
[time=2934] We've got it right there on tape, and we just play it so it stays fresh.
[time=2939] The burnt tree in our front yard. Good advice from an old general.
[time=2944] Cut it down. Forget it.
[time=2948] The third benefit of forgiveness is physical, because you see, as one person put it,
[time=2954] our body and our emotions and our spirit and our mind live so close together they catch each other's diseases.
[time=2962] In a book by the title, none of these diseases, Dr. S. I. McMillan,
[time=2968] has over 50 diseases, chronic conditions, and physical ailments
[time=2974] that can be caused by bitterness or the lack of forgiveness.
[time=2980] Now, as I give you some of this list, please don't say, "Oh, anybody who has one of these things is a bitter old goat." They may be, but it won't help if you tell them that.
[time=2991] Some of these things can be caused by totally different stimuli, but it may be caused by bitterness.
[time=2999] There are diseases such as ulcers, digestive problems,
[time=3005] inflammation of key organs of the body, high blood pressure, resulting in aneurysm, hemorrhage, stroke, and heart failure.
[time=3014] Migraine headaches, chronic headaches, reoccurring problems of the stomach
[time=3020] and its inability to digest food, colitis and problems of the lower digestive track.
[time=3027] All of those things can be caused by a lack of forgiveness.
[time=3034] That's why it said that bitterness does more damage to the vessel in which it is held
[time=3040] than to the vessel in which it is poured.
[time=3044] A fourth reason why we should forgive is the social reason, that is, it's contagious.
[time=3052] Bitterness is as contagious as the chickenpox.
[time=3059] In Hebrews, chapter 12, verse 15, it says, "See to it that no root of bitterness springs up in you, and by it many be defiled."
[time=3069] I met with a man this past week, and he told me how terrible his first wife was,
[time=3076] and how rotten his first boss was, and how terrible his second boss was, and his third boss was worth, and his fourth boss, believe it or not, was worse than that, and he wanted to know if I had helped him find a job.
[time=3091] Then he said, "But the person that I can't stand the most is my wife."
[time=3098] And then God broke his heart and he said, "The reason I can't stand her is she was a nice lady, and now that she's lived with me, she's just like me.
[time=3107] She is mean, and she is bitter, and I've taught her to be that."
[time=3114] Bitterness is contagious.
[time=3118] That's why forgiveness is so important, because spiritually it's required of us to forgive so that God can forgive us.
[time=3126] Emotionally we'll be bound up in our bitterness. Physically we'll have the symptoms,
[time=3133] and socially we'll pass it on to those closest and dearest to us.
[time=3138] Well the Bible in Colossians chapter 3 verse 13 puts a new twist on this.
[time=3144] It says that we are to forgive just as Christ forgave us.
[time=3149] Allow me to share with you in rapid fire five ways that God forgave us.
[time=3154] First of all, God forgave us immediately. That rules out, I'll forgive you later, but it's going to take me a long time.
[time=3163] The Bible says that God forgave us while we were yet sinners.
[time=3170] Christ died for us.
[time=3174] Didn't say that after we cleaned up our act, God says, "Ah, I can live with that.
[time=3179] Okay, I'll forgive you." When Jesus hung on the cross, he didn't say, "Oh you Romans and you Pharisees, you've really hurt me this time.
[time=3188] It's going to take me a long time before I'll forgive you." He hung on the cross and he said, "Father, forgive them.
[time=3196] They don't know what they're doing." He forgave us immediately.
[time=3201] The story is told about Reverend Peter Miller.
[time=3204] Reverend Peter Miller wrote on his horse to meet George Washington and to plead for a pardon for a man in this community.
[time=3211] Washington said, "I'm sorry. For what he has done, I cannot pardon your friend."
[time=3217] Miller said, "My friend, he's the worst scoundrel our community has known, and he's the worst enemy I've ever had. He's no friend of mine." George Washington was so moved that Miller was there pleading for his enemy, not his friend,
[time=3231] that he granted that pardon. Put it in Miller's hand and Miller rode by horseback to the point of execution. The man about to be executed said, "There's Miller.
[time=3240] Come to pay me back for all the years that I've caused him pain.
[time=3245] Come the globe at my hanging have you." Miller pulled out of his pocket and an envelope and the man opened it up and there was a pardon.
[time=3254] And Peter Miller loved him while he was still cursing him.
[time=3257] He loved him while he was still behaving like an enemy.
[time=3260] He immediately forgave him what he had done.
[time=3265] If we don't forgive immediately, we're just allowing time for two things, time for us to grow bitter and time for us to poison someone else.
[time=3274] The second way the Lord forgave us is he forgave us freely.
[time=3278] That rules out, "I'll forgive you if you fix everything and make it right."
[time=3284] We can't fix everything that we've done by way of sin against God and make it right.
[time=3289] Can't be done.
[time=3291] But Ephesians 1-7 says, "God forgave us according to His riches."
[time=3298] The riches of His grace. It was out of His bank account and it was an infinite one.
[time=3304] Grace stands for everything that God wants to do and can do for us free.
[time=3309] Thirdly, God forgave abundantly.
[time=3312] That means that He forgave not saying, "I can forgive all most of the things, but not everything."
[time=3323] He says, "I forgive it abundantly." In Romans 5 it says, "We're sinned at abound or where fences did abound." God's grace abounded all the more.
[time=3336] God forgives thoroughly.
[time=3338] That means that when He forgives it, it's done.
[time=3342] He doesn't bring it up again.
[time=3344] In Psalm 103 the Bible says that God removes our sin as far as the east is from the west.
[time=3351] He says He puts Him behind His back and He remembers them no more in Isaiah.
[time=3355] In 1 John he says He washes and they're clean.
[time=3358] He doesn't bring Him up again.
[time=3360] A couple walked into the counselor's office and he was upset.
[time=3363] He said, "I'll tell you what's wrong with her." She is historical.
[time=3367] The counselor said, "Come down." You mean she's hysterical, don't you?
[time=3371] No, I mean she's historical.
[time=3372] She keeps bringing things up again and again and again.
[time=3378] God says, "When I forgive you, I don't bring them up again and again and again because I've forgiven you thoroughly."
[time=3386] The fifth way that God forgives us is repeatedly.
[time=3390] God rules out us saying, "No, I can't forgive you, but I will if it never happens again."
[time=3397] God forgives us and the Bible says that He knows us that we are of clay and we'll do it again and He takes the chance and He forgives anyway.
[time=3405] He forgives repeatedly.
[time=3410] The Bible says two things. One, we all need forgiveness.
[time=3419] And two, we all need to forgive.
[time=3424] And finally, God has inseparably linked those together.
[time=3430] If we do not forgive, He cannot forgive us.
[time=3435] And if we are to forgive, we are to forgive just as He forgave us immediately, abundantly, freely, thoroughly and repeatedly.
[time=3451] Those are hard words.
[time=3453] They're tough to hear. They're even tougher to live by.
[time=3459] But God says, "If you want my forgiveness, you need to forgive."
[time=3482] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, the handbell choir and soloist Lisa Reniker.
[time=3489] The message today on forgiveness was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3493] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3501] Let's bow together.
[time=3503] Dear Heavenly Father, I know that I'm a sinner today and I have created and committed sins that I think are unforgivable.
[time=3511] But I know through your word that you will forgive us, you promise to do that.
[time=3516] And today I ask you to take away my sins and to cleanse my heart today.
[time=3521] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3525] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
