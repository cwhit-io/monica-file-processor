[time=0] (beeping) - Most of us are only cautiously excited about heaven.
[time=25] Heaven's okay, it's death that diminishes our enthusiasm.
[time=31] A Sunday school teacher asked her class, "How many of you would like to go to heaven?" All of them raised their hand, except for one little boy.
[time=39] She turned to him and said, "Well, honey, "don't you want to go to heaven someday?" He looked up and affirmatively assured her that he wanted to.
[time=48] The teacher said, "Well, why didn't you raise your hand?" He said, "Well, I thought you were trying "to get a group to go right now." (upbeat music)
[time=60] [MUSIC]
[time=68] - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=73] Thank you for joining us.
[time=75] Rick's message today is entitled, "What the Bible Says About Death." Each of us are like the little boy who wants to go to heaven.
[time=83] We want to go, but just not in any hurry.
[time=86] Death is hard to face, it is an unknown.
[time=89] Be fearful.
[time=91] Today, we will study what the Bible says about death.
[time=94] Knowing God and His Word can dispel fear and anxiety.
[time=98] Jesus told his disciples facing death, "Let your heart be not troubled.
[time=103] "Neither let it be afraid." We hope that today's study will help each of us prepare to face death.
[time=110] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of John.
[time=113] We will be looking at chapter 11, verses 19 through 27.
[time=119] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=124] Other special music includes a solo from Kevin Rowe, and Joni King.
[time=133] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk, Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=141] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=145] Now here's Rick.
[time=148] It is a joy to welcome you this morning to our second worship service as the day grows on the excitement builds with opportunities to declare that we love the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=162] And we love one another.
[time=163] That becomes a challenge.
[time=165] It's easy to love God who's up there.
[time=166] It's a little tougher than to love the guy next to you.
[time=169] We work on that and we fellowship together and we've come to this place to lift our voices up and worship Him.
[time=176] We've come today to give to God our worship and our praise.
[time=180] But as we give it, we receive the greatest fulfillment in life of knowing Him and declaring His goodness.
[time=186] We're delighted that you're here with us today.
[time=189] We also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=193] It's our purpose to declare Jesus Christ and to make Him known.
[time=197] And our choir leads us with a great song of praise that declares the greatness of our God.

[time=946] Pete, how is your family today?
[time=948] We're doing fine, Rick.
[time=949] Again, it's great to be in the house of the Lord.
[time=951] We really had a wonderful winter season.
[time=954] It seems like people have made an extra effort to come and worship with us each Sunday.
[time=958] They really have.
[time=959] And we're thankful you've joined us today for this hour.
[time=962] And we want to personally invite you Fort Wayne friends, our greater Fort Wayne friends, to a couple upcoming special services.
[time=970] Coming up on March the 24th, we'll be having our third annual Good Friday service.
[time=976] We leave our facilities here at Black Hawk and we move into the heart of our city and rent the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=982] And there we'll have a half-hour worship service over the lunch hour.
[time=987] From 1215 to 1245, we'll pack that hour with praise and worship, a time of inspiration and reflection.
[time=995] We'll use drama and music and the spoken Word of God.
[time=998] And we want to encourage you to set that time aside over the lunch hour on Good Friday to worship the Lord Jesus on that day.
[time=1006] And then two days later, it's Easter, a great opportunity of celebration that we're looking forward to.
[time=1012] Rick, we love the Christmas season as we enter into the birth of our Savior.
[time=1016] And then just a few months later, we culminate His life on earth here with His death and resurrection at Easter time.
[time=1023] And our Easter musical is going to be called at Calvary.
[time=1026] And we're just going to center our thoughts on the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=1030] There'll be a lot of good music from our choir and soloists and some monologues that are going to be directed by Rich Littiki,
[time=1038] one of our school teachers here in the Christian school.
[time=1041] Well, that will be a great event and we hope you'll set those dates aside to worship the Lord Jesus Christ with us.
[time=1049] A few weeks ago, we mentioned to you, we're taking a Bible hour survey.
[time=1054] This will be the last time we'll have opportunity to mention that to you.
[time=1058] But we're mailing out to all of our constituency for whom we have an address, a survey.
[time=1065] And the survey asks questions like what time is the Bible hour going to be best aired for you?
[time=1071] Would you like to see it at seven o'clock in Fort Wayne or eight o'clock or eleven o'clock?
[time=1075] We have a number of questions we need your input in order to make some decisions.
[time=1080] If you would like to be a part of that Bible hour survey, we need you to write today.
[time=1084] This will be the last time we'll mention it and we'll need to get your response back very quickly.
[time=1089] So we hope you will write for the Bible hour survey.
[time=1092] If you'd like to receive this survey right to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1102] Once again, we need for you to write today to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1112] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1114] While you're writing, we hope that you'll ask for a helpful booklet entitled "Griefs Healing Process."
[time=1121] As we study God's word today in a few moments, our message will focus on what the Bible says about death.
[time=1128] We're not just looking at facing our own death, but how do we cope with the grief associated with the death of our spouse, our life's partner?
[time=1137] What happens when we lose that individual?
[time=1139] How do we cope with the loss of other loved ones?
[time=1142] Perhaps our parents, our friends, or even most tragic, the death of our children?
[time=1147] This booklet will be a helpful tool for your heart to cope and to manage the grief.
[time=1153] And to know that it's part of God's design for healing our hurts, and we'll send you a copy.
[time=1159] Pete, would you give the address once again? Right to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1170] Thank you, and thank you for being a part of this hour today.
[time=1173] In a moment, we'll return to our morning worship service, and to whom will we have the pleasure of listening to?
[time=1179] Rick, Joanie King will be singing for us a great song.
[time=1182] It's entitled "In Heaven's Eyes, There Are No Losers." A great song of encouragement for those that might be discouraged today.
[time=1188] Well, I will enjoy that, and I'm sure you friends will as well.
[time=1218] You're the earthly Bible.
[time=1223] Heaven is the song.
[time=1231] This was the life of no distinction, no successes, only trials.
[time=1247] And looking down on this unloading one, there was love in Heaven's eyes.
[time=1266] In Heaven's eyes, There are no losers.
[time=1274] In Heaven's eyes, No this cause.
[time=1283] Only people will be with feelings like me, And were amazed by the grace we can't find.
[time=1298] In Heaven's eyes, No this cause.
[time=1315] I am a child, Though we were a father, The homeless dreadnold, In the rain, When life goes by and no one bothers.
[time=1338] Heaven feels that pain.
[time=1346] Looking down, God sees each heartache, He knows each so wrong.
[time=1357] And here's each hope, And looking up, We see compassion's fire, A blazing Heaven's eyes.
[time=1377] In Heaven's eyes, There are no losers.
[time=1385] Heaven's eyes, No hopeless cause.
[time=1393] Only people will be with feelings like me, And were amazed by the grace we can't find.
[time=1412] In Heaven's eyes, There are no losers.
[time=1420] In Heaven's eyes, No hopeless cause.
[time=1428] Only people will be with feelings like me.
[time=1438] And were amazed by the grace we can't find.
[time=1452] In Heaven's eyes.
[time=1477] We live in such a competitive world, Focused in on winning and losing.
[time=1484] Who can drive the golf ball the furthest? Who can bake the best pie?
[time=1490] Who's the best basketball player? Who has the highest intelligence in the group?
[time=1495] We're by nature competitive, And it's not all bad, But it's not all good either.
[time=1501] And it's so refreshing to know there's someone who loves you, And there's someone who loves me,
[time=1507] And he says there's not one of you who's a loser.
[time=1510] I love you. Jesus Christ doesn't care what your accomplishment or what your ranking is.
[time=1518] He wouldn't trade you for next year's first round draft pick and an undisclosed amount of cash or anything.
[time=1526] He loves you. One of the best kept secrets is not meant to be kept secret.
[time=1531] It's a ministry of our church called the Alive Counseling Center.
[time=1535] I've asked Lloyd Hicks, who's a friend of mine, partner in ministry, and the Director of the Counseling Center
[time=1541] to come tell us a little bit about that ministry.
[time=1544] Lloyd, we've had a Counseling Center here for a number of years.
[time=1547] You've been the Director of it for the past four or five.
[time=1550] But how did you get involved in Counseling?
[time=1553] I know you. I know you've been very successful in business.
[time=1556] But in the middle of life, you entered into Counseling. How did that come about?
[time=1560] Well, my wife and I have been for many years involved in people's lives.
[time=1563] And Dr. Nichols, when he came, provided great encouragement to pursue academic education to help people in a more professional fashion.
[time=1573] When you say academic education, what did you have to go through to prepare to counsel?
[time=1578] I pursued a master's degree in Counseling.
[time=1582] And included in that, or in addition to that, I should say, the requirements for a master's degree in clinical psychology.
[time=1589] A total of 60 hours.
[time=1591] That's an extensive education. With that background, through the Counseling Center, you and the other counselors,
[time=1597] what type of helps available to our people and to the community?
[time=1601] Yes, we provide individual marriage and family counseling to those that have particular need,
[time=1608] particularly those of members and friends of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1611] The issues we work with are things such as depression, grief, anger, anxiety, self-esteem, abuse.
[time=1619] Those are routine issues.
[time=1621] Could you see me at one o'clock today?
[time=1624] Tomorrow.
[time=1627] I may be there, but that's so refreshing to know there's professional help there that's available.
[time=1633] Lloyd, I know that you don't need the income, you don't need a second job, you don't need the late hours,
[time=1639] you don't need the crisis phone calls, all that leads me to say to them, why do you counsel?
[time=1645] We try to provide to members and friends of Black Hawk Baptist Church professional services.
[time=1651] We do it through assessment of their needs, we do it through meeting their emotional and spiritual needs, trying to address the total person, not just the psychological needs.
[time=1660] There are rewards from that.
[time=1662] It's great encouragement to me to have someone going through a tremendous amount of strife and struggling their lives, to see them gain stability, to begin growing spiritually, and then attending church and worshiping here with us often at Black Hawk.
[time=1677] And once they've come that far, then to hear them comment about some of their friends who are going through troubles,
[time=1683] and they say, you know their greatest need is Jesus Christ in their life.
[time=1687] Boy, you can't be to reward like that, one that lasts forever.
[time=1691] Lloyd, thanks for your partnership in the ministry here.
[time=1695] We wanted to take a few moments today so that many of you would know that we do have a counseling ministry.
[time=1701] Here at Black Hawk, we provide normal pastoral counseling on a regular part of the church's ministry.
[time=1708] That of course is a free counseling service. I do a lot of that.
[time=1712] Pastor Lampman does. Tim, Steve, the entire compliment of our pastoral staff work with people.
[time=1718] But there comes needs that go beyond normal, go beyond pastoral counseling, where does an individual turn to with some of those problems that Lloyd identified?
[time=1727] We as a church apply a counseling center ministry.
[time=1731] It is on a per fee basis, but it's a very reduced fee compared to the cost that you would find in the rest of the industry.
[time=1739] We provide that out of ministry. And we wanted to know that that type of help was available.
[time=1745] Now I'd like to invite you to bow with me that we could pray together.
[time=1750] Father, many today are going through the deep pain of life, feeling like nobody cares.
[time=1758] We hurt today for that lady whose last relative in town has moved a long way away,
[time=1766] who feels that nobody cares.
[time=1769] She's in her senior years and she's going through life's greatest changes when she has the least control.
[time=1776] Help her to date and know that you care.
[time=1780] Father, we pray for that man who's caught in the middle.
[time=1783] The grind is above him and the corporate ladder and the grind is below him and he gets squeezed.
[time=1789] Precious put on him from both ends and he feels like no one cares.
[time=1795] Help him to date a sense that you care.
[time=1799] Father, we pray for that young person today who's experimenting with drugs,
[time=1805] experimenting with alcohol because they don't feel that anybody really cares.
[time=1811] Help them to date and know that you care.
[time=1815] Father, we pray today for that one who has lost a loved one.
[time=1819] They know the meaning of the valley and the shadow of death and its grim.
[time=1824] Help them to know that you care.
[time=1827] We pray specifically for those who are going through serious battles.
[time=1832] We pray that as Gerald Swanson fights for his recovery from a stroke, even being moved tomorrow to Parkview that his heart would know that you care.
[time=1842] That you'd sustain his son, David, daughter, Kathy and their families and partner, Marilyn.
[time=1849] We pray for Bob Vanetta as he tries to help his family as his father recovers from heart attack
[time=1855] while his mother goes through surgery.
[time=1858] We pray today for Dave Rennaker as he faces the potential of a second surgery on his back.
[time=1865] For our dean and others who are battling with cancer, for those who feel like they would trade their health if they could just find a job that was adequate.
[time=1877] God, the burdens are great, but as Kevin's saying, you offer rest.
[time=1882] We feel like we're losing, but Joni's reminded us there are no losers.
[time=1887] And so today, as we give you our worship, we also ask to get from you a refreshment of our spirits in Jesus' name.
[time=1896] [AMEN] Heaven is a popular subject. Nearly every one of us is excited to get there.
[time=1905] We're just not in a particular hurry.
[time=1908] Sunday School teacher was going over with her class how wonderful Heaven was going to be and all the great things that were going to be there.
[time=1915] And then she said, "How many of you would like to go to Heaven?" And boy, hands shot up immediately.
[time=1921] And then she noticed right over there little Joni didn't raise his hand.
[time=1925] And she wondered, "Why is it Joni wouldn't want to go to Heaven?" Everybody else wanted to, but Joni didn't.
[time=1931] So she looked at Joni and she said, "Joni, don't you want to go to Heaven someday?" He said, "Oh, someday, sure, I thought you were getting a group together to go today.
[time=1940] That's why I didn't raise my hand." The same points driven home about two golfers, Fred and Charlie.
[time=1947] They golfed together every Saturday.
[time=1949] Same course, lied on their score together.
[time=1952] They just played every Saturday together.
[time=1954] Charlie died.
[time=1956] But before Charlie died, Fred and Charlie had agreed if there was ever a way that one could come back from the other side,
[time=1962] that whoever died first would come back and meet the other one at the regular golf course, regular day, regular time on the 8th tee.
[time=1970] So Fred kept playing golf and sure enough one day, right there on the 8th tee, he sees this feign apparition.
[time=1977] And he hears a voice and it's Charlie's voice.
[time=1980] He said, "Oh, Charlie, it'd just be so great if we could play together again." "Charlie, do they have golf courses in Heaven?" Charlie said, "Oh, they do, and I've got some bad news." But the good news is the golf courses in Heaven are better than you have ever imagined.
[time=1996] The bad news is we're playing together next Saturday.
[time=1999] We've got a tee time.
[time=2002] Oh, we're all excited about Heaven just not in any hurry to get there.
[time=2006] The subject of death and dying is a hard one to face on any occasion.
[time=2012] The Bible teaches us some great, helpful, practical truth about what God has to say about death.
[time=2020] If you have a Bible with you, I invite you to open it to the New Testament.
[time=2024] There are four accounts of the life of Christ.
[time=2027] We call them the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[time=2031] And we're in John, chapter 11. All of John, chapter 11, it's a lengthy chapter over 50-some verses.
[time=2039] And even spilling into chapter 12 is a continual narrative of one of the more familiar stories out of the life of Christ.
[time=2048] If you've ever seen the movies, the King of Kings, or any of the other movies on the life of Christ,
[time=2055] usually one of the focal stories is Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead.
[time=2061] That's what we have here in John, chapter 11, and spilling over into chapter 12.
[time=2067] If I was to read the 57 verses, the time would be gone.
[time=2071] So allow me to highlight for you some thoughts and then focus in on these verses, verses 19 through 27.
[time=2079] It's right in the middle of the narrative.
[time=2081] And many Jews had come to Mary and Martha.
[time=2085] Those are Lazarus' sisters to comfort them in the loss of their brother.
[time=2090] When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
[time=2098] "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
[time=2106] But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."
[time=2112] Jesus said to her, "your brother will rise again."
[time=2119] Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
[time=2125] Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=2131] He who believes in me will live even though he dies.
[time=2136] And whoever lives and believes in me will never die." "Do you believe this?" "Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who was the come into the world."
[time=2152] This story gives us some great insight on facing death and dying.
[time=2160] In a few moments the narrative will explode with excitement in life when Jesus stands outside.
[time=2166] Lazarus' tomb and yells, "Lazarus come forth and suddenly a dead man in grave clothes walks out."
[time=2176] But through this it answers at least these three very practical questions that usually nag at all of us.
[time=2184] Question number one is, "how do I define death?" I mean, was Lazarus really dead?
[time=2189] What about all those people we read about and readers died just who died and saw this great light, went down a long tunnel, discovered their mother-in-law was at the other end, and came back?
[time=2199] How do we explain all that?
[time=2202] How do we define death?
[time=2205] The second question is a little bit more helpful to live with.
[time=2209] How do we face death?
[time=2211] And then finally, how do we prepare for death?
[time=2214] Well, in this passage it does raise some questions about defining death.
[time=2220] And that's not an easy term to define medically, what is death?
[time=2226] A doctor who was a friend of mine helped me a great deal yesterday.
[time=2229] We went through a number of books on pathology and medical journals and indexes, and we were troubled to find a real clear definition of death.
[time=2241] He then suggested that it's actually when one achieves equilibrium with his environment.
[time=2247] Now that sounds strange, but I had that term explained to me by my lawyer a couple years ago when I had my will drawn up.
[time=2254] He said, "death is when you achieve room temperature." That's equilibrium with your environment.
[time=2261] But it is a very difficult thing to say, "this is death."
[time=2267] It becomes even more complicated when we are in that gray zone between those who are dying and may be dead, but yet they may be alive.
[time=2278] And we have used wonderful artificial means to sustain them
[time=2285] in the hopes that they will recover and support life on their own.
[time=2289] Things like the famous respirators and inhalators that oxygenate our bodies.
[time=2296] Medications that will support and sustain blood pressure when it could not otherwise be there.
[time=2302] Electrical shocks that start hearts that have stopped.
[time=2307] We live in a wonderful age when all that's available, but the question becomes how do we know if that person is really alive or whether that person is being sustained artificially?
[time=2318] How do we know when to say they're gone and to take the machines and the medications away?
[time=2324] And to say it is here, death is coming.
[time=2328] Well, medically, I've learned that what they best can use is an EEG, an electrical encephalogram,
[time=2335] that measures brain waves.
[time=2338] If that is flat, we then believe the individual is dead and the term is called brain dead.
[time=2346] But a second EEG must be done not sooner than six hours later to confirm all of that.
[time=2353] I share all that with you to say it's very perplexing to know in that gray zone what is death?
[time=2361] Actually, we can define death in a simple word separation.
[time=2366] Death occurs when life leaves the body.
[time=2371] At that moment of separation, biologically, medically, you're dead.
[time=2377] When life leaves the body irreversibly.
[time=2382] Spiritually, the definition is very, very similar.
[time=2386] Although when we come to the Bible, we're not using electrocardical grams, electrical encephalograms,
[time=2393] highly technical equipment, the definition comes down very similar to separation.
[time=2399] The Bible defines death as when you're separated, your body, from your spirit.
[time=2406] James chapter 2 verse 26 says, "As the body without the spirit is dead, so our faith is dead without works."
[time=2416] But there's even a broader spiritual definition of death than that.
[time=2420] It is spiritual death.
[time=2423] That is when our spirit is separated from God's spirit.
[time=2429] Well, even though we've wrestled through all of that, what do we say about the reports in various magazines about supposed deaths
[time=2439] that were followed by supposed resurrections, which were followed by supposed testimonies of what is on the other side of death's door?
[time=2449] Well, I'm of the clear conviction and so are the doctors that I've talked to about it, that these are not deaths and these are not resurrections.
[time=2460] What we're actually dealing with is a near-death experience.
[time=2466] That a person will go into a heart and pulmonary condition where they are nearly dead.
[time=2474] But they've never had a resuscitation, a resurrection of someone who was described as dead through a brain death.
[time=2484] But an individual looks and appears to have died because their heart has stopped beating and their respiratory system appears to have stopped.
[time=2498] And then they are resuscitated somehow within a matter of seconds or at the most minutes.
[time=2506] And then, having been resuscitated, they give account of what they experienced in those brief moments.
[time=2513] It's my firm, strong conviction that these people didn't die.
[time=2518] They didn't go to heaven. They didn't come back to earth and now have an authoritative witness.
[time=2525] Several reasons. First of all, the people really didn't die.
[time=2530] They were simply near-death and resuscitated.
[time=2535] When you read the story of Lazarus at length, you'll discover that Lazarus wasn't dead for a few seconds, he was dead for four days.
[time=2544] And Jesus said he was dead. The mourners who were there said he was dead. His sister said he was dead.
[time=2553] And even Jesus' enemies knew that he was dead, could not explain away the miracle.
[time=2559] And so they said, "The only thing we can do to put this all the science is to kill Jesus and to kill Lazarus." And when we're both done with that, then we won't have to hear about it anymore.
[time=2570] But the ultimate remark is that they said, "Don't open the tomb for he is already decomposing."
[time=2587] He was dead. When we read these resuscitation articles, we're not talking about people who were dead for four days,
[time=2595] buried, being opened up out of the grave and then being restored.
[time=2600] Another point to be made is that everyone who has one of these "testimonies" from the other side of death door,
[time=2608] their experience is exactly what they were preconditioned to experience.
[time=2613] What I mean is that if you grew up in a somewhat of a Christian environment, when you went through the door of heaven, you saw Jesus.
[time=2621] But if somebody came from a Hindu or a Buddhist background, their experience, they didn't see Jesus.
[time=2626] They saw what their religion had preconditioned them to see.
[time=2631] And the final thing is that even though there are some similarities going down a long tunnel seeing a bright light,
[time=2638] none of the accounts confirm each other. They only contradict each other.
[time=2644] What is death? It is that moment when God takes the spirit of a man, the soul of a person, and he says,
[time=2654] "Your life is now ended, and I take you to stand before me."
[time=2660] It's irreversible. Other than a few miracles that God performed, such as this one, it is that final separation.
[time=2670] But from this passage, we can even come to a more practical question.
[time=2674] It is the question, "How do we face death and dying?" Our own are the one that we love so dearly. How do we face that death?
[time=2685] There are a variety of emotions that immediately spark in this text.
[time=2689] One of the emotions is this one. Somebody do something.
[time=2694] Whenever we are in the midst of a crisis, our response is almost always somebody do something, and their first response was,
[time=2702] Lazarus is dying, somebody do something, somebody go get Jesus.
[time=2707] Another response in this passage is the response of Mary and Martha.
[time=2712] Both of them, when they see Jesus, there is a hint of anger.
[time=2716] They say, "Jesus, if you would have been here, if you would have done something, my brother would not have died."
[time=2723] Anger.
[time=2726] There is the hint of grief. Jesus wept.
[time=2731] Mary and Martha were in need of comfort.
[time=2734] We go through a variety of emotions, and people both on the secular and the biblical side agree that there are these six emotions which we will encounter.
[time=2744] We will encounter these at various times, not necessarily in this order.
[time=2750] We will move through a cycle indiscriminately.
[time=2754] Allow me to give you those six emotions. We've already hinted at some.
[time=2758] The first emotion that we often have is the emotion of denial.
[time=2763] "Ah, you don't mean that doc. I'm as strong as a horse. I feel great. I can't have cancer, not me."
[time=2773] It's denial. It's that inner person saying, "Can't happen to me. That can't happen to my dad. Can't happen to the one I love."
[time=2786] Peter was a denier. Jesus said, "I'm going to go to Jerusalem. Sounds great," said the disciples.
[time=2793] "I'm going to suffer. Hold the phone. I'm going to die." Peter says, "No. I won't let it happen."
[time=2802] I was visiting a friend, not from this church in the hospital, in Rush to family member hearing that their loved one had cancer.
[time=2809] The friend was laying in bed. The family member threw themselves on the bed and looked up and said, "You won't die, Dad, because I won't let you."
[time=2820] I stood there and smiled and didn't say a word, but I thought, "I'm sorry, but none of us get a vote. We don't have any control."
[time=2831] But denial says, "I can stop this. I can keep it from happening." A second emotion that we go through is anger. I think Mary and Martha both had some of that. Why didn't somebody do something? Why didn't the doctors do more?
[time=2847] Why didn't Dad take better care of himself? I'm angry at him for dying on me.
[time=2854] Anger is harsh. It's indiscriminate and it explodes. People are often angry at the doctor when the doctor did everything and more than should have been expected, but it couldn't be changed.
[time=2868] People are angry at those that had nothing to do with it. Perhaps the funeral director or the one who comes over with a cake simply to say, "I care."
[time=2879] Job had lost four sons. He immediately responded in a very positive way, but as days grew on and health grew worse, he turned from acceptance to anger.
[time=2890] He said, verse 1 of chapter 10 of Job, "I loathe my very life. Therefore, I will give free reign to my complaint and I will speak out of the bitterness of my soul. I've had it."
[time=2903] And you're going to hear about it. "I'm miserable, and if I can't be happy, the least I can do is make everyone around me miserable too."
[time=2912] That's a common emotion. A third emotion that we often go through is bargaining. The doctor will say, "I'm sorry. We've done all that we can, and your heart is not strong and it'll last a while, but you probably won't live more than a year or two."
[time=2932] And the man says, "Ah, come on, Doc. You can give me a couple more years, can't you? As though the doctor is the one who said, "I really only want to give you two, so two is all you're getting."
[time=2945] Now, the doctor is just telling you as best he understands what's going to happen. "Ah, come on, Doc. You don't mean that. Well, we'll take it back to a committee, and if you get a majority vote, we'll give you five."
[time=2956] That's not how it works. And usually we want to bargain after the fact. If I quit eating fried food, if I quit smoking, if I quit drinking alcohol, if I start jogging and they start listing all the things that they will now do in a way of bargaining, will that buy me more time?
[time=2977] And the answer is it would have had you done it for a lifetime, but now it probably won't make a lot of difference.
[time=2985] David was bargaining. God said, "David, your son's going to die." And David fell on his knees and he wept and he prayed and he fasted it. The baby died.
[time=2995] The people came and said, "David, your child's died." And David got up and went and got something to eat. They said, "Aren't you going to fast and pray? The baby's died."
[time=3002] David said, "No, I fast and prayed while he was alive. The bargain with God. He's gone now. It's over."
[time=3011] The next emotion that we often encounter is the emotion of depression. Jacob represents that so clearly. Jacob is told and he believes that his son, Joseph, is dead.
[time=3024] And he says this in Genesis 37, 35, "All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted."
[time=3037] "No," he said, "in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son." He said, "Don't try to comfort me. My son is gone and I will die mourning.
[time=3051] I'm depressed. I will not recover. I'll live out my days in this mood."
[time=3058] Depression is a normal response, but it's even at its greatest when we lose either our life's partner or our children.
[time=3068] In life, there are two issues that are paramount to us. They are my life's partner and my life's purpose.
[time=3077] Let me use my life in this example. Kathy is my life's partner. My life's purpose is this church.
[time=3084] If I lose my job and we're not having any vote on that today, so don't draw for a pencil, I still have my life's partner.
[time=3093] If Kathy should be tragically taken away from me, I lose my partner, but I still have my life's purpose.
[time=3100] But the older we grow, the more it becomes that our life's partner is our life's purpose.
[time=3107] And so when somebody in their senior years loses their spouse, my purpose was to be with them.
[time=3113] My purpose was to take care of her. My purpose was to cook his meals. My purpose was that partner.
[time=3121] And when we lose our partner, we lose our purpose and death takes both away from us.
[time=3132] And the hardest thing is to say, "By God's grace, somehow in his plan he's taken my partner, but he's left me."
[time=3141] Therefore, he must have purpose for me and to say, "I will discover a new life's purpose."
[time=3149] It'll be the hardest thing an individual does. And many individuals choose exactly what Jacob chose.
[time=3156] He said, "I refuse to be comforted. We choose to stay depressed. We can't keep it from coming, but we can keep it from leaving, and we choose to be depressed."
[time=3168] Because we refuse to find a new life's purpose.
[time=3172] The same thing happens to parents who lose children. At this point in my life, I get up on Wednesday mornings very, very early to learn spelling words.
[time=3181] I've learned how to spell third, thick, that, those, and 30 words that began with TH this past week.
[time=3191] Because I have a little girl who's learning to do that.
[time=3194] My life's purpose is to train a dog to go on the papers and not the carpet.
[time=3199] I didn't want a dog, but I have little children. They wanted that dog.
[time=3202] My life's purpose, in part, is to be a father.
[time=3206] And if I lose one of those children, somebody came and they not only took that individual that I love so dearly, but they took part of my purpose.
[time=3215] And now, why should I get up in the morning? That was my purpose.
[time=3219] Why should I work to repair the house that was for them?
[time=3222] Why should we work to have a little vacation time? It was for them.
[time=3227] And often we get depressed because our purpose was a part of that person.
[time=3232] The next stage is acceptance. There's some great illustrations of acceptance in the Bible.
[time=3238] I like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The king said, "You either do this or you'll die." And they said, "We'll die." Fine. We'll die.
[time=3246] For the God we serve, he is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace.
[time=3251] And if he doesn't, then we die.
[time=3256] Esther was raised up by God as she was told for a time such as this.
[time=3262] The Jewish nation in Persia was about to be exterminated, and no one had the king's ear but the queen, Esther.
[time=3271] But even the queen could not go to speak to the king without being requested.
[time=3278] And now she decides that she will take the initiative to speak to the king.
[time=3283] And she's warned, "It will cost you your life." And Esther says, "If I die, I die."
[time=3294] That level of acceptance.
[time=3297] The final stage after acceptance is hope.
[time=3302] The Bible says, "As believers in Christ we sorrow." There isn't one thing wrong if you've lost a loved one if you're sorrowing today.
[time=3310] There's not one thing wrong with those tears.
[time=3312] There's not one thing wrong with feeling down about it.
[time=3316] But we sorrow, not as others who have no hope.
[time=3322] Because we have hope. And hope makes not ashamed.
[time=3326] And as we face death, we can say, "I know they're gone, and I know we will not play that golf force again.
[time=3333] We'll not sit by that fire again. We'll not sit across the table and look into each other's eyes
[time=3339] and know hearts without words being exchanged." But suddenly we'll be united together again with the Lord.
[time=3348] There's comfort in knowing that.
[time=3350] There is hope.
[time=3353] That's how we face it.
[time=3355] We move through emotions, and we may go from one to the other, and they may go out of sequence.
[time=3360] But there comes that steadfast hope that in Jesus Christ there is eternal life.
[time=3366] And we will be with Him.
[time=3369] There's coming a day when He comes again, and He'll take us all to have Him to be with Him.
[time=3373] And then it says, "So shall we all be together with the Lord, united again."
[time=3381] The final question is, "How can I be ready for death?"
[time=3388] There are things to do physically, things to do emotionally, and things to do spiritually.
[time=3394] The most important is spiritual, and that is to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3400] Here He said to Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[time=3404] He who believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live."
[time=3418] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and soloist Kevin Rowe
[time=3434] and Joni King.
[time=3436] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3438] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3443] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3446] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3448] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that I have this opportunity to bow and tell you that I've committed sins,
[time=3456] and I'm ashamed of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3459] And I ask you to come into my heart and to cleanse me of those sins and be my Savior.
[time=3465] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3469] If you prayed that prayer and made a decision today, we'd like to have you write to us.
[time=3473] When you write to us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Your Decision," to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
