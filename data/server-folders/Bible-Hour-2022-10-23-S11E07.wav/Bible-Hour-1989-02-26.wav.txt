[time=28] Critics of the church often say that church is boring.
[time=32] It's not real, and it's certainly not relevant.
[time=36] Chuck Swindall illustrates their point with this little story.
[time=39] A camp speaker had tried all week through his messages to get the junior hires to participate.
[time=46] They wouldn't budge.
[time=47] Finally, he made the questions easier and easier and easier.
[time=52] And he asked, "What has a bushy tail?
[time=56] Is a brownish gray color, collects nuts for the winter time, and lives in the tree and runs all around this campground?" They wouldn't budge.
[time=65] Finally, one little boy in the back said, "Okay, I'll say it.
[time=70] Jesus Christ, but it sure sounds like a squirrel to me."

[time=88] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Haas.
[time=91] Thank you for joining us.
[time=93] Rick's message today is entitled, "A Church Worth Going To." Today we begin a new study on the Bible Hour.
[time=100] Over the next few weeks, Rick will be speaking from the Book of 1 Thessalonians during this series of messages.
[time=107] Today's study is titled, "A Church Worth Going To." Often we stay away from church because we don't find it to be real or relevant.
[time=116] Often outsiders label the church boring and hypocritical.
[time=120] Today we will discover the qualities of a church worth going to.
[time=125] We encourage you to have your Bibles open to the Book of 1 Thessalonians 1.
[time=130] You'll be looking at verses 1 through 3.
[time=133] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=138] Other special music includes a song from the children's choir and a solo from Susan Toyrath.
[time=147] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=156] We pray the Lord that we'll use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=160] That's what we want to do today as we are in this sanctuary to worship His name together.
[time=167] We also welcome those of you that are listening and watching by way of television to the Bible Hour.
[time=173] We get letters throughout the week that are of great encouragement of people that watch regularly and pray for the ministry here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=182] We're glad that you're all here, continue to be involved in our program.
[time=186] Worship is an active part in the reading of the Scripture and praying, giving of our ties and offering and the music and then the Word of God spoken by our pastor.
[time=197] The choir is going to sing now.
[time=199] A little later there are going to be some children that will be singing for us.
[time=202] The song that the choir is singing is "Let Everyone Praise the Lord Young and Old alike." We certainly have a song to sing because of Jesus Christ in our heart.
[time=227] Listen to the numerous praises as you hear the little children sing.
[time=233] We are children of all ages, join our voices as we praise the King.
[time=239] Song of glory, song of celebration, singing in gladly Jesus we adore.
[time=245] Turn the braisiness of family, all God's children sing unto the Lord.
[time=252] Sing all of each children sing.
[time=261] Until the song is "Forgive us all care." We're all in nations raising people before the Lord goes by.
[time=272] Let our children song our rise for our joy and wonder come above.
[time=281] We are children, you are guys.
[time=285] Turn our voices echoing us all.
[time=288] Song of glory, song of celebration, singing in gladly Jesus we adore.
[time=294] Turn the braisiness of family, all God's children sing unto the Lord.
[time=301] Sing all of each children sing.
[time=310] Sing all of each children sing unto the Lord.
[time=378] Kneeling before the Lord most high, we have that privilege to bow before him and praise his name.
[time=383] I'm grateful that he allows us that privilege.
[time=386] We'll continue now with music, singing together, hymn number 21.
[time=391] Stand up and bless the Lord.
[time=393] Him number 21, we'll sing the first, fourth, and fifth stanzas together.
[time=399] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=473] Been a number of months now since we organized children's choirs that rehearse on Sunday evenings very faithfully.
[time=479] They all, various choirs, prepare musicals, present it during our springtime.
[time=485] Tonight we have the praise kids that will be presenting at six o'clock, the musical Cole before God uses kids.
[time=492] A great musical that helps our young people and things of the Lord and will have a message for you too.
[time=498] We're grateful for Debbie Johnson and Kerry Johnson who work with these praise kids.
[time=503] They're going to sing a song for you this morning that's part of that musical tonight.
[time=507] I'm hoping that you will come back and join with us at 6 p.m.
[time=511] [MUSIC]
[time=528] I love the Lord and I'm trusting Him every day.
[time=535] I love the Lord and He takes care of me.
[time=541] [MUSIC]
[time=544] I love the Lord and no matter what friends may say.
[time=550] [MUSIC]
[time=560] He made the whole wide world from the mountains to the sea.
[time=568] If He can make this world, He can take good care of me.
[time=576] [MUSIC]
[time=578] I love the Lord and no matter what comes my way.
[time=583] [MUSIC]
[time=586] I love the Lord and I know He loves me.
[time=590] [MUSIC]
[time=611] I love the Lord and I say what friends may say.
[time=616] [MUSIC]
[time=619] I love the Lord and I know He loves me.
[time=623] [MUSIC]
[time=627] I love the Lord and I'm trusting Him every day.
[time=633] [MUSIC]
[time=643] He made the whole wide world from the mountains to the sea.
[time=650] [MUSIC]
[time=652] If He can make this world, He can take good care of me.
[time=658] [MUSIC]
[time=661] I love the Lord and no matter what comes my way.
[time=666] [MUSIC]
[time=669] I love the Lord and I know He loves me.
[time=673] [MUSIC]
[time=683] I love the Lord and I know He loves me.
[time=692] [MUSIC]
[time=695] We've just had the privilege of hearing from one of us.
[time=702] The privilege of hearing from one of our children's choirs sing and that's always a joy for people whenever they can see children.
[time=709] Rick, they're the backbone of our church in the future generation and I am appreciative of all the people that work with our children's choirs.
[time=716] They usually meet on Sunday nights after we've had some preliminary parts of our service.
[time=721] They go into various rooms in our church and our adults have done just a marvelous job in not only teaching them music,
[time=727] but some of the content of the music is certainly scriptural and very helpful in their Christian growth.
[time=734] Well, I'm excited about it. I know I wasn't excited about it as an elementary student and I want to hope that none of our choir directors
[time=743] have to put up with any Ricky Hawkses out there. I was not a cooperative little one.
[time=747] I think that I wanted to. I probably are.
[time=750] Well, we hope that you've enjoyed the children singing today.
[time=753] That's always an encouragement when we see young lives learning to praise the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=759] We want to invite you to two upcoming special praise services.
[time=764] One is on Good Friday. The other is on Easter.
[time=767] On Good Friday, we have rented the Grand Wayne Center. We'll be in the ballroom that day from 1215 to 1245 right over the lunch hour.
[time=777] It's a short, brief, but powerful service. We've scheduled it at the lunch hour so that many of you can come during your lunch break.
[time=786] Lots of employers will give extra time off to attend a Good Friday service.
[time=791] We've scheduled it at the Grand Wayne Center in the heart of our town so it will be available to anyone who would like to come
[time=797] because of its central location. We want to invite you to join us at the Grand Wayne right over the lunch hour at 1215 on Good Friday.
[time=805] And then for Easter, we have a special musical program.
[time=808] Yes, Rick. It's always great to, a few months ago, talk about the birth of our Savior and then to follow up later at Easter
[time=815] and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. We're entitled to musical on Easter Sunday night, March 26th.
[time=821] He lives and we will just be again celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ with the choir singing many numbers.
[time=829] There'll be four or five monologues that enhance the story of the life of Jesus Christ and his eventual resurrection.
[time=837] Well, I'm looking forward to that. All music is great, whether it's Easter Christmas or otherwise, but there's something unique about Easter music
[time=846] because it declares the greatest miracle and the greatest story of all time, and that is Jesus Christ arose from the grave.
[time=855] We hope you'll be with us for both of those services. Circle your calendar and mark those dates now.
[time=861] We have a booklet we want to encourage you to write for, not only to write for, but to use on a daily basis.
[time=867] Many of you have already written and are using this booklet, but most of you have not.
[time=872] Its title is "A Closer Walk" and its title gives away its purpose.
[time=877] It's designed to help each of us have a closer walk with God.
[time=882] Many times people ask me as a pastor, "I need some help in studying the Bible on my own.
[time=888] I don't know where to turn. I don't know what to read. I've got no road map." Well, this booklet is an excellent road map. It'll take you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=899] This is a time of year when people often give up something in this season that we call Lent.
[time=905] Rather than give up something, I'd like to ask you to begin something.
[time=909] And that is to begin to walk closer with the Lord through reading his word daily.
[time=914] If you'd like a copy of this, we'll send you your copy free.
[time=918] You can receive your copy by writing to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=925] And the zip code is 46815.
[time=929] Just ask for the booklet "Closer Walk" at the Bible Hour 7400 East State,
[time=935] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=940] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=965] [MUSIC]
[time=970] Our holy Father, righteousness surrounds thee.
[time=982] Exalted King of all the earth.
[time=992] You can approach thy greatness.
[time=997] You can approach thy goal of light for the word home and God alone.
[time=1007] [MUSIC - 153 seconds]
[time=1175] Thank you, Sue.
[time=1176] [AMEN] Let's stand together and let's maintain this spirit that we have right now following that song as we quote our memory verse together,
[time=1184] lifting up praise to God as we've memorized his word.
[time=1188] If you haven't had a chance to memorize this verse, it's on the top of your announcement section of the bulletin.
[time=1193] I encourage you just to read along with us as we say it.
[time=1196] Matthew 624, "No one can serve two masters for he to people who hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[time=1209] You cannot serve both God and money." Matthew 624.
[time=1218] I invite you to now bow with me that we might pray together.
[time=1223] Our God this week, we have failed to live by the principle that we have spoken.
[time=1229] I must confess, I have served two masters this week.
[time=1233] I have struggled to serve you, but I have also surrendered and served self, self will, self ambition.
[time=1241] And so first of all, we come to you to seek forgiveness.
[time=1245] And today in Jesus' name to meet and to ask for cleansing, we ask you to take our sin, our shortcoming, and wash and make us new.
[time=1256] We ask you to take the gift of our worship today, our praise, our attentiveness, our words, and make them acceptable in your sight.
[time=1267] We pray today that you would meet with us that we might say at the end of an hour, God loves me.
[time=1275] I met with him today, and I've been assured that he loves me.
[time=1281] We pray this morning that there would come a comfort of heart to those who are struggling with the issues of life.
[time=1288] We pray for Mike Swame Sr. as his body is critical and perhaps near death from a car accident,
[time=1295] that in his heart, whatever level of consciousness he has today, he'll know that you're with him, even in the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=1304] We pray today for those who are battling with enemies like cancer, for Catherine Northrop and Harry Bennett, Arden Marker, and others who, it's chronic, it's fatiguing, it's too real.
[time=1320] We pray for those who are going through broken relationships that you'll mend and restore and heal.
[time=1326] We pray that you would meet with us today and through your word that you would teach in a way that no human, particularly this one, could ever teach.
[time=1335] We pray that your word would come alive and it would be real.
[time=1339] You'd make of this place a church worth going to. In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1350] He got out of bed rather slowly and muttered to the lady of the house, "I'm not going to school today."
[time=1357] She said, "Oh, yes, you are." He said, "Oh, no, I'm not. I'm not going back to that school today or ever again."
[time=1364] She said, "Well, why?" He said, "Because none of the kids like me, they all call me mean names." She said, "You still have to go to school. Why don't you want to go to school?"
[time=1377] "Well, along with the kids, the teachers don't like me. They all talk about me behind my back. I'm not going to school."
[time=1384] She said, "Yes, you are." He said, "Well, give me one good reason why I should." She said, "Because you're the principal." There are days that teachers and principals don't want to go to school anymore than Johnny does.
[time=1399] There are days that we don't want to go to church.
[time=1402] Why should we go to church?
[time=1404] The survey was taken of people who didn't go to church and asked them why they didn't go to church.
[time=1409] They gave a variety of reasons amongst those where it's boring.
[time=1413] I haven't been there in years, but if I go back, I'll know exactly what they do because they did it the last time I was there.
[time=1420] It's not relevant. It doesn't scratch where I live. It's not real.
[time=1426] They talk about places and people and things and events that I've never heard of, and if I had, I would not sure I'd believe it.
[time=1436] It's church worth going to.
[time=1438] Whenever it's my privilege to wake up my son, I'll wake him up and occasionally I'll say, "Dad, what is today? Is it a school day?"
[time=1446] And if it's a school day and I say, "Yes," he goes, "Okay." He comforts himself with the fact that in every school day there's at least a brief moment called recess.
[time=1456] He wakes up and he says, "Dad, is it a cartoon day?" And I say, "Yes, it's Saturday. It's a cartoon day. Boy, he's alive." And if it's my lot to wake him up and he says, "Today, a church day, Dad." If it's Sunday and I say, "It's a church day." He said, "Oh, wats." Maybe that's how you felt this morning. You might be able to get your R in there and say, "Rats." But he's saying, "Why go to church? What makes church worth going to?"
[time=1487] A lot of times when we come to church, we hear messages that just don't seem real to us.
[time=1493] They don't seem to strike at life where it itches us.
[time=1497] They seem to be words that we sort of recognize, but most of them we don't.
[time=1502] And the end of the story, we're not sure even what it was said.
[time=1505] It's a lot like Louis Carroll's Jabberwacky.
[time=1508] Let me read a few lines of it for you. A friend passed this on.
[time=1512] Twas Rilligan's slithy toves did gyre and jumble in the wobb and all mimsie were the barrow groves and the moan rafts out grave.
[time=1520] Beware the Jabberwacky, my son, the claws that bite and scratch.
[time=1524] Beware the jub jub bourbon, shun the fumus, bandersnatch.
[time=1528] He took his vorpal sword in hand in a long time, the maxim foe he sawed, and he rested by the tumtum tree and thought, and there, a while he thought.
[time=1537] And in a ufish thought, he said, the Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, came whiffling through the toogel wood and burpled as it came.
[time=1546] One, two, one, two, and through and through.
[time=1549] The whirper blade went snicker-snack and left it dead with its head.
[time=1553] He went glumping back.
[time=1555] And has thou slain the Jabberwack come to my arms, my beamish boy.
[time=1559] Oh, frab just day, Kaloo Kalay, he collorted in his joy.
[time=1564] It was brilliant.
[time=1566] And the slithy toves did gyre and jumble in the wobb and all mimsie were the barrow groves and the moan rafts out grave.
[time=1573] What did that say?
[time=1575] I don't have the foggiest idea.
[time=1578] And too often we go to church and it's a lot like the Jabberwacky.
[time=1581] We walked out and said, what did he say?
[time=1584] I have no idea.
[time=1585] Wasn't that good?
[time=1586] Oh, that's good.
[time=1589] Is church real?
[time=1591] If you have a Bible today, I'd like to tell you about a church worth going to.
[time=1594] I'm in no way suggesting that it's ours.
[time=1597] It's a church called the Church of Thessaloniki.
[time=1601] It's written to us in two short letters by Paul called first and the second Thessalonians.
[time=1608] If you don't know how to find it, don't feel bad.
[time=1611] There's a road map called a Table of Contents in the front of your Bible.
[time=1615] You might want to find it and read along with us.
[time=1618] This Sunday and next we'll be talking about this church, the Church of Thessaloniki.
[time=1623] What made it a church worth going to?
[time=1626] I'd like to suggest there were three reasons.
[time=1629] One, they were real.
[time=1631] Two, they were relevant.
[time=1633] And three, they were radical.
[time=1635] We'll only cover the fact that they were real today.
[time=1638] But if you have your Bible, look at chapter one, first Thessalonians.
[time=1643] One, one through three.
[time=1645] Paul, Silas, and Timothy.
[time=1649] To the Church of Thessalonikens, in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1655] We always thank God for you, mentioning you and our prayers.
[time=1659] We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith.
[time=1665] Your labor prompted by love and your endurance inspired by hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1676] Why go to church?
[time=1678] Well, this was a church worth going to first and foremost because they were real.
[time=1683] The sub points, if you're a note taker and you have to have an outline, as they were real people who were written bitten by the real bug.
[time=1690] When we come to the Bible, notice that these are real names.
[time=1693] Real places, a real church and a real God.
[time=1696] Paul, Silas, Timothy.
[time=1699] Those were real people.
[time=1701] Too often we open up the Bible and it reads to us with our mind set like a nursery rhyme.
[time=1706] Once upon a time in a land far ago there were four little rabbits.
[time=1710] Flobsie, Mopsie, Cottontail and Peter, the Apostle.
[time=1716] And when we come to the Scriptures we say, is it just another one of those stories?
[time=1720] Are these real people?
[time=1722] And if we believe they're real people, do we really believe they did all these things that the Bible says they did?
[time=1728] They really did.
[time=1730] They were really real.
[time=1732] Last Sunday night we looked at the life in the book called Jonah.
[time=1736] You're probably familiar with the fact that the Bible declares that Jonah was indeed swallowed by a great fish.
[time=1742] What a privilege it was for me to study and to find out that in the Mediterranean Sea there are great fish sizable enough to swallow a man.
[time=1751] What a delight it was for me to learn that there have been whaling ships that have discovered that a man can be rescued out of the belly of a whale after being in there overnight.
[time=1760] It's a real story, but yet we come to it by faith.
[time=1764] And when we read the names of Paul and Timothy and Silas, they were real people who did real events.
[time=1771] Sometimes they're hard to believe.
[time=1773] A friend passed a cartoon on to me after last Sunday night's message.
[time=1777] He opens the door exhausted, looking more torn, and his wife looks at him with a snarl and said, what is it this time, Jonah?
[time=1786] You come home three days late, slimy and smelling like a fish.
[time=1791] Now what story do you expect me to swallow today?
[time=1796] That's real.
[time=1798] And Paul and Silas and Timothy were real people who gave their lives to Jesus Christ, and they said the purpose of my life is to know him and to make him known.
[time=1811] And these three men spent their lives going from city to city, people to people, country to country, continent to continent to declare Jesus Christ that he alone could come into their heart and change it completely.
[time=1830] And make of them not only someone who's forgiven of every air, shortcoming and sin, but someone who starts life all over like they were born again.
[time=1840] These were real people.
[time=1843] And they wrote to a real city.
[time=1846] I've never been to Thessaloniki.
[time=1848] I doubt that many of you have.
[time=1850] And in many ways it seems like some make believe, ephemeral city, but it was a real city.
[time=1857] And it was a city a lot like ours.
[time=1861] In Paul's day its population was approximately 200,000 people, just about the size of good old Fort Wayne.
[time=1869] In Paul's day it was the second principal city in the region, second only to Athens, just like our city is the second largest in our state behind Indianapolis.
[time=1879] It was a city that was named for a then famous person. She was the sister of Alexander the Great.
[time=1887] We are named for the famous Anthony Wayne.
[time=1891] It was a real place.
[time=1894] And in that place they had a real church.
[time=1897] I'm so thankful for this beautiful facility that God has given us.
[time=1902] We call it our church, but it's not really our church. It's our church's building.
[time=1908] Because you're the church. I'm the church.
[time=1910] The church never represented in the Bible. A place or an object that always represented people.
[time=1917] The word "church" actually is two words squished together that means the ones that came out.
[time=1924] Where did they come out of?
[time=1925] Well they were a group of people that some of them were plumbers, you say.
[time=1929] They had plumbing. It wasn't real good better than today, but it wasn't real good.
[time=1935] They were doctors and lawyers and ladies who taught school and practiced medicine.
[time=1942] People who had children and dogs and cats.
[time=1946] And out of that normal world, God called them out to be a unique body of people who would obey him and follow him.
[time=1956] And then he turns them out and sends them right back to where they were to represent him in their community.
[time=1964] These people were real. Their church was real. It wasn't a perfect church.
[time=1970] Just like this one is not a perfect church.
[time=1974] They had problems. As you skim the epistle you look at chapter 1 verse 6 and it says,
[time=1980] they had problems of suffering. When you look at chapter 2 verse 1, they had a problem with fear of failure.
[time=1987] I struggle with that one.
[time=1990] When you come to chapter 4 and chapter 4 verse 3, it says they had sexual misconduct.
[time=1997] It was a real church.
[time=1999] When you come later to chapter 4 verse 11, it says they had problems with freeloaders.
[time=2004] Those who didn't know the value and the ethic of work but only wanted to hitch their welfare to someone else.
[time=2012] In chapter 5, they had problems with forgiveness, all because they were real, just people who were real.
[time=2022] And then when you come past the people, the men there and the city and the church, there was a real God.
[time=2030] It was real. And somehow we've lost in our society the concept that Jesus Christ is real.
[time=2038] When we come to church, we just throw his name after everything and it makes no sense at all.
[time=2044] Chuck Swindall illustrates how people just casually use the name of Christ with this story.
[time=2050] The speaker at junior high camp had done everything he could to get the junior hires to participate, to discuss,
[time=2056] to ask questions and to answer them and no matter what question he asked, they would never answer.
[time=2062] So as the week went on, he made the questions easier and easier and easier and they still wouldn't respond.
[time=2068] So the last day in desperation, he says, "All right, I'm going to ask a question and I'm sure you can answer it.
[time=2073] I want somebody to answer it." What is about this big, summer gray, summer brown, has a long bushy tail, likes to climb trees, collects nuts for the winter,
[time=2083] lives in the hole in the tree and hibernates, runs all over the campground. Nobody would respond.
[time=2089] So we ran through the story again about collecting nuts, has a bushy tail, runs around the camp, and finally one kid in the back raises his hand and says, "Okay, I'll say it. Jesus, but it sure sounds like a squirrel to me."
[time=2104] And when we come to church, isn't that how where mindset is predisposed?
[time=2109] Okay, we're here to talk about Jesus. We can't tell you who he is. We don't know anything about him, but that's the God talk that we're about.
[time=2117] And that wasn't it. Paul says that he comes and greets them who are the church of God in Jesus Christ.
[time=2129] Did they ever dawn on you that this is God's church? It's not mine. Occasionally I'm with other pastors and they'll say, "Oh, how's your church doing?"
[time=2141] And I need to remember, I don't have one.
[time=2145] And when we go out into the community and we invite people, we need to always remember, this isn't our church, it's not our program.
[time=2153] It's him. And apart from the Lord Jesus Christ, we don't have anything to give him that's worth having.
[time=2160] No matter how beautiful the choir sings, no matter how humous the speaker may be, we don't have a thing to give people, except for the real Jesus Christ.
[time=2172] All that is to say, when you open up your Bible, remember these are real people who really did follow Christ.
[time=2180] The second thing I want to say about them being real people is that they were bitten by the real bug.
[time=2191] The year was 1849. Adventurers, explorers, miners, and anybody hoping to get rich quick headed for California.
[time=2199] The rumor was there's gold in them Dar hills. And men and women and all kinds of people headed for the gold rush and many of them struck it rich.
[time=2210] Many of them found gold and they pulled it out of the ground and became theirs.
[time=2216] And many of them in other parts dug into the ground and they pulled out their gold and they were elated and thrilled that they had struck it rich.
[time=2224] And they took it to the office of their sayer and they found out it wasn't gold, it was called fool's gold.
[time=2232] It looked like gold, it touched like gold, but it wasn't the real thing.
[time=2241] You know, there are people in every church, this one included, who haven't got the real thing.
[time=2246] They've got an appearance of Christ. They've got a language about Christ, but they haven't been bitten by the real bug.
[time=2253] One of the most beautiful mountain ranges in the world are the Grand Tetons of Wyoming.
[time=2259] And the majestic highest mountain of them all is called the Grand Teton.
[time=2265] And many a mountain climber drools with anticipation of conquering the Grand.
[time=2270] And as you approach it from one direction, you start at the foot of the mountain and you climb and you climb and you climb.
[time=2275] So you get to about 11,000 feet and at 11,000 feet you realize that you're on the wrong mountain.
[time=2282] For in front of the Grand was another mountain and the two looked as though they were one, but you couldn't see the valley in between.
[time=2289] And this shorter first mountain was rightfully named mount disappointment because it wasn't the real thing.
[time=2299] You know, as we come today, if you're a searcher, you're welcome here today.
[time=2304] You do not have to believe in Jesus Christ to feel wanted and welcome in our Sunday morning worship service.
[time=2310] Seekers are welcome. Maybe that's what the sign ought to say out front.
[time=2314] But many of you are past the seeking stage. You've been here. You know the stories.
[time=2320] And you know all the words, but you're not real. You haven't given your heart to Christ.
[time=2330] You haven't been bitten by the real bug.
[time=2335] In the worst tragedy we could ever commit would be to say, we're so glad you came.
[time=2340] We're so glad you learned to talk, Arlingo. We're so glad you know the ins and the outs of the Bibles that we peruse.
[time=2348] But if you really don't know him, it doesn't matter.
[time=2352] You've got to be bitten by the real bug.
[time=2355] And when you come to chapter 1, verses 2 and 3, Paul talks about how real their faith in Christ was.
[time=2363] He said, we always thank God for all of you.
[time=2368] Mentioning you in our prayers, we continually remember before our God and Father three things.
[time=2377] Your work of faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope.
[time=2385] How do you know if you've got the real thing?
[time=2389] Well here are three pretty good tests to see if you've been bitten by the real bug.
[time=2395] The first is your work of faith.
[time=2401] Now please don't misunderstand, we're not saying in order to become a believer in Jesus Christ you've got to do all the right work.
[time=2410] In order to become a Christian something I've got to go to church.
[time=2414] In order to become a Christian I've got to obey the Ten Commandments.
[time=2417] In order to become a Christian I've got to keep the golden rule.
[time=2420] In order to become a Christian I've got to give money.
[time=2422] What?
[time=2423] That's pushing it too far.
[time=2425] And you know you can do all those things and not be a believer in Jesus Christ.
[time=2430] And doing all those things won't make you a believer.
[time=2433] What makes a person a believer in Jesus Christ is one simple thing, it is faith in him.
[time=2441] Faith is looking at all the facts and saying there is enough evidence here for me to take the risk of trusting God.
[time=2450] I've seen a lot of him but I haven't seen enough that I can do it apart from a step of faith.
[time=2459] The Bible says without faith it's impossible to please God.
[time=2464] But then once we come to faith in Christ God's got a brand new plan for our life.
[time=2470] Because if we have faith it will turn around and it will produce the right type of work.
[time=2477] The first word we come to here work primarily speaks of a person's calling.
[time=2482] We talk about somebody what's your vocation? You may be a lawyer, a doctor, a nurse, a teacher, you may be a preacher.
[time=2491] Whatever that is that's your vocation. Vocation simply means you're calling.
[time=2496] And God says when you came to Christ out of that faith I've got to work for you, I've got a calling for you.
[time=2504] And Paul looked at these people and said wow I like this church, they're real.
[time=2511] They've been bitten by the real bug and you can see it because they're living out the way they were called.
[time=2517] Secondly he goes on to say that they had a labor, a labor that was prompted by love.
[time=2529] We use the words labor and works anonymously and at times they are that but there's a different emphasis here.
[time=2536] Work speaks of your calling, labor speaks of your effort.
[time=2541] Work can be stimulating, rewarding, occasionally even exhilarating speaks of the challenge in the goals.
[time=2550] Labor speaks of the effort, the toil, the exhaustion, and the fatigue.
[time=2558] To borrow a modern phrase it is this, when the going gets tough, the tough keep going.
[time=2567] There's a cute bumper sticker that says just the opposite, perfect for our society.
[time=2572] When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.
[time=2575] We can get out of this somehow, but here it says that these people had a calling and as they lived out that calling
[time=2583] there are times that it got weary, times that it got exhausting, a time when the labor was labor.
[time=2591] And they kept going because they were prompted by love.
[time=2597] Now the word love is one of the most overused words in our vocabulary.
[time=2603] Some of you have been around churches long enough to know that in the Bible there are a number of words used for love,
[time=2610] more than three, but there are three principal ones.
[time=2613] The first word that's used for love is a love that speaks out of attraction.
[time=2618] The Greek word is eros from which we get erotic, but it's not just a sexual term, it means anything that's attractive.
[time=2626] Anything that catches our eye and says, wow, I like that.
[time=2631] It may be a person that you mean, you say, I like that person, but it may be a car or a dress.
[time=2637] And if somebody comes up to you today and says, ah, your dress, it's beautiful, I love it.
[time=2642] We know they are not saying, I love your dress and I'd like to have a deep, meaningful, personal relationship with your dress.
[time=2650] No, it's a word that describes simply attractiveness.
[time=2654] There's a second word that speaks below the surface.
[time=2659] It digs a little bit deeper.
[time=2661] It's a word that speaks not only of attractiveness, but of affection.
[time=2665] Something that's reciprocal, like a brother who loves a brother.
[time=2669] Or like two people who've labored together and they've been bonded by their mutual commitments.
[time=2675] The word in Greek is phila-- oh, from which we get phila delphia.
[time=2681] And it's a deeper love.
[time=2684] But it's a love that kind of grows hot and grows cold based upon responsiveness.
[time=2690] Willard Harling, his book, His Needs, her Needs, talks about our mentality of a love bank.
[time=2696] That once we're attracted to somebody, we are even greater in love with them because they make deposits into our love bank.
[time=2704] And we turn around and make deposits into theirs.
[time=2707] And as the deposits grow, so does the love.
[time=2710] And then suddenly they're still making deposits.
[time=2713] They make a withdrawal and that hurts.
[time=2715] And maybe we make a withdrawal.
[time=2717] And suddenly the withdrawals exceeded the deposits and we say, "Where's the love that we had?"
[time=2723] It was a love based upon affection that was reciprocal.
[time=2728] But there's a third type of love.
[time=2731] It's a love that is deeper than attractiveness.
[time=2735] It's a love that's deeper than affection.
[time=2737] It's a love that speaks of all out commitment.
[time=2742] It says, "I love them even though they're not very attractive to me.
[time=2746] I love them even though I don't even know them." It is a purpose in life that says, "I love God and I'm learning to love what He loves.
[time=2756] And when I get tired and when I want to quit, it keeps me going."
[time=2764] The third thing that he highlighted in the lives of these people is that they had an endurance that was inspired by hope.
[time=2774] I don't know what comes to your mind when you hear the word endurance.
[time=2779] I think of the triathlete, the iron man or the iron woman.
[time=2783] I have occasionally caught it on television.
[time=2787] These are men and women who jump into the Bay of the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii
[time=2793] and they swim against the current a little over two miles.
[time=2797] Once they hit the opposite shore, they get out and they jog over to their bike
[time=2803] and they begin to bike 112 miles.
[time=2806] The exact distance it is from the Fort Wayne Marriott to Indianapolis.
[time=2812] And as soon as they get off their bike, they change shoes and without resting, they run a marathon.
[time=2820] I'm tired telling you about all that.
[time=2823] And they do that and the tragedy of it all is in the last mile that they run.
[time=2831] Of the marathon, they run it faster than I've ever run a mile in my life.
[time=2838] And they've got endurance.
[time=2841] Now why do I tell you that story?
[time=2843] I tell you that story because you and I, when we hear the word patience or endurance, we think of this passive person who sits back and says, "Well, there goes life and there's nothing I can do about it anyway."
[time=2857] And this word for endurance doesn't speak of passiveness.
[time=2861] It doesn't speak of resignation.
[time=2863] It speaks of fortitude and strength in the face of obstacles that says, "I will not quit." It's a high school swimmer.
[time=2874] I was so thankful that I swam the 50 freestyle.
[time=2878] There was an event called the 1500.
[time=2882] And I can remember Sebolts Batisie and Matt Gwen swimming that again and again next to each other.
[time=2888] And never was their time when one of them was more than one second ahead of the other.
[time=2893] And I can remember our coach saying, "It sure is anything." The man who will win is the one who refuses to quit.
[time=2901] Not necessarily the fastest, not necessarily the strongest,
[time=2907] but somewhere in that 16 minutes of agonizing swimming, one of them will hear a voice from within saying, "Quit." And whichever one of them says, "Yes, we'll lose."
[time=2923] As we look at our faith in Jesus Christ, they'll come days of agony.
[time=2927] They'll come days of trial.
[time=2929] God never said, "If you give your heart to Jesus, I promise you'll never have diversity again." Jesus said, "In this life you will have tribulation."
[time=2942] And endurance says, "I will not quit." How can a heart say, "I refuse to quit." What can be in a person that will say, "It's so real that I refuse to quit." It says here, "That endurance is inspired by hope."
[time=2961] Hope.
[time=2963] That is the strongest word in the Scripture.
[time=2967] When Alexander the Great had conquered all that he knew of as a world, he parsed it out into four sections, giving each of the sections to his four leading men.
[time=2977] And at the end of the division, they gladly received their reward.
[time=2981] But one of them looked at him and said, "But, sir, you have kept nothing for yourself."
[time=2987] Alexander said, "Oh, yes, I have. I have kept my hope." And hope is what drives a man.
[time=2994] Hope is what inspires a woman when their world is divided up and all of their resources are gone.
[time=3001] All of their challenges are taken away.
[time=3003] Everything that was dear is gone and a man says, "I still have my hope."
[time=3012] God occasionally puts us through the division of our kingdom, the loss of our job,
[time=3018] the heartbreaking departure of a disobedient child, the wrenching pain of a marriage that you labored under,
[time=3026] and they walked out.
[time=3029] What keeps you going?
[time=3031] Oh, in Jesus Christ, there's a hope that says, "I don't live for today." There's a hope that says, "I don't live for personal comfort." There's a hope that says, "I don't live for that child or that spouse or that job." There's a hope that says, "I live to hear him say when it's all over." Well done.
[time=3049] Thou good and faithful servant.
[time=3052] And the commitment of my heart is this, I will live in that hope. Come what may, I will live in that hope.
[time=3064] Forty men came to Christ.
[time=3067] They were part of the emperor's sharpest guard.
[time=3070] They were called his wrestlers, but they had come to Christ and they refused in the emperor's face
[time=3076] to raise a sword to slay one more man, and they were banished out on a frozen lake.
[time=3083] They were stripped naked and they were there to die, and they chanted.
[time=3087] Forty wrestlers, wrestling for thee, oh Christ, wrestling for thee and to win from thee, the crown of victory.
[time=3094] And one by one, they froze to death.
[time=3099] Stationed on this shore was a military installation, and all they had to do was to come back and to renounce Christ.
[time=3106] And one by one, they died.
[time=3111] Till the 39th died, and one man crawled back to renounce Christ.
[time=3119] And the guard on duty took off his clothes, ran out amongst the dead bodies,
[time=3126] and yelled, "40 wrestlers, wrestling for thee, oh Christ, to win for thee, the victory, to win from thee, the crown of life.
[time=3137] Hope, hope that says I'll live for Jesus Christ.
[time=3141] Hope that's so real that it transforms our life.
[time=3145] Hope that says I am angry and I'm sorry for the hurt that's come, but I will hope."
[time=3152] It is too soon to quit.
[time=3154] A hope that is so compelling that even our enemies would say it is so real
[time=3160] that I will be convinced that one of them who should fall will be replaced by me.
[time=3166] This church really worth going to.
[time=3171] It is if it's real.
[time=3174] See, these people that we read about were real people, and they were bitten by the real bug.
[time=3184] They weren't fools gold.
[time=3186] They weren't mount disappointment.
[time=3189] They didn't say it sure sounds like a scroll to me, but I'll say it.
[time=3193] Jesus, these were people who said, "I give my heart to him.
[time=3199] I will follow him because in my heart he gives a hope that is steadfast,
[time=3205] that is unchanging, that's unlovable."
[time=3211] Is church worth going to?
[time=3214] It is if it's real.
[time=3216] You know, so many times we look at church and we look at the Bible and we look at the message of faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3222] We don't say, "Well, it sounds good, but it's not the real world." Did it ever dawn on you?
[time=3227] It's the real world and the world of cars and houses and jobs and money and family really aren't the real world.
[time=3236] It's just a temporary place that we live to prepare for that real world.
[time=3242] William Temple put it this way.
[time=3244] He says, "Life is like a huge department store, and in the middle of the night somebody broke in." And they took all the price tags off things and then they went around putting new price tags on, but the price tags were all wrong.
[time=3258] And the price tag that went from a little pair of socks is now on a mink coat and the price that was on an outrageously expensive suit is now on a piece of underwear.
[time=3267] And we're all going into the department store and we're all making our purchases and we're all paying the wrong amount.
[time=3274] And we're paying too much for too many things that are worth too little.
[time=3284] And at the end of our purchase we say, "This can't be the real thing."
[time=3291] Oh beloved, would you give your heart to Jesus Christ?
[time=3295] He is the one who is real.
[time=3297] I pray that you will.
[time=3300] Or God and our Father as we bow before you today.
[time=3304] Help us not to think of you in the trite familiarity that we so casually do.
[time=3313] Help us to sense that you're real.
[time=3316] Change your heart today.
[time=3318] Make of one seeker, a pilgrim who has completed their journey.
[time=3324] And help there to be one or two or many who today would receive Jesus Christ as their Savior.
[time=3333] Father we pray for believers.
[time=3335] I pray for my own life that you'll keep me filled with faith and hope and love.
[time=3345] God my own heart would say quit.
[time=3348] But today put a fire in each one of us that won't quit.
[time=3352] Give us a burden to be winsome and then to win some to Christ.
[time=3360] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=3366] This morning as we end our service we end it with an invitation.
[time=3371] Now that may be unfamiliar to some of you.
[time=3374] What are we asking you to do?
[time=3376] On a moment Peter will come and we'll sing a hymn.
[time=3379] While we're singing we'll ask everyone to stand and to sing along.
[time=3383] I'll be here at the front.
[time=3385] We're asking those of you who've never given your heart to Christ and want to today to come here and meet me.
[time=3393] Do you mean you have to go forward in the church service to be a Christian?
[time=3396] No you don't.
[time=3397] But we're asking you to not be ashamed of him.
[time=3400] Like a wrestler, stand boldly for Christ.
[time=3404] I believe God has no secret agents.
[time=3408] Others of you may have received Christ.
[time=3411] But you've never made that public.
[time=3413] We invite you today to declare your love for him.
[time=3417] I hope that you found that this worship hour was inspiring for your life today.
[time=3435] We shared with you the ministry of our sanctuary choir and praise kids and soloist Susan Toyrak.
[time=3441] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3444] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision for Jesus Christ just before we close.
[time=3449] I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3452] Will you bow with me?
[time=3454] Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to be born on this earth
[time=3461] and to die for my sins.
[time=3464] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my life and be my Savior.
[time=3469] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3472] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3476] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3481] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3488] To receive a copy of your decision or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Closer Walk" please write to the Bible Hour
