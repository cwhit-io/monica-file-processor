[time=30] Harrison was the full back of the Dallas Cowboys.
[time=34] He was asked to describe coach Tom Landry.
[time=37] And Garrison kind of folded his arms and thought for a moment.
[time=40] He said, well, coach is kind of-- and he continued to stammer.
[time=44] Well, he's like, well, the way to describe coaches, well-- and then he blurted it out.
[time=49] Well, coach Landry, he's a Christian.
[time=54] If someone was asked to describe your life, what would they say?
[time=59] If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?
[time=65] [MUSIC]
[time=71] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship
[time=82] on the Bible hour.
[time=83] Thank you for joining us.
[time=85] Rick's message today is entitled, a church worth going to.
[time=90] I am not going to church.
[time=92] It is full of hypocrites.
[time=93] I am sure you have heard that accusation tossed around.
[time=96] Unfortunately, it always has a measure of truth to it.
[time=100] Even the best of Christians aren't perfect.
[time=102] Mark Twain said, we are all like the moon.
[time=105] We each have our dark side.
[time=107] But if a fair-minded observer was to look at our lives, would they see that Christ does make a difference?
[time=113] If you were on trial for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?
[time=118] Today, as we study the book of 1 Thessalonians, we will discover how relevant the Bible is.
[time=123] We will meet people who are convicted for being a Christian.
[time=126] I'm sure you will be refreshed by this enlightening and practical study.
[time=131] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Thessalonians.
[time=135] Rick's text is taken from chapter 1, verses 4 through 10.
[time=140] "The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song." Other special music includes a solo from Starr Braddagam and an instrumental solo from Dave Johnson.
[time=155] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=163] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=169] Now, here's Rick.
[time=171] - Same, we wanna welcome you this morning and trust that God will use this hour to strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=178] I enjoy coming into this place, not just because it's new or it's pretty, but because it's a place where we meet and we see one another.
[time=185] We're able to exchange words of encouragement, words of greeting.
[time=189] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=195] We've come here today to worship God because we believe, as the scriptures have taught us, that He is holy and our choir teaches us that truth and their anthem of praise, holy, art thou.
[time=207] [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=429] (audience applauding)
[time=439] - Continue in our worship by singing him number 267.
[time=443] Him number 267, come thou, almighty king.
[time=447] [MUSIC - 43 seconds]
[time=492] (singing in foreign language)
[time=522] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=548] - This morning we've been focusing upon God's holiness and his majesty, but there's another aspect of God that we need to focus on this morning, and that is the intimate love and care that he has for us.
[time=559] Jeremiah 31-3, "Aye, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee." Starr comes to sing for us now a song that focuses upon that intimate love and care that he has for us.
[time=573] (gentle music)
[time=581] [MUSIC - 288 seconds]
[time=884] We're thankful you have joined us again today for the Bible hour.
[time=892] We really are trusting that God will use this hour in your life to strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=899] Or if you're searching to know him that even today you might come to discover that he is your Savior.
[time=905] Thanks for being a part of this ministry for today.
[time=908] Often my friend Peter Koby is with us.
[time=910] He's visiting his son at college this weekend and a good friend of mine and our school administrator Steve Long breaks here.
[time=916] Steve, welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=918] Thanks for having me.
[time=919] Well, we're glad to have you as a part of the television ministry for today.
[time=923] And it's an opportunity to share with you friends in the Greater Fort Wayne area about Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=929] This has been a busy time for the school.
[time=931] The sectional basketball tournament has just ended.
[time=934] The spelling bee has just ended.
[time=936] And there's that ISMA program that I need some education about.
[time=939] What is ISMA and how do we do?
[time=941] ISMA is a state contest sponsored by the Indiana Department of Public Instruction
[time=947] and music people around the state.
[time=949] And they give students an opportunity to compete, not against each other, but just having judges judge them as to their competence in their field in piano, vocal, whatever.
[time=960] And our students that ended up getting a chance to go to state after they did well in the regional all accomplished what they set out for and that is they got ones.
[time=968] We had nine students that went down to Indianapolis and got ones in performance.
[time=973] Well, that's fantastic and I just talked to a man in our church yesterday whose granddaughter was our spelling bee champ.
[time=980] She's a sixth grader and apparently they compete six seventh and eighth graders against each other.
[time=984] That's right.
[time=985] And yesterday she was able to finish second in the county and the spelling bee.
[time=990] That was Debbie Rodenback.
[time=991] I'm really proud of her for that.
[time=993] Rightfully so.
[time=994] When we talk about Christian education often people have the idea that it's a regular school and then we just sneak the Bible in there somewhere along the way.
[time=1003] What is the philosophy of Christian education?
[time=1006] The truth is that we are really committed to sticking to a philosophy that is founded on the Bible.
[time=1014] Teaching our students that perhaps men will have opinions that are contrary to the Bible.
[time=1019] But when that comes about and we see that in textbooks or hear it from some other source, we'll defend the Bible and treat it as truth, as fact and just admit that men make mistakes
[time=1031] and that the Bible is true and everything that we teach needs to be predicated on that fact.
[time=1035] You know when you have a report of a spelling bee, a student doing so well and the ISMA contest going so well, it's obviously you've lived up to the commitment of academic excellence
[time=1046] on a biblical foundation.
[time=1048] How do you integrate the wisdom of man which may have a great deal of truth and then it may have
[time=1054] some merit with the Bible?
[time=1055] How do you integrate that?
[time=1057] You know the Bible is a part of a person's life if they put it into their heart.
[time=1064] And we can't buy books that do that.
[time=1068] We can only hope that our teachers that are really committed to studying the Word and hiding it in their heart are going to be able to then apply it on a daily basis when situations come up in school.
[time=1080] We do buy textbooks that are really founded on the truths of the Word when we can.
[time=1086] But there are many subject areas where people that are Christians really haven't tried to do that.
[time=1091] And so we don't have books available in that case, but it's the teacher in the first place anyhow.
[time=1096] They have to know the Word and they have to live it in order for that to be integrated into a school.
[time=1101] Well Steve, as the father of three students here at Blackhawk Christian, we couldn't be more pleased with both the spiritual emphasis and the academic excellence that our students have
[time=1112] received here.
[time=1113] Thanks.
[time=1114] If our friends have a student or a friend that they would like to get more information about school on their behalf, what should their next move be?
[time=1122] Registration to our school opens to the public on March 13th, and if they'll call our school
[time=1128] at 4937400, we'll be glad to give them information and send it right to them.
[time=1134] Thanks Steve.
[time=1135] Along with inviting you to participate in Blackhawk Christian school, we have two unique services
[time=1141] coming up.
[time=1142] They're not all that unique.
[time=1143] Other churches will do them, but we're particularly excited about these two services.
[time=1147] One is on Good Friday.
[time=1149] We leave our building, although we're thankful for this new sanctuary.
[time=1152] We go to the Grand Wayne Center because it's right in the heart of our town centrally located a part of the business district.
[time=1159] And there over the lunch hour, we have a 30-minute Good Friday service.
[time=1164] In that half hour, we'll have a brief message, a solo, an opportunity to see drama, all built
[time=1170] around the theme of Jesus Christ, dying on the cross, and giving to us the greatest gift.
[time=1176] A forgiveness.
[time=1178] So we hope you'll join us and invite friends on Good Friday to the Grand Wayne community-wide
[time=1184] service at 1215 over the lunch hour.
[time=1188] Then on Easter evening, we'll have a musical cantata at 6 o'clock.
[time=1192] Our choir works just as hard on this as they do the living Christmas tree that thousands of you come to.
[time=1198] It's a celebration of the fact that not only did he die for our sins, but Jesus Christ.
[time=1203] He is alive.
[time=1205] I hope you'll join us for both of those services.
[time=1208] Before we go back to our morning worship service, I want to encourage you to write to us today for an excellent booklet produced by our friends at Walk Through the Bible titled Closer Walk.
[time=1220] Most of us have a more desire than we have discipline when it comes to reading God's Word.
[time=1226] I can't mail you, nor can Steve, send you discipline.
[time=1231] But we can't sell you and give to you a road map.
[time=1234] It's free.
[time=1235] I shouldn't have used the word sell.
[time=1237] It's called Closer Walk and it takes you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1242] It requires from you 10 minutes, 12 minutes a day that will give you the richest dividends you'll ever experience.
[time=1249] So we hope that you'll write.
[time=1251] We'll send you a copy free of Closer Walk so you can begin to have just that a closer walk with God through studying His Word.
[time=1259] If you'd like a copy, write to us today.
[time=1262] Our address is the Bible Hour.
[time=1267] 7,400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1273] 4, 6, 8, 1, 5.
[time=1276] Once again, that is the Bible Hour.
[time=1280] 7,400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1286] 4, 6, 8, 1, 5.
[time=1289] Well, thanks for joining us again today.
[time=1291] As we go back to the Morning Worship Service, we trust that God will use this hour to strengthen your spiritual faith.
[time=1310] [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=1399] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1405] Thank you, David.
[time=1407] That was so well played.
[time=1409] David has a talent, but it's also a gift that he gives back to the Lord as a part of worship and ownership of the life that God's given to me.
[time=1418] And I just want to use this talent for the Lord.
[time=1420] We're thankful for that.
[time=1421] Scott, you always accompany so well.
[time=1423] And we are thankful for music that encourages our hearts and exalts the Lord.
[time=1429] I invite you to bow that we could pray together.
[time=1433] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1437] Look full in His wonderful face.
[time=1441] And the things of this world will grow strangely dim in the light of His glory and His grace.
[time=1451] O Lord Jesus, we meet today in your name.
[time=1455] And we ask you to meet with us.
[time=1457] You've promised that you would be in our hearts and in our meeting.
[time=1463] And we today want to know you more than we want to know a song.
[time=1468] More than we want to know the words of a speaker.
[time=1473] We want to know you.
[time=1475] And so we ask you to speak to hearts today.
[time=1479] May each heart that's here find you molding and shaping.
[time=1485] Father, help us to overcome those perennial problems that keep coming back like the dandelions of the spring.
[time=1494] Help us to deal with our anger and jealousy.
[time=1499] Our resentment and our bitterness.
[time=1504] Help us to know when we have falsely accused.
[time=1509] And help us to know when we've rightfully understood and yet must forgive in both occasions.
[time=1517] Please bring healing to our relationships.
[time=1521] Help men to be understanding of their wives.
[time=1525] Wives to be supportive of their husbands.
[time=1529] Break through the generation gaps.
[time=1532] Help each to feel that the other does care and does understand.
[time=1538] Oh God today, we are war torn in this spiritual battle.
[time=1544] We are weary.
[time=1547] Help us not to faint.
[time=1549] We ask you to take this hour as a gift from us to you, as humble and feeble as it may be at times,
[time=1556] as our way of saying that we love you and we honor you and respect you as our Holy God.
[time=1563] And we ask you to fill us now from your Word, to teach us, to make our lives relevant.
[time=1572] To take what the Word has to say and make it come alive so that in our living,
[time=1578] now we've got an authentic experience with you.
[time=1581] We have an accurate example of how we should live.
[time=1585] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1591] At one point Walt Garrison was the full back of the Dallas Cowboys.
[time=1597] He was being interviewed and asked to describe coach Tom Landry.
[time=1602] It's hard for me to speak highly of the Cowboys because they've undone the Cleveland Browns, my home team a number of times.
[time=1610] But Tom Landry is a fine man.
[time=1612] As Garrison stumbled trying to figure out how do you describe coach Tom Landry, he must have began his sentence a half a dozen times and never finished one.
[time=1621] It went something like this.
[time=1623] Well coach, he's sort of, well no he's more like, well you see coaches and then finally he just said,
[time=1630] well coach Landry, he's a Christian.
[time=1633] Wouldn't that be great if somebody was describing your life and mine and as they tried to capture
[time=1639] your personality, suddenly it just came to them.
[time=1642] What you are is you're a man who follows Jesus Christ.
[time=1648] You're a woman who is so committed to Christ that that's the chief description of your
[time=1654] life.
[time=1655] An old question bears repeating.
[time=1658] If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to secure your conviction?
[time=1669] Another way of asking it is the faith you have in Jesus Christ, so real, so relevant.
[time=1675] It's worked its way out of your religion and into your life.
[time=1681] Is your faith in Jesus Christ relevant?
[time=1685] I'd like us to study some lives today of people who had a relevant faith in Christ.
[time=1691] They had the real thing.
[time=1693] And it's a writing that was penned by a man who was arrested for being a Christian and he was also
[time=1700] convicted on the same charge.
[time=1702] It's 1 Thessalonians chapter 1.
[time=1705] You can find it in the middle of your New Testament if you prefer just to listen.
[time=1710] Fine if you have a Bible I encourage you to study with us though.
[time=1714] 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 1 through 3 Paul introduces us to some real people.
[time=1721] Not fables, not fictitious characters, real people.
[time=1726] Real churches, a real city with some real problems.
[time=1731] And then in verses 4 through 70 tells us how relevant their lives were.
[time=1736] 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 4.
[time=1739] Brothers, loved by God, we know that he has chosen you because our gospel came to you
[time=1747] not simply with words but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction.
[time=1758] You know how we lived among you for your sake.
[time=1763] You became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[time=1768] In spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
[time=1776] And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and to Okia.
[time=1782] Here the Apostle Paul begins to talk about them, the real people that they were and their testimony.
[time=1790] What they were known as, they were known as authentic, genuine Christians.
[time=1797] If you like a little outline this morning, here he is going to describe that they had an authentic experience with Christ and they became an accurate example of Christ.
[time=1808] That authentic experience.
[time=1810] He said, "Beloved, we know that you have been chosen by God." No greater thought of refreshment can be that today God actually loves you.
[time=1821] In the midst of all your frustrations in life, of all your disappointments with your home,
[time=1827] with your job, with your church today to know that there is one who never changes
[time=1833] and he says, "I love you" and he calls you his very own "beloved."
[time=1839] You know in the Old Testament that word was used but it was used very sparingly.
[time=1843] It was used in Moses, used in Solomon but not of the general masses but here God says to all of us,
[time=1850] "Beloved, I love you." And Paul says, "We know that he loves you because we know that you've been chosen by him."
[time=1861] Now when we come to that phrase, "You've been chosen," that sends off theological alarms in many heads.
[time=1868] Oh, I remember that word "chosen" and some translations they called "election." And I don't know about this doctrine of election that God before the world was ever formed.
[time=1877] He said, "I'll choose this one and I'll choose that one on this side of the globe." And it sounds like, "I don't have any choice. I don't have any free will." Well that's not exactly the case.
[time=1890] There have been those who have overemphasized this doctrine of God choosing and those who have under emphasized it as well.
[time=1897] There have been those who have overemphasized the fact that as humans we have choice.
[time=1903] There have been those who have under emphasized that as well.
[time=1907] In theological circles you can divide it into two groups.
[time=1910] One has claimed as their hero a guy by the name of John Calvin.
[time=1915] If you've ever been in a good Presbyterian church, you'll hear that name often.
[time=1919] John Calvin was a reformer. He loved the Lord. He was a godly man.
[time=1924] His view of God was of a God that was so sovereign that he literally controlled everything.
[time=1931] Someone has said you can boil Calvin's teaching down into five points.
[time=1936] And if you can remember the little flower tulip, you'll remember Calvin's teachings because it begins T-U-L-I-P.
[time=1942] T stands for the fact that as human beings we are totally sinful.
[time=1948] U stands for the fact that God unconditionally chooses us.
[time=1953] L stands for the teaching that Christ died, but it was just going to be for those who would eventually believe. So it was a limited death or atonement.
[time=1963] Now I have to think T-U-L-I stands for that God's grace is irresistible.
[time=1971] P stands for the fact that he will make sure that the saints, those who believe in impersevere,
[time=1978] that will never get lost, that will never fall out of his grace, that if we come to Christ we'll persevere, we'll never lose that salvation. God will always love us.
[time=1988] But there are those that teach a slight different view and they're godly people too.
[time=1994] They don't put quite as much emphasis on the sovereignty of God.
[time=1997] They put it more on whether you choose, whether you follow, whether you can lose your salvation or not.
[time=2004] Now the critics of this group said they too have a flower.
[time=2007] Calvin had a tulip and the critics of this view said they have a daisy.
[time=2011] It doesn't go da. It goes, "He loves me. He loves me not. God loves me. God loves me not."
[time=2017] Now that's an unfair analogy, but the emphasis is that maybe you could be lost once you've already come to Christ.
[time=2026] Well what do we mean by the fact that God has chosen us?
[time=2031] Well to put it in simple terms, I prefer to look at it this way.
[time=2035] It's simply saying that I had a free will to choose God, but he loved me so much he chose me first.
[time=2043] You know in our dating and courtship relationships, one of the most awkward things, particularly about the junior high years, is to let it be known to that other person that you like them.
[time=2056] That's too risky. That's very insecure.
[time=2059] So when you're 14 years old, you usually don't walk up to a girl and say, "Hi, I saw you in class and I really think you're a nice person and kind of cute." If you like to go to the football game, you don't do that.
[time=2070] You don't want to be at risk.
[time=2073] So what you do is you tell your friend.
[time=2078] I kind of like her.
[time=2081] But your friend doesn't even go to her. That's too risky.
[time=2084] Your friend goes to her friend and says, "My friend kind of likes your friend." And her friend goes to her and says, "My friend's friend kind of likes you.
[time=2094] Do you like my friend's friend?" And if she says yes, her friend comes back to your friend and says, "My friend says she likes your friend." And then he goes back and says, "My friend said that the one you like kind of likes you."
[time=2110] I mean, we're not very secure about being small and saying, "I like you."
[time=2116] And even after that whole thing's gone through, do you think we go to them face to face and say, "I like you. Do you like me?" We write a little note.
[time=2127] You've written these notes, haven't you?
[time=2130] Goes like this, "I like you. Do you like me?"
[time=2136] Then there's a box.
[time=2139] It says yes under the box.
[time=2141] There's no little box and it's real small.
[time=2144] It says no.
[time=2146] Then you sign your name and then you put a PS. Don't say maybe.
[time=2152] I mean, we are so fearful of rejection.
[time=2155] We never even take a hand in that note.
[time=2158] We find out which locker's theirs.
[time=2161] We fold that little note out and then we stick it in the slot.
[time=2165] You know, every locker has to have slots because you have gym stuff in there and there's got to escape.
[time=2170] And you push it through the slot and then you wait for the day that they find that note and they check it and send it back.
[time=2180] Relationships are hard.
[time=2182] We don't want to be the first one to say, "I like you and I'll risk it all." There's a guy who said, "I love you and I'm going to risk it all.
[time=2192] I'm going to tell you that I love you before you ever knew I was there.
[time=2196] I'm going to work in your life before you ever paid one minute of attention to me.
[time=2201] I'm going to so arrange the circumstances of your life so we're going to bump in each other every chance I get.
[time=2208] Oh, I can remember living at Taylor University and the dorm I lived in was the greatest dorm in the world for one reason.
[time=2216] Every student had to pass under my fourth floor room to get into the cafeteria.
[time=2223] And so you could time it. I'd kind of like to meet her.
[time=2225] So you just wait. You see him coming across campus and we knew that it took 28 seconds to run down the stairs and hit the lobby.
[time=2232] And you could just time it so you just happen to bump into people.
[time=2236] And God says, "I know your walk. I know what time you show up at the cafeteria.
[time=2240] I know a time you go to work and I'm just going to keep bumping into you so you'll know that I love you and I've chosen you and I care about you."
[time=2247] And in all of our courtships, we're afraid to be the one that says, "I love you and God says, "I love you and I choose you."
[time=2255] Have you ever wanted to be chosen in life?
[time=2259] I have a congenital condition. It's something I was born with. It's not terminal. It's just called being short.
[time=2268] And when you're not quite five-nine, you don't have much prospect of getting taller at age 36.
[time=2276] And that was something I grew up with and I love to play basketball.
[time=2280] When you go to basketball courts, the big guys dominate it. It's time to pick up a game and the two big guys always get the pick.
[time=2287] He gets first pick, then he gets the next two. And all the guys are standing there. And they do things like this.
[time=2293] You know, "I'll talk and I make myself." And you stand there and you'll wait.
[time=2298] And the last guy says, "Well, I'll take him." He says, "Well, then I get those two." All right, then I want him.
[time=2305] And each guy stands there saying, "Somebody going to choose me? Does anybody want me on their team?
[time=2312] Am I acceptable in this group?" God says, "You're acceptable to me. I love you. I'll choose you."
[time=2322] And whatever the doctrinal election may do to trouble your heart, would you know that it's God's way of simply saying, "I love you so much. I couldn't wait for you to find out whether you love me." So I just went ahead and chose you.
[time=2336] That's what it means. And these people had an authentic experience with God because he had chosen them.
[time=2343] And now Paul spills out four evidences of that in the next verses. He says, "We know God has chosen you because."
[time=2350] How do we know that God's chosen you? Because reason number one, they weren't won by human words.
[time=2357] He says this, "Because our gospel came to you not simply with words."
[time=2364] What Paul was saying there is there are those people who are so persuasive.
[time=2370] They have the ability to sell us things we don't even want.
[time=2375] We answered the telephone one night. Years ago, the caller said, "If you can answer this question right, you will win."
[time=2384] And we answered the question wrong. And we still won.
[time=2388] We won our own free eight millimeter super duper deluxe home camera.
[time=2397] This was the days before videotape recorders and all that. And not only did we win the camera, we won the projector and the screen.
[time=2407] It's fantastic. When can the salesmen bring it over? So weeks signed up and you tomorrow? How soon can he come?
[time=2416] And as he told us about all these free things we won, we only had to do one thing, agree to buy all of our film and development service from them.
[time=2425] He sounded great to us. He said, "How many rolls of film do you think you'll need?" And I calculated that we'd probably need at least two a year. He didn't like that answer.
[time=2435] He said, "Well, wouldn't you use one at this birthday and that anniversary and this event?" By the time it was done, we needed $835 worth of film and development service each year.
[time=2447] Now, we were young and naive and we said, "Oh, okay." And we signed up and we bought the whole farm.
[time=2454] Next morning, Kathy and I got up and looked at each other and said, "What did we do?" I mean, you know, we don't even develop pictures out of our regular camera. We got rolls of stuff and they're $835.
[time=2468] We realized that somebody just had said all the right things and all the right ways and a bunch of newly wedges went, "Oh, great. I'll take it."
[time=2478] It was human words. And, you know, tragically, the same thing can happen out of a pulpit.
[time=2485] Somebody can be so persuasive. They can be so eloquent that you say, "Well, I'll take Jesus and I'll take two passes to the next show, too. What's going on? I'll buy."
[time=2495] And Paul said, "Your faith in Jesus Christ was not simply produced out of human words.
[time=2502] It wasn't the Jim Jones effect that somebody could mesmerize a crowd and talk them into following."
[time=2510] He put it so clearly in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 in an elaboration of this, not 13, 1 Corinthians chapter 2, excuse me.
[time=2520] Balancing out that it's not human words. When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquent speech or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
[time=2532] For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[time=2538] I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling.
[time=2542] My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power, so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power.
[time=2557] Paul said, "I didn't come to you and say, 'Listen to this and try to wow them with this speech.' Their faith was built on something more than just human persuasiveness."
[time=2569] The second reason they know their faith is genuine because it says it came to you with power.
[time=2577] It is not physical power. It is not emotional power. It's not supernatural power of miracles.
[time=2584] It is the power of God's Word when it hits our heart.
[time=2590] God's Word may at points be poetic and at other points be historic, but it is like no other book. It is like no other writing because it has spiritual power.
[time=2604] Let me illustrate what happened in my life. I went to a church camp and there I heard David Burnham speak. David is a great communicator.
[time=2613] But as he spoke, I thought for sure that my mother had called him.
[time=2619] He said, "My little boy Ricky is going to be at this camp and he does this and he does this and he did that." Because every time that man spoke, he was reading my mail and I was flabbergasted to discover that he didn't even know who I was.
[time=2635] I was relieved to know that my mother had not called him.
[time=2639] The point of it all was this, that God's Word has a power to penetrate our hearts, speak to the inner person when the inner person says, "I don't even want to hear."
[time=2650] And it has the ability to make us sense this is real and I need Christ and there is a power to his message.
[time=2660] I remember speaking as a youth pastor when I went to school in California and we had a group of men share their testimonies.
[time=2667] This man took the hour and shared his testimony. This high school guy accepted Christ because he had a problem.
[time=2673] And his problem in this guy's testimony had nothing in common but there was power in the presentation of God's Word.
[time=2682] Have you experienced that power?
[time=2685] Maybe it's been known to you that at the time when we end our service with an invitation that you feel very uncomfortable.
[time=2692] God's saying, "I want you." Maybe you've been around friends and they're Christians and you're uncomfortable because they keep talking about God in such a way you say, "That's not real to me."
[time=2704] And you're saying there must be some power that they don't seem to be able to identify but they've got it.
[time=2712] Paul said, "Our message came to you with power and you heard it and it prompted your heart to act."
[time=2719] The third proof he says it came not only with power but with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2724] When you come to Christ you receive the Holy Spirit.
[time=2730] That's God himself and he does a whole number of things. Let me just give you a tip of the iceberg.
[time=2738] The first thing the Holy Spirit does when you come to Christ in biblical words is he indwells you.
[time=2744] He actually lives inside of you. The moment you ask Jesus Christ to come into your heart by his spirit, he actually moves in.
[time=2753] He lives there and a spirit of God is resident in each of your hearts.
[time=2760] And the good news is he said, "Not only did I come but I'll never leave you.
[time=2765] I'm with you always. His eye is on the sparrow and I know he watches me."
[time=2771] He not only indwells us but the Bible says he seals us.
[time=2775] Now that's not a type of superglue bonding. It means that he puts his mark on us.
[time=2780] In those days if the emperor sealed something it meant that he put his mark on it
[time=2786] and when you got a document that was marked with the emperor's seal you said, "This is important. This belongs to him." When God seals us he says, "I put my mark on you and I've got you numbered and named and you belong to me."
[time=2806] Another thing the Holy Spirit does is he baptizes us. You say, "Wait a minute. I don't remember getting wet the day I asked Jesus in my heart."
[time=2814] Well there's a baptism that's different than water baptism.
[time=2818] If you're baptized somebody takes you and they place you into water. That's what the word "bapto" means. It means to dip.
[time=2825] And when the Bible talks about the Holy Spirit baptizing us it means that the Holy Spirit takes you the moment you accept Christ
[time=2832] and he picks you up and instead of placing you in water he places you into what we call the family of God.
[time=2838] You belong to Christ. You're part of his extension, his body, and he puts you there and he's picked you on his basketball team regardless of how short or how tall you are.
[time=2851] The final thing that it says because it came to us with deep conviction there may be a place for casual Christianity but I have not found it.
[time=2865] When we come to Christ it is to be not just, oh if that's all it means sure I'll do that.
[time=2872] Sometimes we present the gospel too softly, too easily, and we need to come to Christ with deep conviction that says,
[time=2879] "I am giving my life to Christ. I'm not just buying a premium paid life insurance policy that keeps me out of hell.
[time=2888] I'm actually taking the title of my life and I'm giving it over to him."
[time=2894] There was a will and it included not only the things that you bought you owned and you purchased but it had a place where you signed over your life.
[time=2904] Whose name is at the bottom? Yours are Jesus Christ.
[time=2909] These people were authentic. They had come to Christ and they had come wholeheartedly no compromise.
[time=2916] By 1865 the Civil War had ravaged the North and the South alike.
[time=2924] The South had demonstrated significant victory in battle and superior military strategy but they overwhelmed by the North with its industrial power.
[time=2934] Its ability to produce more supplies its population advantage and it came a point when Lee knew that he had to surrender.
[time=2944] And so he sent a courier to Grant and he asked what the terms of surrender might be and Grant responded with two words, unconditional surrender.
[time=2957] And when we come to Christ he asks us to come and when we want to negotiate he says, "Come with deep convictions, unconditional surrender."
[time=2968] These people were real. They had been bitten by the real bug. Their faith was relevant because they had an authentic experience.
[time=2977] But their own experience went beyond that. They actually became themselves an accurate example of a believer.
[time=2985] Come to the middle of verse 5 Paul says, "You know what manner of people we were. We actually lived among you."
[time=2993] One of the greatest tests of Christianity is not what do the people who see you from a distance think but what do the people who see you close up think.
[time=3003] You're familiar with those famous words, "Dr. Livingston, I presume."
[time=3010] Livingston had left England. He had served as a missionary in the heart of Africa. He had given his life there.
[time=3017] No one had heard from him in years. Stanley, the skeptic, the man who described himself as a devout atheist went in search of the famous Dr. Livingston.
[time=3028] He searched the continent I think for two years before he found him. And when he found him he was rather easy to identify.
[time=3035] He was the only white man in that part of the jungle. And he said, "Dr. Livingston, I presume."
[time=3041] The two met and Stanley stayed on and watched and wondered. And after his stay, living with Livingston, Stanley records in his diary that this devout atheist became a believer in Jesus Christ because he saw it.
[time=3059] It was lived out. Here Paul says, "You know what manner of men we were that we lived among you. And you began to imitate us."
[time=3070] The very best way that you can teach somebody is to show them. The telling is fine, the lecture is fine, but can you show them?
[time=3081] How do you really do that? Paul said, "We lived among you and we showed you how to live so that you could actually copy us."
[time=3092] You know, lots of us not only learn better by being shown, but we're a little bit stubborn and we have to be shown.
[time=3098] Benjamin Franklin, the great American inventor, had discovered that if you put plaster in the soil, plants grew better.
[time=3105] Now try to sell that to some 18th century farmers, will you?
[time=3109] Hey guys, you know the plaster you put in your homes, throw it out in your field and your plants will grow better.
[time=3114] Sure, Franklin.
[time=3115] No one would believe him. So Franklin took a piece of property right along the main side of a road and he scratched a certain pattern into the earth and put plaster in that pattern and then sowed seed all over the whole field.
[time=3132] And as things grew, most of the things grew about this high and then others of it grew significantly higher. The pattern that he had scratched in plaster were not actually a design, but it was words.
[time=3145] And he had scrolled these words. This part of the field was sown in plaster.
[time=3151] Every farmer who went by was suddenly convinced that putting plaster in your fields would help.
[time=3159] They couldn't take it. Word of mouth. They had to be shown.
[time=3164] You know, in our Christian life, a lot of things, we hear a word of mouth, but wouldn't it be great if somebody would show us?
[time=3169] If somebody would illustrate it, if somebody would actually live that out in front of us.
[time=3174] I've told you this before, I love this story, so it bears repeating for my sake, even if you don't like it.
[time=3180] But a study was done on behavior with a little goose.
[time=3185] If you take a little goose, the moment it's born, keep it around its mother, it will learn to behave by following its mother and it will act just like a goose.
[time=3194] But if you take a goose egg and hatch it apart from its mother, don't let it ever see another goose and take an elastic string and put a ball at the end of it and keep it bouncing on the elastic.
[time=3208] If that's the only thing the goose will ever see, the goose will think that what it is is a bouncing ball and the poor little goose for the rest of its life will go like this.
[time=3218] You put it with other geese, it won't know what to do because they learn by copying. They learn by imitating.
[time=3227] A month ago, we purchased a dog. I don't know what's in the mind of that little dog, but I'm convinced it thinks it's a person already.
[time=3236] Because it lives around people and it gets treated as well as the people do.
[time=3241] We learn by what's around us and what we copy. Paul said, "I stayed around you so that you could copy."
[time=3248] And it's important that we have others that we can look up to, that we can model, that we can copy.
[time=3256] But we've got to do more than just copy. Paul said, "You not only copied us, but he traced it back." He said, "And you copied the Lord also."
[time=3267] Every Christian has some strengths and every Christian has some weaknesses.
[time=3273] And if you pick one out, you'll say, "I'll follow that woman because she's godly." You'll be disappointed because they'll also have, as Mark Twain would say, their dark side.
[time=3283] But Paul, don't be discouraged. Don't give up. Just say they're a Christian and I can learn what good they have from them and when they're not so good, I'll learn that too.
[time=3294] And then go one step further and say, "I've got to copy the Lord." Wouldn't it be great to be Peter and say, "Yeah, I lived with him for three years." Wouldn't it be great to be Thomas and say, "Yeah, I saw him. I touched him."
[time=3307] You and I don't have that privilege, but we have the privilege of meeting him in the pages of the Word of God.
[time=3313] And as we study the Word of God, we meet a Jesus who's real and relevant, authentic, and we can know him.
[time=3321] There's an ancient tablet that's been discovered. It was a student's tablet.
[time=3325] As the teacher taught the student to write, the teacher would write across the top of the page, then the student was to rewrite it again and again on the page
[time=3335] by looking at the teacher's writing. It's obvious from the document, though, that this student failed to keep the instructions.
[time=3343] Here was the teacher's writing and the student copied it and their copy wasn't as good.
[time=3348] When the student copied it again, instead of copying the teachers, they copied their copy.
[time=3354] So the next one was even less and the next one copied that one and by the time you got to the bottom of the page, it was terrible
[time=3362] because it had gotten too far from the original. It's good to copy other Christians.
[time=3367] We're supposed to imitate those who are godly, but we've got to get back to the original.
[time=3372] You've got to be in the Word. You've got to know the Christ of Scriptures.
[time=3378] Put well by any Johnston Flint.
[time=3382] Christ has no hands but our hands to do His work today. He has no feet but our feet to lead men in the way.
[time=3390] He has no tongue but our tongue to tell men how He died.
[time=3394] He has no help but our help to bring them to His side.
[time=3398] We are the only Bible that careless world will read.
[time=3402] We are the sinner's gospel. We are the scoffers' creed.
[time=3408] We are the last message given in word and deed.
[time=3412] What if the type is crooked? What if the print is blurred?
[time=3416] What if our hands are busy with other work than His?
[time=3419] What if our feet are walking where sin and allurement is?
[time=3423] What if our tongue is speaking of things His lips would spurn?
[time=3427] How can we hope to help Him or to welcome His return?
[time=3432] Again, we want to thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
