[time=121] - At age 11, John Newton went to sea following in the footsteps of his English father.
[time=128] He soon worked his way up to the very position of captain as a young man.
[time=133] He found that slave trafficking was the most profitable adventurer at sea.
[time=138] And he went into a downward spiral of evil until fate turned on him and he himself became a slave in Africa.
[time=148] Later, as a captain set free again, he was again immersed in that evil practice.
[time=155] He found that he needed God, that he needed his life changed, and he gave his heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=163] He was radically transformed and radically changed.
[time=167] Later, he wrote these words.
[time=170] Amazing grace.
[time=172] How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=176] I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[time=180] Was blind, but now I see.
[time=184] (dramatic music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=200] Thank you for joining us.
[time=202] Rick's message today is entitled, Christianity.
[time=206] The dramatic conversion of John Newton illustrates God's promise that he will accept and forgive anyone who will come to him.
[time=212] Newton's transformation was radical.
[time=214] His life was changed completely.
[time=216] As we examine the Bible in today's message, we will see the radical Christianity at work.
[time=222] 1 Thessalonians 1 is the passage which we will study.
[time=225] Here we get a glimpse of Christianity that is contagious and radical.
[time=229] We encourage you to open your Bibles to the book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=233] Our text is taken from chapter 1 verses 8 through 10.
[time=237] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=241] Other special music includes a solo from Ed Richard and a selection from celebration.
[time=249] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=257] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=261] Now, here's Rick.
[time=264] We're glad that you're here.
[time=266] We're thankful that you've come to this place that we can worship the Lord together.
[time=270] We want to welcome you friends and also our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=275] We've come the day to celebrate, to worship, because God has given us a faith and a faith that is built upon a solid rock and the rock of our faith is Jesus.
[time=291] [MUSIC]
[time=301] The rock of faith is Jesus and of His rock we stand.
[time=306] His name is like a tower, raised high above the land.
[time=311] And when we are in danger, we roll over to Heaven.
[time=316] The grace that keeps our spirits of each other's hearts are mine.
[time=321] Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord Jesus!
[time=327] [MUSIC]
[time=331] The rock of faith is Jesus and in His rock we stand.
[time=336] His heart is brought to sin and to be cursed.
[time=340] [MUSIC]
[time=353] Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord Jesus!
[time=360] [MUSIC]
[time=367] The rock of faith is Jesus and of His rock we stand.
[time=462] [MUSIC]
[time=473] Certainly the love we have for the Lord ought to be reflected in our praise to Him.
[time=478] It's wonderful to lean on the arms of Jesus Christ and to rest in the promises that He will help us in time of need.
[time=485] What a fellowship and what a joy divine it is to lean on the everlasting arms of Jesus.
[time=490] One hundred fifty-four.
[time=492] We'll sing all three stanzas together of three hundred fifty-four.
[time=496] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=632] Thank you very much for your good singing. We do appreciate it when you join with us as we worship the Lord together in this way.
[time=639] To remind you there will be good music in our sanctuary tonight as we host the college chorale from Grand Rapids Baptist College in seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[time=649] Please make it a point to come at six o'clock and join in in this hour of beautiful music from their touring chorale.
[time=656] We listen now to our special music. As had Richard comes to minister to us, let's listen to his message.
[time=662] [MUSIC]
[time=684] I thought that I was clever. I thought it was so wise. Surely you could never see inside this darkness.
[time=699] I thought that I had fooled you. Now I see I was the fool thinking that I could hide this darkness in my heart.
[time=719] So wash me long. In your presence wash me set me free.
[time=736] There's a stain in my heart that only you can see.
[time=748] Wash me make me clean.
[time=758] [MUSIC]
[time=771] I brought you sacrifices. My silver in my gold. In my selfishness I tried to buy your pleasures.
[time=788] But your holiness requires the offering you desire is that I bring to you a broken combo heart.
[time=807] And you'll wash me Lord. In your presence wash me make me clean.
[time=824] There's a stain in my heart that only you can see.
[time=834] [MUSIC]
[time=838] So break me Lord. In your presence wash me make me clean.
[time=856] There's a stain in my heart that only you can see.
[time=867] Wash me make me clean.
[time=882] [MUSIC]
[time=898] Hello again. We've taken these few moments away from our morning worship service.
[time=904] So Peter and I could have just a moment to talk with you friends.
[time=907] These are exciting days as we anticipate Easter.
[time=911] Rick it's always a great time to celebrate the resurrection of our Savior.
[time=915] And it's delightful to go away from our building and be in a more convenient place downtown.
[time=920] So some of the people that can work and get together with us on Good Friday.
[time=924] Well we're looking forward to that and want to invite you to our Good Friday service at the Grand Wayne on March the 24th.
[time=932] It's a brief service because we are trying to make it a possibility for those of you who have to make your Good Friday worship a part of your lunch hour.
[time=940] Maybe your office or your factory or your place of employment doesn't shut down.
[time=945] Well you can join us at 1215 to 1245 over the lunch hour on March the 24th for Good Friday.
[time=953] In that half hour we're going to pack in a brief message, some powerful music and drama that will help us to focus our attention on Jesus Christ.
[time=962] We want to invite you, your friends, your colleagues at work or in your neighborhood to join us on March the 24th.
[time=968] And then we also want to encourage you to come on the evening of Easter for our special Easter musical.
[time=974] Rick we're going to focus in on the cross and Calvary, entitled our musical at Calvary.
[time=980] We'll be doing some mighty powerful songs, some of which are Almighty God.
[time=986] In Majesty he will come and the great song and can it be.
[time=990] In fact I think that's one of your favorite songs.
[time=992] There'll be some soloists and then there'll be some monologues depicting some of the relationships that Jesus had with biblical characters and their relationship together.
[time=1002] I think it's going to be an inspiring time again as we celebrate the resurrection of Christ around the cross.
[time=1008] Well that'll be great and we do want to include you so we're taking these days to alert you that those opportunities are coming.
[time=1016] Last week Steve Longbrake was here with us and he mentioned the opportunity to enroll students in Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=1024] And I just wanted to remind you of that opportunity and encourage you if you're interested in Christian education that you can call our school office
[time=1032] Monday through Friday between 8 and 4 in the afternoon and the number is 4937400.
[time=1041] Once again our phone number is 4937400 but please do call on Monday through Friday between 8 and 4 in the daytime hours.
[time=1051] Finally before we return to our church service we want to encourage you to have the habit of consistently regularly walking with God through a personal Bible study.
[time=1062] So we have a booklet for you entitled "Closer Walk." This will guide you in a reading schedule taking you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1073] If you're like me and I sense many of you are you have some great great desires but not as great a follow through.
[time=1081] A lot of good ambition and starts but not always as great a finish.
[time=1086] This booklet will help you to structure your life so that at the end of the year you'll be able to say "I've read the entire New Testament."
[time=1094] And yet it's a daily bite, it's not a big gulp, it's not an overwhelming amount.
[time=1099] Usually about 5 to 10-12 minutes a day will get you through that day's reading.
[time=1105] We'll refresh you spiritually and help you to walk closer with God and we'd like to send you a copy so you can get started right away.
[time=1112] We'd like to encourage you to write today for the pamphlet entitled "Closer Walk." You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1127] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1136] Thank you Peter and thank you for joining us again here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1166] [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=1333] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1342] Thank you celebration, that was certainly a joyful song and that is the topic of our memory verse for the month of March.
[time=1348] I'd like to ask you to join me now in standing as we recite the memory verse for the month of March.
[time=1354] First Thessalonians 5 verse 16 through 18. Be joyful always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[time=1374] First Thessalonians 5, 16 through 18. Thank you, you may be seated.
[time=1380] Thank you Dale and I'm thankful that you're making it a priority of your life to memorize God's Word.
[time=1388] David said, "How shall a young man keep his way pure by taking heed according to your word?"
[time=1395] Then he said, "Thy word have I hid in my heart so that I might not sin against you."
[time=1401] God's Word is a form of spiritual power and if we have it in our life, it will energize us from the inside and charge us and give us the power we need for Christian living.
[time=1414] I'd like to invite you to now pray with me.
[time=1417] God I ask you to charge us today to electrify us with enthusiasm, not just for an hour of worship, not just to pick up our spirits through a song,
[time=1428] but you put a spirit within us through the power of your word that gives us the power to drive through every circumstance giving you thanks.
[time=1439] We would pray today that your spirit would enable us to conquer the most difficult of obstacles.
[time=1447] We thank you for the miraculous recovery in Gerald Swanson's body, racked by stroke but restored by you in your hand. Thank you for the fine doctors and hospitals that have provided such excellent care.
[time=1462] We pray today that you would comfort those who are battling for their health.
[time=1467] For Linda Hatfield, as she goes through chronic trouble with her heart, for Julie, as she battles with cancer, for those who are fighting discouragement.
[time=1478] God we would ask you today to charge us with a spirit that keeps us going.
[time=1484] We pray for those who are bored with life, with their job, with their work, perhaps with their family.
[time=1493] They need refreshment, the whole world can't change, so Lord we're praying change me, electrify me, give me a dynamic for living that is missing.
[time=1508] If there are those that don't know Christ, help them today to see that they need Him.
[time=1513] If they do know Christ, help them to lean and to trust on His power and to be refreshed.
[time=1519] Help us to throw off the chains of the old and grab hold of the new, in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1530] At age 11, John Newton followed his father's footsteps.
[time=1535] They led him to the sea and to become a sailor.
[time=1538] In a relatively short period of time, he rose in the ranks and actually became the captain of his own ship.
[time=1545] In the 1700s, if a sea captain wanted to make money, the real money was to be found in slave trade.
[time=1552] So John Newton entered the detestable practice of capturing Africans in their continent and then shipping them as slaves to both his home country of England and her colonies of America.
[time=1566] His life was a downward spiral of evil until the parody of life and its irony found him as a slave himself in Africa.
[time=1578] He later escaped, having failed to learn any lessons he returned to the practice of slave trading.
[time=1586] This continued till his ship was battered and beaten in a three-day storm.
[time=1592] Some of his crew were swept off the deck to their death, and he remained with a skeleton crew,
[time=1601] bailing for their lives, fighting the storm, and in the midst of that storm, John Newton found himself asking a question he had never considered before.
[time=1611] Would God's mercy extend to even him?
[time=1616] He made it through that storm, and that question plugged him in the weeks ahead. Would God have mercy on him?
[time=1625] John Newton then discovered in the pages of the scripture that Jesus Christ loved, even a slave trader, even a vile John Newton.
[time=1635] And the most strong of infidels became a believer. The most unlikely of candidates, John Newton became a pastor.
[time=1645] And the most surprising of men became a songwriter, and John Newton penned these words. Amazing grace.
[time=1654] How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see.
[time=1665] Jesus Christ is able to radically, dramatically change lives.
[time=1673] If you have a Bible with you, I invite you to explore this concept of radical Christianity with me out of 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 and verses 8-10.
[time=1684] I use the word radically with a great deal of reservation. If you're a mathematician, you know that the radical is the square root of the number under consideration.
[time=1694] If you grew up like I did in the 60s, a radical are the people on the extreme left, which I typically disassociate myself from.
[time=1702] If you use the word radical today, it's really pronounced rad. It comes out of the north valley of Los Angeles, and it's a whole subculture that none of us understand.
[time=1711] But something that's radical is something that gets back to the root, back to the basics. And in 1 Thessalonians, we meet one of the earliest churches in the whole western world.
[time=1723] And we discover a contagious Christianity that's unlike most of us have ever experienced because it was so rooted, so radical, so powerful.
[time=1733] 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 8, "The Lord's message rang out from you, and not only in Macedonia and Achaia, your faith in God has become known everywhere.
[time=1748] Therefore we do not need to say anything about it, for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us.
[time=1757] They tell how you turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath."
[time=1773] I find this passage to describe a church that we've already looked at, how real they were and how relevant they were, but I also found them to be refreshingly radical.
[time=1786] They were radical in these three ways, they were radically charged, they were radically changed, and they were radically committed, and I want to be like them.
[time=1798] First of all, they were radically charged, this is a church that got electrified and personified and charged them with spiritual power.
[time=1808] In verse 8 it says, "The Lord's message rang out from you."
[time=1815] The word rang out is used a lot of different ways, one of the ways it's used in English of course is to picture a big powerful bell, maybe like the Liberty Bell, that when it rings it sounds for the signal.
[time=1829] These people didn't use bells though, when they rang out they rang out on a trumpet, and this imagery here perhaps is the imagery of the boy you're going into battle and a makeshift trumpet was used, and it would blow a strong and powerful sound
[time=1844] that would go above the hoof-beat of horses, above the thundering of infantrymen, above the clanging of military gear against each other, they'd hear a trumpet, and that trumpet would ring out the sound of a charge.
[time=1858] Paul says, "Your life in Jesus Christ was so rooted, it was so radical that it was sounded out like a trumpet."
[time=1868] Other ways that this is used is that of the thundering of the clouds.
[time=1873] The Greeks believe that when the thunder of the clouds took place, Zeus was on his throne and about to speak.
[time=1882] We make the same mistake, we often talk about God's voice being the thunder.
[time=1887] Our kindergarten teacher in the Sunday school room spoke that way, and one little boy was just four years old, brilliant, but he stuttered,
[time=1896] and when the teacher said, "Don't be afraid of the thunder, it's just God," he said, "No, it's when the hot air hits the cold air."
[time=1905] We got a science lesson out of a fourth grader, that's not God's voice, but when you hear that thunder, it gets your attention.
[time=1914] It's as though God was speaking, and when here it uses that word thunder, one of the imagery of the Greek language,
[time=1922] it's like all of heaven is thundering to command the attention of the world.
[time=1929] This church rang out the message of faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1934] Paul said, "You heard about it up there in northern Greece.
[time=1937] Then we heard it down in southern Greece, in Corinth and in Sparta.
[time=1941] Then we've heard about it everywhere in the world." This is an infant church.
[time=1947] They didn't have television. They didn't have a living Christmas tree or a patriotic panorama.
[time=1952] They didn't have a microphone, but their faith in Jesus Christ was so crystal clear.
[time=1957] It was so rooted, it was so radical, that literally the world knew that Jesus Christ had come to Thessalonica.
[time=1967] Uniquely situated on the globe, the Roman Empire encompassed the southern half of the islands of Britain,
[time=1976] all of the continent of Europe and what we know of the Middle East today and the northern shore of Africa.
[time=1984] Almost in the geographical center of all that is the city of Thessalonica.
[time=1990] There was a road that went across Europe called the Ignatian Way.
[time=1996] That road was joined by a road that went from the Ignatian Way south through the Greek island country and its Peloponnesus.
[time=2005] It went from Thessalonica to Marathon to Athens to Corinth to Sparta.
[time=2012] Those roads met was the city of Thessalonica.
[time=2016] It was a seaco city and literally the world came in and out of Thessalonica.
[time=2021] When they came through, they heard, "Did you hear about that new group?
[time=2025] Did you hear about this one named Jesus Christ?" There are some lives that have been radically transformed.
[time=2032] These people are charged and we haven't stopped hearing about Jesus Christ.
[time=2038] There are people in every generation who are so committed to Jesus Christ.
[time=2043] It's alike they have been electrified by God Himself.
[time=2048] Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, they stood before a pagan king.
[time=2053] The pagan king said, "You'll either worship Me as Lord and God, or I'll throw you into the fiery furnace." And in the gracious way they said, "Throw us in the fiery furnace." They were so charged, they said, "We will refuse to worship or speak in any other name."
[time=2069] They were that charged.
[time=2071] Esther was sent in to do what was against the law of the Persians.
[time=2075] She was told she would die and she said, "I'm charged." If I die, I die.
[time=2084] Jeremiah the prophet had been ridiculed.
[time=2088] Everywhere he went, he would say, "The terror of the Lord is coming." And so whenever Jeremiah showed up, there would be those who had taught him.
[time=2095] And they'd call him Magom is a beeb, Hebrew for terror on every side.
[time=2100] Jeremiah started to lose his charge and he started to lose his enthusiasm.
[time=2104] He said, "Within his own heart, I'm not going to speak anymore in the Lord's name." Then he said, "His fire was in me." And his word was within me and it burned within me and I couldn't do anything but speak in his name.
[time=2120] He was charged.
[time=2123] In the history of my hometown of Akron, Ohio, there was a little man who was charged by Jesus Christ.
[time=2130] Small of stature, fumbling in his use of English, Bill Denton worked the streets of Akron, Ohio telling anybody he could about Jesus Christ.
[time=2140] It was the days of prohibition and little Bill Denton was about five foot two inches tall.
[time=2146] And he would go to the nose of the gangsters and he would tell them about Jesus Christ.
[time=2151] The Akron Beacon Journal would print articles about how Bill Denton and Wisty Dick, the bootlegger,
[time=2157] would have it out, words in the street of Akron, Ohio.
[time=2161] He was a man radically charged.
[time=2163] He formed a little rescue mission.
[time=2166] Few men came to Christ in that little rescue mission.
[time=2169] It's still there today and just a few men go in and out of it.
[time=2173] He said, "Did Bill Denton's life make a difference?" Made a difference if you were one of the men that came into that mission who found Christ.
[time=2182] Not many, just a few.
[time=2184] It also made a difference because one of the men that he led to Christ was a guy by the name of Dallas Billington.
[time=2191] Dallas Billington started a church.
[time=2193] The Akron Baptist Temple today will have about 8,000 people there.
[time=2198] Oh, another man that Bill Denton led to Christ was a man by the name of Carl Burnham.
[time=2203] He started a little church called the chapel in Akron, Ohio.
[time=2206] There would be about 8,000 people there today.
[time=2210] Because a little man would wring out that Jesus Christ is real.
[time=2216] And he gave a testimony that wouldn't stop.
[time=2219] Oh, they would come to him and they would mock him that he was an immigrant and he wouldn't stop.
[time=2224] They would taunt him because he was so little and he wouldn't stop.
[time=2227] If you didn't want to hear about Jesus Christ, he'd just go wring out his name in another corner.
[time=2233] What a difference it makes when people are radically charged.
[time=2239] With the world in which you live know that Jesus Christ is alive because they can hear your trumpet sounding.
[time=2248] Oh, I don't mean go home and blow your own horn.
[time=2251] What a joy it was this past week to talk to a lady who was led to Christ by another lady in our church.
[time=2259] And she never once was pushing her faith, never once was pushing her church, she just lived alive that rang out.
[time=2270] How's your trumpet? How's your thunder? Are you charged?
[time=2276] These people were radically, radically charged.
[time=2282] Secondly, they were radically changed. The second half of verse 9 says, "Therefore, we do not need to say anything about it, for they, the watching world themselves report what kind of reception you gave us."
[time=2296] They tell how you turned to God from idols.
[time=2303] These people were not only running on enthusiasm, but they were running with a completely radically changed lives.
[time=2312] Here it says, "They turned to God from serving idols."
[time=2319] Picking your religion in the Greek world was a very difficult task.
[time=2323] It was a lot like picking your church in Fort Wayne. There were so many.
[time=2328] There were those that worshipped the Palestinian mysteries. There were Hebrews who worshipped the God Jehovah.
[time=2334] There were those that worshipped Zeus and others who worshipped Diana.
[time=2338] There were those that thought that Iris was the principal God to be worshipped in their city.
[time=2342] There were others that believed in a spirit, the force be with you.
[time=2349] How do you pick your religion? And then suddenly there was this one group who were called the followers of the way.
[time=2356] This Jesus who was crucified, they said that he had risen again.
[time=2363] How would you know what was real?
[time=2366] One way you would know was in the lives of the people.
[time=2370] Did their faith change their lives?
[time=2373] And here the passage says, "These people were so radically changed everywhere that you heard about the life-changing power of Jesus Christ that had come to the city of Thessalonica."
[time=2385] It wasn't their theology, though Paul had it. It wasn't their eloquence, although Paul has had that.
[time=2391] It was the lives that were changed.
[time=2394] You see, men can debate our reasons, they can scorn our philosophy, they can counter-dict our religion, but they cannot argue against a changed life.
[time=2405] These lives were changed. It says that they turned from idols.
[time=2410] The idols of those days were very, very sophisticated.
[time=2414] There is a archaeological find out of Pompeii, that city that was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted and poured out its hot lava.
[time=2424] Then the lava solidified, holding the city locked in time as an archaeological discovery.
[time=2432] There was a temple, and in this temple a huge goddess, idol of Isis.
[time=2439] And archaeologists have discovered that inside the statue was a stairway that the fraudulent priest would climb,
[time=2446] and from the top of the stairway a pipe that ran to the mouth, and so that when you came and worshipped Isis, she talked to you.
[time=2455] But they were smart enough.
[time=2457] The general public knew that it was the priest, they knew of the stairway, they knew of the pipe.
[time=2464] Why then did they worship?
[time=2467] We see an idol isn't really what people worship, it's what the idol represents.
[time=2474] And the wonderful thing about an idol is this.
[time=2477] You get to make up the religion, since you get to make the idol.
[time=2482] So if you like religion, but you don't like the Ten Commandments, you just make up a religion that leaves out the commandments you don't like.
[time=2490] If you like to have a little religion, but you really don't want obligations, then you just frame your religion without the obligations.
[time=2499] And that's what people did.
[time=2501] And so there was always the creation of one new God after another so that people could say, "I don't have to because my God doesn't require that.
[time=2509] I must do this because my God requires it." Well, we're far too sophisticated to worship idols today, yet we create our own values.
[time=2523] We create our own philosophy, we create our own morals, we create our own religion, we do everything that these people did, except for we never personify them with a statue.
[time=2536] There are those of us that the very God of our life is our calendar. Anybody who asks anything of us in the way of time is threatening us, because that is our sacred ground, don't intrude.
[time=2549] Others of us are stature.
[time=2551] Oh, we'd like to be committed to Jesus Christ, but we don't want to make a spiritual commitment that may make us look different in the secular world, and we want to have a certain stature.
[time=2562] There are others of us that our business values and our spiritual values are in conflict and our businesses are God.
[time=2570] There are others of us that our money is our God.
[time=2574] J.D. Rockefeller, at age 33, had made his first million.
[time=2581] At age 43, he controlled the largest company in the world, and at age 53, he was the world's only billionaire of his day.
[time=2592] And at age 53, he was stricken by a rare disease that caused all the hair to fall out of his head.
[time=2599] Not just the top of his head, but his eyebrows and his eyelashes, and his body began to shrivel in the weekend, and he looked like a mummy, according to one writer.
[time=2612] Day and night, he worried about his finances.
[time=2617] He was so hated in the city of Philadelphia that he had to have a bodyguard with him wherever he went, day or night, and the Philadelphia paper printed his obituary ahead of time.
[time=2628] And at age 53, the doctors said he won't last the year.
[time=2635] And J.D. Rockefeller, I have no idea all that took place.
[time=2640] I don't know that he came to Christ, but we do know that Rockefeller said, on one of those sleepless nights, he awoke and discovered that it was his worry about his money that was driving him mad.
[time=2653] And he got up that next morning and determined he was going to spend the rest of his life getting rid of it.
[time=2660] And he started the Rockefeller Foundation.
[time=2663] He started giving money to the churches of his city, to civic groups, to benevolent organizations, and giving his money around the world away.
[time=2672] And at age 53, this man, who could only eat crackers and milk and was under a sentence of death, slowly recovered and died at the ripe old age of 92.
[time=2689] Can I ask you this, who or what is your God?
[time=2697] For J.D. Rockefeller, it was his money. I'll confess to you, as a high school student, it was my athletic involvement.
[time=2705] What's the God of your life?
[time=2708] Who is it that you worship?
[time=2710] What is it that you refuse to give up?
[time=2715] That is the God of your life.
[time=2720] The remarkable thing about these people is they radically changed. They turned away from their gods.
[time=2727] And they turned to serve the true and the living God.
[time=2732] The black mark on Christianity today, what we will tragically be remembered for when church historians write in the future, is that we turned in mass to God, but we did not turn away from our other gods.
[time=2749] You see, we are of all people. We are polytheistic. We serve many gods.
[time=2760] So many of us here today, we want to serve Jesus Christ, but we don't want to give up our other gods.
[time=2767] It's almost shocking when people say, "You mean if I give my life to Jesus Christ, he's going to tell me what to do with my sex life?"
[time=2775] Yes, he is. You mean if I follow Jesus Christ, he's going to tell me how to manage my money? Yes, he is.
[time=2783] You mean if I give my life to Jesus Christ, he's going to tell me what words I can say and what words I can't say? Yes, he is.
[time=2790] You mean if I give my life to Jesus Christ, he's going to put his finger on my temperament and he's going to tell me to transform it? Yes, he is.
[time=2801] But most of us want to have Jesus Christ not as our God, but as one of our gods.
[time=2809] And we're not radically changed.
[time=2812] And then we say, "Why don't we have that power that the Church of Thessalonica had?" Why don't we have that radical charge that the world knows of our faith in Jesus Christ?
[time=2822] It's because we've only turned to Christ and we haven't turned away from our other gods.
[time=2830] If you want to have a radical faith, you've got to make a radical turn away from the other gods of your life.
[time=2841] These people made that transformation.
[time=2845] Was it hard? Let me tell you what it would cost these people.
[time=2849] If they were of a Hebrew faith, they would have to turn away from the synagogue. They were already a ridiculed minority in their community.
[time=2860] And the only comfort they had was each other.
[time=2863] And now if you were a Hebrew and you rejected the tradition that Jesus was not Messiah and you said that he was, you were a double alien.
[time=2873] You were a Hebrew in a Greek city, but unwanted by the Hebrews.
[time=2880] If you were a Greek, they found it in a laughable condition.
[time=2887] If you were a Greek, the Romans would call it a "treasonable condition."
[time=2894] For you see, one of the gods of their world was called Pontifus Maximus. It's Latin for highest priest.
[time=2903] And that was the title of the emperor.
[time=2906] And when you were a Roman citizen, you not only said that Nero was emperor, you said that Nero was God.
[time=2914] And for them to turn away from that God, it was called treason.
[time=2920] It cost them their lives in many cases, but they radically turned away from their other gods and they turned to Christ.
[time=2930] What a difference it made.
[time=2933] Thirdly, these people were radically committed.
[time=2939] On a moment of enthusiasm, we can get excited and say, "I'm going to do this."
[time=2945] And then later we say, "Why did I say I'm going to do this?" You've seen the television commercial. I love the enthusiastic clerk on the telephone.
[time=2953] He answers the phone and says, "Sure, I can do that. No problem, I'll do that." And about five times he promises, and then the phone stops and he says, "How am I going to do that?" Have you ever made one of those commitments? Oh, I'll do that.
[time=2966] And how do you live up to it?
[time=2968] You know, many of us make that type of commitment spiritually. It's not deep.
[time=2973] It's not genuine. It's only emotional that somebody got us fired up.
[time=2977] And then when they left, the fire left with them.
[time=2981] That wasn't the case of these people. They were radically committed.
[time=2986] It shows up in two phrases.
[time=2989] First of all, it says, "They turned to serve and they turned to wait."
[time=2999] Their turning was a knowledgeable, intellectual, planned, purposeful act.
[time=3007] If you were a gramarian study in this passage, you would say that the action is that they turned,
[time=3013] and the purpose of the action was they turned for the purpose of serving, and they turned for the purpose of waiting.
[time=3022] The word to serve there is not a gallant term.
[time=3027] So often we picture an aristocratic setting where even the servants are treated with great respect.
[time=3035] Perhaps they're called charles instead of Charlie.
[time=3040] And they wear uniforms and they're treated with great dignity.
[time=3044] This word is the word for "bond slave."
[time=3050] Perhaps as much as one-fourth or more of the Roman Empire were slaves.
[time=3055] They were fighting to get out of slavery.
[time=3058] There was an insurrectionist by the name of Barabbas who was trying to overthrow the Romans because he didn't like being a slave.
[time=3066] It was harsh. It was cruel.
[time=3069] And the whole Roman world was trying to get free.
[time=3074] And suddenly they hear, "Did you hear about this church?" Church, what's your church? Well, it's a group of people.
[time=3080] "Did you hear about what they do?" They chosen to make themselves slaves.
[time=3085] To who? Well, get this.
[time=3089] To a dead guy named Jesus, who they said came back to life.
[time=3097] That's radical, that they chose to be slaves.
[time=3103] There was a story told from the days of slavery in America
[time=3109] where a man who owned slaves was so impressed with one of his slaves, faith in Jesus Christ that he couldn't deny it.
[time=3118] And finally, the master went to the servant and said, "How is it that you are so filled with joy in spite of the way you're being inhumanely treated?" And the slave told him of his faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3131] And the master said, "Can I have this faith in Jesus Christ?"
[time=3137] And the slave said, "Yes you can." The master said, "How can I have this faith?" And the slave said, "You must come down to the slave quarters and live with me and be a slave."
[time=3151] The master went away sadly.
[time=3153] The burden of his heart even greater.
[time=3155] And after a few days, he came to the slave and said, "I'm willing to live like a slave with you." And the slave said, "Master, you don't have to do that.
[time=3165] You just have to be willing to do that." You see, when we give our lives to Jesus Christ, we've got to be willing to do whatever he wants us to, because he now owns us.
[time=3178] He owns me, he owns you.
[time=3181] He owns your clothes and your car, he owns your children, he owns your time and he owns your checkbook if you're his slave.
[time=3189] Now he's a gentle and great master, but don't ever forget.
[time=3194] We have turned to him with a radical commitment.
[time=3197] We're committed to being his slave.
[time=3203] How long are you going to live like that?
[time=3206] You can put up with anything for a day or even a week, but how long are you going to live for that?
[time=3213] These people decided they were going to live that way until Jesus comes.
[time=3219] That could have been in their day, any day, or it could have been 100 years away.
[time=3224] Well, we now know it's been almost 2,000, but he could come tomorrow or it could be another 2,000, and the radical commitment says, "I'm going to keep on living as Jesus wants me to live until I die or until he comes." That is a radical commitment.
[time=3246] In this passage it says, "They turned to wait for his son." You see, the promise of Jesus Christ was not only that he had come and died for their sins, but his second promise was that he was coming again, and these people lived and worked with one eye towards the east, looking for Jesus.
[time=3266] Could this be the night he would come?
[time=3269] And they were waiting.
[time=3271] Now the word "waiting" often speaks to us of a waiting room in the hospital.
[time=3275] Where you do nothing but pace and worry.
[time=3278] But waiting has a different concept.
[time=3281] It speaks of an active patience.
[time=3283] It speaks as the one who is doing, who is serving, who is living according to a plan, waiting for the day that the new orders come.
[time=3294] When a soldier is drafted into the army, he serves in that army while he waits for his dismissal to come.
[time=3304] He is waiting for the discharge, but Uncle Sam is going to keep him busy until the paper works done.
[time=3311] And Jesus said, "They'll come a day when I will take you home, or I will come again and take you all home collectively, but until that day you just keep on serving till I come." It's our joy and our hope and our longing that Jesus Christ will come again.
[time=3330] I'm not an emotional manipulator, so I'm not trying to use a fear tactic, but what if Jesus came today?
[time=3337] Somebody took the words towards the night before Christmas and changed it to this.
[time=3341] Towards the night before Jesus came and all through the house, not a creature was praying, not one in that house.
[time=3349] Their Bibles were all placed on the shelf without care in the hopes that Jesus would not come there.
[time=3355] The children were all dressing to crawl into bed, not once ever kneeling or bowing the head.
[time=3361] And Mom and her rocker with baby on her lap was watching the late show while I took a nap.
[time=3368] When out of the Easter rose such a clatter, I sprang to my feet to see what was a matter.
[time=3373] I waited to the window, I flew like a flash.
[time=3377] I tore open the shutters and threw up the sash when what to my wandering eyes should appear, but angels proclaiming that Jesus was here.
[time=3389] With a light like the sun sending forth a bright ray, I knew in a moment this must be the day.
[time=3396] The light of his face made me cover my head.
[time=3400] It was Jesus returning, just as he said.
[time=3405] And though I possessed worldly wisdom and wealth, I cried when I saw him in spite of myself.
[time=3411] And the book of life which he held in his hand was written the name of every saved man.
[time=3417] He spoke not a word as he searched for my name when he said it's not here, my head hung in shame.
[time=3425] The people whose names had been written with love he gathered to take to his father above.
[time=3432] With those who were ready here rose without a sound while all of the rest of us were standing around.
[time=3440] I fell to my knees, but it was too late.
[time=3443] I had waited too long and thus sealed my fate.
[time=3447] I stood and I cried as they rose out of sight.
[time=3451] Oh, if only we had been ready tonight.
[time=3457] In the words of this poem the meaning is clear.
[time=3461] The coming of Jesus is drawing near.
[time=3466] There's only one life and when he comes the last call we will find that the Bible was true after all.
[time=3480] These people were radical in their commitment.
[time=3484] They were willing to serve and they were willing to wait.
[time=3490] Radical Christianity.
[time=3492] People who are radically charged, people who are radically changed, people who are radically committed.
