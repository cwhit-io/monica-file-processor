[time=90] Our faith is losing its appeal.
[time=100] It's no longer contagious as more and more phonies try to cash in on Christianity.
[time=107] As a college student, I can remember our school newspaper had a regular ad on how you could get a phony degree for ten dollars.
[time=115] One offered a degree called the Doctor of Generosity. They even had a lot in motto to give credence.
[time=123] But when you loosely translated the Latin it went something like this.
[time=127] You may think you're a hot stuff, Buster, but we know you.
[time=131] Where's the real faith? Where's the Christianity that's contagious?
[time=138] That's contagious.
[time=152] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=157] Thank you for joining us.
[time=159] Rick is continuing his series from the book of Thessalonians with the message he has entitled, "Contagious Christianity."
[time=166] Too frequently the news tells us of one more collapsing ministry or one more phony in the religion business.
[time=173] Christianity has lost its purity and with that it's appeal.
[time=177] Most of the stories are not as humorous as Rick's account of the Doctor of Generosity.
[time=182] Today on the Bible Hour we will look at four relevant principles that make Christianity contagious.
[time=188] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Thessalonians.
[time=193] Rick's text is taken from chapter 2 verses 11 and 12.
[time=198] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=204] Other special music includes a selection from the handbell choir and a solo from Kathy Hawks.
[time=214] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=223] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=227] Now, here's Rick.
[time=231] I love you and we've come today to declare that.
[time=234] We welcome you this morning to our worship service on this Palm Sunday.
[time=238] We've gathered in this place to praise the name of Jesus.
[time=242] Palm Sunday was a unique day in the life of Jesus.
[time=246] Much of his life was marked by opposition, misunderstanding and even punctuated by hatred.
[time=254] But there was one day when they recognized that Jesus Christ was actually God.
[time=260] And the tide of popular opinion for that moment was focused in on him.
[time=265] The way they rolled out the red carpet was to roll out the green carpet.
[time=270] They took branches off of palm trees, waved them, yelled Hosanna and then cast them before
[time=276] the entrance of nobility and royalty.
[time=279] And they recognized that Jesus Christ was God and he was King.
[time=283] And they sang Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=286] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=289] That's the theme of our choir song this morning.
[time=300] [MUSIC]
[time=309] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=313] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=316] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=320] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=323] King of Israel, welcome to our hearts.
[time=328] Here to reign in righteousness.
[time=331] O ruler of the world, ruler of our hearts.
[time=336] Thou hast end your throne.
[time=340] You are the King of kings.
[time=343] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=346] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=350] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=353] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=357] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=360] King Jerusalem to the sons of men.
[time=364] Fighting, holding, simple, spring.
[time=368] O come to sing our own.
[time=370] Come to give your life.
[time=372] The King of Israel is our will.
[time=376] You are the King of kings.
[time=379] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=384] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=388] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=391] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=395] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=398] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=402] Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=405] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=408] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna.
[time=411] King of Israel.
[time=413] Welcome to our hearts.
[time=416] He is to reign in righteousness.
[time=419] O ruler of the world, ruler of our hearts.
[time=424] Thou hast end your throne.
[time=427] [MUSIC - 24 seconds]
[time=454] (audience applauding) (audience applauding) - We get very excited as we stand along the parade route and watch for our special bands or floats to come.
[time=468] Can you imagine what it was like to hold a palm branch and lay it down before the feet of Jesus?
[time=474] What an exciting time.
[time=475] Then again, we can look forward to that time when he promises to come again for those that love him and know Jesus as Savior.
[time=482] Blessed assurance Jesus' mind, him number 345.
[time=487] We'll sing all three stanzas together, him number 345.
[time=491] ("Pomp and Circumstance") [MUSIC - 335 seconds]
[time=836] - We are here celebrating Palm Sunday, but as most of you are watching it is Easter, and so we want to wish you a very happy and joyful Easter.
[time=846] And we also want to invite our friends to the Easter Musical.
[time=849] - Well, those that are in this area, Rick, are certainly invited to our Easter Musical.
[time=853] It's on Sunday evening at 6 p.m., Easter Sunday night, and we're doing a musical entitled At Calvary.
[time=861] Actually, we've put together a series of songs that speak about reflections of what people saw and felt during the time when Jesus was led to Calvary and the eventual crucifixion, and of course, then the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=876] - Well, this is the highlight of all that we celebrate, that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=881] So if you are in the greater Fort Wayne area on this Easter, we hope that you'll come and join us at 6 o'clock for a celebration and proclamation that Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=894] I also want to encourage you friends who live in the northeastern Indiana Quadrant that we call Politically the Fourth District to remember that Tuesday, March the 28th, there is a special congressional election.
[time=909] And one of the things that I am so concerned about is the growing of the wealthy and our nation.
[time=915] Our voter turnout is one of the lowest in all of the voting democratic countries in the world, where free elections are held, Americans show up at an alarmingly low rate.
[time=929] Sometimes we feel like our vote doesn't make a difference.
[time=933] But in the 1960 presidential election, President John Kennedy won that election by less than one vote that is present across the nation.
[time=944] Your vote does make a difference.
[time=946] And please remember, Tuesday, March the 28th is a special congressional election.
[time=952] I believe it's our responsibility as citizens, and then doubly our responsibility as Christians to shape our nation, and the best way we can do that is in the ballot of voting.
[time=964] Well, today we want to encourage you to be a student of God's Word.
[time=968] We offer you this excellent booklet called A Closer Walk.
[time=972] Its title speaks of its purpose.
[time=974] To give us a closer walk with God.
[time=977] The cover, of course, is beautiful, but the real power is on the inside.
[time=981] As it takes us on a tour through the Bible, this tour through the Bible will give us the New Testament in one year's time period.
[time=990] Inside it will give you timeless insight, some teaching from great men of God.
[time=995] It will also include a biography for each month to tell you the life of a great writer like Martin Luther, or some other person like the great commentators of our day, or Charles Haddon Spurgeon.
[time=1007] It will also share with you other helpful Christian literature.
[time=1010] We'd like to send you a copy if you'll write to us, please.
[time=1014] If you'll write to us today, we'll send you a copy.
[time=1017] You need to write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1027] Once again, it's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1036] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1038] I so enjoy our choirs' music, and particularly the song they sang "Hosanna" this morning.
[time=1043] That had to be a tricky song for them to learn.
[time=1046] It's very rhythmic, Rick, but it does depict the fact that Jesus had a triumphal entry into the city, and we wanted to remember that today, and we appreciate, too, the ministry of the handbells.
[time=1056] They're very faithful, and all of our soloists do a great job, and we look forward to hearing Kathy, your wife sing in just a few moments.
[time=1063] Well, she's going to sing a song that I love that's called "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, You Are My King." And we hope today that Jesus Christ is your Messiah, your Redeemer, and that He's the King on the throne in your life.
[time=1079] He was born in this world to a virgin.
[time=1097] It was told that way since he was before.
[time=1102] He opened an entrance to heaven, so he could pass through the door.
[time=1112] If human would listen, and less would be mean,
[time=1120] and invisible kingdom, they could not come soon.
[time=1125] He suffered a death, and he purchased a crown for me.
[time=1132] "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, You Are My King."
[time=1142] King of kings, "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, My One Messiah,
[time=1152] He's the Lord."
[time=1160] He spoke with the wisdom of angels, of a kingdom that we could not see, and he promised we'd live there forever.
[time=1175] If only we could think we could.
[time=1183] Wise ones to seek him, yet no man can say that this man named Jesus is not who he claims.
[time=1193] He rose from his grave, and he lives with me still today.
[time=1203] "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, You Are My King."
[time=1211] King of kings, "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, My Lord Messiah,
[time=1221] He's the Lord." "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, My One Messiah, You Are My King." King of kings, "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, My One Messiah,
[time=1248] My Redeemer, You Are My King."
[time=1255] King of kings, "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, My One Messiah,
[time=1265] Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, You Are My King."
[time=1273] King of kings, "Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, My Lord Messiah,
[time=1283] Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, You Are My King."
[time=1291] King of kings, "Blessed Messiah."
[time=1298] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1305] Our God and Father, we praise You today for Jesus Christ, our Blessed Messiah, My Redeemer, Lord Jesus, You Are the Mighty King, and we've gathered here today to worship You in this world that calls us to back in attention to sports, in the drama, to music, to entertainment, to work, and recreation.
[time=1330] We come today to worship You and say that You are God of all and above all, and to praise Your name.
[time=1338] Thank You for the choir singing, Hosanna.
[time=1341] Thank You for that proclamation that Jesus Christ is King.
[time=1345] Thank You for the song that Kathy has sung that tells us, You are the Messiah, You have come.
[time=1350] You've died from my sins.
[time=1353] Thank You for the bells that would ring today, that Jesus Christ is risen.
[time=1358] Thank You for that proof and assurance to our own minds that You are God.
[time=1364] And we pray today that You would be exalted in everything that we do in all that we say.
[time=1370] May You have a triumphal entry this day into our hearts.
[time=1374] May we know the power of the resurrected Christ, working in our lives.
[time=1379] We pray that You would give power and encouragement to those today who walk through the valley of the shadow of death with loved ones.
[time=1388] We pray for Ed Eppley in the loss of his mother, Gene Nelson in the loss of her grandmother, for Mimi Copic, and Sharon Huddleson and others who have had to walk through that valley.
[time=1400] We pray this morning for Carol Haberle, as her mother is so ill with congestive heart failure that You would give strength to her spirit and help her to mother to know even in an intensive care unit that her heart is being cared for by Jesus Christ will give eternal life.
[time=1419] We pray that You would give that sense of power that raised Christ from the dead to those of us who would face doubts and discouragement.
[time=1428] Fortify our minds, double our courage.
[time=1432] Give us today a faith in Jesus Christ that is relevant, that is real, and that's contagious.
[time=1440] For it's in His name that we pray.
[time=1443] [AMEN] As Jesus entered into the city of Jerusalem, He was riding not only on the cold of a donkey, but He was riding on the wave of popular opinion.
[time=1458] His miracles had thrust Him into the foreground and the limelight of all of Jerusalem.
[time=1464] His entrance was grand.
[time=1466] It was regal. It was the Messiah.
[time=1469] And all that He was doing was contagious.
[time=1473] And for that brief moment in time, Christianity was contagious.
[time=1480] It was a driving force that had captured the imagination of the world of Jerusalem as they came to see this one who raised Lazarus from the dead to take note of an individual who could take and multiply loaves and fishes into a feast for thousands.
[time=1500] Could this be the one who would rid them of Roman occupation of the tyranny of the power of Caesar?
[time=1509] There was excitement.
[time=1511] There was a faith that was brewing.
[time=1513] It was breeding and it was multiplying.
[time=1516] And it was contagious.
[time=1520] It lasted only for a day because in the very next day, the tide of popular opinion had already shifted.
[time=1529] Like a powerful wave that crashes on the shore, it was now retreating and drawing away from Christ.
[time=1536] His enemies were plotting His death.
[time=1539] His friends were calculating their odds, and many of them were falling away.
[time=1544] And that faith was no longer contagious.
[time=1549] In 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, the Apostle Paul speaks about faith in the face of adversity, a faith that is under attack, a faith that is misunderstood, but a faith that is still contagious.
[time=1565] If you have a Bible, we're studying through 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, and here we meet contagious Christianity.
[time=1576] I have a new international translation of the Bible.
[time=1580] You may have a different one.
[time=1582] I invite you all to read along silently.
[time=1585] I'll read it aloud for us.
[time=1587] 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 1 through 12.
[time=1593] You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.
[time=1598] We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know.
[time=1605] But with the help of our God, we dared to tell you this gospel in spite of strong opposition.
[time=1614] For the appeal we make does not spring from error or in pure motives.
[time=1620] We are not trying to trick you on the contrary.
[time=1626] We speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel.
[time=1632] We are not trying to please men, but God who tests our hearts.
[time=1639] You know that we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed.
[time=1646] God is our witness.
[time=1648] We are not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else.
[time=1656] As apostles of Christ, we could have been a burden to you, but we were gentle among you.
[time=1663] Like a mother caring for her little children.
[time=1667] We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you
[time=1673] not only the gospel of God, but our lives as well.
[time=1679] Because you had become so dear to us.
[time=1682] Surely you remember brothers, our toil and our hardship.
[time=1687] We worked at night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preach the gospel of God to you.
[time=1696] You are our witnesses, and so is God of how holy, righteous
[time=1702] and blameless we were among you who believed.
[time=1706] For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God who calls you into his kingdom
[time=1721] and glory.
[time=1723] Contagious Christianity.
[time=1726] We live in a time when people are trying to cash in on Christianity.
[time=1731] Integrity and credibility are gone.
[time=1734] They've been washed out with the wave of the sea as it's retreated away from the popularity of the gospel.
[time=1743] But here Paul speaks of a faith in Jesus Christ that was compelling.
[time=1748] That was contagious.
[time=1750] I remember attending the University of Akron.
[time=1753] We had a school newspaper called the Book Delight.
[time=1755] On the last page there were always the same two advertisements and one of them I clipped regularly.
[time=1762] On the back page of our newspaper for 96 cents.
[time=1766] Now this is going back 15 years, but for 96 cents you could get a full-size whopper, a medium coke, and a large fry.
[time=1777] And the governor asked for four cents.
[time=1779] It made it an even buck for a great lunch, and I'd clipped those out, and I remember next to that Burger King coupon every week there was another ad.
[time=1788] That ad was a paper mill that offered degrees and diplomas to anyone who would send ten dollars.
[time=1794] They were religious degrees.
[time=1797] Degrees that for ten bucks you could be ordained, licensed, confirmed, whatever you wanted to be as long as you agreed with the doctrinal statement.
[time=1805] The doctrinal statement was we believe what you believe if you believe it.
[time=1813] And somehow Christianity got caught in the crossfire.
[time=1819] And the world looks and says religion.
[time=1822] Isn't it just a game?
[time=1824] Isn't it just a highly sophisticated scam?
[time=1828] I mean isn't it a little bit suspicious?
[time=1832] But today is not the first day we've ever been misunderstood, under attack.
[time=1837] Paul is writing here of a contagious Christianity that is under attack, and he gives four principles for my life and four principles for your life of how to make our faith in Jesus Christ contagious.
[time=1851] Principle number one is this one, pure motives.
[time=1856] In verses one through six Paul is defending his motives against attack.
[time=1862] There is a general accusation and then there are three specific charges.
[time=1867] The general accusation leveled against Paul was simply this, he's nothing but a trouble making phony.
[time=1875] In chapter two verses one they are referring to what happened in Philippi.
[time=1881] Paul had been beaten, he had been arrested in Philippi, and having left Philippi he shows up in Thessaloniki.
[time=1889] There in Thessaloniki Acts chapter 17 tells us a group of people
[time=1895] gathered together some thugs, and they started a riot, and they were out looking for Paul, running to put him in jail, and their charges were these.
[time=1906] He is a trouble maker everywhere he has been.
[time=1910] He's a phony, just hitting town after town, town after town.
[time=1917] There were phonies like that, but Paul was not one of them.
[time=1923] But the people in Thessaloniki who didn't want to hear about Christ were looking and they said, "He's just a trouble maker.
[time=1929] We heard about the trouble he caused up in Philippi." And not only that, he is saying there's another king besides Caesar.
[time=1938] It's interesting, these Greeks didn't have a fondness of Caesar, but suddenly when they wanted to attack Paul they said, "Well, we're loyal to Caesar." And this man says, "There's another king, Jesus." So they made a general accusation.
[time=1954] This guy is a phony.
[time=1956] He's a trouble maker.
[time=1958] There have always been those types.
[time=1961] It reminds me of one of my favorite books of all time, "Huckleberry Finn," filled with adventure and delight.
[time=1969] And Mark Twain tells the story about such a phony back in the mid-1800s.
[time=1975] Huck Finn is drifting downriver on the Mississippi, and he meets two individuals who introduced themselves as the king and the duke.
[time=1984] The duke was no duke and the king was no king.
[time=1987] They were just two con men working the river.
[time=1990] And whenever they hit a town they had a new scam for every town.
[time=1995] The three of them hit the city of Polkville.
[time=1998] And when they hit the city there was a big old-fashioned revival going on.
[time=2003] The preacher was ranting and raving and hollering, saying out the names of people who needed the Lord, and the audience was just as active, yelling "Amen" and "Hallelujah." Huck says, "The next thing I knowed, the king took the platform away from the preacher." And he was yelling louder than the rest of them and asked the preacher if he couldn't speak.
[time=2023] And the preacher said, "Huck, well, he'd done it." The king waxes eloquent, Huck says, telling this crowd about how he had been a pirate in the Indian Ocean.
[time=2036] And they had come back to get a new crew together and just last night he was beaten and robbed and thrown ashore right here in Polkville.
[time=2045] But the king says, "Don't feel bad for me.
[time=2047] It's the best thing that ever happened to me because I've come here to this meeting and I found the tree light." And now he's going back to the Indian Ocean to convert the rest of the pirates.
[time=2059] Being one, he could work the field the best.
[time=2062] And when those pirates come to the way in the truth, the king wasn't going to tell him to thank him.
[time=2069] No, sir, they were to thank those dear people back in Polkville and that preacher, the finest friend a pirate ever had.
[time=2078] And here came the hook.
[time=2080] Then the king says to the crowd, "And I'm going to get there.
[time=2083] I don't know how, being robbed and poor and all, but I'm going to get there." And the audience picked right up on it.
[time=2091] One of them yelled, "Take up a collection.
[time=2093] Somebody else yells, "Take up a collection." Another guy yells, "Pass the hat." Hux said, "The next thing he knew, there was the king crying in the sob and hat in his hand, taking a little bit of money from each one of them." By the time the king got done working the crowd and they'd slipped out of town.
[time=2111] Hux said, "The king had collected $87.75 cents and a three gallon jug of whiskey." There's always been a king turned pirate, turned missionary, turned con man.
[time=2126] Was Paul such a one?
[time=2128] Was he just the king and the duke and another scam being run on a different river than the Mississippi?
[time=2135] Paul gives his defense.
[time=2137] Look at verses one and two.
[time=2139] He gives a defense against that accusation.
[time=2142] Defense number one is this.
[time=2144] You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.
[time=2149] Paul says, "You want proof that our ministry's authentic?
[time=2152] Look at how Jesus Christ changed your lives." These Thessalonians had come to Christ and their life had been changed.
[time=2163] That was proof number one.
[time=2164] Proof number two, Paul sets the record straight.
[time=2167] He wasn't a troublemaker in Philippi.
[time=2170] He was insulted and mistreated.
[time=2173] He was a Roman citizen.
[time=2175] And it was illegal for him to be beaten the way he was.
[time=2178] And when they found that out in Philippi, they came.
[time=2181] The officials humbly and said, "Paul, we're sorry.
[time=2186] You're free to go now." And Paul said, "Wait a minute.
[time=2190] You arrested us in broad daylight.
[time=2192] Don't try to dismiss us in the night time." And they stayed in jail requesting a public dropping of the charges.
[time=2201] The second proof was our testimony is solid.
[time=2205] Check it out in Philippi.
[time=2207] We were insulted and mistreated there.
[time=2209] We weren't some rascals chased out of town.
[time=2213] And then his third proof is this one, the end of verse two.
[time=2217] But with the help of God, we dared to tell you this gospel in spite of strong opposition.
[time=2225] Paul's point is this.
[time=2226] If we were nothing but a bunch of phonies in the city of Philippi, we would have never come to this city to tell you about the gospel.
[time=2236] In the face of opposition, we would have just cleared out of town and worked a different city with a different scam.
[time=2243] Paul said those accusations are general and they're not true.
[time=2249] Then they gave three specific charges.
[time=2252] Charge number one, they had was that Paul was deluded.
[time=2256] Charge number two, that he was depraved.
[time=2260] Charge number three, that he was a deceiver.
[time=2263] Look at verse three.
[time=2264] Here are the specific charges.
[time=2266] He said, "For the appeal we make does not spring from error." The word "air" refers not only to a mental miscalculation, but perhaps an emotional deception that they were saying, "Paul, maybe you're gospel.
[time=2279] Maybe all you're saying it's springing from the fact that, maybe you got hit a little too hard on the head at Lister when that rock hit you.
[time=2286] Maybe you're deluded.
[time=2288] Maybe you're deceived." Do you know that was said of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=2293] In Mark chapter three, verse 21, because of Christ's gospel message, his audience looked at him and said, "Wow, this is far out.
[time=2304] This is too much.
[time=2306] He must be out of his mind." When Paul stood before Festus and he presented the gospel, Festus said, "Paul, you're preaching is driven you mad." Specific charge number one, don't listen to Paul because he's off as rocker.
[time=2320] He's deluded.
[time=2321] Charge number two is this.
[time=2324] He's depraved.
[time=2326] Our gospel did not only spring not from error, but it did not spring from impure motives.
[time=2332] The Greek words there for impure motives are sexual terms, because in that day and tragically in our day it appears, religion and sexual promiscuity went together.
[time=2345] In the city of Corinth there was a high hill, and a crop-less if you will, and on the top of it a temple to a pagan god.
[time=2354] In that temple there were 3,000 prostitute priestess, and nightly they would come out of the temple with their lanterns, and they'd go into the cosmopolitan city of Corinth, soliciting men who wanted to engage in sexual immorality, to go back to the temple with them.
[time=2372] And if you were involved in religion you were probably somewhat of a depraved sexual person as well.
[time=2380] That was a charge levied against Paul.
[time=2383] Probably guilt by association.
[time=2388] Maybe it was though they misunderstood some early things that happened in the church.
[time=2393] In the church they loved each other, and they greeted each other with a holy kiss.
[time=2398] There was nothing sexual about it.
[time=2400] It was pure.
[time=2402] But this outside observer says, "Hey, do you hear what they're doing down at the church?" They're all standing around kissing each other.
[time=2410] When did they do that?
[time=2411] Well, they did that right after this event they called "The Love Feast." Rumor has it, it's a big orgy.
[time=2418] In the Roman world looked at the church and said, "What are you doing down there?" Maybe this Paul is a sexual perfect.
[time=2428] The third charge that they specifically put against him was that he was purposely a deceiver.
[time=2433] That he was trying to trick them.
[time=2436] How was he trying to trick them?
[time=2438] They accused him of tricking with flattery.
[time=2441] You know, if you say just the right words, you say enough nice things about people, they respond and they love you.
[time=2448] Benjamin Franklin said the surest way to sell newspapers is to print the name of every man in Philadelphia.
[time=2454] Then you'll buy one.
[time=2456] That's kind of our human nature.
[time=2458] If you say enough nice things about me, I'm going to like you no matter who you are.
[time=2462] And Paul said, verse three, "We are not trying to trick you." On the contrary, we speak as men, approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel.
[time=2474] We are not trying to please men but God who tests our hearts.
[time=2479] We never used flattery.
[time=2484] Paul said, "We weren't trying to deceive you.
[time=2486] We weren't smooth talkers telling you what we thought you wanted to hear.
[time=2490] We weren't saying, "What will please this crowd?" He said, "We only declared what we knew to be the truth in Jesus Christ.
[time=2498] No tricks up our sleeves.
[time=2500] No deception." They thought that Paul was trying to deceive them with flattery for the purpose of money.
[time=2508] He said, "We never used flattery as a mask, a cloak, something to cover up greed." There were in those days as there are in our days those who use the gospel as a way of personal gain
[time=2525] at a extravagant rate.
[time=2528] Was Paul just working in Philippi and Berea and Thessal and Eichy trying to have a tent meeting so that he could whip up a crowd together so that he could put on the heat for money?
[time=2541] Those were the charges.
[time=2543] Deluded, depraved, the deceiver.
[time=2547] How does Paul answer them?
[time=2549] He answers them with two simple points.
[time=2551] One, we've been approved of by God, and two, we've been approved of by you.
[time=2558] On the contrary, verse 4, we speak as men approved by God entrusted with the gospel.
[time=2565] Paul hadn't hit Thessal and Eichy, and this was the first time he had presented the gospel.
[time=2570] God had tested and proved Paul three years in the desert of Arabia.
[time=2575] Then Paul spent eight years in his hometown of Taurus.
[time=2581] Then he had spent a missionary journey throughout Asia Minor before he'd ever come.
[time=2588] He had been tested and proved by God.
[time=2591] And then the second proof he had was those people.
[time=2595] Repeatedly, he points to his defense that they knew him.
[time=2599] Look at chapter 1, verse 5.
[time=2603] You know how we lived among you.
[time=2607] Chapter 2, verse 1.
[time=2609] You know that our visit to you was not a failure.
[time=2614] Chapter 2, verse 5.
[time=2616] You know that we never used flattery.
[time=2620] Chapter 2, verse 11.
[time=2623] For you know that we dealt with each of you like a father.
[time=2628] Chapter 3, verses 3 and 4.
[time=2633] So that no one would be unsettled by the trials.
[time=2636] You know quite well that we were destined for them.
[time=2641] Chapter 4, verse 2.
[time=2643] You know what instructions we gave you.
[time=2647] Paul is repeatedly saying you want proof of our character.
[time=2651] We lived among you.
[time=2652] We worked among you.
[time=2654] You knew us.
[time=2655] We weren't some celebrities who came and set up a tent, took an offering and got out of town.
[time=2663] Paul's making a defense here for a genuine, authentic, Christian faith.
[time=2669] The first principle is that if our faith is going to be contagious.
[time=2674] If it's something that we can give away, it's going to have to be born out by pure motives.
[time=2681] Let's boil it down to some practical applications here.
[time=2685] I'm not meaning to be critical of someone who does it differently.
[time=2689] If you like some of the ways I'm going to mention, I accept that.
[time=2692] Please accept that I'm different.
[time=2695] But some people will have a great big invitation to invite friends to church.
[time=2701] And by the time it gets to the friend, the invitation is like this.
[time=2706] Our Sunday school class is having a contest with an under Sunday school class to see who can get the most people there.
[time=2712] Would you mind coming to church Sunday so my class wins?
[time=2717] That's not very contagious.
[time=2719] To be honest with you, I wouldn't want to come to church so I can fill up a pew so you can say, "Haha, my class is bigger than your class." Paul said, "Our motives have to be pure.
[time=2729] Our motives have to be." We shared hot dogs on the grill.
[time=2734] I remember when I was out of town, I came home and my driveway was shoveled.
[time=2738] You did that for me.
[time=2740] I remember the picnic we had together on the last day of spring break.
[time=2744] It was a great time together.
[time=2746] I know you care for me and I care for you.
[time=2750] That's why I wanted to ask you.
[time=2752] Next Sunday's Easter, would you like to go to church with me?
[time=2756] Purity of motives.
[time=2759] Christianity is often the victim of our own misdoing because we're trying to get people to come to church so we can say,
[time=2767] "My class is bigger than your class.
[time=2769] Our church is bigger than your church." If we get a hundred more people to come to church, maybe they'd help pay for all this.
[time=2776] Contagious Christianity is one that has purity of motives.
[time=2781] Principle number two is it has a pleasing method.
[time=2785] Verses seven and eight.
[time=2787] As apostles of Christ, we could have been a burden to you, but we were gentle among you like a mother caring for her children.
[time=2799] Sometimes it's not so much what we say, but how we say it.
[time=2803] I remember we had bought the product at a local electronic store that will not be mentioned by name.
[time=2809] And it died about three weeks later.
[time=2812] I took it back to the store and said, "You know, it's not working.
[time=2817] Can you fix it or replace it?" And the man said, "Do you have your sales receipt?" I got him.
[time=2822] I had my sales receipt.
[time=2824] "Do you have the original packaging?" I said, "The original packaging?"
[time=2834] He said, "Well, for us to be able to give you a refund, we have to have the original packaging." I said, "Ah, you mean everything you buy, you're supposed to store every box, every piece of styrofoam, every piece of plastic in your attic?"
[time=2845] He said, "Well, that's our policy." I said, "Okay, okay." Can I talk to the sales manager?
[time=2853] Sales manager came over and he said, "Oh, we'll give you another one." Then he proceeded to give me a lecture about how I was supposed to keep the box and the packaging and the styrofoam.
[time=2862] And by the time I left the store, I was given the brand new piece of electronics.
[time=2867] They had did exactly what I wanted, but they had done it in such a way.
[time=2871] I said, "I'll never come back." And there's a valid lesson for us to learn.
[time=2877] It's not just important what we do.
[time=2879] It's important how we do what we do.
[time=2884] Our methods have to be pleasing.
[time=2888] Now, we're not out there trying to say, "How can we please people?" But it's simply a matter of being gracious and gentle and affirming, finding a way to encourage.
[time=2899] Paul had an option.
[time=2902] His option was he could have represented himself truthfully as an apostle.
[time=2908] He notes that he says, "As apostles of Christ, we could have been a burden to you."
[time=2915] There weren't very many apostles.
[time=2917] And when you were an apostle, you were a somebody.
[time=2923] And Paul said, "We could have come to you and we could have introduced ourselves as, "Hello.
[time=2928] I'm apostle Paul and this is my amanuensis Silas." And they could have demanded first-rate treatment, lodging and accommodations fit for the best.
[time=2939] They were somebody's.
[time=2942] That was his option.
[time=2944] Some days, we like to feel like we are somebody's.
[time=2950] And that's when we get in the way of the gospel.
[time=2953] Instead of representing himself as a somebody, Paul said, "We were gentle among you."
[time=2961] We were like a mother caring for her children.
[time=2968] Christianity is not something that works by pushing others.
[time=2973] It works by pulling them.
[time=2976] Not by the ear, not by the tie, but by a magnetic, winsome gentleness that says, "Wow!"
[time=2987] If that's what Jesus Christ is like, I want to meet him.
[time=2992] The methods are gentle.
[time=2995] They're persuasive.
[time=2999] Please note that this is not a section on how to deal with church discipline.
[time=3004] You ought to see Paul go after a man in Corinth who was guilty of sexual immorality with his stepmother.
[time=3010] But you ought to hear what he says about I am Aeneas who made shipwreck his faith or how pointedly he talked about Demas who turned back.
[time=3019] There are times, even in the gospel, when we speak straight forward, sometimes hard words.
[time=3026] But when we're trying to present the gospel to the unchurched, to the lost, it's one of a gentle, gentle invitation.
[time=3038] It's just an anxious appeal, not a domineering spirit.
[time=3043] The third thing that he talks about in "Contagious Christianity" is what I'll call "prudent maintenance," verse 9.
[time=3053] Surely you remember, brothers, how our toil and our labor among you.
[time=3060] We worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preach the gospel to you.
[time=3067] All Paul is saying is this, maintaining the gospel message financially was a hardship.
[time=3076] And Paul said he had the option of taking up offerings, of passing the hat, but he chose not to do that.
[time=3084] What Paul did is he worked all day making tents and selling tents that he had enough money to live off so he could present the gospel and never take up an offering.
[time=3093] Would it have been appropriate for Paul to take up an offering? Yes, it would.
[time=3097] In Matthew 10-10, Jesus sent out the apostles.
[time=3101] And he said, "Don't take money with you, because the workman is worthy of his hire.
[time=3106] Where you go and you preach, they ought to pay you for the ministry you have." In 1 Timothy 5-18, the analogy is when an oxen is thrashing the grain and milling it for you.
[time=3117] And some grain falls on the ground, you let the oxen eat it, you don't muzzle the oxen, and you let those who work in the ministry eat of the ministry.
[time=3125] Paul had that option, but he'd made a different choice.
[time=3130] He chose to make tents, because he didn't want anybody to say, "Oh, Paul's just in it for the money."
[time=3137] Or, "I went to the church service at last in an hour, but forty-five minutes of it was the pitch for the offering."
[time=3145] Paul said, "We've got to have some prudence in our maintenance of the ministry."
[time=3152] As we operate the Bible, our television ministry, it's our purpose to say as little and preferably nothing about money,
[time=3160] because this is our outreach. This is not the old-fashioned fundraising hour.
[time=3165] It's an hour to share the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3169] You wouldn't think of going into your office and having the privilege of telling a guy or a woman next to you about the Lord and saying,
[time=3176] "Hey, I've got a little piece of paper here. We called a track, and this will review everything we've talked about.
[time=3181] Would you take it home and read it?" You would? Oh, great. Could you give me 75 cents to help pay for it?
[time=3188] We'd never do that.
[time=3191] Our outreach needs to be won. That's so prudent, so unoffensive, and the greatest stumbling block will always be money.
[time=3202] Again, this is talking about outreach. It's not talking about upkeep.
[time=3207] That's why it's our responsibility, who call a church home, to give regularly and systematically, so that a worship service is outreach,
[time=3215] so that missionaries can go to Japan like Mary Cruz. Our France, like the Lesperances, because there is that base of character in financial support
[time=3225] that we can be prudent in our outreach.
[time=3231] The fourth principle is a profound message.
[time=3238] Paul's message was profound in its walk, and it was profound.
[time=3244] In its talk.
[time=3247] Earlier, I had referred to some of the paper mill diplomas.
[time=3252] There's one institution in California that offers a doctorate of generosity degree.
[time=3259] All that you need to do is write out what you believe, send $10, and you'll receive your certificate as a doctor of generosity.
[time=3273] At the bottom of the degree, it has a Latin logo, a motto. It reads like this in Latin.
[time=3287] It sounds pretty impressive when it's in Latin. A free translation is, you may think you're something buster, but we really know you.
[time=3307] What's so profound about a degree? What's so profound about a profession?
[time=3313] Paul was there to say we aren't anything, but we've got a real message.
[time=3319] It is the message that Jesus Christ died for your sins.
[time=3324] Do you know what word he keeps repeating? It's the word gospel.
[time=3328] Chapter 2, verse 2, we declare to you the gospel. Chapter 2, verse 4, we presented to you the gospel.
[time=3339] Chapter 2, verse 8, the gospel. Chapter 2, verse 9, it is the gospel.
[time=3345] The gospel is the good announcement. The good news.
[time=3351] Paul said we lived among you. We were holy. We walked what we talked and we declared to you Jesus Christ that he has died on the cross for our sins.
[time=3362] That he has risen again and you today, every debt that you've had morally, every debt that you've had spiritually, every sin that has to been paid for, Jesus paid it all.
[time=3377] There is a new song called Beaky Glat. It captures this so well for me. I share it with you.
[time=3386] In these days of confused situations, in these nights of restless remorse, when the heart and the soul of the nation lay wounded and cold as a corpse,
[time=3403] from the grave of the innocent Adam, comes a song bringing joy to the sad.
[time=3410] Oh, your cry has been heard in the ransom. Has been paid up in full. Beaky Glat. Oh, be glad. Beaky Glat. Be glad.
[time=3424] Every debt that you ever had has been paid up in full by the grace of the Lord. Beaky Glat. Beaky Glat.
[time=3437] Paul said we've got a profound message to declare. It's not just a message of how you can make a little more money or how you can raise your kids a little better or how you can find happiness at the end of the rainbow.
[time=3449] It's a message that said every debt that you've ever had. It's been paid up in full.
[time=3455] Do you realize that today in heaven there's a ledger that has everything you've ever done wrong listed?
[time=3462] It has every vile thing you've ever spoken. It has no the very unkind word and has a recording of every thought you've ever had.
[time=3472] And at the end of it all, there's a message that says Jesus has paid the ransom in full. Beaky Glat.
[time=3483] Oh, beloved today, would you know the joy and the gladness of giving your heart to Jesus Christ? Beaky Glat.
[time=3493] Oh, fuck.
[time=3505] Once again, it's been our privilege to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, the handbell choir and soloist, Kathy Hawks.
[time=3513] The message today was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3516] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3524] Will you bow and pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to this earth to die for my sins.
[time=3535] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to come in and cleanse me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3543] To be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3550] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us of your decision?
[time=3554] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3563] To receive a copy of your decision, or the pamphlet mentioned earlier entitled "Closer Walk", please write to the Bible Hour.
