[time=90] [DING] 400 years before Christ was born,
[time=115] the great Greek philosopher Socrates purposefully took his own life.
[time=121] He gathered his disciples, his students, around him.
[time=124] Then in front of them, he prepared the poison hemlock.
[time=128] Before he took the potion, one of his students asked, "Master, will we live again?" And Socrates bewildered, said, "I can only hope so.
[time=141] No man can know." In sharp contrast, Jesus Christ willingly gave his life on the cross, announced that he would rise again and said, "Because I live, you, too, shall live."
[time=177] [MUSIC]
[time=207] With the trumpet fanfare and orchestra calling us, we've come to this place to worship today.
[time=215] We've gathered because this is the day that we remember that Jesus Christ arose from the grave.
[time=222] Out of the tradition of history comes many legends, but this is fact today, that there were those who went to a tomb anticipating a body, and the stone was rolled away, and he had arisen just as he said.
[time=236] And we welcome you today in the name of the risen Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=241] We welcome you to this worship service.
[time=243] We also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=248] It's not a fable.
[time=250] It's a fact.
[time=251] It's not tradition.
[time=252] It's history.
[time=253] That Jesus Christ is alive.
[time=255] And we invite you to take your hymn book and to turn to hymn 215, and to sing with us a brief service of singing that will go over the next three hymns.
[time=266] We enjoy that opportunity of saying hallelujah.
[time=270] He has risen.

[time=682] Let's remain standing, pray together.
[time=684] Our Father in heaven, every morning, we're thankful that you
[time=692] have provided a way for us to be saved.
[time=697] Every morning, we see around us Lord your creation.
[time=701] And we're in awe of you.
[time=702] And we bow before you now, admitting that we know you are God, and we are man.
[time=708] And therefore, we need to bow down before you and humble ourselves under your mighty hand, that you might lift us up in due time.
[time=715] God, we love you.
[time=717] And this morning, we respond to you because of what you've done for us.
[time=721] We're not trying to earn our way to your heaven, Lord, by being here.
[time=726] But we do bow down before you and worship you because you have provided a way.
[time=730] And since Jesus Christ has died for our sins, therefore an obedience, we bow before you and do your will.
[time=738] We love you this morning and thank you that we can join together.
[time=741] And today, we not only are thankful for the death of Jesus, but greater than that, even this morning on Easter, we're thankful for the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that we have hope forever.
[time=751] And this morning, collectively, we just bow before you and tell you that we love you.
[time=755] And we're grateful for the hope that we have in Christ.
[time=758] In His name I pray, amen.
[time=759] [MUSIC]
[time=769] Last night, I lay a sleeping, there came a dream so fair.
[time=784] I stood in old Jerusalem beside the temple room.
[time=793] I heard the children singing, and ever as they sang.
[time=802] I thought the voice of angels from heaven in answering.
[time=827] Jerusalem, Jerusalem, lift up the gates and sing.
[time=842] Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest.
[time=857] And then I thought my dream was changed.
[time=875] The streets no longer rang, hushed with a glad Hosanna's.
[time=884] The little children sang, the sky grew dark with mystery.
[time=894] The moon was cold and chill, as the shadow of a cross arose,
[time=905] upon a lonely hill, as the shadow of a cross arose,
[time=919] upon a lonely hill.
[time=928] [MUSIC]
[time=949] And once again, the sea was changed,
[time=977] to earth a seal to bring.
[time=982] I saw the holy city, beside the tideless sea.
[time=992] The light of God was on its streets.
[time=997] The gates were opened wide, and all who would fight and tear.
[time=1009] And no one was denied.
[time=1017] No need alone, no stars by night, or sun to shine by day.
[time=1031] It was the new general solemn, that would not pass away.
[time=1045] It was the night of the sun, that would not pass away.
[time=1119] [MUSIC]
[time=1120] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1122] [MUSIC]
[time=1150] In for the kingdom you were the king, when there was nothing,
[time=1170] you were everything.
[time=1173] In for foundation stood, before evil or good,
[time=1179] you were forever, before the night, before the day,
[time=1190] before the man was from play, before like before death,
[time=1198] before the first breath, you were forever,
[time=1206] forever king, your everything, my heart has needed to know.
[time=1216] My first, my last, my future, my last, the strength of all my hope, to the rock of all the ages.
[time=1231] It turned the time to save you, forever king, your everything,
[time=1241] forever.
[time=1243] [MUSIC - 6 seconds]
[time=1258] After the stars desert the sky, after the rivers all run dry,
[time=1267] when the earth gets no more, and the heavens roar, will be forever, and keep them gathered around your throne
[time=1284] of every nation of your own, and in part and more,
[time=1291] will praise your glory for ever, and ever, and ever.
[time=1302] You are ever king, your everything, my heart has needed
[time=1313] to know, forever, and my first, my last, my future, my last,
[time=1320] the strength of all my hope, to the rock of all the ages.
[time=1331] It turned the time to save you, forever king, your everything,
[time=1341] forever, and ever, and ever, and the rock of all the ages.
[time=1357] It turned the time to save you, forever king, your everything,
[time=1371] to the rock of ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever,
[time=1383] and ever king, your everything, forever.
[time=1401] Again, it's our privilege to welcome you to the Bible
[time=1407] Hour, here today at Black Hawk, it's Easter Sunday morning, and I hope your family has a great celebration.
[time=1414] Well, Rick, the weather is certainly cooperating this Easter season, and we're looking forward to having our family with us, worshiping together, and then we'll come together for a meal after church.
[time=1425] Well, that's a good tradition, and we're doing the same thing.
[time=1427] We've got in-laws and outlaws in from out of town, and here to celebrate Easter together.
[time=1432] A part of our highlight this Easter weekend was the Good Friday service, where we met many people.
[time=1438] Well, Rick, that was a great time to go down to the Grand Wayne, and not only see our own people come and support it, but a lot of the Bible Hour viewers were there.
[time=1446] I saw several that mentioned that they had sent in surveys and that they had responded to some of the invitations to write in that we had given through TV.
[time=1455] Well, speaking of the survey, many of you did return the survey, as we had asked you to.
[time=1461] We wanted to share with you the conclusions of that survey.
[time=1464] The vast majority of people who responded said, "Here in Fort Wayne, the best time for them to watch the Bible Hour is the time it's presently being aired at 7 o'clock Sunday morning, so you can keep tuned to this station and this time here in Fort Wayne to enjoy the Bible Hour." But that's not enough for a spiritual life, one brief hour of television ministry.
[time=1486] Of course, we want to encourage as many of you as humanly can to get out and to go to church in person.
[time=1493] And then to supplement church worship with daily Bible study.
[time=1498] And that's why we offer you the booklet, A Closer Walk.
[time=1502] It's designed to help each of us do just what it's titled.
[time=1505] They have a closer walk with God.
[time=1508] In many ways, a Sunday morning message is like being spoon fed.
[time=1512] When do you take out your own knife, fork, and spoon and dig into the meat of God's Word?
[time=1517] Well, closer walk will help you do that.
[time=1520] It will guide you through the New Testament and then it will give you practical insights to help you apply what you've just read.
[time=1527] What a difference God's Word makes in our lives when we apply it daily.
[time=1532] We'd love to send you a copy if you'll simply write and ask us to do so.
[time=1537] - You can receive The Closer Walk by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1544] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1547] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1556] - Thank you.
[time=1557] Pete, just a few weeks ago, I had the privilege of speaking at a Bible conference in South Whitley.
[time=1562] And there I got to meet really dozens of Bible Hour viewers.
[time=1566] Young people, older people, many of you took the time to come and to tell me how much you appreciated this ministry.
[time=1574] But Pete, the highlight for me was an older gentleman by the name of Frank.
[time=1578] He came three of the four nights and he was so open, so interested in spiritual things.
[time=1583] As he was leaving the last night, I said, "Frank, do you know Christ is your savior?" And he looked and he said, "I don't." And I asked what he liked to receive Christ and he said, "I sure would, but I don't know how." Well, that night, Frank accepted Christ as his savior.
[time=1599] It was the long ministry of the Bible.
[time=1601] He had been watching since Pastor Jeremiah was here.
[time=1604] That goes back eight or nine years.
[time=1606] Perhaps you would like to receive Christ, but you don't know how.
[time=1611] As this broadcast comes to an end today, Pete will take the microphone once again at the end of the message and he'll lead a simple prayer.
[time=1619] If you would like to receive the risen Christ as your savior, please listen carefully.
[time=1624] As Pete leads us in prayer and open up your heart to Christ.
[time=1627] Perhaps you're like my new friend, Frank.
[time=1630] You don't know how.
[time=1631] Pete will share with you how.
[time=1633] Before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to invite our friends to write again.
[time=1638] - We certainly encourage you to write and tell us that you're out there watching the Bible hour.
[time=1642] That's a great encouragement to us.
[time=1643] So write to us today at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1654] We look forward to hearing from you this week.
[time=1656] - Thanks, Pete.
[time=1657] And we really do look forward to your letters.
[time=1659] And so we hope you'll write.
[time=1661] Thank you again for being a part of the Bible hour here today on Easter.
[time=1666] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 299 seconds]
[time=1993] Thank you, Keith.
[time=1995] (audience applauds) That song starts with the path offs of describing the death of Christ.
[time=2005] Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
[time=2009] It builds in a crescendos with the resurrection.
[time=2012] Were you there when he rolls up from the grave?
[time=2015] Sometimes my heart wants to shout glory.
[time=2020] Could we break our rich tradition of sophistication this morning and just say that one word of praise, glory?
[time=2028] Would you say that with me now?
[time=2030] Glory, oh God today, we glorify you.
[time=2034] May the meditation of our hearts and the words of our mouths be acceptable in your sight.
[time=2042] Oh God, amen.
[time=2045] I would like to read for you this morning.
[time=2048] That story that is history, that tradition that is truth, though we read it each year on this occasion, how real it is.
[time=2059] Matthew's account of the resurrection of Christ, Matthew 28 verses one through 10.
[time=2066] After the Sabbath at dawn, on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
[time=2079] There was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[time=2090] His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow.
[time=2097] The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
[time=2105] The angel said to the women, do not be afraid for I know that you are looking for Jesus
[time=2114] who was crucified.
[time=2116] He is not here, he is risen just as he said.
[time=2122] Come and see the place where he lay.
[time=2126] Then they go quickly.
[time=2129] Then go quickly and tell his disciples.
[time=2131] He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you in the Galilee.
[time=2137] There you will see him.
[time=2140] Now I have told you.
[time=2141] So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy and ran to tell his disciples.
[time=2150] Suddenly Jesus met them.
[time=2153] Greetings, he said.
[time=2158] They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.
[time=2163] Then Jesus said to them, do not be afraid.
[time=2167] Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee and there they will see me.
[time=2174] I'd like to invite you to bow with me that we might pray together.
[time=2179] Our God and Father, we bow before you today and we marvel at your love.
[time=2185] We marvel to think that we were there, not really, but our sins were when Jesus died on the cross.
[time=2194] I stand in remorse and sure grand when I realize
[time=2200] it was my sin, my inappropriate words, my hostile thoughts that nailed him to the cross.
[time=2215] We today come collectively to ask your forgiveness for our sins of apathy and indifference, our forthright rebellion.
[time=2225] We've come to ask you to cleanse us and to wash us not because of us, but because of Jesus, not just for our sake, but for his sake.
[time=2236] And we ask you to invigorate us and give us a vitality, born out of a confidence that he is alive and so today we ask you to speak to our hearts.
[time=2248] To those of us who are believers that we might be renewed in our commitment to walk in obedience, to those who are searching that they might be convinced, not by the words of a person, but by the power of your spirit, that Jesus Christ is both Lord and God, for it's in his name that we pray, amen.
[time=2270] Socrates chose to take his own life.
[time=2274] The selection was poison hemlock.
[time=2278] He gathered his students, his disciples around him, to give them final words of instruction.
[time=2285] And then he held the poison in his hand.
[time=2288] And before he took it to his mouth, one of his disciples asked, "Teacher, will we live again?" Socrates responded, "I can only hope so.
[time=2302] "No man can know for certain." And he drank the hemlock and died.
[time=2309] In sharp contrast to a defeated philosopher who was uncertain of eternity, we meet Jesus, who boldly says, "No man takes my life, "but I lay it down of myself, "and if I lay it down, I will raise it up again." Who said, "Yes, these things have I written unto you "that you may know that you have eternal life." We come here today to celebrate two things that Jesus Christ is alive, and that because he lives, he said, "We too shall live." We're studying through the book of first Thessalonians, and I invite you to find first Thessalonians chapter one.
[time=2355] The focus of our study is on a few phrases out of verse 10.
[time=2359] First Thessalonians verse chapter one, verse nine,
[time=2365] tells how this group of people turned away from false gods and false religions, and they turned to Jesus Christ.
[time=2373] And in verse 10 it says, "And to wait for his son from heaven, "whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, "who rescues us from the coming wrath." I would like to introduce you this morning to Jesus Christ, who is described here in three ways.
[time=2394] He is the risen Lord, he's the returning Lord, and he is the reigning Lord.
[time=2401] Paul said to this group of people, as he said more than any other person in the page of scriptures, Jesus Christ is the risen Lord.
[time=2409] They were waiting looking for Jesus, whom God raised from the dead.
[time=2416] Well, you've come this morning, and you know that it's Easter tradition to have lilies, a cross, a choir, and to talk about the resurrection.
[time=2424] But why is that word resurrection so important?
[time=2428] Why is it that in this passage and so many others, Paul comes to the fact that Jesus Christ was risen from the dead?
[time=2438] Well, let's look this morning at the resurrection.
[time=2440] First, its purposes, and then its proofs.
[time=2444] The Bible spells out many purposes for the resurrection.
[time=2448] These three, first of all, the resurrection has this purpose.
[time=2453] It was the proof that Jesus was who he said he was, for Jesus claimed to be Lord and God.
[time=2462] That is not totally unusable in history.
[time=2467] People in Jesus' day, before his and since then, have claimed to be God.
[time=2473] Some of them were deceivers, others of them were deceived by themselves.
[time=2480] That reminds me of a story of a young pastor who went visiting in a hospital, and he went to visit a man in his church who was suffering from delusion.
[time=2487] And he said to the man, "Hi, what's your name?" The man said, "I am Napoleon Bonaparte." A young pastor was taken back by this and reasoned with the guy and asked him again, "Who are you?" And the man put his hand inside his coat and said, "I am Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France and all of Europe." A young pastor wasn't real gifted in these areas, but he came up with a plan on the spur of the moment.
[time=2514] So he asked the man, "Who said that you are Napoleon Bonaparte?" Man looked puzzled and finally said, "Well, God did." The man in the next bed said, "No, I didn't." (audience laughing) Well, there have always been people in history who have claimed to be God.
[time=2534] Some of them were self-deceived, others were purposeful deceivers, and does Jesus fit into either one of those groups?
[time=2541] Was he self-deceived, or was he deliberately deceiving others?
[time=2547] The question was asked, "Jesus, "by coming into this temple and cleansing it, "you're claiming to be the Messiah.
[time=2554] "What proof do you have?" Jesus said, "Destroy this temple, "and in three days I'll build it up again." Three days.
[time=2565] It took our fathers 40 years to build this structure.
[time=2569] How can you say in three days you'll build it up?
[time=2572] They didn't know he meant the temple of his body, or did they?
[time=2579] Well, you see, three years later when Jesus is arrested and crucified and put in a borrowed grave, always borrow something you're not gonna use for long, then these guys remembered.
[time=2592] They said, "Ah, wait a minute.
[time=2594] "We remember," and here's what they said, that that deceiver, that's how they considered Christ, that that deceiver, when he was alive, said that he'd rise again.
[time=2603] They ran off the pilot, begged him for a guard, and the military guard was placed at the tomb, because they did understand.
[time=2612] They did remember that he said, "I'll prove I'm God, I'll rise again." And they gave themselves the insurance of a military guard.
[time=2620] In another passage, Jesus was performing miracles and casting out demons and forgiving people's sins, and he was acting like God, and then he claimed to be God, and they said, "Wait a minute.
[time=2631] "What proof do you have?" Jesus said as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, and rise again.
[time=2648] The resurrection is the proof that Jesus Christ was God.
[time=2656] But it had a second purpose.
[time=2658] It was also the proof that his death was acceptable for your sins and for mine.
[time=2666] Charles Haddon Spurgeon, the great English preacher of a century ago, wrote these words.
[time=2674] "Jesus stands in the sinner's stead and dies.
[time=2679] "When he has done that, "nothing more can be demanded of him.
[time=2685] "For he that is dead is free from the law.
[time=2689] "You can take a man who has been guilty "of a capital offense.
[time=2693] "He is condemned to be hanged, "and he is hanged by the neck till he is dead.
[time=2699] "What more has the law to do with him?
[time=2701] "It is done with him, "for it has executed his sentence upon him.
[time=2706] "If he can be brought back to life again, "he is clear from the law." Spurgeon was arguing, as Paul had argued before him, that Jesus died for our sins.
[time=2721] That was the demand of God's law.
[time=2723] The wages of sin is death, and Jesus died for our sins because he possessed two qualities that none of us possess.
[time=2732] One, he was sinless.
[time=2735] You see, if Jesus was a sinner, he could only die for his own sins, not for yours, not for mine, certainly not for the world.
[time=2743] The second quality that he possessed was he was not only sinless, but he was eternal.
[time=2749] For if he could have been just a sinless man, then he could have died for your sins, but not mine.
[time=2759] Or he could have died for mine, but not yours because his death would have been finite.
[time=2764] It would have been limited, but he was eternal.
[time=2768] And so his death, pardon the irony, was an infinite death that was big enough, broad enough to cover the sins of the world.
[time=2779] And how do we know that that sin was covered?
[time=2783] Because God says he has died and is proof that was accepted.
[time=2788] I'll raise him from the dead.
[time=2791] The third reason for the resurrection is that it is also proof of our eternal life.
[time=2799] Against the invasion of the Muslims,
[time=2809] all of Europe began to quake.
[time=2811] Could they stop the Moors that had crossed the Straits of Gibraltar?
[time=2815] An army was launched and went into battle and they had a courageous leader, his name, El Sid.
[time=2822] But in the heat of the battle, El Sid was wounded and he died.
[time=2827] But in order to muster the army together, they took the body of El Sid and they put it on his horse and they tied his hands to the saddle and they ran aboard behind his jacket to hold him up.
[time=2839] And proudly, they marched into battle behind a dead man.
[time=2844] Are we simply living our lives,
[time=2851] marching behind the dead El Sid of the New Testament?
[time=2856] No, we're not.
[time=2858] Jesus Christ was dead, but he has risen and he's alive.
[time=2863] And that's our proof that we serve a living king and he has a living kingdom.
[time=2870] The resurrection of Jesus Christ is what allows us to hope in the midst of sorrow.
[time=2875] It's what allows us to grieve, but not as others who have no hope.
[time=2880] Oh, as I look out in his auditorium, I see so many of you who since we met last Easter had buried loved ones.
[time=2888] Jim has lost his sister.
[time=2890] June has lost her husband.
[time=2893] How do we cope with that loss?
[time=2895] Because we are not Socrates who says, I can only hope so, but no man can know.
[time=2901] We are believers in Jesus Christ.
[time=2903] We can say, I know because Jesus said, because I live you too, shall live.
[time=2910] That's the purpose of the resurrection.
[time=2914] That's why we announce it so boldly.
[time=2916] It's the proof that he was God.
[time=2920] It was the proof that his sacrifice was acceptable.
[time=2923] It's our proof that heaven and eternal life is real.
[time=2926] But what proof do we have that he literally arose from the grave?
[time=2933] There have been those who have reviewed the history and the documents are too numerous and too trustworthy to be refuted.
[time=2942] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 that he saw Jesus, Peter saw Jesus, 10 other disciples saw Jesus and then he said in 500 people saw him at one time.
[time=2954] So convincing are the documents and the evidence that even critics no longer try to dismiss the documents.
[time=2961] What they try to say is the documents were written by people who were deceivers, hence the notion of a Passover plot that the disciples record is impeccable.
[time=2974] They actually wrote these, but maybe they lied when they wrote them.
[time=2980] Maybe they had just orchestrated a plot where they had captured that dead body, stolen it away and hid it, and then went out and perpetrated the fable that he had actually risen again.
[time=2992] One of the greatest arguments against that I believe is the one penned by Charles Colson in his book Loving God.
[time=3000] He draws an analogy, if you'll pardon this, between the resurrection and Watergate.
[time=3007] He makes these points of comparison.
[time=3011] In the resurrection, the principal characters are lowly, uneducated, humble disciples who were fishermen, tax collectors and the unemployed of the society of Jesus' day.
[time=3023] The co-conspirators in Watergate were chief of staff,
[time=3029] special counsel to the president, attorney general, head of the National Security Council.
[time=3036] They were the most powerful men in the world.
[time=3039] Colson said anytime he wanted that he could pick up a phone and order a limousine with as many secret service men as he wanted.
[time=3046] Colson makes this second comparison.
[time=3051] These men had nothing to cover up.
[time=3054] For if Jesus was dead, he was dead and it was one less carpenter in Jerusalem.
[time=3059] These men had everything to cover up.
[time=3061] They were seeking to protect the Oval Office, the most powerful position on the world.
[time=3068] Colson makes another distinction.
[time=3072] These disciples, if they were caught in their plot, would be surely executed.
[time=3078] These co-conspirators in Watergate, if they were caught, were subject to loss of reputation and a brief sentencing in prison.
[time=3090] Then Colson makes this point.
[time=3094] These co-conspirators were not able to keep the Watergate cover up going from longer than March the 21st, 1973 until April the 8th of the same year.
[time=3106] Three brief weeks.
[time=3108] And then Colson said then everyone ran for cover to protect themselves.
[time=3113] Then Colson argues how is it that we can believe that these humble fishermen and common men of society with nothing to gain but death, conspired together to steal a body, hid the body and spent 50 years of their life and each of them dying for the Passover plot.
[time=3131] It's the most untenable theory in history.
[time=3135] The evidence is overwhelming.
[time=3138] The documents are historical and they're historically accurate.
[time=3144] Jesus Christ is the risen Lord.
[time=3148] Secondly, in first Thessalonians he's depicted as the returning Lord.
[time=3153] After Christ arose from the grave he spent 40 days with his disciples, teaching them, training them, preparing them and then he took them outside the city.
[time=3164] He lifted up his hands and he ascended into heaven.
[time=3168] When he was gone an angel appeared and said, "Men of Galilee, why stand ye here idly gazing into the sky?
[time=3177] This same Jesus who was taken from among you will come again in a like manner as you have seen him go." From that very moment on the disciples were filled with the confidence that Jesus was coming again.
[time=3192] And so this passage says that this group of Thessalonian disciples, they were waiting for the return of Jesus from heaven.
[time=3203] That is the blessed hope of the church.
[time=3207] For when he returns he is coming to rescue us.
[time=3211] Jesus rescues us in three ways.
[time=3214] First of all, he rescues us from the penalty of sin, eternal death.
[time=3220] But secondly as this passage refers, Jesus rescues us from the coming wrath.
[time=3226] God's wrath is being stored up.
[time=3230] He is gracious, he is forbearing and he's bidding you and you and you and you come to me.
[time=3237] While there is still time come to me.
[time=3241] And then there's coming a day when Jesus will come for all who believe just before God pours out his wrath in seven years of tribulation on this earth.
[time=3252] And Jesus said, I'm raised so that I can rescue you from sin and death and I can rescue my church from the tribulation.
[time=3260] Jesus is coming to rescue us from the wrath that is to come.
[time=3265] Maybe it won't be for another hundred or another thousand years, but he'll rescue us from the immediate wrath of sin and death.
[time=3275] The third thing that Jesus rescues us is from the burdens of life.
[time=3281] He said, all that you will come into me, try my yoke, it is easy and my burden is light.
[time=3288] He tells us how much he cares for us.
[time=3291] Someone gave me a plaque that speaks so clearly how Jesus cares about us.
[time=3296] Oh, he doesn't promise to change our circumstances.
[time=3299] He only promises to walk with us through those hard valleys.
[time=3303] It's a letter, reads, dear friend, how are you?
[time=3307] I just had to send you a note to tell you how much I love you.
[time=3311] I saw you yesterday as you were walking with your friends.
[time=3315] I waited all day hoping you'd want to talk to me too.
[time=3319] As evening drew near I gave you a sunset to close out your day and a cool breeze to rest you.
[time=3326] And I waited, but you never came.
[time=3330] Oh yes, it hurts me, but I still love you because I'm your friend.
[time=3337] I saw you fall asleep last night.
[time=3340] I longed to touch your brow.
[time=3343] So I spilled out moonlight upon your pillow and face.
[time=3346] Again, I waited wanting to rush down so we could talk.
[time=3351] I have so much I want to tell you, then you're waking and rushed off to work.
[time=3356] My tears were in the rain.
[time=3358] Today you look so sad, so all alone.
[time=3362] It makes my heart ache because I understand how you feel.
[time=3366] My friends let me down many times, but I still love you.
[time=3371] Oh, if you would only listen to me, I love you.
[time=3378] I tell it to you in the blue skies and in the quiet green grass.
[time=3383] I whisper it in the leaves on the trees and breathe it into the colors of the flowers.
[time=3388] I shout it to you in the mountain streams and give the birds love songs to sing.
[time=3393] I clothed you with warm sunshine and perfume the air with natural scents.
[time=3398] My love for you is deeper than the ocean, higher than the mountains, bigger than the biggest need or longing of your heart.
[time=3405] Oh, I love you.
[time=3407] If you only knew how much I longed to walk with you and to talk with you, we could spend eternity together in heaven.
[time=3415] I know how hard it is down here on earth.
[time=3419] Yes, I really know and I want so much to help you.
[time=3423] I want you to meet my father.
[time=3424] He loves you too and wants to help you.
[time=3427] You know my father's that way.
[time=3429] Just call me, ask me.
[time=3432] I have so much to share with you.
[time=3435] I don't want to bother you anymore because you're free to choose.
[time=3438] It's your decision.
[time=3440] I've already chosen you.
[time=3442] And because of this, I will wait because I love you.
[time=3448] You know, Jesus loves you today.
[time=3451] He wants to rescue you from the burdens of life.
[time=3454] Oh, in this case, he's not going to rapture you and take you out.
[time=3457] But he says, I'll walk with you because I love you.
[time=3461] Thirdly and finally, he's not only the risen Lord and the returning Lord, he is the reigning Lord.
[time=3467] He is coming from heaven where he is seated at the right hand of God and he reigns overall, except for perhaps your heart.
[time=3477] While we decide, he reigns.
[time=3484] When we choose wisely, he reigns when we choose foolishly.
[time=3489] He reigns while we serve him, he reigns while we rebel against him, he reigns.
[time=3497] What will you do with Jesus?
[time=3500] Neutral, you cannot be.
[time=3502] Someday, your heart will be asking, what will Jesus do with me?
[time=3508] We've been sharing with you the music of our sanctuary choir
[time=3519] and orchestra and soloist Keith Brodigam.
[time=3523] The message today was about the resurrection from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3527] Earlier in the broadcast, we talked about receiving Jesus Christ as your personal savior.
[time=3533] You can do that right now by bowing your heads and praying this prayer with me.
[time=3537] Will you bow with me?
[time=3538] Dear heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3547] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3550] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come in and be my savior today.
[time=3556] In Jesus' name, I pray, amen.
[time=3559] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us?
[time=3563] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
