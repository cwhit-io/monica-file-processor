[time=113] In 1836, the island of Madagascar was closed to missionaries
[time=119] and Bibles were burned.
[time=121] Anyone caught with a Bible or reading a Bible was subject to severe persecution and even death.
[time=129] The question was, could Christianity survive such persecution?
[time=135] Twenty-five years later, the island country was opened again to missionaries in the Bible.
[time=141] They not only found that Christianity could survive, but it was actually thriving.
[time=147] In those twenty-five years of persecution and seclusion, Christianity grew seven times over.
[time=156] It not only survived, but it thrived.
[time=160] [MUSIC]
[time=173] Welcome to an hour of Bible study and use it in fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=177] Thank you for joining us.
[time=179] Driving in the Christian life is the title of Rick's message today.
[time=183] Problems and persecution are an inevitable part of life, but they do not necessarily keep us from advancing in our Christian walk.
[time=190] In fact, they may be the very thing that causes us to grow.
[time=193] Like an athlete who is spent, or the musician who is exhausted, the painful exercise produces growth.
[time=200] Study with us from first Thessalonians on how to maintain your stride in the race and thrive in the Christian life.
[time=208] The sinks will require an orchestra will be ministering to us with music.
[time=213] Other special music includes a duet from Marilyn Wong and Ed Richard, and an instrumental solo from David Johnson.
[time=223] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=231] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=236] Now, here's Rick.
[time=238] To strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ, we also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible hour.
[time=246] We've come together today to worship the Lord and to praise the name of Jesus.
[time=250] As the choir leads us, it tells us our purpose, all hail the power of Jesus' name.
[time=280] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=405] We continue with that crowning him, Lord of all, and the theme this morning of victory in Jesus Christ our Savior.
[time=412] 473, oh victory in Jesus my Savior forever.
[time=417] Him number 473.
[time=420] [MUSIC - 209 seconds]
[time=651] Thank you very much for your good sing. The Lord indeed gives us the victory through Jesus Christ.
[time=657] Well listen now as we continue with music as Marilyn Wong and Ed Richards sing for us.
[time=663] [MUSIC]
[time=677] His eyes follow the sparrow to the ground, follow the road to where we're bound.
[time=691] They search when we're lost until we're fine.
[time=701] His eyes see to the flower in the field.
[time=709] They see through each envelope we've sealed.
[time=715] They see through the strongest walls we build.
[time=725] Oh may I be pleasing to see, when the holy eyes gaze upon me.
[time=737] Oh may I be pleasing to see.
[time=744] His eyes see through the deepest darkest night.
[time=765] He feet into my heart and soul their sight.
[time=771] They turn from the wrong to all that's right.
[time=781] And his eyes look from a throne of love and grace.
[time=789] Look through the rim of time and space to find in our heart each secret place.
[time=805] Oh may I be pleasing to see, when the holy eyes gaze upon me.
[time=817] Oh may I be pleasing to see, in his eyes.
[time=829] Oh may I be pleasing to see, when the holy eyes gaze upon me.
[time=841] Oh may I be pleasing to see, in his eyes.
[time=857] Oh may I be pleasing to see, when the holy eyes gaze upon me.
[time=873] Well this spring break here in Fort Wayne, Indiana and many people are gone.
[time=878] I started to say but at least you and I are here, Pete and I realized you're leaving today.
[time=882] Well we're going to take a little bit of a break but we are here for this Sunday morning but as has been tradition in the past we've had young people leaving about this time on Operation Outreach. You in fact have been involved in that several times.
[time=895] Well I looked at the bus with a little bit of a jealous eye Friday.
[time=898] We have a group of high school students who are on their way to Florida.
[time=902] Actually they're there by now and they'll spend the week on the beaches of Florida sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ with people.
[time=910] We've been doing this for about 11 years and have had tremendous success of doing two things.
[time=915] One is leading people to Christ there and then secondly building a generation of young people who will become lifelong ambassadors for Christ.
[time=924] Well I see the confidence with which they come back and I think that helps them in their everyday situation in the classroom and their schools, wherever they are to share with their friends after they've had this experience down in Florida.
[time=937] Well again I was a little jealous but we'll stay here and pray for that ministry.
[time=942] We share Operation Outreach with you so that you'll know of some of the high school and youth ministries here at Black Hawk and we have some dynamic children's ministries as well.
[time=951] Coming up is the King's Kids Musical.
[time=953] I reckon the springtime we look forward to the children's musicals.
[time=957] I've listened to this one a number of times since my wife is involved but this is the King's Kids presenting a musical on April 30th at 6 p.m. here in our church.
[time=966] Rick it's entitled "The Bible Tells Me So Show" and it has a great contest really but while the kids are preparing this musical, they're learning a lot of answers to questions of events that took place in the Word of God.
[time=980] So it's going to be a fun time and yet it's a learning experience for the kids too.
[time=984] Well it is both because our two girls Rachel and Rebecca are doing just what you've said.
[time=988] They've been learning but they've been having fun as well.
[time=991] That's great.
[time=992] Well we wanted you to know about some of the youth and children's ministry.
[time=995] If you're in the greater Fort Wayne area, Black Hawk is a church that has a balanced ministry to all segments of society and the family.
[time=1003] We just wanted you to know of some of the things going on here at Black Hawk.
[time=1007] Today we have a book to share with you and called "Approaching Hoofbeats".
[time=1012] It's written by a man who needs no introduction to any of us, Dr. Billy Graham.
[time=1017] This book is also called "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse".
[time=1021] Many of you will recognize both of those titles as a reference to the book of Revelation.
[time=1027] God's timetable for the end times.
[time=1030] We're sharing it with you now during the month of April.
[time=1033] Because in the next few weeks as we study through 1 Thessalonians, we're going to come to two significant chapters.
[time=1040] Chapter 4 which talks about the rapture when Jesus Christ comes to the air and raptures the church out.
[time=1047] And then in chapter 5, some of the events of the tribulation that will follow.
[time=1052] Well, Dr. Graham's book is an excellent bestseller, and we were able to get a large number of copies so that we could share them with you.
[time=1061] And we'd love to send you this booklet that will explain in practical everyday language, God's timetable for the end times.
[time=1070] If you would like a copy, you simply need to write to us and ask it and we'll send you one free.
[time=1076] There are some significant events coming up in the life of the Christian world, and we want you to know about them.
[time=1082] You can receive this book by writing to the Bible Hour.
[time=1085] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1089] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1092] Once again, that's the Bible Hour.
[time=1095] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1098] 46815.
[time=1101] Thank you, Pete, and we do hope you'll write for Dr. Graham's book.
[time=1105] And we'd love to hear from you, even if you don't need a copy or already have one.
[time=1110] It's such an encouragement for us to hear from friends like you who join us week by week for the Bible Hour.
[time=1118] I had the privilege of speaking in a rural church over the past few weeks, and what did the light it was to meet literally dozens of people who introduced themselves and jokingly said, "You don't know me, but I know you.
[time=1131] We have breakfast together every Sunday morning." I know by that they met, they watched the Bible Hour at 7 o'clock here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1139] We would be so grateful if you were to write to us so that we could know of the ministry of this television broadcast in your life.
[time=1146] So, Peter, would you share the address one more time?
[time=1149] Let me encourage you to write to the Bible Hour today.
[time=1152] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1156] And the zip code is 46815.
[time=1159] Thanks, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today.
[time=1162] We hope that you'll open up your heart and open up your Bible that we can study God's Word together as we learn how to thrive in the Christian life.
[time=1189] [MUSIC - 107 seconds]
[time=1306] Thank you, David. David always plays so well.
[time=1310] Whether it's a joyful time or a time of adversity.
[time=1314] And this week has been both for him.
[time=1316] He had the great joy of a baby boy being born.
[time=1320] They had a little boy, ten pounder named Scott late this week.
[time=1325] Great joy, great adversity as Scott came home and kept mom and dad up until after two last night.
[time=1331] David plays well even without sleep.
[time=1334] I invite you to bow with me and pray together, but not sleep together.
[time=1339] Jesus said, "Watch and pray." Father, we come to you, and as David has played, we confess.
[time=1346] We need thee every hour.
[time=1349] No voice can afford the peace that you alone can give.
[time=1356] And so we've come today to hear your precious voice.
[time=1361] We ask you to speak to our spirit from your spirit.
[time=1366] We ask you to go beyond the rhetoric of a person, the words of a speaker,
[time=1372] and for your spirit to talk to us.
[time=1376] Give us a perspective on life that's bigger than our dollars, longer than our time.
[time=1383] Help us to see life and view of eternity and to know what really counts.
[time=1388] Help us today to cope with the pressures of life and to not be choked out by the cares of this world.
[time=1396] Help us to find a unique balance between being effective in our jobs and being committed to them too much.
[time=1405] Help us to find that unique point of balance with our family, where we are loving and providing,
[time=1412] but we can also give to others.
[time=1416] Help us to find a way to invest, not just our money, but our lives.
[time=1422] We would pray today that you would meet with us.
[time=1425] Use your word in the life of each believer at that believer's point of need.
[time=1432] We'd pray that you would encourage those who are discouraged because they've lost a job, no fault of their own.
[time=1440] They're looking at being replaced when they have much yet to give.
[time=1447] We pray that you would encourage those who are feeling the pain of past mistakes.
[time=1454] Help them to know that you forgive.
[time=1457] We ask you to encourage those who are going through the fracturing of a deep and meaningful relationship.
[time=1464] They've worked hard to maintain it, but it's been broken, and now so is their heart.
[time=1471] We ask you to encourage those today who have served you with their life, and they observe that those who have not served you are prospering, and they say, "Where's the fairness?"
[time=1482] We ask you to encourage those who have gifts but have never been asked to use them,
[time=1488] who have a word but have never been given a platform to speak it, who have a song but never an opportunity to sing.
[time=1496] Give to us an opportunity fitting with our gifts, fitting with our calling that would please you.
[time=1504] Thank you for the important work of the gift of helps us, ushers, greet people, make them feel wanted
[time=1511] and help them to enter a building that seems so different.
[time=1514] Thank you for the gift of helps as those hands gently care for our children even at this moment.
[time=1520] Thank you for the gift of helps that makes all the things that we take for granted and maintenance and technology run without a glitch.
[time=1529] Thank you for your help, and may we feel it working even in these moments.
[time=1536] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1540] Of all the Vsaups fables, probably the most famous is the story of the tortoise and the hare,
[time=1548] the rabbit who sized up his opponent the turtle and said, "I can beat this guy on any day."
[time=1555] The two of them took off and the rabbit immediately out-distance the turtle on his first hop and left him in the dust.
[time=1563] Methodically, the turtle plotted along.
[time=1567] The rabbit dashed into an even greater lead.
[time=1570] He had passed the tortoise by so far that he deserved a rest.
[time=1575] You know the story.
[time=1577] He took the rest, fell asleep in the shade for longer than he anticipated.
[time=1582] And in his sleep, the tortoise called past him and passed the finish line.
[time=1588] Illustrates a simple point.
[time=1591] It's not how well you start.
[time=1593] It's how well you finish that counts.
[time=1597] The Bible continually likens our spiritual lives to that of a race.
[time=1603] In Hebrews chapter 12, it says, "Seeing we're surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[time=1610] let us lay aside the sin that besets us and anything that entangles us,
[time=1617] and let us run the race that is set before us." Our Christian life is a race.
[time=1623] In 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 Paul says, "All they who run in a race run to win,
[time=1629] so you run that you might win." Our Christian life is like a race.
[time=1637] And like Esau's fable, it's not how well you start that counts.
[time=1642] It's how well you finish.
[time=1644] If you have a Bible, we invite you to study with us from the book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=1649] If you're not familiar, it's in the New Testament and there will be a table of contents in the front of your Bible.
[time=1656] Take the time to look it up so that you can follow along as we study God's Word today.
[time=1664] Out of 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and chapter 3, Paul reflects on how well the Thessalonians Christians are running.
[time=1674] He's been separated from them and he's concerned whether they're surviving in this race.
[time=1680] And he's joyfully surprised to learn they're not only surviving, but they're actually thriving in their Christian life.
[time=1690] Let me give you a very simple outline so you can follow where we're going.
[time=1695] Chapter 2 verses 13 through 17 talks about a superb start.
[time=1704] This group of Christians were off in their race and they had a superb start.
[time=1708] Chapter 2 verses 13 and 14 and 15.
[time=1715] In verses 17 through 20, they suffer a severe setback.
[time=1724] And then in chapter 3 verses 1 through 13, they develop a steady stride.
[time=1730] Chapter 2 verse 13. And we also thank God continually because when you received the Word of God,
[time=1739] which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the Word of men, but as it actually is the Word of God,
[time=1749] which is at work in you who believe.
[time=1753] For you brothers became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus.
[time=1760] You suffered from your countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews who killed the Lord Jesus
[time=1768] and the prophets and also drove us out.
[time=1773] They displeased God and are hostile to all men in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles
[time=1781] so that they may be saved.
[time=1785] In this way, they always heap upon their sins to the limit.
[time=1791] The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
[time=1796] Paul went to a church where there was no church.
[time=1801] There was no building, there were no people.
[time=1804] It was a city called Thessal and I can say this would be a great town to start a church.
[time=1808] He shared the gospel with a few people.
[time=1811] They came to Christ and they were off to a superb start.
[time=1817] He was taken away from them in two to three weeks time, but their start was grand.
[time=1824] In verses 13 through 16, he reflects back on this superb start that they had.
[time=1830] Like Ben Johnson out of the starting box at the Olympics, they were in the lead from the beginning.
[time=1836] Their superb start was characterized by two things.
[time=1840] One, they had received God's word and two, they had accepted adversity.
[time=1847] Look at verse 13, there are two words for received.
[time=1852] And we also thank God continually because when you received, there's our first word.
[time=1858] The word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it.
[time=1862] That's our second word.
[time=1864] The first word for received is somewhat of a neutral reception.
[time=1869] It doesn't speak to whether you were positively disposed or negatively disposed, you received it.
[time=1876] But the second word brings with it a connotation of a welcome, of a joyful reception.
[time=1884] It's like opening up the mail and expecting to find bills and lo and behold, you open up the mail and there it is back early.
[time=1893] A check from the United States government, you had a little tax money coming back.
[time=1897] You take that one a little bit better than you take the rest of the mail.
[time=1902] That's the second word received.
[time=1905] Not everything we receive, we receive joyfully.
[time=1908] My wife even showed me that birthday cards are not always an occasion for joy.
[time=1914] She found one last night, she couldn't decide who to send it to.
[time=1918] The better part of judgment said don't even buy it.
[time=1921] On the front of the cover it said I knew you were sensitive about your age, so I'm trying to steer conversation away from that and towards your weight.
[time=1930] That's a birthday card I'm not sure any of us would receive all that joyfully.
[time=1936] But there are things that come into our life and when we see them, we welcome them.
[time=1942] We open up our arms and our hearts and we take it in.
[time=1947] Like a family member who's been separated and they're finally coming home.
[time=1952] We've tied that yellow ribbon about the old oak tree and when we see them coming, we open up our arms and we take them in.
[time=1960] Paul said when you came to God's Word, you opened up your arms and you opened up your heart and you took it in.
[time=1967] You received and accepted God's Word.
[time=1971] And they did that in two ways.
[time=1973] First of all, they received it intellectually.
[time=1976] These people looked at the Bible, the message of Paul and they evaluated it intellectually
[time=1983] and they said is this the words of Paul, of a man, or is this literally the message
[time=1992] and the word of God?
[time=1996] And as they evaluated it, they came to the conclusion, this is God's Word.
[time=2003] Oh sure, people wrote it.
[time=2006] Paul wrote the book of 1 Thessalonians and several others.
[time=2010] John wrote the gospel that bears his name.
[time=2013] James wrote the epistle that is called James.
[time=2018] But as James or Paul or John or Mark or Luke wrote, they wrote with a language they understood.
[time=2027] They wrote with an insight born out of their culture.
[time=2031] They understood the history and the geography of their day.
[time=2036] But more than all that is they wrote, God's Holy Spirit superintended them, guarded and
[time=2044] guided them so that as they wrote with their own personality, they also wrote with the authority of God that it was his Word and he guided them and he guarded it so that there
[time=2056] was the entrance of air or mistruth, but it's actually the inherent authoritative word of
[time=2064] God that Paul spoke to them.
[time=2068] And these people evaluated it and they opened up their lives and they received it as God's
[time=2075] Word.
[time=2076] But more than that, they actually received it practically.
[time=2083] Look at the last phrase of verse 13.
[time=2085] You received it as the Word of God, which is at work in you who believe.
[time=2094] Bill Gaither sings a song that says, "I hear you've been getting into the Word." And as Christians, we're big on getting into the Word.
[time=2102] That's why we read it here and we encourage you to memorize it.
[time=2105] But the song goes on to say, "I hear you've been getting into the Word, but is the Word getting into you." It doesn't really make much difference in our life if we're into the Word, but we don't allow it to get into us.
[time=2123] James gives great commentary on that principle in James chapter 1.
[time=2128] Let me read a few verses for you, beginning with 22.
[time=2132] "Do not merely listen to the Word, and so deceive yourselves.
[time=2138] Do what it says.
[time=2141] Anyone who listens to the Word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in the mirror, and after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forget what he looks
[time=2154] like." The point James is saying is you get up in the morning, you look in the mirror and very few of us can afford to look in the mirror without calling ourselves to make some repairs.
[time=2167] What's the point in looking in the mirror if you don't correct what you see?
[time=2173] James says, "What's the point of being in the Word if you don't let the Word get into you and correct what you see?" But these people were off to a superb start because they had received God's Word not
[time=2186] only intellectually and confirmed that it's the Word of God but they received it practically
[time=2193] and said, "This is how I live." Warren Wiersby on speaking on this passage talks about the great value of God's Word.
[time=2203] He said, "First of all, God's Word is more valuable than food."
[time=2209] Job put it this way in Job 23.12.
[time=2214] "I have not departed from the commands of the Lord's lips.
[time=2218] I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily food."
[time=2227] I don't know about you, but I haven't found a smorgasbord yet that I can resist.
[time=2232] Eating is my favorite sport in season and out of season, indoors and out of doors.
[time=2238] I haven't found a diet yet that I can't break.
[time=2241] And as much as I love food, God says His Word's better than food.
[time=2249] In Psalm 119, David said that His Word is better than money, than gold, than the spoil
[time=2257] that a conqueror takes from a land that He's plundered.
[time=2260] Psalm 119 verse 72, "The law from your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces
[time=2267] of silver and gold, more precious than food, more precious than money."
[time=2274] And then Psalm 119, 148 says God's Word is more precious than sleep.
[time=2281] My eyes stayed open through the watches of the night that I may meditate on your promises.
[time=2288] Military term of a watch.
[time=2290] One man had watched from sundown to what we would call ten.
[time=2296] The second watch was from ten till two.
[time=2298] The third watch was from two till dawn.
[time=2302] Here's a soldier who says, "I've got a watch through the night." And then when my watch is over and it's my turn to sleep, I instead turn to your Word.
[time=2312] It's more precious to me than sleep.
[time=2315] The value of God's Word, of getting into it and letting it get into you.
[time=2321] When Vince Lombardi took over the Green Bay Packers, they had taken over the sole proprietorship of the basement of the NFL.
[time=2329] They were the losing of the losers.
[time=2333] After their first practice, he was so discouraged, he interrupted that first practice, called them into the locker room and told them how poor their blocking was, how atrocious their tackling was, and they were overall disorganized.
[time=2347] And he said, "Gentlemen, I'm going to take you back to the very basics of football."
[time=2354] And he reached down and he pulled up an oblong object.
[time=2358] And he looked out into an audience that had Paul Horning and Elijah Pitts and Jimmy Taylor and Bart Starr, and he said, "Gentlemen, this is a football."
[time=2370] Ladies and gentlemen, this is God's Word.
[time=2376] Most of us need to go back to the very basics of being in God's Word,
[time=2383] and then applying it and letting God's Word get into us.
[time=2389] This church was off to a superb start because they had accepted God's Word.
[time=2395] They're off to a superb start, secondly because they accepted affliction and problems in their life.
[time=2403] Verse 14, it says, "You brothers became imitators of the churches in Judea.
[time=2409] What were the churches of Judea like?" Well, they had suffered from the hands of people who had killed the prophets.
[time=2415] They had killed Jesus and they were now driving Paul out.
[time=2420] Here was a brand new church.
[time=2422] Three weeks old in the Lord, and they already had begun to imitate a mature church
[time=2428] by accepting adversity.
[time=2431] One of the real tests of our faith is adversity.
[time=2435] Jesus taught the story about the sower who scattered seed, and it fell in various types of soil.
[time=2443] One of the soils was a soil that sprang up with roots, of weeds, choking it out, and it died
[time=2455] because it was choked out by the cares of this world.
[time=2458] A second fell on some hard soil, and it didn't have any root, and the sun came out and scorched it, and it died.
[time=2466] Jesus said that illustrates that some of us have shallow faith, and when the heat of adversity comes, we will wither in faith.
[time=2475] The Four Spiritual Laws is an excellent way of sharing the gospel.
[time=2480] Law one says, "God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life." But I think it ought to have Law one be, which says, "And God's wonderful plan usually includes problems in affliction and trials and adversity." Perhaps we have erroneously presented the gospel to make people think that if you just come to Jesus, he's going to make everything better.
[time=2505] He's going to make everything happy. He's going to make everything wonderful.
[time=2509] And the truth of the matter is Jesus Christ said, "I have not come to bring peace but a sword, and a man's enemies will be in his own household." I'm thankful for this great country in that we don't have persecution in this church today. Yet some of you would much rather the United States government was against them because you have your father against you, or your husband against you.
[time=2537] You've come to Christ, and now you've been rejected by family members or close friends.
[time=2545] This group, this church, was off to a superb start because they accepted adversity as normal in the Christian life.
[time=2557] Well with this great start, they then had a severe setback in verse 17.
[time=2565] But brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time in person, not in thought, out of our intense longing, we made every effort to see you for we wanted to come to you. Certainly I, Paul, did again and again, but Satan stopped us.
[time=2585] For what is our hope? Our joy?
[time=2589] Or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you, indeed?
[time=2597] You are our glory and joy.
[time=2601] Well, they were off to a superb start, but now they were experiencing a severe setback.
[time=2613] First of all, they were set back because Paul was torn away from them. Just a few weeks of ministry and persecution became so intense that Paul had the free for his life. The words tear away actually are Greek words that means to make orphan.
[time=2633] Paul looked at them as his children.
[time=2637] In chapter 2 verse 17, he says, "I took care of you like a mother.
[time=2641] I watched over you in verse 11 like a father.
[time=2645] They were his children and he loved them.
[time=2649] And he pictured them as an abandoned, deserted child." That was a severe setback.
[time=2657] Paul was dynamic. He was influential, but he was also gone. And how much could have been accomplished in two to three weeks? And now he's gone.
[time=2669] And in his place reigns adversity.
[time=2673] It was a severe setback. And the setback continued because he was not only gone, but he wasn't coming back.
[time=2681] At least at this time. He said, "I've been separated from you, but not in mind or heart, not in our thoughts just physically." He said, "But I have wanted to come to you again and again, but Satan has stopped us." Paul said, "I'm not only gone. I'm not able to get back to you." The word stop is a military word for a roadblock.
[time=2705] When the Romans would march on their ways, their Ignatian way, or their Alexandrian way, these roads that were built so that their army could march with speed to the battle front.
[time=2717] The enemies would come along and they would dig up the road and as they dug up the road they would pile debris in the road so the army had to stop.
[time=2727] Paul said, "We wanted to find a road, an opportunity to come to you, but our enemy, Satan, has dug up the road and he's piled the debris and we couldn't come. We couldn't come." The question is, with them being orphaned, and Paul unable to return would they survive this setback.
[time=2751] In 1836 the island country of Madagascar was closed to missions. Missionaries were driven out of the country and expelled. Bibles were burned, Christians were persecuted and even put to death and for 25 years the island country of Madagascar was closed to Christianity.
[time=2771] Missionaries had left behind 1,000 Christians but they had been persecuted and they had been tormented.
[time=2779] Their Bibles were taken away and when they survived 25 years later the country of Madagascar was opened.
[time=2787] Missionaries returned and they began the search to see where there were so many Christians left. Of the 1,000 were there any who would follow Christ in the face of such adversity.
[time=2799] They didn't find 1,000 Christians. They found 7,000 Christians.
[time=2803] In the face of adversity they had not only survived but that church had thrived. Paul writes to a group of people who were facing severe setback.
[time=2815] He wants to know if they're surviving. Perhaps they would even thrive. You today, beloved, may be going through a severe setback in your life. You may have lost a job to no fault of your own. Your boss may make an issue of your Christianity. Your spouse may be guilty of infidelity, repeatedly.
[time=2839] You've been faithful. You're going through a severe setback.
[time=2843] You've done your best to raise your children as Paul would say in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord and now in late adolescence they've broken your heart. You finally got the empty nest and now all the birds are coming home.
[time=2863] It's a severe setback.
[time=2867] Will you survive? Will you thrive?
[time=2871] Now how can you make your stride steady? That's what chapter 3 is all about.
[time=2879] A steady stride. In chapter 3 there are 13 verses. First of all let me just give you somewhat of what I'll call a sequential narrative and then three principles of how to maintain your stride in this Christian life. The narrative follows like this in verses 1 through 5. Paul said I can't come to see you so I sent Timothy to try to encourage you and to find out how you were doing.
[time=2907] In verses 6 through 10 Timothy returns from Thessal and Ikey to Paul with a great word of encouragement.
[time=2915] He tells them they're not only hanging in there but they're pressing on and then in verses 11 through 13 Paul prays for them.
[time=2927] But allow me to pull out of chapter 3 three principles to help us thrive in our Christian life or if you're a runner a way to maintain your stride.
[time=2939] Principle number one is this one. Remember that suffering is inevitable in life.
[time=2947] Look at chapter 3 verses 3 and 4 He said I'm sending Timothy to strengthen you and encourage you so that no one will be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them. In fact when we were with you we kept telling you that we would be persecuted.
[time=2971] Trials in our Christian life are inevitable and the Bible tells us to do three things with our trials. Expect them accept them and endure them.
[time=2987] In James chapter 1 verses 2 and 3 it says Count it all the joy my brothers when you fall into various trials knowing that the testing of your faith works patience and let patience have its complete work so that you might be complete entire lacking nothing.
[time=3007] Jesus said think it not strange that you shall have tribulation. For in this life you shall have tribulation but fear not.
[time=3019] I have overcome the world. In our life as believers we should expect tribulation.
[time=3027] We should not only expect that but we should accept it the Bible says with a spirit of joy like the athlete who only grows stronger through tearing down the muscle tissue or the musician who only plays better by perfecting the skills with exhausted hands. God says I will exhaust you and I will work on you through trials so that you can grow taller through testing.
[time=3055] A man had walked through life carrying the cross of suffering. He met an angel one day and complained to the angel that his cross was too hard.
[time=3067] Angel said well we've got a warehouse up in heaven you can trade that one in on another one if you like.
[time=3071] Could I the man said sure said the angel come on I'll take you. The angel took him to heaven they went into this warehouse and it was just row after row after row of crosses all sizes shapes and matter of construction the man dropped his at the door and the angel reshelved it and he began walking down and I only picked up a cross and he thought oh I can carry this one much better and he put that cross on his shoulder and he said no it's a little heavier than I thought he put it back and he took up another cross put it on his shoulder and he said this is too light I'd be embarrassed picked up another one and it was way too long I mean he was just dragging it picked up another one that was too bulky rejected cross after cross and then finally he came to a cross and he picked it up put it on he said that's not bad it's heavy it'll be hard to carry but it's not so hard that I don't believe I could carry it I'm all right I'll take this one he said to the angel and you'll said of course you will that's the one you brought in the door with you you know God says you're going to carry a cross through life you're going to suffer it's inevitable but accept it because I know exactly what you need I know exactly how much you can take I know exactly what shape size and weight your cross ought to be simply accept it and he says endure it look at verses 7 and 8 therefore brothers in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged because of your faith for now we really live since you are standing firm in the Lord endure it the pain endure the temporary defeats because they'll come a day when Jesus will announce you the victor all of England waited for news from the European front who had won Wellington or Napoleon finally a ship worked its way up the Tames river on a foggy morning the signal man came out on the bow of the ship and with his flags using semaphore he began the signal and the message came out Wellington defeated and then the fog covered up the ship word spread from mouth to mouth to the whole city it heard the message Wellington defeated the fog lifted they could see the ship again and the signal man came out again and he flashed Wellington defeated the enemy oh you may be at the very moment when it looks like you're defeated but God hasn't finished the message yet and he says he won't put more on you than he puts in you the ability to endure and it's too soon to quit maintaining your stride is first of all realizing that suffering is inevitable in our life secondly he gives this principle life is measured in spiritual growth not material gain. Verse 7 says therefore brothers in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith now we really live Paul is running for his life they're being persecuted he's being persecuted and he says this is really living this is great because life is measured in our spiritual growth not our material gain. You perhaps have seen the bumper sticker it says the one who dies with the most toys wins it personifies our obsession with material gain this man who played by those rules said to his friends now when I go I want you to send me out with style you know those new Gucci shoes I bought make sure they bury me in those in that hand tailored suit that's what I want to be laid out in make sure my Rolex watch is on my left arm my left arm's folded right on top of my right arm so everybody can see it and I want every piece of jewelry put on my hands and wrists and so when he died they put him out there in his fancy suit his Gucci shoes his Rolex watch and all the diamonds and jewelry hat and just before they closed the lid on his casket one of his friends looked into man that's really living and you know that's the values of the world in which
[time=3349] we live you're really living if you've got everything this world can offer materially and some of you've got it all and you're saying it's no better than when I had nothing because life does not consist Jesus said in the abundance of the things that a man possesses then in what does life consist it consists in knowing Jesus Christ and living for him recent advertisement for a stocks and bonds company shows a man walking disgusted to the mailbox obviously in his hand is his tax returned he owes he's not getting back he tells about how much money he's made in the stock market and how much he has to pay in taxes and he throws it in the box with this note it's not what you earn that counts it's what you keep you know as you live through this life it's not going to matter what you are I earn it's going to matter what we keep and there's only two things you can keep for eternity one is your own soul and two are the souls of others that you lead to Jesus Christ and when it's all over that's what it is it's over and life is measured not in material gain but in spiritual growth that's really living the third principle he gives to maintaining our stride is remember that the race is continuous versus eleven through thirteen he prays for them Chuck Swindall gives these three application of his prayers one he prays that they mentally grow wiser he's praying that their faith might abound more and more two he prays that they'll emotionally grow stronger he prays that their love will abound more and more in this world it's no friend to faith and the only friends we've got are each other we need to learn to love each other and thirdly he prays that they'll spiritually grow purer and if you'll remember that the race is continuous
[time=3471] we're to keep growing mentally wiser emotionally stronger spiritually purer in the 1985 US Open Dennis Watkins needed to make a 40 foot putt the win
[time=3485] but if he could get down in two he would tie stroke the ball right at the hole and it broke right at the hole and stopped at the lip of the cup in disgust he stood over the ball waiting for it to fall waiting waiting and it didn't fall and he tapped it in for a tie no he got a two stroke penalty for delay of game he lost the match and sixty seven thousand dollars we've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and orchestra
