[time=113] The greatest issue confronting Christianity today is not a tack from the outside, but it's an attitude on the inside.
[time=122] It is an overwhelming preoccupation with personal happiness, and God is not concerned about our happiness.
[time=131] For He has called us not the happiness, but the holiness.
[time=136] [MUSIC]
[time=149] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hong. Thank you for joining us.
[time=155] Rick's message today is entitled "Pleasing God." The phrase "God is not primarily concerned about our happiness." Or "He has not called us to happiness, but to holiness." May it first appear harsh.
[time=168] But after deeper thought, it is clear that we are called to serve God.
[time=172] He is not called to serve us.
[time=174] The Lord's Prayer does not say, "My kingdom come, my will be done." We invite you to study along with us today, here on the Bible Hour, as Rick outlines three principles for "Pleasing God."
[time=188] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=191] Rick's text is taken from the book of 1 Thessalonians 4 verses 1 through 12.
[time=198] Today's special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir.
[time=203] And Lisa Redeker.
[time=208] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=216] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=222] Now here's Rick.
[time=226] It is a joy to welcome you to this worship service this morning.
[time=231] We trust that God has prepared your heart already.
[time=234] Not only to come to get something out of a service, but primarily to come to give.
[time=239] To give to God our love, our praise, our adoration, and our worship.
[time=244] We're thankful that you've come here to praise God together today.
[time=248] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=253] It's our privilege of hearing our choir sing a hymn that's a favorite of mine.
[time=258] I believe it was written by Charles Wesley.
[time=261] Its title is "And Can It Be?" that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood.
[time=267] It's a song that speaks of God's great grace and His love for us, and the power that the gospel has to unshackle and unburden our lives today.
[time=277] And can it be?
[time=282] [MUSIC - 265 seconds]
[time=569] It is indeed amazing if you put yourself in that place and say what I be willing to die for my friends and loved ones the way Jesus died for us.
[time=576] One of the most familiar hymns concerning the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=586] Number two hundred two will sing the first second and fourth stanzas together of two hundred two.
[time=600] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=701] On a comforting thought to know that God's grace is greater than all of our sins and all of the failures that we might commit.
[time=708] He indeed is a God that exercises grace to all of us.
[time=713] We've been actively singing now let us draw our attention to the special music of Lisa Renekor she sings for us.
[time=721] [MUSIC]
[time=746] There is promise stands worthy of the throne wondrous glory spans galaxies unknown and why did wonders waste he cares for his own and I reserve my trust and praise for him alone.
[time=761] How in all that he is the O.I.G. by his power we have been delivered.
[time=769] Nations rise and fall, he outlast them all. He's free, he's good, he's God.
[time=778] [MUSIC]
[time=800] When we hide there is a throne and a crown we decide in whose court there will be found those are lined with those who are in us to bow, but there is only one king among the crowd.
[time=816] Hallelujah he reads in majesty to his honor we shall be se cheers.
[time=826] We say that he brings us to our need. There is faith in hope, there is love.
[time=833] On him came forever and ever Jesus Christ is out of anymore.
[time=841] Make him master God of all creation.
[time=845] On him came forever and ever.
[time=851] [MUSIC]
[time=857] See his glory in his hands.
[time=864] See his glory on the earth.
[time=872] See his glory in the lights of the Lord.
[time=880] Who would dare have to compare with our great God in coming forever and ever.
[time=888] Jesus Christ eternal living Lord.
[time=894] On him came forever and ever Jesus Christ eternal living Lord.
[time=902] Make him master God of all creation.
[time=906] On him came forever and ever.
[time=914] Jesus Christ eternal living Lord.
[time=919] Make him master God of all creation.
[time=923] On him came forever and ever.
[time=939] [MUSIC]
[time=947] [APPLAUSE]
[time=953] Once again it's our privilege to break away from the morning worship service for just a few moments
[time=959] to talk directly with you friends who join us by way of television here for the Bible hour.
[time=965] Pete welcome back and I hope you had a great vacation.
[time=968] Thank you Rick we had a very restful time.
[time=970] It was a good time of relaxation no telephones around we're back out in the wilderness of Arkansas and we really did have a good time but we're glad to be back today.
[time=978] Well welcome home it sounds like you were in a nice place and had a nice time.
[time=982] It's always good to go somewhere in another part of the area where you've never been and just see how people live and how things are going in that particular area of the country.
[time=992] Well welcome home and welcome to the Bible hour today. During this month we're sharing an exciting book with you titled
[time=1000] Approaching Hoofbeats the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse book written by none other than Dr. Billy Graham.
[time=1008] Dr. Graham needs no introduction or explanation to anyone.
[time=1012] He is one of the premier spokesman for God in this generation.
[time=1017] There's hardly a person who's not heard his voice proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1023] Along with being a fine preacher and evangelist Dr. Graham is an excellent author and in this book he gives us some good insights into the first chapters of the book of Revelation.
[time=1035] You may remember if you've studied the book of Revelation it talks about Four Horsemen in there and Dr. Graham talks about what does the pale horse mean? What does the white horse mean? What does the red horse mean? What does the black horse mean?
[time=1048] And how does that relate to the world in which you and I live and are a part of?
[time=1053] Well we'd like to give you a copy of this book as a gift from us to you to help you to prepare to live in these days.
[time=1060] If you'll write to us we'll send you a copy free. We'll even pay the postage. We want you to have it. So please do write for this book.
[time=1068] The events of the last days are very exciting and we want you to have this book. You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour.
[time=1075] We're offering this book during this month because starting next week we're working our way through the book of First Thessalonians and we'll come to some passages in First Thessalonians that are parallel to Dr. Graham's teaching.
[time=1100] Out of the book of Revelation. In First Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 13 through 18 the Bible tells us about a coming mysterious event that we call the Rapture.
[time=1116] It's a time when Jesus Christ comes again not to the earth but to the air and He takes every believer in Jesus Christ home to heaven with Him.
[time=1127] Those that are dead, their bodies are resurrected and those who are alive are to use the word Rapture are snatched up.
[time=1135] And then in First Thessalonians chapter 5 it talks about the thief in the night, the coming days of tribulation.
[time=1143] And as a supplement to our study here on the Bible Hour we've offered you this book so we do hope you'll write and we will once again give you that address.
[time=1152] You can receive this book by writing to the Bible Hour. 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1162] Peter, your sons are between the ages of operation outreach. Peter went years ago, he's now at Liberty and Andy will look forward to it in the days ahead.
[time=1171] Well I remember when Peter went it was a very very good experience for them to witness on the beaches there and to kind of solidify their own testimony and what they believe about Jesus Christ not only from mom and dad but personally.
[time=1185] And I was glad when Andy said the other day I'm really looking forward to the day when I can go on operation outreach.
[time=1190] That's an exciting time for our children. Oh that's great.
[time=1193] Well our young people about 25 of them are home from Florida they had an outstanding time ministering in Florida and a church and also on the beaches and one of our cameramen.
[time=1203] The young man operating the camera that I'm talking into right now went on that trip and shared with him this morning that the highlight of his week was learning to be bold and speaking out for Jesus Christ.
[time=1214] I hope that you're bold in sharing your faith in Christ. We want to thank you for your letters of encouragement as many of you have written and I understand during this past week we heard from native state to you California.
[time=1226] Well we've been out in California for a while and our director of television at Richard mentioned to me that there were several letters that came in from California so someone out there was watching we're encouraged by that.
[time=1237] Well thank each of you for writing and we do encourage you to write that lets us know how we can sharpen our ministry to better minister to your needs.
[time=1246] It's always encouraging and we thank you and encourage you to write and let us know how God is using this ministry in your life.
[time=1253] Before we go back to our morning worship service Pete would you share the address one final time.
[time=1257] Yes like Rick said we encourage you to write to us today and let us know that you're watching and write to us at the Bible Hour 7400E state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1272] Thank you Pete and thank you for joining us here for the Bible Hour.
[time=1302] Thank you for joining us to send you away and just like you promised you came there to stay.
[time=1321] And Jesus said come to the water stand by my side.
[time=1339] I know you are thirsty you won't be denied.
[time=1350] I felt every tear when in darkness you cried and I strode to remind you that for those tears I died.
[time=1379] Jesus I give you my heart and my soul I know now without God.
[time=1395] I'd never be home save you open all the right doors and I thank you and I praise you on earth's humble shore.
[time=1421] Take me I'm yours.
[time=1430] And Jesus said come to the water stand by my side.
[time=1441] I know you are thirsty you won't be denied.
[time=1452] I felt every tear when in darkness you cried and I strode to remind you that for those tears I died.
[time=1481] And I strode to remind you that for those tears I die.
[time=1511] I invite you to pray with me now.
[time=1517] Father as we hear a song that speaks of your compassion and your love.
[time=1522] Thank you for the reminder that Jesus died for the brokenness and the hurt and the sorrow of my life.
[time=1530] We pray that that song would be a comfort to each ear that would hear it this morning.
[time=1535] We pray particularly for Brian and his family as Kim even these moments is going to be by the side of her father who was terminally ill with cancer.
[time=1544] We ask you to comfort Kim, her family and Brian in these days.
[time=1549] May they know that you walk with them even through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=1554] We would pray today that you would comfort Omar Baker and the loss of his partner 56 years Alma.
[time=1561] We would ask you to be in a hospital room in the heart and the mind of 91 year old Bessie Blakely who fights to recover from a stroke.
[time=1570] May they know today that you love them, that you care for them.
[time=1575] We pray that you would encourage the hearts of those who are wrestling with the issues of life that are out of control.
[time=1583] Particularly those who have children who they have loved and they have labored by their side but are now breaking their heart.
[time=1592] Give parents strength and wisdom.
[time=1595] Pray that you give people who are wrestling with their parents wisdom to know how to care for the aged and the elderly and the ill.
[time=1604] Teach us to be compassion and patient as they were with us as small children.
[time=1610] Give us sensitivity to all generations.
[time=1614] We pray that you would give determination, spiritual fortitude and strength to those who are battling to stay free, to stay clean, to say no to drugs.
[time=1627] Help them to go beyond and to say yes to a life of obedience to you.
[time=1632] We pray that your hand would be upon those today who are fighting for their health.
[time=1639] Particularly for Scott Schindler's mother in the hospital for Steve Mahoney as he recovers from an extended surgery.
[time=1649] Father we would pray today that you would give grace to each one who needs it.
[time=1655] But after this long list of wants and wishes, Father we want to give to you.
[time=1662] We want to give to you our worship, our love.
[time=1665] On this first day of the week we want to give to you a new week.
[time=1669] We want to surrender it to you.
[time=1671] We want you to set the agenda.
[time=1674] You to take the initiative on our schedule.
[time=1677] We want to please you today, tomorrow.
[time=1681] We want our lives to be wholly devoted to you.
[time=1686] Help us today to know and to do your will.
[time=1690] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1695] If you have a Bible I invite you to open it to 1 Thessalonians in the 4th chapter.
[time=1700] We'll be studying together verses 1 through 12 today.
[time=1704] Allow me to read those verses for you now.
[time=1708] Finally, brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God as in fact you
[time=1716] are living.
[time=1718] Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.
[time=1724] You know what instructions we gave you by authority of the Lord Jesus.
[time=1731] It is God's will that you should be holy, that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[time=1742] that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
[time=1750] not in passionate lust, like the heathen, who do not know God.
[time=1757] And that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him.
[time=1763] The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you.
[time=1770] For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.
[time=1776] Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man, but God, who gives you his holy spirit.
[time=1786] Now about brotherly love, we do not need to write to you.
[time=1792] For you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.
[time=1797] And in fact, you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia, yet we urge your brothers to do so more and more.
[time=1809] Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your hands, just as we told you.
[time=1820] So that your daily life may win the respective outsiders, and so that you will not be dependent on anyone.
[time=1831] This morning I would like to begin our message with a harsh word.
[time=1842] It's usually my style to begin with an illustration that I hope grabs your attention, brings your mind to a single point of thought.
[time=1845] But this morning I want to start in a very different way.
[time=1848] I have for you a harsh word, not one that you will receive instantly with sweetness like delightful dessert.
[time=1860] It's pointed, it's harsh, but it's true.
[time=1866] The word I want to share with you is this.
[time=1869] God is not concerned that you be happy.
[time=1876] That didn't even make His agenda today.
[time=1879] Many of us have come through the door, and we're not happy.
[time=1883] And we look at our job, and we look at the people above us, and we say, "Idiots!" That's how they got there.
[time=1889] Just idiots got promoted to the top, so they turned the pyramid upside down.
[time=1893] And I am miserable because of them.
[time=1896] Others of you are at the top, and you're saying, "Mm-mm!" From up here I see it all clearly, it's you down there.
[time=1903] And I would be happy if you down there.
[time=1907] Others of you have walked through the door and said, "I married you because I thought you'd make me happy."
[time=1913] And you don't make me happy anymore.
[time=1915] And I'm not happy, and it's your fault.
[time=1919] Others of you look at your children and say, "I remember when our kids used to make us happy.
[time=1924] I'm not happy anymore." And somebody said, "You're not happy?
[time=1929] What you need to do is go to church.
[time=1931] What you need to do is give your heart to Jesus Christ, and Jesus will make you happy."
[time=1937] I don't believe God's concerned about our happiness today.
[time=1941] I believe God is concerned about our holiness.
[time=1944] He has not called us to be happy.
[time=1949] And we are preoccupied with being happy.
[time=1952] And the greatest threat on Christianity is not the issues out there of secular humanism
[time=1959] that denies God's existence and elevates man to the point of God.
[time=1963] The enemy out there is not Satan himself.
[time=1966] The enemy is not some strange occult or cult that denies the deity of Christ.
[time=1971] The enemy is the attitude in here that says, "I'm called to be happy." And God is obligated to make me happy.
[time=1979] Church exists to fulfill my dreams.
[time=1982] And I've come here today to get a dose of happiness that I sure do need.
[time=1988] God is not concerned that we be happy.
[time=1992] He is concerned that we be holy.
[time=1995] But here's the catch.
[time=1997] If we are committed to being holy, I believe we'll find happiness.
[time=2003] And if we're committed to being happy, we'll neglect every principle of holiness and end up miserable.
[time=2009] Joe Rich, a science teacher, gave me this illustration that helped me to understand it.
[time=2014] If you were to take copper in the raw ore state and you were to melt it down and to burn off impurities
[time=2022] and impurities, too, you got it 99% pure.
[time=2026] And right in front of you, you had refined copper down to 99% pure.
[time=2032] And then you took that copper and refined it to 100% pure.
[time=2037] The two impurities that you would bring out would be gold and silver.
[time=2044] And the gold and silver that you would extract would be valuable enough that it would pay for all the process of refining the original copper.
[time=2054] And if you will be holy and allow God to refine your life,
[time=2060] that which will come out of it will be a happiness that will be more than adequate compensation for every sacrifice you've ever made to him to be holy.
[time=2072] In the passage that we just read a moment ago, it gives us, first of all, a general plea and then a specific plan.
[time=2080] The general plea is simply this, a call to live to please God.
[time=2087] It begins with this word, finally.
[time=2090] Now, in the realm of preaching, teaching, and scripture, the word finally doesn't mean the thing.
[time=2096] Paul says finally and he's not even close to finally done with this book.
[time=2100] He's going to have several more, finallys.
[time=2103] A preacher took his arm, went like this, took off his watch, laid it down on the pulpit next to him and took a good stare.
[time=2110] Little boy looked at his dad and said, "Dad, what's all that mean?" Dad looked at the son, he said, "Son, unfortunately, in this church it doesn't mean a thing."
[time=2121] As you read the word finally, it's not saying this is his final thought, this is the conclusion.
[time=2127] It's really a transitory word that's taking us from one section of First Thessalonians, what was largely retracing.
[time=2134] Paul's concern for the Thessalonians is sending Timothy to be with them.
[time=2138] And it's now like he says, "New chapter, new theme, I want to give you some very pointed and specific instructions."
[time=2145] Finally, it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm done either, so if I slip and say that somewhere in the middle of the message, don't get your hopes up.
[time=2153] Finally's brother, finally brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God.
[time=2160] Please notice, first of all, that this instruction is past tense. He has already told him all this information before.
[time=2167] It's not new information, he had told it to them when he was with them in person, he probably told it to Timothy to tell them when Timothy came to be with them.
[time=2177] He's saying, "We've already instructed you, but I want to remind you again." You know, most of us don't need to learn anything new out of the Bible, we just need to relearn what we already should know.
[time=2188] Mark Twain once said, "It's not the parts of the Bible that I don't know that bother me, it's the parts that I do."
[time=2195] Most of us know enough of the Bible, we could go home and spend the rest of our life obeying the parts that we do know, and that would be challenged enough.
[time=2204] Paul's reminding them of things that he had already instructed them, and his general plea is this, "Live your life to please God."
[time=2216] And that simple instruction runs contrary to every other instinct in an instruction we receive in life.
[time=2224] When God created Adam, he created Adam about five foot eight and a half inches tall with brown curly hair, and a sinless nature.
[time=2235] And Adam made a choice to sin, and when Adam made that choice, he altered his nature.
[time=2245] Previous to that choice, he was free not to sin. His desire was not to please himself, but to please God.
[time=2253] And once he sinned, there was a change within him, and that change brought about a whole new personality that was now free to sin, and desired to sin, and didn't want to please God anymore, wanted to please himself.
[time=2270] And every child of the human race that has ever been born has been born of that nature of sin that Adam acquired, which means our human nature, our human propensity, is to live for ourself and to sin.
[time=2288] That's the way I am. That's the way you are. I had an early job as a high school senior as a construction worker. I loved it. It was hard work.
[time=2302] We had to carry the shingles up onto the high roofs. We had to dig the ditches. We had to hollow cement in the wheelbarrow. It was tough going.
[time=2310] But the job got real tough one day. When the boss picked me up in his car and said, "I need you to do a different job for me for an hour." I didn't worry about it.
[time=2320] So we got to his home. He said, "I have two kids, ages two and three, and my wife and I both have to be gone. You're going to watch him for the next hour."
[time=2330] Send me to the highest roof with 80 pounds of shingles. I'll gladly do it. Just don't send me the two-year-olds. These two little kids came out. I mean, they were angelic looking.
[time=2342] These kids were wearing designer clothes before the designers designed them. I mean, they had it all. And they were sweet and beautiful looking.
[time=2350] And we went out into the backyard to their swing set, which cost more than the house in which I grew up in. And both of these two little children, ages two and three, grabbed the same swing.
[time=2361] And at the same moment, uttered the same word, "mine!" And the war began. It was the longest hour of my life. But it was my first lesson in human behavior.
[time=2374] We are born with a spirit in us that says, "mine." And we lay claim on everything chiefly. This is my life. It is mine. And don't you touch it.
[time=2388] I don't want you to touch it if you're my principal. I don't want you to touch it if you're my boss. I don't want you to touch it if you're my spouse.
[time=2395] I don't want you to touch it if you're my parent. I don't want you to touch it if you're my child. This is my life.
[time=2402] And I don't want you to touch it either. God, that's our instincts.
[time=2407] And the secular society comes along and says, "It's your life, baby. Do what you want to do."
[time=2414] And God gives this very general plea. Don't live any longer to please yourself. Live your life in order to please him.
[time=2427] And in verse three, he gives what we would call grammatically, words put in opposition to explain it again.
[time=2436] One is he says, "This is God's will." He explains God's will. It is God's will that you be holy.
[time=2446] And then he takes it a step further. It is God's will that you be holy that you be sexually pure.
[time=2454] And the general plea of all of this is that you surrender your will and your life to God.
[time=2461] The Lord's prayer does not read, "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, my kingdom come, my will be done, up there in heaven, just like it is down here on earth."
[time=2474] Instead, we are called to pray for God's will and were to submit ourselves to pleasing him.
[time=2484] Now that sounds harsh, but please notice that the authority of this is based not in Paul. In verse two he says,
[time=2493] "You know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus."
[time=2499] This was in Paul's idea of how we want to order a new religious system.
[time=2504] These were the instructions that God gave a general plea was to live for Christ, to do God's will and to seek to be holy.
[time=2517] Usually somewhere between ages 18 and 25 we become preoccupied with the will of God.
[time=2524] Is it God's will that I go to Taylor or is it God's will that I go to Grace?
[time=2534] Is it God's will that I marry Fred or is it God's will that I marry Sam?
[time=2541] I wish Bob was willing that it be God's will.
[time=2544] We get preoccupied with God's will.
[time=2547] Is it God's will that I stay here in America or God's will that I go to Africa?
[time=2552] Can I tell you God's will is very rarely a person, it is very rarely a place, it is almost always character.
[time=2562] God's will is that you be holy whether you're married to Fred or to Bob or whether you never marry.
[time=2569] It's God's will that you be holy whether you're in Fort Wayne, Akron, Ohio or Timbuktu is will is that you be holy.
[time=2577] If you want to know God's will and there's a menu of choices in front of you choose the one that allows you to be holy.
[time=2585] If all of them choose you could choose would allow you to be holy choose the one you like.
[time=2591] If one of them encroaches upon your holiness don't do it.
[time=2595] It's not God's will no matter how much they'll pay you, no matter how significant the promotion, no matter how many doors it will open, no matter how much prestige,
[time=2606] no matter how many people will applaud if it infringes upon your ability to be holy don't do it.
[time=2613] It's out of God's will because his will is simply that we be holy.
[time=2621] Now in verses three through twelve he's going to give us three specific principles of how to please God.
[time=2630] Principle number one we've already alluded to this is God's will that you be holy that you avoid sexual immorality.
[time=2640] Principle number one is this one control your lust.
[time=2648] The word for sexual immorality here is the generic term.
[time=2654] There's a very specific term that would refer to sex outside of marriage between married people, Bob and Carol Ted Nalas, adultery.
[time=2666] There are other words that would be used to describe sexual immorality amongst unmarried people.
[time=2674] But the word sexual pornia here is an all inclusive term that says avoid all sexual immorality.
[time=2683] If you're married don't be unfaithful to your spouse.
[time=2686] If you're not married don't be sexually involved with anyone until you are married and then only be involved with them.
[time=2694] It is God's will that you maintain sexual purity and control your lust.
[time=2701] After that statement he gives three points of elaboration.
[time=2705] Point number one is learn to control your sexual appetite.
[time=2711] Verse five.
[time=2713] Verse four excuse me that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable.
[time=2722] You see you must learn sexual self-control early in life.
[time=2728] And if you haven't learned it early in life you need to learn it early today.
[time=2734] Because nothing will be a substitute for sexual self-control.
[time=2740] Some say well I've only been sexually active because I wasn't married when I get married then that won't be a problem.
[time=2748] The gong show was here they'd bring the buzzer and give you the hook wrong.
[time=2754] A lady came to a council and said I'm so frustrated I don't think my husband is being sexually faithful to me.
[time=2761] The council are uncovered a whole lot of information by asking questions, questions like were you and your husband sexually pure
[time=2769] before you were married?
[time=2771] No.
[time=2773] Was your husband sexually pure before you and he had relations?
[time=2778] No.
[time=2780] Was your husband married when you two began having sexual relations?
[time=2784] Well yes.
[time=2786] The council said now let me make sure I got this straight.
[time=2789] Your husband was sexually involved before he was married.
[time=2793] Then he got married then while he was married he was sexually involved with you.
[time=2797] Now you're married and you're worried that he's sexually involved with somebody else?
[time=2801] Yes.
[time=2802] The council said I can't condemn the man I've got to commend him.
[time=2805] He's consistent.
[time=2807] He is being exactly what he has been all of his life.
[time=2813] He's never learned sexual self-control.
[time=2816] Why do you think he would have it now just because he married you?
[time=2822] The councilor was exactly right.
[time=2826] Marriage does not change a thing.
[time=2829] If you struggle today with pornography you're going to struggle with it whether you get married or not.
[time=2835] If you struggle today with lustful thoughts you're going to struggle with it after you're married.
[time=2841] If you struggle with soap operas today that you're falling in love with another hunk every other week on as your stomach turns you will struggle with that after you're married.
[time=2854] If you struggle with sexual impurity you will struggle with it after you're married.
[time=2859] You've got to learn to control your sexual appetite.
[time=2864] The second elaboration of that principle is this one.
[time=2869] You must maintain a godly testimony.
[time=2872] He says don't live your life in a lustful passion like the Gentiles, the heathen dude.
[time=2879] A little historical insight from William Barkley.
[time=2882] Barkley writes of the Roman and Greek world with these words.
[time=2886] In Rome for the first 520 years of the republic there had not been one single divorce.
[time=2892] But now under the empire as it has been put divorce was a matter of caprice.
[time=2899] Seneca said women were married to be divorced and divorced to be married.
[time=2905] In Rome the years were identified by the names of the consuls.
[time=2911] But it was said that fashionable ladies identified the years by the name of their husbands.
[time=2917] What year was it we had that big flood?
[time=2920] That was the year of Fred.
[time=2922] No that was the year of wrath.
[time=2925] You called it 1982.
[time=2929] People were married and divorced capriciously.
[time=2933] It goes on.
[time=2935] One poet said in quoting an instance that one woman had been married to eight husbands in five years.
[time=2945] Morality was dead.
[time=2947] In Greece immorality had always been quite blatant.
[time=2951] Long ago demands that these had written quote we keep prostitutes for pleasure.
[time=2956] We keep mistresses for the day-to-day needs of the body.
[time=2959] We keep wives for the beginning of children and for the faithful guardianship of our homes.
[time=2965] So long as a man supported his wife and family there was no shame in any extramarital relationships.
[time=2972] That's how the world lived then.
[time=2977] Not all that different than how the world lives now.
[time=2982] And Paul's whole point was just because they lived that way out there doesn't mean we should live that way in here.
[time=2988] In fact we must live the opposite.
[time=2992] The tragedy of our day is that the secular divorce rate is about 50 percent.
[time=3000] And the divorce rate in here is about 49 percent.
[time=3005] The rate of immorality and sexual involvement among high school and college students out there is about 80 to 90 percent.
[time=3014] And in here it's about 80 to 90 percent.
[time=3019] And God says if you want to please me, if you love me, if you want to know my will and your high school student stay sexually pure.
[time=3028] If you want to please me and your college student stay sexually pure.
[time=3033] If you're a married adult stay sexually faithful to your spouse.
[time=3038] If you're a single adult stay sexually pure.
[time=3042] If you're divorced stay sexually pure.
[time=3048] The third elaboration he gives is it's a matter of defrauding one another.
[time=3057] You see whenever you involve yourselves with somebody outside of your mate sexually you rob four people.
[time=3067] First you rob yourself of your own character.
[time=3071] Secondly you rob that person of their character.
[time=3074] Thirdly you rob that person's spouse or future spouse of the faithfulness of their spouse and you rob your spouse of their faithfulness.
[time=3084] And that's why it says in this matter see to it that no one in this matter goes beyond defraud is a good word that King James used but wrongs a brother in this matter.
[time=3098] You see if you came up to me today and when I wasn't looking you stole my expensive $7.99 watch.
[time=3106] I would smile because the battery is just about to go dead but then you later regretted that you took my watch and came back and apologized.
[time=3115] You could hand me the watch and I've lost nothing.
[time=3120] But if I become sexually involved with you or my wife becomes sexually involved with you you cannot give sexual purity back.
[time=3131] It's gone. It's like a spend arrow in the middle of a battle. It is gone.
[time=3139] If you want to please God please him by maintaining sexual purity.
[time=3147] Let me give some insights, some applications that are biblical they're just not in this passage.
[time=3153] Some midpoint applications. One is this, if you have successfully maintained sexual purity keep going, keep going.
[time=3166] Well done. Two, if you've broken sexual purity ask God's forgiveness and maintain sexual purity now.
[time=3179] The lie that Satan got you on number one was it's all right to do it this once.
[time=3185] And now you've done it once, line number two is you've already done it. You might as well keep doing it.
[time=3192] If you've broken that you can't have purity back. You can't have that faithfulness back but what you can do today is you can ask God's forgiveness and you can start today rebuilding a new character.
[time=3208] You can have a changed life. God will wash you. He will cleanse you. He will forgive you.
[time=3214] And while you will not be able to say I've always been faithful you can say I've been faithful for you can start marking time with today.
[time=3224] And you can rebuild your life. It can be better. It can be marvelous. It can be wonderful because he can take something that's broken.
[time=3234] Something that is a mess. And as Bill Gaitherpin he can make something beautiful. Something good.
[time=3242] All of my confusion he understood. All I had to do was ask him. God will rebuild your life if you'll begin sexual purity now.
[time=3255] One to this concept he then gives a word of condemnation. Verse seven verse six last phrase.
[time=3264] The Lord will punish men for all such sins as we have already told you and warned you.
[time=3273] He says don't think that it's no big deal. Don't say well I loved her. She loved me. We didn't hurt anybody.
[time=3282] Jesus said I died for that sin and it hurt me. And I will judge. Oh judge. That's AIDS right?
[time=3291] God's going to give AIDS or herpes simplex 37 to all those immoral people.
[time=3297] That may be one of the natural consequences of sin but please don't see everything that's new as God's divine punishment.
[time=3306] We may find out that more people who are innocent die of AIDS than those who are guilty.
[time=3314] God's punishment may be guilt. Broken relationship. Self-esteem that is damaged. The consequences may be far more spiritual than they are physical.
[time=3331] And then he gives two quick reminders. Reminder number one the whole principle. God has called us to holiness verse seven.
[time=3343] For God did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life. In case you got lost in all this sexual talk God says I've created you.
[time=3354] I've made you for myself and I want you to live to please me and to please me I want you to be holy and that's where the sexual purity comes in.
[time=3365] The second reminder is this. Don't reject this as ancient teachings of Paul or modern preachings of Rick. This is according to verse eight.
[time=3376] The instruction of God and if you reject this instruction you're not rejecting me you're rejecting God.
[time=3385] The second thing that he gives by way of a way to please God is continue loving each other. In verses nine and ten he says you already are doing a great job of it.
[time=3396] He encourages them. He says you're loving each other. You're loving all the brothers in Macedonia. Well done. Keep on going. Just keep loving each other.
[time=3407] Jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples because you love each other. We had a wonderful testimony of our church at Parkview Hospital a number of years ago.
[time=3423] An individual from our church was seriously owned the intensive care ward. A nurse came in and said there must be 50 people out there. What's going on?
[time=3435] And the lady said well if they're nuns it's somebody who's Catholic and if they're not it's somebody who's from Blackhawk.
[time=3443] I can't tell you as a pastor how thrilled my heart that a world would know that we love each other. And as I look out and I see people who love each other and I want to encourage you to keep loving each other and then as Paul said here keep on going.
[time=3459] Keep loving each other. Keep doing it. Keep going. And that's what we're going to do. The third way to please God in verses eleven and twelve is to quietly labor.
[time=3471] Do you want to please God today? The first way you can please him is to control your lust. The second way is to continue loving and the third way is to quietly labor.
[time=3483] The responsibilities it gives are three of them. One lead a quiet life. Two mind your own business and three work with your hands. A quiet life.
[time=3501] [MUSIC]
[time=3517] We've enjoyed sharing with you the musical ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and soloist Lisa Reniker and Brian Losen.
[time=3525] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks. Rick's message today was entitled Please in God. The best way that you could please him today was recognize that you're a sinner and accept his gift of eternal life.
[time=3538] You can do that by praying this prayer with me. Would you bow and pray? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3550] And today I have a need for Christ to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed. I ask you to come in and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3563] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Your Decision to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3577] To receive a copy of Your Decision, or the book mentioned earlier entitled Approaching Hoofbeats, please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3592] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1390, or use the sermon title, Please in God, and please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3613] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends. Perhaps you've thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry. Why not do it today? I know it would be an encouragement to Pastor Rick and the entire Bible hour step.
