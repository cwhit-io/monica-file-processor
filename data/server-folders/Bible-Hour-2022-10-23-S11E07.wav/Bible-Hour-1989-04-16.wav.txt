[time=110] In the early days of World War II, the Japanese army had overwhelmed the Philippine Islands.
[time=117] The American forces arrived, but were pushed back by the Japanese down one small tiny peninsula called the Batan Peninsula.
[time=127] There they held their ground and they dug in.
[time=130] Doug MacArthur was leading the US forces.
[time=134] A message came from FDR in Washington that MacArthur was to leave the Batan Peninsula and go to Australia at night in March of 1942.
[time=145] A torpedo submarine arrived just off Corrigador.
[time=150] But before leaving that peninsula, Doug MacArthur assured the Filipinos and the American troops with this brief statement.
[time=159] "I shall return." And hope sparked a Filipino nation and United States troops fought on in the hope that General Douglas MacArthur would return.
[time=173] And so we too today as believers in Jesus Christ live with the constant hope that Jesus Christ is coming again, for he has promised us, "I shall return."
[time=186] [MUSIC - 7 seconds]
[time=199] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=204] Thank you for joining us.
[time=206] Rick's message today is entitled "Hope in the midst of sorrow." General MacArthur's words, "I shall return and still hope in the hearts of the Philippine nation." The war would go on, but hope was held high.
[time=219] We too as Christians live with hope because Jesus promised, "I will come again and receive you unto myself." The spiritual battle is not over.
[time=228] The war rages on, but he is coming again.
[time=232] We invite you to study with us today on the Bible Hour, hope in the midst of sorrow.
[time=237] As we find several practical insights from Jesus' promise, "I shall return." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=247] Rick's text is taken from the book of 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 13 through chapter 5, verse 11.
[time=254] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=260] Other special music includes a song from celebration and Denise Mitchell.
[time=268] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=278] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=283] Now, here's Rick.
[time=285] We also want to welcome our friends, who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=289] We trust that God will use this hour to strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ, that we'll have a confidence, a hope in the midst of adversity, a steadfast triumph, even when we are in the face of tribulation.
[time=302] As we open up God's word today, we'll discover that God says that He'll rescue us from that great tribulation, but He also said He'll keep us as we face the smaller tribulations of life today.
[time=314] Thank you for worshiping with us, singing together, and we hope that you'll be encouraged even as we listen to music this morning.
[time=329] Jesus, my Lord,
[time=336] my life, my hope.
[time=343] Hear me, let's say, in your way, like home.
[time=353] Hear me, and from life, I dwell in grace,
[time=363] O'er thou the richest of thy grace?
[time=375] Jesus, to bake thy give us all.
[time=384] How can I love thee as I want?
[time=392] And thou hast all thy precious pain,
[time=400] the glorious beauty of thy name?
[time=412] Jesus, we will be my soul.
[time=425] To thee, my heart and soul belongs.
[time=434] All that I have for all is done.
[time=445] And thou, O bless his sin,
[time=452] with your God,
[time=466] thou art my name.
[time=473] Jesus, my Lord,
[time=480] O make me love thee more
[time=493] and more.
[time=498] May that be our prayer today, that as we worship him and as we learn of the glories and riches of his grace, that we will love him more and more, as we worship the charge that we have to glorify him.
[time=511] We'll sing together him number 448, all four verses of him number 448.
[time=521] (Organ music playing)
[time=528] All that I have for all is done.
[time=537] All my writings will say, and fill it all as done.
[time=546] (Organ music playing)
[time=576] All that I have for all is done.
[time=604] Thank you for your singing today.
[time=606] As we look at the charge that God has given him to serve him, certainly in this community, we mean we need to be united in that cause.
[time=614] Let's listen as we hear now from celebration, as they sing a song that will challenge us to be undivided in our work here at Blackhawk and for the Lord.
[time=626] (Organ music playing)
[time=639] We may worship different ways.
[time=647] We may praise him, and yet spend all of our days
[time=657] living life divided,
[time=664] divided.
[time=666] But when we seek him with open hearts
[time=673] he removes the laws we get
[time=680] that keep us apart.
[time=684] We trust him to unite us.
[time=692] We are hearts.
[time=696] We are divided.
[time=701] There should be one sacred one Lord
[time=707] in our hearts.
[time=711] We are divided.
[time=714] Now, unlike his spirit, forevermore.
[time=723] Undivided.
[time=731] It doesn't matter if we all agree.
[time=738] All he asks is that we serve him faithfully
[time=749] and love as he first loved us.
[time=759] He made us in his amen.
[time=766] Born in his eyes, we are all the same.
[time=774] And who are methods, they may be deep red.
[time=781] Jesus is the bond that will remain.
[time=788] In our hearts.
[time=795] We are divided.
[time=800] There should be one sacred one Lord in our hearts.
[time=810] We are divided.
[time=814] So by his spirit, forevermore.
[time=822] In our hearts.
[time=826] We are divided.
[time=831] There should be one sacred one Lord in our hearts.
[time=841] We are divided.
[time=845] Love by his spirit, forevermore.
[time=853] Undivided.
[time=875] â™ª
[time=882] Again, we want to thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=892] I saw your wife earlier this morning, and I think we finally got a Sunday morning spring day, and it is delightful out there.
[time=904] Well, it seems like winter has stuck around for too long, and I enjoy the change of seasons.
[time=909] It was finally nice yesterday to actually get out in the lawn and clear some of the debris away from winter so I enjoy the experience of doing that and I wish them well, but that is one of my few rewards on a Saturday.
[time=920] I like doing that.
[time=923] I enjoy that too.
[time=925] Well, don't call us to come fertilize your yard.
[time=926] We like doing our own.
[time=929] With spring also, let us know that summer is not far away, and we here at Black Hawk's sponsor, a summer Bible conference on Wednesday nights, and the first event of the summer Bible conference is a film called A Man Called Norman.
[time=943] We've ordered this film a long time in advance.
[time=947] It was hard to get.
[time=949] It's such a well received and often requested film.
[time=953] So as you think about the summer, save the Wednesday nights to be a part of the summer Bible conference here at Black Hawk and begin with us on a film called A Man Called Norman.
[time=965] We're delighted that you're a part of this ministry today and want to share with you an extension of this ministry.
[time=972] Today we'll be studying the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[time=976] Some of you are probably World War II veterans, and you remember General Douglas MacArthur's famous words, "I shall return." Well, Jesus also had made that promise.
[time=989] He told his disciples that he would return, that he's coming again, and that's our blessed hope, our confidence, even in the face of sorrow and in the midst of grief.
[time=1000] We call that event the return of Christ.
[time=1003] It's also an event that precedes the tribulation.
[time=1008] And we are rescued by Jesus coming and rapturing us out before the tribulation.
[time=1015] Billy Graham's written an excellent book that tells of those events called The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse or by the other title, Approaching Hoofbeats.
[time=1026] And we'd like to give you a copy so you can be prepared for the coming of Christ.
[time=1031] You can receive your copy today by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1043] Once again, the address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1053] You know, Peter, I told one individual about the book called The Four Horsemen.
[time=1056] He says, "That's something to do with Notre Dame football." Back in the '20s, there were four famous football players at Notre Dame that they called The Four Horsemen.
[time=1065] But they actually borrowed their name from the Book of Revelation, which tells us a Four Horseman, a writer on a white horse, a red horse, a pale horse, and a black horse.
[time=1075] Wouldn't you like to know what those Four Horsemen represent and the impact they'll have on this world?
[time=1081] Well, this book will explain it in very practical, relevant, and clear terms.
[time=1086] We'd love to send you a copy as a gift from us to you to help you to dig deeper into Bible study and to help you prepare to live a godly life until Jesus Christ comes again.
[time=1098] Before we go back to our live part of our morning worship service, Pete, would you give that address one more time?
[time=1104] Yes, we want you to encourage you to write today to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815, right for this fine book today.
[time=1117] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1119] And as we go back to our morning worship service, let me encourage you to open your Bible, find the Book of 1 Thessalonians, work your fingers till you get to chapter 4, and we'll study there today about the coming rapture of Jesus Christ, the comfort that can give to you and to me is we walk through some of life's more difficult situations.
[time=1140] I've titled the message "Pole in the midst of sorrow." For there in that book, it tells us that we sorrow, but not as others who have no hope.
[time=1159] Like peering through a window blurred with rain,
[time=1167] emotions run together in a flood of doubt and pain,
[time=1178] we've prayed as best we can.
[time=1184] Now we must leave it in His hands.
[time=1189] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see,
[time=1197] He is able.
[time=1205] And even though it seems impossible to me,
[time=1212] He is able.
[time=1221] For if it changes not to move, in the way we pray we want, God forgive His working all together for our good.
[time=1236] I will stand behind His word for His neighbor.
[time=1264] Questions seem to hold us night and day.
[time=1273] How could God allow my heart be torn this way?
[time=1282] Does He listen when I call?
[time=1289] Is He even there at all?
[time=1294] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see,
[time=1302] He is able.
[time=1310] And even though it seems impossible to me,
[time=1318] He is able.
[time=1327] For if it changes not to move, in the way we pray we want, God forgive His working all together for your good.
[time=1341] I will stand behind His word for His neighbor.
[time=1386] He will stand behind His neighbor.
[time=1415] Indeed, our God is able.
[time=1417] Thank you for that reminder, Denise.
[time=1419] Let's stand now and recite this month's memory verse.
[time=1426] Revelation 4-11, "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[time=1438] For you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being." Revelation 4-11, thank you.
[time=1449] You may be seated.
[time=1452] Thank you, and I hope you make it a priority of your life to memorize God's word.
[time=1458] It will be a light under your feet and a lamp under your path.
[time=1462] Said David, "It will help you as a young person or an older person to keep your path pure.
[time=1469] It will be the strength of your life and the food for your soul." And I commend it to you not only for your reading, but for your memorizing.
[time=1479] If you have a Bible with you today, I invite you to open it to 1 Thessalonians 4, and I would like to read for you 1 Thessalonians 4-13 through chapter 5, verse 11, which will constitute our study today.
[time=1495] 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 11.
[time=1499] Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep or to grieve, like the rest of men who have no hope.
[time=1512] We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him.
[time=1524] According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
[time=1539] For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God.
[time=1551] And the dead in Christ will rise first.
[time=1556] After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[time=1567] And so we will be with the Lord forever.
[time=1572] Therefore, encourage each other with these words.
[time=1577] Now, brothers, about times and dates, we do not need to write to you.
[time=1585] For you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[time=1592] While people are saying, "Peace and safety, destruction will come on them, suddenly as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape." But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
[time=1614] You are sons of the light and sons of the day.
[time=1618] We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
[time=1622] So then, let us not be like others who are asleep,
[time=1628] but let us be alert and self-controlled.
[time=1633] For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
[time=1639] But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith as, and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
[time=1653] For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath, but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1662] He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.
[time=1670] Therefore, encourage one another and build up each other,
[time=1676] just as in fact you are doing.
[time=1680] God, we thank you for your word today, and the promises that we have heard even sung to us on this great spring morning.
[time=1691] Thank you that you are able to do exceedingly, abundantly beyond all that we ask or think.
[time=1698] Thank you that you are able to keep that which we have committed unto you.
[time=1703] Thank you that you are able to save to the utmost any who would come to you by faith, even this morning.
[time=1712] We worship you because you are able, because you are worthy, because you have created us, and we know that we exist for you, and for your pleasure, and we want to be found pleasing you.
[time=1727] We pray that each heart here today would be convinced and encouraged of heart to know that you are able.
[time=1733] We pray that you will encourage Omar Baker today to know that you are able to walk with him through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=1740] We pray that Bessie Blakely in a hospital room will know that you are able to walk with her.
[time=1746] We pray that the Zooks will know that you are able to restore a broken leg.
[time=1751] We pray today that each one who is walking through the pain of a broken relationship would know that you are able to keep them and to encourage them.
[time=1762] And now as we open up our hearts in your word, we ask you to speak in Jesus' name.
[time=1770] [AMEN] December the 7th, 1941, said Roosevelt is a day that will live in infamy.
[time=1783] That day was the event that launched the United States forces into World War II, to the European theater under Eisenhower, to the Asian theater under General Douglas Smith Arthur.
[time=1797] The Philippine Islands became a focal point, and the U.S. troops landed and they engaged the enemy.
[time=1804] But the Japanese overpowered them and drove them from island to island and finally cornered them in a narrow peninsula called Batan.
[time=1813] And there the American forces dug in and held their ground and stayed the battle.
[time=1820] But the most discouraging news came.
[time=1824] Message had come from the White House, from Roosevelt himself, that MacArthur was to be taken out of the Philippines and moved to Australia.
[time=1834] The hearts of U.S. servicemen sank.
[time=1837] The nation of the Philippines were discouraged.
[time=1842] On a March 9th in 1942, quietly a submarine emerged off of the island of Corrigador.
[time=1851] It was to take MacArthur to Australia.
[time=1855] In a final address, MacArthur said all that he could to encourage his men and to encourage the nation of the Philippines.
[time=1863] And his final words were these, "I shall return."
[time=1871] With that came the hope of a nation, came confidence to a military troop that a leader would come and that they should hold their ground and they should fight until he comes.
[time=1884] That promise was not original with General Douglas MacArthur.
[time=1888] It was Jesus who said, "Beloved, I shall return."
[time=1895] Our hope today, our reason for living, our cause is fortified because Jesus said, "I am coming again." As we have read 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, it tells us of those glorious events surrounding the day that Jesus Christ comes again.
[time=1916] It is our hope in the face of defeat.
[time=1919] It is our confidence in the face of death.
[time=1924] Jesus said, "I shall return." This morning, as we dig into the verses that we read a moment ago, I would like to share with you two major mistakes, two major events, and two major applications.
[time=1942] Whenever we talk about future events, eschatology is the theological term, Jesus coming or the great tribulation, there are two possible mistakes that we can make.
[time=1953] Mistake number one is to indulge excessively.
[time=1959] By that, I mean we can become too involved, too sensational in our study of how in the world is it going to end.
[time=1969] Since I've been a believer in Jesus Christ, I have been told that John Kennedy was the Antichrist, then Robert Kennedy was the Antichrist, then Moshe Diane was the Antichrist, then Onward Sadat was the Antichrist, then Manoc and Beggon was the Antichrist, a few people even accused me of such things.
[time=1989] And we make the mistake of reading our Bible and our newspaper and trying to read out of the newspaper, eschatological events and saying, "See, this proves Jesus is coming before my taxes are due."
[time=2005] I remember driving between here in Grace Seminary, listening on the radio as a man announced that he had deduced who the Antichrist was.
[time=2014] He had figured it out, the tragedy was that by the time he had figured it out, written his message, put it on tape, sent it to the radio stations and the radio stations had aired it, his candidate died.
[time=2030] In 1843, a Baptist minister by the name of William Miller
[time=2039] announced that he had figured out that Jesus was coming in 1843 and hundreds of his followers sold all that they had, put on white sheets and stood on their roofs so they could be the first to go when Jesus came.
[time=2054] Obviously that date in October of 1843 came and went, but Jesus didn't.
[time=2061] All of them came down off of their house.
[time=2064] Miller returned to his Texas instrument calculator, recalculated and said, "I made a mistake." It's not 1843, it's 1846.
[time=2074] The same people sold what they had purchased in the last three years, put on their same white robes, got on their roofs and waited for Jesus to come and he didn't.
[time=2084] Miller got off his roof and said the batteries went dead in this stupid calculator.
[time=2089] It's not 1846, it's 1847.
[time=2092] The same people sold what they had gained in the last year, put on their white robes, got on the roof, waited for Jesus to come and he didn't.
[time=2102] Now that's 140 plus years ago, people weren't as smart as we are today.
[time=2109] Can I tell you about one of the best sellers of the year 1988?
[time=2113] It's a book entitled "88 Reasons Why Jesus is Coming in 1988"
[time=2120] and hundreds of us bought them.
[time=2124] What is amazing is that book was on the best seller's book table in the Christian bookstores last year.
[time=2130] This year it's listed under cults.
[time=2137] You know, we all believe, at least most of us believe Jesus is coming back and I do.
[time=2144] But we can err by excessively indulging in all this and saying, "I've got this figured out and I've got that figured out." Because Daniel's image of the beast had ten toes, anything that has ten in it's got to do with the Antichrist.
[time=2159] We err greatly.
[time=2161] But there's another mistake that we make and that is to ignore it indifferently.
[time=2167] And that is to say, "Yeah, you're right, Hawks, there are a bunch of kooks out there who have figured everything out and won't even admit it when they've blown it."
[time=2177] Let's just ignore the whole thing.
[time=2180] People have been saying, "Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming, sure Jesus is coming." I don't believe it, I don't buy it.
[time=2188] God's not going to destroy the world.
[time=2190] People have been saying that for a long time, but absolutely nothing has changed.
[time=2197] Jesus said he's coming, the disciple said he's coming, but it's been pretty close to 2000 years
[time=2204] and nothing's happened yet.
[time=2206] Well, that's not an original thought.
[time=2208] People thought that in the days of the apostles, Peter wrote about the second coming of the Lord and they said the second coming of the Lord.
[time=2215] We've been hearing that for a long time and nothing's been changed.
[time=2219] Peter corrected them by saying, "Our problem is we're locked into calendars.
[time=2223] What time do you want to meet?
[time=2224] Tuesday, five o'clock, I'll be there." Because we are so limited in time because we don't have much of it, 70 years on the average.
[time=2234] God is timeless and Peter said, "A day is like a thousand years to the Lord and a thousand years is like one day." And according to God's timetable, we could say it's only been two days, 2000 years, two of God's days since Jesus went.
[time=2252] So what if he waits another week or two?
[time=2254] Doesn't mean he's not coming.
[time=2257] One of the mistakes we make is to ignore it indifferently.
[time=2262] Previous generations have ignored God's warning.
[time=2265] God warned in the days of Noah that he was going to destroy the world.
[time=2269] He was going to send rain.
[time=2271] He had never seen rain.
[time=2273] He was going to flood the earth.
[time=2275] They had never seen a flood.
[time=2276] But God said it's going to happen and they didn't believe it until they were up to their eyeballs in a flood.
[time=2283] In the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, God said through a lot, "I'm going to destroy these two cities and people laugh and say, "Eat, be, marry, drink all you want.
[time=2292] It's fiesta time.
[time=2293] Let's party forever all night long." And suddenly destruction came.
[time=2299] He had everything going great in his life.
[time=2302] He looked at his crop and it was a bumper crop and he said, "Hm, I'm really going to make this agribusiness take off.
[time=2308] I'm going to tear down that barn and that silo.
[time=2311] I'm going to enlarge that green bin.
[time=2313] I'm going to build bigger." And Jesus said, "What does it matter?
[time=2316] Because tonight your soul is going to be required of you." And he ignored that warning.
[time=2323] One man wanted to live with a warning and he had these words on his tombstone.
[time=2329] After I mentioned it last hour several people said they've seen this on grave markers themselves.
[time=2335] This tombstone reads, "Pause my friend as you walk by.
[time=2341] As you are now, so once was I.
[time=2346] As I am now, so you will be.
[time=2350] Prepare my friend to follow me." We do not well to sensationalize the events of the Second Coming, but we err even more greatly if we scoff at those events and ignore them.
[time=2365] Two major events are spelled out here for us in 1 Thessalonians 4 and 5.
[time=2370] The first event is what we call in Bible language the rapture of the church.
[time=2377] That's found in 1 Thessalonians 4 verses 13 through 18.
[time=2382] We're first introduced to a situation.
[time=2386] It's found in verse 13, "Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant." Let me clarify.
[time=2392] Those of us who want to brother in seminaries are not the only ones who are ignorant.
[time=2397] That's not the reference here.
[time=2399] We do not want you to be ignorant about those who have fallen asleep are de-grieved like the rest of men who have no hope.
[time=2407] Here was the situation.
[time=2409] Paul had told them that Jesus was coming again and they were excited.
[time=2414] But a little bit of time went by and this one's father died.
[time=2419] That one's grandparents passed away.
[time=2422] That one had a spouse who just died.
[time=2426] These people lost a child.
[time=2429] They said, "If Jesus comes, what happens to them?
[time=2433] Do they miss out on heaven?
[time=2435] Do they miss out on all the excitement of Christ's return?
[time=2438] Are they lost forever?" Paul wants to correct and encourage that situation.
[time=2445] And so he gives this explanation.
[time=2447] There are four sequential events around his explanation that we call the rapture.
[time=2455] Event number one is this.
[time=2457] First, Christ will return.
[time=2462] The next event on God's timetable for the earth is the return of Christ and in this passage it only tells us about the first part of his return.
[time=2472] He doesn't come to earth in this passage.
[time=2475] He doesn't come to rain or rule.
[time=2477] He actually comes to the clouds.
[time=2481] His coming is announced with a shout by the voice of an archangel
[time=2487] and by the blast of a trumpet on the trumpet of God.
[time=2492] Whether that's heard in heaven or whether it's heard on earth, we can't say definitively.
[time=2497] Whether believers will hear it, unbelievers will not hear it, we don't know.
[time=2502] Whether the whole world will know.
[time=2506] But we do know that he is going to announce his coming.
[time=2511] When he announces that coming he will come to the air.
[time=2516] That leads to the second event and it says the dead in Christ will be raised.
[time=2524] Now this very moment, anyone who has died in Christ is already in heaven.
[time=2529] Not their bodies, but their spirits.
[time=2532] Remember Jesus said to the thief on the cross, "This day you'll be with me in paradise."
[time=2538] Not after thousands of years of soul sleep are not after millennia of unconsciousness,
[time=2544] but this day you'll be with me.
[time=2548] Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 9 that when we die we are absent from this body
[time=2554] we're present with the Lord.
[time=2556] So if you've lost a loved one, they're right now in heaven.
[time=2559] They're right now with Jesus.
[time=2561] They're right now alive and enjoying paradise.
[time=2565] But their body, like the body of John Brown, lies a smoldering in the grave.
[time=2572] But there's coming a day when Jesus is coming and their dead bodies are all going to be resurrected.
[time=2580] That poses a whole lot of skepticism and theological debate.
[time=2585] Well what happens to the body of those people?
[time=2587] Let's say who went through a fire and their body was marred or completely destroyed.
[time=2591] What happens to those people who were buried before the modern technology of embalming and they are decomposed?
[time=2598] All that is put together in one dramatic illustration of the separatist Roger Williams who was buried under his favorite apple tree.
[time=2607] Later on some of his followers thought he deserved a better grave sight and they exhumed him,
[time=2613] only to find that the apple tree's roots grew down and actually tapped into the body of Roger Williams
[time=2620] and assimilated him.
[time=2622] Now the theological problem is this, if you ate an apple off of that apple tree did you eat Roger Williams?
[time=2629] And in that resurrection morning that is called that great get nut morning, are you going to be missing a bite out of your right arm or is Roger going to be missing a chunk out of his left ear?
[time=2640] Deep theological questions.
[time=2644] Well did you know that since you have entered into this room, your body has already reproduced and replaced millions and millions of cells?
[time=2655] You're not the same you that you were when you came in here.
[time=2659] You said I thought I felt a little different.
[time=2662] And you see God's not going to reconstruct your exact body molecule by molecule atom by atom.
[time=2670] He is going to resurrect you because he's got your blueprint, your DNA RNA in his eternal mind
[time=2679] is greater than any computer and he'll just say Bill and Patty and Steve and Ed and Walene and Gary and Bob
[time=2686] come back alive and he's going to create you brand new but it's going to be you.
[time=2692] And he can do that.
[time=2694] The third event that he explains is after he resurrects the dead then the living will be, here's what the Bible says, caught up.
[time=2704] That Latin word for caught up is rapio, our repeat we are rapdom in its fourth principal part.
[time=2711] And out of that word rapdom we get our word rapture.
[time=2716] It is when God actually grabs those of us who are believers in Christ alive and takes us to heaven.
[time=2723] Most of the artist depictions I've seen of this are kind of like in slow motion.
[time=2727] You know you see these bodies kind of going like the six million dollar man in the space to meet Jesus.
[time=2733] Actually the Bible tells it's going to be in the moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[time=2738] You know like money here today gone tomorrow just zoom it's gone.
[time=2743] Kenneth Wiest is a fine biblical scholar and he's looked at this Greek word and he said this word caught up
[time=2749] is used at least in these five different ways.
[time=2752] To catch away speedily like rescuing someone who's about to be burnt in a fire.
[time=2758] It's used to take something by force like a military conquest coming in and taking over a fort.
[time=2765] It's used thirdly to claim something for ourselves like two children eyeing the same toy and rushing for it.
[time=2772] And one gets there first and grabs it and says mine.
[time=2776] Fourthly it's used to move to a new place.
[time=2780] We just got a dog by the name of spotlight.
[time=2784] Having a garage sale I suggest we put spotlight in the garage sale but I was out voted four to one.
[time=2791] We used to leisurely sit on the floor and eat our popcorn and drink our diet Pepsi and watch TV.
[time=2798] No more.
[time=2800] We can do that when the spotlight is out in the backyard but if somebody lets her in suddenly the rapture occurs in the hoxels.
[time=2807] You grab anything edible and you grab it and you hold it up high because if you don't you'll lose it.
[time=2814] And God says I'm going to grab you and take you to a new spot.
[time=2818] The fifth possible meaning of the word is to rescue from danger.
[time=2823] Like a military army that storms and releases the hostage out of danger.
[time=2830] The third event is that God says only will he resurrect the dead but he'll take the living.
[time=2837] The fourth event is this.
[time=2839] It says then we will be together with the Lord.
[time=2848] There is some illustration of that because if you're the least bit prone to skepticism you've got to say let me get this right hox.
[time=2856] There's going to come a day we're going to look up in the clouds we're going to see this cloud and wouldn't you know there's going to be Jesus and this angel with a trumpet.
[time=2863] And then right past me going to be dead bodies flying every which way.
[time=2868] And then all of a sudden people are just going to who are alive are going to go bing bing bing bing.
[time=2873] That's a real hard one for me to believe.
[time=2876] Well if God illustrated that for you then would you believe it?
[time=2881] Look at the verse 14 and 15 and verses 14 and 15 it says this.
[time=2887] We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep according to his own word.
[time=2900] You see Jesus died and when he was put in the grave God had the power.
[time=2909] The resurrection power to bring Jesus back out of the grave.
[time=2914] And not only did he do that but did you notice in Matthew chapter 27 when Christ died on the cross there was a rumbling of the earth and the graves were opened.
[time=2925] Did you notice that little detail and did you notice after Christ was resurrected those open graves people came out of them alive.
[time=2933] Why did God do that so you and I could sit here today and say if he did it once why should we doubt that he could do it again.
[time=2943] It's like the individual who lost ten dollars betting on a football game.
[time=2949] He wasn't real bright and he lost ten more on the instant replay.
[time=2954] He couldn't believe the same team could lose twice. A smarter man would say if it happened once it could happen again.
[time=2963] And if Jesus was raised from the dead sure he can raise the dead bodies of those that we love.
[time=2969] Then he brings that to an application. His application is found at the beginning and at the end.
[time=2976] In verse 18 he says therefore encourage each other with these words. How are these words meant to encourage us?
[time=2984] Well back to verse 13 that we would not sorrow as others who have no hope.
[time=2993] You see if you die without Christ you die hopelessly.
[time=2999] And if you have lost somebody and you don't know Christ you lose them hopelessly.
[time=3006] But if you die and you know Christ and they know Christ you do not die without hope.
[time=3013] You die with the sadness, the sorrow and the grief that they're gone but the hope that it's not forever.
[time=3022] It's just I'll see you a little later.
[time=3028] Fidor Del Saveschi wrote these words about hopelessness.
[time=3033] "Totally without hope one cannot live. To live without hope is deceased to live. Hell is hopelessness.
[time=3043] It is no accident that above the entrance to Dante's Hell is the inscription.
[time=3049] Leave behind all hope you who enter."
[time=3055] In sharp contrast to those words are the great words of hope that we will be caught up alive with those who have died and together we will be with the Lord.
[time=3070] A man was comforting another man by saying I was sorry that you lost your wife. He said I didn't lose her.
[time=3079] You can't lose something if you know where it's at and I know where she's at.
[time=3087] That is one of the two major events we call it, the Rapture of Believers. The second major event is found in chapter 5 verses 1 through 11 we call it the Wrath of God.
[time=3102] The description is found in verses 1 and 2 where it is called the Day of the Lord.
[time=3109] By the phrase Day of the Lord it's used both in Old Testament and New Testament. I commend for your future reading Isaiah chapter 13 verses 9 through 13 where it tells us some of the catastrophic terrible days that are coming in the Day of the Lord.
[time=3126] The Day of the Lord is not a 12 hour light part of a day. It's not even a 24 hour day. It's an epic, an era, a coming event and the book of Revelation calls the Day of the Lord the Day of the Great Tribulation.
[time=3142] And we're told in Daniel and in Revelation that it lasts seven years. But it's designation here is the Day of the Lord. The date is given. It's given to be a secret.
[time=3157] It says now brothers about times and dates we do not need to write to you for you know well that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[time=3167] There have been countless people we've alluded to several who said oh I know when it is I figured it out. When anybody says they've got it figured out you know that's your clue that they haven't got it figured out.
[time=3181] Because here it says no one knows because it's like a thief in the night. The whole point of this is if you knew that at Saturday night at 1130 p.m. a thief was coming to your house.
[time=3195] You would probably plan on being home. You would plan on probably having the police there. Plan on protecting your family and your property.
[time=3205] You might be like that almish friend of mine who woke up in the middle of the night found someone breaking into his home went downstairs got his squirrel hunting rifle and pointed it right at the thief and said halt.
[time=3216] They'll know I be almish. They'll know I be against violence but they'll stand is where I'm about to shoot.
[time=3227] If you knew when the thief was coming you would say I'll be prepared.
[time=3234] The whole point of it is you don't know when the thief comes and you don't know when Jesus will come and it shouldn't be any surprise to them because Christ had said it twice before.
[time=3245] Nobody knows when it's going to be. He tells them about the danger. There are two dangers.
[time=3253] The danger is that you might not be a believer in Jesus Christ and he may come and you'll be unprepared and you may be sitting there and suddenly it happens and your last opportunity to escape the great tribulation is gone.
[time=3274] The first danger is that you may not know Christ. You may have scoffed at all of this and it's real and someday it won't be eschatology, it will be history and you may be caught in the crossfire of time.
[time=3290] But there's a second danger to which he alludes and that is the danger that you may know Christ but you may be found unfaithful to him at his coming.
[time=3299] He talks about those who are children of the light and those who are children of darkness.
[time=3304] He talks about those who are of the day and those who are of the night. He talks about those who are awake and vigilant on those who are asleep.
[time=3313] The point of all this is that if you believe that you are a follower of Christ you need to follow him and you need to doubly commit yourself if you believe he's coming again.
[time=3324] Therefore you need to be like a man on guard duty so bear alert and awake.
[time=3330] You should not be like the person who says I'm on the three to three shift. I said the three to three shift and what's that?
[time=3337] He said I sleep from three in the morning to three in the afternoon and from three in the afternoon to three in the morning I party.
[time=3345] God says don't be like those who are of the night. They sleep and God's not putting down sleep but he's saying don't sleep your life away.
[time=3354] Be alert. Be awake. Don't be of the night.
[time=3358] Isn't it interesting that God said two thousand years ago that those who get drunk get drunk in the night.
[time=3364] That's when the festive party mentality takes over and somebody thinks they're a real slick ad-de-man when they said the night belongs to Mickelhobe.
[time=3373] It wasn't very original. I'd even consider that plagiaristic.
[time=3378] There are three encouragementsments to those of us who are believers in the face of this danger. One be a child of the day.
[time=3386] Don't sleep your life away. Be alert is the second encouragement and be sober which means to be on guard duty with self-control.
[time=3399] My grandfather used to say there are three types of people in the world. Those who make things happen. Those who watch things happen and those who wonder what happened.
[time=3409] Jesus is saying don't be in the third group. Don't even be in the second group. Be sober. Be alert.
[time=3416] Be vigilant till he comes. Let me pull this now to two specific applications around the word deliverance in verses 9 through 11.
[time=3430] Specific application number one is this remember you will have tribulation but you won't have the great tribulation.
[time=3436] It says for God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation. We can take the wrath to mean eternal hell and salvation to mean heaven.
[time=3446] But that's not the context. The wrath is the great day of the Lord. And the salvation is what he told us in chapter 4. He's going to rescue us.
[time=3455] If you're a theologian that's called the pre-tribulational rapture and I only believe it I love it. Jesus says I'm going to rescue you and I'm going to save you.
[time=3464] And I think it's impossible to accurately interpret these verses different than anything other than the fact you may have some hard times but you're going to miss the worst of them.
[time=3473] He's going to take the church out before the day of the Lord. And the second application is verse 11. Therefore encourage one another, build up each other as in fact you're already doing.
[time=3484] What he's saying is this it's too soon to quit. Jesus is coming. Hang in there. Fight the good fight.
[time=3514] We've been sharing with you today the music of our sanctuary choir celebration and soloist Denise Mitchell. The message from our pastor was a message of encouragement today as we realize that Jesus Christ indeed is going to return for those that love him.
[time=3529] I wonder do you love Jesus Christ and have you accepted him as your personal Savior? If you haven't you can pray this prayer and accept him into your heart. Would you bow and pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that you set your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3547] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and save me for Jesus' sake. Amen.
[time=3559] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision. And then when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3571] To receive a copy of your decision or the book mentioned earlier entitled "Approaching Hookbeats" please write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
