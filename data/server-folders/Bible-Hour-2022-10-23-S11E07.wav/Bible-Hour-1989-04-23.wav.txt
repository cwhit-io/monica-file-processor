[time=30] Kindness is one of the qualities that should be characteristic in the life of a Christian.
[time=42] Mark Twain tells this story about kindness.
[time=45] A man sat across the table from a banker pleading for a loan to save his family farm.
[time=52] The banker who had one glass eye said to the needy fellow, "I'll tell you what, if you can tell me which of my two eyes is the glass one, I'll give you that loan."
[time=63] The man responded, "Sir, I believe it's the one with a hint of kindness."
[time=69] (music) Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=87] Thank you for joining us.
[time=89] Today Rick is continuing his series from the book of First Thessalonians with a message entitled "Three Germs That Make Us Contagious." His cooperation and compassion are some of the winsome qualities that are brought to our attention in the closing verses of First Thessalonians.
[time=107] As our months of study draw to a close, it is important that we not miss these significant final instructions.
[time=114] Please open your Bible and your hearts to examine God's Word with us here today on the Bible Hour.
[time=121] Rick's text is taken from First Thessalonians, chapter 5, verses 12 through 22.
[time=127] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=132] Other special music includes a song from the Men's Singers Quartet and Kathy Hawks.
[time=141] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=150] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=154] Now, here's Rick.
[time=156] Rick, we want to thank you and welcome you to Black Hawk today and also welcome our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=163] We trust that as we sing praises this morning, that will not only praise God because He's holy, but will be compelled in our life to live holy so that we might please Him.
[time=186] Holy is He, and great is His glory.
[time=202] Holy is He, and worthy of our praise.
[time=214] I stand in His presence of His, and proudly with worship and praise, holy is He, holy
[time=232] is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy
[time=232] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 146 seconds] is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy...
[time=403] [MUSIC - 155 seconds]
[time=575] (audience chattering) - Such a marvelous piece.
[time=580] I hope that you picked out some of the words and claimed them for your own.
[time=583] The first verse said, "Who pardons my iniquities, "who heals me from within, who lifts my fallen life "and sets me on my feet again." What a great comfort to know that when we're down, God can pick us up and set us a right and we can go on living for Him.
[time=600] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness, Him number 404.
[time=607] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=610] Sing it with great confidence, will you, as we sing this great hymn.
[time=613] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=693] (upbeat music)
[time=723] [MUSIC]
[time=728] - Thank you again for your good singing.
[time=732] I hope that you inspired your neighbor as you sang those praises today.
[time=737] We continue with music now.
[time=738] As Kathy Hawks comes to minister to us, let's listen as she sings.
[time=742] (upbeat music)
[time=753] [MUSIC - 241 seconds]
[time=1006] (gentle music) - Thank you again for joining us here today
[time=1030] for the Bible Hour.
[time=1032] We hope that God uses these moments together to strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1038] Or if you haven't made your commitment to Christ yet, as a searcher, you'll come to discover that he is your Lord and he is your savior.
[time=1047] Thanks again for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1050] Pete, how is your family on this delightful weekend?
[time=1053] - Well, just fine, Rick.
[time=1054] We're busy getting prepared for the children's musical.
[time=1058] That'll be coming up this Sunday night, as a matter of fact, as this is aired on April 30th.
[time=1062] - Well, as they had that special practice on Thursday night, I had two girls that were excited.
[time=1067] When we picked them up, they sang the music all the way home.
[time=1071] Well, they had a good rehearsal that night and the musical involves about 71 of our kids, so it's a great group of young people.
[time=1079] - And the name of it again is, "The Bible Tells Me So Show." I remember that now.
[time=1085] Well, we do want to encourage your friends in the Fort Wayne area to consider coming Sunday night.
[time=1090] April 30th, and enjoy a children's musical.
[time=1094] It's a delightful time to see children developing and learning to express their musical talent, but most of all, their love for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1102] And your wife is one of the directors.
[time=1105] - Cheryl's been busy being very much involved in it, as well as Jennifer Vaughn.
[time=1109] They work well together, and I think the program is going to be exciting for the people in a good learning experience, too.
[time=1116] - Well, my kids have already profited by it much, so thank you. - Thank you.
[time=1120] We want to encourage you, who are looking for an opportunity to grow spiritually, to join us this summer for the Summer Bible Conference here at Blackhawk.
[time=1129] It's on Wednesday nights at seven o'clock, and in many ways, it is the highlight of our summer, as we open up God's Word and study it together.
[time=1139] This year, we're particularly looking forward to beginning the Summer Bible Conference with a very well-received film called "A Man Called Norman." This film tells the story of Christian compassion and kindness.
[time=1153] Perhaps you've heard of this film from people like Dr. James Dobson in his ministry, Focus on the Family.
[time=1160] The film "A Man Called Norman" is a fresh challenge for each of us as Christians to examine our hearts and our compassion towards those who may be less fortunate than we ourselves.
[time=1171] We want to encourage you to set June the 7th at seven o'clock, that Wednesday night aside, to join us here.
[time=1178] And we'll look forward to some music each night with the Summer Bible Conference as well.
[time=1182] I like the variety that the Summer Bible Conference allows us to have, and many of our people will be singing on that night.
[time=1190] It's just a good time of fellowship in the midweek to be encouraged and really put on the cloak of praise for that night.
[time=1196] I'm looking forward to it, and hope you can join us.
[time=1200] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, we have a booklet we've been sharing with you during this month of April.
[time=1207] Its title is called "Approaching Hoofbeats-- The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse." This excellent book is authored by Dr. Billy Graham, whom I know needs no introduction to you.
[time=1220] Dr. Graham in this book is outlining for us the events of the end times as they are penned by the Apostle John in the book of Revelation.
[time=1231] The Four Horsemen represent four different judgments of God that will be poured out on the earth during that time we call the Great Tribulation.
[time=1242] Over the past few Sundays, we've been talking about the Second Coming of the Lord, and this book does a great job filling in some of the details that we've not been able to cover in our Sunday morning studies.
[time=1255] We'd love to send you a copy as a gift from us to you if you'll simply write and ask for it.
[time=1261] You can receive this book by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1272] Once again, that's the Bible hour.
[time=1274] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1280] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for "The Bible Hour."
[time=1286] [MUSIC]
[time=1291] When no one cared about me if I should live or die,
[time=1298] and no one bothered ask me why I go alone and cry.
[time=1306] When burdens got so heavy that I could not face the day,
[time=1314] then I feel his arms around me, and I hear him gently say,
[time=1321] lean on me when you have no strength to stand.
[time=1329] When you feel you're going under, hold tighter to my hand,
[time=1335] lean on me when your heart begins to lead.
[time=1343] When you come to the place that I'm all you have, then you'll find I'm all you need.
[time=1353] When the road of it seems rugged and the path is getting steep, I feel that I can't make it,
[time=1364] and my heart begins to be.
[time=1368] Then I turn to see who's coming to join me in the way.
[time=1375] Then I see that it's my Savior, and I hear him gently say,
[time=1382] lean on me when you have no strength to stand.
[time=1390] When you feel you're going under, hold tighter to my hand,
[time=1396] lean on me when your heart begins to lead.
[time=1404] When you come to the place that I'm all you have, then you'll find I'm all you need.
[time=1413] Lean on me when you have no strength to stand.
[time=1421] When you feel you're going under, hold tighter to my hand,
[time=1428] lean on me when your heart begins to lead.
[time=1435] When you come to the place that I'm all you have, then you'll find I'm all you need.
[time=1444] When you come to the place that I'm all you have,
[time=1452] then you'll find I'm all you.
[time=1459] I'm all you need.
[time=1482] Thank you, men. I would like to take just a moment to explain one of the announcements in our bulletin. I'm very cautious not to use our church as a political action group. I believe that as believers in Christ, we need to be greatly involved in the social and political arenas of our society.
[time=1503] Not as a pastor, but as a private citizen. I take great involvement in the government of our state and in our country.
[time=1511] That's a priority in my life and in Cathies.
[time=1514] But I also believe that this is a church and our ministry is Bible teaching and gospel preaching and do not often suggest that we do things that are of a political or social nature. But there are issues and there are events that are not easily divided between that which is spiritual and that which is political. There are events that stand in both corners.
[time=1537] Nothing is more true than abortion of being in both camps.
[time=1544] I believe that it is the clear teaching of Scripture that life begins in the womb at conception.
[time=1551] I believe and it is my position that abortion is the taking of a human life.
[time=1558] My sister was over a few weeks ago and gave me this illustration.
[time=1562] A lady, six months pregnant, went to the doctor, explained to the doctor that she needed an abortion.
[time=1568] She had thought about it. They had one little girl who was two years old and they had thought about it. They only wanted one child.
[time=1576] They could only afford one child. They never wanted a second child and they could not handle two. The doctor said fine.
[time=1584] You just leave that little two-year-old here and go home and have this baby.
[time=1588] I'll take care of the two-year-old.
[time=1592] I believe that that analogy has a potent point.
[time=1595] That we need to regard life in the womb as sacred as a two-year-old
[time=1601] sitting in a waiting room.
[time=1604] I believe that we have a responsibility as a society
[time=1610] to structure our laws as a watchword.
[time=1613] And so in our bulletin I've encouraged you to write to government leaders and particularly at this time to justices on our Supreme Court.
[time=1621] I do not believe that that is a political issue.
[time=1624] I believe that it is primarily a spiritual issue.
[time=1628] I also believe that changing the laws will not change our society.
[time=1633] People do not change because laws change. Change will come when a nation
[time=1639] develops a conscience. Change will come when people discover that there are principles to govern their sexual conduct and that abortion is not an after-the-fact contraception.
[time=1652] Change will come when people discover that there need to be obedient to God in their sexual lives. And the greatest effect we could have on the abortion issue
[time=1664] is to teach God's word to women and women to Christ.
[time=1668] Yet I also believe that it's important that we change laws because a law becomes a watchword for a society that as a generation grows up they look to the law to tell them what is ethical and what is appropriate.
[time=1683] And so I encourage you in these days to write.
[time=1686] It has been said and rightfully so all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
[time=1696] I will cautiously encourage you in this sensitive area of balancing our voice in this community as a church and a religious group and our voice as it reflects those things that are of a political nature.
[time=1709] But this is an issue that I believe is spiritual.
[time=1712] It is biblical. It is not partisan. It is not endorsing a candidate.
[time=1717] It is speaking what I believe the word of God teaches so clearly.
[time=1721] Well that's an announcement. Would you power with me and pray and then we'll teach God's word from Thessalonians today?
[time=1728] God we're thankful for our country and we're so often victims of our own self-criticism we don't take the time to thank you for this country.
[time=1738] For the great men and women who have protected it on the military front
[time=1744] who have led it on the political front and who've labored in our community on the social front. We thank you. We thank you for our freedom to worship
[time=1754] today. We thank you for my freedom to speak a voice of conscience in this land. We thank you for the prosperity that we know through an economic system that rewards work and we pray for guidance. Not just for our leaders but for the people
[time=1774] that there would come a hunger for holiness and appetite for sanctification in our land.
[time=1780] We pray that you would give revival not the revival testimony of select personality but the revival of a people who will live godly and so today as we study your word we ask you to be the one to teach us. We ask you to give us insight for living. We pray today for justices who will rule in the Missouri case and how it may affect a 1972 ruling.
[time=1809] God we ask you to reshape our country's ethic and its morality and even as we speak we pray for those who have aired and they have had children out of wedlock.
[time=1821] May they know your forgiveness. May that mother or that father who have been partners in abortion know today that that can be forgiven help them to know that they're wanted and accepted in the body of Christ that that sin too is forgivable. We pray today for those who would hear even that prayer that they would not take future forgiveness as a license for sin today.
[time=1849] Father as we open your word we ask you to feed us.
[time=1853] We ask you to comfort those who cannot be here particularly for Catherine Northrop and Bessie Blakely and Virgil Kelly as they fight for health in a hospital room and with our strength we meet today
[time=1867] but we have learned through song that our strength is the Lord and we've come to lean on you through your word in Jesus name.
[time=1875] [AMEN] In four short years 1347 to 1351 a germ
[time=1888] bacteria by the name of the bubani plague swept through Europe. One person contagiously affected another and that one another until one fourth of the
[time=1903] population was exterminated by the Black Death.
[time=1910] 25 million people died from that contagious infectious disease
[time=1917] in four short years. Wouldn't it be exciting if instead of
[time=1923] disease that joy was contagious? Wouldn't it be wonderful if an act of kindness infected one person and caused them to be kind
[time=1933] to the next person and in an infectious way we could spread love and peace and joy through 25 million lives in an
[time=1942] epidemic way? Wouldn't it be marvelous if our Christianity
[time=1948] was contagious? Open your Bible please to first Thessalonians chapter five
[time=1955] I would like to read for us verses 12 through 22 Chuck Swindall speaking on this passage called it the germ that makes us contagious. That title was so contagious I had to steal it today. First Thessalonians five verse 12.
[time=1972] Now we ask you brothers to respect those who work hard among you who are
[time=1978] over you and the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in
[time=1986] love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.
[time=1994] And we urge you brothers or those who are idle encourage the timid. Help the weak. Be patient with
[time=2006] everyone. Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else. Be joyful always. Pray continually.
[time=2024] Give thanks in all circumstances for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not put out the Spirit's fire.
[time=2036] Do not treat prophecies with contempt. Test everything.
[time=2040] Hold on to the good. Avoid every kind of evil.
[time=2048] Well this morning and next Sunday morning I would like us to examine three germs that make us contagious. This morning we'll just get to look at
[time=2058] two of those germs but first some thoughts of overview on this passage. First of all this passage is given because there are those who had misapplied the teaching that Jesus Christ was coming again. Last week we looked at verse 4 or chapter 4 verses 13 through chapter 5 verse 12 and we discovered that it
[time=2082] teaches us there that Jesus is coming again.
[time=2086] But there were those that misapplied that they said Jesus is coming again soon. How soon? Very soon. Oh that's good. I think I'll quit my job since
[time=2097] Jesus is coming soon. I don't think I'll make my house payment since Jesus is coming soon. It was much like my senior year at the
[time=2108] University of Akron. The professor announced at the beginning of that last quarter that they would take our mid-term grade
[time=2118] and use that as our final grade and we would not have to take finals unless we wanted to. That was a decision that required very little prayer on my part. And as soon as I took the mid-term
[time=2132] solved the grade and was satisfied with that my brain shut down.
[time=2139] I not only failed to bring pencil and paper to class I felt only necessary to bring my body to class rarely.
[time=2149] I was out of here. It was over. The end was coming
[time=2155] and I didn't have to take the final. In many ways these Christians said Jesus is coming soon and they quit functioning.
[time=2165] When the response should have been Jesus is coming soon I ought to double my effort. As Paul said be you therefore steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.
[time=2178] And so as Paul gives them that clear teaching that Christ is coming he ended it with seventeen some imperatives, commands.
[time=2189] I only spent a few hours in the military. It was enough to discover they've never heard the word suggestion. Every instruction came as a
[time=2199] command and imperative and I don't remember the words please or thank you ever being uttered.
[time=2206] Paul takes a very military profile and he ushers seventeen instructions for them to live in light of the fact that Jesus
[time=2216] Christ was returning. None of them said quit.
[time=2220] None of them said kick back. To try to organize my thoughts in our study I've
[time=2226] circled three different themes, three germs that make us contagious, the germ
[time=2232] of cooperation, the germ of compassion and the germ of character.
[time=2238] Look at verses 12, 13 and 14 for the germ of cooperation.
[time=2244] Now we ask you brothers to respect those who work hard among you who are over you and the Lord and who admonish you hold them in the highest regard in love because of their labor. Live in peace with
[time=2260] each other. The emphasis of these commands and these verses is to develop a peaceful cooperative team spirit within the body of Christ. He first gives a threefold instruction
[time=2276] our description to those who would lead. First he says those who work hard among you. In the body of Christ most of us have some leadership responsibility not just those who have a job like mine or elders or deacons whom you have elected but you may have leadership over a home bible study.
[time=2299] You may have leadership as a ministry team leader.
[time=2302] You may have leadership as someone who organizes a nursery or acquire our second grade Sunday school class or many leaders not just myself and a leader is someone who begins by their efforts of work. The word here for work is not described the position or the place as much as it does the effort and the initiative. It's a word that describes that which is produced by perspiration and sweat. It's a labor that makes one weary.
[time=2337] Leaders are to lead by working hard. Secondly leaders are to be over
[time=2344] others in the Lord. Most of us as humans find it difficult to
[time=2350] submit to someone else. These people no doubt had a difficulty for one particular reason. They were all new Christians.
[time=2359] There weren't any people in the church of Thessaloniki who had been Christians for five, ten, fifteen years. There was no one that said I grew up in a Christian home. Nobody said I attended Fort Wayne Bible College and I had a class on this. Let me tell you how it is.
[time=2375] They were all brand new believers. People Paul had won to Christ in a less than one month visit and now he was gone.
[time=2383] No doubt there would be those that say, "You, why are you telling me what to do?
[time=2387] You haven't been at this anymore and I am. You're not my boss. I know as much as you do." Yet a leader was to lead by being in a position
[time=2399] of leadership. One of the greatest disasters of this era
[time=2405] is the shortage of leaders. One man has rightfully said
[time=2412] that now leaders instead of trying to lead from the front are trying to lead from the middle. Before they make a leadership decision they first have to take a survey in a poll and find out what the people want and then they announce what their decision is. I'm all for information and input and
[time=2429] working from consensus is wonderful but there comes a time when there's a need for decisiveness and for leadership. Someone said, "There they go. I better hurry and catch up. I'm their leader." In many ways that describes too many
[time=2444] churches and organizations and then leaders are described as those who admonish. The word admonish has a two-fold emphasis.
[time=2453] On the one hand it's a very gentle word that speaks about encouraging.
[time=2459] On the other hand it is a very corrective word that speaks of warning and correction. And leaders are to do both. They are to positively encourage and they are also to correct and instruct.
[time=2477] Again the Thessalonians would struggle with someone giving instruction.
[time=2481] Why are you telling me what I should be doing? You're not perfect yourself.
[time=2487] Perfection does not come with any number of years or any number of degrees or any number of offices. It comes only in heaven. We are all sinful. We all struggle and yet we all need to be warned and to be instructed.
[time=2503] And so with those who would be leading there would also be those who would following and the great need for that body was for a cooperative spirit between the two.
[time=2515] I'm so thankful today to teach this, to teach it out of the context of studying through Thessalonians. This is not a corrective message.
[time=2523] We do not have an us them mentality in our church.
[time=2526] There are not few people and board members in animosity between the two.
[time=2531] We do not sit in our staff meeting and talk about those dirty double crossing deacons very often. There is unity in this body.
[time=2541] And so we're just studying principles today.
[time=2544] Don't go home and say I wonder what happened that we didn't hear about Mildred. Let's call some others and find out.
[time=2552] There are no secrets. There are no problems.
[time=2556] And so this is not on the correction instruction side of admonishing. This is
[time=2562] on the encouraging side of saying well done.
[time=2566] Keep going. We've made it a consistent prayer in this church and God has answered that that he has maintained the unity of the body in the bond of peace. There is in this plea for cooperation some
[time=2581] instructions to those that follow. The first says respect those verse 12 who work hard among you begins with respect.
[time=2592] It follows with a similar phrase hold in high regard.
[time=2598] The book of 1 Timothy says that if an elder rules well he is worthy of a double honor and that an accusation should not be received against someone who is served as an elder except that it's been confirmed by two or three witnesses.
[time=2614] The point of all that is those who are serving in spiritual leadership and again I'm not speaking of my position any more than yours if you're leading in a home bible study or teaching a Sunday school class is that you are to be honoring them and you are to be respecting them and to hold them in high regard.
[time=2636] It's easy for conflict to develop because most of us are pretty strong.
[time=2642] We all have our own ideas and our own will and occasionally we butt heads and the respect and the honoring comes tough.
[time=2651] Two such men were Martin Luther and Zwingley who saw eye to eye on so many
[time=2657] things in the Reformation but but it heads on certain issues. Zwingley was angry in his spirit and he went out into the hills of Switzerland to think and as he was thinking he looked across and he could see two rams coming towards each other on a very narrow mountain pass and as they drew close to each other they could not slip by the narrow pass and they backed up and Zwingley said he anticipated that they would butt and ram each other and they backed up and the one on the higher side of the mountain dropped his head and then his feet and he laid down
[time=2698] and he allowed the other ram to walk over him and then stood and went on his way. Zwingley said God did send me a message
[time=2710] from his earth to honor and to respect someone in leadership. The greatest need of the body of
[time=2720] Christ is for us to hang in there together. Benjamin Franklin said to the
[time=2727] delegates who were signing the Declaration of Independence gentlemen we must hang together for if we do not we shall surely hang separately. We need to hang together. We need to love each other and to
[time=2744] cooperate with each other. A man by the name of George Morris wrote these words a song for our banner the watchword recall which gave the republic her station united we stand divided we fall it makes and preserves a nation.
[time=2762] The union of lakes the union of lands the union of states none can sever the union of hearts the union of hands the flag of our union forever. Cooperation united we stand and divided we fall.
[time=2781] The book of Ecclesiastes gives this time this morning about the need to hang together. It says that a three fold cord cannot easily be broken and what a cord there is when there's a believer
[time=2796] in Christ in fellowship with other believers in Christ and they are in fellowship with the Spirit of God that is a three fold cord that cannot easily be broken.
[time=2808] Paul said one germ that will make this body contagious is the germ of cooperation that we love each other.
[time=2817] You know cooperation comes easy one things are going right but it's more necessary when things are not. When Melborn was prime minister he said to the press I need your support and the press responded when you're right we give you your support.
[time=2835] Melborn said one more right we don't need your support it's one more wrong that we need it.
[time=2842] Do you know there comes a time in an organization when it is right and it's moving and it's easy to respect and honor.
[time=2852] There comes a time when there's been a mistake there's been an oversight there's been an error that's when that organization needs your response of cooperation all the more.
[time=2864] The second germ that makes us contagious the germ of compassion verse 15 verse 14 excuse me and we urge you
[time=2876] brothers six imperatives warn those who are idle
[time=2882] encourage the timid help the weak be patient with everyone make sure that no one pays back wrong for wrong but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.
[time=2896] All of these six commands cluster around the general theme of being compassionate with each other one at a time they are warn the idle the word idle means somebody who in a military fashion
[time=2914] has broken ranks they're out of position they're derelict of duty they are AWOL absent without leave there were those that said Jesus is coming
[time=2924] I'm out of here time is short and they stopped working because why plan for the future Jesus is coming and they became idle
[time=2935] and the universe here says to warn them on the one hand gently encourage but on the other hand firmly correct I know of no passage that does it better than Paul's continuing words to the church of Thessal and Ike found in second Thessalonians 3 10 and 11 listen to these words the translation of the NIV is so sharp for even when we were with you we gave you this rule if a man doesn't work he shouldn't eat we hear that there are some among you who are idle this is the part I love
[time=2978] they are not busy they are busy bodies
[time=2984] usually if you have enough time to talk about the other guy's work you don't have enough work of your own correction to those who were in need of compassion was to warn them not to be idle Ben Franklin said sloth another word for
[time=3003] idleness like rust consumes faster than labor
[time=3009] by weariness the second command was to encourage the timid the word timid there is two Greek words put together in
[time=3020] compound the first word is the word for small olas from which we get oligarchy the rule of the few olas small few little and the word suke for spirit our soul from which we get psychology here the word timid means somebody who is little of spirit our little of soul someone who is not only meek but they are lacking to the point of being emotionally weak i remember watching a movie i don't even
[time=3053] know what the movie was but they stormed in and pointed guns and this man said i am a man of france and not afraid of anything and they shot him they pointed at the next man and he said i am a mouse and he bit the little mouse and i'll do anything that you say small of soul in the movie captain blood peter blood says to this
[time=3076] mouse of a man will you do me a favor in the little mousy man says i will try if i can sir and peter blood says find me a stick about this long stiff and sturdy can you do that the man said i can do that he says fine when you do it lash it to your spine and be a man there are many of us who spiritually need to lash something to our spine because we're small of spirit you know what we lash to our spines
[time=3109] each other the word says encourage the timid
[time=3115] the word encourages another compound para around kaleo to call it means to call around have you ever been alone and been discouraged and then someone comes alongside of you and together there is strength here's what Homer said in his ilean we must quiet ourselves like men and strive to aid our cause although we be too great is the strength of feeble arms combined and we can combat even the
[time=3143] brave oh there may be those who are timid today what they need is somebody who is strong to come alongside and lash their lives together the the next imperative help the week the week is no doubt a reference to those who are spiritually weak that is our context use it generically that's fair but here it talks about that individual who is not spiritually strong they're they're not functioning well they are not part of the productive side of the ledger they are a liability on the body of christ and too often we are wanting to limit our liabilities i'm a conservative but sometimes we conservatives do air when it comes to the week i share this definition of a conservative with you a liberal sees a man drowning 50 feet offshore throws them a hundred foot a line and then drops his end to go do another good deed the conservative sees a man drowning 50 feet offshore throws him 25 foot a line and says kick it'll build character
[time=3216] most of us who are conservatives often fail to be gentle and to not only give verbal advice but to literally help the week the fourth imperative be patient i am very good at that command be patient until you add the prepositional phrase with everyone i'm patient with those who are kind
[time=3241] i'm patient with those who are loving i'm patient with those who are cooperative it's the rest of the people that i have struggles with and so do you the word patient here is a word that calls us to be stretched when we think our ropes about broke not patient when you're fresh not patient when they're easy but when you're worn and you're torn from the battle to put up with it again that's the part i'm not so good at the fifth command don't repay evil for evil Robert E. Lee was summons to the president Jefferson Davis's office there he was asked to give his opinion of one of his subordinate generals and lee gave a glowing opinion his aide interrupted him and addressed the general said general that is your man you're subordinate who has criticized you and constantly undermined you and lee said to his aide i know that but the president did not ask that man's
[time=3312] opinion of me he asked my opinion of him and i hold him in high regard
[time=3318] what an opportunity to repay evil for evil and he refused to do so bacon said a man who studies revenge keeps a wound open that would have otherwise healed and done fine the final command be kind Mark Twain had no love for bankers he had made his fortune as a writer
[time=3345] and then lost his fortune as a publisher he felt the banks had done him in so he tells this story at the expense of bankers who i hold in high regard i'm only quoting mark twang a farmer went in and pled for a loan and the banker looked at him and was not ready to give the loan the farmer pleaded and finally the banker says i'll tell you what i've got one glass eye and if you can tell me which of these two eyes is the glass one i'll give you the loan the farmer looked for a moment and he said sir i believe it's the one that has a slight hint of kindness in it made people find in our eyes a kindness here it says a kindness for each other that refers to those of us who are family in christ jesus and then it says kindness to all
[time=3400] let me be a little kinder let me be a little blinder to the faults of those about me let me praise a little more let me be when i am weary just a little bit more cheery let me serve a little better those i'm striving for let me be a little braver when temptation bids me waiver
