[time=90] In the year 110 AD, the emperor Trajan was desperately seeking an explanation for the miraculous spread of this new religion called Christianity.
[time=102] In an exchange of letters between himself and the governor of Bithynia, a man called Plenny, he found the answer.
[time=111] Plenny wrote back to the emperor these words, "I have infiltrated their ranks with spies.
[time=117] Some have even become baptized as Christians.
[time=121] All that I've been able to find is that they meet early in the morning or in the dead of night and worship Christ as God.
[time=130] They share a meal together and read the sacred writings of their faith.
[time=135] Beyond this, all that I can find is that they encourage people to obey the government and to pray for all men.
[time=144] There was a faith that was contagious, a faith that demanded an explanation.
[time=151] (mysterious music)
[time=165] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=171] Rick's message today is entitled, "Three Germs That Make Us Contagious, Part Two."
[time=177] The emperor Trajan desperately sought an explanation for the unexplainable spread of Christianity.
[time=182] Today on the Bible Hour, we will examine what he found.
[time=185] This is our final look at a study which we have called, "Contagious Christianity." In this last message from 1 Thessalonians, Rick will complete the subject entitled, "Three Germs That Make Us Contagious."
[time=197] If you were with us last week, you will remember that the first two germs were cooperation in compassion.
[time=204] Today we will examine the true character of the contagious Christian.
[time=208] By the way, is the emperor desperately seeking an explanation for the impact of your faith on this world?
[time=214] If plenty were writing about this church, about your church, or about you, what would you tell the emperor?
[time=221] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=226] Rick's text is taken from chapter 5 verses 16 through 28.
[time=231] Our special music today will be provided by the sanctuary choir, the king's kids, and Scott Schindler.
[time=241] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry at the Blackbok Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=249] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=253] Now, here's Rick.
[time=256] We want to welcome you this morning to our worship service and also welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=265] We hope that you've come today to find in Jesus Christ one who would care for you and one who is worthy of your worship.
[time=274] You may be a believer in Christ today, then we encourage you to come and to worship with us.
[time=279] You may not have yet come to faith in Christ. You're a seeker.
[time=283] We invite you as well and trust that this hour will have a contagious impact for Christ in your life.
[time=290] We've come today to give majesty and glory to the name of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
[time=298] and our choir sings that hymn for us, the majesty and glory of your name.
[time=328] Christ's eyes, let's see the work of your fingers.
[time=338] [MUSIC - 228 seconds]
[time=573] >> Last week I had the privilege to fellowship with other musicians and choir directors from around the country in Ohio, and the cathedral quartet was there, and when they got finished, one of the fellows who had recently had a heart attack but was back with the group was told he'd never sing again after they sang a rousing song one that was really uplifting the Lord.
[time=602] He said I just feel like shouting glory and he shouted it out and he said but of course I'm too sophisticated to say that word.
[time=610] Sometimes that's the way I feel up here that when we worship the Lord that way with you all singing and the choir singing we just sing Alleluia to God.
[time=618] It's a great source of strength for us as we worship together.
[time=622] Let's continue that by recalling the good things that God has done for us even this week by singing number 66.
[time=628] We'll sing the first and third stanzas together of "To God, be the glory." [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=788] Thank you very much for that good singing. Before us now I mentioned in the first service how much more beautiful the front of the platform was when these young people came up here and covered up these men back here.
[time=803] Boy they are beautiful in spite of the fact that the parents are out there in the auditorium and look how they look but these kids are marvelous.
[time=811] These are the king's kids. They've been working for several months now on a musical entitled "The Bible Tells Me So Show."
[time=819] And for those of you that are in auditorium you should be here tonight at 6 p.m.
[time=824] You'll enjoy a great time with these kids. Make it a point to come back tonight and join us.
[time=829] They're going to give you a sample of some of the great music that you're going to hear tonight and the good smiles and action that you'll see from these kids.
[time=837] They're directed by Jennifer Vaughn and Carol Cobine. They're going to present to you now "The Bible Tells Me So Show."
[time=844] [MUSIC]
[time=871] "The Bible Tells Me So Show." Always a place to be. It's a show that shows you what the art is written to you.
[time=881] It's the name of the man they ask you. Look, it's a hard word. That's your find some promises you may not ever.
[time=891] The Bible Tells Me So Show. Always a place to be. It's a show that shows you what the art does for you and me.
[time=900] It's a word that promises and then you pour it off.
[time=906] The Bible Tells Me So Show. Always a place to be.
[time=927] [APPLAUSE]
[time=935] [MUSIC]
[time=947] Flowers is for me. Flowers is for you. The Bible is a book of promises.
[time=956] Every word is true. It's stories that you read. It's always to be me.
[time=964] And through them that's made promises. And he will always be.
[time=970] It's promises. Every word he's spoken are promises.
[time=979] Remember to be broken through his promises. Take the time to read and kiss promises.
[time=990] Make me new. Some people say you can't believe everything you read.
[time=1000] But if you read and work, don't know. It's true. It's true. Can be.
[time=1010] The Bible says for me. Flowers is for you. The Bible is a book of promises. And we're
[time=1022] it's true. It's always to be. It's always to be me.
[time=1028] And through them that's made promises. And he will always be.
[time=1040] It's promises. Every word he's spoken are promises. And to be broken through his promises.
[time=1048] Take the time to read and kiss promises. Make me new.
[time=1057] It's promises. And he will always be.
[time=1069] [MUSIC]
[time=1075] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1081] Hello again and thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today. It's a beautiful sunny Sunday. A rare treat for us.
[time=1089] It's a gorgeous day outside Rick and I think the Lord has just helped us a little bit and encouraged our worshipers to come and fellowship with us.
[time=1097] Well it's always our responsibility to have the joy of the Lord but he's made it a little bit easier today than usual.
[time=1103] That's right. You're coming back from a music weekend. Tell me a little about what you heard and saw.
[time=1108] Well we were over in Ohio and Worthington, Ohio at the Grace Brethren Church where they conduct annually the Hosanna. This was Hosanna 89.
[time=1115] And that's a time when guest musicians come in to inspire the people and minister to them.
[time=1121] As well as the choral reading sessions and clinics for us to just get some administrative abilities tuned up and some know-how in our methodology.
[time=1132] It was a good time. Who were some of the musicians you heard and enjoyed the most?
[time=1136] Well I think the cathedral's, the cathedral quartet are always great. They just get the audience going.
[time=1143] They're a great synchspiration type group and they're really inspiring. Debbie McClendon was there. She's an outstanding soprano soloist.
[time=1152] The Franklin's were there. Greg Buchanan was there with his harp and I really enjoy his unique style of playing on the harp.
[time=1160] Well that sounds great. I'm looking forward to hearing more of that in the days ahead.
[time=1164] Today is the first Sunday in the month of May as you're watching the Bible Hour.
[time=1169] And with that change of months we have a change of publications to share with you.
[time=1174] During the month of May we will be studying Christianity at the close of the 20th century.
[time=1181] We live in a time here in America of unparalleled prosperity.
[time=1186] Yet the more we have, the more we want. Money has become the very focal issue of life.
[time=1193] It's a rival to God. Yet it's also a resource from God.
[time=1197] How do we balance all of our prosperity with also our responsibilities?
[time=1203] What are the spiritual issues that are confronting us?
[time=1206] The lack of commitment to our families and our churches.
[time=1209] I'm looking forward to studying this theme with you during the month of May.
[time=1213] And to supplement our study we have this booklet to share with you with the simple one word title, Money.
[time=1219] It is not an attempt to get your money. It is an attempt to help you to gain God's perspective on earthly riches.
[time=1228] And then along with this publication we have a very brief pamphlet for you on the fact that it's Mother's Day.
[time=1235] And this little booklet is an excellent booklet.
[time=1238] Peter was just telling me some of the humor he enjoyed out of this.
[time=1241] We'd like to send you both of these to enrich your spiritual life during the month of May.
[time=1247] I hope you'll write for them right now.
[time=1249] You can receive these pamphlets by writing to the Bible Hour.
[time=1253] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1260] Once again, that's the Bible Hour. 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1268] Thank you, Peter.
[time=1270] And before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to encourage you to join us this summer.
[time=1275] On June the 7th for an excellent film called A Man Called Norman.
[time=1280] Many of you have probably heard bits and pieces of his story on Focus on the Family with Dr. James Dobson.
[time=1287] This is a much demanded film and we've been looking forward to airing it here for our church family and for you.
[time=1294] So please set the night of June the 7th aside and plan on being with us here at 7 o'clock for a film titled A Man Called Norman.
[time=1304] Thanks again for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1334] [MUSIC - 175 seconds]
[time=1529] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1539] Thank you, Scott, and we today, glory in the God who is our mighty fortress, our help in ages past and the God who cares about us individually today.
[time=1551] It's my privilege to introduce to you some friends of our ministry here by the name of Dan and Judy Smith.
[time=1558] I believe that Dan and Judy were the first missionaries our church have sponsored and they've been serving the Lord for many years now.
[time=1567] Although they look remarkably young, they've been on the field for probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 years or more.
[time=1574] Dan and Judy, tell us first of all a little bit about your family.
[time=1578] Okay, we have four children, our son Dan is a senior at Baptist Bible College in Clark Summit and on May 12th he'll be graduating.
[time=1586] We also have a daughter at Baptist Bible College in her freshman year, Janice, and this summer she will be working for a while and then also coming back to the field with us for about a month.
[time=1596] They like to get back to Peru every chance they can.
[time=1599] We have a daughter that's a freshman here at home, Baptist High School and another daughter that's in sixth grade.
[time=1606] Those two will be returning with us to the field and I do homeschooling down there for them.
[time=1612] Thank you. Dan, your ministry I know about, but hundreds of these people have not met you before.
[time=1618] When you think of missionaries and all of the jungle stories, they have had them all.
[time=1625] Tell us a little bit about the type of ministry you're in.
[time=1629] It's been our privilege to be River missionaries in the sense that we travel out on the Amazon River and several of its major tributaries,
[time=1637] being the Maranyone in Tigre Rivers and in evangelism, reaching distant towns with a gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1645] and it's been exciting to see over 15 churches established in many of these towns along the way.
[time=1650] And to see two of our river churches launch out in missions of their own starting ten churches.
[time=1656] So that's been a very exciting part of our river and ministry.
[time=1659] We're able to travel as a family on the houseboat taking my wife and my children with us.
[time=1663] And that makes it doubly exciting because my children are able to participate with us and be a part of the ministry.
[time=1669] Now, when we hear the term houseboat, our people think of, you know, luxury ocean liner.
[time=1676] Tell us this size and a little bit about your houseboat.
[time=1680] Our houseboat was built in 1974 in Cherry Hill, New Jersey by a group of men I had known.
[time=1686] And it was exciting to see how God put that thing together and we were able to take it to the Amazon of that same year.
[time=1692] And it's 40 feet long, it's 12 feet wide, that's the overall length.
[time=1696] Now, my wife would say the living space inside, because she's more sensitive to the living, would be about 26 feet long by 9 feet.
[time=1704] So we've been able to raise our children and live in a 26 by 9 area of the boat.
[time=1709] Now, of course, there are three bathrooms in the living room and a family room and each child has their own bedroom.
[time=1715] Oh, sure. We have four bunks in the back and the bathroom is 54 inches by 54 inches.
[time=1721] And I get the wheelhouse, that's the only place I can have, my own.
[time=1726] That is remarkable not only how you live but how effectively God has used you to establish those churches
[time=1734] and that those churches are establishing churches in the heartland of South America.
[time=1739] How can our people best pray for you?
[time=1741] I have been impressed with the importance of prayer.
[time=1745] More, I think this last term of service than any other time in our missionary experience is to see God answer prayer.
[time=1751] Now, I would like to encourage our people to pray for missions, for missionaries, for changed lives, for healthy and safety as we travel on the river
[time=1762] and that God would work in our people's lives, pray for our national pastors and the leadership there.
[time=1768] Some of them are going through some difficult times with changing economics and politics and where we are living.
[time=1776] We're finding that many of our pastors are really counting the cost for serving the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1782] And we'd ask you to pray for them and I know they would be encouraged by that.
[time=1787] We'll certainly do that. Thanks for being partners in ministry with us.
[time=1793] In case you're wondering what this is, it's not to beat on the pastor with but it's a canoe paddle that was made by hand
[time=1800] by one of our pastors along the Amazon who asked me to bring this and share this with the pastor in this church
[time=1807] just to say thank you for praying for the national leaders, for the national pastors along the Amazon
[time=1813] and for the churches that have been established there. So pastor, this is with prayers and thanksgiving.
[time=1819] Well, we are grateful and this will serve as a wonderful reminder for us to be praying for you and my son, no doubt, will have a little bit more fear of God placed in his life.
[time=1830] Thank you so much. Thanks, Judy.
[time=1834] It is such a privilege for us as a church to have men and women around the world who are ambassadors for Jesus Christ.
[time=1851] And what a privilege that because we pray for them or we give to their work, we're partners with them.
[time=1858] We are so thankful for Dan and Judy and the other dozens and dozens of ambassadors for Christ that they represent.
[time=1865] Let's pray together. Father, we've been challenged to hear of how people can float down a river in a nine foot wide home
[time=1875] and be effective for Jesus Christ. I need to ask you to forgive me for the moments, the hours that I have threaded over
[time=1885] needs that were not needs. They were nothing more than wants and unrealistic expectations.
[time=1892] Thank you for teaching us through them what it means to be a pioneer, someone on the front line.
[time=1900] And though we may not be in a houseboat on a river through a jungle, help us to see our world as just as needy of Christ.
[time=1909] Help us to make whatever sacrifices of fortune or fame, of popularity or of money to reach our community, our jungle for Christ.
[time=1921] We would pray that in the time of change as Dan has reflected in politics and government affairs, as there may come hardship on believers
[time=1931] that it would only serve to refine them like gold. And we invite you today to refine us, to stretch us.
[time=1939] And through your word to build us up, to give us a contagious faith in Christ.
[time=1945] As Scott has played this morning, we trust that believers would find in you a refuge, a mighty fortress of protection.
[time=1953] We would pray this morning for Virgil Kelly and Bessie Blakely and Catherine Northrup in their senior years as they battle with
[time=1960] needs of their body that you would give strength to their heart.
[time=1964] May those bodies that grow weak have a spirit that grows stronger day by day.
[time=1970] May your word fill them and keep them.
[time=1973] We would pray today for Linda Archer's family and particularly her stepfathers, he battles cancer that threatens his life.
[time=1981] May he and Linda's mother and other family members know you and know of your love.
[time=1987] We would pray today that you would be a God of all encouragement to Aileen Alotz as she battles with diabetes and various problems.
[time=1995] A loss of leg, a loss of health. May she not know the loss of a spirit. May you refresh her spirit.
[time=2003] We pray today for those who are suffering the deep pain of rejection and loss.
[time=2008] Not to death, not to health, but the people that they love have not responded in love.
[time=2015] We would pray that you would turn the hearts of men towards home.
[time=2018] Give men a desire to invest in their children and in their spouses, not just to invest their dollars, but their lives and their time and their words.
[time=2027] We pray that you would turn the hearts of mothers towards home, whether they work in the home or outside of the home.
[time=2034] May it be a priority to love children and to provide that compassion within the walls of a house.
[time=2042] We'd pray today that you would give us a hunger for righteousness, a walk with Christ that is so contagious, the world is dying to know what makes the difference.
[time=2054] For it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=2059] The year was 110 AD. Trajan was emperor in Rome, and plenty was governor in Bathynia, a land that we now call Turkey.
[time=2072] And Christianity had spread from the east to the western shore of the Roman Empire, and the emperor was caught in contemplation.
[time=2082] And what was it about these Christians that allowed them without sword or dagger to take over his empire?
[time=2091] Between plenty and Trajan letters were exchanged as they tried to figure out the power and the strength of these Christians.
[time=2101] In 110 AD, plenty wrote from Bathynia to Trajan the governor in Rome these words.
[time=2108] After the appropriate remarks about Trajan's position as emperor said, "I have been trying to get the information all that I could regarding these Christians.
[time=2120] I have even hired spies to profess to be Christians and become baptized in order that they might get into the Christian services without suspicion."
[time=2131] Contrary to what I had supposed, I find that these Christians meet in the dead of the night or at early morning, and they sing a hymn to Christ as God.
[time=2144] They read from their sacred writings in partake of a very simple meal, consisting of bread and wine and water.
[time=2153] The water added to dilute the wine in order that there might be enough for all.
[time=2159] This is all that I can find out except that they exhort each other to be subject to the government and to pray for all men.
[time=2169] That early church, those first century Christians were so contagious that they had literally captured the imagination of Rome and of the emperor himself.
[time=2181] They lived a life that absolutely demanded an explanation. They were winsome. They were contagious.
[time=2190] What were the germs that made them so contagious?
[time=2195] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it for our last study in the book of 1 Thessalonians.
[time=2202] We're studying chapter 5 verses 16 through the end of the chapter. We began last week with three germs that make us contagious.
[time=2212] The germ of a cooperative heart and spirit, a compassion for each other.
[time=2217] Now the day in verses 16 to the end of the chapter, we find the character that makes us contagious.
[time=2223] Here's 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 16 in the new international version.
[time=2230] Be joyful. Always. Pray continually. Give thanks in all circumstances for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[time=2244] Do not put out the spirit's fire. Do not treat prophecies with contempt.
[time=2252] Test everything. Hold on to the good. Avoid every kind of evil.
[time=2259] May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through.
[time=2265] May your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless.
[time=2269] At the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.
[time=2276] Brothers pray for us. Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
[time=2281] I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.
[time=2287] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
[time=2292] Here we come across eight commands, eight military imperatives that all focus around the character of a Christian.
[time=2303] A character of life that would make us contagious.
[time=2306] I'd like to group these in three different sections.
[time=2310] The first dimension that makes our character contagious is the discipline of our minds.
[time=2317] Three commands focus on discipline of our mind and our attitude.
[time=2323] They are be joyful always. Pray continually and in everything give thanks.
[time=2332] Look at them closely. The first one is a command that says be joyful always.
[time=2339] Now there is a verse that demands our attention.
[time=2343] Let me tell you first of all what these commands don't mean and then what they do mean.
[time=2347] When it says be joyful always, it doesn't mean that no matter what happens we laugh it off.
[time=2353] You're working on your house, you hit the nail.
[time=2357] Not the six penny nail, the nail on the end of your thumb.
[time=2361] This verse does not say, "That's great. I've been waiting for that to happen. I just love it."
[time=2367] That's not what the verse means.
[time=2369] Be happy about your thumb.
[time=2371] The verse doesn't mean be happy when you get a telephone call that your son is fine.
[time=2377] The new car that you loaned him is not.
[time=2380] Oh, that's not right. I have no problem. We'll laugh it off.
[time=2384] No, it doesn't mean that we are always happy, that we are always laughing, that we always can blow things off as though they don't matter.
[time=2393] Nor does it mean in the popular phraseology of the day, don't worry, be happy.
[time=2399] The philosophy behind that phrase is don't be responsible.
[time=2403] Don't care. Just roll through life.
[time=2407] No, this phrase demands far more than a k-sera-sera attitude.
[time=2412] When it says be joyful always, it's talking about a predisposition of our mental attitude.
[time=2421] Let me begin telling you what it means by distinguishing between joy and happiness.
[time=2427] The word happy has its root, the same word is happening.
[time=2431] And I am happy if I like what is happening.
[time=2435] Happiness then is a reaction to something that is happening, where joy is a predisposition that I hold before anything happens.
[time=2448] Joy is a predisposition of our soul that is before and beyond
[time=2456] any circumstances that come into our lives.
[time=2461] Let me give you this illustration.
[time=2464] Two little boys are twins. They're about six years old.
[time=2467] They walk hand in hand across the beach into the ocean about waist deep.
[time=2472] A big wave comes in, rises up and knocks the two boys down.
[time=2476] The first one jumps up and he's laughing hysterically, and the second one jumps up and he's crying frantically.
[time=2484] The same thing happened to both and one had joy and one had terror.
[time=2492] Why? Because of the predisposition of their attitudes.
[time=2497] One of them may not have been afraid of the water, others may have been.
[time=2501] We don't know why, but it illustrates that we can go through the same experience and come out with a completely different reaction.
[time=2508] And what will determine it is our predisposition.
[time=2513] If you're a gramarian, please note that this phrase is a command.
[time=2518] Imperative mode. In other words, God is not suggesting, "Christian, you'd be a lot happier if you'd be more joyful." Or, "I just had an idea." God says, "Wouldn't it be nice if we all just were a little bit more joyful?" Note God like a sergeant in the military points a finger at you and says, "Be happy. Be joyful. It is a command." And the implication of a command is it is within our potential to obey that command.
[time=2550] Now, if you're like me, you instantly come to this, be joyful and we start with excuses.
[time=2555] Excuse number one, parents.
[time=2558] My mother was like this.
[time=2560] If you had a father like mine, you'd have an attitude like mine.
[time=2564] No doubt our parents shape our outlook and our attitude in life.
[time=2569] But we still have the capacity to choose.
[time=2573] And I know of two good reasons to choose to be different than the negative attitude
[time=2579] that you may have been raised with.
[time=2581] One is for your life and the second is for the life of your children.
[time=2587] If your parents pass it on to you, please don't pass it on to them.
[time=2592] Excuse number two, after we blame it on our parents' to blame it on our personalities, well, I'm just a melancholy, you know.
[time=2600] Well, he's a sanguine and he's always happy.
[time=2603] He's just a duck. He lets it roll off his back.
[time=2606] But I'm different.
[time=2608] You are different. We are all different.
[time=2611] And there's truth to personality types.
[time=2614] But, you know, God didn't say all of you sanguines be happy.
[time=2618] And all of you melancholy make it a challenge for them to be happy.
[time=2624] We can't blame it on our personality types.
[time=2627] The sanguine needs to hear, be joyful.
[time=2630] The melancholy needs to hear, be joyful, be joyful, be joyful every minute of every day.
[time=2637] Because, you see, it's in that attitude, that predisposition of character
[time=2643] that makes our faith in Jesus Christ contagious if we are joyful.
[time=2652] A third point of blame is we blame it on to our past problems.
[time=2656] Well, if you knew what I'd been through, you wouldn't expect me to be joyful.
[time=2660] The man who wrote these words, the Apostle Paul, by inspiration of God, gave us a list of what he had been through.
[time=2668] Here's what he says.
[time=2670] 2 Corinthians chapter 11.
[time=2674] "I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.
[time=2683] Five times I received from the Jews, 39 lashes.
[time=2687] Three times I was beaten with rod.
[time=2689] Once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked.
[time=2692] I spent a day and a night in the open sea.
[time=2695] I've been constantly on the move.
[time=2697] I've been in danger from rivers, in dangers from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles, in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea, in danger from false brothers.
[time=2710] I have labored and toiled, and have gone without sleep.
[time=2715] I have known hunger and thirst, and I've gone without food.
[time=2719] I have been cold and naked.
[time=2721] Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.
[time=2730] I don't know about you, but I haven't been beaten shipwreck or lashed.
[time=2735] And yet this is the man who says, by inspiration of God, be joyful.
[time=2741] Many of us are like the pessimist who was described as a man who was sad when he was glad
[time=2748] for fear that he would feel worse when he was better.
[time=2753] You know, it really is a predisposition of our own mind.
[time=2760] Let me give you very quickly three joy robbers.
[time=2764] The first thing that typically robs us of our joy is unresolved conflicts.
[time=2770] If you've got some conflict between you and a family member, between you and a co-worker, or between you and a brother in Christ, that conflict can rob you of your joy, and the only solution is forgiveness.
[time=2786] A second joy, Robert, is unrestrained appetites.
[time=2792] Many of us are not happy with what we have because we focus on what we don't have.
[time=2798] And we're like JD Rockefeller.
[time=2801] We only want just a little bit more.
[time=2805] And the only solution to find joy is contentment.
[time=2810] And the third joy, Robert, that I often meet is unrealistic expectations.
[time=2816] We expect more out of life.
[time=2818] We expect more out of our spouse.
[time=2820] We expect more out of our church.
[time=2822] We expect more out of our boss.
[time=2824] We expect more out of our employees that is unrealistic.
[time=2827] I remember watching, and I bring this up because there's a movie coming back, The Six Million Dollar Man.
[time=2833] The Six Million Dollar Man hears a bomb ticking in his car.
[time=2837] He jams on the brakes.
[time=2840] He pushes the door open, and the beautiful lady jumps out.
[time=2843] The bomb blows up the car, launching her in the air, head over heels down a hundred foot ravine.
[time=2848] The Six Million Dollar Man jumps up in the air and lands down at the bottom in a single bound.
[time=2853] He picks her up.
[time=2855] After all this, her hair is perfect.
[time=2857] Her makeup is unsmudged, and her outfit is beautiful, and he rescues her.
[time=2862] And America says, "That's really living."
[time=2868] And television shapes our expectations, and we are miserable because we're not real.
[time=2874] And without joy in our life, we lose our contagious character.
[time=2881] There was a rather famous bandit, a generation ago by the name of Arthur Berry.
[time=2888] He made his distinction because he wouldn't rob from you or from me, but only from the rich and the famous.
[time=2894] He had hit hundreds of people and always left his calling card.
[time=2898] Finally, Arthur Berry was caught.
[time=2901] He spent the rest of his years in prison until he was released as an older man.
[time=2906] His release made the news, and a reporter said, "Mr. Berry, of all the rich and famous people you robbed, from whom did you take the most?" And Arthur Berry said, "The man from whom I took the most was Arthur Berry."
[time=2921] He had robbed himself of his life.
[time=2923] And you know you could today be robbing yourself of your joy.
[time=2928] And God says, "Be joyful always."
[time=2934] The second part of this instruction to discipline our minds is the phrase "pray continually."
[time=2942] What that does not mean is that you get on your knees, fold your hands, close your eyes, bow your head, and pray 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
[time=2953] Obviously, you can't do that.
[time=2956] What then does it mean?
[time=2959] Well, I believe it may mean at least these two things.
[time=2963] One, to be consistent in prayer, and two, to have communion with God at every moment.
[time=2971] D.O. Moody was not prone to subtlety, and he was not fond of those who in his church services prayed too long.
[time=2980] And so if somebody was at the microphone praying and Moody had heard enough of his prayer and he was still going on, Moody had just come up to the side and say to the music minister, "Brother Sankey, come lead us all into him while this brother finishes his prayer."
[time=2996] Well, I don't think we need to be quite that abrupt, but the point of this is that prayer is not measured in its length,
[time=3006] but in its depth.
[time=3009] I did a medical internship a year ago and went back to the reunion this year, and the doctor was passing out diplomas and he said, "Rick, here's your diploma.
[time=3017] You're now to free to practice medicine.
[time=3020] Only one kind.
[time=3021] You can practice anesthesiology and put people to sleep on Sunday morning whenever you would like." Well, I hope that neither my praying nor my preaching has the effect of an anesthesiologist on you, but the point of this verse is that our prayer life is alive, that it's dynamic, that is a part of every fabric of our being.
[time=3044] You know, you spend every moment of every day in constant thought.
[time=3050] I would say we could give each other a penny for our thoughts, but that just shows the markup of inflation these days.
[time=3057] But with all of our thinking, are we conscious that God says, "I'm part of this conversation?
[time=3064] I want to talk with you, not just in the formal church services, not around the dinner table, but as you walk, as you talk, as you drive, I am there, I'm with you.
[time=3075] Have a consistency to your prayer and have a common prayer life with God at all times." Lightfoot said, "It is not the moving of the lips, but in the elevation of the heart that the essence of prayer is found." Billy Graham said, "Prayer is more than verbally filling out a few requisition forms.
[time=3097] It is fellowship with God." You see, our lives will have a contagious character if they're not only joyful, but they're lived in constant communion, constant conversation with God.
[time=3112] The third command that talks about our discipline of our minds is this one.
[time=3119] Give thanks in all circumstances.
[time=3123] Let me tell you what this one does not mean.
[time=3126] It does not say give thanks for all circumstances.
[time=3131] There's a world of difference between the word "in" and the word "for." God does not command us, nor do I believe expect us to be thankful for the death of a loved one, for a disease that cripples our body, for an accident that robs us of our mobility, for a boss that's a tyrant, for a husband who is worse.
[time=3155] But he expects us in every circumstance to find something in that circumstance for which we can give thanks.
[time=3164] Last week, I went to visit Bessie Blakely.
[time=3167] Bessie's 91 years old, a sweet saint that God has blessed this church with.
[time=3173] She had a massive stroke.
[time=3175] It was unlikely that she would ever live, let alone talk.
[time=3180] I had visited her often, had it others, and never saw her talk.
[time=3185] Others had said she had spoken a few words.
[time=3189] 91, in a hospital, unable to move half of her body.
[time=3194] I walked in and I bent over and I said, "Bessie, it's Rick from church." She opened up her eyes, looked at me and said, "The Lord is the biggest part of my life
[time=3207] and went back to sleep." If you could only speak for a moment.
[time=3212] Out of a hospital bed, ravaged by a stroke, what would your single statement be?
[time=3219] Let me tell you about a new friend by the name of Dave.
[time=3222] Dave is a quadriplegic.
[time=3224] Nothing moves from the chin down, including his lungs.
[time=3229] He has to be supported by a machine that stimulates his diaphragm and breathes for him through a tracheotomy.
[time=3236] Dave gave his heart to Jesus Christ about a year ago as I was visiting Dave last week.
[time=3244] He told me how thankful he was for the love and support of his family, how thankful he was for modern technology.
[time=3251] He's about to graduate from IU with a degree in finance that he takes on a computer that he moves with his mouth.
[time=3258] He told me how thankful he was for televisions and VCRs and classes that could be taught,
[time=3264] technology that allows him to breathe.
[time=3266] He must have given thanks in that situation for a dozen things, and he never complained once.
[time=3275] I don't think God expects Dave to be thankful for his circumstances, but Dave has learned to be thankful in his circumstances, and he is a contagious Christian because he has learned to discipline his attitude.
[time=3292] If you're not convinced by me saying all these, please don't be.
[time=3296] Notice the next phrase, and this is God's will for you.
[time=3301] A great grammatical debate is that just the third imperative or the three that preceded, I'm of the opinion that this is God's will, that you be joyful always, that you be prayerful continually, and that in everything you give thanks, wouldn't you want to do God's will?
[time=3318] Many of us have spent hours trying to discover it, and God says if you'll be joyful and prayerful and thankful, I'm not nearly as concerned where you are is what you are, and that's my will.
[time=3331] The next series of commands focus about the discernment of our spirit.
[time=3336] There are three commands here.
[time=3338] Command number one is this, don't quench the spirit or in the new international version, do not put the spirits fire out.
[time=3349] In both old and New Testament, the Holy Spirit is called a fire because he lights up our life.
[time=3356] It's not Michelobe, it's Jesus Christ who will light up your life.
[time=3361] And the Holy Spirit comes in and he indwells us, he enlighten us, he guides us, he directs us,
[time=3369] he gives us instincts from God himself, and we have the opportunity to either fan the flame or to quench the flame.
[time=3379] Literally the word quench means to be extinguished metaphorically here, it is used to say to snuff or to stifle, to suppress our delimit.
[time=3391] And God's Holy Spirit will work in our lives and he will allow our lives to be contagious
[time=3398] if we do not suppress his work.
[time=3401] The next commands is don't hold prophecy in contempt.
[time=3405] These Christians did not have the New Testament because they were the first to receive any of it.
[time=3412] First Thessalonians is one of the three oldest of 27 books of the New Testament.
[time=3418] And so in those days, because they did not have the completed prophetic message, God gave them prophets who gave them temporary messages.
[time=3427] And prophets gave God's Word until the New Testament was complete.
[time=3433] Then in the book of Revelation it tells us this is the last book about the last things and these are the last prophets and the last prophecy.
[time=3440] There are no prophets today because the New Testament is complete.
[time=3445] But these people were to listen to prophets.
[time=3448] Just as you and I must listen to God's Word, the teaching and preaching out of God's Word.
[time=3453] But the third imperative there says that we are to test everything.
[time=3458] Just because someone says I've got the Spirit of God and I'm a prophet doesn't mean you believe they've got the Spirit and you believe that they are a prophet.
[time=3466] You are to test them and to examine them to see if they are true.
[time=3478] [MUSIC]
[time=3500] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir, the Kings kids and organist Scott Schindler.
[time=3507] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3510] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3515] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3518] Bow and pray with me, will you?
[time=3521] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm grateful that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3528] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3532] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come in today.
[time=3536] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3540] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3545] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Your Decision" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3552] To receive a copy of your decision, or the booklets mentioned earlier entitled "Money" and "A Good Mom Never Tails", please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
