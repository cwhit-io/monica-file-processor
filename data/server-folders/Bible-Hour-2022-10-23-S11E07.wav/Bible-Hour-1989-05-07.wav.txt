[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Christianity has become a casual relationship, one based upon convenience and personal desire.
[time=89] Our convictions are slowly eroding away, and our commitment to following Christ is solely based upon my own comfort.
[time=98] Because of these issues, Francis Shafer was right when he described the fact that we are now entering into the post-Christian era.
[time=119] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. Thank you for joining us.
[time=127] Rick's message today is entitled Christianity at the Close of the 20th Century.
[time=132] There is something frightening about the words "post-Christian era." Europe's cathedrals and great churches are only museums reflecting the past.
[time=141] Her people are skeptical even cynical regarding spiritual things. America is quickly following in the same path.
[time=149] Our commitment has grown casual. Prayer meeting attendance, down, personal Bible reading, down, morality among professing Christians, down.
[time=160] Today and for the next three weeks, we will investigate Christianity at the end of the 20th Century on the Bible Hour.
[time=168] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation Chapter 3, Verses 14 through 22.
[time=177] Our special music today will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra, Keith and Star Brodygum, and Kevin Rowe.
[time=190] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=198] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=203] Now, here's Rick.
[time=205] Thank you for coming. Also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=211] We've come to praise, to worship, to magnify the name of our Lord.
[time=216] That's the very purpose for which He's created us.
[time=219] He has created us to know Him, to worship Him, and to praise Him.
[time=223] How fitting it is that we set this morning in this hour aside to do simply that, to praise Him.
[time=230] It's our privilege of listening to our choirs. They sing a medley of praise hymns that begin with how majestic is your name.
[time=254] Lord, may we know you can worship and battle for you.
[time=265] Lord, if I die, may it all be your name.
[time=300] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=687] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=689] We continue in music now.
[time=691] It's Keith and Star.
[time=692] Ronigan, come to sing for us.
[time=693] Let's listen to the message that they have in song.
[time=696] [MUSIC][MUSIC] Lord Jesus, we worship you.
[time=715] We honor you.
[time=718] We magnify your great.
[time=723] And mighty name.
[time=729] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=904] Lord Jesus, we worship you.
[time=911] We honor you.
[time=916] We magnify your great.
[time=921] And mighty name.
[time=928] Lord Jesus, we join the bloodwash,
[time=935] healings now, we'll pray to end your world.
[time=940] To fall proclaim.
[time=948] Holy Lamb of God, our King and Shepherd,
[time=955] everlasting Lord, for you are worthy to be worshiped.
[time=966] You are worthy to be worshiped.
[time=995] [MUSIC]
[time=1000] Hello again, and we are so thankful you've joined us today here for the Bible Hour.
[time=1006] People are going to think this is a rerun of last week, but how did you like the cathedrals last night?
[time=1011] That's amazing.
[time=1012] I really didn't anticipate hearing them two weeks in a row, but with our new Colosseum edition here and the Gaither Trio coming in the quartet and the cathedral.
[time=1025] They were all there, and it was a great night, it really was.
[time=1028] It really was, and what a thrill it is to hear George John sing again.
[time=1032] Yeah, it's amazing.
[time=1034] Lord has given back his voice, and he just as pry as ever, and really is thankful to the Lord for allowing him to continue to minister in that way.
[time=1044] Well, we certainly had a delightful time here in Fort Wayne with the wonderful musicians here, and that gives me opportunity to say thanks to you for the fine ministry of music we have here at Blackhawk every week.
[time=1055] Well, Rick, that's kind of you, and I want to just pass that on to our musicians because they really are dedicated people, and they work hard, love the Lord, and I think they genuinely want to use their talents for the Lord.
[time=1067] Well, we really appreciate it, and my family is richly blessed by it all.
[time=1071] Good.
[time=1072] We have some special events coming up in the future that we want to include you in.
[time=1077] So, allow us just these brief moments to invite you to the Summer Bible Conference and the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1083] Two events that I want to draw your attention to for the Summer Bible Conference are a film titled "A Man Called Norman." We'll air that here on Wednesday night.
[time=1094] I had to think for a moment.
[time=1095] I almost said Sunday.
[time=1096] On Wednesday, June the 7th, at 7 o'clock.
[time=1099] That's a film that Dr. James Dobson has highly publicized on Hinnis Ministry focus on the family.
[time=1106] And then on June the 28th, we'll have, coming from Peoria, Illinois, in the Grace Presbyterian Church, Bruce Dunn, a fine, godly speaker who has preached God's Word effectively and faithfully for a number of decades now.
[time=1121] He is not a young man, but he is young in heart and spirit, and we had a delightful conversation this week.
[time=1127] We're looking forward to him coming.
[time=1129] He's looking forward to being here on June the 28th.
[time=1132] So save Wednesdays to be a part of the Summer Bible Conference.
[time=1137] And then the first weekend in July is the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1140] Rick, we're looking forward to the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1143] Again, it's always a good time to remember our country and the faithfulness of our God.
[time=1148] We're titling our program this year, "Look Up America." And Rick, that'll be on Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock, July 2nd.
[time=1156] Special guests will be the Sounds Alive.
[time=1159] We recall we established the Sounds Alive in 1977, and they haven't been together now for about 11 years, but they're coming from Alaska, California, Michigan, Texas, and Indiana, coming together to be our special guest that day.
[time=1173] Well, they had a great ministry when they were here the first time, and I'm sure it'll be the same on this weekend.
[time=1179] We do want to encourage you to plan on being here as we have a godly tribute to our rich heritage here in America on July the 2nd for the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1189] Before we return to the live part of today's broadcast in our morning worship service, we have two booklets to share with you.
[time=1197] This first one is entitled, "A Good Mom Never Yells and Other Myths."
[time=1203] This is Mother's Day, and we wanted to share with you this booklet to share with your mother, or perhaps the lady next door who you see raising some little ones.
[time=1213] It's very difficult to live up to everyone's expectations, and there are a lot of myths about motherhood.
[time=1220] This booklet will give refreshment to many a mother, and we'd like to give you a copy if you would simply write to us.
[time=1227] And then also, we have this to share with you, a pamphlet with the simple title of money.
[time=1232] We're bringing that to your attention, because during this month of May, we're looking at the topic Christianity at the close of the 20th century,
[time=1242] and one of the issues that is facing this generation is a fluence.
[time=1247] A fluence to many of us is a dear friend, but many of us don't realize that it's also a very subtle adversary.
[time=1255] A fluence can blind us to our spiritual needs.
[time=1260] Many people say, "I must be doing things right spiritually.
[time=1264] Look how richly I've been blessed." And that's a dangerous trap, and we'd like to send you this booklet to help you balance this precarious issue in your Christian life.
[time=1274] If you'd like these booklets, you may write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1285] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1294] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible hour.
[time=1300] [MUSIC] Feel the time [MUSIC] Seems like there never is enough [MUSIC] There's too much time [MUSIC]
[time=1331] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=1347] â™ª The wind blows, listen. What does it mean? Is it cold like a nightmare or warm as a dream?
[time=1370] Time, time, time and again, time and again.
[time=1378] You're caught in a moment of your life that doesn't seem to change.
[time=1386] And you, your eyes show the pain.
[time=1396] You're caught in a moment of your life that doesn't seem to change.
[time=1403] Let go.
[time=1408] You gotta let go.
[time=1412] And let the Lord of all the ages be the Lord of your soul.
[time=1425] Pray to your Father, He knows the reason why.
[time=1433] Trust in your Master, He will answer your cry.
[time=1445] All time, time will end.
[time=1454] And when it does, you will rest forever in your Father's hands.
[time=1473] Feel the time, feel the time go by.
[time=1477] The time is His and that is why.
[time=1482] Feel the time, feel the time go by.
[time=1498] Thank you, Kevin, and would you bow as we thank the Lord for the precious gift of time.
[time=1505] God, we are thankful for time, for moments that we can spend with our children,
[time=1511] for those precious fleeting hours we can spend with our aging parents.
[time=1516] Thank you for time together, fellowshipping, worshiping you.
[time=1521] We would pray that today you would teach us from your word the value of these days and the time that we have.
[time=1528] As you've instructed us, we want to redeem the time to use it wisely for our growth and your glory.
[time=1536] We thank you for a reminder and song that our hope is in Jesus Christ and that there will come a time when we will inherit eternity.
[time=1545] We pray that that would be of great comfort to Virginia Kelly and Dick Kelly,
[time=1551] as Virgil has stepped from this world into eternity.
[time=1555] We ask you to comfort Virginia in the loss of her husband, Dick in the loss of his father.
[time=1561] We ask you to give that sense of eternal hope to anyone today
[time=1567] who is reflecting upon the loss of a loved one.
[time=1571] We would pray that you would give time and comfort to those who are battling enemies
[time=1578] that attack their health like cancer.
[time=1581] We pray for Ralph Myers and Hardine Marker and others who are battling cancer.
[time=1588] Rex, where is he battles for his life and health?
[time=1593] We would pray this morning that we would be grateful when you've answered prayers and thank you for a little Brandon Burkholder who is healthy and Julie who is strong.
[time=1605] What you've brought them through has been hard this past year, but you've answered prayer and were thankful.
[time=1611] We rejoice that Betty Schindler is getting better.
[time=1614] You've answered prayer and we are grateful.
[time=1617] And we would today ask as we study your word that you would minister to us to make this more than an hour of passive observation but that your spirit would work and energize our lives.
[time=1630] For it's in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1635] Francis Schafer was one of the truly profound and original Christian thinkers
[time=1642] of our generation.
[time=1644] He died just a number of years ago.
[time=1647] One of the statements that he made that had the greatest impact upon my life was when he looked at the continent of Europe and said Europe is now in its post-Christian era.
[time=1661] Well, if you're not given to philosophical conversation, you might wonder what does it mean that something is in its post-Christian era.
[time=1670] By that Schafer was describing that the continent of Europe was significantly shaped in its perspective by Christianity.
[time=1679] However, that era had now ended and was passed.
[time=1684] And separate forces apart from Christianity were now dominating the European theater.
[time=1692] As alarming as that statement is the realization that we in the United States are battling against that momentous tide as well.
[time=1701] We are on the verge on the eve of entering into our post-Christian era.
[time=1707] If you were to take a tour of Europe today or of America in the near future, a tour in America not too long from now might go like this.
[time=1717] Some see this goal. This is called Fort Wayne.
[time=1721] This is one of the three forts that the early settlers of this town built.
[time=1726] They built that to protect themselves from the Indians that were against them and from against the British during the Revolutionary War days.
[time=1734] Come on over here, son. See this home? This is the Sweeney homestead.
[time=1738] This is one of the founding families of Fort Wayne. This is their house.
[time=1742] See that son? That's a church. A generation or two ago people used to come.
[time=1747] I think it was on Sunday morning and they would sing and do stuff in a church and son, we've kept this one open as a museum. And son, here's an art museum.
[time=1759] We're on the verge of Christianity entering into an age when it is only a discussion of history.
[time=1768] We are on the verge of our post-Christian era.
[time=1773] And the single greatest reason for that is a lack of commitment in the lives of those of us who name the name of Christ as Lord.
[time=1785] We had the privilege of going to the Bill Gaither concert last night and I saw most of you there.
[time=1792] I remember some of the stories he told last night.
[time=1795] I had heard them before about the man who walked into a large company, looked at all the people around and he said to one of the supervisors, "How many people work in this company?" The supervisor said about half of them.
[time=1809] He said to one man, "How long have you been working here for this company?" Ever since they threatened to fire me.
[time=1817] In many ways that becomes representative of the dilemma of commitment
[time=1823] in life in general but particularly within what we call a church.
[time=1828] There's a story told, I love it about the animals on Old McDonald's farm asking who was really committed.
[time=1836] And each animal spoke up about how committed they were to serving Old McDonald and finally it came down to the pig and the chicken were arguing over who was the most committed at the breakfast table.
[time=1847] And the pig said, "Well when Old McDonald sits down for ham and eggs you may be involved but buddy I'm committed." And just because we come to a place we say we're involved that doesn't mean that we are committed.
[time=1863] If you have a Bible I encourage you to open it to Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14, while you're finding it, allow me to give you a very quick survey of the first few chapters of Revelation.
[time=1877] When you hear the book Revelation, if you've got any Bible background at all you've got this picture of four horsemen, a pale horse and a grey horse and a white horse
[time=1888] and a red horse and death and plagues and disease and you've got the antichrist swooping out and the beast from the sea and the beast from the land, all of Armageddon and boy it's some book.
[time=1901] Prophecy and you're right.
[time=1904] But the prophetic part of the book largely does not start until chapter 4.
[time=1911] In chapters 2 and 3 there are seven little letters,
[time=1917] the seven different churches in an area of the world then called Asia Minor, it's now what we call Turkey.
[time=1925] It's like Ephesus and Smyrna and Phyotira and Laodicea, Philadelphia.
[time=1931] In those seven churches there are two interpretations.
[time=1935] Interpretation number one is that these churches are all historical churches and what was written to them was applied to them directly and only historically.
[time=1948] That is probably true.
[time=1950] But there's a second interpretation of the letters to these seven churches.
[time=1954] This interpretation says yes, they're historical and it embraces that, but it says they're not only historical, they're prophetic.
[time=1962] That each of the seven churches represents an ascending era in church history.
[time=1969] So the first church in chapter 2 verse 1, Ephesus refers to the first era in church history,
[time=1975] that of the apostles and what we call the post apostolic fathers.
[time=1980] Something around the establishing of the church in, let's say, 35 AD to roughly 100 AD.
[time=1988] Then the second church that is listed there, Smyrna, represents not only that historical church, but then a second era in church history and era of persecution during the days of Domitian and Diocletian.
[time=2001] It will roughly 100 AD to 300 AD.
[time=2005] The third church then represents a third era in church history.
[time=2009] The time when Christianity was no longer Religio Elissata, an illegal religion,
[time=2015] persecuted, but now Religio Elissata, a legal religion.
[time=2020] And it was a day of openness and prosperity.
[time=2024] And so as you move through the seven churches, you're actually moving through history.
[time=2029] And the last church, the Church of Laodicea, according to this theorem, is the Church of the End Times.
[time=2037] I find that a fascinating study of the book of Revelation that even the historical section
[time=2043] may indeed be prophetic.
[time=2045] Whether we take Laodicea's letter to be historical or historical and prophetic,
[time=2052] it is a message that fits our church, the American church at the close of the 20th century.
[time=2062] The American church in Fort Wayne called Blackhawk.
[time=2066] It describes it so well.
[time=2069] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14.
[time=2071] Do you have a Bible?
[time=2073] Look at your text while I read mine.
[time=2076] Revelation 3, 14.
[time=2078] To the angel of the church in Laodicea, right.
[time=2085] These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness.
[time=2089] The ruler of God's creation.
[time=2092] I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot.
[time=2099] I wish you were either one or the other.
[time=2102] So because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
[time=2111] You say, I am rich.
[time=2114] I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.
[time=2119] But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
[time=2127] I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so you can become rich.
[time=2136] And white clothes to wear so you can cover the shameful nakedness and salve to put on your eyes so you can see.
[time=2148] Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline.
[time=2152] So be earnest and repent.
[time=2154] Here I am.
[time=2156] I stand at the door and knock.
[time=2158] If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him and he with me.
[time=2164] To him who overcomes, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne.
[time=2170] Just as I overcame and sat down with my father on his throne.
[time=2176] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[time=2184] As I look at this passage in many ways, I see it as a medical examination, not quite an autopsy.
[time=2192] The patient is still alive, but dangerously close, condition critical.
[time=2201] With that medical model, let me suggest that in verses 14 and 15 were first of all introduced to the doctor who is called into this case.
[time=2211] He is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ, who is called the I Am, the exact one.
[time=2218] When we say amen at the end of our prayer, that is not our cue to let everybody else know we're done eating and it's time to eat.
[time=2225] Amen is a word that means so be it, are definitely our firm.
[time=2231] And when Jesus is called the Amen, it's saying he is it.
[time=2235] He is the one.
[time=2237] And he is faithful.
[time=2239] And he is true as a witness.
[time=2241] So his diagnosis of the church is trustworthy.
[time=2246] It is reliable.
[time=2247] His character is impeccable.
[time=2249] His diagnosis is inescapable.
[time=2253] He is the ruler overall.
[time=2256] And he is about to make his diagnosis.
[time=2259] He says, I know your deeds.
[time=2263] I know your deeds.
[time=2266] Please notice that as Jesus Christ is about to examine his churches and this church, it is going to be an examination of our deeds, not our speech.
[time=2280] He is going to examine our fruit and our character and our conduct, not our confession or our profession of faith.
[time=2290] Christianity has a very, very precarious balance between what we say and what we do.
[time=2300] A living tension between our works and our faith.
[time=2306] There are those who get out of balance in this way and they put the emphasis on our deeds, our works, to the point where their theology and how they actually believe says, you will be saved.
[time=2319] God will allow you to enter heaven if you've got the right credentials.
[time=2324] If you go to church, if you're a member of church, in churches that teach that, usually teach you have to be a member of their church.
[time=2331] If you give money to church, this church, if you serve in the church, if you've been baptized, taken the sacraments, received the blessing of this church, then you have a chance of going to heaven based upon who you are, what you've done, and your deeds.
[time=2348] And that is an out-and-out deception and distortion of Scripture because the Bible says we are saved by faith and by faith alone, not by good deeds, not by any religious experience, any religious background, being a member of any church, being a member of Black Hawk Baptist Church, cannot do anything to save you.
[time=2371] It cannot do anything to give you a place in heaven. If we open up that elaborate baptismals and we fill it with water and we baptize you, whether we sprinkle you, our poor water on you, our dip you once or dip you three times forward or backwards, no sin is washed away.
[time=2388] That cannot save you. It's by faith alone in Jesus Christ.
[time=2395] But there's another heir. It's an heir to which you and I are far more prone. It's the heir of emphasizing faith to the absolute neglect of character in the Christian life.
[time=2406] It is to teach that you are saved by faith and faith alone and stop. It is true that we're saved by faith and faith alone, but the very verse that teaches that the most clearly is Ephesians 2, 8, and 9.
[time=2422] It says, "For by grace are you saved through faith. It is the gift of God. It is not of work so that no one can boast." But verse 10 follows and says, "For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works."
[time=2440] You see, the moment we give our heart to Christ and we receive Him by faith, we're now in a position to live Godly to serve Christ and He has saved us with a very purpose of performing Godly character and deeds.
[time=2455] And when Jesus stands in judgment, He is going to not say, "Did you pray this prayer on the back of the track? Did you ever throw a stick on a fire when you were at camp? Did you ever say, "Now I lay me down to sleep or pray the Lord of the soul to keep Jesus coming to my heart and keep the devil away, amen?"
[time=2474] He's not going to examine what we say we have done or believe or profess. He's going to look at our deeds. He's going to examine our lives and let them speak for us.
[time=2488] The first year I worked at a Christian camp, it was called Camp Carl. And I really was impressed with myself because at the end of the first week, I had a cabin of third graders and nearly every one of them accepted Christ as their Savior.
[time=2503] I said, "Diel Moody, move over." I was disheartened the next year when all of those same boys came back to camp and at the end of that week of camp with a different counselor, they accepted Jesus Christ into their heart.
[time=2519] I worked at that camp for five summers and for five summers, the same kids on Friday night picked up a stick, walked up to the fire and say, "I give my heart to Jesus."
[time=2531] I'm not doubting that some of them meant that sincerely and I don't mean to say that you didn't come to Christ when you were a third grader at Camp Carl, but I do want to ask the question, "Is it only a matter of saying Jesus coming to my heart and throwing a stick on the fire?"
[time=2550] Is that all salvation is? Is that all it means to be a disciple of Christ? This passage says no. He's going to examine our lives. He's going to examine our deeds.
[time=2565] And now the doctor gives his diagnosis. Two conditions. The first condition he says is they are indifferent to Christ.
[time=2576] Verse 15, "I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot. You're neither cold and indifferent and callous, perhaps even hostile to Christ.
[time=2590] You're not hot. You're not vibrant and radical and alive. You are lukewarm."
[time=2600] Most of us, if we weren't familiar with this passage, would find that very complimentary. We'd say, "That's where I want to be. I want to be in the middle. I don't want to be extreme. I don't like non-Christians who deny Christ.
[time=2613] But you know, I'm uncomfortable about these radical Christians who just get a little too zealous. I like being lukewarm." Notice the phrase that follows.
[time=2623] "I wish that you were one or the other, but because you are lukewarm, neither hot or cold, I will spit you out of my mouth."
[time=2634] That phrase had to be spoken with the greatest understanding because Laodicea was located upstream in a valley from Ephesus on one side of a hill.
[time=2649] Across the stream, they could see another community, Ariopolis. Ariopolis was famous for its hot springs of mineral water that would literally percolate out of the ground
[time=2662] and come down over the mountainside, bleaching it with its sulfur, and running into the cold stream.
[time=2670] However, when you bent down and you brought water to your lips, it was no longer a cold stream because the cold waters of the river had merged with the hot waters of the stream.
[time=2683] And now it was a tepid, lukewarm mineral water that would be literally nauseating to even the thirstiest of men.
[time=2695] Perhaps you've had the experience of being thirsty out in the country and you find an old well and you pump it until all the rust is pumped out.
[time=2705] And then you say there, it looks clean and suddenly you have a new aroma of rotten eggs of that putrefrying water.
[time=2715] And no matter how thirsty you are, if you can get past the smell, you can't get past the taste.
[time=2722] And Jesus looks at us and he says, "You're lukewarm, and even if I could get past the smell, I can't get past the taste.
[time=2731] I put you to my mouth and I spit you out.
[time=2735] You're nauseating.
[time=2737] You're indifferent.
[time=2739] You're not cold.
[time=2741] You're not hot.
[time=2743] You're lukewarm.
[time=2745] And I will reject you out of my mouth." To the one who is so impressed with their deeds, we need to be careful that our deeds are not deceptive.
[time=2757] Jesus said this in Matthew 7, 21, they said, "I've cast out demons.
[time=2762] I've healed.
[time=2763] I've taught Sunday school on and on in your name." And Jesus said to them, "I never knew you." All of your deeds were deceptive.
[time=2773] But the Lord also says to those who say, "I accepted Jesus as my Savior 30 years ago."
[time=2780] That your faith may be fictitious.
[time=2784] For in James chapter 2, it says, "Just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead."
[time=2798] And our faith has to be, first of all, receiving Christ as Savior and then secondly, a life that's following Him as Lord.
[time=2811] Because if the deeds aren't there, just maybe, the faith is not there either.
[time=2819] The diagnosis of these people were, first of all, they were spiritually indifferent to Christ.
[time=2825] Secondly, they were not only indifferent, but they were insensitive to their own condition.
[time=2831] Look at verse 17.
[time=2833] You say, "I am rich.
[time=2835] I've acquired wealth, and I have needed nothing." These people looked at their lives and said, "Things are great here.
[time=2842] I'm financially prospering.
[time=2845] I've materially accumulated a lot.
[time=2848] I don't need anything." One of the greatest tragedies of my life in yours is our affluence.
[time=2857] Because affluency is an enemy of faith.
[time=2861] It doesn't mean you can't be affluent and be a Christian.
[time=2864] I believe I'm both, but you need to know it's not your ally.
[time=2868] It's your enemy.
[time=2870] Let me give you several reasons why I say that.
[time=2873] First of all, affluence teaches us to trust in ourselves and not to trust in God.
[time=2882] You see, with our financial power, we can change our lives and we begin to think that's all we need.
[time=2891] Kathy told me of watching the Opal Winfrey Show when Bill Cosby was on there.
[time=2896] Opal said, "Although I've made millions, it really hasn't changed my life." Cosby looked at her and said, "You lie.
[time=2903] It's changed your life in every way." Cosby told about how when he was little and they were poor, his mother was very, very sick and they couldn't afford a doctor, so she just laid their sick.
[time=2914] He said, "Now when my mother's sick, she has every expert in America taking care of her because I've got the financial power to do that." What happens in our lives is we see that our money can change our home.
[time=2927] It can change where we live.
[time=2929] It can change what kind of car we drive, what kind of clothing we wear.
[time=2932] It can change what type of education our kids will have in college.
[time=2935] It can change our opportunities.
[time=2937] It can change government.
[time=2938] It can change churches.
[time=2939] It can change people.
[time=2940] And we've got money.
[time=2941] We've got poem.
[time=2942] We say, "I don't need anything." David Burnham was asked when he was doing a crusade in South Africa.
[time=2949] Dr. Burnham, if Christianity is so true, why do so few wealthy?
[time=2954] And so few intelligent people give their lives to Christ.
[time=2957] And he said instinctively, "Because the more that a man earns, and the more that a man learns,
[time=2963] the easier it is for him to trust him himself and fail to see his need for God."
[time=2969] But affluences an enemy even if we are Christians, because it robs us of our basic commitment in life.
[time=2979] You see, what happens to most of us is we have so many possessions, so many toys that it takes
[time=2985] all of our time to maintain our possessions and our toys.
[time=2989] And some of the most miserable friends I have are the wealthiest people because their lives have no spiritual root, because they have to go on this trip and they have to spend this place.
[time=2998] They have to go here.
[time=2999] They have to do that because they have the money to do it.
[time=3002] And suddenly their lives have no root.
[time=3004] It has no depth because their affluence has robbed them of a consistency in their Christian life.
[time=3014] Finally, it gives us a false sense of values.
[time=3018] My father always taught me two things about money.
[time=3022] I can remember him saying it often. Money can't buy everything, but it can buy most things.
[time=3032] And money is not everything, but it's sure ahead of whatever is in second place.
[time=3037] And you see what happens is because we are so affluent, we can find temporary happiness in a new car,
[time=3045] temporary happiness in a new dress, temporary happiness on another trip, temporary happiness in a bigger house, temporary happiness in a remodeling, temporary happiness in a redecorating.
[time=3057] And we say, "See, I am happy." Billy Graham was sharing with a group of wealthy people that true happiness and true peace is only in Jesus Christ
[time=3067] and one attractive known for her immorality and affluence.
[time=3072] This young lady said, "Well, Billy, what about those of us who are already perfectly happy?"
[time=3079] You see, affluence blinds us and it substitutes real peace and real joy for a temporary thrill.
[time=3088] These people were hooked. They had it all.
[time=3093] They were insensitive to their spiritual condition.
[time=3096] Here's how God said they were. He said, "You're spiritually bankrupt.
[time=3100] You are miserable, wretched, pitiful, and poor.
[time=3104] You are spiritually bankrupt. You are spiritually blind." They didn't see their spiritual condition. They said, "We had it all." It was like the nation of Israel. Jesus said, "Come to me and I'll set you free." And they said, "Free, we've never been slaves to any man." But they had been slaves all their history.
[time=3123] For 400 years they were in slavery in Egypt till the Exodus.
[time=3127] In 586 Nebuchadnezzar, it destroyed their city and their temple, took them in slavery to Babylon.
[time=3133] Every 23 Alexander swept across the land, took them in slavery again, and Tychus saw a pig in the holy of holies of their temple.
[time=3141] In the very moment they said, "We've never been in slaves." There were Roman footbeats pounding against the ground, coming to take them into slavery.
[time=3150] But they were blind to it all.
[time=3154] This church was blind to their spiritual poverty.
[time=3157] Not only were they spiritually bankrupt and spiritually blind, they were spiritually barren.
[time=3162] They stood naked and exposed before God.
[time=3165] They didn't have anything because they didn't have Jesus, the one and the only one who can clothe us.
[time=3174] There's some good news.
[time=3176] That diagnosis and difference to Christ and insensitive to their spiritual condition is followed by a remedy.
[time=3183] Here's the prescription for steps.
[time=3186] Step number one is they had to recognize their spiritual condition.
[time=3190] He said, "I counsel you to buy from me gold, refined in the fire." Now to see it was a banking community.
[time=3196] Cicero cashed in his letters of credit in that city.
[time=3200] But they were poor and so they had to get gold from him that was tried in the fire.
[time=3204] That's faith in Jesus Christ that cannot be taken away.
[time=3208] They had to buy from him white clothing.
[time=3210] They were famous as a garment district.
[time=3212] They had sheep on their heels that had the thickest, blackest wool and only nobility and royalty could afford the black wool and garments of Laodicea.
[time=3220] But they didn't need a black garment.
[time=3222] They needed a white one of righteousness in Christ.
[time=3225] They were a church just like Evie Hill described his church.
[time=3229] They were vague or they were vogue on the outside and vague on the inside.
[time=3235] He said, "You need to buy from me, saith for your eyes."
[time=3241] They had a medical school in Laodicea.
[time=3243] They exported tablets that were actually therapy for damaged eyes.
[time=3248] And you crushed them and put them in water and it was very therapeutic.
[time=3253] These people needed to know that they didn't have the right clothing.
[time=3256] They didn't have the right purchasing power.
[time=3258] They didn't have the right sav for their spiritual blindness.
[time=3261] They needed to recognize that they needed to come to Christ.
[time=3265] Secondly, they needed to realize that God would deal severely with them.
[time=3270] Verse 19, "Those I love, I will rebuke and discipline." Rebuke means to verbally correct.
[time=3277] Discipline means to physically correct.
[time=3279] God loves his church.
[time=3281] He loves this church even though we're a mixed multitude.
[time=3284] Some are a real believer.
[time=3285] Some are false professors and he still loves us.
[time=3288] They'll discipline us.
[time=3291] They'll verbally rebuke us and then they'll discipline us.
[time=3294] It's usually in the form of persecution.
[time=3296] We do not wealth, we do not recognize.
[time=3299] He will deal severely within difference and in sensitivity.
[time=3304] Third prescription of this remedy is the repent of our indifference.
[time=3309] He tells us to do two things.
[time=3311] Change our attitude and to change our actions.
[time=3315] Rebuke and discipline so be earnest and repent.
[time=3320] To be earnest means to change your attitude.
[time=3322] Do no longer be lukewarm but to become hot and alive and dynamic.
[time=3326] To become radical for Jesus Christ.
[time=3329] To radically change our attitudes.
[time=3334] Most of us don't like the word radical because it speaks as somebody who's in the street with a sign in one hand and a brick in the other hand ready to throw it through a window.
[time=3342] It's not what the word radical means at all.
[time=3344] Radical is exactly what it means in mathematics.
[time=3347] It means to get to the root of.
[time=3350] And somebody who is radical gets to the root of life and puts Jesus Christ at the core of it at all.
[time=3357] And we need to be vibrant and alive and earnest and zealous.
[time=3361] It needs to reflect in our time that we are radical.
[time=3364] That if somebody took out our daytime and looked at our week they saw all these commitments that rang of spiritual life
[time=3370] and they'd say you are radically committed to Christ.
[time=3374] Somebody took out our checkbook and they looked at the ledger.
[time=3377] They would see financial commitments to churches and to Christian missions and to Christ's pregnancy centers and the college outreach programs and they would look at how we spent our money and they'd say you are radically committed to Christ.
[time=3390] He said change your attitude of apathy and indifference.
[time=3395] It becomes zealous.
[time=3396] Become earnest.
[time=3397] And then change your actions.
[time=3399] Repent.
[time=3400] Repent doesn't mean to say I'm sorry and I'll try to stop.
[time=3403] Repent means to see what I'm doing as sin and to stop it.
[time=3406] You see if you came to Jesus Christ as your Savior last week and you have been cheating your employer by lying about your expenses on your budget
[time=3416] and if you've been cheating your employer by lying on your time sheet and you've given your heart to Christ you stop it.
[time=3423] You never do it again because you're radically committed to Him.
[time=3427] And if you've given your heart to Jesus Christ and you've been living with your boyfriend or girlfriend
[time=3433] you stop it you move out you don't say it's a platonic relationship I don't have anywhere else to live you get out of it because you're radically committed to Christ.
[time=3443] If you're married and you're not sexually faithful to your spouse or if you're not emotionally faithful to your spouse and you've given your heart to Christ you get out of that relationship and you honor your spouse because you're radically committed to Christ.
[time=3459] If you're a college student and everybody parties on your campus and you've given your heart to Christ you get out of the party scene because you are radically committed to Him.
[time=3471] If you're a high school student and you've given your heart to Christ and this is the spring fling and this is the time when everybody goes to show apart and passes it from car to car you get out of it because you are radically committed.
[time=3488] We've been pleased today to bring you the music from our Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra duet by Keith and star Brontagum and soloist Kevin Rowe.

[time=3500] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3508] Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=3510] Dear Heavenly Father, I counted a privilege to come and bow before you and tell you that I have sins that I've committed and I know that you can give me eternal life.
[time=3521] I ask you to come into my heart today and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3526] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3530] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
