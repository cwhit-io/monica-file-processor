[time=111] Parenting has become a lost art and a lost commitment in America. Allow me to share with you the results of two different surveys.
[time=121] The first revealed that mothers of newborn babies returned to the workforce at a rate of 50.9%. That means that slightly over half of mothers of brand new children leave the baby in someone else's care and go off to work.
[time=138] 56% of the mothers of preschool children are in the workforce. But more troubling than that is the record of we who are fathers.
[time=148] A group of fathers were asked how much time they thought they spent with their children daily. They estimated somewhere around 20 minutes a day to verify their claim.
[time=159] A microphone was put inside the shirt of small children. And the study revealed that fathers spent an average of 15 seconds a day talking directly with their children.
[time=173] [MUSIC]
[time=188] Welcome to an hour of Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible hour. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled Christianity at the close of the 20th century part two.
[time=200] A moment ago Rick shared some alarming statistics with us about the lack of parental involvement in the lives of our children. Today is Mother's Day here at Black Hawk and our message is a plea for parents to recommit themselves to the high calling of being a mom and a dad.
[time=216] Today we focus on the lack of commitment to our families. We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us. Our special music today will be provided by the Singing Men.
[time=230] The men singers quartet and Brian Losen. The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=247] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you. Now here's Rick.
[time=254] Welcome our friends. We join us for the Bible hour. We trust that God will use this hour to his glory. We have the privilege today that we have put together under Peter's leadership, a choir of men.
[time=266] They are calling themselves for the day, the singing men, and they are going to sing for us. A great hymn. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=276] Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=286] Great is thy faithfulness. Morning my morning, new mercies I see. All I have been in my hand have grown by them. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=309] Morning to me. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning to me. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning to me.
[time=322] Morning to me. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=348] Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=353] Morning my morning, new mercies I see. All I have been in my hand have grown by them. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=375] War and fury.
[time=382] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest.
[time=390] Sun, moon and stars in their courses above.
[time=399] Joy with all nature in men and full greatness.
[time=407] Morning to me. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=422] Morning my morning, new mercies I see. All I have been in my hand have grown by them.
[time=436] Great is thy faithfulness.
[time=447] Morning to me. Morning to me.
[time=466] [APPLAUSE]
[time=475] When we organized yesterday morning they looked good and then I talked to them a while and I said, you know, you might think that get the idea that I'm stalling a little bit because I wasn't sure what the sound was going to be.
[time=487] When they opened their mouths yesterday after we had a word of prayer and sang about the great faithfulness of our Lord.
[time=493] I'm just thrilled that so many men God has given marvelous voices to and yet they're willing to use them for His glory.
[time=500] We praise the Lord for you men and thank you for that.
[time=503] Let's talk a little bit about heaven and continue to get a taste of that as we worship together.
[time=508] Singing Him number 542. When we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus.
[time=516] Him number 542. Singing the first and third stanzas together.
[time=521] [MUSIC]
[time=535] Singing the first and third stanzas together.
[time=542] [MUSIC]
[time=562] Singing the first and third stanzas together.
[time=573] [MUSIC]
[time=593] Singing the first and third stanzas together.
[time=609] Sing the course one time now sing it out when we all get to heaven.
[time=619] [MUSIC]
[time=641] Well living up in heaven with those that we love is going to be a glorious time living with them down below.
[time=647] That's kind of another story but we trust that this morning as we fellowship together that our hearts are tuned to those things above and we continue with this theme as the quartet sings your first day in heaven.
[time=662] [MUSIC]
[time=675] Oh it's a great great morning or first day in heaven when you scroll down the golden avenue.
[time=682] There are mansions left and right and you thrill to every side and the saints are always smiling saying
[time=689] How do you do? Oh it's a great great morning.
[time=692] Your first day in heaven when you realize your worrying days are through.
[time=697] You'll be glad you're not idle to time.
[time=700] Read your Bible. It's a great great morning for you.
[time=705] I had a dream and I confess I hated to awake.
[time=709] You 20 was St. Peter at the Great Pearly Gate.
[time=713] St. Peter said why where have you been?
[time=717] We've got your mention ready so come right in.
[time=721] And then he ran for an angel to act as a gun.
[time=725] He spread his wings of time or two and learned how to fly.
[time=728] Oh it's a great great morning your first day in heaven when you stroll down the golden avenue.
[time=736] There are mansions left and right and you thrill to every side and the saints are always smiling saying
[time=742] How do you do? Oh it's a great great morning.
[time=745] Your first day in heaven when you realize your worrying days are through.
[time=751] You'll be glad you're not idle to time.
[time=754] Read your Bible. It's a great morning.
[time=757] A great morning.
[time=759] What a happy day.
[time=768] [APPLAUSE]
[time=776] [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=896] [APPLAUSE]
[time=904] Hello again and thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour here today.
[time=909] It's Mother's Day here at Black Hawk and we have the privilege of broadcasting the Bible Hour out of San Leandro California.
[time=918] And in the shadow of that city is where Pete Coby's mother lives.
[time=921] So would you like to say Happy Mother's Day to your mom?
[time=924] Well I think that's a great privilege Rick.
[time=926] Hello mom and Happy Mother's Day.
[time=928] I hope it was a great day for you.
[time=930] We enjoy this privilege of being able to communicate at least in one way to my mom in this brief time.
[time=937] Well we are thankful we can share the Bible Hour here in Fort Wayne.
[time=941] Other parts of Indiana, Ohio and also in San Leandro California.
[time=946] Well we got a call actually we called my mom last night and wished her a Happy Mother's Day.
[time=951] She said that one of the churches, the Calvary Baptist Church, Jim Boyd is the pastor and conquered and announced it in his Sunday morning service to watch.
[time=959] So I think the word is getting out a little bit.
[time=961] Well that's great.
[time=962] That's great.
[time=963] And we do wish all of you mothers a very joyful time during this month of May.
[time=967] And today we hope to encourage mothers as we study God's Word to be faithful to the responsibility and to see being a mother
[time=975] as a very high calling and privilege from God.
[time=978] This morning we want to invite you to some coming events in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=983] Now I know you friends in California probably can't come but our Indiana friends and perhaps even some of the Ohio and Michigan friends
[time=990] could join us.
[time=991] We have a summer Bible conference on Wednesday nights in the month of June.
[time=996] And during that time we have a great celebration of God's Word and of study and of encouragement.
[time=1002] And we begin this year with a film titled A Man Called Norman.
[time=1007] It's a film that's received great praise and popularity.
[time=1010] Dr. Dobson has a spoken so highly of it that many of us are looking forward to seeing it.
[time=1015] And that will be June the 7th here as the lead-off in the summer Bible conference.
[time=1021] During the month of June the summer Bible conference will continue for four weeks and will end with Bruce Dunn.
[time=1027] And that leads us to July with the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1030] Well Rick we're already preparing for that great day.
[time=1033] We're titling this year's Patriotic Panorama Look Up America.
[time=1037] And again it's just some great songs concerning our country and our God and our thankfulness to him for the privilege
[time=1044] to live in the United States of America.
[time=1046] One of the highlights is you're going to be helping us out this year in the presentation of some of the presidents.
[time=1051] I think that's going to be a unique part of our Patriotic Panorama this year.
[time=1056] And special guests will be the Sounds Alive.
[time=1059] Former group that traveled from Black Hawk.
[time=1061] It's been 11 years since they've been together and they're coming back for a reunion and a great time on July 2nd.
[time=1067] I'm looking forward to hearing the Sounds Alive again.
[time=1070] We were together back in those days when you had that group put together.
[time=1074] It'll be a great reunion for all of us.
[time=1076] It should be a great day and we're looking forward to having some of you come.
[time=1080] If you can put that date aside, it's Sunday, July 2nd at 4 o'clock here in the worship center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1088] This is a particularly good year to emphasize patriotism.
[time=1091] It's always an important responsibility for us as believers in Christ to pray for our government
[time=1097] and to give thanks for our rich spiritual heritage.
[time=1100] But this year particularly so.
[time=1102] This is the year that we celebrate 200 years of the American presidency.
[time=1107] Many of you are thinking I thought our bicentennial was in 1776 to 1976.
[time=1112] That's true.
[time=1113] But for 13 years we functioned under the Articles of Confederation and it wasn't until 1789 that our presidency was born.
[time=1123] So this year we celebrate 200 years of an American presidency and that'll be a part of the Panorama.
[time=1129] Good.
[time=1130] We're looking forward to all of the music and the special event concerning the presidents of the United States.
[time=1135] Well today again is Mother's Day and we have a helpful little pamphlet to share with mothers.
[time=1140] It's called Mom's Don't Yell and Other Myths.
[time=1144] You know if you have children that it's impossible to be the mythological super mom that's often portrayed by either television programs or perhaps by preachers.
[time=1154] It's an earthly task but it's a heavenly calling and this pamphlet will put some humor, some joy back into that privilege of being a mother.
[time=1163] So we want to send you a copy on this Mother's Day.
[time=1166] If you'll simply write and ask for it, we'll send it to you.
[time=1169] You may want to request it for your mom.
[time=1171] You can receive this free pamphlet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1183] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1191] Also at the same time we want to share a booklet with you with the simple one word title, Money.
[time=1196] We're talking about Christianity at the close of the 20th century.
[time=1200] We're talking about commitment and priorities.
[time=1203] Today we'll talk about the commitment and priority of the family.
[time=1207] Next week we'll talk about commitment financially.
[time=1210] Many of us look at money and we see it as a neutral commodity.
[time=1214] When actually the Bible tells us it's a rival to God Himself.
[time=1218] But it's also a resource from God and we want to balance the perspective on money.
[time=1223] And so we send you this booklet to help you wrestle with that issue in your personal life.
[time=1228] One final time, Pete, would you share the address?
[time=1230] I hope you'll take advantage of both of these offers by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1241] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here on Mother's Day for the Bible Hour.
[time=1256] [MUSIC - 159 seconds]
[time=1442] Lord, we thank You for the Savior who lights our way.
[time=1447] And we would ask Him now to illuminate our minds and do enlighten our hearts and help us to see life from your perspective.
[time=1457] Give us an eternal view of living today.
[time=1462] Meet with us, Lord.
[time=1464] We ask You to make your word relevant, alive, and fresh.
[time=1469] Help us today to sense your presence, not only in a service or a song, but in our daily living.
[time=1478] We pray today on this Mother's Day that You'll give to each Mother here a sense of worth in their labor of love.
[time=1487] In the time, the hours, the years they've invested in to us, their children.
[time=1494] We pray that You would give them an increased measure of strength and perseverance, particularly to those who are in the early years of raising small children.
[time=1505] We pray that You would give comfort to mothers who have walked through the valley of the shadow of death and who have gone through the hardship of bearing a child.
[time=1516] May this day find Your grace overcoming their hurt.
[time=1522] We pray for those who have lost their Mother in recent months since we last celebrated this occasion.
[time=1531] Your grace and strength would be their help.
[time=1535] We pray today for men that You would turn our hearts towards home, that You would give us a view of a Father as a high and noble calling.
[time=1545] And so as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, give us a sense that being a family is being blessed.
[time=1557] We would pray today that You would be with those who are concerned about their children physically, for Anne, George and Janetta Wiggins' daughter.
[time=1566] She recovers from gunshot wounds.
[time=1569] And for those who are worried about their children spiritually, we would pray for You to work in hearts.
[time=1576] Thank You for those that came to Christ last hour.
[time=1580] We would pray for our country and that You would give stability in our land and in our world.
[time=1586] We pray for the young men who will defend freedom and Panama.
[time=1591] We pray particularly for Paul Macintosh there that You would keep him safe.
[time=1597] We pray that You would increase our peace, that we might know the blessing of Your hand.
[time=1605] And again, we thank You for our mothers as we honor them today.
[time=1608] We too want to honor You, Lord, in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1616] We do want to honor all of the mothers here today with the track that we'll be passing out as you leave, but we have a bouquet of flowers over here.
[time=1626] For one particular mother that we would like to honor today.
[time=1630] First of all, could I ask all of the mothers, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers who are here today, would you stand right now and then just remain standing?
[time=1639] All of the moms, would you please stand right now?
[time=1642] Oh, there's a great group of them.
[time=1645] I'm really glad to see all of you.
[time=1647] Last hour, we had an unusually large attendance.
[time=1651] So large that I thought, hmm, they all came the first service today.
[time=1655] So to see you as a real treat for me, I thought it was going to be Ray and Dale and Pete and I.
[time=1660] Ladies, we're glad that we can honor You.
[time=1662] Can I ask all of the mothers of two or more children or great-grandchildren or grandchildren who are here worshiping at Blackhawk today to stay standing and the rest of you may be seated?
[time=1674] If you've got two children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren worshiping here today, great.
[time=1679] Please stay standing if you have three or more here today.
[time=1684] Four or more children, grandchildren or great-grandchildren.
[time=1694] We still have a few.
[time=1695] Good.
[time=1696] Six or more.
[time=1698] Anybody with six or more?
[time=1701] Six or more children?
[time=1703] Oh, in the balcony.
[time=1704] I'm sorry.
[time=1705] I can't even see up that far.
[time=1707] Good.
[time=1709] All right.
[time=1710] Is there anybody else standing?
[time=1711] We have six.
[time=1712] Is that your mom, Gary, all the way up there?
[time=1715] Well, Gary, we're going to give you the job of giving this to your mom.
[time=1719] Gary, would you come get this?
[time=1720] We're not going to make your mom come from the top row of the balcony, but we can send a son that far.
[time=1725] There you go, Gary.
[time=1726] Would you give that to your mom and congratulations to all the mothers.
[time=1729] You can take it to her now.
[time=1731] We don't trust you.
[time=1732] That'll get there later.
[time=1734] Good.
[time=1735] Well, we're delighted to have all of you here today, worshiping with us at Black Hawk and the privilege of honoring mothers.
[time=1741] If you have a Bible, open it please to Psalm 27.
[time=1746] Psalm 27.
[time=1749] In this month of May, we're looking at this theme, Christianity at the close of the 20th
[time=1757] century.
[time=1758] Last week out of Revelation chapter 3, we talked about commitment to Christ.
[time=1763] And at the church at the end of the 20th century is that church that John would describe as lukewarm, lost our fire, not cold and totally indifferent to Christ, but lukewarm, growing
[time=1776] in the direction of indifference.
[time=1778] And Jesus said that such a church, such an individual, he would reject as detestable.
[time=1785] And so our challenge last week out of God's Word for the church at the close of the 20th
[time=1791] century was a renewed commitment to Christ.
[time=1794] Today on Mother's Day, we speak not just to mothers, but the fathers as well, on renewed commitment to the family.
[time=1802] Psalm 27 verse 1, Psalm 127 verse 1, "Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor
[time=1813] in vain, and lest the Lord watches over the city, the watchman stands guard in vain.
[time=1822] In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat.
[time=1830] For he grants sleep to those he loves, sons are heritage from the Lord, children a reward
[time=1838] from him, like arrows in the hands of a warrior, our sons born in one's youth.
[time=1848] Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.
[time=1853] They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gates.
[time=1860] This is a song of Solomon, one of the wisest men of all time.
[time=1865] God uniquely blessed him with wisdom, and he turns our attention to the blessing of parenting,
[time=1871] of being a mother, of being a father, that children are indeed a heritage.
[time=1877] One of my favorite writers is a lady you'll know by name, Irma Baumbach, a witty, gifted
[time=1884] author.
[time=1885] She has penned books like at Whits End, The Grass is always greener over the septic tank,
[time=1893] the family, the tie that binds and gags.
[time=1899] It's from that last work that I want to share, this extended story of hers with you.
[time=1905] It's titled The Family, 1936.
[time=1910] She writes, "It was the best of times.
[time=1913] I had my own watch, a tricycle, and a clip-on Shirley Temple hair ribbon that covered the
[time=1921] entire right side of my head.
[time=1924] My mother wore an apron and silk stockings, and baked every day.
[time=1931] She looked like Betty Crocker before she had her face lift, pierced earrings, and junk
[time=1937] to make her hair fat.
[time=1940] The family, all four of us sat on the front porch in the summer and talked about the squeak and the swing.
[time=1948] My dad always told me to get my tricycle off the sidewalk at night before somebody fell over it.
[time=1954] I never did.
[time=1956] My mother cleaned the living room every day.
[time=1959] We never sat in it.
[time=1963] Once I turned on one of the lights and the cellophane around the lampshade smelled and I got my hands slapped.
[time=1971] Mom cut the grass, filled the clothesline every day.
[time=1975] Every Friday, she hosed out the garbage cans.
[time=1979] In the spring, she really got crazy, lugging mattresses out into the backyard and setting
[time=1985] up curtain rods to dry the lace curtains.
[time=1989] Sometimes she put on gloves and a hat with her best dress and took the streetcar into
[time=1995] town where she went from store to store, paying the utilities and making 50 cent payments
[time=2001] on my watch and tricycle.
[time=2005] One morning, my father didn't get up and go to work.
[time=2008] He went to the hospital.
[time=2010] He died the next day.
[time=2014] I hadn't thought much about him before.
[time=2016] He was just someone who laughed and came home and seemed glad to see everyone at night.
[time=2022] He opened jars of pickles when nobody else could.
[time=2025] He was the only one in the house who wasn't afraid to go into the basement by himself.
[time=2032] He cut himself shaving, but no one kissed it or got excited about it.
[time=2038] It was understood when it rained he got the car and brought it around to the door.
[time=2043] When everyone was sick, he went to get the prescription filled.
[time=2046] He took lots of pictures but was never in any of them.
[time=2051] Whenever I played house, the mother doll had a lot to do.
[time=2054] I never knew what to do with the daddy doll, so I tucked him under the bed and said there, he went off to work.
[time=2063] The funeral was in our living room and a lot of people came and brought all kinds of good
[time=2069] food and cakes.
[time=2071] We never had so much company before.
[time=2074] I went into my room and felled under the bed for the daddy doll.
[time=2078] When I found him, I dusted him off and put him on my bed.
[time=2084] He never did anything.
[time=2086] I don't know how his leaving could hurt so much.
[time=2091] The creditors came the next day after the funeral and carved it off the ice box, the car and the contents of the living room that no one ever sat in.
[time=2100] My mother got a job.
[time=2102] No one in my entire class had a mother who went to work every day.
[time=2107] I didn't tell anybody but my best friend.
[time=2111] She got mad at me and blabbed it all over the whole school.
[time=2116] In 1938, my mother said, "We're going to be a family again and introduce us to a stepfather."
[time=2125] I was the only girl in North America to have a stepfather.
[time=2130] I didn't take a chance on telling even my best friend.
[time=2135] My stepfather and I didn't talk to one another for a while.
[time=2138] I guess he was a person who didn't know how to show love.
[time=2142] I remember when he taught me how to ride a two-wheel bicycle.
[time=2146] I told him not to let go but he did and I fell and mom came running and he waved her back.
[time=2152] "Oh, I was so mad I showed him.
[time=2155] I got back on that bike and rode it by myself." He didn't even get embarrassed, he just smiled.
[time=2166] When I went away to college, he didn't hang around the talk like mom did.
[time=2169] He just logged 15 pieces of luggage up to the third floor and stood sort of awkward.
[time=2178] Whenever I called home, he acted like he wanted to talk but he always said, "I'll get your mother." All my life, he nagged, "Where are you going?
[time=2189] What time are you coming home?
[time=2191] Do you have enough gas in the car?
[time=2193] Who else is going?" "No, you're not going." It was a long time before I realized that's how you love someone.
[time=2204] My mother pursued a career at a factory assembly line making rubber door strips for General Motors.
[time=2209] My stepfather dedicated his life to making me pick up towels in the bathroom and turning off lights.
[time=2217] I can hardly wait to get married, to leave home, and to have a family of my own with
[time=2224] a living room that no one ever sits in.
[time=2228] I don't know about you but that reminded me of home so well.
[time=2234] I can remember a living room that no one ever sat in.
[time=2238] I can remember a father who could teach you how to ride two-wheel bikes and wave moms sympathetic concern off at the same time.
[time=2246] I can remember street car rides, yes, electric trolleys that took us from the suburbs, the
[time=2253] downtown Akron.
[time=2254] I think the thing I remember the most is just about the time we got in front of O'Neill's department store mom would go like this.
[time=2262] She'd take her hanky out and then she would do one of the most despicable things a mother would ever do.
[time=2268] She'd lick that and then lunge for my face.
[time=2273] I'm not saying my face didn't need it, I'm just saying I didn't like it.
[time=2278] I remember those things.
[time=2281] You laugh because you remember those things.
[time=2285] I think the lesson we learn is this.
[time=2288] It's not the old times that we miss.
[time=2293] It's the relationships that were forged on the anvil of times that we viewed to be a bit harder.
[time=2301] We don't need the trolley cars or the squeaky port swings, but we miss the relationships.
[time=2310] The lesson I learned is this one.
[time=2312] In life, the meaning is as much in the journey as it is in the destination.
[time=2321] It matters as much how you get there as where you're going.
[time=2326] One of our fondest memories is the Hawks family is an annual vacation.
[time=2333] God has blessed us in so many ways.
[time=2336] One of the ways is the generosity of a family that provides a place for us to go on family vacation.
[time=2342] We go to Florida for two weeks.
[time=2345] My job is to make sure that everything can be packed into the family station wagon so there's room for everybody to sleep.
[time=2354] I'm compulsive, obsessively so, so on Saturdays I make sure everything fits and then I unpack
[time=2360] it so they can get everything in the suitcase.
[time=2363] My friend Bill said I run the only dress rehearsal in town for a family vacation.
[time=2369] My other job though is to get us there as quick as we can, 20 hours bouncing down the highway with five of us just seems a bit less than angelic to me.
[time=2382] This past week I asked the kids in anticipation of family vacation which is two weeks and 32 minutes from right now.
[time=2390] I said what's your best memory of vacation, what do you like best and one of the littlest two said the pool and swimming and the other of the littlest two said the amusement park.
[time=2401] I looked at the oldest and I said Rachel what's your favorite thing and she says the ride down
[time=2407] and back, well maybe she's not well, you know I have fantasies of snapping my fingers and
[time=2417] now we're there.
[time=2418] I said really you know and I went through the roll call of all the fun things that we've ever done in Florida and she's stuck to it, the ride down there and back.
[time=2430] My inquisitive nature was prompt the desk why she said because that's the time when
[time=2438] we're all together.
[time=2443] And again I learned that lesson.
[time=2446] The meaning in life is as much in the journey as it is in the destination and it matters
[time=2453] just as much how you go as where you're going.
[time=2459] But you have your Bible, look at Psalm 127 it calls us back to a deep and abiding commitment
[time=2467] to our family.
[time=2470] And Psalm 127 he gives us these two simple principles one we miss invest in our prosperity
[time=2480] and two we miss investing in our posterity.
[time=2485] The first we miss invest in our prosperity is found in verses one and two and lest the
[time=2491] Lord build the house its builders labor in vain and lest the Lord watches the city the
[time=2498] watchmen stand guard but in vain.
[time=2502] He gives us the principle of miss spent effort.
[time=2507] Here are two analogies that their world and ours alike would understand the first is the man who's building his house brick by brick he builds up the walls and until those structural
[time=2518] elements are standing and then he would span them with the timbers that would make ready a roof with diligence and effort a man can build a house.
[time=2531] You know it's totally possible men that we can build houses and fail to build homes.
[time=2538] And here the psalmist is warning us that we may be craftsmen we may be able to build
[time=2544] homes or we may be able to work in a completely different industry that provides the income to provide the house for our family though it's not the labor of our own knuckles and
[time=2556] yet when that house is provided with beauty and splendor it still may not be a home.
[time=2564] And we may take great pains to make our lawn look proudly like it's the show piece of
[time=2570] the neighborhood.
[time=2572] We may have painted its walls and trimmed its baseboard and hung the pictures in precisely the right place.
[time=2580] And as mothers we may have cleaned it when it didn't need clean just because the inspector from better housekeeping was coming someday.
[time=2588] And with all of our effort it can be totally miss spent if the Lord is not the core of our
[time=2596] family.
[time=2598] It can be totally miss spent effort because the greatest legacy we leave for our children
[time=2608] is not that which they inherit from us in the way of material but that which they inherit
[time=2614] from us of a spiritual legacy.
[time=2620] Charles Haddon Spurgeon once said, "Mother I would not be the man that I am today if
[time=2629] you were not the woman that you were." We must put the priority not on prosperity not on building empires or building dynasties
[time=2643] in the language of television but of building a home where the Lord is the very core of
[time=2652] what we do.
[time=2654] The second analogy he gives is of the city.
[time=2657] The walled city that would be surrounded for protection and at its strategic points would have towers and amidst the tower would be a watchman who would keep his eye out no matter
[time=2669] how diligent the army no matter how clear-eyed the watchman unless the Lord watches the city.
[time=2677] The watchman stands guard in vain.
[time=2682] Abraham Lincoln made an impassionate speech before a country and he said that all the armies of Europe combined could not take a drink out of the Ohio or make a track on the
[time=2693] Blue Ridge and if our fall is to come it will come not from an enemy without but from ourselves
[time=2702] within.
[time=2703] You see a watchman can guard a city against an external enemy but if the Lord is not built
[time=2710] into the fabric of the lives of the people of that city the enemy is already on the inside
[time=2716] and the watchman stands guard in vain.
[time=2721] Then moves to the consequences of miss spent effort to miss spent energy.
[time=2728] Verse 2, "Invane you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat, for he grants sleep to those he loves." You see the working world of materialism we live in always says work harder, get ahead.
[time=2743] Take a second job, make a little more.
[time=2745] If both of you work just think how you could move up.
[time=2748] You could have a nicer house.
[time=2750] You could fill the garage that's already overflowing with more stuff if we both just had an income.
[time=2757] Suddenly we begin to take the precious gifts of our family and time and rest and we sacrifice
[time=2764] them on the altar of getting ahead and getting more.
[time=2771] He gives the sober reminder the Lord gives rest and he gives food to those who he loves.
[time=2780] Kathy and I as we contemplated this trip to Florida we have one very excellent car but
[time=2787] it's a mid-size and then we have an old faithful station wagon and we thought you know what this is the time we need to sell the old faithful station wagon and we need to get a newer,
[time=2798] bigger car and if you got a newer, bigger car that's fine and we said we need to get
[time=2804] a newer, bigger car because if we did just think how well everybody would sleep as we drive all night to Florida.
[time=2811] Then it dawned on us if we took that plan we would gain one night's sleep and then lose
[time=2817] one year's sleep paying it off.
[time=2820] It dawned on me the Lord would grant me sleep if I would just change the oil and old faithful
[time=2827] and I know it will make it again.
[time=2830] You know sometimes in life our happiness and our joy is right in front of us but we're
[time=2837] too busy working on the next day's happiness and the next day's joy and the next thing that we think it will bring it there and we fail to realize that we're miss investing
[time=2848] in prosperity and that causes us to miss investing in our posterity.
[time=2855] Take it versus three through five it challenges us to invest in our children.
[time=2861] It says children are heritage from the Lord, children are reward from Him like arrows in
[time=2867] the hands of a warrior our son's born in one's youth.
[time=2870] Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.
[time=2874] They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.
[time=2879] Here he describes children in four ways let me give them to you quickly and then we'll take a slower look.
[time=2886] One they're a heritage, two children are reward, three they're a blessing and four children
[time=2894] are protection.
[time=2896] By heritage he is saying this and inheritance our heritage is that which a father or mother
[time=2903] leaves to their children and children to grandchildren and God says I am the eternal father and
[time=2910] I am going to leave you and heritage and inheritance a gift from me the eternal father
[time=2919] to you and they are children of your own.
[time=2924] God says I'm going to bless your life with the most precious gift that of children.
[time=2931] Secondly he says that they are a reward, they are not a burden or a penalty but actually
[time=2938] a gift from God.
[time=2941] It's a reward his way of showing us that he really loves us the provision of children.
[time=2950] Thirdly he says that they are a blessing.
[time=2954] He said blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.
[time=2960] Happy is the family who has children and lots of them.
[time=2965] That runs counter to most of what we see and sense in our society.
[time=2971] Our society views children as anything but a blessing and a heritage and a reward.
[time=2978] Kathy and I were traveling we picked up a newspaper in a different community where we were visiting.
[time=2984] The article was about the frustration of parents.
[time=2987] The paraphrase it said this I work all day, work long hard hours when I come home I'm tired
[time=2995] and my wife, she works all day too you know and her job is stressful.
[time=3002] And our problem is this we can't find anybody to take care of our kids in the evening because
[time=3009] you know we need some time off when we both get home from work.
[time=3014] My little heart was aching because here was a couple it says early in the morning at seven
[time=3021] we drop off our children at one day care center.
[time=3024] We both go to work to gain our prosperity then we both come home and now we want to enjoy our prosperity but these kids are in the way.
[time=3033] And the problem with our society is no one's providing day care at night time so we can enjoy it all.
[time=3041] Let me give you some grim statistics from several different sources.
[time=3046] First one is this, that within two weeks after giving birth to a child 50.6% of the mothers
[time=3054] will be back in the work world, 56% of the mothers of preschool children are in the workforce
[time=3063] full time.
[time=3065] For fathers the statistics are even worse, a group of fathers were asked how much time
[time=3071] do you spend with your preschool children and the dad said oh I don't know, oh let's
[time=3077] see, oh 20 or 30 minutes a day at least.
[time=3081] And so a study was done to document their 20 or 30 minutes a day a microphone much like
[time=3087] mine was put on the children for a week.
[time=3091] And it was recorded that the fathers averaged 2.7 encounters with their children a day.
[time=3099] The average length was 15 seconds.
[time=3107] In another survey that Bruce Arcell, today told me about children were asked if you had
[time=3113] to give up dad or you had to give up the TV set which would go and they all lunged for
[time=3120] the TV set to protect it.
[time=3125] Let me tell you what I'm not saying.
[time=3127] I'm not saying men you're wrong if you work hard and you work overtime.
[time=3132] There's nowhere I know in the Bible that says thou shall work 40 hours a week and no more.
[time=3137] You're not wrong to work and to work overtime.
[time=3142] Women you're not wrong if you have children and you work.
[time=3146] Some of us need to.
[time=3150] Then what is the point?
[time=3151] Well the point is in trying to legislate men you can work 45 hours a week but you can't work this day.
[time=3158] We're not trying to say mom if you have a 3 year old you can only work this many hours and if you have 1 year old it's less.
[time=3164] There's no mathematical formula.
[time=3166] There's no easy solution.
[time=3169] My point is this.
[time=3170] That in the priorities of life parenting in the words of Ford Motor Company is job 1.
[time=3180] But what we do in life we are a parent first and an employee second.
[time=3187] Our work as parents comes before our work in the workforce.
[time=3193] I'm wise enough to know you can't say to your boss sorry I'm late for the fifth day in the row but you know parenting is job 1.
[time=3202] It is a tough assignment to balance it all but most of us when we fail to balance it we
[time=3208] fail to balance it at the expense of our family and at the gain of our status in the
[time=3215] office place.
[time=3219] The fourth thing he says about children is they are protection.
[time=3223] Here he pictures a man going out in the battle and the lead men are the archers who are going
[time=3229] ahead and they're launching the arrows and think of the man who reaches back at the front of the line in his arrows are gone.
[time=3237] This quiver is empty.
[time=3241] As we grow older our children are our protection in the battlefield from our enemies.
[time=3246] But then he says when they contend with their enemies in the gate they'll not be ashamed.
[time=3251] There was no court, appellate court, a supreme court.
[time=3254] When you had a civil dispute you went to the gates of the city and there the established older men of the city would pass down judgment.
[time=3261] There would come a day when you could no longer represent your health but your sons would
[time=3267] represent you.
[time=3268] They were your protection out there and in here.
[time=3275] Edipus was right.
[time=3277] When he answered the riddle what is it that walks on four legs and then two and then three?
[time=3283] He said man, for a man is born crawling on all fours, rises to adulthood when he walks
[time=3289] on two legs and then needs the assistance of a cane in his senior years and he is on three legs.
[time=3295] In those days when we return the three legs it's our children who are our strength.
[time=3302] Humorously a young man at the bill, Gather concert a week ago said parents of hyperactive children be nice to them because when you're old they'll determine what nursing home you go into.
[time=3316] Life has a way of going full cycle.
[time=3319] In our youth we protect our children and in our senior years they protect them.
[time=3325] The bottom line is this, I marvel at those men who work extra hours and still are great
[time=3331] dads and many are.
[time=3333] I marvel and my hat is off to the women who work and are still great moms.
[time=3338] There are those that somehow are Wonder Woman and Super Mom and I don't criticize that at all.
[time=3346] But my plea is to put you in mind that parenting is job one and as Christianity faces the end
[time=3352] of the 20th century how will they mark the legacy we've left?
[time=3358] Senator Coates told this story when he was a congressman.
[time=3362] A congressman brought his son to Dan and said son tell Dan what you want to be.
[time=3367] Little boy piked up I want to be a hockey player, a dad and a congressman.
[time=3372] Oh that congressman was proud.
[time=3375] A few months later he was doing the same thing Dan was observing it again but this time to do a third congressman he said son tell this congressman what you want to be and a little boy said I want to be a hockey player and I want to be a dad.
[time=3387] A congressman said well what else do you want to be.
[time=3391] A congressman remember?
[time=3392] He said no you don't have enough time to be a dad and to be a congressman.
[time=3401] Job one.
[time=3403] Remember Harry Chapin's words the cats in the cradle?
[time=3407] My child arrived just the other day he came to the world in the usual way but there were planes to catch and bills to pay he learned to walk while I was away and he was talking
[time=3417] before I knew it and as he grew he'd say I'm going to be like you dad you know I want
[time=3423] to be just like you and the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon.
[time=3427] Little boy blue and the man on the moon when you come home dad I don't know well but we'll get together then you know we'll have a good time then.
[time=3436] My son turned ten just the other day he said thanks for the ball dad come on let's play
[time=3442] can you teach me to throw?
[time=3444] I said not today I've got a lot to do and he said that's okay and he walked away and his smile never dimmed it said I'm going to be like him yeah you know I'm going to be
[time=3455] like him and the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon little boy blue and the man on the moon when you come home dad I don't know when but we'll get together then you know
[time=3466] we'll have a good time then.
[time=3469] Well he came home from college just the other day so much like a man I just had to say son I'm proud of you can we sit for a while he shook his head and he said with a smile what I'd really like dad is to borrow the keys I have the car I'll see you later please when
[time=3485] you come at home son I don't know when but we'll get together then you know we'll have a good time then I've long since retired my son moved away I called him up just the other
[time=3495] day I'd like to see you if you don't mind he said I'd love to you dad if I could find
[time=3501] the time you see the new jobs a hassle and the kids have the flu but it's sure nice talking
[time=3507] to you dad it's been nice talking to you as I hung up the phone it occurred to me he
[time=3513] had grown up just like me my boy was just like me.
