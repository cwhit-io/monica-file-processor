[time=0] God, from the praises of the praises I have never been to me.
[time=12] I will never be free.
[time=19] Let's pray together.
[time=26] Our Father in Heaven, that's our desire this morning to lift up songs of praises to you.
[time=31] We worship together, Lord, because we're a body, and we are not complete if our parts aren't here together.
[time=59] God bless you.
[time=89] (Bell) The impact of our churches on society as a whole has dwindled and diminished
[time=118] over the last three decades to the world doesn't even know who Jesus Christ is.
[time=124] Our Lady went to the jewelry store.
[time=126] And peering into the showcase, she said to the jeweler, "I'd like to buy a cross." "Fine," he said.
[time=132] "Would you like a silver one or a gold one?" "A gold, I think," she responded.
[time=139] "Okay," said the jeweler.
[time=141] "Do you want a plain one or one with that little man on it?"
[time=148] [MUSIC]
[time=159] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Ox.
[time=162] Thank you for joining us.
[time=163] Rick's Message today is entitled Christianity at the Close of the 20th Century, Part III.
[time=170] Christianity at the Close of the 20th Century has been the focus of our study for the last two weeks.
[time=175] In the previous messages, we have examined our commitment to the Lord and our commitment to our families.
[time=181] Today, Rick will be speaking on our commitment to the church.
[time=184] The illustration of a cross with a little man on it vividly portrays the diminishing effect of the church in our society.
[time=191] Our church's lack impact because our people lack commitment.
[time=195] We are praying that this will be an hour of rededication both here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and with each of you who are joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=204] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Matthew, Chapter 16, verses 24 through 28.
[time=212] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=217] Other special music includes a song from Mirror, a solo from Sam Hepler, and Kim Johnson.
[time=229] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=237] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=241] Now here's Rick.
[time=246] I also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=251] It's our privilege today to worship God and to praise Him and to sing with our hearts how great thou art.
[time=258] Our choir is going to lead us in that majestic anthem of praise.
[time=262] And just at the end of it, we're going to have the privilege of joining them.
[time=267] So prepare your hearts to join our choir and praising God as we sing how great thou art.
[time=288] Oh, Lord, I know how great thou art.
[time=327] I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder.
[time=337] I fight throughout the universe this way.
[time=357] And where I flee, that far is unnecessary.
[time=370] Set him to God, I space and take him deep.
[time=384] And on the cross, I learn and guide me very.
[time=396] Be glad and guide to save the way I see.
[time=415] Then sings my soul, my Savior, God to thee.
[time=428] How great thou art.
[time=441] Then sings my soul, my Savior, God to thee.
[time=454] How great thou art.
[time=513] In the moment of this show.
[time=525] Then there shall play you.
[time=530] My God, my Savior, God to thee.
[time=550] How great thou art.
[time=563] Then sings my soul, my Savior, God to thee.
[time=576] How great thou art.
[time=616] How great thou art, I don't think that song will ever grow old here at Blackhawk Baptist Church or anywhere for that matter.
[time=623] We continue with that majesty and support as we sing a mighty fortress is our God, hymn number 26, singing verses 1, 2, and 4 of hymn number 26.
[time=647] How great thou art.
[time=822] Powerful truths in our music today.
[time=824] Thank you very much for participating.
[time=827] Today we have graduation at Black Hawk Christian School this evening.
[time=832] Today we are honoring and highlighting some of the music from our schools.
[time=838] Coming to you right now is Mir from Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=842] They are directed by Emily Pippen.
[time=845] A little bit later Sam Hepler, a senior at Black Hawk will be singing for us.
[time=849] And then a little later yet, Kim Johnson, a senior at Snyder High School will provide us with special music.
[time=855] This is Mir.
[time=858] [MUSIC - 75 seconds]
[time=955] [APPLAUSE]
[time=968] [MUSIC - 117 seconds]
[time=1110] Well, this is graduation Sunday here at Black Hawk, our own school. Black Hawk Christian School is hosting commencement services tonight.
[time=1119] And we're honoring all of our graduates from all the local high schools and universities today.
[time=1124] We hope that you're having a great Lord's Day as you join us and welcome Pete.
[time=1129] Thank you, Rick. I was amazed as I looked at the bulletin this morning to see how many young people were graduating from college.
[time=1135] It just seemed like yesterday graduated from Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1139] It's amazing how time does fly.
[time=1141] That's really true. And just as amazing, there are some people to put it mildly. They're older than I am and older than you are who are graduating from college.
[time=1149] Lots of people are returning back as well.
[time=1151] We see that even among our staff members here, some of the clerical staff has gone back and are getting degrees.
[time=1157] Well, we hope that this is a great commencement time for your family if you're having a graduate around the house.
[time=1163] It's a beautiful spring day here and we're thanking the Lord for that.
[time=1167] We were beginning to doubt his promise that he'd never destroy the world by water again.
[time=1171] We've had plenty of rain. Yesterday we had a soccer game and most of it was played in the mud.
[time=1176] Well, this is spring time and summer will soon be upon us and that brings to Black Hawk the summer Bible Conference.
[time=1183] And we want to encourage you to join us during the month of June on Wednesday nights at 7 o'clock for the summer Bible Conference.
[time=1191] Our first meeting will be on June the 7th when we'll host a film entitled A Man Called Mormon.
[time=1197] I'm sure many of you have heard of that film on different broadcasts, particularly Dr. Dobson's Focus on the Family.
[time=1204] Then coming on the 14th we'll be Ivan French on the 21st Carl Solvine and on the 28th Bruce Dunn,
[time=1211] who's pastor of Grace Presbyterian Church and has a weekly radio broadcast here in Fort Wayne and around the country.
[time=1218] And we're looking forward to those Wednesday night events.
[time=1221] And as soon as that was end we come to July in the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1225] You're right Rick, just as we close out the month of June on July 2nd we have our annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1231] This year that will be at 4 o'clock right here in the worship center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1236] And Rick we're going to have the Sounds Alive singing, a group called Reflections, Celebration, the Sanctuary Choir,
[time=1242] some special guests that will be with us and it'll be a great hour of celebrating the love that we have for our country.
[time=1250] Well I'm looking forward to that and this year is the 200th anniversary of the presidency of the United States.
[time=1257] It was in 1789 that George Washington became our first president.
[time=1262] And so from George to George Bush we've had 200 years of the chief executive officer of our country, the president.
[time=1270] And we hope you'll come celebrate with us God's blessing upon America.
[time=1275] During this month we're speaking in our messages on Christianity at the close of the 20th century.
[time=1282] We've already talked about our commitment to the Lord.
[time=1285] Last week our commitment to our families and this week the commitment to our church.
[time=1291] We are struggling in this generation, not we particularly here at Black Hawk but Christianity as a whole to have an impact on our society.
[time=1299] And that's because there's not a commitment on the part of our people.
[time=1303] Of their time, of their talent and of their treasure.
[time=1307] And so today we offer you this helpful booklet on managing your money from God's perspective.
[time=1314] The booklet has the simple one word title money.
[time=1318] It's written by Philip Yancy, an excellent author of Fine Christian Books, a shepherd's look at the 23rd Psalm and other works like that.
[time=1327] And so we want to give you this booklet if you'll write to us.
[time=1331] You can receive this booklet absolutely free today by writing to the Bible Hour.
[time=1335] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1343] Just ask for the booklet money right to the Bible Hour.
[time=1347] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1353] Thank you, Pete. Let me correct myself. Philip Keller wrote the book, "A Shepherd's Look at the 23rd Psalm." Philip Yancy wrote this book and we still hope you'll write for it. It's a good one.
[time=1362] Thanks for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1365] [MUSIC - 160 seconds]
[time=1533] I face the darkness so cold and long, looking for love, wanting to grow, wanting to sing.
[time=1547] I want to sing, I will survive, I'm life, I stand beside the crucifixion, I will move on, I will be strong, for my strength to live is not my own.
[time=1577] I will survive, I will survive, I will survive.
[time=1604] Thank you, Kim. We have the privilege in this service of recognizing our graduates, and so as I read the list of names, we would ask you to stand up.
[time=1614] It appeared in the last hour that most of the graduates were in the first service, but I've looked around and see quite a few of them here this hour.
[time=1622] First of all, graduating from high school, from our church, our Craig Albrecht, Christy Barkis, Dwan Dwyer Barton, Denise Beebe, Katie Burton, Kermit Biler, Sherman Carver, Lynette Crawford, Shelley Eastland, Joe Elijah, Kurt Emberland, Rick Evans, Heather Griffith, Shannon Hagerty, Joel Harms, Joey Hicks, Pam Hughes, Angela Ignace, Kim Johnson,
[time=1651] Melissa Jones, Jeff Kirschner, John Lehman, Wendy Lewis, Lori Pauls, Jeff Rob, Melanie Sandel, Kevin Tallman, Krista Williamson, Glenn Wills, and Amy Zaire.
[time=1664] Let's give a round of applause to these people.
[time=1674] These students are worthy of distinction, but I did want to make one note of something I learned this past week that Katie Burton of our church, a senior at Snyder, was responsible for the slogan that was used in our city to encourage high school students
[time=1689] during these celebrating days of graduation and proms not to drink, and so I'm so excited to see peer pressure being used in a positive way and well done to Katie.
[time=1702] I'm waiting from college, Marine Clouser, Brad Lautzenheiser, Ruth Pulver, Tanya Woods, Jacques Shengsivan, Lance Clark, Rebecca Darrowock, Michael Johnson, Amy Kistler, Michelle Liston, Michael Mansfield, Gregory Paragoy, Tina Renee Sawyer, Rosalind Scarf, Amy Beth Whitmer, and David Hackley.
[time=1729] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1735] And these people from our church are graduating with graduate degrees.
[time=1740] Lois Clancy, Master of Library Science from IU, Dennis Kirschner, Master of Science in Psychological Counseling, St. Francis College, you're supposed to stand, Dennis.
[time=1754] Lois Toth, Master of Business Administration from Indiana Wesleyan University, and Jim Pearson, Master of Divinity from Grace Seminary. Well done to these many years.
[time=1765] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1770] Now we have a final exam for each of you. Have you memorized Revelation 3, 15, and 16 on Commencement Sunday?
[time=1779] If you haven't, your sins be forgiven. You can read it as we memorize it and say it out loud. Steve will lead us. It's in the front of your bullet.
[time=1789] Let's stand together as we repeat our memory verse this morning. Revelation 3, 15, and 16, I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot.
[time=1804] I will shoot or the other because neither will be here.
[time=1819] Thank you very much. I'd like to now invite you to bow as we pray together.
[time=1830] My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. For thee all the follies of sin I resign. My gracious Redeemer, my Savior, art thou.
[time=1847] If ever I love thee, my Jesus, 'tis now. Lord, we do love you. And we come today to worship you. And from our hearts, whether our voices be talented or not, we shout out how great thou art.
[time=1865] And on this day, we've assembled here because we want to know you, to know your word, and to follow you fully.
[time=1874] We would ask you to speak to the heart of that man today who has come as a searcher to that woman who is a seeker. Not yet committed to Christ, but open.
[time=1885] We'd ask you to penetrate the walls of that individual soul who is callous and different, apathetic.
[time=1893] And they've come here today out of tradition or the request of someone else. We ask you to make your word real to them.
[time=1902] And to believers, may we be challenged to growth, to serve you for it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen.
[time=1914] What you are determines what you see. And what you see determines how you act.
[time=1923] And American Indian was walking with a friend of his through the busy congested streets of New York. On their sidewalk, it was literally shoulder to shoulder.
[time=1932] And horns were honking. Traffic was moving, and the sounds of the city were ominous. And Indian said to his friend, "Wait a minute. Do you hear that?
[time=1943] You hear what? I hear everything. I hear cricket. You hear a cricket? I hear horns and I hear angry people and I hear feet and I hear congestion.
[time=1954] What do you mean you hear a cricket? Man backed up and there in the crack of the sidewalk was a clump of grass. That's where grass grows best.
[time=1962] And he bent down and pulled the grass loose and out hopped a cricket.
[time=1967] His friend was amazing. He said, "How did you hear that?" He said, "I am an Indian. My year is used to hearing crickets."
[time=1977] He said, "Watch this." And he took his hand, put it in his pocket, pulled out three corns and dropped them on the sidewalk and all of New York came to a stop.
[time=1986] What we are determines what we see. And as we come today to study the Scripture, what we are determines, what we see, what we hear, what we sense.
[time=2000] And I hope that today you're committed to Jesus Christ. If you're not, I hope today that you see a Christ worthy of your love and your admiration.
[time=2011] In the passage that we're going to study today, he gives us a harsh, stern, demanding challenge. A tough word for a tough generation.
[time=2022] We've been studying Christianity at the close of the 20th century. In the first study we looked at our commitment to the Lord, that memory verse that you went over today.
[time=2033] Jesus said, "I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot." I wish that you were one or the other.
[time=2043] But because you are lukewarm, comfortably in the middle, neither hot nor cold, I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.
[time=2056] That passage challenges us to undivided devotion to Christ as Lord of our life.
[time=2064] Then last week we looked at commitment on Mother's Day to our family. At the end of the 20th century, one of the deteriorating fragments of our society waiting to be pieced together is the family.
[time=2080] Today I point our attention to the church and our commitment to it. If you have a Bible, I invite you to open it to Matthew chapter 16.
[time=2090] While you're finding your way there, I'd like to establish the context. In verses 13 through 20, Jesus reveals the church.
[time=2102] He says to his disciples in a reflective setting, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man am?"
[time=2111] And they said, "Some say that you're Elijah, others say you're Jeremiah, are one of the prophets. Some say that you're John the Baptist come back to life."
[time=2120] And then Jesus turned their attention away from public sentiment. He said, "But who do you say that I am?"
[time=2127] And Peter, the impetuous, but prudent one spoke up and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[time=2136] And Jesus confirmed that. He said, "Blessed are you, Simon, Son of John, for no man has revealed this to you but my Father who is in heaven.
[time=2145] And thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church. And the gates of hell will not prevail against it."
[time=2158] They had never heard that before. Not only had they never heard that word, they had never heard what the church was, but Jesus is now for the first time revealing the church.
[time=2170] And then in verses 21 through 23, he reveals the cross. They've never heard that before either.
[time=2181] From that time on, from the time he revealed the church, the Bible says he began to tell them how he must go to Jerusalem,
[time=2189] "Suffer many things at the hands of the chief priests and the elders and die and rise again."
[time=2197] Well, again, it's impetuous Peter, but not so prudent this time. He said, "Oh, no, you won't. It'll never be, Lord."
[time=2204] Implying, "I won't let it happen." And Christ corrects him and says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[time=2213] That was something that had never entered their mind before, a church. This was something that never entered their mind before, a cross.
[time=2221] He's Messiah. We're trying to find the biggest and the strongest horse imaginable, white like silver. We're going to charge into the city. We're going to take over the cross.
[time=2233] Never heard that before. Then in verses 24 through 28, he reveals the commitment of a disciple who is to be a part of the church and follow the cross.
[time=2248] Verse 24, "Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.'
[time=2267] For whoever wants to save his life will lose it. But whoever loses his life, for me, will find it."
[time=2280] What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give an exchange for his soul?
[time=2292] For the son of man is going to come in his father's glory with angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.
[time=2301] I tell you the truth. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom.
[time=2313] In this passage, Jesus has drawn their attention to three new things. The revelation of the church, the revelation of the cross, and the revelation of the commitment that he's going to demand of them and us, anyone who would be his disciple.
[time=2332] First of all, under this commitment, he gives us the requirements of being a disciple. Here's the requirement. Three of them to be a disciple of Christ.
[time=2343] You see, the word "disciple" has a deep meaning. We can come to Christ and stagnate and fail to grow. It's tragic. It's inappropriate, and really it's unexcusable.
[time=2358] Jesus said these words in John chapter 9, "If you are my disciple indeed." Someone has made a sharp distinction that Jesus has some sheep and some disciples.
[time=2372] Sheep are those who've come to him. They've got his brand, but they're wanderers. They're unproductive.
[time=2380] Disciples, our students, our followers, who are committed. He says, "For this church to happen, it's going to take commitment." And here are the three requirements.
[time=2393] One, that you deny yourself. I think we best understand that word "self" to mean we deny our old sinful nature, that when we receive Christ as Savior, he comes into our heart and he begins changing us.
[time=2409] The problem is, the new man by the Spirit of Christ is fighting the old man, the Spirit of sin, and the two do battle, and we have to deny starve the old man.
[time=2425] The word "deny" is the same word that Jesus used in Matthew 26 when he said, "Peter, you're bold and you're proud." And I tell you this, Peter, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
[time=2440] Deny. And then Peter said, one pointed out in the crowd, "You know him." He said, "I never knew him." He denied.
[time=2452] This verse is saying that we are so followers of Christ that when an old nature said, "Hey, it's me. I want." We say, "I don't know you."
[time=2465] When our appetites say, "What I'd really like is," we say, "Don't know you." We deny ourselves.
[time=2474] The second thing that we do is we deliberately take up our cross. The cross has become almost glamorized and romanticized.
[time=2484] We picture it as beautiful and splendorous and marvelous. It was not. It was the instrument of agonizing death.
[time=2495] One of his story and estimates that in the lifetime of the disciples, they saw 30,000 crucifixions in Jerusalem alone.
[time=2505] When Jesus said the word cross, it was like saying, "If any man will come after me," he takes up his gas chamber.
[time=2512] He straps himself into the electric chair. He takes the lethal injection. He dies to himself.
[time=2522] In the Church of Jesus Christ today, we have so romanticized the cross that it's now just a trinket, a piece of jewelry.
[time=2531] We've lost understanding that it was Christ who died there. The lady went to a jewelry store and peered into the showcase and said,
[time=2540] "I'd like to buy a cross." "Oh, we have lovely crosses here," said the jeweler. What would you like? A gold one or a silver one?
[time=2548] "Well, I think I'd like a gold one," responded the lady. "Good choice," said the jeweler.
[time=2553] "Do you want one that's playing our one with that little man on it?" You see, we have so lost our fire, so lost our commitment that the world in which we live no longer knows that it was Jesus who died on that cross.
[time=2573] It's just a trinket. It's just a subtle piece of jewelry. We don't know him because his disciples haven't died for him, haven't died to self.
[time=2588] The third requirement of being a disciple is this, daily following him. The word daily doesn't occur here in Matthew, but Luke gives us the same event and adds that adverb for us.
[time=2604] The Greek tense being present says this way, "Start and continually follow me."
[time=2613] The walk with Christ is not a burst of enthusiasm. It's not getting all excited at the end of a Billy Graham crusade, nor is it getting fired up at the end of an emotional song.
[time=2623] It's living out the daily grind in obedience to Christ. It's following him, sometimes when the following is alone.
[time=2631] There is an old invitation to him, "I love." He goes like this, "I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.
[time=2647] I have decided to follow Jesus, though no one joined me, still I will follow, though no one joined me, still I will follow.
[time=2658] I have decided to follow Jesus, the world behind me, the cross before me."
[time=2666] The blight on the Church of Jesus Christ today is not that they are empty. They're often filled to overflowing, but filled with people whose commitment to their church and the ministry is casual.
[time=2686] Allow me to share with you some statistics, some from our Church, some from national records. Here's a statistic from our Church.
[time=2695] Approximately 55% of the people who call "Black Hawk Home" do nothing other than attend a morning worship service.
[time=2706] That is, they don't go to Sunday night, they don't go to Wednesday night, they don't work in the nursery, they don't usher, they do not join evangelism explosion, they don't sing in the choir, they don't cheat Sunday school.
[time=2715] They come and sit. 55% of the people, more than half, do nothing in our Church, and that 55% who does nothing in our Church, but sit, they only sit 25% of the time.
[time=2731] And I don't mean they stand, they just don't even come. On a given Sunday, half of the people who call "Black Hawk Home" are not even here at home.
[time=2745] Oh, we all take vacations, I hope you have a great one. We all occasionally need to go see Grandma, have a great time. But 26, 30 Sundays a year, we're not even willing to come.
[time=2762] A second statistic to share with you. Of those who are enrolled in adult Bible fellowship, our adult Sunday morning Sunday school, less than half, 48% are here on the average Sunday.
[time=2781] Now, some Baptist churches are not real good at record keeping. There was a ship that wrecked on an abandoned island with 7 people. One of them was a Baptist pastor. When Sunday came, he held Church and turned in an attendance of 10.
[time=2796] We're not one of those type of churches. We keep good, accurate roles. I went through the roles of about half of the adult Bible fellowship to make sure they were current.
[time=2808] The other Baptist churches, the only way you can get off their mailing list is to die and send a self-addressed stamp envelope with your new address.
[time=2818] We're not one of those churches. Our role is current. And on a good Sunday, not Mother's Day, not Memorial Day, not Labor Day, not the Fourth of July, not Thanksgiving, not a snow Sunday, not a hot Sunday, not a Christmas Sunday, not a New Year Sunday, not a Valentine Sunday, just a plain regular good Sunday.
[time=2837] On a good Sunday, 48% of our people who are enrolled go to Sunday school. Another statistic to share with you. This is not from our church. Maybe we're a little better. This is a national statistic that 95% of us who say, "I accept that Jesus Christ is my personal Savior.
[time=2861] I believe He is the only way to heaven. I believe that if you don't receive Him, you'll spend eternity in hell. Never tell another soul that."
[time=2873] 95% of us say, "I've received Christ. I believe He is my only way to heaven. I believe He is your only way to heaven, but I'm not going to tell you."
[time=2883] 95% of all Christians never bring another person to the saving knowledge of Christ.
[time=2891] And that doesn't mean you have to sit down with them and say, "Allow me to explain to you the difference between sub-lapsarianism, infra-lapsarianism, and a golden Labrador Retriever."
[time=2902] You don't have to know deep theology. You may just be able to take a track out of your pocket and say, "You know, I sense that you're interested in some of this.
[time=2911] Take this and read it, it'll tell you how you can know Jesus." One of the best ways you can share Christ with somebody is simply say this, "Would you like to come to church with me on Sunday?"
[time=2922] But 95% of us will never bring another person to Christ.
[time=2927] Another statistic with you, this is a national statistic, that 80% of all money given to Christian ministry is given by 20% of the people.
[time=2939] Now I want to proudly announce to you that our church is far better than that.
[time=2944] Because 80% of our money doesn't come from the meager 20%, it comes from a whopping 22%.
[time=2952] And our instincts say, "Well, that's the rich people." We don't go and say, "Well, who gave how much? I don't know who gives how much." But we know that it's not the wealthy people, it's the Pew people, it's the mainline people, it's the trench people that give to the Lord's work.
[time=2974] Whenever we talk about giving it often irritates people, somebody gave me this analogy.
[time=2979] When you go to the doctor, you say, "Doctor, I've got a pain in my abdomen." One of the first things he'll do is he'll poke. He may poke right here and he'll say, "Is that word hurts?" He'll say, "Well, it's tender there, but that's not really where it hurts." He'll say, "Well, I don't think it's your goal bladder then." Then he'll poke right here and he says, "That word hurts." He'll say, "No, that's not it." He'll say, "Well, I don't think it's how you don't hurt me then." Then he drops on and he goes here and you go, "Oh!" He'll say, "Let me push down lightly." When he releases the rebound, makes you scream, he says, "It's your appendix." And the doctor knows by where he pokes, if it's hurt, that's where you've got the problem.
[time=3016] Somebody said, "If that's where the message pokes and you hurt, that's where you've got the problem."
[time=3026] Allow me to answer five questions that are often thrown at me about money.
[time=3032] One question that's often thrown about me is this.
[time=3036] Rick, I believe everybody ought to give.
[time=3039] Is it all right if I give when the Lord leads me?
[time=3044] The answer is absolutely yes if the Lord leads you through his word.
[time=3051] Because his word says that we give regularly to the Lord.
[time=3056] If you mean by the Lord leading you when you are overcome with an emotion that makes you sensitive, that's not a real good idea.
[time=3065] Now, that type of thing works.
[time=3067] I noticed we have a little file at home that we keep all of our accounts payable and when the bill comes, we stick it right there.
[time=3074] When we get paid every two weeks, we draw it out of there.
[time=3077] We wisely have a red file for those bills.
[time=3081] And I opened it up and I noticed that we were giving to a ministry across the country.
[time=3086] I didn't know that.
[time=3088] I said, "When did we start doing that?" Well, I saw this program, so that's great.
[time=3093] I noticed we were giving to the Philharmonic. I said, "When did we do that?" Well, I read this letter.
[time=3098] That's good.
[time=3099] And then I saw we were given to private TV.
[time=3102] When did we start that?
[time=3103] All this other junk was on.
[time=3105] That was only a good show one day and they asked for money.
[time=3107] So that's all fine.
[time=3109] But you know what?
[time=3110] There will always be somebody who will say, "Got your number today." That's not how you give to the Lord because somebody got your number today.
[time=3119] Because somebody created an emotion and you give out of emotion.
[time=3124] We give as the Lord leads us through His Word, which says we're to give regularly.
[time=3129] A second question people often say to me is this.
[time=3133] I'll start giving when I get squared away financially.
[time=3137] Is that okay?
[time=3140] My answer to them is probably you're not giving is the reason why you're not squared away financially.
[time=3148] We were studying hagi-eye last week, never intending it to become a thesis on giving.
[time=3155] What a powerful book of the Bible it is on giving.
[time=3158] It shares at least these three principles.
[time=3160] Principle number one is God owns everything anyway.
[time=3163] I think I own things, but the proof of it is, die.
[time=3170] Have you ever seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul trailer?
[time=3176] We'll nothing, we're just temporary proprietors.
[time=3181] In hagi-eye two-eight God says the gold is mine and the silver is mine.
[time=3185] All that we have to begin with is already God.
[time=3188] In chapter one verses two through four he talks the priority of giving to the Lord before we take care of our own prosperity.
[time=3199] And then in verses five through eight he tells them that their financial house is out of order because of their failure to honor the Lord first.
[time=3209] Listen to these words.
[time=3210] Now this is what the Lord Almighty says, give careful thought to your ways.
[time=3214] You've planted much but harvested little.
[time=3218] You eat but never have enough.
[time=3221] You drink but never have your fill.
[time=3224] You earn wages only to put them in a purse with holes.
[time=3228] Isn't that a poetic way of talking about inflation?
[time=3231] You put it in a purse that has holes.
[time=3234] This is what the Lord Almighty says, give careful attention to your ways.
[time=3240] Go up to the mountains and bring down timber and build my house so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored says the Lord.
[time=3247] You expected much but see it turned out to be little.
[time=3254] You brought home but I blew it away.
[time=3263] Why?
[time=3264] Because my house which remains are ruined while each of you is busy with his own house.
[time=3273] The point of Haggai's message is that we honor the Lord first before we honor ourselves.
[time=3280] A third question that I am often asked is well how often should I give?
[time=3285] In 1 Corinthians chapter 16 it says on the first day of the week let each one of you give as goddess prospered him.
[time=3293] In those days people were paid daily.
[time=3296] They saved it up throughout the week and they gave it on Sunday.
[time=3299] In our society some people are paid weekly.
[time=3302] Others of us are paid biweekly, some monthly, some on commission.
[time=3307] I think the point of the passage is not that it has to be weekly but that it is regularly.
[time=3312] A systematic plan of giving.
[time=3315] Then this question, where should I give?
[time=3319] I'd like to answer that in two ways. First of all I think we ought to give to the Lord's work.
[time=3324] I don't mean by that give every penny that you're ever going to give to Blackhawk.
[time=3329] Absolutely not.
[time=3331] I believe if you want to support missionaries directly I encourage that.
[time=3336] If you want to get in CBMC please do it's a great outreach.
[time=3340] If you want to support campus life and campus crusade there are excellent ministries do it.
[time=3346] Maybe you befriended one of our pastor friends in Jamaica and you're sending them a little money on the side.
[time=3352] That's great.
[time=3354] Just give it to the Lord's work.
[time=3357] And then secondly I'd like to answer it by we ought to give it to the Lord's work where we're getting our ministry from the Lord.
[time=3366] I believe it's good to be generous everywhere but if you're in CBMC and that's how you came to Christ and that's how you're being discipled and that's where your ministry is your treasure ought to be there too.
[time=3375] And if Blackhawk's your home then your treasure ought to be there.
[time=3379] We're not trying to use the Bible hour this morning to reach into the homes of people and say support this church.
[time=3386] We don't want that.
[time=3388] We want you to support your church if you're watching by way of television.
[time=3392] But you ought to support the Lord's work where the Lord is ministering to you.
[time=3398] The final question about money that I'm often asked is this one.
[time=3403] How much do I have to give?
[time=3407] Well there's a lot of different ways of answering that one.
[time=3411] Somebody said the issue is not how much do I give but how much do I keep?
[time=3415] In the Old Testament they gave a tithe.
[time=3418] Actually they gave several tithes.
[time=3420] A tithe refers to 10%.
[time=3423] There are those that teach that that's Old Testament and that's New Testament.
[time=3426] I understand their point.
[time=3428] I don't believe that's true.
[time=3430] I believe in the New Testament we give out of grace.
[time=3433] Some say grace demands more than the law.
[time=3436] That may be.
[time=3437] Others say well the tithe of the Old Testament is just an example and I choose to follow that example.
[time=3442] I think that's marvelous if you choose to do that.
[time=3445] Just don't make it a law for somebody else.
[time=3447] But I believe we're to give regularly and sacrificially and generously.
[time=3452] If you need a benchmark that usually helps.
[time=3456] The Old Testament was a tithe.
[time=3459] The New Testament it's grace.
[time=3462] My suggestion is that you begin giving regularly before you begin giving abundantly.
[time=3469] Many of us have all of a sudden come to grips with what God says about giving.
[time=3473] We say oh I better do something and so we give a very generous amount amount that we really can't substantially handle.
[time=3480] And then when the next time to give comes we say I can't do it and we quit.
[time=3484] It'd be better to give a little systematically and regularly.
[time=3514] [MUSIC]
[time=3522] It's been our privilege today to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir.
[time=3527] Mirror and soloist Sam Hepler and Kim Johnson.
[time=3531] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3534] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior.
[time=3539] Just before we close I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3542] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3544] Dear Heavenly Father I come to you today knowing that I have a need for you to come into my heart.
[time=3551] I ask you to come in today and cleanse me of the sins that I've committed and forgive me and make my life new.
[time=3559] In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=3563] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3567] And then when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet on lessons of assurance that will help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
