[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] We have everything from an instant copy to instant coffee.
[time=125] And yet, it lulls us to sleep to think that spiritual growth is instant.
[time=130] And we are not committed to learning God's word.
[time=134] Someone in a humorous way looked back and said, "What if when Jesus gave the Sermon on the Mount, "Peter raised his hand and said, "Lord, do we have to write this down?" Thomas said, "I don't have any paper." John said, "The other disciples didn't have to learn this." James responded, "Are we gonna have a test on this?" Judah said, "What's this have to do with real life?" (dramatic music)
[time=175] - Welcome to an hour of Bible Study, Music, and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=180] Thank you for joining us.
[time=181] Rick's message today is entitled, "Remembering a Remedy for the Future." We live in an instant society.
[time=188] We have fast food restaurants and diets that promise fast results.
[time=192] We have instant credit and drive-through loan applications to pay off our instant credit.
[time=198] Last year's pain reliever promised fast, fast relief.
[time=201] This year it assures us of fast, fast, fastest relief.
[time=205] We have come to believe that everything in life is instant.
[time=209] However, spiritual maturity is neither instant nor effort lives.
[time=213] Today, Rick ends his series of messages on Christianity at the close of the 20th century with a challenge to recommit our lives to the pursuit of spiritual maturity in the future.
[time=223] Today's message is titled, "Remembering the Remedy for the Future." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=233] Rick's text is taken from the book of Joshua, chapter four.
[time=236] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=240] A group from Black Hawk Christian School will perform a choral reading.
[time=245] And there will be special music from the handbell choir and Keith Prodigal.
[time=252] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=262] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=265] Now here's Rick.
[time=268] - We also wanna welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=273] We trust today that as we worship together, God will strengthen your life, your faith in Jesus Christ, and that you'll know that in Christ there's power.
[time=282] There is power in the blood of the Lamb.
[time=285] Jesus Christ who gave his life for us and has the power not only to forgive sins, but to give us power to live for him today.
[time=294] Our choir sings of that theme.
[time=296] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 251 seconds]
[time=557] (audience applauding)
[time=564] - Wonderworking power in the blood of the Lamb able to save us from our deepest sin.
[time=572] We can indeed have victory through Jesus Christ, Him number 473.
[time=577] We're going to sing the first and second stanzas of that great victorious hymn, "Victory in Jesus," verses one and two.
[time=585] (lively orchestral music) [MUSIC - 81 seconds]
[time=673] (lively orchestral music) [MUSIC - 52 seconds]
[time=733] - Thank you very much for singing today.
[time=737] We do appreciate that.
[time=739] Our scripture today will be in the form of a choral reading from students from Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=744] - If therefore, there's any encouragement in Christ,
[time=750] if there is any consolation of love.
[time=752] - If there is any fellowship of the spirit.
[time=755] - If any affection and compassion.
[time=756] - Make my joy complete.
[time=758] - By being of the same mind.
[time=761] - Maintaining the same love.
[time=763] - United in spirit.
[time=765] - Intent on one purpose.
[time=767] - Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[time=770] - But with humility of mind.
[time=772] - Let each of you regard one another as more important than himself.
[time=777] - Do not merely look out for your own personal interest.
[time=780] - But also for the interests of others.
[time=783] Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus.
[time=788] Who, although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[time=796] But empty in himself.
[time=797] - Taking the form of a bondservant.
[time=799] - And being made in the lightness of men.
[time=802] - And being found in appearance as a man.
[time=804] - He humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death.
[time=808] - Even death on a cross.
[time=810] - Therefore also God highly exalted him.
[time=813] - And bestowed on him the name, which is above every name.
[time=817] - And that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow.
[time=820] - Of those who are in heaven and on earth.
[time=823] - And under the earth.
[time=825] - And all tongue should confess.
[time=827] - That Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=829] - She's the glory of God, the Father.
[time=831] - It's a beautiful Memorial Day weekend here in Fort Wayne.
[time=841] I know that you're watching this a week or two delayed, so we'll simply say we hope you had a beautiful Memorial Day.
[time=848] Pete, you have some special plans for your family.
[time=850] - The family's gonna get together tomorrow for a picnic, and we're gonna have a kind of a relaxed day.
[time=855] - All that's great, that's just great.
[time=857] - You're heading out a little farther than just the park.
[time=860] - A little further, we'll probably make it to Florida by tomorrow morning.
[time=863] - Oh, that's great, I hope you have a good vacation.
[time=866] - We will, no doubt.
[time=868] Starting this week is our summer Bible conference.
[time=871] This is our last opportunity to invite you to a film titled, "A Man Called Norman." It will air here at Black Hawk in our new worship center on Wednesday night, June the 7th.
[time=883] This is a high impact film.
[time=885] Some of you no doubt have heard about this story from Jim Dobson in his ministry, Focus on the Family.
[time=891] The summer Bible conference starts with a film, a man called Norman on June the 7th at seven o'clock, and we want to invite you to come.
[time=900] It will continue through the month of June, June the 14th, Pastor Ivan French will be here.
[time=906] He was at our summer Bible conference before, and was so well received, we wanted to have him back.
[time=912] And a new speaker this year is Dr. Carl Solvine.
[time=916] Carl has been teaching my wife, Kathy, in a class at Fort Wayne Bible College on counseling, and every week she comes home and says, "Dr. Solvine said this, did you know that he said that?" And I've learned secondhand much from him, and we're looking forward to him being here Wednesday, June the 21st.
[time=932] And then our summer Bible conference will conclude with Dr. Bruce Dunn from Peoria, Illinois.
[time=937] He has a great radio ministry, a fine Bible teacher on June the 28th.
[time=943] So please join us beginning this Sunday, June the 7th, excuse me, this Wednesday, June the 7th for the summer Bible conference.
[time=951] And then just as that ends, the patriotic panoramas upon us.
[time=954] - Yes, following closely on the heels of our last summer Bible conference is our annual patriotic panorama.
[time=959] It will be held July 2nd.
[time=961] At four o'clock in the afternoon here at the worship center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=966] And Rick, we're looking forward to the choir singing some great patriotic songs, some special events honoring the presidents of the United States and special guests.
[time=975] The sounds alive will be with us.
[time=976] So I hope that you all can set that time aside and join us for that special day, July 2nd at four p.m.
[time=984] - You're announcing that is a good lead into the morning message because we're gonna be talking about the value of remembering.
[time=991] Our country just didn't happen.
[time=993] Men and women forged this country on the hard anvil of war enough battle.
[time=998] And we want to honor our heritage and looking forward to that.
[time=1002] - It's always good to remember our country and remember those that did fight in wars throughout the years.
[time=1007] I have a dear friend who was killed in the Vietnam War, but thankful to know that he knew Jesus Christ is his personal savior.
[time=1016] - Well, we do want to invite you to honor God by honoring this great country with which he has blessed us for the patriotic panorama.
[time=1025] This morning we have a booklet to share with you for our final time.
[time=1028] It has the simple one word title, money.
[time=1031] I don't know of a word that gets our attention any better than that word.
[time=1036] All of us have some concern with money no matter how heavenly minded we are.
[time=1041] This booklet helps us to get a heavenly perspective on an earthly commodity.
[time=1046] Money is neither bad nor good.
[time=1048] The Bible did not say money is the root of all evil.
[time=1051] It says that the love of money is the root of all evil.
[time=1056] In many ways we misunderstood the scripture and often have misunderstood life.
[time=1061] We want to share this booklet with you.
[time=1063] Simply write to us and we'll send you your copy.
[time=1066] - You can receive the booklet called Money by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1077] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1085] Often we receive letters from you, our viewers, and they're always encouraging to us.
[time=1092] We received this letter just about a week ago from a viewer in California who spoke so highly of all the ministry.
[time=1099] He says greeting in Jesus' name.
[time=1101] It's our good pleasure to listen to your TV program here in California on TV, 64, K-F-T-L, San Leandro, California.
[time=1111] We look forward with great anticipation to seeing you each week.
[time=1115] Then Pete, this viewer goes on to speak so highly of me, but particularly of you.
[time=1119] And he was so impressed with the ministry of music.
[time=1122] And then I turned the letter over and it was signed with sincerity in Christ, Peter and Florence Coby.
[time=1128] Do you know those people?
[time=1129] - Yeah, I know them quite well.
[time=1130] They know me very well.
[time=1132] And I suppose they're quite responsible for all of my education from the early days right up through college because financially they helped me out and encouraged me in music and it happens to be my mom and dad.
[time=1143] I can't imagine them writing.
[time=1145] - Oh, I can, but they were so kind to tell us of friends of theirs who regularly watch the Bible hour.
[time=1150] So we wanna say hello to our California friends.
[time=1153] And then on a more serious note, we received this letter from a Fort Wayne viewer.
[time=1157] The last few years have been many years of struggle through divorce and hard times and surviving the most recent struggle, the loss of my mother with cancer three months ago.
[time=1170] I have had a hard time accepting this last loss and wondering why all these situations always happen to me.
[time=1179] The message on Sunday touched my heart to realize that I need to be thankful for what the Lord has given me in the love of my children and the loving memories of my mother.
[time=1190] Not for what?
[time=1191] I have lost.
[time=1193] I've started watching the Bible hour in the past few weeks and have felt so much closer to God.
[time=1200] Well, we certainly hope the Bible hour is strengthening your faith in Jesus Christ and do want to encourage you to write.
[time=1206] We'd love to know if you've received Christ as your savior or made a significant spiritual decision.
[time=1211] We'd also like to offer you the booklet once again.
[time=1214] Before we go back to our morning worship service, Pete, would you share that address one final time?
[time=1219] - Yes, it's a great encouragement for us and we knew right.
[time=1222] And so we encourage you to write today to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1232] (upbeat music)
[time=1441] (applause)
[time=1447] - Thank you, Bell.
[time=1449] Choir, my country, Tiz of the and God of our fathers.
[time=1453] Two excellent themes for us to hear on this Memorial Day weekend.
[time=1457] We have a debt of gratitude to our country for the privileges we have of freedom, the opportunity to assemble in the worship today and an even greater debt, of course, to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for freedom from sin and pardon from all guilt.
[time=1475] It was on May the 5th, 1868 that John Logan, then commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, declared May the 30th of that year to be, "A day for decorating the graves of our comrades who gave their lives in defense of their country during the recent rebellion." It was after World War I that this date was set aside for honoring the soldiers who gave their lives in all of the wars of U.S. history.
[time=1505] And so we assemble here today to worship Jesus Christ, but also to thank Him for our country and to pray for our nation.
[time=1513] Kathy and I had the privilege of attending a musical called "Lame Miserable" with some friends.
[time=1518] In that story, a Victor Hugo put the music as a song from the perspective of a man who sees a young man, a son, going off to war.
[time=1530] And the prayer of his heart is that God would bring him home.
[time=1534] Today on Memorial Day, we remember those who did not come home, and we pray that the sons who serve our land now, God would bring them home.
[time=1545] Would you pray with me?
[time=1546] Our God and Father, we bow before you.
[time=1549] We want to thank you for this country, for the freedom that we know, the prosperity with which you have bestowed.
[time=1556] We are richly blessed in every way, and we give you thanks.
[time=1561] And we thank you for the sacrifice of men and women who have gone before us, who have given their lives that we might know the freedom of religion, the freedom of assembly, the freedom of speech.
[time=1576] We thank you for the security that our borders are safe, there are no police here today other than friends.
[time=1583] There are no guards at our doors, there are no restrictions on the length of our meeting or what we say.
[time=1590] We thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ, that our heart has been unshackled, our sins have been forgiven, and those of us who know the sons are indeed free.
[time=1601] We would pray today that as we meet that you would meet with us, that you would give comfort to those who have lost loved ones in recent days, for Virginia Kelly and Dick, and the loss of Virgil.
[time=1614] We'd pray for Bessie Blakely's family and Katie Tustacens, for those who today is a grim reminder of losses, a year ago, the delves and the wagners.
[time=1627] For each one who today will feel the sting of death as they remember.
[time=1632] We would pray today that your hand would be upon the ballast as they serve you in Manila in that hot spot of the globe, and the balls as their ambassadors for Christ in Panama.
[time=1646] We pray for our soldiers and our sailors who are today keeping our freedom by serving you.
[time=1653] We pray that you would keep them.
[time=1656] Recent disasters have caused us to think and to hurt for those who have died, and we would pray this morning your hand would be upon each of our sailors and each of our soldiers, each of the men and women who defend our country.
[time=1675] We pray that you would protect and be with Paul McIntosh and each son in our prayer today, even as we have learned his O Lord Jesus, bring them home.
[time=1695] O Lord,
[time=1702] in my care,
[time=1711] in my need,
[time=1718] you have always been proud.
[time=1724] He is yours.
[time=1733] He is afraid.
[time=1740] Let him rest.
[time=1754] Bring him home.
[time=1774] He is like the son I might have known.
[time=1780] If God had granted his son, the son was died one by one.
[time=1791] How son they fly on and on,
[time=1799] and I am old, and will be gone.
[time=1816] Bring him home.
[time=1833] He is yours.
[time=1838] He is only a woman.
[time=1845] You can take.
[time=1852] You can give.
[time=1859] Let him be.
[time=1865] Let him live.
[time=1872] If I die,
[time=1878] let me die.
[time=1884] Let him live.
[time=1891] Bring him home.
[time=1918] Thank you, Keith.
[time=1925] The reminder in song that the freedom that we possessed was forged out on the anvil of the battlefield,
[time=1933] and by the lives of men and women who have fought for us.
[time=1937] God, again, we stop to thank you for our country and for the cross, for freedom militarily and politically, and for freedoms spiritually.
[time=1947] Now as we study your word, we would pray that you would put us in remembrance of our heritage.
[time=1954] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1959] In Joshua chapter 4, there are 12 stones of remembrance.
[time=1965] If you have a Bible, I invite you to follow along.
[time=1968] I would like to read all about the first seven verses of Joshua chapter 4 for you.
[time=1975] Joshua 4-1, when the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan,
[time=1981] the Lord said to Joshua, "Choose 12 men from among the people, one from each tribe,
[time=1990] and tell them to take up 12 stones from the middle of the Jordan, from right where the priests stood, and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you will stay tonight." Joshua called together the 12 men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, and he said to them, "Go over before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan.
[time=2019] Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, to serve as a sign among you.
[time=2031] In the future, when your children ask you, what do these stones mean?
[time=2037] Tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off
[time=2043] before the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
[time=2046] When it passed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.
[time=2051] These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.
[time=2059] 12 stones of remembrance.
[time=2063] This was a new generation.
[time=2065] A generation ago, God had done something similar for this nation.
[time=2070] Under the leadership of Moses, God had brought them out of Egypt, and they walked out victorious, and then a reluctant Pharaoh reversed his decision.
[time=2082] And now they were pinned in by the Red Sea at their backs, and the thunderous cloud of dust stirred up by the horses and the chariots of Pharaoh's approaching army.
[time=2094] And disasters seemed to be endoment as they would be crushed between two unmovable enemies.
[time=2102] And then God miraculously opened up the Red Sea.
[time=2106] Moses and the children of Israel crossed through on dry land, and the walls canopled it down, destroying Pharaoh's army.
[time=2117] That was 40 years ago.
[time=2120] That generation had all died off, and this was a new generation.
[time=2125] They had not experienced the crossing of the Red Sea.
[time=2129] They had not experienced Moses' dynamic leadership.
[time=2133] This was a new leader, Joshua.
[time=2136] But God had given to Joshua this solitary promise, "As I was with Moses, so shall I be with you." And then he performed a miracle just like the miracle of the Red Sea.
[time=2152] This time the waters of the Jordan River were miraculously stopped,
[time=2158] and again the children of Israel passed through.
[time=2162] No doubt a bit marveled and a bit frightened.
[time=2168] To think of crossing through a river that was there and seeing a wall of water next to you, that was not a time to stroll.
[time=2176] That was a time to run through.
[time=2180] The whole nation had made it safely through before that wall had collapsed.
[time=2184] It was still standing there, and the ark and the priests were still in the middle.
[time=2190] And Joshua said, "12 of you.
[time=2193] You.
[time=2195] You from Gad.
[time=2196] You from Ruben.
[time=2197] You from Benjamin.
[time=2198] You from Judah." There are a couple, each of you 12, go back into the river.
[time=2205] Back into the river.
[time=2207] And I want you to pick out a stone and bring it out.
[time=2212] Pick out a stone, he says.
[time=2215] That's all there is in this country, is stones.
[time=2219] The mountains are stone, and the hills are stone, and you can't even run a plow through the valleys.
[time=2224] It's stone.
[time=2225] He says, "Pick out a stone." He bent down to pick out a stone, and not that stone.
[time=2234] This size stone.
[time=2235] And Joshua would make them pick up a stone so big that they had to put their shoulder under it to move it.
[time=2242] And they said, "Bring those stones over here, and 12 men carried stones as big as they could
[time=2248] to manage." He said, "Now put one here, and put the other one next to it.
[time=2253] Maybe a third one there." And now you three, build yours on top, and then finally three stones were
[time=2261] placed on three stones, and then three more, and then two, and then two more until
[time=2268] 12 stones were stacked up there.
[time=2272] There was no Michelangelo to sculpt that into a statue of David.
[time=2277] Just 12 stones.
[time=2282] Yet remarkably different stones.
[time=2287] All of these stones were rough and jagged, porous.
[time=2295] But these stones were smooth, almost polished by the decades, the centuries,
[time=2302] the millennia of the waters of the Jordan rushing around them, smoothing them,
[time=2308] polishing them.
[time=2309] And they stood in absolute contrast to all of the other stones.
[time=2316] But why 12 stones?
[time=2320] 12 stones, because just as this generation didn't know about the crossing of the Red Sea, the next generation would not know the crossing of the Jordan.
[time=2329] And Joshua said, "We'll take these stones and put them in our camp at Gilgal."
[time=2337] And then when our children come by and they say, "What does that mean?" We'll say, "The Lord our God stopped the rivers of the Jordan, and we walked through on dry land." The stones of remembrance became a memorial to a nation that their guide could both provide and protect.
[time=2362] Out of those 12 stones, I believe there are three very practical lessons
[time=2368] we need to learn today on our memorial day weekend.
[time=2372] From these stones of remembrance, I'd like to suggest, first of all, we learn that it's important to remember the past.
[time=2382] It's important to remember the past.
[time=2386] Those stones were put there so that generation after generation could bring their children, they could point to the past, and a nation could learn of a God who could both provide and protect, even against the elements of nature.
[time=2403] Some of you have been at Black Hawk long enough that you know history is one of my academic loves.
[time=2409] It was third, right behind recess and gym.
[time=2414] You may not be as fond of history as I am.
[time=2418] A young boy didn't like his history, booked all that well, and he wrote inside the cover, "In case of fire, throw this book in first."
[time=2427] You may not be a lover of history, but would you learn just a little history with me today?
[time=2433] Those stones were there as a reminder of a living history lesson of what God had done.
[time=2440] We failed to learn the lessons of history.
[time=2444] A man by the name of Hegel is famous for his dialectical process of thinking was taken over by Marx and became dialectical materialism.
[time=2454] But Hegel also made this insightful statement about history.
[time=2458] He said, "What experience in history teach us is this, that experience in history have taught us nothing, that people in government have never learned anything from history or have acted upon the principles deduced from it." Cicero put it more simply when he said, "He who does not learn history is forever a child." Will and Ariel Durand speaking of our generation said, "We are the most informed people in the world as to the history of the last 24 hours, and we know nothing of the history before it." One man said that he who does not learn the lessons of history is doomed to repeat its mistakes.
[time=2507] How true.
[time=2509] Two hundred years ago, 1788, a man by the name of Edward Gibbon wrote a classic called "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." Now as you listen to his five explanations for "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," remember this is 200 years ago.
[time=2532] This is history.
[time=2534] This is not philosophy about today but history.
[time=2537] Here are his five explanations for the fall of Rome.
[time=2542] One, an undermining of the dignity and the sanctity of the whole,
[time=2548] which is the basis for human society.
[time=2553] Two, higher and higher taxes
[time=2559] and spending of public money for free bread and circuses for the populace.
[time=2567] Three, a mad craze for pleasure with pastimes becoming more exciting,
[time=2577] more brutal and more immoral.
[time=2583] Four, the building of great armaments of war, although the real enemy was within.
[time=2592] The decay of individual responsibility.
[time=2597] Five, the decay of religion.
[time=2603] Faith fading into mere form, losing touch with life and losing power to guide the people.
[time=2614] This isn't a man talking about our rated movies that feature brutality in the theaters of our day.
[time=2621] It's not talking about an astronomical budget that has gone beyond the billions and the trillions of a country that's giving everybody the dull.
[time=2630] It's not talking about the liberalization of American churches in the 20th century.
[time=2635] It's not talking about the rise of abortion and the decline of the nuclear family in the 20th century.
[time=2642] This is a review 200 years old of an empire that died 1500 years ago.
[time=2652] That's history.
[time=2656] And 12 stones were stacked side by side
[time=2662] so that generations would know their history.
[time=2666] You see, Israel was a nation like every other nation.
[time=2669] They were prone to forget.
[time=2672] God had taken them out of slavery in Egypt and brought them to the Promised Land.
[time=2677] And in his bringing, when they were thirsty, God gave them water from Iraq.
[time=2682] When they were hungry, God gave them manna from heaven.
[time=2685] And you know one day they said, I'm tired of manna.
[time=2690] I'm tired of this plain bland, what is it?
[time=2696] I want some real food.
[time=2699] I want some meat.
[time=2702] And they got upset and said, I'd rather go back to Egypt.
[time=2707] I remember the leaks in the garlic we had back in Egypt.
[time=2711] Those were the good old days.
[time=2715] The good old days, those were slavery.
[time=2719] And you see, when you don't know your history, you don't know your past.
[time=2725] And here were 12 stones to give them a history lesson that God could both provide and protect for his people.
[time=2734] There's a history lesson that Jesus wants us to learn.
[time=2739] On the night before he was betrayed, Jesus went to a private room just as disciples were invited.
[time=2746] He took bread and took a cup, and common commodities of the meal of that day.
[time=2752] But he said something so in common.
[time=2755] Holding the bread up, he said, this bread is my body, which is broken for you.
[time=2765] Then he took the cup, the red wine, perhaps he let a little spill out of the chalice so they would see it.
[time=2773] He said, this wine is my blood, which is shed for you.
[time=2779] And then he spoke these words.
[time=2781] This do in remembrance of me.
[time=2787] You see, when we come to that communion table, those are our remembrances.
[time=2794] It is our living history lesson.
[time=2798] That's why our evening service tonight is so important because as we hold that bread, and as we hold that cup, God's trying to teach us a history lesson.
[time=2809] Jesus said, this do in remembrance of me.
[time=2811] Would you learn these two lessons of history?
[time=2814] One.
[time=2816] God would stop at nothing to reach you.
[time=2821] There was no price that he was not willing to pay to reach you.
[time=2827] There was nothing that he would hold back to keep from reaching me.
[time=2833] Nothing, not even the death of his own son.
[time=2837] God says, I love you that much.
[time=2840] Whatever it takes, I'll pay the price to reach you.
[time=2846] When you hold that bread tonight, remember that God loves you.
[time=2852] Would you also remember a second history lesson?
[time=2856] Would you remember that sin has a penalty?
[time=2861] And that penalty costs Jesus his life.
[time=2864] It's not just a little distortion.
[time=2866] It costs Jesus his life.
[time=2869] It's not just a little shaving of an account.
[time=2872] It costs Jesus his life.
[time=2874] It's just not a little greed or a little covetousness.
[time=2878] It costs Jesus his life.
[time=2880] It's not just a word that maybe was gossip.
[time=2883] It costs Jesus his life.
[time=2887] That sin has a high price tag.
[time=2893] Jesus said, this do in remembrance of me.
[time=2897] As we think of Christianity, at the close of the 20th century, we must learn our history.
[time=2906] For remembrance is our remedy for the future.
[time=2910] If we don't know where we've come from, if we don't know what a cup means, if we don't know what that bread means, if we don't know what baptism represents, if we don't know that these scriptures teach principles of life,
[time=2930] we are a dying breed.
[time=2933] We must remember the past.
[time=2936] But these twelve stones teach us another lesson.
[time=2941] They teach us the importance of resisting the temptation to live in the immediate.
[time=2950] To live in the now, a man by the name of Vincent Regan-Rigiro, if I'm saying his last name right, was quoted in a journal called Vital Speeches of the Day.
[time=2965] He writes, "The impact of the popular culture is indeed powerful.
[time=2973] By age 18, the average student has spent 11,000 hours in the classroom,
[time=2979] but 22,000 hours in front of the television set."
[time=2985] He goes on to explain by his own observation that in a 30-minute television show, there were 39 different changes of set.
[time=2997] When the show went from this scene to the next scene to the third to the fourth to the commercial, to the commercial changing sets to the next commercial, back to the show changing set after set, 39 changes more than one per minute.
[time=3012] And the immediacy of our culture is this, to be entertained absolutely every minute of my life." He goes on to explain, "Young people need the habit of analyzing and reflecting." I'd like to say every remembering.
[time=3030] Popular culture encourages impulsiveness now, do it now, and gullibility.
[time=3040] Young people need a commitment to excellence.
[time=3042] Popular culture celebrates mediocrity, and he cites his examples.
[time=3048] Vanna White was given a book contract in a $30,000 honorarium for one speaking assignment, and Yogi Berra was asked to give his opinions of
[time=3062] what ought to be offered in primetime cinema.
[time=3067] Young people need sensitivity to moral issues.
[time=3071] Popular culture presents vice as virtue.
[time=3076] A convicted felon can easily obtain a substantial book advance for his story.
[time=3082] Indeed, the more bizarre the crime, the greater the advance.
[time=3088] The line between fame and infamy has been blurred,
[time=3094] if not erased.
[time=3098] All too often popular culture gives us exactly the opposite of what we need.
[time=3104] Laziness has become epidemics, so publishers produce books on the dangers of workaholism.
[time=3112] We are overrun with people intent on inflicting themselves on others, so we offer seminars on how to assert yourself.
[time=3122] More and more people are absorbed in themselves and insensitive to others, so popular culture emphasizes how to get in touch with yourself.
[time=3134] Our society says, "Live for me and do it now."
[time=3141] We must resist the urge to live in the immediate.
[time=3144] Someone humorously put these words in the disciples' mouth.
[time=3148] Jesus is midway through the Beatitudes, and Peter raises his hands and says, "Do we have to write this stuff down?" Andrew says, "Are we supposed to know all this stuff?" Philip says, "I don't have any paper." Bartholomew said, "The other disciples I knew never had to learn all this stuff." John said, "Do we have to turn this in for a grade?"
[time=3177] Matthew said, "Can I go to the little boys' room?" And Judah said, "Hey, what's this stuff have to do with real life now anyway?"
[time=3189] You know, when we come to God's Word, and if Joshua 1, verse 1 doesn't tell us how to look prettier, to make more money, to find more leisure, or to get ahead, what's this got to do with real life anyway?
[time=3202] Please don't sacrifice the alderman on the alder of the immediate.
[time=3207] Don't sacrifice the gift of purity to your future spouse on the alder of immediate sexual gratification.
[time=3216] Don't sacrifice the ultimate character of integrity on the alder of immediate bucks to get ahead by shaving a contract.
[time=3225] Don't sacrifice the alderman of financial stability on the alder of an immediate purchase that, "Ooh, that sounds like that'd be nice to have." Don't sacrifice a relationship on the alder of, "I want it my way now. Forget you." Don't sacrifice an excellent education on the alder of, "Hey, I can make $5 an hour as a manager and trainee." And someday, I may make $5.50 if I stay at it 20 years.
[time=3260] Those stones were stacked side by side, so people would remember their past.
[time=3266] And when they started to say, "I want to go back to Egypt," they wouldn't give in to those immediate appetites, but would look at a God who could deliver, provide, and protect.
[time=3282] Solomon looked at his life and he said, "I'm going to find out what it's all about, Alfie." And so he invested his life in the pursuit of work, and he became the original workaholic.
[time=3294] And at the end of that chapter of his life, he said, "I am miserable. I am weary. I can't sleep at night.
[time=3300] I worry about my money, and I worry about who's going to get it when I die." So he gave up on work, and he said, "I'm going to pursue pleasure." And he opened a new chapter in his book, and he became the headness of Haydenism.
[time=3313] And at the end of every pleasure and every indulgence in every self-gratification, he said, "I am empty." He opened up a new chapter of his life, and he pursued wisdom and learning and knowledge, and he came to this conclusion.
[time=3327] Of the writing of books, there is no end, and of the reading of them is weariness of the soul.
[time=3335] And so at the end of it all, he said, "Here's the resolution of the matter.
[time=3340] Remember by Creator in the days of the youth.
[time=3345] You don't live in the immediate." The third and final principle, those stones teach us, is this one.
[time=3352] It's important to recommit our future to the Lord.
[time=3358] Those stones were a memorial.
[time=3361] They were to remind a generation not only of a past, but how to live in the future.
[time=3368] Several months ago, Kathy and I had the privilege of going to Washington, D.C.
[time=3373] and went to Arlington Cemetery and sat on some steps and watched them guard the tomb of the unknown soldier.
[time=3381] We were impressed as the army man would march back and forth.
[time=3386] The ground was worn where his precise steps landed every time in the same place.
[time=3392] And I timed him with the second hand on my watch, and he never aired more than two or three seconds in a routine that took two and a half minutes, but never looked at his watch.
[time=3402] When his heels clicked, it was like the ringing of a bell.
[time=3406] What was he guarding?
[time=3408] A dead body.
[time=3410] Who's? I don't know. Nobody knows.
[time=3412] It's just a dead body.
[time=3415] Oh, no, it's not.
[time=3417] Whoever that young man is, or that young woman is, gave their life for my country.
[time=3425] They gave their life so that I could get in a car and I could drive from state to state any time I wanted to.
[time=3431] They died so that I can stand here behind this pulpit and say whatever I want to.
[time=3437] And that's not just the body.
[time=3439] That's the representative of the heritage of a country.
[time=3444] And I want my son someday to stand there and to watch that soldier and to know that some dad like me gave a son like him
[time=3455] so that I could have all of this.
[time=3459] And my heart was recommitted to a country.
[time=3464] I want to do something that has an impact with my life.
[time=3469] But more than that, I want my daughters and my sons to know about New Testament stones.
[time=3474] You know, there's nowhere in the New Testament to stack up the stones, but Peter says you are living stones.
[time=3481] You are the memorials and what memorials are we making for the next generation.
[time=3486] I want them to know of a Glen and Debbie Schick, who for eight years got up at five in the morning, put the little Chad in the basket and they would carry him here so they could be here before six in the morning to warm up television cameras so a Bible hour could come into your home.
[time=3502] I want them to know of seven families who were in the church of the day.
[time=3507] Emmanuel, strong and secure with a seasoned pastor and a good choir, and seven of them said, "We'll go on to the cornfield." We'll take these aluminum double-wide trailers and we'll put them out there on the edge of nowhere.
[time=3522] It's been our privilege to share with you the musical ministry
[time=3529] of our sanctuary choir, the handbell choir, and soloist Keith Brodygum.
[time=3534] The message today was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3537] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3542] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3545] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins, and today I know that I have a need for you to come into my heart and to cleanse me and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3560] I ask you to come in today.
[time=3562] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3566] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3570] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance," to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3578] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the pamphlet mentioned earlier, entitled "Money," please write to the Bible hour, seventy-four hundred east state, four-pointed Ianna, four-six-eight-one-five.
[time=3592] To receive a cassette copy of today's message,
[time=3598] write and request, take number 1397, or use the sermon title, "Remembering a Remedy for the Future." And please enclose a gift of three dollars to help defray the cost of providing this take.
[time=3610] The Bible hour is made possible
[time=3619] by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3621] Perhaps you've thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3625] Why not do it today?
[time=3626] I know it would be an encouragement to Pastor Rick and the entire Bible hour step.
[time=3631] You correspond with us simply write to the Bible hour, seventy-four hundred east state, four-pointed Ianna, four-six-eight-one-five.
[time=3639] Now speaking for Pastor Rick Hawks,
[time=3645] this is Bill VR inviting you to join us each week and this time for the Bible hour.
[time=3656] [SILENCE - 60 seconds]
[time=3746] You
