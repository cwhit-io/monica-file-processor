[time=90] (bell tolling) - Many religions throughout the world teach
[time=120] that entrance into heaven and eternal life will be determined solely upon the amount of good works that are performed by a person here on earth. But the Bible teaches that this simply is not true. Eternal life will be determined only upon
[time=134] our faith in Jesus Christ and our relationship with Him as Savior and Lord.
[time=138] Yet, lest we minimize the importance of good works, the Apostle Paul warns us
[time=144] that all believers will one day stand before the judgment seat of Christ and our works will be judged. Those works that are done diligently and with the proper motivation will stand the test of judgment and will shine like gold and silver for eternity. But those works that we have performed out of a lack of diligence and with the wrong motivation will not stand the test of judgment and they will be burned like wood or hay or stubble. All of us as believers are
[time=172] doing works every day. Are the works that you are doing for Christ the type that will shine like gold or are your works the type that will be burned like wood, hay, or stubble?
[time=183] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=204] Thank you for joining us. Our new associate pastor Jim Pearson will be sharing with us from the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3 with a message he has entitled "The Judgment of the Believer's Works." The sanctuary choir will be
[time=218] ministering to us in song.
[time=221] Other special music includes a number from the brass ensemble and a solo from
[time=229] Susan Toyrack. The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=236] Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time. We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you. Now here's
[time=248] Peter with us today and we trust that all of us that hear the name of Jesus sung and played might and hear the word of God preached might be blessed today and encouraged in your hearts. If you've come and you don't know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I hope you'll hear the message through the music and the spoken word and your heart will be pricked by that great knowledge that you can know him as a personal Savior. The choir and orchestra are going to sing now and they're going to sing a song that's entitled "Every Valley Shall Be Exalted, Every Mountain Made Low." [MUSIC]
[time=308] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=436] [APPLAUSE]
[time=441] Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. Let's continue with a song of Hope Him number 345. We'll sing all three verses together. 345.
[time=455] [MUSIC - 120 seconds]
[time=604] Amen. Thank you for your singing and a special thanks to our instrumentalists who help us so much in our congregational singing. Pastor Rick Hawks is on vacation right now. He'll be away from us for a couple weeks getting a well-deserved rest and we're glad when he can get away but also look forward to him coming back rested and anxious to begin his ministry again with us. Our new associate
[time=628] pastor Jim Pearson will be speaking to us in just a few moments. We're putting him to work right away and we're just grateful to have him aboard and on our staff and the fellowship and the ministry that he can give to us. Right now I'd like to have you listen to the orchestra as they perform for us a song that's familiar to all of us all hail the power of Jesus name and they'll be led by Wade Holbrook.
[time=650] [MUSIC - 153 seconds]
[time=813] [APPLAUSE]
[time=818] Again we want to thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour. Our pastor Rick
[time=824] Hawks is on a well-deserved vacation to Florida. He'll be gone for about two weeks.
[time=829] We're glad that he has the opportunity to get away and to be refreshed and we look forward to his soon return. Today in the studio we have a new associate pastor that we'd like to introduce to you Jim Pearson. Good morning Jim.
[time=841] Morning Pete. We're delighted that though Jim has been working with his part time he now has come full time to our staff and we're just happy that he has the opportunity to work with us and that we can associate with him. Jim tell us a little bit about your background will you? Well Pete when I first got out of college I was a social studies teacher for a period of four years and then after that I went into the scrap iron and steel business as a marketing representative and I did that for eight years and of course three years ago I made the decision to enter the ministry full-time. Well Jim we're glad that God called you to the ministry and we're also glad that we have the opportunity to be in fellowship here as staff members at Black Hawk Baptist Church. Your duties have changed just a little bit now that you're full-time tell us what you're going to be doing. Well Pete I will be working with Rick in the ministry related areas for the most part. I'll be doing some preaching teaching and also some organizing of some special projects. I'm sure that Rick is glad to have you on board to help out in some of the responsibilities in the areas where he's been overloaded and now that your responsibilities have changed that leaves avoid in another area who's going to take over those responsibilities. Well my wife Linda is the new children's ministries director at Black Hawk. She has already jumped into her duties and responsibilities and right now she's getting ready for the summer celebration which really is already going on. Well we're always excited about the summertime here because we do have our summer celebration and during the month of June our summer Bible conference and this Wednesday June 14th we'll be having Dr. Ivan French from the Pleasant Valley Bible Church in Warsaw. Jim he's been here before and he's been a real good speaker and our people have really responded to him. Yes Pete and then on the 21st we will have Dr. Carl Sovain from Fort Wayne Bible College. He's a fine professor and we're looking forward to hearing his message. And then finally on June 28th we'll have Dr. Bruce Dunn from the Grace Presbyterian Church in Peoria, Illinois an outstanding speaker so we encourage you to put those dates down and join us for this summer Bible conference during the month of June. Falling very closely on the heels of our summer Bible conference is our annual Patriotic Panorama. That will be held July 2nd and we're calling it Look Up America. The ensemble sounds alive we'll be seeing the sanctuary choir and other special soloists will be joining us to thank God for the country in which we live and thank him for the freedom that we have.
[time=986] So please set that data side that's July 2nd at 4 o'clock in the afternoon right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. We'd really be glad to have you with us. Just before we go back to our regular service we'd like to encourage you to write for the booklet Closer Walk. Closer Walk is a booklet that is given out monthly and is a devotional that helps us read the scripture on a regular basis and then makes commentary on that portion of scripture that you read for that day. We encourage you to write for that booklet today. Jim would you tell them the address? Yes Pete if you would like a copy of Closer Walk please write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State Boulevard
[time=1028] Fort Wayne Indiana 46815. Again that's the Bible Hour 7400 East
[time=1035] State Boulevard Fort Wayne Indiana 46815. Again Jim we welcome you
[time=1042] forward and now we go back to our regular program.
[time=1072] Of his name. Just to breathe the name of Jesus can turn everything around.
[time=1094] He's as close as the mention of his name. In my very hour of struggle so many
[time=1112] times I found Jesus close as the mention of his name. Just to breathe the
[time=1127] name of Jesus can turn everything around. He's as close as the mention of his name.
[time=1141] Jesus close as the mention of his name. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus close as the mention of his name.
[time=1170] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[time=1277] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.
[time=1314] Just to breathe the name of Jesus can turn everything around. He's as close as the mention. He's as close as the mention.
[time=1343] Jesus close as the mention of his name.
[time=1373] That beautiful name, Emmanuel. God with us. Thank you, Sue. I don't believe that song could have possibly been sung more beautifully than she did it this morning.
[time=1392] Our Father, thank you this morning that we can come together and worship you. Emmanuel. God with us.
[time=1401] Thank you, God, that you are with us and that you stick close with us no matter what it might be that we go through.
[time=1409] God, we come to you this morning with needs. This morning, God, we pray for John and Lorraine.
[time=1418] Lord, I just pray that you would send your healing hand down and that you would touch Lorraine and that you would heal her if that would be your will.
[time=1427] Father, we just ask you to comfort them and to wrap your loving arms around them.
[time=1433] And Father, we pray for so many others in our congregation with physical needs.
[time=1439] For needs that are things such as cancer or other ailments that are causing them to perhaps not be able to serve you the joyful way that they would want to.
[time=1451] We just ask you to bless them right now. We just ask you to bless us this morning in our time of Bible study, in our time of fellowship.
[time=1459] Speak through me this morning, Lord, as your instrument, that I might rightfully divide the truth and present it to the congregation.
[time=1466] I just ask all of these things in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ, Emmanuel. God with us. Amen.
[time=1474] It is a joy and a privilege to be back once again and to be able to bring a message on a Sunday morning.
[time=1483] It was last December when I preached last on a Sunday morning and that was truly a blessing to me.
[time=1490] The last time that I preached was about a few weeks ago at Grace Seminary.
[time=1495] I had the privilege of speaking to a chapel audience of my colleagues and also my professors and that was a little disconcerting.
[time=1504] And so as I was preparing the night before, as I finished my message, I decided I would take out some of the evaluations that you receive from your colleagues as you go through the three-year training program.
[time=1516] And I looked at the evaluations that I had been given while I was going through the various preaching classes.
[time=1522] And I was stopped as I looked at one and it read, "Use of illustrations, good, content of message, good."
[time=1532] And then it said, "Preacher's appearance," and it said, "Ugly." And I was kind of stopped by that and then right next to it he had written, "But then again, there's nothing you can do about that."
[time=1543] That was a humbling experience, more humbling than facing those fellow seminarians and my professors for those three years.
[time=1552] If you have a Bible with you this morning, I'd like you to turn with me to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
[time=1558] The book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3, and in a moment I'm going to be reading verses 10 through 17.
[time=1567] 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
[time=1572] One of the great marvels of our world today are the ancient pyramids which stand on the west side of the Nile River Valley.
[time=1582] The great pyramids are a marvel and they are a testimony to the engineering and architectural genius of the Egyptian people.
[time=1593] They were originally constructed as burial sites for the Egyptian rulers, but as time has gone on, they have come to just stand as a monument.
[time=1602] One of the great ones was built by an emperor by the name of Kufu.
[time=1607] This Egyptian emperor constructed a pyramid that took 20 years to build.
[time=1613] Indeed, as many as 50,000 men worked on its construction at any one time.
[time=1620] The pyramid was so large and so heavy that no foundation could be made or no foundation could be laid which could hold the pyramid properly.
[time=1630] And so the Egyptians designed a magnificent method of taking away all of the topsoil and the gravel and the dirt and they dug down to the ground down to the foundation rock.
[time=1645] And as they did that, they were able to build that pyramid upon the proper foundation as they placed it upon that bedrock layer.
[time=1655] As they began to construct it, they made it out of indestructible limestone blocks that they fashioned with copper and brass tools.
[time=1664] And then they dragged those two and a half ton blocks and they put them in place in a marvelous fashion.
[time=1671] They took gypsum, which was a lubricant, and they greased the blocks.
[time=1675] And today, many of those blocks, as they come up against each other, have a gap of no more than one-fiftieth of an inch.
[time=1684] Oh, the great pyramids are a tremendous marvel. 4,000 years later, they stand.
[time=1692] They stand and they have stood the test of time.
[time=1697] They have stood against the wind and the sand and the water and the years.
[time=1703] They have stood and they still stand as a marvel of engineering genius.
[time=1711] Why do they stand? What is it about the pyramids which has caused them to stand for so long?
[time=1719] It's because they were built upon the proper foundation.
[time=1723] They were built upon that proper bedrock foundation.
[time=1726] Also, they were built from the right materials.
[time=1730] They were built from materials that wouldn't perish, the indestructible limestone.
[time=1736] They stand because they were engineered by masters.
[time=1742] That came back to me this week as I studied our passage for this morning.
[time=1747] I remembered that from sixth grade social studies, and so I went back to look up some of those facts again.
[time=1754] But it's interesting because Paul, writing to the believers at Corinth, is using a word picture.
[time=1760] He is using the word picture of a building, of a structure.
[time=1765] And this building represents the works of the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=1771] The structure which Paul is describing represents all of the works that we do and all the works that have been done since the days of Paul.
[time=1782] Just as the pyramids have stood the test, our works will have to stand the test.
[time=1788] For the Bible teaches that there will be a judgment someday.
[time=1792] It will not be a judgment whereby our salvation will be decided.
[time=1796] No, if we've trusted in Christ as Savior, then our salvation has been sealed for all eternity.
[time=1802] But our works, those things that we do for Christ in our daily lives,
[time=1808] those things that we do out of our devotion to Him will have to stand the test of the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=1816] And I believe that Paul is saying that like the pyramids, our works will stand the test only if they are built on the proper foundation.
[time=1827] Only if they are constructed of the proper materials.
[time=1832] And only if our design and our motivation has been proper in our lives.
[time=1838] And so Paul paints us a wonderful picture of a building.
[time=1843] He begins in verse 10 and I want to read from there through verse 17.
[time=1849] According to the grace of God, which was given to me as a wise master builder,
[time=1855] I laid a foundation and another is building upon it.
[time=1859] But let each man be careful how he builds upon it.
[time=1862] For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[time=1868] Now if any man builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay and straw, each man's works will become evident.
[time=1877] For the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.
[time=1887] If any man's work which he has built upon it remains, he shall receive a reward.
[time=1893] If a man's work is burned up, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire.
[time=1902] Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[time=1907] If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him.
[time=1911] For the temple of God is holy and that is what you are.
[time=1915] This morning I would like us to see from this passage five aspects of the work of the Lord's people upon this earth.
[time=1925] Five aspects of the work of the church from the days of the Apostle Paul until the second coming of Jesus Christ our Lord for his people as he comes both for his church and in judgment.
[time=1938] The first one is found in verse ten. For the first aspect that I would like us to see is that the master builder was the Apostle Paul.
[time=1948] According to the grace of God which was given to me as a wise master builder I laid a foundation.
[time=1956] Paul begins our passage by explaining his role in the very beginning.
[time=1961] The Apostle Paul said I am the master builder.
[time=1966] It's interesting because the word translated here master builder comes from the Greek word architect tone.
[time=1973] And that of course is the word that we have just carried bodily over into our English language and we have given it to that work that we call architect or architecture.
[time=1984] And so Paul is saying not that I was the designer for the word carried a different meaning in the days of Paul but Paul is saying that I am the construction foreman.
[time=1995] I am the one laying the foundation.
[time=1998] I am the one who is the beginning.
[time=2000] I am the master builder.
[time=2002] I am beginning the process with my work and my role.
[time=2007] Paul's specialty was foundations. As you read through the book of Acts you will see that Paul established foundations for churches to be built upon all over the realm of the New Testament.
[time=2019] And it was Paul who was so critical.
[time=2022] Paul was the one who laid the proper foundation of the gospel message.
[time=2027] It was his role to establish and teach proper and sound biblical doctrine.
[time=2033] It was the role of Paul to stress the proper principles of Christian living as God gave them to him and he gave them to the early church.
[time=2043] Now how important was Paul as the master builder?
[time=2048] In the 11th chapter of the book of Acts we see that wonderful fresh new church the church at Antioch is born.
[time=2055] And the word gets back to Jerusalem that there is a group of new believers at Antioch and they are praising God and they are worshiping.
[time=2062] And evangelism is going on and it was wonderful and the church in Jerusalem was blessed.
[time=2066] And so they sent Barnabas.
[time=2068] And Barnabas went and as he came to the church at Antioch it said that his heart leaped with joy and he saw the work and the power of the Holy Spirit at work.
[time=2077] And he thought how wonderful this is but then what did he do?
[time=2081] He said I've got to go find Paul.
[time=2086] For it's Paul who lays the foundations.
[time=2088] Paul is the master builder.
[time=2090] And so in that 26th verse it says that he went to find Paul and the Greek there indicates that he sought diligently to find him.
[time=2098] That he had to look but he finally found him and he brought Paul to Antioch and the Bible says that together Barnabas and Paul stayed for one year.
[time=2106] And they instructed and they grounded the people of the church at Antioch in the faith.
[time=2113] Yes, Paul was so important.
[time=2117] He was the foundation layer.
[time=2119] He was the master builder.
[time=2121] Yet as important as Paul was, note the humility right at the beginning of verse 10 when he says according to the grace of God which was given to me.
[time=2134] Paul says I have done all of these things.
[time=2137] I have started over half of the New Testament churches.
[time=2141] I have laid foundations all over this land for Jesus Christ but not once did I do it of my own power.
[time=2147] I did it only through the power of Jesus Christ as he empowered me to do it.
[time=2153] There's a lesson to be learned there because Paul then says but let each man be careful how he builds upon it.
[time=2161] And that's where you and I come into the picture.
[time=2164] Let each man be careful how he builds upon it.
[time=2168] For Paul says I have laid the foundation through the power of Jesus Christ.
[time=2173] I have laid the foundation and now I leave it to you.
[time=2177] I turn the work of the church over to you to his disciples first but then to every believer down through eternity as we construct this building that Paul is describing.
[time=2188] This superstructure of our works which will be based upon the solid foundation.
[time=2193] And Paul says I leave it to you.
[time=2196] Don't be careless.
[time=2197] Be diligent.
[time=2198] Be careful how you build.
[time=2202] I remember in my eight years in the business world I came in touch with many companies that were family owned.
[time=2208] Some of them were large, some of them were small, some were prosperous and some were not.
[time=2214] But as I studied those companies and got to know them I saw that very often the company had been founded by a hard driving grandfather maybe 75 years ago.
[time=2226] And he had gotten into the business and he had strove hard and he had laid a solid foundation and the company had thrived and it had grown.
[time=2234] And then he had passed the torch to a son and that son had built upon the foundation.
[time=2239] And he had built this superstructure through his hard work and some companies had grown more and more prosperous.
[time=2246] But as I noticed over time some who had not been quite so diligent found that their companies began to sputter or began to struggle.
[time=2255] And sometimes by the third generation the workers were not building well on the foundation.
[time=2263] Paul is saying that we as believers must build upon the foundation that he has laid and we must do it carefully and diligently through the works that we perform for Jesus Christ.
[time=2276] And then as we move on to verse 11 we come across perhaps the most important point of the message this morning.
[time=2284] For the second aspect of the work of the Lord's people on earth today is that the foundation, the proper foundation is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ alone.
[time=2296] In verse 11 "For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid which is Jesus Christ."
[time=2306] The Apostle Paul is saying even though I was the master builder, even though I was the architect tone, I am not the designer for the foundation was laid before the very foundation of the universe was laid and that foundation was Jesus Christ.
[time=2321] And all that I do Paul says every foundation that I lay must be laid solely and completely on Jesus Christ.
[time=2329] That for us as believers today is so critical, it's so important for us to remember.
[time=2335] The foundation that Paul laid was Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[time=2340] It was Jesus Christ as the only way of salvation.
[time=2345] It was Jesus Christ as the only way to eternal life and eternity with God in heaven.
[time=2353] Jesus Christ is the only foundation. In the days of Paul the religious leaders of the day were not constructing their foundation upon Jesus Christ.
[time=2366] They had rejected him and they had chosen to follow a system of works and they were telling people that that was the way.
[time=2373] This man is not the Messiah. This Jesus is not the Savior. We have a system, a system of works and you're to follow them.
[time=2382] It's no different in our day today. There are many churches and many groups which are not founded upon the foundation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2391] Some religions today are teaching that all that's necessary for you to make it to heaven is to just live your life.
[time=2399] For God who is all love will never send anybody to an eternity away from him.
[time=2404] But the Bible doesn't teach that. The Bible never teaches that.
[time=2408] There are other denominations or even world religions which will teach that if you just do your best and do good works on this earth one day when you stand before God he will welcome you into heaven.
[time=2419] Again that's not what the Bible teaches. The Bible teaches that justification is by faith in Christ alone.
[time=2426] That's the only foundation. It's the only foundation that Paul laid.
[time=2431] It's the only foundation that you and I are to build upon. Everything that we do all of our life is to be built upon the foundation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2442] My wife Linda was telling me a story as I discussed this message with her this week.
[time=2447] It concerns her family in a trip that they took when she was a young girl to Daytona Beach, Florida.
[time=2452] Now as you know Daytona Beach, Florida has a drive on beach and you can take your car and drive right on and this one day in Florida Linda's father pulled the car on and he got a little bit too close to the water.
[time=2463] But the tide was out so there was no problem and they jumped out of the car and got the things out of the trunk and began having fun in the sand and the sun and the ocean.
[time=2473] But I think it was that great theologian Yogi Berra who once said it's amazing what you can observe by just watching.
[time=2482] And Linda's mom was watching as the tide began to come in and she was watching as the water began to wash the sand out of the way under the tires of the car.
[time=2493] And she warned Linda's dad that the tide was coming in but they were having so much fun they kept on playing.
[time=2499] But then finally as the tide threatened to bury the car up to the fender wells they saw that they had an emergency and they jumped into the car and were able to push it, push it out and onto the firmer beach.
[time=2511] The reason that that happened is because their car was not standing on the proper foundation.
[time=2517] It was standing on a foundation of sand which could be washed away.
[time=2522] The Bible teaches that we are to stand only on the foundation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2527] It is the foundation that we preach.
[time=2530] It is the foundation that you and I teach.
[time=2533] It is the foundation that you and I evangelize with.
[time=2537] It is the foundation that enters into all that we do for Jesus Christ because all that we do is to worship him and to attempt to draw others to him through the power of the Holy Spirit but through our evangelistic efforts.
[time=2551] The foundation, Jesus Christ.
[time=2555] And then our third point this morning as we move on, the third aspect of the work of the church upon this earth is found in the following verse.
[time=2566] Now if any man builds upon the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay or straw, the third aspect this morning is the building materials.
[time=2579] The building materials which will go into this structure which we are building upon the foundation laid by Paul.
[time=2586] And those building materials are the works that you and I do in our lives for Jesus Christ.
[time=2593] They are the works that you and I perform as we go through this daily life of living for Jesus Christ and serving him.
[time=2602] All believers, all believers as we walk upon this earth are building.
[time=2608] All of us as we serve Christ whether we're giving him our best or we're giving him our least, all of us are building some type of a structure upon that foundation.
[time=2620] And here Paul gives us two different types of building materials which will be the test of the believer's works.
[time=2628] First of all he says now if any man builds upon the foundation with gold, silver and precious stones.
[time=2636] The gold and silver and precious stones that are mentioned here represent the valuable works that you and I do for the cause of Jesus Christ.
[time=2645] They represent the faithful work, the diligent service, they represent the times when we're in the trenches serving him and working for him.
[time=2655] They represent those faithful diligent works where we give Christ our best and not our leftovers.
[time=2662] Where we give him the best hours of the day and not the least.
[time=2666] Where we give him our talents and our gifts and all that he has given us and we use them for him.
[time=2673] Yes the silver, the gold, the precious stones, they represent the works of high value and all of us are building works of one type or another.
[time=2686] And then he mentions wood, hay and straw. And these represent the works of the believer.
[time=2695] The works of the believer who is not faithful, he's not diligent, he's slothful in his daily life and he's giving God only the leftovers of his time.
[time=2705] He's giving God only that grudging bit. All right I'll present the gospel. All right I'll mention it.
[time=2716] All right I'll invite that worker at work over but I don't really want to. I don't really want to do it. I'd rather do something else.
[time=2723] Those grudging works, the slothful works are represented by wood, hay and stubble.
[time=2729] And Paul says later in this verse that those works will be consumed and burned. They are the least value. They are of the least value.
[time=2739] Our service, our conduct, our motives. Why do we do what we do for Jesus Christ can determine how whether our works are gold or whether they're wood and hay and straw.
[time=2752] I remember in 1974 when I was born again and there was a new excitement in my life and as I jumped into service to God I determined that I would give him the best of my works, the best of my life.
[time=2763] And I studied and I taught and I did all the things that I could do to serve him and I felt that I was giving him the valuable works, the gold and the precious stones.
[time=2773] But I also remember that after a few years there was a period of time when I began to give him only the wood and the hay and the stubble.
[time=2782] I let some other things in my life be more important than God and I began to push him onto the back burner of my life.
[time=2789] And as a result my works became less and less valuable until by the early 1980s I really wasn't serving him. Oh I was a believer, I was a believer, but I was letting other priorities crowd him out.
[time=2804] But then there was a time when I heard a sermon preached by our own pastor Rick Hawks and it challenged my heart.
[time=2813] It happened the very first Sunday that I sat in a pew in Blackhawk Baptist Church and I told myself I must rededicate my life.
[time=2821] I cannot stand in both worlds. I must rededicate my life and go back to giving him the best.
[time=2828] I'm tired of giving him the leftovers. All of us as believers must make that decision.
[time=2836] Do we do it every day? Do we make that decision to give him our best or do we make possibly an unconscious decision to give him only the leftovers?
[time=2849] Oh the Apostle Paul is saying only the good works that we do, only the works of value will survive the test of judgment.
[time=2860] And then he goes on in verse 13 and he gives us our fourth aspect of this work of the church on earth as he says in verse 13 that there will be a test of the believer's works and it will be by fire.
[time=2874] In verse 13 he says each man's works will become evident for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's work.
[time=2886] Paul is saying that there will come a time when our motivations and our works will become evident.
[time=2893] They will be exposed. That's a frightening thought. I can grudgingly give God my efforts or I can do them from the wrong motive.
[time=2905] But no one's probably going to know that except me and the Lord.
[time=2910] But the Bible says that I will not be able to keep that a secret if that be the case forever because one day there will come a time when my works and your works and all believers works will be exposed and revealed.
[time=2926] It says for the day will show it. That's referring to what the Bible calls the day of the Lord. It's mentioned in 1 Thessalonians and several other times.
[time=2935] The day of the Lord is the second coming of Jesus Christ when he will return and Paul is saying at that time that he returns you and I and all believers will stand before him in judgment.
[time=2949] Again, not a judgment to determine whether we inherit eternal life or not for if we believe that has been sealed but a judgment to determine whether our works for him have been of gold and precious stones or whether they have been of wood and hay and straw.
[time=2970] It says that they will be tested by fire. Many times in Scripture the use of fire is used for judgment, the idea of purging and burning. It's used to refer to judgment.
[time=2982] And what he is saying is that the gold and the silver and the precious stones and the wood and the hay and the stubble will all be put into a crucible and the heat will be applied.
[time=2994] And the works that we have done with a lack of diligence and with a lack of proper motivation will be consumed and they will be worthless.
[time=3005] But those things that we have done of value they will remain the gold and the silver and the precious stones.
[time=3013] I remember when I was in the scrap iron and steel business we had something which we called a sweat furnace and a sweat furnace was something that we would put aluminum into.
[time=3022] People would come to our retail operation and they would bring aluminum screen doors, aluminum shays, lounge chairs, all kinds of aluminum but it was contaminated.
[time=3032] It had cloth attached to it, some time it had wood attachments, some time it had other types of steel contamination.
[time=3039] And so we would take it and we would put it into a furnace and we would turn up the heat and we would purge the aluminum.
[time=3049] And then as the heat would go up the worthless things, the wood, the cloth and all of those things would be consumed.
[time=3058] And at one temperature the aluminum would melt and it would drain into an ingot mold.
[time=3063] And then when it was done and it was hardened we would have a pure aluminum ingot that could be later remelted and used.
[time=3071] Oh the analogy is so obvious, the analogy is so obvious.
[time=3076] All of our works good and bad will stand the test of fire but only those that we have done which our value will remain.
[time=3086] Now I think it's fair for you to ask the question what are these works that we're speaking of?
[time=3091] What exactly are our works?
[time=3095] Well I believe that that is made very plain in Scripture for our works are the things that we do on a daily basis that are commanded for believers to do in Scripture.
[time=3109] It is the things that we do that are commanded by God in Scripture.
[time=3115] And so let there be no confusion that we're talking about as I said earlier, our conduct, our service, the things that God has told us to do.
[time=3124] To be winsome, to be gentle, to be kind, to reach out to our fellow man, to be evangelistic, to not be contentious, but to do good valuable works for him.
[time=3140] Yes, there will be a judgment one day, and our good works, our faithful fulfillment of the commandments of God will stand, but our worthless works will be consumed.
[time=3155] There's a song that is so appropriate that says, "Tis only one life will soon be passed, but only what's done for Christ will last."
[time=3169] All must determine this morning.
[time=3172] Are the works that we are putting in?
[time=3174] Are the building materials that we are building upon this foundation with?
[time=3178] Are they of value?
[time=3179] Are we giving God our best?
[time=3182] Or are we giving Him our wood and our hay and our stubble?
[time=3186] Oh the picture here of this judgment is clear, and that's the fifth and final point that I would like to make this morning.
[time=3195] As we move on, I want us to see the workman, the workman.
[time=3199] In verses 14 and 15 it says, "If any man's work which he has built upon it remains, he shall receive a reward."
[time=3208] If any man's work is burn up, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved.
[time=3215] I want to point out that both workmen at this judgment are believers, but here we have represented the two categories of materials.
[time=3224] The first man in verse 14 is what I would call the constructive workman.
[time=3229] This is the one who has built his life on giving his best and giving his time and faithful work to his Lord.
[time=3237] And it says that if any man's work which he has built upon it remains, he shall receive a reward.
[time=3244] Our conduct, our effective service will stand the test of Christ's judgment.
[time=3252] Now what are these rewards that Paul is mentioning?
[time=3256] What are these rewards?
[time=3258] For me, the only reward that I will ever need is for Jesus Christ as he speaks to me to say, "Jim, well done, my good and faithful servant."
[time=3270] I would need no other reward from my life of service to him, but the Bible says that there will be rewards for the believer.
[time=3277] The Bible calls them crowns, and if we survey the New Testament, we can see several of these crowns for those who are faithful soul winners.
[time=3288] For those who are faithful soul winners, there's the crown of exaltation.
[time=3294] For those who are faithful pastors, there's the crown of unfading glory.
[time=3300] For those who are faithful in their daily lives, there is the crown of righteousness.
[time=3305] And one day, hopefully if we live for him, we will receive one of those crowns or more.
[time=3311] And then we can take them and we can throw them at his feet.
[time=3314] And we can say, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for allowing me to serve you." And he'll say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. Enter in to the joy of your master."
[time=3327] But notice then in verse 15, "If any man's work is burnt up, he shall suffer loss. But he himself shall be saved."
[time=3336] This is what I call the worthless workman. Oh, he's a believer. He's saved. But he's giving God the leftovers.
[time=3343] He's giving God the very least. He's not giving him his best on a daily basis.
[time=3349] And the Bible says that when the fire comes, his works will be burned. He will be saved by the skin of his teeth.
[time=3357] He will make it, but he will make it so as by fire with all of his works burned away.
[time=3365] He'll make it to heaven. He won't lose his salvation.
[time=3370] But oh, what a condemnation and a humiliation. To stand before Christ on that day of the judgment of the believer's works
[time=3379] and to have the things that we did, replayed back to us and to see them burned by the fire of judgment.
[time=3389] This morning, we've been speaking about two different types of workmen, constructive workmen, worthless workmen.
[time=3397] Each of us as believers must make a constant determination, a conscious determination as to what type of believer we will be.
[time=3407] And I would challenge myself as I did this week. I challenge myself and I have said I will give God my best.
[time=3415] I'll give him the most faithful works that I can and I'll live for him every day. I want my works to stand like gold.
[time=3424] I want them to stand. But the Bible says that just like those great pyramids, just like the great pyramids that have stood
[time=3433] for 4,000 years against the test of time, if my works will stand the test, they must be upon the proper foundation.
[time=3441] They must be made with the proper materials and they must be designed with proper engineering.
[time=3448] If they are, then I will stand. Are you a constructive workmen this morning? Are you giving God your best?
[time=3457] What perhaps have you like me at one point in my Christian life? Push God unto the back burner and said,
[time=3466] I just won't give him my best. I'm too busy at this point of my life. All of us must make that decision.
[time=3475] We must decide how we will serve him every day.
[time=3481] And so as we prepare to go into the final music portion of our program in just a moment,
[time=3491] I would challenge us to introspectively look at ourselves and to make that conscious determination.
[time=3499] I am going to give my best to Jesus Christ. I want my works to remain and be silver in gold.
[time=3524] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and orchestra and soloist Susan Toyrak.
[time=3531] The message today was from our associate pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=3535] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3539] Just before we close, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3544] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3552] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3556] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse me.
[time=3560] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3564] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3569] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
