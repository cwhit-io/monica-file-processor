[time=0] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=112] Have you ever been hurt by someone?
[time=114] Maybe over and over again by the same person?
[time=116] And have you ever wondered am I really supposed to forgive that person?
[time=120] If so, how many times?
[time=122] And does forgiveness mean that I have to entrust that person again?
[time=126] Those are some of the questions we'll be asking.
[time=128] We look into God's Word this morning for principles of forgiveness.
[time=132] [MUSIC]
[time=147] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=151] Thank you for joining us.
[time=153] While Rick is away, our youth pastor, Tim Teder, will be bringing us a message he has entitled, 490 then pal. Our text is taken from the book of Matthew chapter 18 verses 21 through 35.
[time=166] The sanctuary choir and Lisa Renaker will be ministering to us in song.
[time=173] Other special music includes a duet from Ron Hackett and Dennis Kirschner.
[time=179] And a solo from Joni King.
[time=184] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hall Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can't be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=192] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=196] [MUSIC]
[time=198] Now here's Peter.
[time=200] Also then welcome people who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=204] We're glad you've joined us today and I trust that at home and in this service that we'll be blessed and encouraged by everything that happens.
[time=212] A number of years ago there was a telegram, a cable gram sent from Europe back to the United States
[time=218] that said two words saved alone.
[time=221] That was a cable gram sent by Mrs. Spafford to her husband, Horatio Spafford,
[time=227] and he learned at that particular time that his wife alone was saved from a tragic C accident
[time=234] but his four daughters drowned in that accident.
[time=238] He immediately left for Europe and when he got to the spot where his daughters drowned he paused and he penned the words that the choir is going to sing today.
[time=249] It is well with my soul.
[time=254] [MUSIC]
[time=266] Now he's like a river, a tenderth my way.
[time=278] When sorrows like sea bills roll.
[time=286] Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to save.
[time=297] With his wealth, with his wealth, with his soul.
[time=308] It is well with my soul.
[time=319] It is well, it is well with my soul.
[time=330] My sin, all the bliss of this glorious thought.
[time=344] My sin, not in heart, not the home.
[time=353] Is there to cross?
[time=358] And thy very power brings the light.
[time=366] With his love, with his soul.
[time=375] It is well with my soul.
[time=387] With his wealth, with his wealth, with his soul.
[time=399] With the Lord haste the day when my faith shall be sought.
[time=410] The clouds be the best as the sky.
[time=421] The joy shall be heard, the joy shall be heard.
[time=434] Now he's wealth with my soul.
[time=445] It is well with my soul.
[time=483] It is well with my soul because of Jesus our comforter.
[time=509] Continue with wonderful words of life as we sing 270.
[time=513] We'll sing all three verses of him number 270.
[time=568] God send us in the music hall.
[time=573] We'll sing all three verses of time.
[time=661] Thank you for your good singing today.
[time=663] We appreciate that.
[time=665] Our pastor Rick is on vacation.
[time=667] He'll be returning this week.
[time=668] We look forward to seeing him again.
[time=670] I hope that he's had a restful time these last two weeks.
[time=673] Last week we had the privilege of hearing Jim Pearson, a new associate pastor, and today in a few moments we'll be hearing from our youth pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=682] Many years ago the Bible hour was called the Heritage Hour.
[time=685] And probably two of the most popular soloists and duet team were Ron Hackett and Dennis Kirschner.
[time=693] They've not sung for a long time, but they're old timers around here.
[time=697] We appreciate him in the choir and special music over the years.
[time=701] I'm just delighted that they're together again today and have the opportunity to sing for us.
[time=706] Let's listen now as Ron Hackett and Dennis Kirschner sing for us.
[time=710] "Dark is the road that lies before me.
[time=730] How can I find my way?
[time=739] Tangle the path that beckons to me.
[time=749] Lead me, O Lord, I pray.
[time=758] Lead me, O lead me.
[time=768] Never will I go astray, O Lord.
[time=777] Lead me, O lead me.
[time=787] Lead me 'til I reach my heavenly home.
[time=796] Dangers are lurking holes I threaten.
[time=806] Satan is power has shown.
[time=815] Stay by my side, protest and guide me.
[time=825] I do not walk alone.
[time=835] Lead me, O lead me.
[time=844] Never will I go astray, O Lord.
[time=853] Lead me, O lead me.
[time=862] Lead me 'til I reach my heavenly home.
[time=872] Never will I go astray, O Lord.
[time=881] Lead me 'til I reach my heavenly home.
[time=902] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=905] The letters and cards that have been sent in recently have been a great source of encouragement for us.
[time=910] Our pastor Rick Hawks will be returning next week.
[time=913] In just a few moments we'll be hearing from our youth pastor Tim Teder as he speaks to us.
[time=919] Right now our summer celebration is in full swing and during the month of June we've had our summer Bible conference.
[time=926] On Wednesday June 21st at 7 p.m. we'll have Dr. Carl Solvine.
[time=931] Dr. Solvine is from the Fort Wayne Bible College right here in our city and we look forward to his message to us.
[time=938] And then on June 28th we'll have Pastor Bruce Dunn.
[time=942] Pastor Dunn is from the Grace Bible Church in Peoria, Illinois.
[time=946] He's been with us before and we look forward to his message on what's happening in America.
[time=951] Following closely on the heels of our summer Bible conference is our annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=957] That'll be held July 2nd at 4 p.m.
[time=960] right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=962] I hope that you can set that day to site and join us for the great celebration entitled Look Up America.
[time=969] Once again that's at 4 p.m. July 2nd.
[time=972] Come and join us for this great celebration.
[time=975] And then in the month of July, continuing in our summer celebration on Wednesday evenings, our own pastor Rick Hawks will be speaking on the deity of Christ and the denial of Jesus Christ.
[time=987] We look forward to those messages and we hope that you will set all of these dates aside and join us.
[time=993] We have been advertising a booklet entitled Closer Walk.
[time=996] We think is a very, very helpful booklet for you in your reading devotions.
[time=1001] Recently I have people that come into my office and say do you have five or ten minutes?
[time=1006] And usually I can give them that time.
[time=1008] And I'm saying that to you today.
[time=1010] Do you have five or ten minutes to look into God's Word to read it and then have a brief analysis of what has been read for that particular day.
[time=1018] It's a great way to learn God's Word.
[time=1021] So I hope that you will write today for this free booklet and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1036] That's the Bible Hour 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1044] You also will notice that as we were showing you the Closer Walk booklet right for that booklet we want you also to receive a pamphlet on fathers entitled Faith of Our Fathers.
[time=1056] Once again you can receive both of these booklets by writing to the Bible Hour 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1067] And now it's our privilege to go back to our regular service and look forward to the message from our youth pastor, Tim Tedder.
[time=1078] [MUSIC]
[time=1088] Make it till the tide and call the angry sing.
[time=1094] Hear your learn decide to write to sin for now.
[time=1102] He lights every star that makes a darkness bright.
[time=1109] He keeps watch of you, each long and long and bright.
[time=1117] [MUSIC]
[time=1147] We can grant a wish and make a dream come true.
[time=1157] He can paint the clouds and turn the gray to blue.
[time=1165] He alone is where to find the rainbows and he alone knows where to fall.
[time=1176] He can paint the clouds and he can paint the leaves too warm.
[time=1187] He knows every lie that you and I have told.
[time=1195] Though it makes it sad to see the way we live, we love itself.
[time=1204] [MUSIC]
[time=1224] Thank you, Joni.
[time=1226] It's quieting to think about the Lord and the characteristics that he has toward us.
[time=1233] Our memory verse for the month of June focuses upon our response and our responsibility before such a great God.
[time=1240] Please stand now and join me in reciting our verse for June.
[time=1248] Hebrews 12-1, "Therefore, since we have such a great cloud of witnesses, let us put off everything that hinders
[time=1260] and the sin so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us."
[time=1270] Hebrews 12-1. Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1278] Appreciate the message of Joni's song this morning.
[time=1283] God is always willing to say, "I forgive." That's the theme of our consideration today.
[time=1292] The forgiveness of God and how we in turn are to forgive others.
[time=1298] What I hope to do this morning is to answer three questions.
[time=1304] First question, "How many times should I forgive?"
[time=1310] Secondly, "How far should my forgiveness reach?" And the third question, "How deeply should I forgive?"
[time=1321] The foundation for our consideration is found in the Book of Matthew chapter 18.
[time=1327] And if you take the time to turn there, Jesus has been teaching his disciples, his followers, and he's been saying a number of things.
[time=1338] And he comes to one point in his lesson, and he begins telling the disciples how they must treat someone who sins against them,
[time=1346] and the procedure that should be followed when an individual hurts or does something that is wrong against you.
[time=1354] They were sitting there listening to the lesson, and at least one of them was a good student.
[time=1361] Because we find that Peter listened to what Jesus said, and he must have been thinking about it considering it,
[time=1367] because when the lesson was over, Peter was still thinking about it, and that's a good thing.
[time=1373] How many times do we come into a church service, listen to a sermon, or sit in a Sunday school class,
[time=1379] and we hear the lesson that's being taught, and everything is good, and the truth is there, things that we can apply to our life.
[time=1386] But the closing prayer comes, and the back door is open, and we are on our way out, looking for Ant Edna,
[time=1394] to talk about our latest corn surgery or something.
[time=1397] And we've completely forgotten everything that we heard before.
[time=1400] Peter took the lesson, even when the lesson was over, and he thought about it.
[time=1406] And it says in verse 21 of chapter 18 that Peter came to Jesus, and he asked a question.
[time=1413] It was something like this.
[time=1416] Jesus, I know you've said we're supposed to forgive our brothers.
[time=1421] We're supposed to forgive others when they do something against us.
[time=1426] But how many times should I forgive a brother when he sins against me?
[time=1431] Now perhaps in Peter's mind when he asked that question, he was thinking of what the Jewish rabbis taught.
[time=1439] They taught that the people were to forgive up to three times for an offense, and then you were not obligated,
[time=1447] and probably shouldn't forgive beyond that.
[time=1449] And so maybe in Peter's thinking, he was thinking, I know the rabbis teach three times, and Jesus seems to go beyond what they do so much.
[time=1456] So in Peter's question, he said, Jesus, how many times should I forgive a brother when he sins against me?
[time=1463] Maybe as many as seven times?
[time=1469] Jesus said Peter not seven times.
[time=1472] Maybe Peter was thinking a little too much from anyway.
[time=1476] Jesus said 70 times seven.
[time=1483] I don't know how much of a math wiz Peter was.
[time=1486] When he thought, 490 times?
[time=1491] 490 times?
[time=1494] What if Peter had taken Jesus literally?
[time=1499] If that was a literal number that we're supposed to keep record of, perhaps we would have seen something like this sometime later on.
[time=1507] Imagine a beach along the shore of Galilee.
[time=1510] John, one of the disciples of Jesus, is there warming himself by a fire, a few pieces of fish left by the fire.
[time=1517] And Peter rushes in.
[time=1519] Hey John, John, now listen buddy, I've listened to the things.
[time=1522] I've heard the things you've been saying about me.
[time=1524] Bartholomew told me, don't try to deny it.
[time=1526] You said that I stick my foot in my mouth so many times that my lips are shaped like sandals.
[time=1532] You did say it didn't you?
[time=1535] Now listen here buddy, let me tell you.
[time=1538] Just a minute.
[time=1541] John, John, John, John.
[time=1546] 489.
[time=1551] Okay John, listen, I know you don't deserve it.
[time=1554] You know you don't deserve it either.
[time=1556] But listen, I'm just forgiven for a good, okay?
[time=1558] We'll just forget that.
[time=1560] Boy, am I hungry.
[time=1563] Hey John, where's my fish?
[time=1565] The big one that was sitting right in the fire.
[time=1567] Where is it?
[time=1570] What do you mean you ate it?
[time=1571] That was mine as the best catch it.
[time=1573] I don't care if you were hungry.
[time=1574] I'm hungry too.
[time=1575] Now listen buddy.
[time=1576] I'm hungry.
[time=1586] 490.
[time=1590] Okay, that's okay John.
[time=1591] If you ate my fish, that's all right.
[time=1594] I forgive you.
[time=1596] This isn't easy to do but I forgive you.
[time=1600] What's that?
[time=1601] Would you call me?
[time=1604] A nincompoop?
[time=1606] You called me a nincompoop?
[time=1608] What gives you the right?
[time=1611] Just a minute.
[time=1616] 491.
[time=1618] John, you don't know how long I've been waiting for this.
[time=1621] Now if that had been the literal meaning of what Jesus said,
[time=1627] we might expect something like that but see the number, the number wasn't the important thing.
[time=1632] In fact in the new international version, the interpretation is you must forgive up to 77 times.
[time=1640] See, the number wasn't significant.
[time=1642] The point Jesus was making is you don't set the limit.
[time=1644] You don't say three.
[time=1645] You don't say seven.
[time=1648] It goes on.
[time=1649] You don't keep count.
[time=1652] How often do you forgive?
[time=1655] As many times as someone hurt you Jesus is saying.
[time=1659] Luke chapter 17, Jesus taught if your brother sins rebuke him.
[time=1662] And if he repents, forgive him.
[time=1664] Now listen to this, if he sins against you seven times in the same day.
[time=1669] And seven times comes back to you and says, I repent, I'm sorry.
[time=1674] You must forgive him.
[time=1679] Now that's not easy to do but there is no limit to the number of times
[time=1687] that we to be willing to forgive.
[time=1692] Yeah, but how far should my forgiveness reach?
[time=1695] I mean even if there's no limits to how often I'm to forgive someone else, certainly there must be limits to how far my forgiveness extends.
[time=1706] I mean what if my neighbor comes and borrows my car once, twice, five times?
[time=1712] And every time he borrows he takes it out and wrecks it.
[time=1714] Does that mean that just because I forgive him I'm obligated on the sixth time to give him the keys to my car again?
[time=1721] Is that forgiveness?
[time=1722] Is that how far forgiveness must reach?
[time=1725] If a friend proves himself unfaithful and keeping secrets that I've entrusted to him,
[time=1732] does forgiveness mean that I have to take the risk of trusting him again?
[time=1738] Do I have to forgive someone even if they're not repentant?
[time=1742] If someone breaks into my home and comes in and harms me or my children, does that mean that we're supposed to forgive him?
[time=1750] Is that what forgiveness means?
[time=1751] And does that forgiveness means that we release him from many legal obligations?
[time=1756] We don't press charges.
[time=1757] I mean didn't Jesus say turn the other cheek?
[time=1760] Is that how far forgiveness should extend?
[time=1764] Hard questions to answer.
[time=1767] Especially when we really want to understand what Jesus wants of us and we want to do it even when it's difficult, but they're hard questions.
[time=1775] I'd like to try to answer the question of how far should my forgiveness reach?
[time=1783] And I think there are some things that can help us understand.
[time=1785] One of the things that can help us answer the question is to understand that I believe there are at least three levels of forgiveness.
[time=1793] And sometimes we get confused because we try to lump them all together, but I think there are three distinct levels of forgiveness.
[time=1799] And if we think of forgiveness as letting go, it might help us understand these three levels.
[time=1804] And the first level of forgiveness is this.
[time=1808] Letting go of resentment.
[time=1813] Now this level of forgiveness is unconditional.
[time=1819] It doesn't have anything to do with what the offender does.
[time=1823] I must forgive regardless of how the offender responds.
[time=1827] It's unconditional.
[time=1829] Never in scripture am I told that I can harbor resentment, bitterness, desire for vengeance, hatred in my heart.
[time=1838] I must always forgive on this level of forgiveness.
[time=1842] I must always be willing to let go of resentment.
[time=1847] Someone says, what about people that don't get along with me?
[time=1851] They don't want to get along with me.
[time=1853] What about people that hate me?
[time=1857] People are looking for ways to mistreat me.
[time=1859] You mean I'm supposed to let go of resentment even for that kind of person?
[time=1862] Yes.
[time=1865] In Luke chapter 6, Jesus said that we were to love our enemies to do good to those that hate you.
[time=1874] Bless those who curse you.
[time=1876] Pray for those who mistreat you.
[time=1879] Kind of forgiveness is unconditional.
[time=1882] You know what?
[time=1883] It goes beyond what is natural or normal for me to do and problem for you too.
[time=1888] I'm just naturally not that way.
[time=1890] There's a book with an interesting title.
[time=1892] The title is this, "Grace is not a blue-eyed blonde." And in that book, there's an interesting quotation that has to do with this area of forgiveness.
[time=1901] The author writes, "When you deal intimately with human beings, you wonder at times if forgiveness is not as rare as hen's teeth." People bury hatchets but carefully tuck away the map which tell where the hidden weapon lies.
[time=1916] We put our resentments in cold storage and then pull the switch to let them thaw out again.
[time=1921] Our grudges are taken out to the lake to drown them.
[time=1924] Even into the lake of prayer, then we end up giving them swimming lessons.
[time=1929] How often have we torn up the cancelled note, but hang on to the waste basket that holds the pieces?
[time=1934] This is not to say that human forgiveness does not occur only that it is rare and that much that passes for forgiveness is often not so at all.
[time=1944] You see, Jesus went on to say in that passage in Luke that if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
[time=1951] I mean, that's what's natural and normal.
[time=1954] That's no credit to us.
[time=1955] He says even sinners love those who love them.
[time=1957] And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you?
[time=1960] Even sinners do that.
[time=1961] And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you?
[time=1965] Even sinners expect them to be repaid in full, but love your enemies, love your enemies, and do good to them.
[time=1975] And lend to them without expecting to get anything back.
[time=1978] Then your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the most high because, listen, because God, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
[time=1987] Be merciful just as your father is merciful.
[time=1991] This releasing of resentment is unconditional.
[time=1995] It's required of us.
[time=1997] And it's not easy.
[time=1999] And sometimes it takes time.
[time=2003] But we must never willingly hold on to resentment.
[time=2006] We must be willing to say, I let it go.
[time=2009] I let it go.
[time=2011] And act according to that decision.
[time=2014] And let God heal the feelings that many times say to you.
[time=2018] That we have no right to hold on to resentment.
[time=2022] That's the first level.
[time=2024] We're required to let go of resentment.
[time=2026] There's another level of forgiveness.
[time=2028] And this level is letting go of the debt.
[time=2031] And by debt, I mean simply any expectation of payment or penalty that we think that someone else has incurred.
[time=2038] When someone does this wrong, many times there's a debt incurred.
[time=2041] And there's an expectation that that be cared for.
[time=2045] The second level of forgiveness releases someone from the debt.
[time=2048] Now I believe this level of forgiveness is conditional.
[time=2053] It's conditional on the repentance of the offender.
[time=2058] If you're in Matthew chapter 18, Jesus began teaching a parable after he'd answered Peter's question.
[time=2065] Let's look at the beginning, the first part of that parable.
[time=2068] Verse 23, "Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle in accounts with his servants." And as he began the settlement, a man who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him.
[time=2080] Now 10,000 talents.
[time=2081] Again, I don't think the mount is significant.
[time=2084] What Jesus is saying, here's a man that owed the king an extraordinary amount of money.
[time=2089] We might say billions of dollars came to him.
[time=2093] Now since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
[time=2100] The servant fell on his knees before him.
[time=2103] Be patient with me, he begged.
[time=2105] I'll pay back everything.
[time=2107] The servant's master took pity on him and canceled the debt and let him go.
[time=2114] The second level of forgiveness, releasing someone from the debt.
[time=2118] This was the condition of the king's forgiveness.
[time=2121] When the man came and bowed before him and asked, please be patient with me.
[time=2125] And the king forgave him of the debt.
[time=2130] I think there are other examples in scripture for repentance as the condition, it was the condition of the churches forgiveness.
[time=2137] Just before this passage, Jesus was talking to the disciples.
[time=2141] And he said, here are the steps to follow when someone sins against you.
[time=2146] First thing you do, go to that person one-on-one.
[time=2152] Talk to them about the offense.
[time=2154] If they listen to you, if they repent, it's over, it's finished, it's done.
[time=2159] If not, go bring one or two others along with you.
[time=2165] Speak to them again.
[time=2167] If he listens to the two or three of you, it's over, it's done.
[time=2172] But if he doesn't repent, you take the matter before the church.
[time=2176] And if the man listens to the church, it's over, it's done, there's forgiveness.
[time=2182] But if he doesn't repent, Jesus says, you treat him as one who is outside of the church.
[time=2190] Repentance was a condition for the church's forgiveness.
[time=2194] Repentance is the condition of God's forgiveness, I believe.
[time=2197] God is a God of forgiveness, we know that's true.
[time=2200] But will God forgive a sinner who doesn't repent?
[time=2203] Does God forgive when there's no repentance?
[time=2205] Can I come to God and say, God, you know, I really done some terrible things.
[time=2211] I mean, really bad stuff.
[time=2213] You know what?
[time=2214] It's been kind of fun.
[time=2215] You know, in fact, I think just when I get done talking with you here, I'm going to go out and do it some more.
[time=2219] But, man, I don't want hell.
[time=2221] I don't want anything bad to happen.
[time=2223] You mind just forgiving me?
[time=2225] See, I don't think God forgives that kind of attitude.
[time=2229] God requires repentance.
[time=2231] It's fairly obvious in the Old Testament.
[time=2235] We see God's dealing with Israel.
[time=2237] But even in the New Testament, we see Matthew 11, 20.
[time=2241] Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent.
[time=2248] In Luke 13, Jesus warned twice.
[time=2250] Unless you repent, you will perish.
[time=2253] And Peter warned the crowds.
[time=2255] Acts chapter 3, repent then and turn to God so that your sins may be wiped out.
[time=2264] Someone offends you, someone sins against you, and a debt is incurred.
[time=2268] You are obligated to not hold resentment.
[time=2272] But in many instances, I don't believe you're obligated to release them from the debt unless there's repentance.
[time=2276] Now, you may choose to do that unconditionally anyway.
[time=2280] You have the right to do that.
[time=2282] You have the right to remove the debt.
[time=2284] If that's in your authority to do that.
[time=2287] But I want to caution you on one thing.
[time=2289] Do that wisely.
[time=2292] When you remove the debt when there has been no repentance, do it wisely.
[time=2298] Because I think there are some dangers when the debt is removed without repentance.
[time=2303] Let me just mention a few of them.
[time=2305] First of all, the offender expects to have his own way.
[time=2309] As parents, many times this happens when we become too lenient with children.
[time=2314] There's disobedience.
[time=2315] They say they're sorry.
[time=2317] Many times it happens.
[time=2319] And we just, well, okay, I forgive you and we just let them go on.
[time=2323] We never let them suffer the consequences for disobedience.
[time=2326] Children grow up thinking that I can have my own way.
[time=2331] The offender does not face responsibility for sin.
[time=2334] The offender does not deal with the seriousness of the offense.
[time=2338] Because even though we have released, let go of the resentment, still many times there's a consequence and a debt that needs to be paid.
[time=2346] If we take that away, many times we're harming the offender more than we're doing good.
[time=2351] And perhaps greatest of all, sometimes we leave people with a sense of false relief.
[time=2355] Oh, I've been forgiven.
[time=2356] When we choose to forgive, yet they don't have the forgiveness of God.
[time=2361] Well, that's the second level, letting go of the debt.
[time=2364] And it's conditional, I believe, on repentance.
[time=2366] The third, the third level, is letting go of distrust.
[time=2372] Because isn't it true that when someone hurts you, when someone sins against you, that there's a breaking of a trust, there's a breaking of relationship?
[time=2380] Does forgiveness mean that I go right back into their relationship and I give my full trust to that person again?
[time=2387] And anything short of that isn't forgiveness?
[time=2389] I don't think so.
[time=2390] I think this third level of forgiveness again has a condition to it.
[time=2394] And the condition is the offender's earned trust.
[time=2400] See, forgiveness on the first level does not necessarily mean that there can be or should be a return of trust.
[time=2407] For example, in the passage, in the parable that we read, the king forgave the debt of the servant.
[time=2413] But he didn't say, "Hold on before you leave.
[time=2415] I want to get another billion dollars and give it to you." Go out and waste that, too.
[time=2421] See, trust takes time.
[time=2426] I have a sister that's a little bit younger than me, about two and a half years younger.
[time=2430] So I was in high school, later high school.
[time=2433] She was coming up through junior high and into high school.
[time=2437] And there's something I heard my sister say over and over again.
[time=2441] And as a parent, perhaps you've heard, if you have teenagers, perhaps you've heard this many times, too.
[time=2447] Why don't you trust me?
[time=2450] You don't trust me.
[time=2451] You said you forgave me, but you don't trust me.
[time=2453] You don't trust me.
[time=2454] How come you don't trust me?
[time=2455] I can't tell you how many times I heard that.
[time=2457] And you know, as older brother, I just kind of laughed inside.
[time=2461] Because it was obvious why they didn't trust her.
[time=2463] She wasn't trustworthy.
[time=2464] My parents forgave her.
[time=2468] When she came and said, "I'm sorry." They forgave her of that.
[time=2472] But when she started doing something once, twice, three times, of course they didn't trust her.
[time=2477] I didn't trust her.
[time=2478] Not too many people who knew or did trust her during that time.
[time=2481] She's much more trustworthy now.
[time=2483] But you know, the question here is why don't you trust me?
[time=2486] Because trust takes time.
[time=2487] And when you break a trust, it takes time to heal again.
[time=2491] That's the condition.
[time=2493] Trust must be earned.
[time=2495] Now again, that doesn't mean that you're obligated to wait until someone earns their trust.
[time=2500] And we put up this high standard of you've got to earn my trust before I'll trust you again.
[time=2505] In fact, sometimes we may choose to unconditionally give our trust to someone who has broken it before.
[time=2511] But again, we must do that wisely.
[time=2515] We can't just go back and handing our trust to someone who has violated it over and over again.
[time=2521] We've got to be wise because there are dangers again.
[time=2524] Dangers of restoring trust before it's earned.
[time=2527] I think one danger is the offender is tempted in a possible area of weakness again.
[time=2532] They're never held an account for it.
[time=2535] And we just entrust them again, and they're tempted again, and they mess up again.
[time=2540] The bank teller starts borrowing some of the cash that she collects behind the window, and she's caught.
[time=2547] She goes to her boss, the president of the bank.
[time=2550] He's a Christian man.
[time=2552] She says, "I'm sorry." He says, "I forgive you." Does that mean he puts her behind the window again?
[time=2559] I don't think so.
[time=2561] Trust needs to be earned.
[time=2563] Another danger is the offender is not given time to prove themselves worthy, and they lack the confidence of others.
[time=2571] There's different levels of forgiveness.
[time=2574] Hope that helps us understand where we are obligated on the first level to forgive.
[time=2580] No question about that.
[time=2582] But there may be times when these different levels of forgiveness, when the debt is still incurred, when the trust still isn't given until conditions are met.
[time=2593] Another thing that may help us answer the question of how far should my forgiveness extend is to understand that there are two different kinds of forgiveness.
[time=2604] Just as there are various levels of forgiveness, I believe there's two different kinds of forgiveness, and understanding the difference in these two kinds helps us not only to learn how to forgive other people, but to understand the way that we need to go to God to have him forgive us.
[time=2622] We can read about this.
[time=2624] So we continue in this parable in Matthew chapter 18, beginning with verse 28.
[time=2630] The servant had been forgiven of his debt.
[time=2632] Verse 28.
[time=2633] When the servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred and every twenty bucks.
[time=2641] He grabbed and began to choke him.
[time=2643] "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.
[time=2645] "I will servant fell to his knees and beg, be patient with me.
[time=2648] I will repay you." That should have sounded familiar, but he refused.
[time=2654] Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.
[time=2658] Now, when the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened, then the master called the servant in.
[time=2667] "You wicked servant," he said.
[time=2668] "I canceled all the debt of yours because you begged me to.
[time=2671] Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?" And in his anger, the master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed.
[time=2680] Now, verse 35.
[time=2681] Is this bother you a little bit?
[time=2683] It says, "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart." That bothers me a little bit.
[time=2693] Does that mean that somehow God can unforgive me?
[time=2699] Does that mean that I can do something that takes away the forgiveness of God, and so I'm left standing guilty before him again?
[time=2707] I think we understand the two different kinds of forgiveness.
[time=2711] It helps us in passages like these to get a proper perspective.
[time=2714] I think one kind of forgiveness that we talk about is a legal forgiveness, and the other forgiveness is a relational forgiveness.
[time=2724] Sometimes we have both at the same time.
[time=2728] Other times we may have one or the other.
[time=2733] Legal forgiveness means that someone releases us from the penalty of violating a law.
[time=2738] We may violate a law of God, we may violate a law of the government, we may violate a law of any authority over us.
[time=2746] When we violate that law and someone comes to us and says, "I'm releasing you from the penalty of violating that law," that's legal forgiveness.
[time=2753] Relational forgiveness means that someone accepts us even after we've hurt them.
[time=2761] It's a change of attitude, and it's possible to have one kind of forgiveness without the other.
[time=2767] Many of us remember in 1974 the scandal that broke out surrounding Watergate and the events that took place around there.
[time=2777] In fact, it came to place in August 9th, Richard Nixon announced he was stepping down from President United States.
[time=2787] In September 8th, newly appointed President Gerald Ford, pardon former President Nixon of any crimes that he might have committed an office.
[time=2798] But you know what?
[time=2799] There are people around the country, many people who still blamed Nixon.
[time=2803] They saw the things that he had done as they felt that those were misuses of his office.
[time=2807] In fact, many political analysts believe that President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon cost in the '76 election.
[time=2814] See, Nixon received legal forgiveness, but in many cases he did not receive relational forgiveness.
[time=2822] You see the difference there?
[time=2824] And it can go the other way too.
[time=2826] Perhaps one of the stories that sticks in my mind most, and it illustrates this point, was of a man and his wife that I met as my father used to travel, lived in Sumter, South Carolina,
[time=2841] and he had the reputation and the community of being a very godly man, a man whose love for Jesus Christ was genuine, had that kind of love that really spilled out of his life and touched other people, George Roland.
[time=2855] George Roland didn't marry for quite some time, but as he got along later in years, he found a woman that was quite a bit younger than himself, but he loved her.
[time=2865] She loved him, and they were married.
[time=2868] And the love relationship those two had was obvious to people that knew them.
[time=2874] It was a neat thing to see.
[time=2877] The Roland's lived outside of the city.
[time=2879] It was a secluded private home.
[time=2881] I remember visiting the home and walking out back.
[time=2884] The property was on the edge of the lake.
[time=2887] Couldn't see any other houses around.
[time=2889] It was kind of a swampy kind of lake with little water ways working through tufts of vegetation that grew up around large trees lined the shoreline, even some of the trees growing up away from the shore up through the water.
[time=2902] And built on the shore and reaching out into the water was a long dock that reached out into the shallow water.
[time=2908] And at the end of the dock was tied a small boat.
[time=2911] And I enjoyed as a young child running up and down the length of that dock.
[time=2918] A little later after we had visited, I heard my parents talking about a situation that happened with the Roland's.
[time=2925] And since then, I've talked to them about it.
[time=2929] One day when Mr. Roland was gone, his young wife decided to go out into the boat for a while in the afternoon.
[time=2937] She walked to the end of the dock and stepped into the boat, began working yours back and forth in the boat, moved across the top of the water.
[time=2946] And she was out into the lake through one of the waterways came another boat.
[time=2951] And then the boat were two men.
[time=2954] When the men came around the corridor and looked off and saw the other boat with the woman in it, they hesitated, they stopped, they talked among themselves, and they started paddling towards her.
[time=2964] There's nothing she could do.
[time=2965] No one was around that could help her even if she screamed.
[time=2969] She couldn't out-row them even though she tried.
[time=2972] And pretty soon they caught up to her boat.
[time=2976] And they both took their turns with her twice raped and beaten.
[time=2983] I know when George heard the news of what had happened to his wife, he was broken.
[time=2990] His love had been hurt.
[time=2993] And it was the kind of hurt that just wasn't physical.
[time=2996] It was the kind of hurt that reached into her soul.
[time=3000] And it reached into his soul too, because when those men raped his wife, they violated George as well.
[time=3008] And I imagine that the pain he felt was probably greater than any pain he'd felt before.
[time=3014] And certainly greater than any pain I've ever been through.
[time=3019] But you know what?
[time=3021] The love of God and the life of George was stronger even than that pain he felt.
[time=3028] When those two men were captured and put into jail, George went to visit them in jail.
[time=3032] And he sat down with those men behind the bars, and he started sharing with them about the love and the forgiveness of God.
[time=3042] And before he left that jail cell, George Roland forgave those
[time=3048] two men.
[time=3052] That was a relational forgiveness.
[time=3054] It was great.
[time=3057] I believe it was an awesome, tremendous kind of forgiveness.
[time=3060] It was godly.
[time=3062] But you know something as great as that forgiveness was.
[time=3067] It didn't remove the legal consequences those men had to face.
[time=3072] It would have been foolish to have said, "I forgive you for this.
[time=3078] We're opening the jail doors.
[time=3080] You men are free to go." They stood trial.
[time=3083] They went to prison.
[time=3085] They experienced relational forgiveness, but not legal forgiveness.
[time=3089] You see the difference?
[time=3091] Now, how does God forgive us?
[time=3094] God has given us legal forgiveness.
[time=3097] Jesus paid the penalty for my sin when he died on the cross.
[time=3100] And when I recognize that Jesus Christ is the only acceptable sacrifice for my sin, and I trust my light to him, the Bible says God legally forgives my sin.
[time=3112] Forgives it all, past, present, and future.
[time=3116] All of it, the choir saying the song, "It is well with my soul." One of the verses of that song, "Give the picture this so well." When the author writes, "My sin," oh, the bliss of this glorious thought, "My sin, not in part but the whole, was nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more.
[time=3134] It is well with my soul." You see, I don't have to worry about when I sin later today or tomorrow.
[time=3142] I don't have to worry that when I walk out of this building and a thought comes into my mind that's wrong, or a word slips out that isn't right, or I do something that is sin.
[time=3152] And before I can confess that, I get into my car and I drive out on a state street and someone come the other way, smashes into my car and I'm dead.
[time=3160] I don't have to worry that, oh no, there was unconfessed sin.
[time=3164] Not forgiven.
[time=3166] I'll be under the judgment of God.
[time=3168] No, it's already been forgiven.
[time=3170] God's legal forgiveness has covered that once and for all.
[time=3175] Nothing more to be done.
[time=3179] Do I need to keep asking God to forgive my sin?
[time=3183] And why did Jesus say we were to pray like this?
[time=3185] Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
[time=3191] Why do you mean by that?
[time=3193] Well, I think the confusion comes clearer when we understand the distinction between legal forgiveness that God has already given and the relational forgiveness that I constantly require.
[time=3205] When I disobey God, that sin comes between our relationship.
[time=3208] It doesn't make me guilty.
[time=3210] I stand in the righteousness of Christ.
[time=3212] But it comes between the relationship, my Heavenly Father, and it needs to be taken care of.
[time=3217] There's a relational forgiveness that has to take place just like in the relationship with my earthly Father.
[time=3223] Many times a relational forgiveness had to take place there.
[time=3226] When I would do something, some act of disobedience, I disobey my Father.
[time=3230] I knew my Father still loved me.
[time=3232] I knew my Father wasn't going to run out and somehow try to disown me as a son.
[time=3237] I knew he cared for me.
[time=3239] I knew he was ready to forgive me.
[time=3242] But there was a tear in the relationship.
[time=3244] There was something that came between us and I had to go to my dad and say, "I'm sorry." The relationship was restored.
[time=3250] That's relational forgiveness.
[time=3251] And that's what we required of us because sin hinders our relationship with God.
[time=3255] God's legal forgiveness is once and for all.
[time=3258] Relational forgiveness is what we need from Him every day.
[time=3264] The question of how many times should I forgive?
[time=3269] Constantly.
[time=3270] As often as it's needed.
[time=3271] How far should my forgiveness reach?
[time=3274] On the first level it needs to reach as far as we are hurt.
[time=3279] There's another question.
[time=3284] How deeply should I forgive?
[time=3288] We are to forgive sincerely.
[time=3290] You see what it says in verse 35.
[time=3292] This is how my Heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.
[time=3297] We must forgive sincerely from the heart.
[time=3302] It can't be the superficial kind.
[time=3304] Not the surface kind.
[time=3305] Not the kind of forgiveness that kind of sweeps things under the rug.
[time=3308] It leaves a little bump there and every time we walk by we kind of trip over it.
[time=3312] It's still there.
[time=3314] Not the kind who has carefully made videotapes of all the ways we've been offended by someone in the past.
[time=3321] And we say, "Oh, I forgive you.
[time=3322] I'm going to put the tape back on the shelf." And we leave it back there on the shelf of our mind until the next time it's needed.
[time=3328] And we take it down, stick it back in, play it through again.
[time=3333] That's not sincere.
[time=3335] We need sincere, real, heartfelt, final forgiveness.
[time=3341] Where's the resentment in your heart?
[time=3344] Where's the resentment in your heart for someone else?
[time=3346] You've got to get rid of it.
[time=3349] See, as long as you hold on to it, you're in the torture chamber.
[time=3354] Resitment is the whip that falls over and over again across our back.
[time=3358] Resitment is the screw that tightens itself into our thumbs.
[time=3363] Resitment is the chains that bind us and pull us apart.
[time=3372] An unforgiving person is a tortured person.
[time=3377] Where's the list of wrongs that someone has done to you?
[time=3381] Can you see it there?
[time=3382] Some of you can.
[time=3384] Some of you in your mind, against that someone that you hold resentment for, you can list off the reasons why you have the right to be resentful.
[time=3394] Why you have the right to seek vengeance.
[time=3396] Do you see the list?
[time=3398] You need to take it.
[time=3400] You need to tear it up.
[time=3401] You need to give it back to God.
[time=3403] You need to let go.
[time=3405] And I know that's not easy.
[time=3407] I'm not trying to be so flipping about this to say, "Well, no matter how deeply you've been hurt, just forget it.
[time=3411] Just let it go." I know that's not easy.
[time=3414] But we are obligated to let go of resentment and to act in a way of forgiveness.
[time=3420] To not act according to anger, not act according to hate, not act according to vengeance, according to resentment, act according to forgiveness.
[time=3430] And in time, I believe God will even heal the feelings that still crop up in our heart.
[time=3437] How can we help but do anything about that?
[time=3440] How can we help but forgive in that way when we realize how much God the Father has forgiven us?
[time=3449] Do you realize that no matter how many times someone has offended you over and over and over again,
[time=3455] it cannot compare at all.
[time=3457] Not minutely with the measure of forgiveness that God has had to give you.
[time=3465] With the times and times again that you have offended God, offended Him, sinned against Him.
[time=3474] Yet God reaches out to forgive you.
[time=3478] How can you refuse?
[time=3480] Perhaps it's because you don't know that kind of forgiveness.
[time=3483] God offers through Jesus Christ.
[time=3485] It's available to you.
[time=3489] If we experience that kind of forgiveness of God, then we are required to reach out to others
[time=3496] and offer the same kind of forgiveness in return.
[time=3500] It's been a delight today to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir,
[time=3518] the duet by Dennis Kirschner and Ron Hackett and soloist Joni King.
[time=3523] The message today was from our youth pastor Tim Teder.
[time=3527] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, just before we close, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3535] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3538] Dear Heavenly Father, I've come to the point in my life that I realize that I'm a sinner and need a Savior.
[time=3546] I've committed sins that I cannot resolve on my own, and I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be the Savior of my life.
[time=3557] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3566] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3575] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance," the pamphlet entitled "Faith of Our Fathers," or the devotional guide "Closer Walk," please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East-State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
