[time=0] Our Father in Heaven, we've gathered this morning because we, as bread,
[time=30] we've gathered this morning because we've gathered this morning because we've gathered this morning.
[time=60] We've gathered this morning because we've gathered this morning because we've gathered this morning because we've gathered this morning because we've gathered this morning.
[time=90] [beep]
[time=110] Often we struggle to tell the truth for fear of the consequences.
[time=116] Life is an endless game of truth or consequences.
[time=120] One Father was trying to instruct his son on always telling him the truth.
[time=125] So he told him the story of how George Washington had chopped down his dad's favorite cherry tree.
[time=131] But when confronted, confessed and said, "I cannot tell a lie. Yes, Father, I cut your tree down."
[time=139] Some time later, the little boy was confronted by his own father. His father said, "Son, were you shooting your shotgun at the outhouse?"
[time=148] The little boy remembered George Washington and said, "Father, I cannot tell a lie. I did." And immediately the father gave him the whipping of his life.
[time=157] The little boy said, "Dad, I thought if I told the truth like George Washington, you'd be proud of me and not punish me."
[time=163] The father replied, "Son, George Washington's father wasn't sitting in the cherry tree when he cut it down."
[time=185] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled, "The Legacy of a Father."
[time=193] Today Rick is beginning a three-part series on the theme, "In Search of Honesty." This story a moment ago, humorously illustrates the dilemma that often accompanies being honest.
[time=203] Like the old television show, life often confronts us with truth and consequences.
[time=209] It seems that we daily hear of a player on the wall diamond, a politician in government, or a preacher on television who has made the news for a lack of honesty.
[time=217] Join us today in this practical study of the scriptures.
[time=221] The ladies' chorus will be ministering to us in song.
[time=226] Other special music includes a solo from Marcia Peterson and a song from Rejoice.
[time=233] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=241] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=246] Now, here's Rick.
[time=249] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=252] We do welcome you this morning to our worship service and trust God will use this day in everyone's life,
[time=259] but particularly in the lives of our men to strengthen our commitment to serving Jesus Christ and to being a godly leader in the home.
[time=268] We also welcome our friends who join us by way of television and trust that the Bible Hour will be a strength to the lives of people who are not able to be here with us, perhaps in a hospital room, a nursing home, or wherever they're watching.
[time=281] We hope that God uses this hour to draw each of us closer to Jesus Christ and our purpose is to glorify Him.
[time=289] Because it's Father's Day, our ladies are ministering to us, and so we have a ladies choir today and they're singing of the glorious love of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=311] In my darkness, Jesus found me, touched my eyes and made me see.
[time=321] Prove since chains that long have found me, gave me life and liberty.
[time=333] Oh, the glorious love of Christ will be born and made into to save us all by God.
[time=345] Through all my days and then in my heart.
[time=351] I hope the silence never, our worship in forever, and praise Him for His glorious love.
[time=366] Oh, amazing truth to ponder.
[time=372] He who angels of certain, Lord of them that some might wonder.
[time=383] He became a singer's friend.
[time=389] Oh, glorious love of Christ will be born and made into to save us all by God.
[time=401] Through all my days and then in my heart.
[time=407] I hope the silence never, our worship in forever, and praise Him for His glorious love.
[time=430] And praise Him for His glorious love.
[time=460] We are indeed thankful for the love of the Lord and giving His Son Jesus Christ to die
[time=468] on the cross for our sins, and we're thankful for the ladies that have joined with us today to minister to you all.
[time=474] I hope they were a blessing to your heart.
[time=476] Let's continue to rejoice in the love of Jesus as we sing Him number 529 as a personal testimony.
[time=482] Oh, how I love Jesus, Him number 529, we'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=512] It's not like music in my ear, 'cause she will stay on her.
[time=520] Oh, how I love Jesus, oh, how I love Jesus, oh, how I love Jesus.
[time=531] We've got Him on a spot for me, it tells me of my Father, how He spoke for every day.
[time=545] And though I tear the hearts of Him, it's such a whole way.
[time=553] Oh, how I love Jesus, oh, how I love Jesus, we've got Him on a spot for me.
[time=570] It tells me of my Father, how He spoke for every day.
[time=585] Oh, how I love Jesus, oh, how I love Jesus, oh, how I love Jesus.
[time=599] We've got Him on a spot for every day.
[time=604] Oh, how I love Jesus, oh, how I love Jesus, oh, how I love Jesus.
[time=617] We've got Him on a spot for every day.
[time=625] Thank you very much for your singing, we appreciate it when you join with us and sing so well.
[time=630] Oftentimes, we have people that have been actively involved in our music program, and for one reason or another, they move away.
[time=637] We're also glad when they come back and we hear of their visit to Fort Wayne.
[time=641] Recently, we heard that Marsha Ives Peterson was coming back to Fort Wayne, we always enjoy her music,
[time=647] and we're glad that she's here this morning to minister to us.
[time=650] Let's listen as she does that right now.
[time=653] [MUSIC]
[time=668] Oh, man may strive to go beyond the river's face, to far beyond the distant blimmering stars.
[time=686] This world's a room so smooth in my master's hands.
[time=696] The open sky, what a portion of is yours.
[time=707] I'll be this God, how big and wide His master is.
[time=718] To try to tell these lips can only start.
[time=727] He's big enough to rise by today.
[time=736] If slowly enough to live within my heart.
[time=745] [MUSIC]
[time=759] As winter's chill may cause the tiny sea to fall.
[time=768] To lie asleep till weaked by summer's rain.
[time=776] The heart, grown cold, will warm and thrive with life anew.
[time=786] The master's touch will bring the glow again.
[time=797] How big is God, how big and wide His master may.
[time=807] To try to tell these lips can only start.
[time=816] He's big enough to live His mighty universe.
[time=825] It's falling off to live within my heart.
[time=842] [MUSIC]
[time=850] Today is Father's Day here at Blackhawk and we want to welcome you to the Bible Our Family today.
[time=857] Pete, there's a special someone I know you would like to say Happy Father's Day to in California.
[time=863] Just a few weeks ago, Rick, we had the privilege of saying hello to my mother and that we love her.
[time=868] This is the day when it's really very special to be on television in California and be able to say hello to my father and tell him, Dad, I really love you.
[time=877] Appreciate the ministry that you've had not only in my life but in all of the churches that you've worked in
[time=883] probably for some 40 years now, Rick.
[time=885] And still going strong, I understand.
[time=887] He still preaches.
[time=888] We talked to him this week and he was in Sonoma, California and the church there.
[time=892] And of course, prior to his preaching, he mentioned that the Bible Our was on in that area and that the people should be sure and watch.
[time=898] Oh, he's a good ambassador not only for the Lord but for us as well.
[time=902] We certainly wish all of the men a Happy Father's Day and trust that God will strengthen your commitment to being a father,
[time=909] whether you have little children or grown sons, the impact of your life continues.
[time=915] We want to encourage you friends who are in the Fort Wayne area within a reasonable driving distance to join us for the summer Bible Conference.
[time=923] Coming on Wednesday, June 28th is a great speaker by the name of Bruce Dunn.
[time=931] Bruce will be here to speak in our new worship center at seven o'clock on June the 28th.
[time=936] Many of you have heard him because he has a great radio ministry that goes well beyond his home church
[time=943] and community of Peoria, Illinois extends here to Fort Wayne of course and we're looking forward to him being here in person.
[time=950] And so we want to invite you to join us for the summer Bible Conference with Pastor Bruce Dunn.
[time=956] And then a great musical event, a tribute to America is coming with the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=962] Yes, Rick, we always look forward to this time of the year and we invite all of you that are watching to come and join us on July 2nd at four o'clock at the Black Hawk Worship Center.
[time=971] We're putting on the Patriotic Panorama and calling it Look Up America.
[time=976] And Rick will have the Sounds Alive returning. They haven't sung for some 12 years.
[time=980] They live in five different states. They live in Alaska, California, Texas, Michigan and Indiana.
[time=986] And those nine people will be coming back for a special program that day and it's going to be exciting.
[time=993] I'm glad to see them all again and we'll have a great time of reunion during that weekend.
[time=998] Well, some of the old-time Bible our viewers may well remember the Sounds Alive and I am one of them and looking forward to their ministry back here again.
[time=1007] We're always thankful, too, that the Sanctuary Choir prepares some great numbers.
[time=1011] They have a great arrangement of the Battle of Him of the Republic, a great slide program with the music I Love America.
[time=1017] And then we're going to have a tribute, too, to our presidents, Rick.
[time=1020] Well, being a history major back in college, I remember that for the first 13 years of our nation, we did not have the presidency.
[time=1029] We operated under what we called the Articles of Confederation and it was in 1789 that George Washington became our first president.
[time=1037] So this is the 200th anniversary of the Office of President here in the United States from George to George.
[time=1045] And we'll be reflecting back on the presidents our country has had.
[time=1049] So we hope you'll come and join us.
[time=1051] Again, that is July the 2nd for the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1055] And there's a picnic to follow.
[time=1057] Yes, Rick, we have a good time of fellowship.
[time=1059] Our family's grown quite a bit here at Blackhawk, but there are a few things that just kind of make it a close-knit group.
[time=1065] And right after the Patriotic Panorama, we'll be having a picnic right in our own backyard.
[time=1070] Well, we did that last year and I think the temperature last year was at least 99, if not 100.
[time=1077] I'm sure it was at least that warm.
[time=1078] And in spite of that, everybody who had planned on it came and had just a great time.
[time=1083] Well, there's something about the families getting together with the kids in balloons and ice cream and fried chicken that just makes a picnic a great time.
[time=1091] These are the good old days.
[time=1093] Right.
[time=1094] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to encourage you to not only join us weekly for a study of God's Word.
[time=1102] But to make that a daily habit in your private life, to study God's Word.
[time=1108] Many of us struggle with the discipline that it takes to regularly open up our Bible.
[time=1113] Many of us struggle because we don't know where should we be reading and then if we do read it, do we always have the right understanding?
[time=1122] We have a little tool that will help with all of those problems.
[time=1126] It's called A Closer Walk. It's a daily reading guide that takes us through the New Testament in one year.
[time=1133] When you open up its pages, you discover that it not only gives you a selected passage of the New Testament to read, but a timeless insight.
[time=1143] Some teaching, some application from one of God's great ambassadors of present days or years gone by who will apply God's Word rightly to our hearts.
[time=1154] We'd like to send you a copy as a gift from us to you to give you that little nudge that you may need to be faithfully studying God's Word.
[time=1162] You can receive Closer Walk by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana. The zip code is 46815.
[time=1173] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1182] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1188] When others see with early eyes, just what they want to see, you will see the things that never die.
[time=1212] You will know and recognize by a simple child and name, that Christ was true that others will deny.
[time=1228] We'd rather say, "I'm just a man who might you breathe these dreams."
[time=1238] We're others, more than people might be.
[time=1245] You'll listen for eternity, the moments have saved us.
[time=1254] And see with spirit eyes, what others miss.
[time=1261] Upon this rock, I'll build my kingdom.
[time=1269] Upon this rock, forever and ever, it shall stand.
[time=1276] And all the foes of hell is hell. She'll never more prevail against it.
[time=1285] For status grows, our built-on seeking strength.
[time=1292] Upon this rock, I'll build my kingdom.
[time=1300] And on this rock, forever and ever, it shall stand.
[time=1307] Upon this rock of revelation, I'll build a strong and mighty nation.
[time=1316] And it will stand the storms of time upon this rock.
[time=1326] Within a simple coffin turn, you'll see the sun upon.
[time=1335] If you will choose to lose when you could win.
[time=1343] If you will give your life away for nothing in return,
[time=1351] then you are where my kingdom will begin.
[time=1358] Upon this rock, I'll build my kingdom.
[time=1366] Upon this rock, forever and ever, it shall stand.
[time=1373] And all the foes of hell is hell. She'll never more prevail against it.
[time=1382] For status grows, our built-on seeking strength.
[time=1389] Upon this rock, I'll build my kingdom.
[time=1397] And on this rock, forever and ever, it shall stand.
[time=1404] Upon this rock of revelation, I'll build a strong and mighty nation.
[time=1412] And it will stand the storms of time upon this rock.
[time=1420] Upon this rock of revelation, I'll build a strong and mighty nation.
[time=1428] And it will stand the storms of time upon this rock.
[time=1442] I'll build my church, my church, upon this rock.
[time=1457] I'll build my church, upon this rock, upon this rock.
[time=1474] Thank you, ladies.
[time=1475] It is the promise of Jesus Christ that he would establish his church.
[time=1480] Well, not this church and not any building, but to establish a body of people who would believe in him
[time=1487] that would be undaunted and unshaken throughout history, that nothing, including all the hell and Satan could throw against it, it would stand.
[time=1497] And that is our confidence today.
[time=1500] And I invite you now to pray with that confidence.
[time=1504] Our God, we would ask you today to use that song to strengthen the hearts of believers who would be tossed and shaken by the raging waves of life turmoil.
[time=1516] We would pray today that there would come a confidence in the strength and the heart of men and women
[time=1522] who are walking through the tough times.
[time=1525] We'd pray for friends today who are battling cancer for Catherine Northrup, Jack Saylor,
[time=1532] Lorraine Summer, and our Dean Marker, that you would give wisdom to them and the choices that they will have to make
[time=1538] in days ahead, that you'll give wisdom to their doctors and strength to their physical bodies,
[time=1544] and we'd particularly pray for recovery.
[time=1548] We'd pray today for those who are facing the enemy of rejection, that you'll help them first and foremost to sense their security in your love, that they might know today that you love them and care about them.
[time=1562] Help them not to grow bitter, but to remain winsome.
[time=1568] We pray that you would turn the hearts of fathers on this day towards home.
[time=1574] We pray that men would have an increased appetite for spiritual food,
[time=1581] that they would turn to your word and they would seek to please you.
[time=1586] Father, I ask you to begin with me and then give to all of us as men a desire to be committed to our families more than we are committed to our fortune
[time=1598] and to be faithful to our wives and to our children more than following our calling in the workplace.
[time=1606] We want to please you.
[time=1608] We would ask you today to put that dimension of spiritual hunger in our hearts.
[time=1615] We would pray today for our church that as a body of people we would be undaunted and unshaken
[time=1621] by a world of compromise.
[time=1624] We would ask that you would give us first and foremost a driving desire for obedience.
[time=1631] Give us sharp instincts for truth.
[time=1634] Give us nagging consciences when we consider our own wayward steps.
[time=1644] And Father, we pray that you would give us energy as workers, that you would multiply the number of people who would be willing to leave this church to go into missions,
[time=1654] that you would increase the number of people who would make sharing Christ in this town a chief priority.
[time=1662] And then we pray that you would give us financial blessing that we might focus on ministry and not funding the ministry.
[time=1670] And today as we open up your word, give us today.
[time=1673] Eyes and ears to hear not what a man, a preacher, me has to say.
[time=1681] But give us ears to hear your spirit.
[time=1685] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1697] I know regrets that I said just to Jesus.
[time=1705] That when he called, I answered him that day.
[time=1714] I know regrets that I became a Christian.
[time=1723] And to make him sick to Abraham.
[time=1731] No regrets, regrets.
[time=1740] For the cup of life is filled up to the breeze.
[time=1749] Sweet peace is mine and joy that can't be pressured.
[time=1757] I know regrets that I chose to follow you.
[time=1775] I know regrets I left my old companion.
[time=1783] Who scored the Lord and lived for things of her.
[time=1792] I know regrets that now I'm serving Jesus.
[time=1800] To be His friendship is greater.
[time=1809] I know regrets I've suffered some more Jesus.
[time=1818] Have known something, have wept so bitter tears.
[time=1826] I know regrets for when it always led me.
[time=1835] To trust His will removes my doubts and dreams.
[time=1843] No regrets, I know regrets.
[time=1852] It's been heaven just to walk within each day.
[time=1861] And besides, when face to face up there I see.
[time=1869] All the trials of life and labor here we play.
[time=1880] I know regrets I chose to follow you.
[time=1907] Thank you, Marcia and all the ladies who made this a special Father's Day by singing for us
[time=1913] and to us and teaching us God's principles in music.
[time=1918] Today I'd like to begin a three-part series of messages on something that is seemingly dominating the news these days.
[time=1927] Tiananmen Square, Strongman Manuel Noriega, the death of the Ayatollah have all been headline events.
[time=1936] But it seems the reoccurring and chronic issue of the news is the lack of integrity that is permeating every dimension of our society.
[time=1949] And so we will be looking at a question of ethics in search of honesty.
[time=1956] As we look at the news over the past decades and even recent weeks we find the reoccurring theme of is there any honesty in government.
[time=1965] We go back almost two decades now and we come to those familiar household words of Watergate followed by Amsterdam, now followed by a Rand Gate.
[time=1977] We have said goodbye to Jim Wright and we never did say hello to John Tower.
[time=1984] And now the question of ethics is is it proper to question the ethics?
[time=1989] Or is it all just politics and we ought not to question the ethics of our leaders?
[time=1996] As we read the news we are now discovering that there may be $100 million or more missing
[time=2003] and Jack Kemp gets the lucky job of hunting through that.
[time=2007] Past administrations were judged on their sleaze factor.
[time=2011] Webtech went as high as the highest man of jurisprudence in our land, the Attorney General.
[time=2018] We look at our government and we are saying is there an integrity problem?
[time=2023] But more than government, what could be more American than hot dogs, apple pie and baseball?
[time=2032] And recently problems have occurred in baseball. You can bet on it.
[time=2040] Let me go back a couple of years ago when bats were the problems.
[time=2045] A young man by the name of Billy Hatcher took his bat and he connected an Astro drone.
[time=2051] His bat hit the ball dead center and it exploded his bat on impact, spilling cork under the Astro turf of the Astro dome.
[time=2062] Then this news article came with all of the seriousness and concern of an expecting father in a waiting room.
[time=2072] On the morning of August the 7th, 1987, a battery of X-ray was run in the diagnostic unit of the executive health examiners in Manhattan.
[time=2087] Outside of the emergency procedure waited five nervous men on the 21st floor of the radiology room.
[time=2097] While technicians inside went through their paces.
[time=2102] When the film was processed and the pictures flashed on a bright light box for study, it was discovered that the X-rays were negative.
[time=2116] Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. New York Mets, third baseman Howard Johnson's bat was indeed a solid piece of wood.
[time=2129] Phil Nicro is one of the all-time great pitchers in baseball. But at age 42, temptation overcame him.
[time=2137] He threw a particularly wicked curve ball. One too good to be true thought the umpire and he called for the ball
[time=2145] and he retreated from the catcher. There was a very pronounced scuff mark on this otherwise brand new ball.
[time=2153] The umpire approached the mound and in front of 33,000 people the examination was conducted.
[time=2160] Inside his pocket they discovered a piece of sandpaper and an emery board.
[time=2167] Inside the pocket of the umpire were six balls that he had already collected from Phil's pitching that day.
[time=2177] There's not much honesty in sports, even good old baseball.
[time=2181] In basketball the news instead of talking about high points, slam dungs and draft choices has been dominated by recruiting violations,
[time=2190] drugs, steroids, gambling, brawling and lack of academic records. Someone asked this question.
[time=2198] Do you know how many University of Nevada at Las Vegas basketball players it takes to change a light bulb?
[time=2207] It only takes one but he gets four hours credit each semester.
[time=2213] There's not much honesty in sports. This headline probably was more familiar than most of us would like it to be.
[time=2223] March 13th, 1989, Sports Illustrated title, "A dirty coach comes clean."
[time=2233] Charlie Francis reversed fields and testified in Toronto that Ben Johnson had indeed been using steroids since 1981.
[time=2246] And it was just, I believe, Friday of this week that the news carried that Johnson himself now admits that.
[time=2254] But business is no different than sports or politics. Contractors are now coming clean, having been caught.
[time=2266] A vast violations in the hundreds of millions of dollars, defense contractors who had cheated the United States government out of millions and millions of millions.
[time=2283] The name Ivan Bolsky has become as common as any star athlete in our era.
[time=2292] Junk bonds have flooded the market. Insider trading has become the watchword of Wall Street, a lack of integrity and honesty in business.
[time=2304] The military, our greatest enemy is not those out there but those of us in here who will sell secret to those who are out there.
[time=2315] And the whole phrase is appalling. Sex for secrets with the Soviets.
[time=2323] But religion is no different. We all know the stories of Baker and Swagert but it's tragically common, not exceptional.
[time=2332] Years ago somebody wrote an exposé of one television ministry called "Give Me That Prime Time Religion."
[time=2339] It was an exposé of all of the things that you would not want to find inside your church.
[time=2346] What most people don't know is the story about another prime time television ministry where the man stood in front of the Great Wall.
[time=2355] His picture was taken and a letter was sent out to his audience saying, "Please send us funds. We're in desperate need of your help to reach China."
[time=2364] It was later discovered he had never been to China. It was a mural of the Great Wall in front. He stood in front of.
[time=2372] A number of us took a tour of another large television ministry and we went through their mailroom.
[time=2378] Just getting ideas on how they processed mail so quickly and there we found a box and we looked in it.
[time=2383] It said, "Dear Charlie, your name came to my heart today and I prayed for you personally." Dear Harry, your name came to my heart today. I prayed for you personally.
[time=2392] Dear Fred, your name came to my heart and I prayed for you today personally.
[time=2395] Dear Wilma, dear Barney, dear Betty, dear Dino, dear Bam Bam, I mean it went through box after box after box after box.
[time=2404] The message was, "I thought of you personally and that person never even saw the mailroom."
[time=2410] Religion ministry. We're not head and shoulders above anybody.
[time=2418] But unless you think it's just the leaders of the land integrity and honesty is a grassroots problem.
[time=2426] Just about a week ago on 2020, John Stossel gave a report on honesty.
[time=2430] He told the story of Columbus, Ohio, where a man driving an armored car went down a freeway and over a million dollars spilled out the back.
[time=2438] Guess who's unemployed. But the real problem was the people who stopped traffic to run out and stuff their pockets full of money.
[time=2447] Columbus launched an honesty campaign and the first recipient of honor was the man who came forward with over $50,000 he collected on the freeway.
[time=2457] And in that honest city, 75% of the money has still remained in the hands of the people who collected it.
[time=2467] The odds are that if you lose money, you have a one in four chance of getting it back.
[time=2473] One man lost his billfold and said in the newspaper, lost billfold, name listed and said, "All I really want back are the pictures."
[time=2481] Washington, Lincoln, Hamilton, Jackson, Grant. Not much chance of getting that back, not in our country today.
[time=2494] This article was in Time Magazine two years ago. It's called "Gilt," settling it with Uncle Sam.
[time=2501] One donation for 44 cents came from a woman who confessed to reusing two postage stamps.
[time=2508] A gift of $2,000 came from an anonymous donor who wanted to clear his conscience, quote, "with the IRS and with God."
[time=2518] The largest deposit, $50,000 from a man who gave no reason for sending the money, helped to set a new record for contributions to the federal government's, quote, "conscience fund," end quote.
[time=2532] The amount made up of donations from guilt-ridden citizens in 1986 tallied $380,929.
[time=2544] The largest in any year in the 175 year history of the guilt fund.
[time=2552] To date, $5,700,000 has been turned in anonymously to the IRS.
[time=2562] Those are just the people who felt guilty enough to reimburse the government.
[time=2568] It is a grassroots problem. Here are the three greatest lies of all time.
[time=2574] Lie number three. I'm glad you called. I was trying to reach you.
[time=2581] Lie number two. The checks in the mail.
[time=2585] Lie number one. If I've never used lie number two or three in my life, honesty and integrity is a real grassroots problem.
[time=2597] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it to Exodus, the second book of the Bible.
[time=2602] Genesis, then Exodus, chapter 20, and we'll look at just a couple verses in this most familiar of Old Testament passages.
[time=2614] Exodus 20 brings to us what we more familiarly call the Ten Commandments.
[time=2622] And in the Ten Commandments, we are introduced to the law of God.
[time=2627] If you want a simple outline for what we're going to look at today, we're going to look at the law of God and the legacy of a father.
[time=2635] In the Ten Commandments, we are greeted with one specific instruction about honesty.
[time=2642] It's found in verse 16. It says, "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor."
[time=2655] The books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy give us God's law and then they rephrase it and they give it again and again.
[time=2664] In Exodus 19, 11, it says, "Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not deceive one another."
[time=2673] It sounds so simple to be trite.
[time=2676] And yet it may be the greatest academic proportionate problem we're facing in our world today is anybody honest.
[time=2687] And sometimes we have to set the record simply straight from the beginning.
[time=2693] God has said it, "Thou shall not lie."
[time=2699] The book of Proverbs gives great practical insight both from a human perspective and from a divine.
[time=2706] We see it from not only our angle but from God's.
[time=2709] Allow me to share three Proverbs with you.
[time=2712] Proverbs 12.19 gives us this insight.
[time=2716] "Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment."
[time=2734] You see, the temptation to lie is actually a temptation of the immediate.
[time=2740] It's our fear that if I tell the truth, I will suffer from consequences.
[time=2745] It's the truth in consequences dilemma.
[time=2749] But if I lie, perhaps I could cover it up.
[time=2753] Father was trying to teach his son the value of always telling the truth and the consequences may be even averted by the truth.
[time=2764] So he tells him the story of how George Washington chopped down his father's favorite cherry tree.
[time=2771] Upon George's father's discovery, he confronts young Washington.
[time=2777] George, did you chop down my favorite cherry tree?
[time=2784] To which the Sunday to be president responded, "Father, I cannot tell a lie. I did."
[time=2791] The man went on to explain to his son that George's father didn't punish him because he told the truth.
[time=2797] Some time went by and the father came back to his son with an angry look and crossed arms and said,
[time=2804] "Son, were you shooting your shotgun at the family outhouse?" Remembering the story of George Washington, he proudly said, "Father, I cannot tell a lie. Yes, I did."
[time=2817] The father gave him the worst punishment of his life.
[time=2821] The boy said, "Dad, I told the truth like George Washington. I wouldn't be punished."
[time=2827] The father explained further, "Son, George Washington's father was not in that cherry tree when he cut it down."
[time=2838] Truth and consequences. The temptation to lie is the fear that if I tell the truth, I may get caught.
[time=2849] Mark Twain had a wonderful way of expressing principles out of usually Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn.
[time=2855] Huck had told one line to cover it another and then a third to cover the second and the fourth to cover that one.
[time=2861] And he had got himself into a truth and finally Huck says, "There tought nothing I could do but tell the truth."
[time=2868] And it seemed to might risk you having never done it before.
[time=2873] There's a lot of risk in telling the truth.
[time=2878] The Bible here says, "Yes, there's that immediate temptation to cover it up, but it only lasts for a moment."
[time=2888] The beauty about the truth is you never have to remember what you said.
[time=2893] Wherewith a lie you have to keep constantly rechecking the files of your mind.
[time=2899] Have I been caught yet?
[time=2901] Proverbs 21 verse 6 gives us a second insight on telling the truth.
[time=2908] A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.
[time=2916] The first reason why we usually fail to be honest is an attempt to cover up for the moment.
[time=2924] A second reason is an attempt to get ahead.
[time=2928] If we lie, if we cheat, perhaps there's a fortune that can be had out here in junk bonds or insider trading
[time=2937] or in not telling everybody about the house they're about the purchase.
[time=2942] And one realtor told me an inside joke on realtors.
[time=2946] He said, "Most realtors are honest, but some of them only sell two story houses.
[time=2951] One story when you buy it and another story when you move in."
[time=2957] Honesty.
[time=2959] If you just compromise a little, there's a fortune to be gained out there.
[time=2965] As a contractor, you realize that the greatest amount of money is put into specs that are very deep within the wall.
[time=2973] Buried behind the wall covering, isn't that the reason why they call it, the wall covering?
[time=2981] There's a fortune to be gained.
[time=2984] Some Hollywood scriptwriter put these words in the mouth of an appropriate villain, J.R. Hewing.
[time=2991] Hewing said, "Once you give up integrity, everything else comes easy."
[time=2999] The Bible gives this warning, "A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare."
[time=3010] A third proverb that gives us insight into God's law.
[time=3014] A false witness will not go unpunished and he who pours out lies will not go free.
[time=3023] The trouble with a lie is when will you be caught?
[time=3028] You see, one deception leads to another and then the fear of being found out lurks constantly
[time=3036] like a dog haunting you, nipping at your heels.
[time=3041] And though we may lie and escape this consequence, will there come a day when someone else will say,
[time=3048] "I know who you are, I know what you did, I remember."
[time=3057] And even if that day never comes, you'll live today with the turmoil is today, today that it might come.
[time=3065] And even if it never comes, they'll come a day when you'll stand before God and he will say, "I remember."
[time=3075] The law of God is simple and it's clear and it commands us to speak the truth and then it commends us
[time=3084] that the truth is our very best friend.
[time=3088] Back to Exodus chapter 20 and the study of the Ten Commandments.
[time=3094] Previous to what we have already read, there is a clause that gets very little attention in the Ten Commandments.
[time=3102] In fact, usually when people print the Ten Commandments for a wall plaque or a book marker, they delete this entire clause found in verse 5.
[time=3111] It reads like this, "You shall not bow down to them, meaning idols are worshiped them,
[time=3118] for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God," now please note this phrase,
[time=3124] "punishing the children for the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
[time=3133] but showing love to thousands who love me and keep my commandments."
[time=3139] In the Ten Commandments is this insight, it is the legacy of a father,
[time=3146] that the sins that I commit as a man not only have impact on my life,
[time=3152] but they will shape tragically or triumphantly the lives of Rachel and of Rebecca and of Adam,
[time=3161] that if I am honest, they'll learn honesty from me.
[time=3165] If their mother is filled with integrity, they'll learn that from her.
[time=3170] But if I'm dishonest, they'll pick that up.
[time=3174] If I fail to speak the truth, they'll learn that lesson, that if I am covetous or greedy or filled with anger, it will be reproduced in their lives.
[time=3188] A father leaves a legacy in character in his children.
[time=3195] There is a debate amongst behavioral scientists and scholars.
[time=3201] Is our temperament learned or inherited?
[time=3207] I think the Bible answers it with the straightforward answer, yes, it is both.
[time=3213] We, first of all, have the legacy of a father that our sinful natures are passed down.
[time=3220] I inherited from my parents a set of genes, not Levi's 501s, I mean chromosomes that shape who you are physically, mentally, and even emotionally.
[time=3233] That genetic structure shaped me to be 5'8" tall, that brown hair in blue eyes.
[time=3240] But it also shaped me to have a sinful nature.
[time=3243] I inherited it from my mother and father.
[time=3245] They from theirs and my grandparents from my great-grandparents all the way back to Adam and Eve, and your parents gave you the same sinful nature.
[time=3256] It is passed down.
[time=3259] But it's not only passed down, it's also picked up.
[time=3264] While we live in our homes, we pick up habits from our parents.
[time=3271] The best illustration I can give of what Exodus 20, verse 5, is teaching us about telling the truth is found in the life of Abraham.
[time=3281] In almost every way, Abraham was a good man and a godly man, and in most areas of his life he followed God.
[time=3290] His legacy was that his son Isaac followed God, but he had a flaw in his character as well.
[time=3297] And the flaw in his character was a habit of lying.
[time=3303] One day he decided to move out of his land, to move south towards the Philistines.
[time=3307] And as he was going, he looked at his wife, sir, and she's pretty.
[time=3311] He said, "Wow." And I know those guys down there, they're sensual, they're immoral, and they'll want her.
[time=3317] When they find out I'm her husband, they'll kill me just to have her.
[time=3323] I got a plan today, Abraham.
[time=3325] I'll simply tell them a lie.
[time=3328] I'll say she is my sister.
[time=3330] He was found out in disgrace.
[time=3333] But more damaging than that, a generation goes by.
[time=3337] Isaac's in the same situation.
[time=3339] He's headed to the land of a hemilec as well.
[time=3342] And he looks at his wife and says, "She's beautiful." And I know what those people are like, "They'll kill me, just to have her." He said, "I know how to solve this.
[time=3351] I'll lie." And Isaac says, "She's not my wife, she's my sister." The legacy was passed from Abraham to Isaac.
[time=3362] Isaac is now old.
[time=3364] He's got two sons, Esau, strong, stout, burly.
[time=3371] Jacob, frail, small, smooth skin.
[time=3376] He's old.
[time=3377] The eyes don't work.
[time=3378] The ears do, but the eyes don't.
[time=3381] And coming in to receive the blessing of the firstborn, a birthright, he is told his Esau.
[time=3389] But it's Jacob.
[time=3391] Jacob speaks.
[time=3392] The old man says, "This is not Esau.
[time=3395] It's Jacob.
[time=3396] Stretch out your arm." Jacob stretches out his arm, but his arm is camouflaged.
[time=3402] It's covered with skins of animals, and it's thicker and firmer and hairier.
[time=3408] The old man can't sort through it, and he says it's the voice of Jacob, but it's the hand of Esau.
[time=3418] Jacob pulls off the lie.
[time=3421] It went from Abraham to Isaac, from Isaac to Jacob.
[time=3425] Now, Jacob has sons.
[time=3427] He's got Gad, and he's got Ruben, and he's got Simeon, and he's got Joseph.
[time=3434] And the brothers hate Joseph.
[time=3438] And they sell Joseph while their father's not around in the slavery.
[time=3442] Now, how do they explain it to the old man?
[time=3445] They take his coat, and they kill an animal, and they drip blood all over.
[time=3448] And they come say, "Oh, father, we're so sorry." The child animal has killed Joseph.
[time=3454] Here's his coat, blood stain, he's dead.
[time=3460] The legacy from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to his sons.
[time=3467] That's what Exodus means when God says, "There's iniquity.
[time=3471] The punishment of a father will visit the children to the third and the fourth generation,
[time=3477] because we are their models.
[time=3479] We are their mentors.
[time=3481] We are their examples." It's not only passed down, it's also picked up.
[time=3492] There was a man who was a pastor.
[time=3494] The story is told in our daily bread.
[time=3497] His two boys found a loving puppy, and they kept the puppy for weeks.
[time=3502] No one ever claimed it.
[time=3504] Finally, someone ran an article in the paper, and the minister saw that the dog could be
[time=3511] identified by three white hairs in its tail.
[time=3516] It's been a privilege today to share with you the musical ministry of our ladies chorus, rejoice, and soloist, Marcia Peterson.
[time=3524] The message today was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3528] If as a result of today's program, you sense a need for Jesus Christ to come into your life, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer just before we close.
[time=3538] Dear Heavenly Father, we are thankful that you came into this world to die on the cross
[time=3544] for my sins and the sins of the world, and today I have a need for Christ to come into
[time=3550] my heart.
[time=3551] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come in today.
[time=3556] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3560] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3565] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance," when you write to us, we'll be glad to send that to you.
