[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] From 1861 to 1865, for four long hard years our country went through the turmoil of the
[time=120] civil war. In the war between the states over 276,000 confederate soldiers gave their lives.
[time=130] And over 365,000 union soldiers died on our battlefields. All told over one half a million
[time=138] Americans died in the war between the states. Yet last year, within 12 months time, 1.6 million
[time=149] Americans died in abortion. We are again a nation in crisis.
[time=159] (dramatic music)
[time=173] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=178] Rick's message today is entitled a nation in crisis. Two hundred thirteen years ago this nation
[time=184] was formed out of the crisis of the Revolutionary War. One hundred twenty-eight years ago we faced our greatest crisis in the civil war, North against South, countrymen against countrymen, even
[time=195] brother against brother. Today we are facing the greatest crisis since the war between the states where over one half a million Americans died. In the last 12 months, 1.6 million
[time=206] Americans died at the hands of their fellow countrymen. We call it abortion. Today we will
[time=212] study this crisis that faces our nation. We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us. The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song. We will also be hearing from
[time=225] celebration and Lynn Rowell. The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry at the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=235] in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time. We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=248] Now here's Rick.
[time=249] This is today. We also want to welcome our friends. We join us for the Bible Hour. We trust that
[time=255] God will use this hour to glorify his name and our hearts. We meet today because our God is
[time=261] healing and he's gracious. Our choir reminds us of his graciousness by singing a medley of
[time=267] songs that speak of God's grace.
[time=291] We need toâ€¦ Bruce, good cut off. There are always times when your mind is going, "I
[time=315] don't know what to do right now." So we're going to begin again and sing a great song on
[time=322] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's called the Grace Medley, accompanied by Scott Schindler
[time=329] and the Lord Jesus Christ. We are the last grace of our Lord people. Grace that is the
[time=358] grace of the Lord Jesus Christ God God God God God God God God God God God God God God
[time=386] God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God
[time=499] with the grace of God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God
[time=526] God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God God
[time=612] We are grateful for the great love of Jesus Christ and how we are so privileged to be chosen to receive that love my Savior's love him number 512 will sing the first fourth and fifth stands us together of 512.
[time=642] (Music)
[time=756] Thank you very much for your good singing we continue with music now celebration comes to sing for us let's listen as they minister to us in song.
[time=786] (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music)
[time=820] We will sing the songs of Zion and lift our hands in praise with joyful adoration our voices we will raise.
[time=834] He will come before his presence all in one accord giving him the glory.
[time=850] (Music)
[time=990] (Applause) Each week it's our privilege to share our morning worship service by way of television with you friends.
[time=1001] We hope God uses this hour today to help those of you who are spiritually searching come to a conclusion and a decision for Christ.
[time=1010] And for those who are believers that this hour will be one that your faith is greatly strengthened.
[time=1015] As you watch today here in the Fort Wayne area it's jalai the second in the patriotic panorama is today.
[time=1021] We work hard for the patriotic panorama and look forward to that special event in the middle of our summer to recognize what God has done for our country and thank him for the freedom that we have in the United States of America.
[time=1035] This past year Kathy and I had the privilege of going to Washington DC and while we were there we got to see Congress and session and walk through the White House and all the other great points of interest.
[time=1046] And it really did fan the flames of patriotism in our heart and I'm thankful that our church does this so that here in the local community we can recommit ourselves to our heritage.
[time=1056] Rick we can't take them to Washington DC but we can invite you to come this afternoon at 4 o'clock if you live in the Fort Wayne area to our annual patriotic panorama that we're entitleding Look Up America.
[time=1069] I'll be highlighting our flag and the presidents of the United States so once again that's at 4 p.m. today July 2nd at the worship center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1080] It's probably too late for you friends who watch in California to fly in but those in the greater Fort Wayne area we hope you'll come and join us.
[time=1088] During the month of July on Wednesdays we're offering what we'll call the Summer Bible Institute.
[time=1094] That's a pretty formal sounding title. We're going to look very closely at one biblical issue and that is the deity of Jesus Christ and for four Wednesday nights we'll study who the Lord Jesus is.
[time=1107] It will be a time where we'll provide a little booklet so that you can study along and have a take home guide so that you can dig deeper.
[time=1114] We'll have for those who are more serious minded even a little homework that they could do.
[time=1119] Others may just want to come and listen but it's an opportunity to in depth study God's Word.
[time=1125] It's the first time I've done this in the summer with a Bible Institute class and I'm looking forward to teaching that.
[time=1131] And so you friends who don't have a midweek service we invite you to Black Hawk in July at seven o'clock on Wednesday evenings.
[time=1138] And so bring your pencil and your Bible and be ready to study.
[time=1141] We'll be ready. We look forward to that Rick and already we've had calls this week.
[time=1144] It just happened to be by the switchboard when the lady called and said I think that's what I need for this summer and we gave her the information and she's planning on being here.
[time=1153] We're grateful and we hope many people join us for that Institute. And along with that is the need to be regularly in God's Word on our own.
[time=1162] And for that purpose we offer you a booklet entitled A Closer Walk.
[time=1166] This publication will help you to begin the habit of daily being in God's Word.
[time=1173] It will take you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=1177] I know of nothing that has helped my spiritual life more than my own time in God's Word.
[time=1182] I have to put that ahead of all the messages that I've heard, all the Sunday school classes that I've ever attended or taught,
[time=1189] all the classes that I took in college or seminary combined have not had the influence in my life that simply being regularly a student of God's Word has done.
[time=1200] And I commend that practice to you and hope you'll write today for this booklet.
[time=1205] You can receive Closer Walk by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1216] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1225] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1230] [MUSIC - 278 seconds]
[time=1513] Thank you, Lynn and Father, we thank you for your name.
[time=1523] That you've trusted us with your name.
[time=1527] We should be called today by the name of our God, of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
[time=1535] And we want to honor you today.
[time=1537] We want this service to glorify your name.
[time=1541] We want the precepts and principles of your word to be laid again for the building of our lives.
[time=1548] We come today to offer you the gift of our worship and our plays.
[time=1552] And we would even ask you to assist us in that.
[time=1556] We begin by saying, "Wash us and cleanse us." Take away the stain of a week's living of seven days of punctuated by sin.
[time=1567] As David would sing, "We would cry out, 'Create in me a clean heart, O Lord,' and renew a right spirit within me." We would ask that you would restore the joy of our salvation.
[time=1580] We would pray today asking for your strength for those who walk through the valley.
[time=1585] We pray for George Roars that as he has an exploratory surgery for cancer, that it would give opportunity for quick attention and full recovery.
[time=1595] We pray for others, Jack Saylor, Ardeen Marker, Catherine Northrop, who are battling cancer.
[time=1602] We'd pray for Susan's father, that Florence Toyarac would be restored to strength and opportunity of ministry.
[time=1610] We'd pray today for spiritual strength, that you'd give us the commitment and the conviction to live and to walk in a life uncompromising.
[time=1621] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1627] This morning, I would like to speak on a subject that I have spoken on several times before.
[time=1634] Eight months ago, we covered this same subject.
[time=1637] It is the issue of abortion.
[time=1640] I admit that we've spoken on it before and want to explain why we're returning to that today.
[time=1647] But even before that explanation, let me tell you today what I really want to do is to embrace you in the Scriptures.
[time=1655] I want those of you today who have had abortions, and there are those here who have, the know of the forgiveness of God and the know of strength.
[time=1665] I don't want to add to your hurt.
[time=1667] Many of you have told me of that pain.
[time=1670] And so as I speak, please accept this word not as a dosage of guilt, but as a word of warning that I'm passing on to others who would contemplate abortion, your message to me has been one of regret, and I will pass that on to the rest.
[time=1688] But we also want to try to turn a tide in the nation where abortion is the number one leading cause of death.
[time=1697] It was said in Fort Wayne, Indiana, prior to the recent construction, the most dangerous intersection in Fort Wayne was that of St. Joe Road and St. Joe's Center Road on the north end of town.
[time=1708] The most dangerous city to live in the United States used to be Detroit.
[time=1712] It's now passed by Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.
[time=1716] But the most dangerous place to live in America is in the womb of a mother.
[time=1721] Thirty percent of pregnancies in the United States in this past year were terminated by abortion.
[time=1727] Time magazine estimates that one out of five women have had that procedure.
[time=1733] I'd like to address several issues with you today, and I want to be fair.
[time=1738] Some of the things I'll say to you, I believe are rising right out of the scriptures.
[time=1743] Occasionally I want to give you my opinion.
[time=1745] I also want to be honest and tell you when it is just my opinion.
[time=1750] First of all, why are we speaking on this subject again?
[time=1754] For several reasons.
[time=1756] One is that the Supreme Court has recently convened and will soon release their announcement as to a case out of Missouri, which will have implications, perhaps reversing in part Roe v. Wade.
[time=1772] A second reason to speak on this subject is this.
[time=1776] We are in the limelight as a city because of our influence in the pro-life movement as a community.
[time=1786] And Operation Rescue is active in our town and it is raised inside our church and outside many questions.
[time=1794] But the most important reason is this.
[time=1797] The last time we spoke on this subject was November the 6th, 1988.
[time=1803] That has been some seven to eight months.
[time=1807] In that time approximately 800,000 to 1 million children
[time=1813] have been aborted since we've talked of this subject last.
[time=1817] That number means that a population far beyond Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1823] beyond Allen County, beyond the counties of the 4th Congressional District,
[time=1829] populations exceeding all of that have been eliminated.
[time=1835] Gone through abortion.
[time=1838] It means the city of Indianapolis, in numbers of population, would be wiped off the globe.
[time=1850] Could you imagine how we would feel today if somebody said there is planned legislation before Congress today to simply eliminate Northeastern Indiana?
[time=1865] I don't know about you, but I have at least right my Congressman.
[time=1871] It's epidemic.
[time=1874] The second thing I'd like to do is very quickly relay a foundation that we have laid often in our church, the case that life begins at conception.
[time=1884] I won't spend much time here because we have said this before.
[time=1890] Allow this brief biblical record.
[time=1894] Job 31, verse 15.
[time=1897] "Did not he who made me," said Job, "in the womb make them." Speaking of his fellow man.
[time=1904] "Did not the same one God formed us both within our mother's womb."
[time=1910] That verse tells us directly and without the aid of any interpretation that life begins in the womb and it's the workmanship of God.
[time=1921] Psalm 119 and verse 73 reads,
[time=1928] "Your hands, Lord, made me and formed me.
[time=1933] Give me understanding to learn your commandments." I think the clearest passage is Psalm 139 verses 13 through 16.
[time=1943] If you don't hear any of God's word today, I hope you'll listen to this one.
[time=1948] You created my innermost being.
[time=1951] You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[time=1963] I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=1966] Your works are wonderful.
[time=1968] I know them full well.
[time=1969] My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
[time=1977] Your eyes saw my unformed body.
[time=1984] Out of the New Testament comes this remarkable testimony.
[time=1988] It's the story of Mary pregnant by the Holy Spirit with Jesus looking for someone
[time=1995] who would believe that story.
[time=1997] You have to admit that's a tough one to swallow.
[time=1999] I mean picture this, Dad.
[time=2001] Your 15-year-old girl comes home and says, "Dad, I've got some good news.
[time=2006] I'm going to have a baby." Your countenance falls because you know your daughter is not married.
[time=2012] She says, "But Dad, don't be worried God made me pregnant." That's a tough one to go home and tell Dad.
[time=2021] Who would believe such a story of a miraculous conception?
[time=2026] You know who would believe such a story?
[time=2029] A cousin named Elizabeth.
[time=2031] It was old, well past, child-bearing years who God said, "I'll give you a miraculous birth conception as well." And she is pregnant with John the Baptist.
[time=2042] She'll believe that story.
[time=2044] And so Mary goes to visit Elizabeth and here's what Luke 139 tells us.
[time=2050] At that time, Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah where she entered Zachariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
[time=2060] When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2067] In a loud voice, she exclaimed, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear.
[time=2076] But why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
[time=2082] Note this, "As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby and my womb leaped for joy." That passage is telling us of the viability and the life of John the Baptist
[time=2098] and what he understood is up for grabs, but the life connection is real.
[time=2105] I don't want to pretend that this message out of this verse in Luke is telling us that John the Baptist in the womb heard Mary's comment and had the intellectual capability to understand that Jesus were going to be born and he was going to be the Messiah, and he started jumping up and down.
[time=2125] I have a six-year-old son who I don't think I could explain all that to him comprehend it.
[time=2131] Then what are we saying?
[time=2133] We're saying that either A, God supernaturally triggered a response of life
[time=2141] and of a motion of joy in John the Baptist, or B, that out of sympathy
[time=2147] to his mother's joy, the baby responded with the same emotion.
[time=2153] And either way, we're saying that there was life in that womb capable of an emotional expression of joy.
[time=2162] I believe the biblical record is strong and intact and clear that life begins in the womb in that conception.
[time=2170] Now I know many of you either here or watching by way of television may not be disposed to thumbing through the Bible and you may need other evidence.
[time=2181] Allow me to share just a little bit of biology with you.
[time=2186] At the moment of conception, now, not in the third trimester, not in the third month, not in the third week, not in the third day.
[time=2195] At the moment of conception, the sex of that child is determined.
[time=2201] If it's a boy or if it's a girl.
[time=2204] At 19 days, the eyes are already beginning to develop.
[time=2208] At 24 days, the heart is beating.
[time=2214] At three to five weeks, 40 pairs of muscles are developed.
[time=2221] At six weeks, the skeletal structure and the reflexes are present.
[time=2228] At 43 days, an electrical encephalogram can pick up brain waves
[time=2235] and the FBI will be glad to know that the fingerprints are done.
[time=2240] 43 days, six weeks.
[time=2244] That's just about the time most of you know for sure that you're pregnant.
[time=2253] That leads us to another question. If we know life begins at the womb, biologically and biblically, what responsibility do we have having known this
[time=2266] and knowing that our nation is engaging in 1.6 million abortions a year?
[time=2275] Allow me to draw your attention to these words of Ezekiel and Ezekiel 33,
[time=2281] verses one through seven.
[time=2283] Give to us, excuse me, one through six give us a historical lesson and then seven through nine give to us an application.
[time=2294] Let me paraphrase what verses one through six say.
[time=2297] Verses one through six says that a fortified city appoints a watchman.
[time=2301] The watchman job is to be alert and to keep his eye out for the approach of enemies.
[time=2307] The enemy approaches he is to blow the horn and if the watchman blows his horn and the people don't run to the city for protection, it's their fault and the watchman is innocent.
[time=2320] But if the watchman fails to see the enemy approach or he fails to blow the warning
[time=2326] and the enemy comes, then his blood is responsible for the blood of all who died
[time=2335] because he failed to serve as a watchman.
[time=2339] Now here's the application, verses seven through nine.
[time=2344] Ezekiel, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel.
[time=2350] So here the word I speak and give them warning from me.
[time=2357] When I say to the wicked, oh wicked man you will surely die
[time=2363] and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways.
[time=2367] That wicked man will die for his sin and I will hold you accountable for his blood.
[time=2375] But if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways and he does not do so, he will die for his sins and you will have saved yourself.
[time=2386] The application is this.
[time=2388] The Ezekiel was the war nation. If he warned them, they were responsible for their own destiny.
[time=2394] But if he failed to warn them, then their blood would be upon his hands.
[time=2402] And the church of Jesus Christ has been called to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[time=2409] We are God's watchmen in this day.
[time=2414] And although you may have never had an abortion, are men while you never have paid for an abortion,
[time=2420] or you may have never been the doctor who did such a procedure.
[time=2425] If you know that life begins at the world and you do not warn this country,
[time=2433] blood of those children is on you and it's on me.
[time=2441] We do not have the prerogative of saying, I didn't know or I didn't know what to do.
[time=2450] I didn't want to get involved because church is not not to be political.
[time=2454] I agree.
[time=2456] The purpose of this church is not to discuss annexation of St. Joe Township.
[time=2461] The purpose of our church is not to make a recommendation on whether we have a county option in contacts or not.
[time=2469] But the purpose of our church is to warn people of the warnings of God's Word.
[time=2479] With that in mind, the question then rises, what can we do?
[time=2483] And I want to suggest four things and give them to you in what I believe to be their order of priority.
[time=2489] The first and most important thing that we can do is this.
[time=2494] We spiritually commit our lives to Jesus Christ in the Holy Living and teach it to others.
[time=2502] You see, abortion is primarily a remedy for illegitimate sexual behavior.
[time=2511] I know that many abortions are done to eliminate a child when a couple is legitimately married.
[time=2518] But I do not have documents but a strong hunch that most of them are to eliminate an unwanted illegitimate pregnancy.
[time=2533] 1800 years ago, 1800 years ago, a Roman, not a Christian, wrote these words.
[time=2542] Abortion exists because people want to be free, free from pregnancy and free to indulge in sexuality and free from the burden of children.
[time=2555] Abortion exists for two reasons.
[time=2558] It exists on this side because of sexual promiscuity and it exists on this side for economics.
[time=2565] There's a lot of money in this business.
[time=2569] And the most important thing we can do is to cut the product down at supply and demand.
[time=2576] If there weren't people pregnant who didn't want to have babies, there wouldn't be abortions.
[time=2583] And learn this lesson from history.
[time=2587] We will always have abortion.
[time=2592] We will always have them.
[time=2594] If not in this country and the next, if not in this state across the state line, if not legally, we'll probably have them illegally.
[time=2603] The greatest solution we can have is spiritual revival.
[time=2610] If you want to make a difference, commit yourself to a holy living and teach it to your children and to this community.
[time=2618] The second thing we can do is this, work hard to elect officials who have a pro-life commitment.
[time=2630] This issue went before the Supreme Court largely for three reasons.
[time=2635] Here are the reasons why the Supreme Court in Webster v. Missouri is considering a change in Roe v. Wade.
[time=2646] Reason number one is some people in Missouri elected local and state officials, state legislators who made it along Missouri
[time=2657] that you couldn't use state funds to perform an abortion.
[time=2661] District attorneys who would say, "I'll fight that case" and not say, "Well, we've already heard the Supreme Court rule on it.
[time=2668] I'm not going to touch it." It was the election of those local officials.
[time=2674] The second reason why that case is before the Supreme Court is because of the election of President Ronald Reagan
[time=2683] who appointed chief justices with a pro-life viewpoint.
[time=2689] Because Reagan was elected and he was pro-life, he appointed judges of that posture.
[time=2696] And the third reason is because people elected senators who would stand behind the president's appointment.
[time=2706] I may disappoint some of you.
[time=2709] My original educational background is not Bible or theology.
[time=2714] It is history and political theory.
[time=2717] And I believe with all my heart that this is the greatest country that has ever been on the face of the earth.
[time=2728] And we have the greatest political system.
[time=2731] And I believe with all of my heart it will work if we will work the system.
[time=2739] And I'm not trying to pat myself on the back nor criticize you, but I have to speak my heart at this point.
[time=2746] My wife and I have been involved in local politics extensively.
[time=2750] The only way we could be more involved would be to run for office ourselves.
[time=2755] And having been at all the political events that we could possibly go to, I don't see very many of you there.
[time=2764] We go to the debates. I don't see very many of you there.
[time=2768] We go to the speeches that are made. I don't see very many of you there.
[time=2774] We go when the vice president comes to town. I don't see very many of you there.
[time=2779] We go when senators Luger and Coates are here. I don't see very many of you.
[time=2785] I hope you're voting.
[time=2790] The system will work if you will work the system.
[time=2796] And that is the second greatest priority you can have in fighting this issue.
[time=2803] The third thing that you can do is you can work for creative alternatives to abortion.
[time=2808] It's not enough to say don't you get an abortion. Don't you perform an abortion.
[time=2813] Hey young man don't tell your girlfriend if you love me you'll let me.
[time=2817] And then when she's pregnant you'll say if you love me you'll get an abortion.
[time=2821] We can't just say those things.
[time=2823] We've got to look into the eyes of a woman who's pregnant and doesn't know how she's going to survive and say we will help you.
[time=2830] You don't have a place to live. Come with me. We'll go to the crisis pregnancy center together.
[time=2835] And they've got shepherding homes. You can't raise this child but you'll give birth to it and adopt it.
[time=2840] We'll help you. There's a Baptist children's home that will take that child.
[time=2844] They'll provide medical care for you and they'll find a godly home for that child.
[time=2849] You want to keep that baby and you can't afford diapers?
[time=2852] We'll get you diapers. Don't have a baby bed? We'll get you one.
[time=2857] Now that I've stepped on your toes over the political issue let me compliment you that no church is more involved than our church is in the crisis pregnancy center.
[time=2867] But let's not get too carried away. We ought to be the most involved just on our sheer size.
[time=2874] But it's not enough to say thou shall not and leave them in their pain.
[time=2879] We need to say we want to help you through all of this.
[time=2885] The fourth thing is the most sensitive and touchy of all.
[time=2888] It is the involvement in marches and movements and things like operation rescue.
[time=2896] I want to share some perspectives with you.
[time=2899] For some of you as soon as you hear the word march and operation rescue or any type of public demonstration immediately you get uncomfortable.
[time=2908] I immediately get uncomfortable. I grew up five miles from Kent State University in their days of national attention for the riots that were there.
[time=2918] I find no pleasure in those type of things.
[time=2921] But allow me to give you some perspectives on that.
[time=2924] Perspective number one, marches and demonstrations are legal.
[time=2930] Please don't think that they're illegal. We are granted those if done properly and appropriately.
[time=2938] Secondly is this. We Christian Americans have a severe case of schizophrenia on this issue.
[time=2947] I use that term metaphorically. What I mean is this.
[time=2953] On the one hand we grow up and we think the Boston Tea Party, that was great.
[time=2960] My sister and I grew up watching the wonderful world of Disney and our favorite shows were the Swamp Fox and Johnny Tremaine.
[time=2967] And we marched around the house singing, "We are the sons, we are the sons, the sons of liberty." We regretted that we were born 200 years too late for the Boston Tea Party.
[time=2978] And today we sit around as evangelical Christians and we say to the students of Tiananmen Square, "Fight for freedom.
[time=2987] America's behind you. Protest. Take to the streets." And we come home and we say, "Oh, I don't know if 1.6 million children.
[time=2996] I don't know if we'd want to carry a sign. That doesn't seem appropriate."
[time=3002] It's called cognitive dissonance. It doesn't fit.
[time=3007] Either it's all right to carry a sign and to demonstrate for pro-life or we need to rewrite our Christian history books about the Boston Tea Party, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington.
[time=3021] Which brings us to this then question. What do we do if the government says, "You can't protest. You can't march. You cannot." I believe that we have the greatest country in the world.
[time=3038] And I want to always be found faithful and true to this land.
[time=3044] But never at the expense of being faithful and true to the Lord.
[time=3049] And if there's ever a time when any government says, "We must do something that God says we must not." Our government says, "You must not." And God says you must.
[time=3063] Our responsibility is to God.
[time=3067] Let me give you four biblical examples. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[time=3073] We're told by the king. They had to worship his idol.
[time=3079] They had to worship his God. They had to follow him.
[time=3082] They said, "No." And he said, "Fine.
[time=3087] If you don't, we'll throw you in the fiery furnace." And they stayed true to the Lord and they got thrown in the fiery furnace.
[time=3094] Daniel was told, "Don't pray anymore." God said, "Pray." Daniel prayed and he was thrown in the lion's den.
[time=3102] New Testament. The Magi come.
[time=3105] They come to Herod and they said, "Where is he born king of the Jews?" And Herod plays the part and acts like he's interested.
[time=3113] He inquires and finds out it's Bethlehem and then he says to the Magi.
[time=3117] And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can worship him.
[time=3122] The king said, "You come back." And they were told in the dream of his plan and they did not come back.
[time=3130] The apostles were drug before the magistrates of their days and they were told, "Do not speak again in the name of Jesus."
[time=3141] They did two things.
[time=3143] They said to those magistrates, "Our allegiance is to God first." And the second thing they did is they went out and spoke in the name of Jesus.
[time=3154] Proverbs 24-11 gives to us our responsibility.
[time=3159] It says this, "Rescue those being led to death.
[time=3165] Hold back those staggering towards slaughter." If you say, "Oh, but we knew nothing about this." Does not he who weighs the hearts perceive it?
[time=3177] Does not he who guards your life know it?
[time=3180] Well, he will repay each person according to what he has done.
[time=3188] There are four things here before us that we can do.
[time=3193] We can be committed to teaching God's Word and turning the tide in our land.
[time=3199] That is the most important.
[time=3201] The second thing we can do is we can work to elected government officials.
[time=3206] That is second.
[time=3209] Thirdly, we can work to create alternatives.
[time=3213] So a woman who is not certain what her life holds will know that there is help.
[time=3219] And then finally, we can take an active role in things like marches and operation rescue.
[time=3225] I'm not saying that all of us should do all of these.
[time=3229] I won't do all of these, but I will do several of these and I will do them frequently and intently.
[time=3236] I want to know what are you going to do?
[time=3239] God says you're to rescue them.
[time=3242] Maybe you don't like Plan 1 or Plan 3 or Plan 4 or Plan 2.
[time=3246] As DL Moody once asked the lady who criticized him for what he was doing, he said, "How do you do it?"
[time=3252] And she said, "Well, I don't." He said, "Well, I like the way I'm doing it better and the way you're not doing it." What are you going to do?
[time=3262] And now I want to turn to our attention to some very tough things.
[time=3269] And some of these are biblical and some of them are not and I want to give you the honesty
[time=3275] to know when they're just mine.
[time=3277] The first is abortion is going to go away.
[time=3280] Abortion clinics are going to close.
[time=3283] Abortionists are going to be out of business.
[time=3286] There no longer will be mutilation and suction.
[time=3290] There will no longer be saloon solutions.
[time=3292] It's all going to end, but not because the pro-lifers have won the battle.
[time=3298] It's because we now have pills like RU486 that a woman in her home can take a pill.
[time=3305] She doesn't have to go to the doctor.
[time=3307] There doesn't have to be a lethal injection.
[time=3309] There doesn't have to be suction.
[time=3312] And I hope that we as believers in Christ will fight abortion through the pill.
[time=3318] RU486 or any of its clones, just as much as we will, the other means that are more violent.
[time=3327] A second tough thing to face is this.
[time=3330] My Bible is closed.
[time=3331] This is Hawks' opinion.
[time=3334] I'm speaking out of political viewpoint, not biblical.
[time=3340] I hope that we're smart enough in the pro-life camp to rejoice over any victories we can get
[time=3348] and not shoot ourselves in the foot over any victories we cannot get.
[time=3352] I know I'm speaking cryptically, let me explain.
[time=3355] I think it's likely that we can have a shrinking of the parameters of when abortion is allowed.
[time=3362] I doubt that we will ever be able to get rid of abortion in the cases of rape, incest, eugenic and therapeutic abortions.
[time=3372] My opinion is, I hope we're smart enough to praise the government, the leaders, the judges, the congressmen, the president, the senators,
[time=3380] and everyone who is involved who will shrink the borders back and not take the posture while that isn't good enough because it didn't go far enough.
[time=3391] We all want to get as much as we can, but be thankful for what you can get.
[time=3397] That's Hawks' political theory.
[time=3399] Tough issue number three, these are my opinions.
[time=3404] There are two types of abortion that we don't talk as much about eugenic abortion and therapeutic abortion.
[time=3410] Eugenic abortion means good birth.
[time=3412] That's just two Greek words squished together.
[time=3414] That's where eugenic comes from.
[time=3416] Eugenic abortion is performed when we believe or we know that the baby going to be born is not going to have a good birth.
[time=3424] It's going to be handicapped in some way.
[time=3427] I personally am against eugenic abortion.
[time=3430] Two reasons.
[time=3431] Reason number one is we don't always know what we think we know and secondly who decides what's a good birth.
[time=3437] Somebody says, "Well, I'm going to eliminate this one because it's severely mentally and physically retarded." Someone says, "Well, I'm going to eliminate this one because it's severely mentally retarded." Someone says, "I'm going to eliminate this one because it's sort of physically retarded." Somebody says, "I'm going to eliminate this one because I wanted a girl and it's a boy."
[time=3455] Therapeutic abortion.
[time=3459] I know I speak with the greatest caution here.
[time=3463] This is my opinion.
[time=3465] Therapeutic abortion is an abortion that is done to save the life of the mother.
[time=3470] It may not even be an abortion procedure.
[time=3472] It may be another medical procedure to save the mother's life then result is the loss of the child.
[time=3478] This is just Rick's opinion.
[time=3480] I need to answer that because I'm your pastor and you look to me.
[time=3485] That doesn't mean I have all the answers.
[time=3487] It doesn't mean I'm right on every issue.
[time=3489] I may not be right here.
[time=3490] This is my opinion.
[time=3491] If to the best of medical experts and knowledge the mother's life is in danger, I would stand by the side of that mother and father should they choose to have any necessary medical procedure
[time=3502] to save the mother's life that jeopardizes or loses the life of a child.
[time=3507] I hope it never happened.
[time=3521] We've been sharing with you this morning the ministry of our sanctuary choir, soloist Lynn Roll and celebration.
[time=3527] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3530] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal Savior
[time=3536] just before we close I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3539] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins
[time=3547] and today I have a need to ask for your forgiveness and to ask you to come into my heart and cleanse me
[time=3553] of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3555] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3559] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3564] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3574] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the devotional guide Closer Walk please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort White Indiana, 46815.
