[time=90] It is ironic that our country is debating the constitutional right for prayer in school
[time=113] and other public meetings, for when the Constitution was being forged out in the constitutional
[time=120] convention, those delegates reached an impasse until Benjamin Franklin said, "Gentlemen,
[time=128] if it is impossible for us sparrow to fall without his notice, is it probable that an
[time=134] empire could rise without his aid, I therefore move, that prayers asking for the assistance
[time=142] of heaven be offered in this place before it business each day."
[time=149] The foundation and the strength of a nation is prayer.
[time=156] (bells chiming)
[time=165] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks, thank you for joining us.
[time=174] Rick's message today is entitled "The Strength of a Nation." America has had a rich history of prayer.
[time=181] George Washington was observed regularly on his knees praying before sunlight.
[time=186] Lincoln prayed our nation through the difficult years of the Civil War.
[time=190] Pedro Wilson was an unapologetic man of prayer, as were many other of our presidents.
[time=196] The strength of a nation is its commitment to prayer.
[time=199] Paul told Timothy, "I urge that prayer be made of all men, for kings and all who are in authority." We invite you to study with us today on praying for our nation.
[time=210] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=214] Rick's text is taken from the book of 1 Timothy chapter 2 verses 1 through 7.
[time=220] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=225] Our special musical guests today are the Sounds Alive, and Ron Mapes.
[time=234] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=243] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=249] Now, here's Rick.
[time=252] We welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour and trust that as we sing songs that America loves, our patriotic songs that will take us beyond
[time=262] our love for America to praise for the God who is so richly blessed us.
[time=267] Our choir begins by leading us in a great patriotic rendition of the battle hymn of the Republic.
[time=302] My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.
[time=315] He is rapping out the vintage wear, the braids of breath on the sword, he has to lose the
[time=332] body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the
[time=1101] a typical church service. We'll be producing or we already have produced in fact a syllabus that gives you a full outline of the four studies we are doing on the deity of Christ. We'll look at the biblical evidence that teaches us that Jesus is God. We'll look at some of the problems of how do you say that Jesus is a hundred percent God and a hundred percent man at the same time. We'll look at proof for the resurrection that there was no Passover plot that Jesus did arise from the dead.
[time=1131] We'll also study what makes a cult a cult. What is it that they believe different about Jesus that makes them outside of Orthodox Christianity?
[time=1142] Well the Summer Bible Institute is the Wednesday nights of July at seven o'clock here in the worship center at Blackhawk and we want to invite you friends to join us on Wednesday night to study with us. Do you have your Bible and your pencil ready?
[time=1156] I'm looking forward to the Summer Bible Conference. We certainly had a good time in June with the guest speakers that we had and the topics that you have for July are going to be very interesting and informative for all of us.
[time=1167] Also today we want to encourage you to write for this little publication that we've put together. It's simply a prayer reminder that lists what God's Word tells us to do and that is to pray for all men, kings and all in authority.
[time=1183] And we were here talking a moment ago and we're a little embarrassed that we couldn't name all of the cabinet members and the justices of the Supreme Court and yet we're responsible to pray for those men and women.
[time=1194] And so as a church we've put together this brochure that lists the President, the Vice President for those of you who are Hoosiers, our Governor and Lieutenant Governor and the justices of the Indiana Supreme Court along with our national leaders, our Congresswoman and our Senators.
[time=1210] A lot of the people who we hear their names occasionally but not as often as we hear of President Bush or Vice President Quail so that you can be part of a Biblical team praying for our country.
[time=1222] So if you would like a copy of this we'll mail it to you free simply write and ask for it today.
[time=1228] Rick has encouraged you to write and you may write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1238] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1247] We do hope you'll make a new commitment today to praying for America.
[time=1252] In the news we're hearing troubling things that our flag can be burnt and we're just supposed to view that as a freedom of speech.
[time=1260] We're seeing the erosion of credibility and high office and yet we have failed to take the initiative for our most powerful option and that is prayer.
[time=1271] So we hope you will pray for America. It's easier to criticize, more difficult to get on our knees and to do something about it.
[time=1279] We hope you'll write today and we'll send you the prayer card for America.
[time=1283] Thank you again for being a part of the Bible Hour today as we go back to our morning worship service.
[time=1289] We're looking forward to celebrating God's grace particularly as he is shedded upon America.
[time=1313] He took all my sins and forgave them forever.
[time=1318] Glory by the New Year to the Son.
[time=1322] He will be soon let me tell you about my Jesus.
[time=1330] He took all my sins and forgave them forever.
[time=1334] Glory by the New Year to the Son.
[time=1338] You know the story how he left his home in heaven.
[time=1343] You heard about the miracles he's done.
[time=1347] Resurrection power has been given to his children.
[time=1351] For lessons for eternity have just begun.
[time=1355] Glory by the New Year to the Son.
[time=1371] Let you let his loving hand wipe away on tears have you.
[time=1384] Let him come your peace.
[time=1388] He's waiting for you to answer his call.
[time=1395] Life everlasting is waiting for you.
[time=1406] Come on and listen to the say your he wants to take you by the hand.
[time=1415] He will lead you on a journey over to the promised hand.
[time=1424] Hear the say your gently calling.
[time=1432] Let him take you by the hand.
[time=1440] Follow him today and he will be here through the promise land.
[time=1456] Please call him through you, hear him just with him.
[time=1473] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1481] I can't tell you what a privilege it's been to have the sounds alive back here for the weekend.
[time=1485] It brings back so many memories and we're well on our way to the new sounds alive with about 20 kids represented by the members of the present sounds alive.
[time=1496] Just a few years I may have a cane but those kids will be up here and we'll get them involved in music.
[time=1503] Many years ago now I'm not going to tell you how many that I taught at Los Angeles Baptist College.
[time=1508] One of the young men that came the second year I was there was a tall, lean, good-looking fellow.
[time=1517] When I auditioned the choir he came through and sang and I just about ran out of my office because I was so excited about this young voice that was just already terrific.
[time=1529] We had a great time of relationship in the four years that he was at the college and over the years we've been associated
[time=1537] and it's a privilege now to have him as a minister of music up in Anchorage, Alaska.
[time=1542] We just really do love Ron and appreciate his ministry.
[time=1546] We want you to listen now as he ministers to us because he has a great voice and a great love for the Lord
[time=1552] and it shows us he sings for us right now.
[time=1555] [MUSIC - 345 seconds]
[time=1906] Our father, we do come today to bless, to exalt, and to magnify your name.
[time=1914] Forgive us for the moments and we have used the name of Jesus tritely, commercially, and most of all contemptibly.
[time=1924] And now we exalt and magnify the name of Jesus and we do bow before him today and worship him as Lord and God.
[time=1932] And we surrender our lives to you today.
[time=1935] We come to this worship service to offer to you our praise and yet we find that you have already given to us a new and refreshed spirit overflowing.
[time=1946] And even as Ron has sung this morning, we do want to bless the Lord. We want to thank you for your goodness.
[time=1954] We want to thank you for giving to this church, people who love you, who have spent this week as ambassadors for Christ, sharing the Lord in the marketplace.
[time=1966] Thank you for those women who have opened up their homes to Bible studies throughout the year, to those men who unashamedly named the name of Christ at a business lunch.
[time=1976] For those who have invited friends to a panorama or a living Christmas tree are found away to share Christ. Thank you.
[time=1986] Well, thank you for those who have prepared the music of the day, those who have ushered to make it possible for those to come in the building who are handicapped or disabled, those who have come through the door with their arms full of small children were helped.
[time=2002] Thank you for their friendliness.
[time=2004] Thank you for the gentle hands that are rocking children asleep in the nursery now.
[time=2009] Thank you for those who are teaching our children in the educational building.
[time=2015] Thank you for those who are opening up your word to adults, that they might understand the precepts of your counsel.
[time=2022] Today, God, most of all, we want to thank you for America, for the enormous blessing that you have shed on our country, for the riches of liberty that we know that are unparalleled in the world,
[time=2035] for the abundance of spiritual opportunities that our ours, we give you thanks, and we worship you, not the country with which you have blessed us.
[time=2047] We also come today thinking of our president and vice president asking you to give them wisdom as they govern our land.
[time=2055] May they make decisions that will honor and please you.
[time=2059] We pray for our legislatures and congressmen and women and senators that you will help them to govern the past legislation that will bring about a government that will know propriety as well as liberty.
[time=2077] We would pray today for our court that you will give them wisdom to make decisions not based upon popular opinion but wisdom from above.
[time=2089] And now we would pray for those who are walking through dark valleys.
[time=2094] We pray for Debbie Moore today and her family as they mourn the tragic loss of her brother in a boating accident.
[time=2101] We pray for Colin Lister as his body fights to recover from open heart surgery.
[time=2106] For Florence Toyrakis, his body is still in desperate situations fighting cancer and major surgery.
[time=2116] We pray for Dan Lantman that his body will recover from Crohn's.
[time=2122] We pray for the comfort for all of those who are today mourning the loss of loved ones from days or months going by.
[time=2130] Now as we open up your word, we ask you to teach us not simply to stir our hearts but to give us food for living.
[time=2139] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=2146] It is ironic that it is debated in our land whether prayer should be a part of our public schools or whether prayer should be a part of the platform of a governmental meeting.
[time=2159] Ironic I say because it was 202 years ago that our 13 colonies were not the United States of America.
[time=2168] They were 13 loosely confederated colonies merging together poorly under a document called the Articles of Confederation.
[time=2178] There was no constitution in 1787. Seeing that this loosely confederated country was not working, delegates were sent from each of the colonies to Philadelphia.
[time=2194] There they convened in an event called the Constitutional Congress. There attempts to draft a document were about as futile as there attempts to live under the Articles of Confederation.
[time=2208] At a moment of exasperation, the senior statesman of that group, 81-year-old Benjamin Franklin took the floor. He reasoned with these words.
[time=2219] "Gentlemen," said Franklin, "if it is not possible for a sparrow to fall without his notice, is it conceivable that an empire could rise without his aid?"
[time=2235] I think not.
[time=2237] "I therefore move," said Franklin, "that prayers employing the assistance of heaven be offered each day in this place before the conduction of our business."
[time=2248] And our constitution was born out of the wisdom of men who knew to seek God in prayer.
[time=2257] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it to 1 Timothy, chapter 2, and here we'll find in God's Word our instruction to be praying for our nation.
[time=2269] 1 Timothy 2, verse 1, "I urge them, first of all, that request, prayers, intercession, and thanksgiving be made for all people, for kings, for all in authority, that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and holiness."
[time=2295] This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=2306] For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men.
[time=2318] The testimony given in its proper time, and for this purpose, I was appointed a herald and an apostle.
[time=2327] I am telling the truth, I lie not, and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.
[time=2335] In this passage, it gives to us this premise for living, that as believers in Jesus Christ, it is God's first priority for us to be praying for our country.
[time=2349] Now you may think that's a rather grand statement to say first priority, but Paul said these words, "I urge first of all."
[time=2358] As we come to that phrase, first of all, it is not meant in priority of time, but in priority of function.
[time=2366] I'd like to suggest this thesis this morning, that the strength of the nation is the prayers of its people.
[time=2374] And the greatest thing you can do for our country is to pray for America.
[time=2380] Here is God's instruction, a first priority that we be men and women of prayer.
[time=2388] The instruction brings to us four different words for prayer.
[time=2393] The first three fit on this side of the ledger, and talk about all the things we ask God for.
[time=2399] The fourth term fits on this side of the ledger, being grateful for what God's already done.
[time=2404] These three words are requests. We've got that one down.
[time=2408] If you've forgotten what requests are like, just listen to your children or your grandchildren.
[time=2413] Requests are simply straightforward asking for something.
[time=2417] The next word is prayer, which is probably the most generic word in Scripture to talk about our conversation with God.
[time=2425] And the last word is intercession, one I want us to focus on.
[time=2430] Intercession is a combination of two Latin words put together.
[time=2434] The preposition inter, which means between, and the verb cateau, which means to go.
[time=2440] An intercessor is one who goes in between.
[time=2444] It's like the role the United States took under President Jimmy Carter, who saw the Arabs on this side,
[time=2450] and the Israelis on this side, and he saw the hostility in the war, and he went, and he stood in between, and he worked with Menachem Begin, and on Morcedot to bring about peace. He was an intercessor.
[time=2464] Somebody asked him how he knew which side to be on. He said it's quite simple.
[time=2469] Carter said that some of my friends are for this, the others are my friends are for that, and I am for my friends.
[time=2477] That's an intercessor, a person who loves this one, and someone who loves this one and says, I'll bring the two together.
[time=2485] I'll stand in between.
[time=2488] The Bible here commands us to look at our nation, and to recognize that our nation is in need of reconciliation with God,
[time=2497] and to stand between our God and our country, and to pray.
[time=2504] That's God's first agenda in what a country can do
[time=2510] or what a people can do for their country to intercede.
[time=2515] But then he balances out the ledger, not only asking and praying and interceding, but being thankful.
[time=2522] It's important that in our praying that we give thanks for at least these two reasons.
[time=2528] First of all, it pleases God that we express to him our gratitude for what he's already done.
[time=2534] And secondly, it does us a world of good.
[time=2537] If we only live over here with the ledger of God, I want this.
[time=2540] God, I need that. God, please enter this prayer, and God, I'm standing interceding for these.
[time=2546] We live on the one side of the ledger, and our focus will always become what we don't have.
[time=2552] If we spend an equal amount of time thanking God for what we do have, it changes our own outlook at life, it gives us a more positive disposition along with the most important priority, and that is pleasing God.
[time=2567] He says that we are to pray in this manner for all men, and then he particularly says the king, the king.
[time=2578] Timothy probably double-checked his scroll.
[time=2582] Paul didn't mean the king.
[time=2585] He meant the king.
[time=2587] You see, the king and Paul and Timothy's day was the madman Nero.
[time=2591] Nero was the individual who took the children of Christians, and he wrapped them up in animal skins, and then dripped blood on the animal skins and threw them to the lions.
[time=2602] Nero was the madman who impaled Christians while they were alive, and then dipped their bodies in oil, stuck them in a ground, and lit them as a human torch.
[time=2613] Pray for him.
[time=2616] Yes, pray for him.
[time=2619] As believers in Christ, we are to pray for our leaders, whether they are good leaders or bad leaders.
[time=2628] We're to pray for them whether they're despots or enlightened.
[time=2632] We're to pray for them whether they are out of a democratic government of the people or whether they are totalitarian.
[time=2639] We are to pray for them whether they embrace free enterprise or whether they hold to a communal system of socialism.
[time=2648] We are to pray for them.
[time=2652] One lady was asked why she prayed for the terrible leader of her land.
[time=2661] She confessed that the predecessor of that leader was a terrible man, and she prayed that God would remove him.
[time=2669] The man was removed from office, but the one who followed him was worse.
[time=2675] She says, "I'm praying for the guy we have now because if he leaves, it may get worse again." Whether we like our government, whether we like the leaders of the world,
[time=2689] we are responsible to pray for them, and not only those primary leaders,
[time=2695] but we are to pray for all who are in authority.
[time=2700] About three, maybe four times a week, someone will say, "Rick those doors out there and those are big, heavy doors." You know, you can get these nice little brass kick-down door stops.
[time=2712] They'll look nice, they'll hold the door almost.
[time=2714] But the fire marshal said, "We can't put those on our doors." "Oh, they won't care. Just put them in there." Well, I'd like to put those in there.
[time=2725] But we're at honor all who are in authority.
[time=2728] Not just the kings and the presidents, but the fire marshals.
[time=2732] You know, we're to honor the police officers who are in authority.
[time=2737] One of the tragic things that I find in talking to police officers who are a friend of mine, they tell that in our society they're not respected.
[time=2748] It used to be the radical friends who called them names in the late '60s, but now all of society looks at the police and holds them in contempt,
[time=2759] but there's no wonder because we hold our country in contempt.
[time=2767] Allow this editorial which cannot be found in the pages of 1 Timothy.
[time=2772] So if you don't like it, you can cross it out of the message.
[time=2777] But you know, we will never know of respect for authority and respects for king.
[time=2782] When we are so bent on personal self-gratification that we say, "I can do anything I want. I can defame anybody I want, and I can mock anything I want to mock, and my freedoms are so self-oriented that I can take a flag, the embodiment of a country, and I can disgrace it in defame it, and that's okay."
[time=2805] You see what is underlining all of that is the total disrespect for authority.
[time=2814] If there's anything we need to pray for, it is to pray that we will be a land that recognizes the value of authority and praise for authority, whether they be good ones or they be bad ones.
[time=2828] Now out of this passage, he gives to us three purposes to pray for authority.
[time=2834] The immediate purpose is to pray for authority that we might live a quiet and peaceful life.
[time=2839] It may mean here that he was praying in a very generic way that in the days of peace and in the days of prosperity, when all is going well, we all live a little better, we all live a little quieter, we don't have to worry about a threat from the outside or demonstrations on the inside of our country, life's a little better.
[time=2857] But it may mean that he was praying particularly that persecution would end.
[time=2861] He may be saying, "Pray for the king so that we, we being Christians, may live a quiet and peaceful life." We won't have to run to the catacombs to hide under persecution.
[time=2872] We won't have to ship our children to a different land because the Romans are making spectacles of them in the Colosseum.
[time=2879] But his immediate purpose was to pray for our government that there will be tranquility in our land.
[time=2886] But the ultimate purpose was to pray for this tranquility because it's God's will
[time=2893] for all to come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ as their Savior.
[time=2900] God's ultimate worldview is shaped around how can the most people be exposed to the gospel of Jesus Christ
[time=2911] so as many as possible will be saved.
[time=2915] There's a theological dilemma in this passage.
[time=2918] It says that it's God's will for all men to be saved.
[time=2923] Well, if God is a sovereign God and it's will for everybody to be saved, why are those who are not saved?
[time=2929] Theologians divide the will of God into two categories and it makes for logical and clear thinking.
[time=2936] Category number one is God's determined will.
[time=2940] There are things that God's determined this is going to happen and nothing is going to stop it.
[time=2946] God determined before the foundation of the world that Jesus Christ would die for our sins.
[time=2953] God determined before the foundation of the world that the dead body of Jesus would be resurrected alive again in the might of the Romans and the hostility of the Pharisees and the counsel of the Sanhedrin could not keep him in the tomb because it was God's determined will for him to rise again.
[time=2973] God also determined that he would establish a church and he said the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
[time=2980] There have been those in the era of the Inquisition who tried to burn all of the Bibles.
[time=2985] There were those like Nero and Diocletian and Marcus Aurelius who tried to stamp out Christianity.
[time=2992] There are those who tried to hem it outside of an iron curtain or a bamboo wall yet the Church of Jesus Christ exists in every one of those conditions because it was God's determined will.
[time=3006] But there's a second dimension to God's will.
[time=3008] It's God's desired will.
[time=3010] It's what God wants.
[time=3012] It's what comes out of his own heart.
[time=3014] But what he refuses to force are to determine.
[time=3019] It's simply what he communicates as his desire.
[time=3024] Amongst the desired will of God is the choice for you and me
[time=3031] to choose to accept Christ Jesus as our Savior or to reject him.
[time=3037] And the choice to walk in daily obedience to his word are the option of ignoring his word and closing him out of our lives.
[time=3048] He wants to know you personally.
[time=3051] He wants to be your Savior but he will only come upon your request.
[time=3057] He has not determined that one.
[time=3059] He only desires it.
[time=3062] The third purpose we have is known as the immediate purpose, the ultimate purpose of salvation but then a very personal purpose.
[time=3070] Paul said for this purpose, for this reason I am a herald.
[time=3077] I am an apostle.
[time=3079] I am an ambassador, one who declares this truth.
[time=3083] Now we come to another theological principle that we need to strongly declare today.
[time=3090] He uses the word truth repeatedly.
[time=3093] The first time it occurs is in verse 3.
[time=3096] This is good and pleases God our Savior who wants all men to be safe and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=3103] And then he declares the truth is there is one God and only one mediator
[time=3109] between man and God.
[time=3112] Over the last two generations we have made the truth an abstract concept.
[time=3118] That word truth is infuriated people of all times.
[time=3122] When Jesus mentioned it to Pilate he snapped what is truth.
[time=3128] And in our day we have relative philosophy, we have situational ethics and we see truth as relative.
[time=3136] But truth is not a matter of convention.
[time=3140] Truth is not a matter of majority rule.
[time=3144] Truth is not subjective.
[time=3146] It is not I feel or I think or I believe truth is concrete, not abstract.
[time=3155] Truth is objective, not subjective.
[time=3159] And truth is truth whether it is agreed to or not.
[time=3165] A teacher may give a question on a mathematical exam and say what is the square root of 64.
[time=3173] If the majority of students say 10, the square root of 64 does not become 10
[time=3181] because the majority of students say so.
[time=3185] And if the teacher says I've taught you better than this, the square root of 64 is not 10, it's 9.
[time=3193] It doesn't become 9 because the teacher declared it so.
[time=3198] The square root of 64 is 8.
[time=3204] And it will always be 8.
[time=3207] It's not relative, it's not subjective, it's not up for vote, and it's not up for decree.
[time=3215] Now the Bible says there's one God.
[time=3221] That's not up for vote today.
[time=3224] We can't say well you know there's a lot of people out there who believe that there are all kinds of different gods.
[time=3230] It doesn't matter how many people believe that.
[time=3233] Well I heard somebody else and they were a great philosopher and they said that God is, and they named another God.
[time=3239] It's not open to decree.
[time=3243] God is spoken and he says he is but one God.
[time=3248] And he takes truth further and he says there is one, not several, not even a few, but one mediator between man and God.
[time=3259] And he identifies him, the man Christ Jesus.
[time=3264] All roads may lead to Rome but all religions do not lead to God.
[time=3270] The Bible says there's one God and he is over there.
[time=3274] He is holy and he is righteous.
[time=3277] And there is humanity over here that is sinful and separated.
[time=3282] There is only one man who is able to grab humanity with this arm and grab deity with this arm.
[time=3290] And as the divine intercessor bring the two together and it is Christ Jesus.
[time=3295] How did he do it?
[time=3297] This passage tells us he did it by becoming the ransom.
[time=3302] The ransom is the price that is paid by those who are held captive.
[time=3306] The scriptures declare that all of humanity is held captive and the righteousness of God views that they are captive to sin and demands a payment.
[time=3316] And the payment would only be the spotless Lamb of God Jesus Christ.
[time=3323] O be glad, be glad, be glad, every sin that you ever had was paid up and fooled by the grace of the Lord.
[time=3334] O be glad, be glad.
[time=3338] Paul said I have a purpose in life.
[time=3341] My purpose is to declare, pray for our land so that we can declare Jesus Christ.
[time=3351] There is no place on the globe today nor has there ever been in time a land such as this where we can declare Jesus Christ.
[time=3361] Allow me to boil this down to three practical applications.
[time=3365] Application number one, become an intercessor.
[time=3369] Become one who will pray for our country.
[time=3373] The story is told I can't document it but I believe it's true of Pastor W.A. Chriswell of the famous first Baptist Church of Dallas meeting with a Korean pastor.
[time=3383] The Korean pastor humbly acknowledged when asked that he did pray for about three to four hours each morning.
[time=3390] Dr. Chriswell scratched his head and said, "Could I ask what you and the Lord talk about for three or four hours?"
[time=3397] And the Korean pastor said, "I pray for America.
[time=3401] I pray for your President and Vice President and their Cabinet.
[time=3405] I pray for everyone of your Senators by name." That's 100 of them.
[time=3410] And then this Korean said, "And then I pray for everyone of your Congressman by name."
[time=3417] That's 435 of them.
[time=3420] He wasn't even an American.
[time=3424] I'd like to ask you today to become an intercessor.
[time=3427] That's why in your Bible we have put this, Tim Teder, Sue Ward put this together for us.
[time=3432] I'd like to ask you to make a commitment to regularly praying for our country.
[time=3437] I'm going to confess to you, I'm not going to pray for 535 members of our National Legislature.
[time=3443] I'm not going to get up at four in the morning, but I am going to pray regularly.
[time=3448] You may want to pray for all these people each day.
[time=3450] You may not want to be that ambitious.
[time=3452] You may want to pray for this panel one day, this panel the next, the third to third day, and rotate, but would you pray for America?
[time=3459] It's the greatest thing you could do for our country is to be an intercessor and to pray.
[time=3467] We make this available to you here.
[time=3470] We're making it available to the people who watch the Bible hour because the Bible says, first of all, I urge the prayers be made in behalf of everyone for kings and for all who are in authority.
[time=3488] I believe today that most spiritual thing that you and I could do and the most patriotic thing we could do would be to pray for America.
[time=3505] We've been sharing with you this morning the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir
[time=3518] and special guests sounds alive and soloist Ron Mapes.
[time=3522] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3525] Just before we close, if you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3533] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3535] Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3543] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3547] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and cleanse me today.
[time=3552] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3556] If you prayed that prayer, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3560] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
