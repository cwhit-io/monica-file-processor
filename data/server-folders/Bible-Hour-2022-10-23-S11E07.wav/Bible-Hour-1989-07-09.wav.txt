[time=113] Roy Riggles rushed his way into college football fame.
[time=117] That was quite an accomplishment because Roy was a lineman, not a running back.
[time=122] He earned his fame on one single play.
[time=125] When he picked up a loose ball fumble and he scrambled down the field over 90 yards, his long legs allowed him to out distance most of his opponents.
[time=136] Just short of the goal line, he was stopped, tackled by his own teammate.
[time=141] You see, Roy had picked up the fumble and ran in the wrong direction.
[time=146] That single run earned him fame and the name "wrong way" Riggles.
[time=152] Many of us are like Roy.
[time=154] We're making great stride.
[time=156] We're making good distance, but it's in the wrong direction.
[time=162] (dramatic music)
[time=174] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=178] Thank you for joining us.
[time=180] Today on the Bible Hour, Rick's challenge is to run the real race.
[time=184] Many of us are like Roy Riggles.
[time=186] We're making great progress, but it's in the wrong direction.
[time=188] It was Jesus who said, "What does it profit a man if he gains the world but loses his soul?" God has a plan for our lives, a race for us to run.
[time=198] Are you on track with God's will for your life?
[time=200] How you run your race is so important because you are part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=204] Rick's message today has that title as its theme.
[time=208] Running the real race, remembering you are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=212] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Hebrews, Chapter 12.
[time=218] Rick's text is taken from Verses 1 and 2.
[time=222] This sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=226] Other special music includes an instrumental solo from Scott Jindler and a solo from Kevin Rowe.
[time=234] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=242] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=246] Now, here's Rick.
[time=250] Thank you.
[time=252] Thank you and you may be seated.
[time=254] We're delighted to have you worshiping with us here at Black Hawk if this is your first time.
[time=260] We hope you've been made to feel welcome from the time you hit the parking lot.
[time=264] If you've been here a hundred times, we hope you've made them feel welcome, but you feel like you're at home as well.
[time=270] We want to welcome our friends who are joining us for the Bible Hour and trust that if you're in a hospital room or in a prison cell or home bound that God's word today would reach your heart.
[time=280] And that music that lifts up the name of Jesus might take all of our hearts and lift them above the burdens of life, and we would see the Lord Jesus.
[time=290] The Bible tells us that he was not anything to look at, but that he was despised and rejected.
[time=298] But because of what he has done in dying for the cross, he has become our beautiful Savior.
[time=304] I know you'll enjoy, but I hope you'll also be ministered to as you hear our choir sing, "Beautiful Savior."
[time=316] "Beautiful Savior, King of creation,
[time=336] Son of God and Son of man.
[time=348] Truly, I love thee.
[time=362] Light of my soul, my joy, my crown."
[time=380] There are the meadows.
[time=398] Jesus is pure.
[time=428] "Beautiful Savior, Lord of the nations,
[time=438] Son of God and Son of man.
[time=450] Glory and honor.
[time=454] Praise and glory, Son of man.
[time=464] Glory and honor, Son of man.
[time=494] Especially appreciate the fact that the passage in there says
[time=506] that he makes our sorrowing hearts to sing.
[time=510] That's exactly why we congregate together to praise the name of the Lord and to be encouraged even though we might have some sorrow today in our lives.
[time=518] Let's continue on the theme of our Savior and His name.
[time=520] Let's it be the name of the Lord, Him number 103, Him number 103.
[time=528] Praise and glory, Son of man.
[time=570] Let's it be the name of the Lord.
[time=660] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=662] We are also very appreciative of our accompanist, Darlene Johnson, who is very faithful in our piano and Scott Schindler around the organ.
[time=670] Often they are accompanying us, but today we've asked Scott Schindler to play a special piece on the organ.
[time=678] Let's listen now as he ministers to us.
[time=708] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=898] It is a great privilege for us to have you joining us by way of television today.
[time=902] Pete, the Panorama's over with, but I wanted to say thank you for the patriotic Panorama and just the great impact that had on the Bible hour.
[time=910] Well, thank you, Rick. It was a joy to have sounds alive back in our choir just looking beautiful and singing.
[time=914] It's not often I say a lot about them, but I'm just so pleased of our people. They give of their time sacrificially and they love the Lord and love our country and express that, I think, in the patriotic Panorama.
[time=926] Oh, they do. And many of you have expressed to me as we've met at the malls of Fort Wayne or at various functions at the Three Rivers Festival.
[time=934] Just met some people yesterday who were Bible hour viewers. Thank you for taking the time to tell us how much you do appreciate the choir and various parts of our ministry.
[time=944] In the next few months, we are going to be putting together a special Bible hour video in that we would like to tell your story, not just our story, but your story.
[time=954] Over the years, many of you have already written to us and told us that you accepted Christ as a result of this broadcast.
[time=962] You made a significant spiritual decision. Our God's Word helped you out of a period of depression.
[time=968] How has God's Word, through the Bible, helped you?
[time=972] Could we ask you to do us a favor and take the time and write us a letter this week so that we could have a record of that and perhaps use it in our Bible hour video?
[time=980] Even if you wrote us a year ago, our two months ago and told us the story.
[time=984] Write again to refresh our mind and so we can have that letter on our hand as we put together the Bible hour video.
[time=990] We hope that you'll take just a few moments to tell us how God's Word through this ministry has impacted your life.
[time=998] Pete, would you give our friends the address?
[time=1000] Yes, we'd like you to write today to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1010] Once again, send your testimony to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1020] And while you're writing to us to give us your testimony, please request a little pamphlet we put together for this month of July that is a prayer card to remind us to be praying for our nation.
[time=1034] 1 Timothy, chapter 2 tells us that it's God's will for us to pray for leaders for all men, especially kings and those in authority.
[time=1044] Well, we don't have a king here in America, but we do have a president, a vice president, a Congress and a Supreme Court for whom we should be regularly in prayer.
[time=1054] This little publication is four panels it gives to us, most of the leaders of our national government, for those of us who are Hoosiers at least, and also some of the area officials, the Indiana governor and the Indiana lieutenant governor and Supreme Court, all are given you there so that you could daily pray for them.
[time=1074] So as you write, we do ask you to request this and become a prayer partner praying for our nation.
[time=1082] This is a helpful pamphlet and we'd like you to write for it today, right to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1094] We have an invitation for you friends in the greater Fort Wayne area. During the month of August on Wednesday nights, again this year we're offering what we call the practical living seminar.
[time=1104] We'll have about 10 different seminars led by people who by nature of their education or employment have a level of expertise in a given field.
[time=1114] For example, Dr. Jack Clark is going to talk about our body and health and he does a wonderful job of just taking the good old practical sense that he has as a doctor, combining it with biblical principles so that we'll take better care of our bodies.
[time=1130] We'll have a seminar on sex in your marriage. Many married couples are struggling because of sexual problems.
[time=1136] The Bible is not a book that holds back secrets. Text like Song of Solomon tells us that God has made us for sexual fulfillment within the parameters of marriage.
[time=1148] We'll have 10 different seminars like these on the Wednesday nights of August and we want to invite you to come and join with us.
[time=1156] We'll be spread out on our campus. Some of them will be here in the worship center. Some will be across the street in the old building.
[time=1162] And we'll look forward to you coming at 7 o'clock Wednesday nights in August.
[time=1168] Thank you again for joining us here today on the Bible Hour. Again, we're asking you to write to us.
[time=1172] Share a word of testimony how the Bible Hour has influenced your life spiritually. We want to include your story.
[time=1180] Perhaps you'll want us to do it anonymously. We'd be glad to, but we want to give your story in this special presentation.
[time=1186] We'll also have the prayer brochure for you. Pete, would you share the address one final time?
[time=1192] Our address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana. The zip code is 46815.
[time=1202] Thank you and thank you for joining us today here for the Bible Hour.
[time=1218] As I look back on this road, I've traveled. I've seen so many times he's carried me through.
[time=1232] And if there's one thing that I put in my life, My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1246] My Redeemer is faithful and true. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1262] Everything he has said he will do.
[time=1270] Every morning his mercy's on you.
[time=1278] My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1290] My heart rejoices when I read the promise.
[time=1298] There is a place I am preparing for you.
[time=1306] I know someday I'll see my heart face to face, 'cause My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1320] My Redeemer is faithful and true. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1334] Everything he has said he will do.
[time=1342] And every morning his mercy's on you.
[time=1350] My Redeemer is faithful and true. And in every situation he has proved his love to me.
[time=1366] When I lack the understanding he gives more grace to me. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1384] Everything he has said he will do. And every morning his mercy's on you.
[time=1400] My Redeemer is faithful and true. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1430] Our Lord Jesus we worship you this morning. You are our Redeemer. You are faithful and true.
[time=1450] And we come to this place today to worship you. We know our inadequacy, our shortcomings and sins.
[time=1458] And we begin our prayer of worship by asking you to cleanse us, to wash us and to renew us.
[time=1464] We ask you to take the rebellion and the indifference, the active aggression and the passive apathy of this past week
[time=1474] and to wash it all away to make us new. We confess to you our corporate and individual sin.
[time=1482] And we do today ask for the shed blood of Jesus to take it away.
[time=1488] We ask you to return to us the joy of our salvation. Make us do no gladness.
[time=1494] Even as the choir has sung this morning, give us a song in the midst of life's pain.
[time=1500] We would pray this morning for Debbie Moore and her family and the tragic loss of her brother
[time=1506] that you would give to them confidence and strength today to move on in life.
[time=1514] We'd pray for Florent Torrerak and Colin Lister that your hand would be upon their lives and restore them to health
[time=1520] and comfort those that love those men. We would pray today for a little Benji Snyder
[time=1528] that you would give his body the ability to recover from the devastating accident
[time=1534] that his little leg would mend and his bruises would heal.
[time=1538] We would pray this morning that you would heal broken lives.
[time=1542] Those who are battling the dark enemy of depression.
[time=1544] Father, would you give them the strength that it takes to take one step towards healing
[time=1550] for those who are enslaved by their own habits?
[time=1554] Would you give them the power to live this day victorious and then with tomorrow a new spiritual power?
[time=1560] We pray with those whose families are fractured or deteriorating.
[time=1564] That you would give them a priority of putting home ahead of every other care of this world.
[time=1572] We'd ask that you would turn the hearts of fathers towards home.
[time=1578] We would ask you today to give strength and commitment to those who name the name of Christ
[time=1584] that as believers we might walk in obedience.
[time=1588] And now as we study your word, we ask you to make it come alive.
[time=1592] We want it to be more than literature, more than religion, but milk and meat,
[time=1598] food for our soul and strength for the very countenance of our face.
[time=1604] We ask it for our sake and for Jesus' sake, amen.
[time=1610] If you have a Bible this morning, I invite you to open it to Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[time=1616] If you're new to Blackhawk or new to Bible study, please don't feel awkward if you can't find Hebrews.
[time=1622] At the beginning of probably every Bible that's ever been published is a table of contents
[time=1628] that will help you find the passage.
[time=1630] Hebrews is probably two-thirds of the way back through the New Testament towards the end of the entire Bible.
[time=1638] If you're a graduate of IU, it goes chapter 10, then chapter 11, and then chapter 12, a Purdue grad would be glad to help you find Hebrews chapter 12.
[time=1650] I had to say that because I'm going to get the IU people just a little later today.
[time=1656] In Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2 is a passage that we made home plate for our program here we call Celebrate God's Grace.
[time=1666] And during this month of July, we want to recapture that spiritual fervor that we had two-and-a-half years ago.
[time=1674] And so what I want to do during the next several Sundays is take this passage that was our launching pad
[time=1680] and look at it more deeply than we did the day we first claimed this verse as a landmark for a program that eventually allowed us to build this building.
[time=1690] Here's Hebrews 12, 1 and 2 in the new international version.
[time=1694] Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders
[time=1702] and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance.
[time=1708] The race marked out for us.
[time=1712] Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[time=1720] Who, for the joy set before him, endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1732] Hebrews 12, 1 and 2.
[time=1736] Out of this passage two-and-a-half years ago I had the privilege of sharing four principles for you on this theme running the real race.
[time=1746] I want to give you an overview of those four principles and then today we'll study one.
[time=1750] Here are the four principles. Principal number one, we are to run remembering we are part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=1762] God has always had a people, someone who would carry the baton, someone who would run for him.
[time=1768] There have been generations after generations of people who would follow God like a continuous relay team and it's now our turn to run.
[time=1778] Principal number two is we are to release anything that hinders us from running well.
[time=1784] Like the athlete who takes off the warm-up and strips down to the bare essentials so that there's nothing that holds him back.
[time=1792] We are so too to release anything that holds us back from full-fledged service to Christ.
[time=1800] Principal number three is we are to refuse to quit, refuse to quit.
[time=1808] With all the rights pressure, with all the voices outside or the ones on the inside that say,
[time=1816] I've got to quit, I've had enough, run with perseverance, refuse to quit.
[time=1824] And then the fourth principle is remained focused on Jesus, looking unto Jesus, the author and the perfecter of our faith,
[time=1834] who endured it all, crossing everything, remained focused on him.
[time=1840] Well this morning I want to do something that we almost never do in the life of our church.
[time=1846] We're going to ask two groups of people to stand up and you're going to be in one of those two groups.
[time=1850] I know some of you are elbowing your wife and you're saying, see, I told you, don't go to that church, they're going to make us stand up, they're going to embarrass us.
[time=1858] We don't do that regularly.
[time=1860] And if you're a first-time visitor here, we never say, well all the first-time visitors please stand up so we can stare at you and your children.
[time=1868] We won't do that, but we want to visualize something today.
[time=1872] So I'm going to ask two groups to stand up, you'll be in one of those groups.
[time=1876] If you are not a part of our church, prior to January of 1987, when Celebrate God's Grace began, we want you to stay seated.
[time=1886] But if you were a part prior to '87, we want you to stand.
[time=1890] So it's kind of old-timers. Now if you were a part of Blackhawk before January of '87, would you stand right now?
[time=1898] That should be most of you, but it's not all of you. Good.
[time=1900] Now just remain standing, those old-timers here, just remain standing if you're personally committing $2 million to the next building program.
[time=1910] You can sit down, that's good.
[time=1912] All right. Good. Now we're the old-timers. Would you now stand please? If you're new to Blackhawk in the last two years since Celebrate God's Grace began, would you all stand right now?
[time=1922] Again, we're not trying to embarrass you. There'll be dozens of you. Maybe more than 100 in this service.
[time=1926] There were many in last service. Thanks. You can be seated now.
[time=1930] We wanted you to see though, that because of an endeavor of a body of people to move out of a crowded gymnasium to build an auditorium, just since Celebrate God's Grace began.
[time=1940] There are many who have come and found Blackhawk to be home.
[time=1944] Well these are principles out of God's word we want to recapture today. Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[time=1952] Principle number one is this. Remember that you are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=1962] But that phrase is simply a modifying phrase that describes how we are to run. The key statement in these two verses is this one.
[time=1972] Let us run the race that is marked out before us.
[time=1978] In this whole passage, the central instruction, the main thing that God is saying is that he's got a race.
[time=1986] He has got a challenge for you and for me, and he's marked that race out, and it's so important that we run the right race in the right direction.
[time=2000] In football history, there are a lot of great college running backs. There's the famous Ernie Davis out of Syracuse, the first one to wear number 44.
[time=2010] Great running back, followed by Jim Brown. Out of that tradition, there were great college running backs all the way down to O.J. Simpson, Eric Dickerson.
[time=2022] All of those men carried the ball hundreds and hundreds of times to earn their place in the record book.
[time=2030] But there was one man who only carried the ball one time and earned his way into college football history.
[time=2038] His name was Roy Regals. Roy didn't get to carry the ball except for one time because he was a defensive man.
[time=2046] The other team was right down at his goal line, and he dug in, and his team dug in, and when they ran the ball, Roy ran right in there as a defensive man.
[time=2054] They popped the running back, the ball came squirting loose right in front of Roy, and he picked up the ball.
[time=2060] He took off with those long legs, making big strides, racing down the field. He could hear the fans cheering, and the more they cheered, the harder Roy ran.
[time=2070] And he outran everybody but one guy who tackled him on the two-yard line. It was his own team member.
[time=2078] Roy had picked up the ball and ran over 90 yards in the wrong direction, and has earned the name "wrong way" Regals.
[time=2086] How many of us are like Roy? We're covering a lot of ground. We're getting ahead of the pack, but we're running in the wrong direction.
[time=2096] It was Jesus who said, "What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?"
[time=2104] "What does it profit us if we get a career promotion, but our spiritual life is the price we pay?"
[time=2114] "What does it matter whether our business is showing an increased productivity, but our spiritual life is producing no fruit of the Spirit of God?"
[time=2124] "What does it profit us if we enter the record book of our profession, and yet we don't have our name recorded in God's book of life?"
[time=2136] The Bible says God has a race that he has marked out for us. It's the consistent habit of New Testament writers to illustrate the Christian life with the arena of athletics.
[time=2148] This is one of those passages where our faith in Jesus Christ and our commitment to serving him is compared to the discipline and the devotion of an athlete.
[time=2160] There's a race that God has for us. If you'll turn back two chapters to Hebrews, chapter 10, you'll find a description of that race that God has for you and for me.
[time=2174] Hebrews 10, verse 32 says this, "Remember those earlier days after you had received the light when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering.
[time=2192] Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution. At other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
[time=2202] You sympathized with those in prison, and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
[time=2216] So do not throw away your confidence. It will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you've done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.
[time=2230] For in just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay. But my righteous one will live by faith, and if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him.
[time=2248] But we are not those who shrink back and are destroyed, but those who believe and are saved." Here's the historical situation.
[time=2258] The book gets its name Hebrews because there were a group of Hebrew Jewish people who had come to faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2268] They'd signed up for this relay team. And as the gun went off, they charged out of the blocks. They were willing to serve Christ. They were themselves and persecuted.
[time=2280] Some of them had been put to death. Others of them had their property confiscated. Well, if you're a Christian, you don't belong to this community, and their public image was taken away in all that they held confiscated.
[time=2294] Others did not necessarily go through that, but they were still believers in Christ, and they sympathized, and they cared, and they shared what they had with those who had it taken away. They were off to a great start.
[time=2310] But they had hoped that Jesus was coming back right then. I mean now, and he hadn't come back. It had been decades. It's probably been somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 years that Jesus hasn't come back, and some of them were beginning to say, "I don't know if I can run any longer.
[time=2330] I don't know if I can keep up this pace." Others said, "I want out." They were contemplating quitting, and some did.
[time=2342] And the whole theme of Hebrews is this one. It's too soon to quit. Keep running. Maintain your stride. Don't give up your faith.
[time=2354] Hang in there in the midst of persecution. Remember how you started? Finish strong. God has marked out a race for us, and the race that God has for each of us is simply this.
[time=2368] To receive Jesus Christ is our Savior, and to walk in a life of unquestioned obedience to Him, and to never defect, to never give up, to no no retreat.
[time=2384] Hebrews 12 brings all of that book to a crescendo by saying, "Run the race." And he describes how we're to run with four statements. The first is our study today.
[time=2398] Run. Remembering you are a part of God's eternal relay team. Where do we get that expression? Out of the very first clause of verse 1, it says, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, you may have never been a runner or a swimmer, but no doubt you've been to the athletic games.
[time=2428] In the athletic games at the very center, the attention is drawn to the athlete who is competing, but around him is an ever-increasing circle of spectators who are watching.
[time=2444] And closest of all the spectators are his own team members. The team is always positioned right there on the sidelines, in the dugouts, on the bench, right at the line of play.
[time=2460] And if you've ever been to an athletic contest when it's close, all the fans will be cheering and the cheerleaders will be doing their job, but no one, no one cheers on the athlete like his former teammates who have already played their part in the game.
[time=2482] The Bible says that we, as believers in Jesus Christ, are surrounded right now by those who have already run their race.
[time=2492] That begins with this word "therefore," which is a connective conjunction that ties Hebrews chapter 12 back to chapter 11 as one continuous thought.
[time=2504] Someone has rightly called Hebrews 11 "God's Hall of Fame." And as you read through Hebrews chapter 11, if you have any type of background in the Bible at all, these are familiar names, Noah, David, Moses, Abraham.
[time=2520] I mean, these are the who's who? And what Hebrews chapter 11 is painting is a picture of an eternal relay team where one generation, perhaps one man or one woman, served Jesus Christ.
[time=2536] And throughout their life they were faithful to the very end, and then like a runner finishing his leg of the relay, they stretch out the baton, the place it in the hand of the next runner.
[time=2548] And so we see in Abraham living for Christ and putting the baton in the hands of an Isaac, and an Isaac living for God and putting the baton in the hand of Jacob, Jacob running for God and putting it in the hand of Joseph.
[time=2564] Hebrews 11 gives us that portrait of men and women who followed Christ. They followed Christ at great consequence. Noah went out into a place where it had never rained before and said, "Anybody want to help me build an ark? It's going to flood."
[time=2584] Now, if you live down in Lakeside Park and it's springtime and the snow is melding, you've probably thought about building an ark. But could you imagine going out into the Mojave Desert, saying to people who live out there at the very edge of the desert at a little spring, went out and we built an ark, it's going to flood this spring.
[time=2602] I'm going to flood this spring in the Mojave Desert. Have you ever thought of counseling? You know, I believe there's hope for people like you. I'm sure somebody could help you.
[time=2612] They thought Noah was out of his mind, but he'd follow God. Abraham. God called him to obedience and to follow him. And Abraham had to look across the table, to family, a large family, and say, "I'm leaving home."
[time=2632] Where are you going? I don't know. You're leaving home and you don't know where you're going. How will you know when you get there? God will tell me. Oh, God will tell you.
[time=2646] Abraham, you're too religious. Just let this God thing cool down. Just stay at home. You're part of the family. Don't rock the boat.
[time=2658] Moses, by faith. When he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. Hey, Moses, think about it.
[time=2668] You're not really an Israelite. Maybe you were born in Israelite, but you're one of us now.
[time=2674] You're an Egyptian. Hey, Moses, play your cards right. Everything's going to be on a roll for you. Just don't rock the boat.
[time=2684] But by faith, you follow God.
[time=2690] Let me draw your attention to the heroes that go unnamed in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 33.
[time=2702] Verse 32 ends with some well-known names of Samson and David and Samuel and the prophets.
[time=2710] And it talks about their conquest, their victory in Christ. Verse 33, who through faith conquered kingdoms?
[time=2716] Hey, I do remember that. You remember a little David? I mean, he took a slingshot out there and he killed Goliath and he routed the whole Philistine army.
[time=2724] Hey, this following God stuff's okay.
[time=2730] Conquered kingdoms, administered justice, gained what was promised, who shut the mouths of the lions. Hey, that's right.
[time=2740] Remember Daniel? They threw him in the lions then and God locked the jaw of the lions and he was victorious.
[time=2746] This following God stuff's okay after all.
[time=2750] They quenched the flurry of the flames. Hey, Shadrach, Meshach, Nabendigo. God took care of him right in the fiery furnace.
[time=2758] This following God, that's a good plan. I guess I will live by faith.
[time=2764] Escape the edge of the sword, whose weakness was turned to strength and routed foreign armies.
[time=2770] Women receive back their dead, raised to life again. Elijah, the widow's son is dead, but Elijah stretches his body over him three times and the boy comes back to life.
[time=2786] Now those that now look and they say, wow, it does pay to follow God. Look at that. By faith these people were victorious and that is true.
[time=2798] But look at the next verse as well.
[time=2802] Others were tortured and refused to be released. No victory here.
[time=2812] No overcoming the enemy. No lions would lock jaw. They were tortured.
[time=2818] They faced the urge to quit and refused so that they might gain a better resurrection.
[time=2826] Some faced jeers and flogging. While still others were chained and put in prison, they were stoned.
[time=2834] They were solved in two. They were put to death by the sword.
[time=2842] Faith in God, faith in Jesus Christ doesn't guarantee us. Everything will work out. Wonderful.
[time=2852] It will always turn out okay.
[time=2856] Yes, there were those who lived by faith and brought down kingdoms and were found victorious.
[time=2862] There were others who God's will was for them to live by faith and to die for their faith.
[time=2868] To suffer for their faith.
[time=2874] It says they went about in sheepskins and goatskins. The world was not worthy of them.
[time=2882] They wandered in deserts and in mountains. They lived in caves and in holes of the ground.
[time=2886] There was no one saying to them by way of television, "You just send us $66."
[time=2892] Much God multiplied tenfold and God will give you your rich abundance of heaven's treasure raining down upon you.
[time=2900] No theology of prosperity. They just lived in holes in the ground in caves. They were destitute. They had nothing.
[time=2914] God says, "I've got people on both sides of the ledger.
[time=2918] I've got those people on this side of the ledger who have followed me and I chose to lift them up and make them victorious."
[time=2928] God said, "And others suffered. And others were destitute and others died and they were my people as well."
[time=2936] Look at the esteem that God places on them. He says, "The world was not worthy of them."
[time=2944] Oh, the world says, "You're different. You're odd. You don't fit into our religious structure. We're going to persecute you.
[time=2952] You're not worthy to be of us." And God says, "That's right. They're not the same as you.
[time=2960] But you are the ones unworthy and they deserve better." Verse 39, "They were commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised."
[time=2974] What had been promised? These people lived.
[time=2978] They suffered because God promised that Messiah would come and when Messiah would come, He would be victorious over their enemies.
[time=2986] And a Jeremiah could be in the shackles and He could have them come by and taunt him.
[time=2992] And they would say, "Mego'em as a beeb. It's Hebrew for terror on every side.
[time=2998] Jeremiah predicted terror on every side." And they said, "You want terror? We'll give it to you, buddy." And they mocked him.
[time=3006] Jeremiah hung on because he said, "Believe God will send Messiah who will reign and rule."
[time=3012] Isaiah is probably the one who was solved in two. He was not the one that said, "Messiah will come and he will rule, but he didn't come."
[time=3024] These people didn't receive the promise. And yet they were found faithful.
[time=3032] Why? Why didn't Messiah come?
[time=3036] Verse 39, "God had planned something better for us so that only together with us they could be made perfect."
[time=3044] God said, "I've got a bigger plan than just Jeremiah and just Isaiah.
[time=3048] I've got a bigger plan than that group of people that we call the Old Testament believers."
[time=3054] God said, "I've got you, Hebrew Christians. I've got you, people of Blackhawk, that I wanted to win."
[time=3062] And so together I'll bring about the perfection of the kingdom.
[time=3066] God said, "I've got some more runners on this relay team." And so Hebrews chapter 11 exists so that as we now serve Jesus Christ,
[time=3078] we will see those that were persecuted, those that were destitute, those that were martyred,
[time=3084] and we will see that we now carry the baton in our hands.
[time=3090] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=3100] Here today are those of you who are followers of Christ in your contemplating defection.
[time=3108] Others of us are flirting at this very moment with compromise.
[time=3112] You followed Christ, you were enthusiastic, you were spontaneous, but it hasn't all panned out what you thought it would be.
[time=3122] You thought if you came to Christ, you had a wonderful plan for your life which meant that everything else would be wonderful.
[time=3130] And now you're facing the hard times and defections are real possibility.
[time=3138] Some of you are today contemplating defection because of your family.
[time=3144] They've called you the religious one in the family, and it seemed to be that they always had family get togethers on Saturdays,
[time=3150] and now that you've become a Christian, somehow they've mysteriously switched those to Sundays,
[time=3156] and you know they're just pricking at you to see if you'll be so religious that you won't miss church.
[time=3164] Every time they get a chance they sink a little barb in, they dig a little deeper,
[time=3170] and you've been made to feel the outsider in your family.
[time=3174] You're saying maybe I ought to just compromise.
[time=3178] Maybe I ought to just, well maybe keep my faith in Christ, but just never say anything anymore, just do it the old way.
[time=3186] Some of you are law enforcement officers, and it's pretty clearly told to you on the force, we don't need anything.
[time=3194] We're real men. Religion is for the weak.
[time=3202] And you've tried to share your faith in Christ, and you have been jeered, you have been mocked, and they have called you names, the religious one, the preacher in the group.
[time=3214] And you're saying, oh maybe I ought to just shut up.
[time=3218] Maybe I ought to just cam the whole thing. Maybe I ought to just be one of the boys in the department.
[time=3226] Some of you have tried to share Christ in your neighborhood at a picnic, at the park, at the neighborhood swimming pool.
[time=3232] And it used to be that when you went to the pool, there were a whole group of them, you just walk up and join right in,
[time=3238] and now they have let you know that your spiritual life, your conversations about God,
[time=3244] you're nagging, inviting them to the singing tree, whatever that may be.
[time=3248] It's gotten to be a little too much.
[time=3252] And if you want to fit in, then you better fit in.
[time=3256] And you thought, yeah maybe I ought to just fit in.
[time=3260] Maybe I ought to just bag this whole religious thing.
[time=3266] Some of you have served Jesus, and you've prayed.
[time=3270] You've prayed for a loved one to come to Christ, and they haven't.
[time=3274] You prayed for a loved one to live, and they died.
[time=3278] You prayed for a son that he would return, and he's straight further.
[time=3284] You're saying, God, if that's how it is, I want to quit.
[time=3290] And God says, remember, Abraham.
[time=3296] Remember Isaiah? Remember Paul.
[time=3300] Remember Pauli Karp of Smyrna, who was burned at the stake?
[time=3306] Remember Martin Luther, who was so plagued by depression.
[time=3310] He said, there was a black dog after me.
[time=3314] Remember the assaults that he had of Satan that he actually picked up an ink bottle, and he hurled it because he thought Satan was there.
[time=3320] And the temptation to the effect was so great.
[time=3324] But God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=3334] And today the baton is in your hand. It's in mind.
[time=3338] It's in mind not because I'm a pastor or a preacher.
[time=3342] It's mine because I'm a believer in Christ, and it is equally yours to run for him, to serve him.
[time=3354] And God wants us today, as we think about serving Jesus Christ, not only to remember all those who lived hundreds of years ago, but to think of those who have served this Christ that we now serve faithfully.
[time=3368] Or to think of a Mary Lantman who refused to quit, of a Bessie Blakely who was gracious even in her dying bed, of a Jean McCoy who died in the saddle, sharing Christ in an evangelism explosion class.
[time=3382] Or to think of widows in this church who have overcome loneliness.
[time=3386] Or to think of ladies in this church who have lived with husbands who are unfaithful.
[time=3390] Or to think of men in this church who have lived through the rejection and the loss of their job because of their testimony for Christ.
[time=3398] And where to keep running?
[time=3400] Notre Dame was a great football team before Newt Rockney ever got there.
[time=3406] But when he took over the team he said he had everything that the team needed except for a kid who could carry the mail.
[time=3410] That was the rocks way of saying he needed a running back.
[time=3414] And nobody seemed to be able to carry the ball on that 1919 Notre Dame team.
[time=3418] And while the team was practicing there a bunch of collegents over to the side watching, passing their own ball around having a flag football game of sorts.
[time=3426] And Rockney saw this one kid named George kick the ball and he said he'd never seen anybody kick the ball like that.
[time=3432] And he went over and he talked to the young man.
[time=3434] He asked him if he thought he could play football and run.
[time=3438] He liked the strength of his legs.
[time=3440] The kids that he'd never played but he tried Newt Rockney suited up George Gip that day and he became the greatest running back of that era.
[time=3448] George Gip that year ran the ball and Notre Dame ran undefeated.
[time=3454] In one of the games Rockney had been the victim of a separated dislocated shoulder.
[time=3460] They didn't know that's what it was at the time.
[time=3462] They took him out and the team went behind.
[time=3466] They were overpowered by a powerful team out of Bloomington, Indiana called the Hoosiers.
[time=3472] The Hoosiers had him down ten to six.
[time=3474] Two plays left in the game.
[time=3476] They send the wounded Gip back in and he dives into the line knocked down at the line of scrimmage.
[time=3482] He picks his arm back up.
[time=3484] They call his number again and George Gip with the gun going off powers his way into the end zone.
[time=3490] George Gip overcame everything but pneumonia.
[time=3494] He died during his senior year.
[time=3498] Just before he died he said this to Newt Rockney.
[time=3502] Coach someday when the team is finding the going rough.
[time=3504] When the boys are getting left tell them to fight back with all they've got.
[time=3510] Tell them to win one for the Gipper.
