[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] The biblical definition of sin is to miss the mark back when the San Francisco Giants were the New York Giants they were playing a game for the National League pennant Fred Merkel was up the bat and the win the game he knocked a home run out of the ballpark and on his triumphant trot around the bases Fred missed second base.
[time=119] He was disqualified.
[time=121] He missed the mark, failed to score the run and lost the pennant.
[time=127] Missing the mark in life can disqualify us.
[time=132] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled "Running the Real Race Part 2." Out of bounds, fall start, illegal punch, lane violation, fall ball, overweight, and a ball ball.
[time=161] Anabolic steroids. The athlete knows that he must compete according to the rules. He is well aware that his performance is being watched by the umpire referee or official.
[time=172] To win, he must not get disqualified. He has to touch all the bases. God has called us to run for him. Like the athlete, we too must run according to the rules.
[time=182] We invite you to study with us today as we examine how God wants us to run.
[time=188] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Hebrews chapter 12.
[time=193] Rick's text is taken from verses 1 and 2. The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=201] Other special music includes a solo from Brian Lowson and Starr Braddock.
[time=209] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=218] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=222] Now, here's Rick.
[time=225] Welcome you this morning. We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=231] Our purpose today is to glorify Jesus Christ because of who he is and what he has done.
[time=238] In the book of Hebrews, it tells us this in Hebrews 922, without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sin.
[time=247] God is holy, he is just, and he has only one payment for sin.
[time=253] And that is the powerful blood of Jesus Christ. It alone can forgive our sins.
[time=259] Our choir sings that truth to us. There is power in the blood.
[time=268] There is power. There is power.
[time=279] What can wash away my sins?
[time=283] What can make me whole again?
[time=287] And what it shows me that the victory I'll win, there is power.
[time=292] Power in the blood of God.
[time=298] Would you be free from the burden of sin?
[time=302] There is power in the blood, there is power in the blood.
[time=307] Would you over me hold a mighty victory with?
[time=311] There is under-working power in the blood.
[time=317] There is power. There is under-working power.
[time=322] There is power in the blood of God.
[time=325] There is power. There is under-working power.
[time=329] There is blood of the blood.
[time=334] What can wash in the blood of the world?
[time=339] Are you feeling interested in this racist song?
[time=343] What can wash in the blood of the world?
[time=349] There is power. There is power. There is power in the blood of the world.
[time=357] There is power. There is under-working power in the precious blood of the sin.
[time=367] You'll be washed in the blood of the man.
[time=371] There is a mountain, the wind of the storm.
[time=375] Are you washed in the blood of the land?
[time=381] Are you washed in the blood?
[time=385] There is a mountain, the wind of the storm.
[time=398] There is power in the blood of the man.
[time=516] There is wonder where King Paul is.
[time=520] There is power in the blood of the man.
[time=531] There is wonder where King Paul is.
[time=534] There is power in the blood of the man.
[time=536] There is wonder where King Paul is.
[time=537] There is power in the blood of the man.
[time=538] There is wonder where King Paul is.
[time=539] There is power in the blood of the man.
[time=846] Hello again, we've just broken away from our morning worship service to record just a brief segment to talk directly with you friends who join us each week for the Bible hour.
[time=858] It's our desire and purpose to share our church service with you.
[time=862] You're really not missing anything.
[time=863] Right now we're just making announcements about junior high and high school activities and regular church functions.
[time=869] We're also taking our regular Sunday morning offering.
[time=872] We record these moments so that we can talk directly to you friends.
[time=877] I want to ask you to help us with a special presentation that we want to put together this fall.
[time=883] It is a video presentation of how God has used his word through the Bible hour in your life.
[time=891] Perhaps you've accepted Christ on a Sunday morning as you've watched the Bible hour.
[time=896] Or maybe you have come to a crossroads in your life and you've made a significant spiritual decision.
[time=902] Maybe God has used this telecast to strengthen you through the loss of a loved one.
[time=907] What is your story?
[time=908] Would you share it with us?
[time=910] Or you don't have to disclose the secrets of your diary but just take time to send us a brief letter or a postcard telling us your story so that we would know how God's using this in your life.
[time=921] We hope that you'll do that.
[time=923] And then as you write, I'd like to send you this little prayer brochure.
[time=928] It's very simple but it's very much to the point.
[time=931] It contains the names of our chief leaders in the government of our great country America.
[time=937] We've listed here the cabinet members who they are and what their positions are.
[time=942] Members of the Supreme Court, our congresswoman Jill Long and our senators Dan Coates and Richard Luger.
[time=948] We'd like to send you this so that you'll pray regularly for our country.
[time=953] The Bible tells us that righteousness exults a nation and that sin is a reproach to any people.
[time=960] God also tells us we are to pray for all men, for kings and for everyone in authority.
[time=966] And so we've put this together during the month of July, a patriotic season to remind each of us to be praying for our country.
[time=975] So as you write to tell us your Bible Hour story, also request our leadership prayer guide.
[time=981] Our address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1006] We do want to encourage you to write. We'd love to hear your story and we would count that as a great privilege to be able to know how Christ has worked in your life.
[time=1015] And we do want you to be a prayer partner with us for our nation.
[time=1020] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, I'd like to invite you to our Wednesday evening services.
[time=1026] Many of you who watch are in the greater Fort Wayne area and we have some exciting things happening on Wednesday nights.
[time=1033] During the month of August, we're offering what we call a practical living seminar.
[time=1038] It's an elective class. You can choose from about ten different seminars where you would like to study.
[time=1045] We have seminars that talk about how do you plan for your student to go to college and select the right college.
[time=1052] We have a seminar on your body, God's Temple, and how can you take better care of your body?
[time=1057] That's talked by a doctor. I'll be teaching a seminar on sex in your marriage.
[time=1062] How our bodies are designed by God and how by obeying Him we can find the greatest joy in life.
[time=1068] We'll have seminars on how to personally manage your money.
[time=1072] We've run on biblical principles for excellence, ten in all on Wednesday nights in August, and we want to include you.
[time=1080] So set your Wednesday nights aside and plan on joining us here at Blackhawk.
[time=1084] We'll be meeting in both the old building and here in the new worship center.
[time=1088] You come and we'll help you find your place.
[time=1091] Finally, I do want to encourage you again to write to us here at the Bible Hour.
[time=1095] Share your story with us and also request this leadership prayer guide.
[time=1099] Our address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1108] As we return to our morning worship service, you'll have the privilege of hearing from Starr Brodigan.
[time=1113] As she sings a great hymn of reverence and of drawing us closer to the Lord,
[time=1119] you'll know the words as you hear her sing in the garden.
[time=1129] [MUSIC] I come to the garden alone [MUSIC] While the dew is still on the roses [MUSIC] And the voice I hear [MUSIC] Falling on my ear [MUSIC] The Son of God [MUSIC] Discourses [MUSIC] And he walks with me [MUSIC] And he talks with me [MUSIC] And he tells me [MUSIC] I am his own [MUSIC] And the joy we share [MUSIC] As we tear with air [MUSIC] None other [MUSIC] Has ever known [MUSIC] He speaks [MUSIC] And the sound of his voice [MUSIC] Is so sweet [MUSIC] The birds hush their singing [MUSIC] And the melody [MUSIC] That he gave to me [MUSIC] Within my heart [MUSIC] Is ringing [MUSIC] And he walks with me [MUSIC] And he talks with me [MUSIC] And he tells me [MUSIC] I am his own [MUSIC] And the joy we share [MUSIC] As we tear with air [MUSIC] None other [MUSIC] Has ever known [MUSIC] It's day in the garden [MUSIC] Within all the light [MUSIC] Around me [MUSIC] Is falling [MUSIC] But he bids me [MUSIC] Go through a voice [MUSIC] Of all [MUSIC] His voice to me [MUSIC] Is calling [MUSIC] And he walks with me [MUSIC] And he talks with me [MUSIC] And he tells me [MUSIC] I am his own [MUSIC] And the joy that we share [MUSIC] As we tear with air [MUSIC] None other [MUSIC] Has ever known ♪
[time=1376] Thank you, Starr, for that great reminder that our Lord does indeed stick with us closer than a brother.
[time=1386] Would you stand with me?
[time=1387] This is the morning when we do our memory verse for the month.
[time=1391] Our verse this month is Hebrews chapter 12, verse two.
[time=1396] If you don't have it memorized yet, that's not a major concern.
[time=1400] It's on the page inside your bulletin.
[time=1402] But if you haven't memorized, recite it with us now.
[time=1405] Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith,
[time=1412] who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning in shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1424] Thank you.
[time=1427] You may be seated.
[time=1431] I appreciate you making that your habit to memorize God's word.
[time=1436] David asked this question, "How shall a young man cleanse his way?" The answer by taking heed according to thy word.
[time=1445] Our lives will have spiritual power, wisdom, and strength for the battle based upon our intake of God's word.
[time=1454] There's no greater habit in life to service us than the memorization of God's word.
[time=1459] I hope you'll make it your habit.
[time=1461] God, we're thankful for your word that it is living, it is alive, it is powerful.
[time=1466] We thank you that it gives strength for our battle.
[time=1469] It gives direction for our journey.
[time=1471] It gives comfort for our moments in the garden.
[time=1475] We worship you today, Lord Jesus.
[time=1478] You are the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[time=1482] You did indeed endure the cross.
[time=1485] And we exalt you and reverent your name and agree that it is above every name.
[time=1492] Our eye cannot see, but our hearts can imagine today.
[time=1496] You, seated at the right hand of the throne of God, and we lift our voices in praise.
[time=1503] We thank you for the promise that you're with us.
[time=1506] We thank you for the comfort of Star Song this morning that there is a quiet side of life
[time=1512] in which you will meet with us.
[time=1515] We do quiet our hearts now, and we ask you to make this our garden experience.
[time=1520] And would you pour out your comfort today upon troubled hearts?
[time=1524] Would you give encouragement to businessmen who are weary in their jobs, who need to be refreshed,
[time=1531] give them their value and their sense of purpose in knowing you renew them?
[time=1537] We pray for women who are discouraged and depression has surrounded them and seems to have an unshakable grip.
[time=1545] You would give them wisdom or counsel or medicine or spiritual direction whatever it takes to release the grip of despair.
[time=1557] We pray today for those whose health is chronically failing,
[time=1563] that even as their bodies grow weaker, their spirits might grow stronger.
[time=1568] We pray for each of our lives that as men and women, we would have an uncompromising commitment to you.
[time=1578] As we study your word today, we ask you to challenge us, make your word real, make it practical, not just for our sake, but for Jesus' sake.
[time=1590] [AMEN] There are several calls the athlete hates to hear.
[time=1599] Fall ball, out of bounds, false start, disqualified.
[time=1609] The Bible tells us that sin is missing the mark, failing to touch God's bases.
[time=1618] When the New York Giants were fighting years ago for the National League pennant, a man by the name of Fred Markle went to bat in the last inning with two outs.
[time=1630] Markle swung his bat with power and he knocked the ball clean over the fence.
[time=1635] It was a homerun. It was the Giants' victory.
[time=1638] And as he made his triumphant trot around the bases, he missed second base.
[time=1643] Went on to third, touched home, was called out, the run was nullified, the game was lost, and the pennant left New York.
[time=1654] If athletics teaches us anything, it teaches us that we must compete according to the rules.
[time=1662] In Hebrews 12, 1 and 2, God likens our serving him to the race of an athlete.
[time=1672] And the athlete becomes an analogy or a metaphor as to how we're to live our life for Christ.
[time=1679] The central instruction of Hebrews 12, 1 and 2 is this.
[time=1683] Let us run the race that is marked out before us.
[time=1687] That race we defined last week is out of undivided service to Christ.
[time=1695] To follow him wholly and fully and primarily is your calling and mine.
[time=1703] Last week we examined how God would want us to run.
[time=1706] We are to run remembering we are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=1710] You may not care whether you come in second, third or fourth.
[time=1714] You may not care whether you win or lose.
[time=1717] This one may not care whether they get disqualified or not.
[time=1721] But as soon as you become a part of a relay team, what you do not only determines your future and your outcome,
[time=1728] but it determines the outcome for the entire team.
[time=1732] For if three other men have run before you and you now carry the baton, if you disqualify yourself, you disqualify them.
[time=1741] If you quit, you quit for them.
[time=1744] If you fail, you do not just fail for yourself, but you fail for the entire team.
[time=1750] Now God's baton is placed into my hand and into yours.
[time=1755] And we are to run remembering we are a part of his eternal relay team.
[time=1761] But there's a second principle that gives direction to our study today.
[time=1765] It is this one.
[time=1766] It's found at the end, really in the middle of verse one.
[time=1770] It says let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with endurance,
[time=1780] the race that has marked out for us.
[time=1784] Today we are instructed that we are to run releasing anything that holds us back and he names two things.
[time=1793] One is he says release anything that hinders and secondly release the sin that entangles us.
[time=1803] Let's look at those things one at a time.
[time=1805] First he says release anything that hinders us.
[time=1810] Y.A. Tittle was one of the great quarterbacks of all times.
[time=1815] He tells the story on himself as a young athlete before he broke into the ranks of the prose.
[time=1820] He didn't usually carry the ball but he picked up the ball and he ran a bootleg around the end.
[time=1825] And it completely faked out the defensive team and he was breaking down the sidelines almost unnoticed by himself.
[time=1833] When along the way the belt to his pants gave way.
[time=1838] Tittle says he ran with the ball in this arm holding his pants up with the other arm
[time=1844] and it slowed him down to the point where he was running only in his hip pad girdles with his pants down around his knees
[time=1850] shuffling along and finally the defense woke up and tackled him on about the 12 yard line.
[time=1857] I am so thankful that I never had one of those experiences in my athletic career.
[time=1864] I'm sure you feel the same way.
[time=1867] But the Bible says there are things that can get caught up around our ankles that can entangle us like a failing belt and sagging pants
[time=1876] that can break our stride, keep us from moving forward and allow us to be caught short of our goal.
[time=1884] Two things can do that to you and to me.
[time=1888] One is anything that hinders describing something other than that which is sinful, secondly sin itself.
[time=1898] The King James says this anything is hinders is a weight.
[time=1903] Before we even dig into what that weight can be, I think we need to define that whatever it is,
[time=1909] it's not something that's sinful because he's going to allude to that secondly.
[time=1914] The weight is something that in and of itself may be good.
[time=1917] It may be fine, but it keeps you from giving your best to God.
[time=1925] It holds you back from complete allegiance and service to Christ.
[time=1930] A wonderful scholar by the name of Kenneth we said that this word that hinders or the weight of King James is this.
[time=1938] It is a weight, bulk, or mass. Hence, swelling, superfluity, a flesh.
[time=1944] How's that for a mouthful? Swelling, superfluity, a flesh.
[time=1949] He says it is an illusion therefore to the training period preparatory to erase when the athlete reduces the abundance of flesh.
[time=1960] Well, if you didn't understand it, let me put it this way.
[time=1963] You'll never meet a marathon runner named Bubba.
[time=1968] You may meet a defensive lineman named Bubba, but never a marathon runner.
[time=1973] You'll never meet a long distance swimmer whose nickname is the refrigerator.
[time=1978] It won't happen.
[time=1981] In some athletic events, size and bulk and mass counts, running is not one of those.
[time=1988] And here the Bible is saying that as a runner, they put off anything that hinders them from running the fastest.
[time=1999] You don't have to have a great athletic imagination to realize that you'll never see a sprinter in ski boots.
[time=2007] You'll never see a swimmer swimming in his warm up.
[time=2010] You'll never see a long distance runner carrying his training barbells.
[time=2015] There comes a time when you enter the race that you drop anything and everything that holds you back.
[time=2023] William Barclay put it simply this way.
[time=2026] If we would travel far, we must travel light.
[time=2032] In our spiritual lives, it's our responsibility to give up, to cast off, to shed anything that's good, that's valuable,
[time=2043] that's approved of if it keeps us from fully following Christ.
[time=2053] FB Myra, Bible writer, commentator of a year ago, said every believer must be left to decide what is his own special weight.
[time=2063] We may not judge for another.
[time=2065] What is right for one is not so for all.
[time=2069] The wrong for this one is not necessarily prohibited for the others.
[time=2074] There's a great temptation when we hear a message that challenges us to shed a weight to use our elbow to nudge the person next to us and miss the personal application.
[time=2088] Your weight may be golf, but I'm not here to say there's anything wrong with golf.
[time=2095] I hope to tee it up next Saturday morning.
[time=2098] Your weight may be music.
[time=2100] Your weight may be entertainment.
[time=2102] Your weight may be your work that you give yourself too exclusively to the job.
[time=2108] Your weight may be your personal pursuit of success and fame.
[time=2112] Your weight may be the pursuit of financial gain.
[time=2117] Your weight may be church.
[time=2120] Yeah, this church.
[time=2123] Maybe we've offered too many programs and you've got too many jobs and too many days of your life that you come to this place and you've gotten addicted not to Christianity, but to Churchianity.
[time=2137] This passage is saying that we are to follow and to serve Christ and we are to give up anything and everything that holds us back.
[time=2145] Jesus said, "What does it profit a man if he gains the entire world and yet loses his own soul?"
[time=2152] Allow me to paraphrase it.
[time=2155] What does it profit if you as a salesman sell more houses than anybody else, but you lead no one to an eternal home?
[time=2166] Or what value is it if you can sing like a virtue or so, but you've not tuned your own heart to sing his praises?
[time=2177] What does it profit if you've built an insurance empire, but you've led no one to the assurance of Christ?
[time=2185] What does it matter that we built this sanctuary?
[time=2188] It's large, it's spacious, it's beautiful, it's functional.
[time=2193] If we don't live in sanctification inside its walls, what do we accomplish in life's rat race if we aren't running his real race?
[time=2206] What's your weight?
[time=2211] What hinders you?
[time=2214] What's falling down around your ankles that causes you to break your spiritual stride?
[time=2222] Maybe you are weak at this point and this person doesn't have the slightest problem.
[time=2228] We can't judge the next person, the Bible tells us, judge ourselves, and we won't need to be judged.
[time=2236] And we must lay off, put aside anything that hinders us.
[time=2242] I've told you this story before, but I like it so endure it again, please.
[time=2247] In 1969, the Big Ten Freshmen Championships were held at that school north of us in Ann Arbor.
[time=2256] And at that time, there was a swimmer by the name of Mark Spitz, who swam for that other school located down south of us in Bloomington.
[time=2266] A young man from my high school named Bill Katz swam for that third school in Columbus, Ohio.
[time=2272] Mark Spitz was basically unbeatable. He was the best in the world.
[time=2278] This event was the 50-yard freestyle. Down and back, all six of them are going to make it in under 21 seconds.
[time=2287] It's going to be fast and it's going to be furious.
[time=2290] As a matter of fact, when the race was over, all six teams jumped up and said, "Our guy won."
[time=2296] The only way you could tell was there were electronic plates that when the swimmer touched it, they stopped the clock.
[time=2302] While everybody was yelling, our team won, they also looked to check the scoreboard.
[time=2308] And on that day, Bill Katz from Cowgo Falls High School beat Mark Spitz by three-one-thousandths of a second.
[time=2320] And the difference was this.
[time=2323] For Mark Spitz, it was another race, and he approached it like another race.
[time=2329] For Bill Katz, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
[time=2334] And he approached it like it was the race of his life, and it was.
[time=2338] And you see, swimmers do some strange things. One of the things they do before their biggest meat is they shave down.
[time=2346] Watching the Olympics, you would think that a requirement to be a male swimmer is that you be bald.
[time=2350] They're not bald. They shave their hands, their chest, their arms, their legs.
[time=2358] Because that hair holds a little bit of water, and it makes the difference.
[time=2366] Bill Katz shaved down. Mark Spitz did not.
[time=2371] Bill Katz won. Spitz lost, because one cast off anything that would hold him back.
[time=2381] A lot of times we have something in our hand that's good.
[time=2385] It's not sinful. It just keeps us from following God fully.
[time=2390] God said, "Moses, I want you to follow me." Moses had a staff. That staff represented his career as a shepherd, as a herdsman.
[time=2401] It was not only his staff, but the scepter of his work, and God said, "Throw it down, Moses.
[time=2408] Leave it behind. Follow me." Peter was a fisherman.
[time=2415] He mended nets, and he knew how to cast them, and he knew how to drag them and pull in the great load.
[time=2423] Jesus said, "What's that in your hand, Peter?" A net, drop it, and follow me.
[time=2434] A young man, a leader, a ruler, a wealthy man came to Jesus and wanted to follow him, and Jesus had fined.
[time=2443] Take all that you have, your money, your goods, your possessions, sell them off, give them to the poor, and then come and follow me.
[time=2456] Jesus only told the rich young ruler to give up his money.
[time=2461] He only told Peter to give up his fishing, and he only told Moses to give up his shepherding.
[time=2466] He doesn't tell everyone of us to give up our money, he doesn't tell all of us to give up our fishing, but he tells each of us to give up that one thing in our life that keeps us from following him fully and wholly.
[time=2482] It doesn't mean you can't fish, it doesn't mean you can't have money, it doesn't mean that you can't be a farmer or a shepherd.
[time=2489] It does mean that if any of those things keep you from serving Christ and the best, even though they're good, they've got to go.
[time=2498] Secondly, in this passage, he shifts from weight, that which is good, to sin, that which is obviously wrong and evil.
[time=2511] In this passage it says, "Let us give up the sin."
[time=2518] The little word "the," the definite article is there.
[time=2522] And so scholars who study the Bible raised this question, "What is the sin to which this book is referring?"
[time=2530] Some and I respect them saying, "Well, the sin that's being referred to here is the sin of defection."
[time=2537] Because that's the theme of Hebrews. These people had come to Christ, they had entered the race, they had gotten off to a good start,
[time=2545] and now they were pulling up lame, they were quitting, they were dropping out, they were stepping into the infield and letting the rest run by.
[time=2554] And some feel that the sin here is defection, leaving the race.
[time=2559] Well, to be sure that can be an interpretation and really does fit the passage.
[time=2565] I personally think he says "the sin" rather than naming "a" sin because each of us have our own Achilles heel.
[time=2574] For God to list all of the potential sins would have been an unending task.
[time=2581] He trusts you to be honest with yourself, and he gives you his Holy Spirit to aid you so that you'll know what sins are in your life.
[time=2590] He doesn't have to list them one by one.
[time=2595] Just like the runner must cast off the weight, he also must cast off any sin.
[time=2602] Because you see, if you run well, if you run light, and if you win, but you fail to compete according to the rules, you lose.
[time=2616] You see, sin disqualifies us from the race.
[time=2622] Few years ago, we'd never heard the term. Now it is the chief concern of athletics andabolic steroids.
[time=2631] On a Saturday, eight runners in Seoul, Korea, lined up on the starting line.
[time=2637] They methodically placed their thumbs and fingers and hands down as close to the starting line as they could.
[time=2644] They dug their spikes in, they braced against the starting blocks, and when the sound went off, they dashed out in the 100-meter race.
[time=2656] Ben Johnson exploded out of his starting blocks. He was ahead from the time the gun went off, the race was never in question.
[time=2666] He was so far ahead of Carl Lewis that Ben Johnson could look over, put up a hand of victory and smile at Lewis as he blew by him.
[time=2676] Ben Johnson set a world's record, 9.79, shaving his own world record by a full second, beating Carl Lewis by more than a tenth of a second.
[time=2692] They hoisted up the Canadian flag and they sang the Canadian National Anthem.
[time=2698] It was a glorious Saturday for Ben Johnson. On Monday, they took his medal back.
[time=2705] They erased his name and his time from the record book, and he went home, hiding behind a newspaper in a briefcase, as the press tried to take his picture.
[time=2718] He competed. He competed well. He had run like no other man had ran in history, but he didn't do it according to the rules, and he was disqualified.
[time=2733] This passage is reminding us that if we were to run for Jesus Christ, we've got to make sure that we run in a way that will never be disqualified.
[time=2743] We here believe in a doctrine if you like a theological term called eternal security.
[time=2749] What that means is if you truly come to Christ and receive him in your heart as Savior, he will never leave you, and you have a home in heaven, yes, even if you sin.
[time=2761] If you choose to receive Christ and you sin and you live in sin and you renounce Christ, we ask the question, did you ever really come to Christ in the first place?
[time=2773] But what this passage is telling us, if you're a believer in Christ and you're running for him and you sin, he won't reject you.
[time=2782] He won't kick you off the team, but he will disqualify you.
[time=2788] I remember taking Latin in the tenth grade. The teacher kept saying in a gruff voice, "Latin is not a dead language. Latin is not a dead language."
[time=2798] I realized at the end of the first nine weeks, Latin wasn't a dead language. He was the guy that was dead.
[time=2804] Then we got the report cards. I was the guy that was dead.
[time=2809] Both my father and my swim coach reminded me that students with F grades did not swim on the team and that I was ineligible.
[time=2823] God doesn't throw you off his team if you sin, but he does mark you as ineligible, and he does take your race that you've already run and mark you as a disqualified.
[time=2837] You see, his believers in Jesus Christ, this is our expectation of living for him, of dying, of waking up, breathing new air, finding its celestial,
[time=2852] touching a hand and finding it God's. And hearing his voice say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."
[time=2867] If we sin, we still are welcome to heaven, but we never hear his voice articulate, "Well done. Well done, thou good and faithful servant."
[time=2883] We're disqualified from that reward. We are also disqualified from ministry and opportunities of service today.
[time=2895] You see, once you choose to sin, and the men at the office see that they cross you off as a credible witness for Christ, and whatever you have to say about Christ, they can discount it and ignore it.
[time=2909] When you choose a path of sin and your neighbors are aware of it, that this minishes your ministry, it is over.
[time=2918] The Apostle Paul said in this vein that he controlled his body, that he literally beat his body, that he brought it in the subjection, that he disciplined his life so that after he had preached to others, he himself would not be disqualified.
[time=2936] The Bible brings us to the reality of the athlete. We must compete according to God's rules. We must touch second base, or the home run doesn't count.
[time=2951] Here sin is described as the sin that so easily entangles us. The path of sin is an easy path. Jesus is the one who said, "Broad is the gate, and wide is the way that leads to destruction, but narrow is the gate, and hard is the path that leads to eternal life."
[time=2978] The first thing that you and I need to know about sin is this, it is easy. In life, you and I will constantly be faced with choices. One of the choices will be to sin, and the other choice will be to obey God, the obedience will be the hard choice, and sin will be the easiest choice.
[time=3002] Sin is in us as well as around us, and we have a heart and a spirit and a nature that has already inclined to sin. Then we have a world that allures us and baits us and says, "Come on along, it's easy, you'll like it."
[time=3024] And just as sin is easy, righteousness and obedience to Christ is hard. It is difficult, it is costly.
[time=3034] I don't know if you're like me, but middle age has some tough battles that I don't like. When I was 22, I could eat everything on the table and then half of the table and not gain weight.
[time=3049] Now I look at the table and I gain a pound. A friend and I made a commitment that we're going to hold each other accountable to weigh 151 pounds or less.
[time=3061] I haven't seen 151 since the day before Thanksgiving last year, and the easiest thing for me to do is to eat.
[time=3073] The hardest thing for me to do is to exercise. I don't know how many times this summer I've gone down to the neighborhood pool and they've got a lane right there exclusively for those who want to swim laps.
[time=3085] I've gone down to the neighborhood pool and I looked up and I was hot. It was human. Guy my age shouldn't work out on a day like this and I went home.
[time=3096] Yesterday I went down to the pool. It wasn't all that hot. Stuck my foot in the water. It was kind of cold. Guy my age shouldn't dive into water that cold.
[time=3108] You laugh because I'm talking about you as much as me. But the easiest thing to do is to eat something. The hardest thing to do is to say no and to exercise.
[time=3119] And that's the very nature of sin. The easiest thing to do is to turn your back on God.
[time=3128] And the hardest thing to do is to follow Him. The athlete knows that. So does the middle age dieter.
[time=3137] This passage reminds us that sin is easy. Secondly, this passage tells us that sin is entangling.
[time=3146] James chapter one gives us this insight into the methodology of how sin entangles us.
[time=3152] It says let no one say when he is tempted. God tempted me for God cannot be tempted with evil neither does he tempt any man.
[time=3164] But each man is tempted when he is drawn out by his own lust and enticed.
[time=3172] One Bible commentator says there are two good fishing terms there. A fisherman I'm not. I'll borrow from this writer.
[time=3180] He says the word drawn out is the word to lure. Like a fisherman who cast his line into the water and attaches to it a lure.
[time=3189] Something that catches the fish's attention. Maybe it glistens. Maybe it sparkles.
[time=3196] But we are lured away from spiritual obedience because something attracts us. Something catches our attention.
[time=3206] And then we are enticed. Having been lured over to the hook we then notice this round thick juicy succulent night crawler.
[time=3220] And the fish begins to nibble at it. He says I like this. And then he strikes it.
[time=3228] And he is hooked. He is entangled. He is caught.
[time=3234] The Bible here tells us that sin works that way. It is attractive. It is alluring.
[time=3241] Don't think for a moment that the Bible says you don't want to sin. It is always bad. It is always ugly.
[time=3250] The Bible says sin is a pleasure. But for a season. And it will always allure us. It will always be attractive.
[time=3259] And it will always bait us and we will become hooked. Sin can entangle us.
[time=3268] Years ago here is how those who wanted to capture monkeys set their trap.
[time=3274] They would take a jar with a very small neck. Small enough that the monkey would have to work but not too hard to get his hand inside it.
[time=3283] And they would put candy. Real. Good. Sweet. Candy. In the jar.
[time=3289] They would tie the bottle down so it couldn't be moved. And then outside the jar they would drop a piece of candy.
[time=3297] Few feet later another piece of candy. Few feet later another piece of candy and then they would back off.
[time=3303] Along comes the monkey. He discovers this new commodity and he picks it up and he smells it.
[time=3309] And he nibbles at it and he tastes it. It is good. He eats it. Walks along and there is another piece.
[time=3317] And this is great. Manna from heaven. And he eats that and he just follows the trail.
[time=3322] And then he's already got the smell. He's already got the taste. He finds that jar and he knows what's in there.
[time=3328] And he works his hand right in there and he gets a big handful.
[time=3332] And out comes the would be captor with a net. The monkey sees him and he pulls. And he pulls.
[time=3339] And he can't get his fist in a hand out. And he's in a dilemma.
[time=3345] He either has to drop the candy and run or hold onto it and be captured.
[time=3352] And his appetite is so great that he won't let go of the candy and he's captured.
[time=3360] So sin works in your life and mine. A little is dropped in front of us. A little is dropped in front of us and we become addicted to our sins.
[time=3371] And then we have a choice. We can repent and turn away or we can hang on to it and end up totally destroyed by our sin.
[time=3384] Two things can keep us from running this race.
[time=3390] Any weight, something that's good but it keeps you from the best and sin which easily entangles and traps us.
[time=3400] What are we to do? It says this. Let us throw off everything that hinders.
[time=3410] Whatever it is, you've got to drop it. You've got to throw it down. You've got to discard it.
[time=3417] This word throw off is used in one other place. It's in Acts chapter 7. A hostile crowd is gathered around Stephen.
[time=3425] And they are tired of him telling him about Christ. Here's what it says in Acts chapter 8 verse 57.
[time=3432] At Stephen's words, they covered their ears. Yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him.
[time=3438] They dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
[time=3447] These men had captured Stephen. They had surrounded him. They began to stone him and they realized they couldn't throw as well with their coats on.
[time=3455] So they took him off and they threw him down at Saul's feet because they wanted to throw him. They wanted to destroy this one.
[time=3461] They wanted to kill him. And they were going to throw off anything that kept them from their task.
[time=3468] What's keeping you from your task of serving Christ? Whatever it is, throw it off now.
[time=3491] If today you're not running for Christ, if you haven't turned over your life to him, I want to invite you to pray with me now
[time=3520] and ask Christ to come into your heart and be your Lord and Savior. I suggest a prayer like this.
[time=3527] Lord Jesus, I know that I've lived my life for myself, that I've sinned and missed the mark.
[time=3535] I believe you are God and that you died for my sins. I ask you to come into my heart to be my Lord and Savior. Amen.
[time=3546] If you made that spiritual commitment to Christ today, I want to encourage you to write for us and request the booklet, "Lessons on Assurance."
