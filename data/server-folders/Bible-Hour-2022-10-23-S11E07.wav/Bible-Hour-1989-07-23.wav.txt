[time=0] (mysterious music)
[time=90] - In the 1984 Olympics, the most spectacular race was run by a young swiss gal by the name of Gabriella.
[time=117] She didn't place gold, silver, nor bronze.
[time=121] In fact, in the woman's marathon, she finished a full 15 minutes behind the leader.
[time=127] But hers was indeed a spectacular race.
[time=130] The marathon had taken its toll on her body, but her spirit was strong.
[time=135] And as she entered the Coliseum for her final lap, she literally stumbled and fell.
[time=141] Rose and staggered again, weaved and bobbed her way and collapsed across the finish line.
[time=149] hers was a great victory, not for its speed or its time, but because she refused to quit.
[time=158] I don't know what battles you're facing in life, but God's word gives us this challenge.
[time=163] It's too soon to quit.
[time=166] (mysterious music)
[time=179] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=183] Thank you for joining us.
[time=185] Rick's message today is entitled, "Reviews to Quit." Like the athlete in a marathon, Christians must run with endurance.
[time=192] The life of following Christ is not a sprint, but a lifelong marathon.
[time=197] The fatigue of persecution, criticism, suffering, and difficulties wear on each of us.
[time=203] But God's word encourages us to keep running.
[time=205] It is too soon to quit.
[time=208] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=211] Rick's text is taken from the book of Hebrews, chapter 12, verses 1 through 3.
[time=217] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=222] Other special music includes a solo from Kathy Hawks and Tim Teder.
[time=230] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=238] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=245] Now, here's Rick.
[time=247] We're just glad that you're here today.
[time=249] If you're a regular attender or a visitor, we want you to feel welcome.
[time=253] If you're joining us by way of television, we hope that God uses this hour to speak to your heart.
[time=258] We come today out of God's goodness and His grace.
[time=261] It's because of His grace that we can have forgiveness, that we can have new life,
[time=267] and that is the theme to which our choir directs our attention.
[time=275] [MUSIC] We hear as Lord praise [MUSIC] When the burden grows greater [MUSIC] He said that voice pray [MUSIC] When the light burns in priest [MUSIC] To add in the vision [MUSIC] He has His mercy [MUSIC] To golden light's cry [MUSIC] O'er He is vaulted by peace [MUSIC] He is vaulted over it [MUSIC] His grace has no measure [MUSIC] His power has no longer enough to bear [MUSIC] O'er out of his infinite bridges [MUSIC] In Jesus [MUSIC] He give birth [MUSIC] And give birth [MUSIC] And give birth for care [MUSIC] And we have exhaust [MUSIC] So come in to rest [MUSIC] With our sickness [MUSIC] With our days and done [MUSIC] When we receive love [MUSIC] Our glory resources [MUSIC] Our fathers for giving [MUSIC] Is only people [MUSIC] His love has no limit [MUSIC] His grace has no measure [MUSIC] His power has no longer enough to bear [MUSIC] O round of his infinite creatures [MUSIC] In chains of us [MUSIC] In heaven and in heaven [MUSIC] And in heaven and in heaven [MUSIC] In heaven and in heaven [MUSIC] On the space of our glory war [MUSIC] Grace that we see, our spirit are near [MUSIC] On the ground of his love, our war [MUSIC] There the world of the land was still [MUSIC] There is grace for our praise [MUSIC] Grace that we are in and we're in [MUSIC] There is grace for our praise [MUSIC] Grace that is greater than all we're seeing [MUSIC] On the sea that rest was raised [MUSIC] Grace that our glory is [MUSIC] You never hurry to see this grace [MUSIC] There is more than this grace we see [MUSIC] Grace, grace for our praise [MUSIC] Grace that we are in and we're seeing [MUSIC] Grace, grace for our praise [MUSIC] Grace that is greater than all we're seeing [MUSIC] Grace, grace, grace, just be the sun [MUSIC] Grace, grace, grace for our praise [MUSIC] Our hearts, our hearts, our hearts [MUSIC] To our love and God [MUSIC] Our hearts, our love and God [MUSIC] Grace, grace for our praise [MUSIC] When I first began to walk with the Lord [MUSIC] I didn't really trust Him [MUSIC] How He longed for me to understand [MUSIC] That I grew [MUSIC] So through the valley [MUSIC] He let me be afraid [MUSIC] As I could be [MUSIC] 'Til I felt His love [MUSIC] In the blessing of me [MUSIC] And I've been through enough to know He'll be young [MUSIC] And be [MUSIC] He's come through so many times [MUSIC] That puts my mind at ease [MUSIC] I'll stick my very life [MUSIC] He's gonna take care of me [MUSIC] 'Cause I've been through enough to know He'll be enough [MUSIC] How could I ever doubt Your God [MUSIC] Who holds the universe [MUSIC] And why would I ever question His [MUSIC] Ability [MUSIC] There's no place that I can go [MUSIC] That He doesn't know [MUSIC] The things that trouble me [MUSIC] He's aware of where I am [MUSIC] And what I need [MUSIC] I believe Him now [MUSIC] After all these years He's so faithful [MUSIC] He's proven to be true [MUSIC] May I never doubt [MUSIC] Or question why [MUSIC] 'Cause I've seen Him work before [MUSIC] And I know what God can do [MUSIC] But I've been through enough to know He'll be enough for me [MUSIC] He's come through so many times [MUSIC] There puts my mind at ease [MUSIC] For good [MUSIC] And I'll stick my very life [MUSIC] He's gonna take care of me [MUSIC] 'Cause I've been through enough to know He'll be enough for me [MUSIC] Yes, I've been through enough to know He'll be enough for me [MUSIC] The Lord is my shepherd [MUSIC] I shall not want [MUSIC] He makes me lie down [MUSIC] And bring pastures [MUSIC] He leads me beside the still waters [MUSIC] He restores it my soul [MUSIC] He guides my path [MUSIC] In righteousness for his name's sake [MUSIC] Surely goodness and loving kindness [MUSIC] Shall follow me all the days of my life [MUSIC] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord [MUSIC] Forever and ever and ever [MUSIC] Though I walk through the valley [MUSIC] Of the shadow of death [MUSIC] I will not fear thou art with me [MUSIC] Thy rod and thy staff [MUSIC] They comfort me [MUSIC] Thou preparest a table [MUSIC] Before me in the presence of my enemy [MUSIC] How anointist my head with oil [MUSIC] My cup's overflowing [MUSIC] Surely goodness and loving kindness [MUSIC] Shall follow me all the days of my life [MUSIC] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord [MUSIC] Forever and ever and ever [MUSIC] The Lord is my shepherd [MUSIC] I shall not want â™ª
[time=1401] - God, our Father, we are thankful that you are our shepherd today.
[time=1406] Thank you for that steadfast word of God.
[time=1410] Thank you for the unique way that Tim could present a timeless truth to us.
[time=1414] Thank you for the beauty of a string guitar and a voice that can penetrate even the busyness of our world and cause us to listen.
[time=1424] And God, we want to hear your voice.
[time=1426] We want you to speak today.
[time=1429] We ask you to take your word and make it not just a tradition, but a transforming power in each hero's life.
[time=1438] We pray that you would speak to the hearts of men who have protected themselves from a spiritual warfare by withdrawing from the battle.
[time=1448] Give to our men a desire to engage on the front lines
[time=1456] and the battles against temptation, sin, and compromise.
[time=1461] We pray for the women of our church that you will give them insight as to how they can live their lives in a way that will be a testimony of the glory of Christ.
[time=1473] Give to our church a hunger for sexual purity and a time when people are living by their appetites.
[time=1482] Give to us a sense of tongue control that we speak the truth and we speak it in love with grace, seasoned like with salt.
[time=1494] Give to us a pursuit of holiness and righteousness, but make it free from hypocrisy and self-exaltation.
[time=1502] We ask you now to examine us.
[time=1507] And as David prayed, we ask you to search us and to try us to know us, to see if there'd be any unclean way and show it to us.
[time=1517] We would pray that your word would give great comfort to those who are walking through hard valleys, for Soutoy Rack and for Dottie Rodenback as their loved ones are so critically ill.
[time=1533] We pray for Diane Stitzer that you would continue to comfort her heart in the death of her father.
[time=1539] We pray for Lee Bixler that he would recover from surgery and for Bonnie Farrell's daughter as she recovers from an accident, may your hands be upon their lives.
[time=1552] And now as we open up your word, give to us insight for living, for our sake, for this church's sake, and for Jesus' sake, amen.
[time=1567] In 490 BC, one of the greatest battles of military history took place on the eastern shore of the Greek peninsula.
[time=1579] The Persian Darius I had launched a fleet of ships with 20,000 soldiers on board to attack Greece, to subdue the country, and to begin at Athens.
[time=1591] It is fleet landed about 25 miles north of the city.
[time=1597] His 20,000 soldiers, pitched camp, took rest and prepared for their march south.
[time=1604] 10,000 Greeks, only half of the number marched north under Meltietes to stop the Persians.
[time=1612] The Greeks were outnumbered, two to one.
[time=1616] That night, Meltietes wrestled with a decision.
[time=1621] Knowing that he was outnumbered, he decided not to wait for their attack, but to attack them, and his attack was a success.
[time=1629] He surprised and routed the Persian army, and his 10,000 drove their 20,000 right back into the Aegean Sea.
[time=1637] Only 192 Greek lives were lost.
[time=1644] The Persians took to their ships and began to sail to Athens, hoping to catch the city unguarded.
[time=1652] Meltietes, again, challenged his men to march all night to defend the city, but the ships could arrive early.
[time=1661] What if the people of Athens lost hope?
[time=1663] What if they surrendered before Meltietes could return?
[time=1667] He went to a soldier, a young man, by the name of Phildipides, and Phildipides was given the responsibility of shedding his armor, dropping his shield and sword, and running from the point of that battle, the Straits of Marathon, to Athens.
[time=1689] Phildipides began his run of approximately 26 miles.
[time=1695] He never stopped for food or for water, for shade or for rest.
[time=1700] Phildipides ran into the city, went through the gates, through the busy streets, up onto the high point, they're cropless, and there in the Agora, he took the position of the spokesman and he shouted out one word, Nike, victory, and he dropped dead.
[time=1718] Out of that lesson of history comes the responsibility
[time=1725] as a believer in Christ to run for Jesus until we die.
[time=1730] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it to Hebrews chapter 12, as we study verses one through three.
[time=1738] We've been looking at these verses the past two Sundays and we'll pitch our camp there today and next Sunday for the last time.
[time=1748] In Hebrews chapter 12, verses one through three, the Christian life is drawn by comparison to that of an athletic race, it reads.
[time=1763] Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance, the race marked out for us.
[time=1782] Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1798] Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men
[time=1804] so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=1809] By way of review, we're drawing out of this analogy, this extended metaphor for principles out of athletics that are transferable to our Christian life.
[time=1822] That's why God had the author of Hebrews use the analogy of a race.
[time=1827] The first principle was this, we are to remember that we are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=1834] God has always had a people, someone who would run for him, someone who would carry the baton.
[time=1843] In US history, there was a great spokesman for God by the name of D.L. Moody.
[time=1848] And it wasn't long after Moody, the great evangelism went out of the picture that God raised up a Billy Sunday.
[time=1855] And after Billy Sunday had an illustrative career as a spokesman for Christ, God raised up a Billy Graham.
[time=1863] But just as God has always had some of those prominent people, He has always had people who were faithful, not in the spotlight, not behind the pulpits, not under the theater lights, but in the businesses, in the offices, in the street corners, in the cul-de-sacs, in the swimming pools at the golf courses, and the points of work and recreation who were faithful to him.
[time=1890] And throughout the ages, God has had a people, and you and I now are running the relay that they started.
[time=1900] If we win, we do not just win for ourselves, but for them.
[time=1906] And if we lose, we do not lose just for ourselves, but we lose for them.
[time=1913] So we are to run, remembering we are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=1918] That's what it means when it says, consider that we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses.
[time=1924] Those witnesses are the people identified in God's Hall of Fame, Hebrews 11.
[time=1929] Now we carry the baton.
[time=1931] The second principle we looked at last week is that we are to release anything that holds us back.
[time=1939] Anything that is sinful is gonna be discarded now.
[time=1944] And anything that's good, that's appropriate, but it keeps us from giving God our best.
[time=1952] It too must be discarded.
[time=1953] It too must be cast off.
[time=1956] Like the marathon runner who strips down to the bare necessities wants nothing that holds him back.
[time=1966] The third principle we come to today in a phrase is this, refuse to quit.
[time=1974] It's found in this statement at the end of verse one.
[time=1980] And let us run with perseverance, the race that is marked out for us.
[time=1989] The race that is marked out for us is to follow Jesus Christ, to live a life that is so godly, that is so praiseworthy, that is so winsome, that is so free from pretentious piety, that is devoid of hypocrisy and self-righteousness, that just follows Jesus, that people get the two of us confused.
[time=2013] I had an embarrassing moment this last hour.
[time=2018] A couple in their sixties came up and introduced themselves to me and said, hi, I'm your cousin.
[time=2026] I said, you are, have we ever met before?
[time=2030] Oh sure, they said, if we're not really your cousin, we're your dad's cousin.
[time=2034] Now my dad has over 51st cousins, so it's easy to get lost in the shuffle.
[time=2040] And they said to me, we remember you, oh no.
[time=2044] We remember you at Grandpa Rob's house running around when you were this big, and as soon as we saw you, we knew who you were because you look just like your dad.
[time=2056] Wouldn't it be great if somebody came up to you and they said, we know you the first time we saw you because you act just like our Heavenly Father.
[time=2070] That's the race that's marked out for us, that we live for Jesus so fully, so completely, that when somebody wants to know what a person is, they say, well, it's like that guy, or it's like her.
[time=2085] That's our race that's marked out before us.
[time=2089] And we are to refuse to quit in this race.
[time=2094] Three simple points, point number one is this.
[time=2097] Our race is to be run.
[time=2099] Many of us don't know what the race is, that we have signed up for.
[time=2106] In the language of the New Testament, Greek, there are a couple of different words for the word race.
[time=2113] Several could have been chosen.
[time=2115] The one that God shows is a word that is pronounced, agon.
[time=2120] It is the word from which we get our word, agony.
[time=2125] Many athletic events require brute strength and a burst of speed.
[time=2132] For example, the 100 meter dash is well under 10 seconds.
[time=2137] It's an explosion out of the blocks, a burst of energy, and in 10 seconds, it's over.
[time=2144] Nothing but dust to settle.
[time=2146] The 50 meter freestyle is just barely over 20 seconds.
[time=2151] One trip down a long pool.
[time=2155] In weightlifting, with brute strength, they grab the bar, and with an explosion of energy, they bring it to a clean, and then a jerk, and they just have to hold it locked for one full count, and they drop it, and the contest is over.
[time=2175] I don't know about you, but my natural tendency is for that kind of athletics.
[time=2181] I like the short ones, the burst of speed, and it's done.
[time=2185] When I was in high school, I swam the 25 free, or excuse me, the 50 free, and the only reason why I swam the 50 free is they didn't have a 25 free.
[time=2195] The shorter the better, and in our lives, most of us are willing to have a burst of speed for God.
[time=2204] We're willing to live for Christ today.
[time=2206] We're willing to sacrifice some time today.
[time=2208] We're willing to perhaps donate something financially today, but God says, I want the title to your life forever.
[time=2216] I want you to run for me today, and tonight, and tomorrow, and tomorrow night, and I want you to run for me every day of your life, and I want you to never quit.
[time=2228] And the word here is agonini.
[time=2232] This is a race that is to be run,
[time=2238] not a race that is to be observed.
[time=2241] In Christianity, we've produced a whole generation of spectators.
[time=2245] We've reduced Christianity to a spectator sport.
[time=2249] There was a man by the name of Bud Wilkinson, who said, looking at a football game, he saw all the stands were full, and he said at the end of the game, there were 22 men on the field desperately needing rest, and 22,000 men in the stands desperately needing exercise.
[time=2266] And how true that is of the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2271] So few of us are engaged in the battle.
[time=2274] So few of us are running the race, and most of us are watchers.
[time=2279] We're not runners, we're spectators, not participants.
[time=2284] When the writer uses the word agon, he no doubt has that 500-year-old tradition of running the marathon.
[time=2294] He no doubt has in mind that supreme athletic event of his day.
[time=2304] He has in mind the person who ran by the name of Phildipides until he died.
[time=2312] This runs contrary to most of our orientation.
[time=2316] Because of the prosperity of our day, and because of the popular theology of our hour, we do not like the think of the Christian life as an agon knee.
[time=2331] We live in great prosperity, few, if any, at the most a handful of us are really wondering if we'll be able to afford to feed our children today.
[time=2342] There may be some, and I don't want to be insensitive.
[time=2345] But the majority of us are like the lady whose husband said, what's for dinner, she said wrong question, it's where's for dinner.
[time=2353] We live in a fluence, we live in prosperity, and to think that God would call us to agony, doesn't compute in the American thought processes.
[time=2364] And it particularly doesn't jive with what most of us here by way of teaching.
[time=2372] Particularly if we get our teaching from the tube.
[time=2375] There we will hear that it is God's will, that everyone have good health and great wealth.
[time=2384] And if your health is not great today, then you're out of God's will.
[time=2388] If you're not overflowing with wealth, that's because you didn't send enough money to the local whoever is trying to raise it.
[time=2395] And if you'll just send in the money, then God's obligated to multiply it back because it's his will for everybody to be wealthy.
[time=2403] Can I just speak bluntly, not true, not true at all?
[time=2409] Allow me to bring three verses to your attention that I hope will shape your thinking.
[time=2416] The first is John 1633, where Jesus said, in this life you will have tribulation.
[time=2424] In this life you will have hard times to borrow Jim's title.
[time=2431] In this life, bad things will happen to God's people.
[time=2436] James chapter one, verse two says this.
[time=2447] Consider pure joy, my brothers.
[time=2451] When you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
[time=2459] Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
[time=2468] God says not only should we expect them, but we should welcome them because they are a part of God's divine plan that he uses the hard times to bring out the best in us.
[time=2483] They're normative, they're to be expected, and they are to be received strangely, as this sounds, with joy.
[time=2493] A final verse to frame our theology of the moment.
[time=2498] First Peter chapter four, verse 12 says this.
[time=2502] Dear friends, to not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering as though something strange were happening to you, but rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
[time=2519] If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed for the spirit of glory of God rests on you.
[time=2529] The Bible tells us that trials, problems, suffering are to not only be expected, but to be welcomed.
[time=2541] And when they hit our lives, we shouldn't say, "Why'd this happen to me?" They're part of God's plan.
[time=2550] They're part of his process to refine us,
[time=2556] to make out of our lives that which Bill Gather said would be something beautiful and something good.
[time=2563] A pearl that priceless commodity is formed when the oyster closes and secures himself in the shell, but one grain of sand or something of equal irritating influence has intruded.
[time=2581] The oyster then secretes a fluid to coat the rough edges of that grain of sand and continues secreting it until it becomes smooth and round.
[time=2595] The secretion hardens and it grows into a beautiful pearl.
[time=2600] God says, "I put the irritations into your life
[time=2606] "as the process of making a precious jewel out of you." But most of us don't want the hardship.
[time=2616] We've observed then perhaps serving Christ is indeed an agony and we would rather watch as run.
[time=2624] For that reason, some have never joined this church or any church because they didn't want to have to be committed.
[time=2631] They didn't want to have to run.
[time=2633] Others have never told anybody else about Jesus Christ because their life may not measure up to what it ought to be and they didn't want to have to be committed.
[time=2642] They did not want to have to run.
[time=2646] Others have never made a financial commitment to a ministry, to a church, to a missionary, to an outreach program because they didn't want to have to be committed.
[time=2657] They didn't want to have to run.
[time=2659] They knew that it was an agony.
[time=2661] And God says, "This is a race and it is to be run." Secondly, this passage tells us the race is not only to be run, the race is to be done.
[time=2672] It is to be run until it is completed.
[time=2675] It is to be run until we are finished.
[time=2680] In the 1984 Olympics, one runner captured the imagination
[time=2687] of all of us.
[time=2688] There was a Swiss gal by the name of Gabriella.
[time=2691] She competed in the 100, excuse me, the marathon.
[time=2697] And in the marathon, the entire Colosseum in Los Angeles
[time=2703] was filled with spectators who rose to their feet as she approached the final lap and cheered her on.
[time=2710] She did not place.
[time=2714] Her national anthem was not played.
[time=2716] No medal was hung about her neck.
[time=2719] They cheered for her even though she entered the Colosseum 15 minutes after the winner had already crossed the finish line.
[time=2727] They cheered for her because she was exhausted.
[time=2731] And on her final lap in the Colosseum, she collapsed, but regained her balance and went on.
[time=2739] And she staggered and fell again, but she picked herself up.
[time=2743] She purposely avoided those who were coming under the field to help her.
[time=2748] She staggered.
[time=2750] She looked almost intoxicated as she teetered back and forth and collapsed unconscious across the finish line.
[time=2761] And a world applauded her, not because of how fast she ran, but because she finished the race.
[time=2768] We are called to finish this race.
[time=2772] It says, let us run with endurance.
[time=2777] Let us run with perseverance.
[time=2780] That word perseverance, the word of the New Testament means under-distay.
[time=2786] Joe Stoy illustrates it this way.
[time=2789] He said, family picnics, his favorite thing to do is to get the slimy, slurpy watermelon seeds and put them right between his fingers and squeeze them until they pop out.
[time=2800] You've done that.
[time=2803] Don't give a condescending look of superiority like you'd never do such a thing.
[time=2808] And he said as he did that one time, he thought about, that's what God does to us.
[time=2813] He puts us in his hand and then he brings the hard things in life down on us and he's squeezing us between his thumb and his first finger.
[time=2822] And he says, trust me, I'll not squeeze you harder than you can take.
[time=2827] So don't squirt out from under the pressure, but stay right there.
[time=2832] That's what the word persevere means.
[time=2835] It means to stand up under the pressure.
[time=2838] Very quickly, let me give you seven things that the New Testament tells us that we're to stand up under.
[time=2845] The first is we're to remain faithful in fruitful living, Luke 8, verse 15.
[time=2852] Fruitful living is the character of our life.
[time=2855] It's following Jesus and his characteristics, the fruit of the spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, gentleness, kindness, mercy, self-control.
[time=2868] When the whole world says, hey, tonight's the night, step out, you remain faithful in keeping your body under control.
[time=2877] When an individual treats you harshly and your instincts are to treat them back in kind, you instead treat them in kindness.
[time=2887] That's remaining faithful in Christian living.
[time=2892] Secondly, we are to remain under discipline.
[time=2896] That's what Hebrews 12, five through seven tells us.
[time=2899] It tells us that God, like a father, disciplines us.
[time=2903] And we are not to try to escape out from under his discipline.
[time=2907] Discipline can be on the one hand corrective.
[time=2911] You were wrong, bend over, here comes your discipline.
[time=2915] But Christians need to remember that discipline may not always be corrective, but it may be developmental.
[time=2922] A coach will discipline his team, not because they were bad, but because that's how he builds them.
[time=2929] Many an athlete has played under the bear of Alabama, or Vince Lombardian, Green Bay, Bobbie Knight at IU, or Woody Hayes at Ohio State, tough disciplinarians.
[time=2942] And many an athlete said, I wanna go somewhere else.
[time=2946] I wanna play for that coach, it's easier.
[time=2948] I wanna be on that team, they don't work as hard.
[time=2952] And many of us say, I don't like playing under God's thumb.
[time=2956] We wanna move out from under the discipline.
[time=2959] The Bible says, stay under it.
[time=2961] And secondly, we are to remain in well-doing.
[time=2964] Romans 2-7 tells us that, no matter what it takes, we follow the Lord.
[time=2972] We do what's right.
[time=2974] You may have gotten a promotion if you'd have done it the boss's way, just shave a corner.
[time=2978] Compromise a little bit on your ethics.
[time=2980] Don't be so stuffy.
[time=2982] You gotta do what's best for the company.
[time=2986] If you had you, you would have been promoted.
[time=2989] If you'd have just flirted a little bit with the boss.
[time=2993] He made the moves, but you didn't respond.
[time=2997] Now somebody else has gotten a good job.
[time=3000] As she responded, all it took was a little compromise.
[time=3004] You wanted to be accepted.
[time=3008] At your school, if you didn't do it their way, you didn't count.
[time=3011] And it was so painful to stand alone in a high school.
[time=3015] It was so difficult to say no when everyone else was saying yes.
[time=3019] And today you're flirting with defection.
[time=3025] Hang in there, well-doing.
[time=3028] A fourth thing it says that we are to remain faithful in the face of temptation.
[time=3033] When sin knocks on our door, when opportunity crosses our paths, or should our own hearts seek it, the Bible says blessed is the man who endures temptation for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life.
[time=3049] Don't defect, don't give in.
[time=3051] Fifthly, we are to remain under authority.
[time=3056] We are to be under the authority of the traffic officer who is polite and kind and stops us to remind us that we are going over the speed limit and was gonna give us a piece of paper to help our memory grasp that point.
[time=3070] And we are to be under the authority of the one who is obnoxious and says you're in a heap of trouble, boy.
[time=3078] We are to respect them all.
[time=3082] We are to respect those who are in leadership, whether we voted for them or against them, whether we endorse their policies or not.
[time=3090] We are to remain under authority, first Peter 220.
[time=3094] Sixthly, we are to remain under persecution.
[time=3097] In chapter 12 that we've been studying in verse four, it says this, in your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
[time=3107] He was saying to these Hebrew Christians, he knows it's hard, but you haven't yet had to give up your life for Christ.
[time=3115] Don't get out, just because the persecution's on.
[time=3118] Seventhly, we are to remain steadfast until Jesus comes.
[time=3124] It may be another 2,000 years, or it may be another two weeks, we don't know, but we are to remain faithful until he comes.
[time=3134] Third and finally, this race that is to be run is a race that is to be done, and it's a race that is to be won.
[time=3143] Christianity is being plagued by its own mediocrity.
[time=3149] Many of us are not running, but too many of us who are running are running with no desire to win.
[time=3155] And in the Christian life, there are two differences between this and the marathon.
[time=3161] The first difference is this.
[time=3162] In the marathon, only one person can win.
[time=3165] In the Christian life, we all can win.
[time=3167] We all can run, and we can all be found faithful to Christ.
[time=3171] We're not in it against each other, but we're in it together.
[time=3175] We can all win.
[time=3176] And secondly, we can help each other.
[time=3180] In the marathon, you can't receive assistance from anyone else, but in the Christian life, we can assist each other.
[time=3189] It's like the Tour de France, when Team USA is riding along, one guy will take the lead and let the others draft off of him for a little rest, and then they'll switch, and we can help each other by bearing each other's burdens, by admonishing and challenging each other.
[time=3205] John MacArthur challenges us with these words.
[time=3210] Nothing makes less sense than to be in a race which you have little desire to win.
[time=3215] Yet I believe that the lack of desire to win is the basic problem with many Christians.
[time=3221] They are content to be saved and to go to heaven.
[time=3225] Yet in a race, in a war, in the Christian life, lack of desire to win is unacceptable.
[time=3233] Paul, in 1 Corinthians chapter 9, does the same thing that Hebrews 12 does, and that is the analogy between the Christian life and the race.
[time=3243] But Paul switches his analogy, let me illustrate.
[time=3248] A number of years ago, at the end of the World Series, a team had gotten beat pretty quickly and pretty bad.
[time=3254] The interviewer was talking to the losing pitcher and asked how he felt, and he said, "Well, we would have liked to have won.
[time=3259] "Everybody wanted to win." But you know, at the beginning of the season, we never dreamed we'd make it this far.
[time=3264] It was just great to play in the series.
[time=3268] That's fine.
[time=3271] But you will never hear a boxer have that attitude.
[time=3276] He'll never walk into the ring.
[time=3278] Look at the opponent and say, "My, he's big.
[time=3281] "He is strong.
[time=3282] "He is fast." I really don't care whether I win or lose.
[time=3286] I'm just thrilled to come this far.
[time=3288] If a boxer goes in with anything less than a total commitment to excellence, he will have his nose ceremoniously placed where his ear used to be.
[time=3299] And so in 1 Corinthians 9, Paul starts off talking about the runner, and then he switches to the boxer and he says, "I fight not as one who beats the air." He said, "I'm committed to win." We must be committed to running for Christ
[time=3320] and running our whole life through until it is finished and done, and we must be committed to running so as to win.
[time=3328] Not just to say we were in the games,
[time=3334] not just to say we also ran, but so that at the end of the line, the Colosseum of heaven rises to their feet, and as we approach death, they're cheering for us to go, to finish, and when we collapse across the finish line into the arms of Jesus, we and they hear him say, "Well done, well done, now good and faithful servant." We must run to win.
[time=3362] Churchill was such a man.
[time=3364] After their miraculous invasion of Normandy, followed by the tremendous defeat, and then miraculous escape from Dunkirk, the war was not over, its darkest days were ahead.
[time=3381] Here was the state of England after Dunkirk.
[time=3386] When the evacuation was complete, half of the British destroyers were in the shipyards for repairs, while the Royal Air Force had lost 40% of its bomber's strength.
[time=3397] Britain was on the brink of famine.
[time=3401] Her armies were without arms or equipment.
[time=3405] 47 ships had been sunk in the operations off Norway and Dunkirk.
[time=3411] They had left 50,000 vehicles in Normandy.
[time=3419] Hitler was now planning to invade the island of England.
[time=3424] Churchill spoke these words to the defenseless island.
[time=3430] We shall defend our island, whatever the cost.
[time=3436] We shall fight on the beaches.
[time=3439] We shall fight in the fields.
[time=3441] We shall fight in the streets.
[time=3443] We shall fight in the hill.
[time=3445] We shall never surrender.
[time=3447] And if this island be subjugated and starving, our empire on the sea will carry on the struggle.
[time=3455] Until in God's good time, the new world with all of its power and might, steps forth to rescue and the liberation of the old.
[time=3464] So too, we must fight whatever the cost.
[time=3471] We are to live for Jesus Christ.
[time=3475] For some of you that will cost you the approval of your parents.
[time=3480] For others of you, it may cost you a promotion at job.
[time=3483] Some of you will be the blunt of jokes in the office.
[time=3488] Others of you will be excluded at your high school.
[time=3491] Some of you will no longer fit in at your college.
[time=3495] And the bottom line is this, when you're running for Jesus, refuse to quit.
