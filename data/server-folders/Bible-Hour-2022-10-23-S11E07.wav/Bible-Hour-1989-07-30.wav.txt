[time=112] The Greeks are famous for their Olympic Games.
[time=116] But in between the Olympic adds, they also had a group of things called the "Assmian Games." And at the "Assmian Games" there would be placed at the finish line, the victor's wreath, so that as the runner approached the finish line, he could focus his eyes on the goal, so that he could visualize what it was he was running for.
[time=138] A wreath, of leaves, perishable, soon to die.
[time=146] What are you running for?
[time=149] Will it last, or is it too, soon to die?
[time=167] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=170] Thank you for joining us.
[time=172] Rick's message today is entitled "Running the Real Race," "Remain Focused on Christ." For what are you running?
[time=180] The Greeks ran for a crown of leaves which would soon fade and die.
[time=185] That doesn't seem like much compared to the enormous contracts of many sports superstars.
[time=190] Yet even the gold medal of the Olympics, the green blazer of the master's golf tournament, and the millions won by the great Ali will fade away.
[time=198] So too will the athlete himself.
[time=201] If we are wise, we will run with our eyes on eternity, with our eyes on Jesus.
[time=206] That is the theme of Rick's message today on the Bible Hour.
[time=210] We hope you'll grab your Bible, open it to Hebrews 12, and study with us on remaining focused on Jesus.
[time=217] We will be looking at verses 1 through 3.
[time=220] Our special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir, Brian Whalen, and Denise Mitchell.
[time=231] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=239] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=245] Now, here's Rick.
[time=247] We are delighted that you would come and worship with us today.
[time=251] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television for the Bible Hour.
[time=256] It's our purpose today as we gather to praise God and our choir leads us in a quiet, devotional, Reverend Song, Praise Be to the Father.
[time=285] Praise Be to the Father.
[time=301] Praise Be to the Son.
[time=307] Praise Be to the Spirit.
[time=317] The God can breathe in one.
[time=324] God, we need to the Father.
[time=330] God, we need to the Son.
[time=341] The God can breathe in one.
[time=354] God, we need to the Father.
[time=359] God, we need to the Son.
[time=369] The God can breathe in one.
[time=381] Praise Be to the Father.
[time=387] Praise Be to the Son.
[time=393] Praise Be to the Spirit.
[time=398] The God can breathe in one.
[time=409] Praise Be to the Son.
[time=431] It's a special privilege to sing of the Trinity and recognize that God the Father, God the Son, the Holy Spirit, they'll make a unique contribution to our lives.
[time=442] Let's continue now and praise to the Lord as we sing Him number nine.
[time=446] Him number nine and we'll sing the first and third stanzas together.
[time=450] Praise Be to the Son.
[time=555] For your singing we continue in music now as Brian Whalen comes to minister to us.
[time=560] Let's listen as he sings.
[time=569] We love it now we are the sons of God adopted by his blood.
[time=584] We've been redeemed.
[time=587] We've been made joint heirs with Jesus and to reign as priests and kings.
[time=594] What do we say to these things since God is for us?
[time=606] Who can be against us?
[time=612] Since God is on our side how can we be denied?
[time=624] In all these things we are more than conquer us through Jesus Christ our Lord
[time=638] and nothing can separate us from the love of God.
[time=653] We're told that God is working everything for our good if we love a man we're called to do his will.
[time=664] Though the enemy tries to harm us and steal the song our heart would sing.
[time=671] Tell me what do we say to these things since God is for us?
[time=682] Tell me who can be against us since God is on our side how can we be denied?
[time=701] In all these things we are more than conquer us through Jesus Christ our Lord
[time=715] and nothing can separate us from the love of God.
[time=729] We're joys and triumph even in the time of trouble for nothing can compare to the glory that's in store.
[time=742] Hated for his sake we stand justified by faith.
[time=748] We'll be glorified with him forever more.
[time=756] Since God is for us.
[time=762] Tell me now who can be against us since God is on our side how can we be denied?
[time=782] In all these things we are more than conquer us through Jesus Christ our Lord
[time=795] and nothing can separate us from the love of God.
[time=842] Thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=845] It's our privilege to share our Sunday morning worship service with you friends by way of television.
[time=850] It's Sunday morning here you may be watching it delayed on a Sunday or Thursday or Saturday or another day of the week
[time=857] but we are thankful you're joining us today.
[time=860] Joining me here is my friend Jim Pearson who is a part of our pastoral staff and who's working on the leadership team of the Three Rivers Sunday School Convention.
[time=868] Jim you've got a unique event coming up for pastors.
[time=871] Yes Rick we certainly do.
[time=873] If you're a pastor this morning and you're preparing for your duties at church as you watch the Bible Hour
[time=879] we'd like to invite you to attend a free breakfast at Blackhawk Baptist Church on Tuesday morning at 8 a.m. August the 15th.
[time=887] The purpose of this breakfast is to inform you about the Three Rivers Sunday School Convention and some of the changes which we are making this year.
[time=895] The breakfast is sponsored by Scripture Press and of course our Three Rivers Sunday School Convention.
[time=900] We hope you can attend.
[time=902] When you come that morning we'll be telling you about some of the changes that we have made.
[time=906] The convention this year will be bigger and better than ever.
[time=909] We've added a music track which will be led by our own music minister Pete Coby.
[time=914] There will also be a special track on that morning for youth ministry oriented people and our pastor Tim Teder will also be here on that day to lead that track.
[time=923] If you are interested in attending this breakfast we would ask that you would please call Blackhawk Baptist Church
[time=929] at 4937400 ask for me or leave your name and address with our receptionist.
[time=936] We'll be glad to get you the information.
[time=938] Or you could write to Blackhawk Baptist Church 7400 East State Boulevard
[time=944] Fort Wayne Indiana the zip code is 46815.
[time=948] We would hope that you could come to this breakfast, catch the fire for the Sunday School Convention and then take it back to your local church.
[time=956] Spread it out among your choir members, your choir director.
[time=959] Also we would hope that you could get your Sunday School teachers to come that we might all gain in our work for Christ and just do a better job of leading children, doing a better job of leading our youth and in our music ministries.
[time=972] Well Jim you sure got this pastor's attention by mentioning a free breakfast.
[time=976] There are very few things that will get me moving more than free food so I'll be there on April.
[time=981] I keep saying April on August the 15th, Tuesday morning.
[time=985] Let me add to Jim's words, my encouragement to pastors, youth workers and ministers of music.
[time=990] This is a great opportunity to strengthen our skills and to pick up some helpful tools in leadership.
[time=996] We hope that you'll be there as a pastor on August the 15th.
[time=1000] Today I want to encourage you friends to write in for a brochure that will help you to be praying for our nation.
[time=1006] 1 Timothy chapter 2 tells us that we are to be praying.
[time=1010] Praying for leaders and praying for all who are in authority.
[time=1014] So we put together a prayer guide that lists the President, Vice President, all of the cabinet members, all of the justices of the Supreme Court, all the way down to some of the local officials so that you can be praying for our community, our state and our nation.
[time=1030] We'd love to mail you a copy if you'll simply write to us today.
[time=1034] Write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1042] and our zip code is 46815.
[time=1046] When you write ask for the prayer guide.
[time=1049] Write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1056] 46815.
[time=1059] Also joining me today is my friend Jeff Vaughn.
[time=1062] Jeff works here at Black Hawk as a volunteer directing our Sunlight Singles Fellowship and you too have an excellent opportunity for the community coming up.
[time=1071] I'm really excited about this Rick.
[time=1074] On August 17th, 18th and 19th we're going to sponsor a divorce recovery program.
[time=1080] This is being put on by a large church in Detroit, Michigan.
[time=1086] Andy Morgan is the Minister of Sunlight Singles up there and he is bringing himself and about 10 of his staff down here to our church to put this on.
[time=1099] It deals with getting your ex in focus and divorce recovery
[time=1105] and getting through divorce, your own identity, most importantly forgiveness.
[time=1110] The cost is a $25 donation but if you don't have that, if that's a problem, we want to share this with everybody in the community and we'd like you just to know that we can wave that.
[time=1122] We have a scholarship fund that we've got set up and we would like you to participate with that.
[time=1127] It's on Thursday night from 6.30 to 9.30.
[time=1131] On Friday night from 7 to 9.30 and then on Saturday morning from 9 to 2 o'clock
[time=1138] and lunch will be served on Saturday. That's a part of the program.
[time=1143] Jeff, how can people sign up to be a part of this?
[time=1146] All they need to do is call the church at 493 7400 and we'll send them a registration program, a registration brochure that they can simply fill out and send right back in.
[time=1159] They need to have that done by August 10th.
[time=1161] Jeff, thank you. Many of the counseling sessions I have are with people who are going through the tragedy of divorce.
[time=1169] I had a lady in this past week who said, "I didn't want a divorce.
[time=1172] I didn't have any choice. I'm just left with the pieces." And Jeff, I know she'll benefit by this.
[time=1178] And we do want to encourage you to come, be a part of this.
[time=1181] If this ministry will be of any help to you, again, you can either call here at the church office or write.
[time=1186] One final time our phone number is 4937400 and the address is 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1199] Thanks for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1213] [MUSIC]
[time=1221] We need the Lord.
[time=1226] We need to know His grace to seek His holy face above the world's acclaim.
[time=1240] We need the Lord.
[time=1245] We need His majesty to lend us dignity and make us worthy of His name.
[time=1260] We need to see Him there everywhere we turn.
[time=1269] We need to look for Him and how we need to learn how we need to learn.
[time=1285] We need the Lord.
[time=1291] We need His light to see what is eternity in ordinary daily things.
[time=1305] We need the Lord.
[time=1309] We need to sing to Him
[time=1315] when we have reached the end of all our earthly hopes and dreams.
[time=1324] And in the desert of our pain how we need the name
[time=1336] that He is alone when we stand through the night being His light
[time=1354] giving us hope.
[time=1359] [MUSIC]
[time=1364] We need the Lord.
[time=1368] We need to feel His touch.
[time=1373] We think we know so much but how much more we need to know.
[time=1382] We need the Lord.
[time=1387] We need His fire within
[time=1393] that we might live for Him and by His grace may grow
[time=1403] all how much we need all how much we need
[time=1415] all how much we need all how much we need We do need you Lord,
[time=1442] and we do love you.
[time=1444] We need you to meet with us today.
[time=1447] We need you to capture our hearts and to hold our imagination captive to dispel our preoccupation with the cares of this world.
[time=1459] We need you Lord to refresh us and to renew us.
[time=1465] We need you Lord to walk with us through the valleys and to give us wisdom when we are on the mountaintops.
[time=1472] We need you Lord to give us strength to be self-reliant and to give us wisdom than not the trust exclusively in ourselves but in you.
[time=1483] We need you to give us the inner sense of worth of how self-esteem and self-confidence and we need you to keep that from turning to pride and help us to find that unique balance in life.
[time=1499] Help us today not to be overcome with the depression of life's burdens are not to become exalted with our own sense of accomplishment in life's joy.
[time=1510] We need you.
[time=1512] We need you to open up our hearts and expose us.
[time=1517] You know us, we are masters at covering up our sin, our anger, our jealousy, our bitter, our hate.
[time=1526] We need you to reveal to us ourselves.
[time=1531] We need you to then forgive and to wash away what it is that your eye discerns and discovers.
[time=1539] We need to ask your strength today for those who walk through the hard times for Sue Torirak and the death of her father for Dottie Roadenbach and the loss of her sister.
[time=1552] We need to know your strength for those who are fighting for their health, even their lives, for those who are battling cancer, like Arden Marker and Jack Saylor, for Mark Deggitts who battles in an unknown yet to be named enemy that has robbed him of his health for years.
[time=1573] We need you, Lord, for those who are going through the pain of rejection to know that you, as Brian his son, will not stop loving and that nothing can separate us from your love.
[time=1589] We need you, Lord, to guide our lives with direction.
[time=1593] We need you to give peace to our relationships, healing to our families.
[time=1600] We need you to give perspective and vision to our living for Jesus' sake and selfishly for ours.
[time=1608] We ask it, amen.
[time=1611] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it into the book of Hebrews in the 12th chapter.
[time=1619] Hebrews, chapter 12, has as its backdrop the world of athletics.
[time=1625] It refers to the race that is set before us, and here God wants us to draw upon the physical world in which we live in, filled with athletic competition and races, to understand the spiritual world to which He has called us and to how we are to live for Him.
[time=1644] Hebrews 12 verses 1 through 3 reads like this.
[time=1648] Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
[time=1669] Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who, for the joy set before Him, endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1689] Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=1700] Well, this is our fourth out of four studies in these verses.
[time=1705] If you've liked them, it is drawing to a close.
[time=1708] If you have not liked them, then you'll certainly want to come next week when we do something brand new.
[time=1714] I love these verses.
[time=1716] I suppose if I was to pin down what are my favorite in the Bible, it would be these.
[time=1721] They are so practical, yet so deep, so livable, yet so challenging.
[time=1728] We've come up with four principles.
[time=1730] Let me remind you of them.
[time=1732] Principle number one is from the phrase, "Seeing that we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses." That teaches us to remember we are a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=1746] God has always had someone who would serve Him.
[time=1750] First, there was an Abraham, but He was followed by an Isaac.
[time=1754] Isaac was followed by a Jacob and Jacob by a Joseph.
[time=1758] Hebrews 11 portrays this continual relay of God's people.
[time=1764] And now the baton's placed in your hands and in mine.
[time=1769] And if we don't run, and if we don't run well, we not only lose for ourselves, but we lose for this eternal relay team.
[time=1779] We could slip into another dark ages.
[time=1783] The gospel and this continent could be lost if it's lost, but for one generation.
[time=1790] We need to serve Christ.
[time=1792] We need to run with the commitment or the runner who remembers he's a part of something bigger than himself.
[time=1799] We're a part of God's eternal relay team.
[time=1802] Secondly, we are to run releasing anything that holds us back.
[time=1808] Sin to be sure, like the athlete who disqualifies himself by the use of steroids, we can be disqualified because of sin in our lives.
[time=1818] Like the athlete who makes a lane violation or uses an illegal stroke and swimming, God can mark our lives as ineffective if stepping out of his bounds can be disqualified.
[time=1833] But we're not only set aside sin, but we are also to release anything that in and of itself may be good, but it's keeping us from giving God our best.
[time=1848] Oh, we're not saying that we only go to church, we only read our Bibles, we only think about Heaven.
[time=1854] Now, this church doesn't want to be one that is so heavenly-minded, it's no earthly good.
[time=1861] But into each of our lives there can come opportunities that become preoccupying that are good, but they keep us from giving God our best.
[time=1873] And like a runner who releases the outer garments, the heavy clothes, we're to release anything that holds us back.
[time=1881] The third principle was this one, we are to refuse to quit.
[time=1887] If you're like me, I'm built for the sprints, for the short haul.
[time=1892] But life is a marathon, it's to be run over the distance.
[time=1898] And this passage says we are to run with perseverance, staying power, hanging in there to the very end.
[time=1905] Have you ever seen the Ironman competition on television?
[time=1908] It's a relatively new sport called the triathlon.
[time=1911] You swim, and you bike, and then you run.
[time=1915] In the Ironman competition, you begin by swimming 2.4 miles.
[time=1921] It takes the good swimmers 45 minutes to an hour.
[time=1925] They don't do it in the neighborhood swimming pool where you can hang on to the wall every once in a while.
[time=1931] They do it in the open ocean, and they start you off against the waves.
[time=1936] And as soon as you swim, you're 2.4 miles.
[time=1939] You're expected to sprint out of the water, put on your shoes, and take off biking for a mere 112 miles.
[time=1947] The distance from here to Indianapolis, only the terrain they pick is not nearly so flat.
[time=1955] And as soon as you finish your stroll to Indianapolis, you're to jump off your bike, change your shoes, tell off your face, and immediately run a marathon.
[time=1964] I don't know about you, but I get tired thinking about all that.
[time=1970] What an endurance feat.
[time=1973] And yet some of you are in the middle of a spiritual triathlon.
[time=1977] Life has thrown a lot at you.
[time=1979] More than the next person in your pew has faced, more than the person in your pulpit has had to encounter.
[time=1985] And the urge to quit may be mounting.
[time=1988] This passage says, like the exhausted runner, refused to quit.
[time=1994] Our third and final principle, or excuse me, fourth, and final principle is this one, remain focused on Jesus.
[time=2004] Verse 2, "Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith." You see in athletics, how are you focused will to determine your performance?
[time=2020] Ted Williams was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, baseball player of all time when it came to hitting.
[time=2027] Ted Williams said that the secret to his success was his ability of his eye to focus on the ball.
[time=2034] Williams said that he could follow the ball from the moment it left the pitcher's hand until it met his bat.
[time=2040] He would concentrate.
[time=2042] He would focus.
[time=2043] He would stare and he could actually see the rotation of the ball as it was approaching, whether it was going to curve or sink, whether it was a fast bar or change-up.
[time=2053] His performance was controlled and determined by his focus.
[time=2060] The same thing is true in golf.
[time=2062] No one's throwing the ball at you.
[time=2064] It's just sitting there.
[time=2066] But your focus will determine your performance.
[time=2070] Never seemed reasonable to me that a pitcher could throw a ball at you 90 to 100 miles an hour, and all the fans are allowed to scream in the jeer and you have to take it.
[time=2079] In golf, you have a little ball sitting perfectly still and the crowd is supposed to be silent, so you can concentrate.
[time=2086] And yet the principal is exactly the same.
[time=2088] Your focus determines your outcome.
[time=2090] The most basic rule in golf, the one most commonly violated is keeping your eye on the ball.
[time=2096] The tendency is to swing at the ball and move your head to look to see where it's going.
[time=2100] And if you do, you won't find it.
[time=2102] It'll still be there.
[time=2104] The key in golf is to keep your head down to keep your eye on the ball until you swing through it.
[time=2109] They make t-shirts now for golfers with words on them, written upside down.
[time=2113] They read like this.
[time=2115] Keep your head down stupid, so that as you bend down, you have a little message to yourself.
[time=2123] Why?
[time=2124] Because the principal is the same.
[time=2126] Your focus determines your performance.
[time=2131] And in our spiritual life, the principal is the same.
[time=2135] Our focus determines our performance.
[time=2140] And we must focus on Jesus Christ.
[time=2145] If you focus on another Christian, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.
[time=2152] Because the best of us will fail at some point.
[time=2156] The best of us will make a subtle but clear error.
[time=2164] The best of us will take a liberty, which is okay for us, but not okay for you.
[time=2170] Or the best of us will take a liberty that's okay for you, but it's not okay for us.
[time=2176] The standard and the goal of our spiritual life isn't the guy in the pew or in the pulpit.
[time=2185] The focus of our life has to be Jesus Christ.
[time=2190] And the focus of our life has to be Him before and above everything else.
[time=2196] The focus of our eye has to be on Christ above our job, above our family, above our pursuit of a career or an athletic accomplishment.
[time=2205] The focus of Christ has to be above personal gratification of glory or pleasure.
[time=2211] We must focus our eyes on Him because our focus will determine our performance.
[time=2220] We're to look at Jesus because He is the only one who serves as a Savior, and He is the only one who serves as a model for living.
[time=2234] In John chapter 3 verse 14, Jesus said, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness," what does that mean?
[time=2242] Well, in the Old Testament it tells us that the children of Israel were bitten by lethal snakes, and the only thing that would save them is if they by faith looked up at a serpent that Moses held up on a pole.
[time=2257] If they looked, they lived.
[time=2260] Nothing happened physiologically by looking.
[time=2265] It didn't change the blood for or the chemistry of the venom.
[time=2268] It was a miracle of God that if they looked, they lived.
[time=2273] Jesus said, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so shall I be lifted up and draw all men into myself." Jesus Christ was lifted up on a cross, and if we look at Him, not with a glance and say, "Yeah, that's Jesus," but if we look at Him as our Savior and our Lord and we receive Him as such, a miracle takes place.
[time=2306] God takes all the poison of our sin, all the venom of every wrong thought and every spoken word, and He miraculously forgives them, and He gives us eternal life.
[time=2320] But the primary thrust of this passage is looking at Jesus in the second way, looking at Him as the model of faith.
[time=2330] We are to look at Jesus according to Philippians 2, 5.
[time=2336] Let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus.
[time=2342] We are to look at Him as the one who did live His life by faith and die by faith, having finished what He started.
[time=2355] The focus of our life has to be on Jesus.
[time=2360] In between the Olympiads, the Greeks celebrated what were called the Ismian games.
[time=2365] In the Ismian games, at the end of the race was a pedestal.
[time=2369] On top of the pedestal, the crown that the victor would wear.
[time=2373] It was positioned there so that as the runners were finishing the race, they would see the goal and they would focus on it and not focus on the distraction of the crowd or focus on who else was running and about to catch them, but to focus on the goal.
[time=2389] We must focus our eyes on Jesus.
[time=2394] And this verse, 12-2 out of Hebrews, gives us three reasons why we should focus on Him.
[time=2400] Reason number one is this.
[time=2402] Jesus had the determination to both start and to finish the race.
[time=2409] It says, "Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author, and the perfecter of our faith." He's both the one who started it and he is the one who finished it.
[time=2424] He is the starter because he is absolutely the author of salvation.
[time=2430] The Bible tells us that before you were born, Jesus loved you.
[time=2435] The Bible tells us before this world was created, Jesus loved you, and that God made a series of decrees, of decisions.
[time=2447] First, God decided that he was going to create a world.
[time=2452] And then before he created that world, he made a second decision that he was going to create people as free agents.
[time=2460] He said, "I'm going to create people so that they can choose to follow me or choose not to follow me." You know, God could have made us a pre-programmed computerized robot that whatever decision was put in front of us, we would calculate what God wanted us to do and do it.
[time=2477] But instead, God decided to make us as free agents with the resources to follow him or to reject him.
[time=2486] And then God in his wisdom knew that we would choose the sin and to disobey him.
[time=2493] So God the Father and God the Son made a third decision.
[time=2497] And that was that Jesus would come and he would die for our sins.
[time=2502] You see, Jesus authored that whole plan before the world was ever created.
[time=2507] That's how much he loves you.
[time=2509] That's how much he cares about you.
[time=2512] And he is the author of Salvation.
[time=2515] But more than that, he is also the author of the faith by which we are to live today.
[time=2521] Because that same Jesus who loved us before the world began came into the world he created as a man, and he literally faced every temptation you ever faced.
[time=2532] You ever faced a temptation to meet your own needs by simply stepping out of bounds spiritually?
[time=2539] Jesus faced that.
[time=2540] He was hungry.
[time=2541] Great understatement of the Bible is this.
[time=2543] Jesus fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, and afterwards he was hungry.
[time=2550] And Jesus was faced with the temptation.
[time=2552] He just turned these stones into bread.
[time=2555] Would there be something sinful about that?
[time=2557] Not at all.
[time=2559] He could multiply fish and loaves into bread to feed others.
[time=2562] Why couldn't he turn stones into bread to feed himself?
[time=2566] Because that wasn't the temptation.
[time=2569] The temptation was to act independent from God.
[time=2574] And he had committed himself to acting dependent upon God and he refused to use his own power to meet his own needs when he was called to trust God.
[time=2586] Have you ever been faced with that temptation?
[time=2589] You've got a need.
[time=2591] You've got a way of meeting it.
[time=2593] All you have to do is compromise on the spiritual ledger.
[time=2597] And Jesus is the author of our faith because he refused to do that.
[time=2603] Hebrews 4 tells us that Jesus was tempted on all points just like we are.
[time=2610] You're facing sexual temptation.
[time=2612] Christ faced it.
[time=2614] You're facing financial pressure.
[time=2617] Jesus said the foxes have holes and the birds have nests.
[time=2621] I don't have anywhere to lay my head.
[time=2624] Facing loneliness and rejection.
[time=2628] Jesus was despised and rejected.
[time=2633] Ben betrayed.
[time=2636] So was he.
[time=2638] Ben mistreated.
[time=2640] So was he.
[time=2642] Somebody broke their promise, their covenant.
[time=2645] He knew that pain.
[time=2647] And yet, though he was tempted on all points like we are, he was without sin.
[time=2654] He's the author of a faith that we can live by.
[time=2657] He knew the heat.
[time=2659] Three times before he was crucified, he said, "Father, let this all pass from me.
[time=2668] Let's change the plan." Yet at the end of that prayer each time he said, "Nevertheless, not my will, but yours.
[time=2678] He is the author of our faith." And he is the perfecter of our faith.
[time=2683] He is the one who finished it.
[time=2686] And starting is easy.
[time=2689] Finishing is tough.
[time=2692] Have you ever started a diet but didn't finish it?
[time=2696] Started a maintenance project at home but haven't finished it.
[time=2700] Started a commitment that this is the year I'm going to read my Bible regularly.
[time=2705] Didn't stick to it.
[time=2707] Have you ever begun to extend forgiveness and then pulled back?
[time=2711] Have you ever started to serve in a ministry and quit before your tour of duty was finished?
[time=2718] Have you begun to engage in the spiritual warfare and found yourself AWOL?
[time=2726] Jesus not only started, but he finished.
[time=2732] Shortly before his crucifixion he prayed, "Father, I have glorified you on earth.
[time=2737] I have finished the work that you have sent me to do." One of his last words on the cross was this phrase, "It is finished.
[time=2749] It is finished." We are to look to Jesus, to focus on him because he had the determination to run the race from start to finish.
[time=2763] And right now, while you're in the middle of your spiritual race, while you're in the middle of your pilgrimage and you face the urge to quit, if you look, you'll find another Christian who quit.
[time=2775] If you look, you'll find another church that folded.
[time=2778] If you look, you'll find somebody else who defected.
[time=2782] But if you look at Jesus, you'll see one who started and who finished and he will be your motivation and he will be your strength.
[time=2793] There's a second reason why we're to look to Jesus.
[time=2797] Jesus had the discernment.
[time=2800] Jesus had the discernment to see beyond the immediate and gain the ultimate.
[time=2808] In life, we're in a constant battle of what is going to be the easiest or the best right now is probably not going to be the easiest or the best in the ultimate.
[time=2818] But Jesus had the discernment to see beyond the immediate to the ultimate.
[time=2823] It says this in Hebrews 12, 2.
[time=2826] Jesus, who for the joy that was set out there before him in the ultimate endured the cross, the immediate.
[time=2837] He despised the shame.
[time=2839] He didn't want it, but he took it and he sacrificed the pleasure of the immediate for gaining the ultimate.
[time=2850] In chapter 12, verse 16, it gives us an illustration of that.
[time=2855] It says this.
[time=2856] See to it that no one is sexually immoral or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.
[time=2867] Do you remember that story out of Genesis?
[time=2869] Here's Esau.
[time=2871] Big, burly, kind of an outdoorsman.
[time=2875] He had been two times on the cover of Field and Stream magazine.
[time=2879] He was the man's man of the day, and he went out hunting, and it was an unusually bad day.
[time=2886] He caught nothing, either fishing or hunting, and he came home hungry.
[time=2892] As he approached the tent, he smelled something better than the usual scent of camel.
[time=2898] And here was younger brother, Jacob, not the outdoorsman, not the hunter, the manipulator, egged on by a conniving mother who had cooked a very aromatic meal and waited for a big brother to come with his tongue hanging out, his stomach churning, and his eyes wanting it.
[time=2924] Would you like something to eat Esau as he picked up a ladle full and let it plop plop plop down into the pop?
[time=2931] Smell it's good.
[time=2932] You want some?
[time=2933] Well, the immediate was too much for Esau.
[time=2937] Sure he wanted it, and Jacob only asked for one thing.
[time=2940] Just give me your birthright.
[time=2942] You know, it's way down in the future.
[time=2944] Don't worry about the future.
[time=2945] Just now.
[time=2946] Give me your birthright, and I'll give you what you want.
[time=2950] And like a fool, Esau traded the ultimate for the immediate.
[time=2956] Chapter 12, verse 16 likens those of us who compromise sexually the same way.
[time=2962] There's pleasure to be had now.
[time=2966] There's pleasure to be had as a student.
[time=2969] Why not engage sexually?
[time=2971] It's now.
[time=2972] It's immediate because God standard his purity, and if you will honor him ultimately, he will honor you.
[time=2981] In the office, everybody else has something on the side.
[time=2986] Why not you?
[time=2989] It's here.
[time=2990] It's now.
[time=2991] It's immediate.
[time=2994] But ultimately, you break the covenant you made with your spouse and with our God in your sacrificing, the ultimate on the altar of the immediate.
[time=3007] Often, our choice is between gratifying ourselves and glorifying God.
[time=3014] It's the battle we face in every area of our life.
[time=3017] It's the battle the credit card shopper has to face.
[time=3020] I can buy it now.
[time=3023] But ultimately, they will remind you once every month how much you owe.
[time=3028] It's the battle that those of us who under discipline our children face.
[time=3033] Right now, it's too hard to drop the newspaper, turn down the TV set and get out of the easy chair and say, "Son, come here." It's just easier to let it go, but ultimately, a son goes awry.
[time=3046] And it's the same battle that those of us who over discipline face.
[time=3050] Right now, we just immediately let our anger fly and we justify it because we're disciplining when we're really ventilating our own hostility.
[time=3059] And ultimately, they learn that discipline is to be hated and it's fierce and it's unfair.
[time=3066] It's the same battle that we face in our jobs when profitability is a long way away, but it could be had now with just a few corners shaved and all of your competitors do it anyway.
[time=3080] The battle between the ultimate and the immediate.
[time=3085] Here was Jesus' immediate.
[time=3087] In front of him was the cross.
[time=3090] How bad was it?
[time=3092] F.F. Bruce, New Testament scholar writes, "From so degrading a death, Roman citizens were exempted by ancient statute.
[time=3103] The dignity of Rome would be besmirked by being brought into association with anything as vile as the cross." That's what was in front of Jesus.
[time=3116] The cross.
[time=3119] And he could choose to avoid it.
[time=3123] That was his prayer.
[time=3124] God take it away.
[time=3127] He could have pointed an omnipotent finger at Roman soldiers and they would have dropped dead.
[time=3132] He could have made a glance at his accusers and froze them in time and space.
[time=3137] As the hymn writer put it, he could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free.
[time=3147] Those were his immediate choices.
[time=3150] But instead he took the option of voluntarily and willingly dying on the cross.
[time=3156] Why?
[time=3157] For the ultimate.
[time=3159] For the joy that was set before him.
[time=3163] Because Jesus saw that beyond the pain, beyond the suffering, beyond the loneliness, beyond the rejection, beyond the dying on the other side of all.
[time=3174] That ultimately there was the joy that you and you and you and each of us could have our sins forgiven because he, in the words of another songwriter, paid it all.
[time=3189] Jesus paid it all.
[time=3191] All the hymn I owe.
[time=3193] Sin had left a crimson stain.
[time=3195] He washed it white as snow.
[time=3199] And Jesus saw the joy of our forgiveness and our eternal life.
[time=3205] And he said, I will not compromise and sacrifice the ultimate on the altar of the immediate.
[time=3212] We are to fix our eyes on Jesus because he alone had the determination to run this race from start to finish.
[time=3221] We are to fix our eyes on Jesus because he had the discernment to live for the ultimate and not the immediate.
[time=3228] And finally we should fix our eyes on Jesus because he has the delight of his reward.
[time=3235] It says that Jesus having gone through the cross, having despised its shame, having endured it all, he has now sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=3247] Philippians put it this way, that Jesus became obedient unto death, even death upon a cross.
[time=3255] Wherefore, God has highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow and every tongue should confess to the glory of God that he is Lord.
[time=3271] And right now, Jesus is enjoying the delight of his reward.
[time=3279] He is no longer in the cross.
[time=3281] He is no longer in a tomb.
[time=3283] He is at this very moment, positioned at the right hand of God.
[time=3289] On a throne.
[time=3291] Some scholars believe that the phrase "right hand signifies co-regency" because Jesus was always God.
[time=3299] He chose to enter human form for thirty-some years in the day for our sins and now he is re-elevated to his rightful position as a co-regent with God.
[time=3310] He is King of kings and Lord of lords.
[time=3313] And if we fix our eyes on him, we see one who endured it all and now has the delight of his reward.
[time=3321] And if we fix our eyes on him, we will wisely run and live for him so that we can enjoy the delight of our rewards.
[time=3332] They are chiefly these two.
[time=3334] First, and I believe the greatest, is the reward that having lived and run for Christ, having gone the distance refusing to quit, that on the moment we die or the day that he comes for us, whichever way it is that we step into his presence, he looks at us face to face and he says, "Well done.
[time=3356] Well done, now good and faithful servant.
[time=3360] And nothing this world has to offer in the praise of men or the possessions of the earth compares to his voice saying to us, "Well done." The second reward that we will have is the reward of crowns.
[time=3379] The runner in these races ran for a crown.
[time=3382] There are two types of crowns.
[time=3384] There is a diadem, a precious metal crown inlaid with jewels that signifies royalty.
[time=3391] But the runner didn't run for a diadem, he ran for a Stefanos.
[time=3396] Stefanos was the victor's crown.
[time=3398] It was simply a crown that was made out of a clipped branch that was curved and wrapped and perhaps bound in some way to form a wreath.
[time=3408] It would soon wither.
[time=3410] Its leaf would brown and die and drop.
[time=3416] The Bible says we run for a crown, but not a perishable one but an imperishable one.
[time=3422] And when we get to having the greatest thing is this, it's not going to be a big award ceremony where your name is called up and you're ceremoniously presented with the crowns.
[time=3431] Instead of the presentation being made to us, whatever crowns we have, crowns of a martyr, crowns of suffering, crowns of overcoming temptation, crowns of loving his appearance, whatever we have, we are going to take them and we are going to cast them at his feet and we are going to sing "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain." Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and glory and honor.
[time=3456] For thou hast created all things and for thy glory, they were in our created.
[time=3463] We are to look at Jesus.
[time=3466] He is the one who had the determination to run it from start to finish.
[time=3471] He is the one that had the discernment to live for the ultimate, not the immediate.
[time=3477] We are to live for Jesus, for he is the one that has the delight of his reward and he will take those who have received him into heaven and he will take all who received him and have served him and refused the quit and he will give them their reward.
[time=3498] Well done, thou good and faithful servant and we will have a crown to cast at his feet.
