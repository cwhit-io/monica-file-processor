[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=120] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study and Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=124] Thank you for joining us.
[time=126] Today marks the beginning of our annual month of emphasis on missions here at Black Hawk.
[time=130] Don Trot of the Association of Baptists for World of Angelism will be our featured speaker.
[time=136] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us as Mr. Trot shares with us what the Lord has laid on his heart.
[time=144] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=148] Other special music will be provided by celebration.
[time=153] And Corinne sycophus.
[time=157] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=164] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=170] Now, here's Rick.
[time=171] For our second worship service and we hope that today you will have your hearts directed to God
[time=177] and you'll know him personally.
[time=179] We also want to welcome our friends who join us for the Bible hour and trust that God will use this in your life.
[time=186] We're in this month emphasizing missions.
[time=189] By that we mean the sending of people who know Jesus Christ to places where Jesus Christ is not known.
[time=197] But it begins with a personal understanding that my life has a mission.
[time=202] It has nothing to do with careers or continents but an inner sense of mission.
[time=208] Our mission is to know Jesus Christ and to make him known because he alone is the Savior.
[time=214] It's our privilege to hear our choir and our brass accompanists sing and play for us the truth that Jesus saves.
[time=232] [MUSIC - 191 seconds]
[time=438] [APPLAUSE]
[time=443] I would have joined you to proclaim that Jesus indeed saves lives, changes from within that sinful nature that we have.
[time=451] We continue with the power of Jesus' name as we sing all hail the power of Jesus' name, number 97, please, number 97.
[time=461] We'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=465] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=578] It's a great encouragement when you sing that way, these great truths from the word put to music.
[time=583] We appreciate it when you participate, thank you very much.
[time=586] Continue with music now as celebration comes to minister to us.
[time=590] Let's listen as they have a song that will fit and is very purposeful for our theme today.
[time=596] [MUSIC]
[time=610] The highest call is on my life, living for Jesus no matter what price.
[time=630] There's a crowd of life for those who give their all, living for Jesus, accepting the highest call.
[time=654] We're coming of God's kingdom, as certain as the dawn, a sense upon this dark and dying land.
[time=674] Lord God, I hear your calling, my faith, my new my own.
[time=685] And in your spring I vow to make my stay, the highest call is on my life, living for Jesus no matter what price.
[time=714] There's a crowd of life for those who give their all, living for Jesus, accepting the highest call.
[time=766] [MUSIC]
[time=776] Thank you for being a part of the Bible hour again today.
[time=779] I have with me my friend Steve Longbreak, Pete and the other auditorium getting the orchestra ready.
[time=785] Steve, good morning and welcome.
[time=787] Thank you, I'm glad to be here.
[time=789] Steve is the administrator of our school here at Blackhawk and also my jogging buddy.
[time=794] How many did you put in yesterday?
[time=796] I didn't run yesterday, I was at a wedding and the heat was a little bit prohibitive, so I stayed in the house in the air conditioning.
[time=802] Well, those don't ask me because I didn't make it out yesterday either.
[time=805] We want to encourage you to join us on September the 16th for a concert with Buddy Green.
[time=811] Many of you will remember Buddy, he was on the Bible hour about a year ago, he's traveled extensively with Bill Gather and his group.
[time=819] Buddy Green is an outstanding vocalist, guitar player, but you'll remember him as the harmonica player.
[time=826] He can play a harmonica like no one else.
[time=829] Steve, I don't know whether you remember when we were growing up, but we had a harmonica player we listened to on the radio, Stevie Wonder.
[time=835] Twelve years old, I remember that.
[time=837] Mr. Harmonica Man.
[time=839] Well, I'll go on record as saying Buddy Green is better than Stevie Wonder.
[time=843] He can play the harmonica, he can make it sound like a Jewish chant, he can make it sound contemporary, and he can play the William Tell Overture, which I had to ask Pete if that was it.
[time=857] But the William Tell Overture was the theme song for the Lone Ranger, that may help you out.
[time=862] He can make that harmonica sound like there's a whole orchestra.
[time=866] It is a fun time and a very encouraging time, and by the time it's done, it's also been a time where our hearts have been uplifted to praise God.
[time=875] We're having a concert here on September the 16th, that's a Saturday night, it'll be in the New Worship Center, and if you would like tickets, you can call us here at Blackhawk, or you can pick them up at any of the local Christian bookstores.
[time=888] I hope you'll set that night aside and join us for the Buddy Green Concert, it'll be a night you'll never forget, and you'll be glad you had a part of.
[time=897] Steve's here today to tell us about our school, Steve, I have three children in the school and couldn't be happier, how are things shaping up for the new school year?
[time=906] Things are hectic right now, getting started is always a really tough job, but we have so many teachers coming back, our average teacher has been here for eight years now.
[time=917] And so we only had to hire one person to replace one teacher that left last year, and we're really grateful for that, so it's a little easier than it might be other times.
[time=926] Well Steve has mentioned the longevity of our teachers and the need to only replace one of those, that is a strong tribute to a school that you're getting experienced, quality teachers, and in fact the only reason why we had to replace one is because the church hired her away from you.
[time=943] That's right, our pastor did that to me. Well that was very unkind of him, but you'll forgive him I trust? Certainly do.
[time=949] Oh that's good. Well Steve's here today because in four grades is that right we have openings? That's correct, in kindergarten and first grade we have openings because we're beginning to double track our school.
[time=960] That means we'll be having two classes in every grade, excuse me, rather than just one, and then in seven and twelve we also have a couple openings, so it's kindergarten first, seventh and twelfth grade we now have openings.
[time=972] Unfortunately that means for second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh we do not have openings. We do have a waiting list, I don't want to be overly optimistic about that either, but for kindergarten, first grade, seventh and twelfth are our openings.
[time=988] That's right, please call us. We would be very happy to send you information about our school, or you might drop in and talk to us at 7400 East State Street. We'd be glad to share anything we could with you and take you on a tour of the building, talk to you about our curriculum and so forth.
[time=1003] If you would like to call the church phone number and the school phone number is one and the same, it is 493, 7400, and you can call Monday through Friday between eight and four I believe are the summer hours.
[time=1018] Also today we want to encourage you to write for a publication, we've put together here, it was my privilege to draft this booklet that we've called Jesus Christ, Our Lord. It is a four chapter booklet on the deity of Christ.
[time=1034] To give you an overview in chapter one we talk about why we believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. What is the evidence that supports that? Why don't we believe that he's just a great religious leader like Moses or Mohammed or Confucius or Buddha?
[time=1051] But we take Jesus and we put him in a whole different category. We say he's not just a religious leader telling us about God, but he was God in human form.
[time=1062] In chapters two and three we talk about the resurrection. We look very specifically at the Passover plot, the belief that Jesus really didn't die on the cross. He came close to death and swooned.
[time=1074] And then he was revived by his disciples and propped up as though he had actually in power been risen from the dead. We look at the reality of that and show the holes in the swoon theory and then the evidence for the actual resurrection of Christ.
[time=1091] In the last chapter we show what is it that we believe is Christians that's different from all the cults. We'd like to send you this booklet and hope you'll write to us. It'd be free. We'll mail it to you so you could have it.
[time=1103] Write to us here at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. And while you're writing, would you take the time to give us a paragraph or at the most of page that tells us how God has used this ministry in your life?
[time=1122] Maybe you're like the individual who wrote to us last week requesting literature because they had asked Christ into their heart or perhaps this ministry has helped you to recommit your life to Christ.
[time=1132] Or maybe it's carried you through the difficult, loss of a loved one. Write to us, ask for the booklet and tell us your story. One final time, our address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1151] Steve, thank you and thank you for joining us here today.

[time=1340] [MUSIC - 13 seconds]
[time=1372] Thank you, Corinne. Have you had an experience this week where you wish that the rocks would just split and form a crack so that you could crawl in and hide?
[time=1382] As life beat you up, left you down, you wish there was a place of refuge, a sanctuary, a place that you could scurry for protection.
[time=1394] God says like the animal in a storm that races for a cleft in the rock, so I'll be your hiding place. I'll be your protection. Run to me.
[time=1407] God, we thank you today that you are our God, that you will protect us, that you will shelter us, that you'll open up the rocks and give us a sanctuary in yourself.
[time=1421] We've come today to admit that we have been too casual as believers. We have been distant from you that we've been preoccupied by, as Jesus put it, the cares of this world.
[time=1437] Help us to seek first your kingdom. Help us to desire to please you more than anyone else, including ourselves.
[time=1449] As we open our hearts to you today, we want you to speak to us. We want to know your word and your will.
[time=1459] We pray that you would give us insight for a living, give to all of our pursuits a deeper sense of mission in life.
[time=1468] Father, we ask you to meet with us, to give joy to those who sorrow, strength to those who are weak.
[time=1478] We pray particularly for the Hindus as Greg undergoes chemotherapy for leukemia.
[time=1486] And for the clefs as Ryan at this very moment may be having an appendectomy.
[time=1492] For the reggates as Little Matt is diagnosed this week as to whether he has or does not have Crohn's.
[time=1500] We pray for George's son Dan, Bill Vandiford, Jeff Popwell and others who battle that fierce enemy of Crohn's.
[time=1510] We pray your encouragement on our families, particularly for men that you would as Dr. Dobbs and so well put it.
[time=1518] Lord, turn our hearts towards home. And now as we study your word, we thank you for bringing Don to speak to us and ask you to use him to direct our lives in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1535] Three years ago, though it seems only like three months ago, Kathy and I had the privilege of being in Kofu, Japan.
[time=1543] There we were visiting a missionary from our church, Mary Cruz. She was helping Christ Church at Kofu.
[time=1551] Kofu is the city the size of our city in terms of population, yet there was only one church.
[time=1557] So you needed no other distinction than Christ Church at Kofu.
[time=1563] We had a delightful time there. We ate things that we hope never to eat again.
[time=1568] Actually, I ate them. Kathy looked at things that she hoped neither one of us would ever eat or look at again.
[time=1574] But we fell in love with those people.
[time=1577] We sat in Mary's apartment with Mary and the pastor of Christ Church at Kofu, Sosei Mizoguchi, is a delightful, godly man.
[time=1588] His church is a sizable church for Japan of 60 to 70 people.
[time=1594] Mary was the only missionary in this community, and she was relieved to go serve in Yokohama.
[time=1602] Pastor Mizoguchi looked at Kathy and at me.
[time=1606] He said, "Miss Mary tells us there are over 1,500 people in your church."
[time=1612] "Is this true?" I said, "Yes, it is true."
[time=1618] He said, "Miss Mary is leaving us. If you have 1,500 people, could you send us just one?"
[time=1628] I wish that that day I could say, "Pastor Mizoguchi, we will send you one." I know of one who will come. I could only say, "We will pray that out of this church, God would send one to Kofu, Japan."
[time=1642] We're grateful that God has sent the balls to Panama, the Falkner's back to South America.
[time=1649] He has sent the cranes to Africa. He has sent Ruth to Bangladesh. She has raised up people.
[time=1655] None has yet to go to Kofu. I hope God would send one of us.
[time=1660] But whether we go to Kofu or we stay in Fort Wayne, it's our heart's desire that each of us sends that we have a mission in life,
[time=1669] that knows no cultural distinction, that knows no career distinction and knows no country distinction,
[time=1676] that we are ambassadors for Christ in our cul-de-sacs, in our workplace, wherever we're at.
[time=1684] And so with that emphasis, we present a month of missions, and we've asked Don Trot, who works with A.B.W.E. Association of Baptist for World Evangelism
[time=1694] to come and to challenge our heart with a sense of missions. Don, welcome to Blackhawk.
[time=1702] It's a real joy to be here this morning, to open God's Word with you, asking the Spirit of God
[time=1709] who would minister to each of our hearts as we consider the theme of missions.
[time=1717] The Association of Baptist for World Evangelism has over 1,000 in his total mission family,
[time=1724] serving in 26 countries of the world. We're grateful to God for the great army that he has raised up to carry that glorious message of salvation
[time=1734] to the corners of the world, yet even with that great mission family, we're losing ground
[time=1742] for with the 1989 candidate school completed, new missionaries appointed, already we've had more missionaries retire,
[time=1752] come home sick, therefore unable to go back, or we're taken home by death
[time=1759] than the number we received in candidate school in 1989.
[time=1764] I understand that's happening to most evangelical mission agencies across this nation of ours.
[time=1770] It ought to cause us to awaken to the urgency of the need and the lateness of the hour to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out
[time=1778] and to examine our hearts as to whether or not God would want us to leave our confines
[time=1786] that we often find so comfortable to go to the uttermost part of the earth to carry that message of salvation.
[time=1794] Great opportunities are available to us. The doors are open and we need to proceed through them.
[time=1803] We take your Bibles in turn with me to John chapter 20. John chapter 20.
[time=1813] Little over a year ago, I was seated at the head table of a banquet.
[time=1822] Now I was not overly enthused about sitting at the head table, but I was enthused about talking to the individual that was seated to my left.
[time=1832] I had been with him on various airplane trips. I had met him in person on previous occasions,
[time=1840] but never had I had the privilege of sitting down and talking to him face to face and asking him questions
[time=1848] that frankly were utmost upon my mind as a related to the positions he's held in government here in the United States of America.
[time=1859] The man seated to my left was the former governor of the state of Pennsylvania and UN ambassador under Gerald Ford, William Scranton,
[time=1870] a man whom I revere very highly and respected him as he executed the various responsibilities,
[time=1879] both as governor of the state of Pennsylvania as well as UN ambassador.
[time=1885] We chatted for a brief period of time and then I turned to him and I said, "Governor Scranton, can I ask you a few questions?"
[time=1894] And he said to me, "Fine, you can ask them. I have no guarantee that I have the answers."
[time=1900] And I said, "Governor, when President Ford came to you and asked you to take the position of UN ambassador,
[time=1910] what were some of the things he laid before you?" Some of the questions he asked, some of the directives he gave you.
[time=1917] "Just share with me briefly what transpired at that period of time." He said to me, "Don, you need to keep in mind that Jerry and I knew each other for over 30 years. We knew each other well."
[time=1932] One of the things, however, that has stuck in my mind that he stated to me was this.
[time=1938] He said, "Remember, Bill, if you take this position, you are not to represent the political party
[time=1946] that you have represented in the past, namely the Republican Party, nor the peoples of the United States,
[time=1954] nor your own political views while in the UN.
[time=1958] But rather, Jerry, Bill, you are to recognize that you are my representative in the UN.
[time=1967] I cannot be in the White House and the UN at the same time. Therefore, you are representing me in that position.
[time=1975] Therefore, I want you to look to me for directives as it relates to how you are to best represent me there."
[time=1984] And he said, "Furthermore, I want to remind you, as you well know, I am a conservative individual,
[time=1992] particularly in dress, and therefore I am asking my staff, as they represent me, to dress conservatively."
[time=2001] Because he said, "I want you to mirror me in that position."
[time=2007] Governor Scranton chuckled, and he said to me, "By the way, end of all I have done in the political realm,
[time=2015] why do you ask concerning that specific office or position?" And I said to him, "Governor Scranton, Jesus Christ has called me to be his ambassador
[time=2030] to carry the message of salvation to the ends of the earth.
[time=2035] I have been given the responsibility to share with mankind who knows not Jesus Christ as their Savior
[time=2042] how he died for them upon the cross of Calvary and that through him they might have life and have it more abundantly.
[time=2050] And therefore I wanted to see how our responsibilities paralleled one another.
[time=2057] Turning to me, as an unsaved man, he looked me in the face leaning forward on the table
[time=2064] and said to me, "Don, I've never carried a position that high with that much responsibility,
[time=2072] nor have I ever shared a message of that much importance."
[time=2083] Then he turned to me and said something I shall never forget.
[time=2086] He said, "Don, do it well. Don't let the one who called you to that position be ashamed
[time=2099] that he called you because of the poor job you did in that position."
[time=2109] God used that in a marvelous way to awaken me to the awesome responsibility he had given to me
[time=2116] and to every born-again believer as we take that message of salvation to lost mankind.
[time=2121] Mankind who is groping in darkness, searching for some meaning to life,
[time=2128] they're trying drugs, alcohol, sex, whatever they can find to bring that inner fulfillment.
[time=2135] When the Bible says that that fulfillment comes in and through the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2143] In John chapter 20, our Lord is soon to ascend to the Father's right hand.
[time=2149] He has died upon the cross of Calvary, bearing in his body the penalty for mankind's sin
[time=2158] and providing salvation for all those who would place their faith in him.
[time=2164] The Bible tells us in John chapter 20 that Mary in verse 16 had met him.
[time=2175] Then as we move down to verse 18, Mary came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord
[time=2185] and that he had spoken these things unto her, verse 19.
[time=2193] Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week when the doors were shut
[time=2199] where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst
[time=2205] and said unto them, "Peace be unto you." And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side.
[time=2215] Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord, then said Jesus to them again, "Peace be unto you as my Father has sent me, even so, send I you."
[time=2231] During those critical hours of the crucifixion, the disciples had abandoned the Savior,
[time=2237] that hour in which he needed them to comfort him and to care for him.
[time=2243] They had denied him. They had left him.
[time=2247] And now we find them gathered in an upper room.
[time=2251] John very clearly depicts for us the setting.
[time=2256] The doors, plural, were shut, undoubtedly the outer gate that surrounded the home in which they were to be found was shut, as well as the door into that room.
[time=2268] The Bible says it was the evening of that same day, the first day of the week.
[time=2274] And as they were gathered in that room, undoubtedly fear gripped their hearts.
[time=2279] They had fled the temple police and the Roman guards.
[time=2283] For fear they would be identified with arisen Savior and possibly persecuted for their identification with him.
[time=2293] But also undoubtedly gripping their hearts was tremendous guilt.
[time=2297] Guilt over the fact that during that critical hour they left him,
[time=2303] abandoned in him.
[time=2307] There as they sat in that room, the Bible says Jesus came to that room.
[time=2313] How we get inside that room, Scripture, does not tell us.
[time=2316] We could speculate all morning long.
[time=2319] It would be valueless, however, but the fact of the matter is he came to that room and the Bible says he stood in their midst and he showed into them his hands and his side.
[time=2329] Indeed, they recognized that he was the risen Savior, standing in their very presence.
[time=2335] And he said unto them, "Peace beyond to you, the normal Hebrew greeting.
[time=2341] O our Lord was aware of the fear that gripped their hearts." Then the Bible says in verse 21, once again he repeats that phrase, "Peace beyond to you." Looking them in the face, he never mentions the cross.
[time=2364] Never does he rebuke them for having abandoned them or him.
[time=2370] But rather he turns to the heart of his message and he says unto them, verse 21, "As my father sent me from glory down into the world to take on human flesh
[time=2386] and to be born as a babe, that I might eventually die upon the cross of Calvary,
[time=2393] providing salvation for all mankind as he sent me into the world to complete a task
[time=2400] which I've completed. Now that all authority, both in heaven and on earth,
[time=2407] has been vested in me, I now send you out into the world
[time=2414] to communicate this message of salvation to lost mankind while it is day,
[time=2421] for the night's coming when no man is going to be able to work.
[time=2426] And so our Lord, standing in that room with these group of disciples, reiterates what he had told them previously, that he was now going to send them on a mission, for as he was going to ascend to the Father's right hand, the only band of people to be left behind was going to be a group called
[time=2447] born-again believers or Christians, and they were going to have the responsibility to take that message of salvation to lost humanity.
[time=2457] Yes, he was sending them on a mission, and my dear friends in Christ this morning,
[time=2464] we have been sent on a mission to communicate that message of salvation
[time=2470] to lost humanity, and may I share with you this morning we are doing a very poor job of executing our responsibility
[time=2482] for the world's population is increasing 32 times faster than is being evangelized.
[time=2494] Do you know ten years ago, statisticians tell us that there were only 160 cities of a million or more people living within them in the world in which we live.
[time=2507] By the year 2000, just 11 years from now, there will be over 500 cities
[time=2515] that will contain a million or more people.
[time=2520] We are further told that there are 29,500,000 non-believers moving into these cities of the world
[time=2533] every year since 1985, you want to break it down further.
[time=2538] 8,700 people who have rejected Jesus Christ as their Savior
[time=2544] never heard that glorious message of salvation are moving into these major cities of the world
[time=2550] every single day of every week of every month of every year
[time=2557] while the evangelical church is moving out of the cities at an unprecedented rate
[time=2564] leaving a huge gap behind to be filled by cults and various other world religions.
[time=2572] Yes, the truth of the matter is we are not reaching the lost with that glorious message of salvation.
[time=2581] As I mentioned earlier, our mission agencies here in North America are losing ground
[time=2588] with a great number of retirees, returning home never to go back to the field, death, sickness,
[time=2596] various other problems, we're finding a decreasing number of missionaries leaving North America
[time=2604] to carry that message of salvation to the lost, yet he has sent us on a mission.
[time=2612] The mission on which he sends, first of all, and let's underscore this in our thinking this morning,
[time=2618] he sends us to represent him, to represent him.
[time=2626] We have been sent out into the darkness where the vast majority is groping in this darkness
[time=2639] to share with them that through Christ they can have life and have it more abundantly.
[time=2646] What a wonderful privilege has been granted to us, yet what an awesome responsibility rests upon our shoulders
[time=2654] for as we walk out of this auditorium into the streets of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the surrounding communities.
[time=2663] We have the responsibility to represent him and represent him well in this darkened world.
[time=2670] For the only light these people are going to see is through your life and my life.
[time=2681] Yes, he sends us to represent him, but secondly he not only sends us to represent him,
[time=2690] but as we're on this mission sent by him, we are sent to preach or to herald him.
[time=2700] Oh, my dear friends, lifestyle is not sufficient to lead a person to a saving knowledge of Christ.
[time=2708] People have got to hear from our lips that glorious message that Jesus Christ saves
[time=2716] and has got to be echoed loudly and clearly in the ears of those who are walking in darkness, helpless, hopeless,
[time=2728] and in their present state doomed to spend all eternity separated from God.
[time=2734] Yes, we're on a mission not only to represent him, but we have got to herald his message to these lost individuals.
[time=2743] Do you realize that outside of Jesus Christ there is no living human being that carries a more important message
[time=2760] to the hearing ears of humanity than the born-again believer?
[time=2769] And that message is Jesus saves.
[time=2774] Yes, he not only sends us to represent him, he sends us to preach him, to herald him.
[time=2783] That means, my dear friends, that you might well have to cross social barriers, moral barriers,
[time=2793] geographical barriers, cultural barriers, yay, even political barriers to get the task done.
[time=2801] Think of John chapter 4, the woman at the well, you know the story well.
[time=2808] Ponder upon it our Lord knew where he was and on that mission to present to that woman the glorious message
[time=2820] that through him she could have life and have it more abundantly.
[time=2825] Our Lord as he penetrated that area was forced to cross social barriers.
[time=2832] No Jew belonged in Samaria, did they?
[time=2838] What was a Jew, namely the son of God doing talking to a prostitute, let alone a woman?
[time=2848] He had to cross moral barriers.
[time=2851] He had to cross geographical, political, and certainly cultural barriers, but none of those things deterred him
[time=2859] from communicating to that woman at the well, that message of redemption.
[time=2864] And all my dear friends, we have got to stop having this tunnel vision of the world in which we live
[time=2873] and we need to realize that God is going to call some of us out of this congregation
[time=2880] to cross moral and social and political and cultural barriers to communicate to some individual
[time=2888] whose heart has been prepared by the spirit of God, that message of salvation.
[time=2895] Yes, he's going to send us and is sending us to a herald to preach him, namely Jesus Christ,
[time=2906] the society in which we live, the world in which we live, does not need to hear of new programs
[time=2912] or new philosophies, they need to hear the person of Christ from the lips of the born again believer.
[time=2920] Yes, he sends us to represent him, to preach him, and thirdly he sends us to live him.
[time=2930] As the world looks at you and at me this morning, those of us who've placed our faith in Jesus Christ,
[time=2940] do they see as they look at us Jesus Christ being fleshed out through our lives?
[time=2949] My conduct and my character, my actions and my activities, are they those of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[time=2957] As I walk down the street in Fort Wayne, do they see a person that's uniquely different from the rest of the world?
[time=2969] Someone who's the epitome of integrity, of love, of friendship, of joy, of hope,
[time=2979] do they see that in you and in me?
[time=2982] As children of Jesus Christ, as we live him out upon planet Earth, they ought to see that in us.
[time=2994] But I am fearful that the world in which we live sees very little distinction between themselves and the born again believer.
[time=3006] And I speak that to our shame. We have been sent on a mission.
[time=3012] And as we represent Jesus Christ, they ought to see him live in and through us.
[time=3019] Whether it be in Fort Wayne or Bangladesh, the Gambia, Togo, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, Peru, Hong Kong, wherever in the world we're carrying that message.
[time=3035] They ought to see that we indeed are a child of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=3042] My dear friends, the hour is late for the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3047] The labors are fewer than they've ever been, and the task is greater than it's ever been.
[time=3054] Yet at our fingertips we have all kinds of opportunities available to us to spread that gospel through the media, etc.
[time=3067] Yet the world's population is increasing 32 times faster than it's being evangelized.
[time=3076] Let me ask you this morning, as you sit in the pew, or as up you observe this, via TV, are you where God wants you as a child of God?
[time=3090] Does He want you where you are this morning, or do you belong in some other part of the world, communicating that message of salvation?
[time=3100] You ought to be just as sure you're sitting where you're sitting because God has divinely appointed you be there as a sure as you belong in Bangladesh or some other part of the world in which we live.
[time=3113] I am fearful we do not take seriously the task that's before us.
[time=3119] The mission on which we've been sent.
[time=3122] And I wonder in our audience this morning if they're not men and women whom God has His hand upon, who have been reluctant to give up some of the things of this world in order to gain those things that will count throughout eternity.
[time=3148] We need to become a world Christian.
[time=3155] Someone has written these series of questions.
[time=3161] Listen intently and answer them, will you?
[time=3165] Do I read my Bible just for what God says to me?
[time=3171] Or to see what His purpose is for the world?
[time=3178] Do I pray only for needs?
[time=3181] Or do I also pray that the uttermost parts may be the possession of Jesus Christ?
[time=3191] Do I follow the news to see what God can use to further the cause of Christ?
[time=3198] Do I remember that?
[time=3200] Whatever my career, my true vocation is to make disciples of Jesus Christ as I go.
[time=3209] Do I remember that Christ's church embraces all of those everywhere who are in Him and for Him and seeking to walk worthy of Him?
[time=3222] Do I seek to make friends for God even of those who are unlike me?
[time=3231] Do I test my giving by remembering how sacrificially God gave His Son?
[time=3239] Do I remember that John 3, 16 also includes Albanians, Iranians, and Russians?
[time=3251] Sobering, isn't it?
[time=3255] As I am concerned with what my church spends overseas, as with what it spends on my favorite activities?
[time=3273] Provocative.
[time=3275] Do I pray that my children or my grandchildren would consider investing their lives in Christ's global cause?
[time=3287] How about at mom and dad, grandpa and grandma?
[time=3294] Do I? When I'm a little bit hungry, do I remember that tens of millions who go to bed every night are hungry?
[time=3313] Only by God's grace can I become a world Christian whose total life is committed to the global cause of Jesus Christ.
[time=3322] Jesus said, "Where I am, there will my servant be."
[time=3329] If He's going into all the world, can I lag behind?
[time=3338] Can I?
[time=3342] Yet we are.
[time=3344] Reality needs to be faced.
[time=3347] The day is far spent.
[time=3350] Young people, mom and dad, the night is soon going to be at hand.
[time=3358] The news media, etc., has clearly painted a picture for us that the end is near for the child of God.
[time=3368] I wonder this morning, are you busy about the Father's work?
[time=3375] Are you a world Christian?
[time=3377] Are you willing to go where He's going into the world?
[time=3381] Are you willing to come to the place of totally committing your life to Jesus Christ, taking your hands off of that which does not belong to you,
[time=3388] recognizing that it was He who purchased you out of the slave market of sin, and willing to come and to yield yourself totally to Him to allow Him to use you in any way He sees fit?
[time=3399] That might mean remaining in Fort Wayne.
[time=3402] That might mean selling your home, your possessions, and heading for Bangladesh, the Togo, West Africa, the Gambia.
[time=3415] Are you willing to come that place of total commitment?
[time=3419] I find across this nation there are a few Christians who are willing to come to that place of total yieldiness
[time=3426] who will surrender themselves unequivocally to Him.
[time=3429] Will you do it this morning?
[time=3433] Say, "Lord, I'm taking my hands off, and wherever you lead me, I'll go.
[time=3438] I'm surrendering myself to you.
[time=3440] Possibly you're here this morning, and you do not know Jesus Christ as your Savior.
[time=3445] My dear friend, you need to know Him.
[time=3449] And I'd like to invite you to receive Him as your very own.
[time=3455] Yes, a person without Christ is on his way to hell.
[time=3465] He needs to hear that message of redemption.
[time=3469] Jesus Christ says, "Are you willing to share it and be an obedient Christian?
[time=3477] Are you?
[time=3480] The hour's late.
[time=3482] The time is short.
[time=3484] The task is great.
[time=3489] We must work the works of Him to set us, while it is day.
[time=3498] Shall we bow our heads?" There we go.
[time=3503] Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=3523] I trust that God has used on trot to speak to your heart today.
[time=3527] And if you've never asked Christ in your heart, I'd like to encourage you to do that now.
[time=3533] I'd even like to suggest that we pray together.
[time=3536] Could I lead you?
[time=3538] Our God and Father, I sense today that I'm a sinner.
[time=3543] And I believe that Jesus is God, and that He died for my sins.
[time=3549] And I ask Him to come into my heart and to be my Lord and Savior.
[time=3554] [AMEN] If you made that prayer of commitment, we would like to help you have the assurance of your salvation.
[time=3562] And we want you to write for a booklet entitled Lessons on Assurance.
