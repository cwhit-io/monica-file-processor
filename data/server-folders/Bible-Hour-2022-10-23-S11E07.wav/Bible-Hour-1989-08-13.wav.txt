[time=114] We've made Christianity too difficult.
[time=118] Our rules are too numerous, and our responsibilities too great.
[time=124] We need to find a way of making it simpler, back to the basics, closer to Christ.
[time=130] I was reminded of that this past week as I perused a book with a fascinating title.
[time=136] It was, "Everything I really needed to know I learned in kindergarten."
[time=142] Allow me this quick quote, "Everything I really needed to know about life and how to live I learned in kindergarten."
[time=151] Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain, but there in the sand pile at Sunday school.
[time=160] We need to make our faith in Christ more basic, more real, more possible.
[time=166] More than Christ is not an adventure called mission impossible, but mission possible.
[time=175] [MUSIC]
[time=188] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=191] Thank you for joining us.
[time=193] Rick's message is entitled, "Mission Possible." Not mission impossible, but mission possible is the title of our study on the Bible Hour today.
[time=202] Too often we see following Christ as a long, arduous, impossible task.
[time=207] But if you recall, Jesus said, "Come unto me, all you that labor, and I will give you rest."
[time=213] The Lord also claimed that this burden was easy, and his yoke was light.
[time=219] Somehow we have made knowing Christ and following Christ too hard, even impossible.
[time=224] We hope that today's message will help to restore the joy in your life with Christ.
[time=228] It is not mission impossible.
[time=231] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Mark.
[time=235] Rick's text is taken from chapter 3, verse 14.
[time=239] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=245] Other special music will be provided by Lynn Rowell and Jenny Clancy.
[time=252] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=258] and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=262] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=267] Now, here's Rick.
[time=270] Welcome you friends who are here with us at Black Hawk, and also welcome our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=276] Such an encouragement to our ministry to know that we can go beyond walls.
[time=281] We can go by way of television into hospital rooms, nursing homes, prisons, into the homes of those who aren't yet interested enough in Christ to come to church, but they want a window.
[time=292] God's given us a window.
[time=294] But more than that, we have the opportunity through missionaries to go beyond the area of Fort Wayne around the world.
[time=302] I see the coals are home from Manila. Welcome back.
[time=305] It's our privilege to support them.
[time=307] Jim's here with Campus Crusade was here in the last hour.
[time=311] It's our prayer that God will take this church and make it a sending agency so that more people will be able to sing with us all hail the power of Jesus' name.
[time=337] The Jesus' name, angels, brought straight home.
[time=343] Bring forth the royal diagon and row in the row.
[time=366] Bring forth the royal diagon and row in the row in the row in the row.
[time=386] Do it all where to see us from and grow in all our own.
[time=399] Go back in number, sing with whom we at least became more.
[time=410] We'll join the ever-passing soul and bow in our own home.
[time=464] We're now in your hymnals to number 76.
[time=472] Number 76 in your hymnals, oh, four thousand tongues to sing.
[time=477] Let's sing it as though we were singing it and counting the Lord Jesus Christ as our King today with all of our voice.
[time=483] Number 76 in your hymnals.
[time=555] Thank you for your fine singing this morning. Listen now as Lin Rol comes to minister to us in song.
[time=585] Number 76 in your hymnals to sing.
[time=617] It's not a heart full of emotion.
[time=630] I need to come here before your throne.
[time=638] Worshiping your name with my life with my son.
[time=649] You are high and easy.
[time=656] You are the king of angels.
[time=670] Worthy of our praises.
[time=683] You are long, and you will reign forever long.
[time=701] Lord, the more I understand you.
[time=709] You will show me many things.
[time=716] And through your word I have assurance.
[time=723] And hope to see the things and see.
[time=729] I need to come and make a will my own.
[time=737] Worshiping your name with my life with my son.
[time=747] You are high and easy.
[time=762] You are long, and holy are worthy of our praises.
[time=776] Strong and mighty Christ alone, and you will reign forever long.
[time=794] Forever long.
[time=807] You are high and easy.
[time=815] You are the king of angels.
[time=822] You are long, and holy fathers.
[time=830] Worthy of our praises.
[time=836] Strong and mighty Christ alone, and you will reign forever long.
[time=851] And you will reign forever long.
[time=870] During this month of August at Black Hawk our emphasis is on missions.
[time=880] We have the privilege of supporting over 50 missionaries, and yet our challenge is to see more people leave Black Hawk to become ambassadors for Christ here in Fort Wayne are around the world.
[time=894] A number of years ago, as I've told you before, Kathy and I were visiting in Japan, and their pastor, Sophie Mizoguchi asked when Mary Cruz, his only missionary support was leaving, could we send him just one.
[time=908] Well, that's a theme we're trying to drive home this month that out of Black Hawk there would come one or many who would become the next generation of missionary ambassadors for Christ.
[time=919] Even though you may be watching at home, we hope that God will speak to your heart about serving Christ.
[time=925] Today's message is titled "Mission Possible." Too often we think of missions as an absolutely overwhelming, impossible task, and it's really not.
[time=935] It's simply a matter of knowing Jesus Christ and making him known. It is mission possible.
[time=942] Well, we hope you'll be with us during this month of August and allow God to challenge your heart on this important theme of missions.
[time=949] Coming up in September, we have a concert with Betty Green.
[time=953] You may remember he was with us about a year ago at this time.
[time=957] He plays the guitar, sings, and my favorite, he plays the harmonica. I never thought I'd be sitting here telling you that one of my favorite things is the harmonica, but he can play it like no one I've ever heard play it before.
[time=969] It is a fun concert, yet by the time it's all done it will be a deeply meaningful concert as well.
[time=975] That will be at seven o'clock Saturday night, September the 16th, right here on our worship center.
[time=982] We hope you'll set that night aside to join us for a concert with Buddy Green on September 16th.
[time=989] Today we want to share a booklet with you that we hope will strengthen your commitment and your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=996] As I was watching other television broadcasts early this morning, I discovered that there are those who don't believe that Jesus Christ was actually the eternal God come to earth in the form of Jesus the man
[time=1011] and that Jesus was always God and yet for those moments on earth he was also man.
[time=1018] That is what we would call to use a big word, the Orthodox view of the deity of Christ.
[time=1023] To help you understand that we've penned a book here called Jesus Christ, Our Lord.
[time=1028] It's a Bible study book that we have prepared and we'd like to share with you to help you to understand what the Bible says about our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1037] If you would like a copy of this, we would send it to you free as a gift from us to you.
[time=1042] Our address is the Bible hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, zip code 46815.
[time=1067] And while you're writing for that booklet, please write and tell us your story.
[time=1072] Have you accepted Christ as a result of one of the telecasts of the Bible hour?
[time=1077] Have you been strengthened in your faith and been turned around from a backslidden walk to a walk with Christ?
[time=1085] Have you been comforted through an hour of crises?
[time=1088] We'd like to know your story.
[time=1090] Would you take the time as a friend to write to us? It doesn't have to be fancy.
[time=1094] It certainly doesn't have to be typed. Even if you misspell the words, to be honest I won't know.
[time=1099] But I'd love to hear your story. I'll read those personally.
[time=1102] It will mean a great deal to me and to all of us here at the Bible hour.
[time=1106] So once again, our address is the Bible hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1116] Thanks for being with us today.
[time=1137] [MUSIC - 181 seconds]
[time=1322] - Thank you, Jenny.
[time=1323] The Lord Jesus said, "Whosoever would save his life would lose it." "But whosoever would lose his life for my sake and the gospels, "the same shall find it." "What shall a prophet a man "vegains the whole world and loses his soul?" "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Our God and Father, we bow before you today, reminded by Jenny's song, that we have nothing to give to you except for our life.
[time=1354] And yet our own desire is to hold on to life, to save it, to cling to it, to possess it.
[time=1362] Help us this morning to learn, to release our life and to trust you.
[time=1368] We pray this morning for those who are searchers.
[time=1371] They may be here in this place or by way of television.
[time=1375] God, we ask you to speak to their hearts.
[time=1378] We ask you to help them today, to hear the voice of your Spirit calling them to Christ.
[time=1385] We'd pray this morning that you would give encouragement of heart to those who do know you, or walking through life's valleys.
[time=1394] We'd pray this morning for Jeff Carlson as he fights an unknown pain.
[time=1399] We'd pray for Arden Marker's family as they mourn her death.
[time=1405] We ask you to encourage Tim's heart.
[time=1408] We pray that today you would give confidence to Greg Hindle and to his family as he battles leukemia.
[time=1416] We pray for each of us that today in life you would give us a sense of mission.
[time=1422] You would give us a desire to serve you.
[time=1425] Help us to know you and to serve you fully and completely,
[time=1432] in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1437] I am struck with the fact that Christianity has become far too complicated.
[time=1443] It needs to be simplified.
[time=1445] We need to get back to the basics.
[time=1448] That was driven home to me as I perused a good book this past week.
[time=1452] Not a Christian book, but still a good book.
[time=1455] It has this catchy title.
[time=1457] All I really need to know I learned in kindergarten.
[time=1462] The author makes this statement.
[time=1465] All I really need to know about life and what to do and how to live I learned in kindergarten.
[time=1471] Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain, but there at the top of the sand pile in Sunday school.
[time=1480] These are the things I learned.
[time=1482] Share everything.
[time=1484] Play fairly.
[time=1486] Don't hit people.
[time=1488] Put things back where you found them.
[time=1490] Clean up your own mess.
[time=1492] Don't take things that aren't yours.
[time=1496] Say you are sorry when you hurt somebody.
[time=1500] Wash your hands before you eat.
[time=1503] Flush.
[time=1504] Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.
[time=1508] Live a balanced life.
[time=1510] Learn some.
[time=1511] Think some.
[time=1512] Draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day, some.
[time=1518] Take a nap every afternoon.
[time=1521] When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic.
[time=1526] Hold hands.
[time=1527] Stick together.
[time=1530] Be aware of wonder.
[time=1533] Remember the little seed that you put in a styrofoam cup and the roots grew down and the plant grew up and none of us knew how or why, but we're all like that.
[time=1545] Goldfish, and hamsters, and white mice, and the little seed in the styrofoam cup, they all die.
[time=1555] And so do we.
[time=1558] It's basic, isn't it?
[time=1560] It is simple.
[time=1562] And the Lord Jesus Christ wants to have a personal relationship with us, and it's so basic.
[time=1568] It's so simple.
[time=1569] Somehow in Christianity we have complicated it with our rules that are so numerous.
[time=1574] We have burned it with our traditions that are multitudinous, and we forget what our mission is.
[time=1582] Some of you like me, you grew up in the 60s, and you remember this line.
[time=1588] Your mission.
[time=1589] Should you decide to accept it is.
[time=1592] Do you remember the strike of that match?
[time=1594] Do you remember Mr. Phelps?
[time=1595] Isn't it great that some old things come back like mission impossible?
[time=1599] Well, what would happen today if God was to say to us he has a mission impossible for us?
[time=1606] What if God said your mission?
[time=1609] Should you decide to accept it?
[time=1615] Hello, Rick.
[time=1616] Your mission should you decide to accept it is to know Jesus Christ.
[time=1621] Rick, I need you to not only know my son.
[time=1624] I want you to study him and live with him so that you'll think like him, talk like him, and act like him.
[time=1631] Your mission is to be able to reflect Christ so perfectly that you'll be able to pass yourself off as him in every situation.
[time=1639] No one, acquaintance or closest friend, must be able to detect the slightest discrepancy between you and him.
[time=1646] You must duplicate him perfectly.
[time=1648] Most of all, Rick, you must carry out your mission with total sincerity.
[time=1652] If it is not real, the mission is blown.
[time=1655] Now, Rick, here is the hard part of your mission.
[time=1658] You must not only know my son, but you must also make him known.
[time=1663] Unfortunately, our side is overused.
[time=1666] The traditional hit them with the sermon or pass out a tracked and run method.
[time=1671] If your mission is to be successful, you must invest your life with people.
[time=1676] Our team is going to have to infiltrate offices, shops and neighborhoods.
[time=1680] Consistency and integrity are essential.
[time=1683] Fortunately, you have a lot with which to work.
[time=1685] My spirit will help you, and my word will guide you.
[time=1689] Good luck, Rick.
[time=1690] Remember, should you or any of your team fail or be captured?
[time=1694] I will acknowledge you, and I will never leave you or forsake you.
[time=1698] This tape will self-destruct in five seconds.
[time=1703] Thank you, Scott.
[time=1706] Jim Schweicher recorded that for us.
[time=1709] Mission Impossible.
[time=1711] What if God gave you an impossible mission today?
[time=1714] What would it be?
[time=1716] I think we can find it in Matthew.
[time=1718] Excuse me, Mark chapter 3 verse 14.
[time=1722] This gives us the account of Jesus choosing his original 12 disciples or apostles as they're often called.
[time=1731] It gives to us our mission in life, but it's not a mission impossible,
[time=1737] but rather a mission possible.
[time=1740] Mark 3 verse 14.
[time=1745] He appointed 12, designating them apostles that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach.
[time=1757] Simple, clear statement of why Christ chose his original disciples.
[time=1764] What was their mission?
[time=1766] It's important that we know because it is ours.
[time=1769] Because we are simply carrying the baton, relaying the same message that Christ gave to them.
[time=1777] Their mission in ours is this, to know Jesus Christ and to make him known.
[time=1784] Two phases, phase one, he chose them with this purpose, so that they might be with him and phase two,
[time=1795] so that he might send them forth.
[time=1798] Look first at phase one, Jesus chose his disciples so that they might be with him.
[time=1806] His very purpose for selecting Peter and Andrew, two brothers, James and John, two other brothers,
[time=1813] and Nathaniel and Bartholomew, and another Simon, another guy named Judas Iscariot, all total 12.
[time=1823] He chose them so that they might be with him.
[time=1829] And that is the very reason why God has made us so that we could know him, so that we could be with him.
[time=1839] Throughout the centuries, mankind has wrestled with the question in life, why am I here?
[time=1848] Did you ever stop and think this morning, why are you here?
[time=1852] Oh, I don't mean that your wife made you come.
[time=1854] Are they going to have dinner unless you came, no one would be happy, so they drug you to turn.
[time=1859] Not why are you in this building, but why are you here?
[time=1863] Why do you exist?
[time=1865] The pre-Socratic philosophers used to debate.
[time=1868] Some would say that the reality is our being, and this is all there is, and the real world is the world that you see.
[time=1876] Others said that there was an ideal, and that life was simply an attempt to find the ideal and to live up to that ideal.
[time=1887] The question of life, what gives it its meaning?
[time=1893] Shakespeare put these words in the mouth of Hamlet, the melancholy dame,
[time=1900] to be or not to be, that is the question.
[time=1907] Again, the timeless wrestling, what is life's meaning, is life meaningful, or if I just died, if I took my own life?
[time=1918] That give meaning, to be or to not to be.
[time=1924] In the late '60s, rock music turned folk, began to ask questions.
[time=1931] Chicago had an album, and on it they had questions 67 and 68.
[time=1937] I don't know what questions 1 through 66 were, but questions 67 and 68 said,
[time=1943] "I want to know whether life has meaning." Then they asked the question, "I've been searching so long to find out the answer to the question, who am I?"
[time=1953] The know of my life has meaning.
[time=1956] The folk singer sang, "What is it all about, Alfie?" And in the late '70s, Pink Floyd gave an answer.
[time=1964] It's about nothing.
[time=1965] All in all, you're just another brick in the wall.
[time=1975] All of us are in a search.
[time=1977] For life's purpose, what is our mission?
[time=1982] What is it that we are made for?
[time=1986] Our mission, the reason we exist, we were made to know God.
[time=1993] In the Old Testament, if I can give you somewhat of a panoramic view of Scripture, it tells us this.
[time=1998] It tells us that we're gods, that we belong to Him, and that is our mission.
[time=2003] Psalm 100, one of the shorter Psalms says, "Know that the Lord is God.
[time=2009] It is He who made us.
[time=2011] We are His.
[time=2013] We are His people, the sheep of His pasture." Enter His gates with thanksgiving.
[time=2019] Enter His courts with praise.
[time=2021] Give thanks to Him and praise His name.
[time=2024] Why are you here?
[time=2026] God said, "I've made you, and I've made you for myself." You're to know me.
[time=2033] You're to praise me.
[time=2035] Isaiah 43, 7, echoes that theme.
[time=2039] Everyone who is called by my name, whom I created, for my glory,
[time=2046] whom I formed and made.
[time=2049] God says He has made us, and He has made us to know Him and to glorify Him.
[time=2056] Verse 18 of Isaiah 43, "The former things are to be forgotten.
[time=2062] Do not dwell on the past.
[time=2065] See, I'm doing a new thing.
[time=2067] Now it springs up.
[time=2069] Do you not perceive it?
[time=2072] I am making a way in a desert and streams in the wasteland.
[time=2077] The wild jackals honor me, the wild animals in the owls, because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland
[time=2088] to give drink to my people and my chosen.
[time=2092] The people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
[time=2100] God has created us to know Him and to glorify Him and serve Him.
[time=2109] The Westminster Confession, a good old statement out of the Reformation says that the chief duty of man is to know God and to enjoy Him forever.
[time=2122] Augustine said our hearts are restless, O God, until we find our rest in the Pascal,
[time=2131] I believe it is, who said that there is a God-shaped vacuum inside of each of us
[time=2138] that He alone can fill.
[time=2140] We can fill it with a relationship, and suddenly that relationship will blossom and give life meaning, and then suddenly we realize that there is still a dimension to life
[time=2150] that is missing.
[time=2152] The Spirit is hungry.
[time=2154] We fill it with success, and success comes and it fills that spot,
[time=2160] and again there is this outburst of joy and a sense of meaning, but it like the scorching sun on a flower, withers and fades,
[time=2172] and there is still the emptiness until we know Jesus Christ,
[time=2179] for He has made us for Himself, and He alone can come and quench the thirsting of our soul.
[time=2188] Our job is to know Christ, to be so in the Word, so drawing close to Him that we are with Him
[time=2199] to the point that we become like Him.
[time=2202] It is like in football or drama, an understudy.
[time=2207] The person who watches the starting quarterback and learns the plays, see which receivers cut where best, like the understudy,
[time=2218] and a traveling drama who is so adept at the master's lines,
[time=2224] he can say them on a moment's notice.
[time=2228] For some time, Kathy had planned a special trip for the two of us with some friends to see the great Les Misérables as a musical.
[time=2236] We looked forward to it. We had heard the soundtrack.
[time=2239] We had listened to the tape and marveled at this man's tender voice that could sing so crisp and so clear, and at the end of that great song, "Bring Him Home," and he hits a high note just perfectly.
[time=2252] We sat through Les Misérables, and we enjoyed every part of it, and we waited for "Bring Him Home," and Elbows were being nudged down the line as we waited to hear this song, and he sung it perfectly.
[time=2265] And he hit that last note precisely. He didn't slide or slur.
[time=2270] It was there on that high note.
[time=2274] And we just said, "Ah, He is great." We sat there, and we read the credits of all the other musicals he had been in, and all the great people had performed before, and when it was all over, we snuck backstage, and we got his autograph, and he wasn't him.
[time=2288] It was an understudy, and he didn't miss a line.
[time=2292] He didn't miss a note. He was flawless.
[time=2297] And we are to know Jesus Christ so that if people never heard of Jesus Christ
[time=2303] and found Him in the Scripture, they'd say, "I've already met Him." He's that guy that cuts hair down the street.
[time=2311] He's the one that fixes my car at the Georgetown Service Station.
[time=2316] That's my boss. I work for him.
[time=2319] We are to so know Jesus Christ that we are His understudy, that we think like He thinks.
[time=2326] We talk like He talks, and we act like He acts.
[time=2332] That's phase one of our mission, to know Him that thoroughly.
[time=2338] For 30 years, Hal Holbrook has been doing Mark Twain tonight.
[time=2343] It takes him over six hours to put on his makeup.
[time=2347] And after two hours with Hal Holbrook, you would have thought that you had spent two hours with Mark Twain.
[time=2355] If Mark Twain came back to life, he'd have a hard time living up to Mark Twain.
[time=2360] Hal Holbrook does it that well.
[time=2363] How well do we do?
[time=2365] Not an impersonation, but an actual God-shaped replica of Jesus Christ.
[time=2373] That's our job to know Him that well.
[time=2377] Paul said that his lifelong quest was this, Philippians 3, 10.
[time=2384] "I want to know Him, and the power of His resurrection,
[time=2390] and also the fellowship of His suffering, being made like Him, even in His death.
[time=2399] And so, somehow obtained to the resurrection from the dead.
[time=2403] Not that I've already obtained all this, or I've already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold
[time=2413] of me.
[time=2415] Brothers, I do not count myself to have achieved all this.
[time=2421] No.
[time=2423] But one thing I do, forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,
[time=2430] I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God called me
[time=2436] heavenwardly in Christ Jesus.
[time=2439] Paul, the call, your mission, should you decide to accept it,
[time=2445] is to know Jesus Christ, holy and fully."
[time=2451] Phase two of our mission is found in this phrase.
[time=2455] He appointed twelve, designating them apostles that they might be with him
[time=2461] and that he might send them forth to preach.
[time=2466] Most of us, when we hear the second part of our mission, that God only wants us to know him, but then he wants us to be sent out.
[time=2474] That's his purpose for having us with him, is that it's a one-on-one training time so that he can send us out.
[time=2482] But we hear that send forth to preach, we often get cold feet.
[time=2486] There are some misunderstandings.
[time=2488] Misunderstanding number one is this.
[time=2491] We often view the twelve disciples as the superheroes of the first century.
[time=2497] I mean weren't they the Batman and Robin, Superman and Wonder Woman of their era?
[time=2502] I mean we could never be like these guys, they were extraordinary.
[time=2507] Really not so.
[time=2509] In fact, they were common at best.
[time=2513] There was Simon, who Jesus renamed Peter, he was a fisherman.
[time=2519] He had a brother named Andrew.
[time=2522] James and a brother by the name of John likewise made fishing their occupation.
[time=2528] Philip, Bartholomew, who was called Nathaniel, wasn't overly impressed with Jesus.
[time=2534] On the first account he said, "Jesus from Nazareth? Big deal."
[time=2540] Nothing good ever comes out of Nazareth.
[time=2543] Matthew.
[time=2545] Matthew, a local hero, hardly.
[time=2549] He was a tax collector.
[time=2551] He was the Benedict Arnold of his day.
[time=2553] The Romans came in, dominated the land and then there were always a few turncoats.
[time=2558] Matthew was one of those.
[time=2559] He sold out to the Romans.
[time=2561] He extracted taxes for the Romans from his own countrymen.
[time=2566] Hardly local hero.
[time=2569] Thomas was never sure what the right track was.
[time=2573] Jesus said, "You know the way." Thomas said, "I don't know the way." Jesus said, "You know where I'm going." He said, "Where?" Jesus said, "Here I am." Thomas wasn't there and when he heard the story he said, "I'll never believe that." It seems believing.
[time=2590] Hardly hero material.
[time=2592] Another James, a Thaddeus, a Simon who was called a zealot.
[time=2597] He was at the opposite end of the spectrum from Matthew.
[time=2601] Matthew sold out to the Romans.
[time=2603] Simon was trying to kill him.
[time=2605] He was a radical insurrectionist.
[time=2608] He was the contra of his day.
[time=2612] Jesus was somehow able to take both sides and bring them together with a new mission.
[time=2618] There was Judas, a scariot, who later betrayed him.
[time=2622] Twelve common men, not superheroes.
[time=2626] Not necessarily what you would call the right stuff.
[time=2630] Twelve common men.
[time=2632] Here's what William Barkley, New Testament historian, has to say about him.
[time=2636] Judging them by worldly standards, the men Jesus chose had no special qualifications at all.
[time=2646] They were not wealthy.
[time=2648] They had no social position.
[time=2650] They had no education.
[time=2652] They were not trained theologians.
[time=2655] They were not high-ranking churchmen.
[time=2658] They were twelve ordinary men.
[time=2662] But they had two special qualifications.
[time=2665] First, they had felt the magnetic attraction of Jesus.
[time=2669] There was something about him that made them wish to take him as their master.
[time=2675] And second, they had the courage to show that they were on his side.
[time=2683] Ordinary people. God uses ordinary people.
[time=2689] People like you.
[time=2691] People like me.
[time=2693] Abraham Lincoln put it this way.
[time=2695] God loves the common man.
[time=2697] That's why he made so many of us.
[time=2701] God's not looking for extraordinarily gifted people.
[time=2704] He's not looking for those who have achieved great success by this world's standards because when they become spokesman, are women for Christ, everyone is enamored with their secular success
[time=2715] and misses the message.
[time=2717] When God takes an ordinary person, he makes of them an ambassador for eternity.
[time=2723] Mistake number one is to think that being sent forth to preach means you have to be extraordinary.
[time=2729] Actually, it helps if you're ordinary.
[time=2732] Mistake number two is what I call "He'll send me to Africa syndrome." Most of us fear that if we get too close to God, he's going to send me to Africa where the mosquitoes are thicker than the air.
[time=2745] And if the lions don't eat you, the people will.
[time=2748] But most of us have a greater fear than God sending us to Africa.
[time=2752] We're afraid he'll send us to Fort Wayne.
[time=2754] Wouldn't that be worse?
[time=2756] I mean, what if God expected you to speak boldly in Jesus' name right here?
[time=2761] I mean, where people knew you, where you had to face him the next day, where you didn't get a plane home.
[time=2768] Here are the fears most of us have.
[time=2771] One of the fears is that God's going to make us carry a Bible everywhere we go.
[time=2776] Not a pocket New Testament.
[time=2779] Giant family Bible.
[time=2781] One that says, "Holy Bible on the front of it." Isn't that a fear that we have?
[time=2787] You know, you get too close to God, he's going to take over your life, he's going to make a religious fanatic out of you, and you've got to wear your religion like Barney Fife wears his revolver.
[time=2800] One of my fears when I came to Christ in high school is that Jesus was going to make me jump up on the lunch table when the cafeteria was crowded and start yelling, "Repant!"
[time=2813] You don't want to say that.
[time=2816] You may be the one who is afraid that God is going to make you embarrass yourself.
[time=2825] And you don't want to do that.
[time=2828] And you'll never ask you to do that.
[time=2832] Jesus Christ will never say, "I'm going to embarrass you.
[time=2835] I'm going to make a spectacle out of you.
[time=2837] I'm going to make a mockery out of you." In fact, the things that we often associate with that whole mentality aren't productive for Christ either.
[time=2848] What Jesus wants is your heart.
[time=2851] And when he takes over your heart, all things start changing in a quick way.
[time=2856] He doesn't want to embarrass you.
[time=2859] Here's what he says in Jeremiah chapter 29, verse 11.
[time=2865] "I know the plans that I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." God says, "I want you to follow me.
[time=2880] You may know hardship and you may know persecution, but ultimately my plans are for good." Psalm 37.4, in many ways, has been a life-shaping verse for me.
[time=2895] In it, David talks about some of his fears and his frustrations, and then he comes out with this statement.
[time=2902] "Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart."
[time=2908] Let me begin by telling you what that verse does not mean.
[time=2912] That verse does not mean, "Okay, I've got to delight myself in God." How do I do that? Well, let's have a campfire.
[time=2918] Let's sing 13 verses of Kumbaya.
[time=2920] Let's get a warm, fuzzy feeling.
[time=2922] "Okay, I'm delighting in God now. Now what is it I want?" Well, I'd really like a silver Rolls-Royce.
[time=2928] Well, I'm delighted in God. God, my desire is a silver Rolls-Royce.
[time=2932] Would one of the ushers go on and see if God's delivered it out back yet?
[time=2936] Not at all what the verse means.
[time=2938] When it says, "Delight ourselves in the Lord," it means this, "to make my first love, the Lord Jesus Christ, to make my first priority, knowing him and serving him.
[time=2948] And when I know him, instead of him giving me what I've always wanted,
[time=2955] he changes my wants. So my heart's desire now is his desire.
[time=2964] He takes the old desires and slowly moves them aside and slowly moves in a new desire.
[time=2971] And the more I delight in him, the more I delight to do as well.
[time=2976] God's formula for change is internal to external, not external to internal.
[time=2985] He changes hearts.
[time=2987] There is a book called "The Children of Frankenstein." I have not read it. I steal this quote from another author.
[time=2994] In America today, the popular word for the good life is happiness.
[time=3000] The American pursuit of happiness can often look like a compulsive, joyless effort to escape boredom.
[time=3007] A people blessed with far more material advantages than any other society has ever enjoyed
[time=3013] is clearly not the happiest people on earth.
[time=3018] One plain reason is a concept of the good life
[time=3024] or what I have called the highest standard of low living in all history.
[time=3030] But this only forces the basic question, what then is the good life?
[time=3038] I want to suggest to you that the good life is the mission that God has for us.
[time=3043] It is to know him and to make him known.
[time=3048] And if we will fall in love with him and make the pursuit of our life to please him,
[time=3055] he says that he will give us joy, he will give us fulfillment.
[time=3060] He will take even our enemies and make them to be at peace with us.
[time=3066] I have to warn you, God may want to send you to Africa.
[time=3073] But he won't do that one day before he puts the desire in your heart to want to go to Africa.
[time=3086] Mistake number three or misunderstanding number three is this.
[time=3090] Preaching can only be done at church on Sundays by men in dark suits who also speak when people die.
[time=3101] To be sure, the word preach has a very historical context.
[time=3105] It is that which I am doing to you right now.
[time=3110] But when Jesus sent them out, the word preach, Caruso, doesn't have a uniquely religious meaning.
[time=3116] It simply means the talent.
[time=3119] Some of the best places you can tell it are places outside of church.
[time=3124] In fact, church is one of the worst places to try to tell it because the only people who come to church are the people who have already been told it.
[time=3133] And we need to tell it where the people are who haven't been told it yet.
[time=3138] We need to go underground in cognito behind enemy lines.
[time=3147] And there spring up where the message that Jesus loves you.
[time=3152] We need to share it and we need to live it.
[time=3155] Let me give you three illustrations.
[time=3157] Illustration number one is by a man who makes his living cutting and styling hair.
[time=3163] He is gracious. He is bold.
[time=3166] He has balanced the two quite well.
[time=3169] A lady was getting her hair cut and she began to talk.
[time=3174] Ever notice how you feel like talking when people put sharp scissors to your head?
[time=3179] She began to say how her life was not gone well.
[time=3184] She was kind of searching but she didn't know for what.
[time=3188] His ears lit up. His spirit was prepared.
[time=3192] They began to tell how he came to Christ.
[time=3195] She interrupted him and said this is really strange.
[time=3198] I don't pray much but I prayed this morning that God would bring somebody into my life who would tell me about him.
[time=3209] She looked at him and said you know, maybe you want to change and become a priest.
[time=3214] He said if I was a priest would you have listened?
[time=3218] No? She responded? I probably wouldn't have.
[time=3224] Illustration number two.
[time=3227] This is from Charles Colson's book Loving God.
[time=3230] The chapter called Contra Mundum. It means Against the World.
[time=3234] Not that it's us and them.
[time=3237] We're going to stand over here and launch our spiritual hand grenades, not at all.
[time=3242] By Contra Mundum, Colson means that we live an ethic different than the world.
[time=3248] We have a compassion that's different than the world.
[time=3251] He tells the story about a judge in Elkhart, Indiana, by the name of Bill Bondtrager.
[time=3256] He was tough. He was stern.
[time=3260] But this man, Fred Palmer, who stood in front of him, was obviously a man well on his way to Reformation.
[time=3267] The man who judged Bondtrager was convinced that would not be helped would be hindered by prison.
[time=3273] The law demanded a minimum ten-year sentence.
[time=3277] Bondtrager declared the Indiana law unconstitutional as cruel and unusual sentenced him but to one year.
[time=3285] Fred Palmer had come to Christ. His life was changed.
[time=3291] He served out his year and he was released.
[time=3294] Years later, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that Judge Bondtrager had broken the law
[time=3301] and forced him to sentence Fred Palmer to nine remaining years.
[time=3307] Bondtrager said no and was found in contempt of court.
[time=3311] Palmer turned himself in. He went in to serve his nine years.
[time=3318] Here's what Fred Palmer said. Sometimes in prison, people would say to me,
[time=3324] "If God so good, why did he send you back to prison?"
[time=3330] And I would tell them, "God didn't send me back here.
[time=3335] He allowed men to send me back here so I could tell people like you about Jesus Christ."
[time=3346] Fred Palmer had an audience that neither you or I could ever have.
[time=3351] Like Joseph, God allowed men's plans for evil to become the fulfillment of what God planned for good.
[time=3359] He was one of the great preachers of that day. Fred Palmer, the convict, the prisoner, a third illustration.
[time=3369] An eight-year-old little girl was at athletic practice.
[time=3372] She hears another eight-year-old little girl say something that she shouldn't say.
[time=3377] The first said to the second, "You know we shouldn't do that." It makes Jesus sad when we do, and spoken like an eight-year-old.
[time=3386] The other girl was puzzled, didn't understand, and an eight-year-old told another eight-year-old about Jesus
[time=3393] how he loved her, how he died for her sins, and how she needed to give her life to him.
[time=3400] The other eight-year-old asked how, and they prayed together at swim practice.
[time=3406] That eight-year-old probably would have looked at a stern 36-year-old preacher who said, "Don't swear you little rug rat," and then turned off to God for another decade.
[time=3416] But an eight-year-old can tell the story to an eight-year-old.
[time=3420] That's preaching. That's telling. That's declaring.
[time=3426] That's our mission to know him and to make him known.
[time=3433] That's why God created you. That's why he has created me.
[time=3440] That's why Jesus Christ died on the cross so that we could know him, so that we could make him known.
[time=3449] One of the best things that could happen is one of the worst things that could happen.
[time=3453] It would be one of the best things if one of you said, "Pastor Sosie Misoguchi, I will come to Kofu, Japan."
[time=3460] It'd be the best thing if some of you would say, "I would go to unevangelized fields and tell about Christ."
[time=3466] But that would be the worst thing if God wants you to tell the story right where you are,
[time=3473] in your cul-de-sac, in your shop, at your office, to your aunt, your grandparents, your uncle.
[time=3484] Your mission should you decide to accept it is to know Jesus Christ and to make him known.
[time=3514] Today we have been speaking about knowing Christ. If you don't know Christ, may I suggest that you invite him into your heart right now?
[time=3542] I'd like to suggest that you pray a prayer with me.
[time=3547] Our Father, I believe today that Jesus is your Son, that He is God, that He died on the cross for my sins.
[time=3557] I want to know Him, and I ask Jesus to come into my life and to be my Savior and my Lord, amen.
