[time=30] I said love, love, love.
[time=60] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=110] If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, you don't have a choice whether you'll be a witness for him or not.
[time=119] For Jesus said of all of his disciples, "You shall be my witnesses."
[time=126] The only choice we have is whether we'll be a good witness or a bad one.
[time=132] [MUSIC]
[time=146] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=152] Rick's message today is entitled "Me, a Missionary." Being a witness for Christ carries some heavy connotations, some good, some others bad.
[time=162] Many of us picture an overzealous fanatic at the airport pushing flowers or literature and seeking a donation.
[time=169] At other times, we envision a select few talented communicators speaking to thousands at an overflowing football stadium on Primetime National TV.
[time=179] Somehow, we cannot picture ourselves being either one of these. Yet Jesus said, "You will be my witnesses."
[time=187] In today's message, Rick will talk about how each of us can be effective and appropriate witnesses for Christ.
[time=194] Join us as Rick addresses the question, "Me, a Missionary."
[time=200] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song. We will also be hearing from Brian Losen
[time=209] and Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe.
[time=213] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=221] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=227] Now here's Rick.
[time=228] We do want to welcome you to Black Hawk. We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=234] Our purpose today is for those of us who know Christ to worship Him and to grow in our insight as to who He is, what His plan is for our life.
[time=245] Our purpose for those who don't know Christ is to have an open atmosphere for searchers and seekers who can come and examine.
[time=252] So if you slipped in today, and this is all new to you, I hope you feel just as welcome as those who helped start this church some 20 years ago.
[time=260] We love God. We've come to declare His greatness and our choir leads us in an anthem. He is Jehovah.
[time=278] He is Jehovah. God of creation. He is Jehovah. God of the high sea, the love of dear the air, the love of angels.
[time=293] He is Jehovah, the love that He would be.
[time=300] He is the great I am, the God of Abraham and Jehovah's child, the God of this I am, the God of Israel, the everlasting one.
[time=314] He is Jehovah. God of the high sea, the love that He would be.
[time=364] He is Jehovah. He is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, the love that He would be.
[time=402] He is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, he is Jehovah. God of the high sea, the love that He would be.
[time=420] [APPLAUSE]
[time=426] There are passages in the scripture, numerous passages that speak of the names of Jesus. Jesus and the names of God our Heavenly Father.
[time=436] We're going to continue praising the name of the Lord today as we sing number 8. Him number 8 will sing verses 1, 2, and 4 together.
[time=445] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=570] Thank you very much for your good singing. We really appreciate it when you sing out and join with us in this avenue of praise to the Lord.
[time=578] Last week we had the privilege of being up in Michigan and a church that I grew up in and another church that my father started a number of years ago, 25 years ago in fact.
[time=588] I have to admit that the music wasn't very good, the preaching was great. Of course I have to say that I was the singer and my dad was the pastor preaching.
[time=598] So we appreciated having the privilege of leaving Fort Wayne for just one week and going up with my dad to the churches that he formally pastored.
[time=608] But it's great to be home and we do appreciate Blackhawk Baptist Church and all of you people and all of the singers that work so hard to minister to you through music.
[time=618] This morning is no exception as the choir sang and we're grateful for their enthusiasm throughout the summer and you're welcome to join us come September if you're interested in singing in the choir.
[time=628] We're going to continue with music now as Brian Lowson comes to sing for us a song entitled "The Rock of Fate is Jesus."
[time=658] And when we are in danger we run to him and find the grace that keeps our spirits, the peace that guards our minds, raise the rock, raise the mighty rock.
[time=678] The rock of faith is Jesus and in this rock we hide, he draws us to his presence, he calls us to abide, and from the rock of refuge the eyes of faith behold, the glory of the Father that Christ the Son unfolds.
[time=699] Raise the rock, raise the mighty rock.
[time=708] The rock of faith is Jesus and in this rock we build, a resting place for others, a temple to be filled.
[time=729] With those who need his comfort, with those who thirst for him, the love that God has shown us through us he shows through them.
[time=757] The rock of faith is Jesus, let all his people sing, for our great rock of refuge is also our great name, he bends in love to serve us, he keeps us in his ways.
[time=774] We know the love of Jesus, let Jesus know our praise, let him know our praise, the rock of faith is Jesus, let Jesus know
[time=802] our praise, let him know our praise.
[time=818] Again we want to welcome you to the Bible hour, I hope that you've already been encouraged of heart and your faith in Jesus Christ has been strengthened.
[time=827] Peter we missed you last week but I understand you had a great time serving the Lord with your Father.
[time=832] Well Rick we really did, we were in southern California, he's from California, southern Michigan where he started a couple of churches several years ago and it was really nice to be back in the home area and greet the people that are still there from years ago.
[time=847] And this was the 25th anniversary of a church your father had started, he began a church in South Haven Michigan, Bethel Baptist Church 25 years ago and was the pastor in a church about 20 miles south of there for 13 years, so it was a nice reunion.
[time=862] And he preached and you led the music, is that how it went?
[time=865] Yep I did everything but take the offering, I can show you how to do that, well we missed you and are glad that your back Ron did a fine job but it's good to have you home.
[time=876] Good to have you joining us today, we'd love to meet you face to face and invite you to an upcoming concert that will be a delightful Saturday night with Buddy Green.
[time=886] Well Rick you know Buddy Green is a great harmonica player and that sounds very unusual for those of you that have never seen him but he really does play it very well as a great personality and a great heart for the Lord.
[time=898] You'll hear variety on that harmonica, I'll assure you. We were just talking a moment ago, the thing that all of us remember from Buddy Green is when he played the William Tell Overture for those of you of my generation, that's the theme song from the Lone Ranger and it just sounds like an orchestra, not a one man harmonica.
[time=915] He really plays and we would like to invite you to come on Saturday evening, September 16th, it's right here in the worship center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and we'd like to invite you to come, it's at seven o'clock, it's a ticketed concert, you can pick up tickets at the door or you can call here at the church at 4937400.
[time=936] Along with playing it in a very classical fashion he can make it sound like a good old Jewish bar mitzvah or a country jamboree or some quiet melodious worshipful devotional song, it's downright exciting but before the evening's over it will have been a very meaningful time as well.
[time=957] We hope you can come September the 16th at seven o'clock, also today we want to encourage you to write for a booklet that we've put together here at Black Hawk, we call the booklet Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=970] It's a four lesson Bible study that digs deeply into the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=977] We talk about things like the Passover plot, the view that Jesus didn't die on the cross, that he swooned, that he came very near death but then was resuscitated and presented as though he had died and was now alive, no resurrection, no miracle, no deity, not God, just a fantastic, contrived plot.
[time=1001] We look at that and then we look at the evidence as to what the Bible presents for the resurrection and find it very convincing that Jesus not only died but he did rise again to prove that he was God.
[time=1014] Well that's just one of the four lessons we have for you in this booklet that we hope you'll write for and read and grow by.
[time=1022] We encourage you to write today for this helpful booklet, you can write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1034] That's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1043] Thank you Peter, you may notice that during this month of August we have a particular emphasis on missions.
[time=1050] Our church is committed to not only sharing Jesus Christ here in Fort Wayne or by extension to you friends who watch by way of television but in a global way.
[time=1059] So we support over 50 missionaries that are on just about every continent in various countries doing everything from nursing and doctoring to broadcasting and preaching and church planning and hospital work.
[time=1072] We want to share the Lord Jesus Christ and if you're not a believer in Christ we want to share with you this morning that he loves you and that he cares for you.
[time=1081] If you are a believer in Christ we want you to know that you are God's ambassador, you are his witness, you are his missionary.
[time=1089] Christ said to each of us, you are my witnesses.
[time=1093] We hope that today's service will strengthen you who know Christ in your commitment to share him in a gracious way yet in a bold way.
[time=1101] Thanks for joining us today.
[time=1131] To cast a light, the tithes to turn again.
[time=1136] You are, you are.
[time=1141] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1146] Never failing, or end unchanging God, eternal Savior.
[time=1155] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1159] Never wavering, guide, unending source, ageless Creator.
[time=1167] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1190] You are, you are more certain than the things we see and then our feelings seem to fade.
[time=1203] You are, you are.
[time=1209] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1214] Never failing, end unchanging God, eternal Savior.
[time=1223] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1228] Never wavering, guide, unending source, ageless Creator.
[time=1235] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1240] As you have always been, so you will always be the living world.
[time=1249] The silent God who holds our hearts in perfect peace.
[time=1258] So you are faithful, Lord.
[time=1263] Never failing, or end unchanging God.
[time=1268] Eternal Savior.
[time=1272] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1277] Never wavering, guide, unending source, ageless Creator.
[time=1285] You are faithful, Lord.
[time=1314] Thank you, Kevin and Denise.
[time=1316] And God, we thank you that you are faithful, Lord.
[time=1320] We pray that even a song with such enthusiasm could take hearts that may have been discouraged
[time=1327] and revitalize them with a sense of encouragement.
[time=1331] Thank you for the ministry that music does have.
[time=1335] It calms our hearts and it invigorates our spirits and appoints us to you.
[time=1343] We've come today to worship you and to praise you.
[time=1347] We thank you that today there is confidence in life.
[time=1351] That the rock of our faith is Jesus and we stand today on Him.
[time=1356] Thank you that we can know today of sin's forgiveness.
[time=1361] Thank you that we can know today of being made acceptable before you.
[time=1366] Thank you that you have called us your own children.
[time=1370] You are faithful and we worship you and we praise you.
[time=1374] We ask you to meet with us.
[time=1377] God, we ask you to speak to hearts at every stop point in life.
[time=1382] Thank you for those today who are soaring.
[time=1385] They are literally flying on a week of success.
[time=1389] Help them today to enjoy the fruit of their labor.
[time=1393] Help them today to savor the taste of success.
[time=1398] Help us today in our successes to recognize that it is your hand that has given us everything.
[time=1404] And we stop to thank you.
[time=1407] We pray for those who are discouraged and defeated.
[time=1410] For those who are unemployed or underemployed.
[time=1414] That you would give their life a sense of dignity.
[time=1418] That you would provide for them work fitting for their skill and their preparation.
[time=1424] We pray for those who have ensnared their own lives.
[time=1429] They've been caught by their own words or their own habits.
[time=1433] God, it's easy for us to point a finger and say it's all your own fault.
[time=1438] But we are only different than they by your grace.
[time=1443] The lowest of low is our location if you did not spare us of the consequences of our own sin.
[time=1450] And so with compassion we pray for those who have become enslaved to habits.
[time=1456] To the habit of anger.
[time=1459] Or to the habit of alcohol.
[time=1462] Or to the sensation of cocaine.
[time=1465] God, they will need intervention.
[time=1468] And we ask you to intervene.
[time=1471] We pray for those facing the hard times in life.
[time=1474] Particularly for Kevin Souther and his family.
[time=1478] For Scott's mother that she would recover.
[time=1481] We pray for the Hindus that you would encourage them.
[time=1484] And thank you for Greg's strength of spirit.
[time=1487] And is being able to be home from the hospital and active again.
[time=1492] And now as we open your word we ask you to make of us your ambassadors.
[time=1497] Your witnesses in Jesus name, amen.
[time=1504] This is a month at Blackhawk where we are emphasizing missions.
[time=1509] I don't want to take for granted this morning that everyone here knows what we mean when we say missions.
[time=1516] In church language and we are often guilty of having our own vocabulary and cliches.
[time=1522] Missions means the opportunity for those of us who know Jesus Christ.
[time=1529] To leave the security of this place that we call home.
[time=1533] That we call church.
[time=1535] And to venture out.
[time=1536] Maybe into a new ministry in this community.
[time=1539] Or maybe to Peru with Wycliffe Bible translators.
[time=1543] To take God's word and pen it in a new vocabulary.
[time=1548] So another world can hear about Christ.
[time=1551] Or maybe it's going to Manila.
[time=1553] One of the fastest growing cities in the world where over 15,000 people live in the city dump.
[time=1560] And to share with them Jesus Christ's love.
[time=1563] Or maybe it's staying right here in Fort Wayne and becoming active in a crisis pregnancy center with Christian businessmen.
[time=1571] But missions is those of us who know Christ.
[time=1575] Having a sense of God appointedness to sharing Christ with those who don't know Him.
[time=1583] But most of the time for those of us who have been around church.
[time=1587] The Bible for a while.
[time=1589] When we hear the word missions we raise this question.
[time=1592] Me?
[time=1593] A missionary?
[time=1596] With somewhat of a sense of mixed fear and open rejection.
[time=1602] When we hear about being a witness we're often immediately isolated and say no I can't be a witness.
[time=1609] I can't tell anybody about Christ.
[time=1612] In my years of working with churches and church people I find two reasons why we're not convinced that we ought to be witnesses for Christ.
[time=1622] Reason number one is the exceptional ability of those who do it so well.
[time=1627] Like Billy Graham.
[time=1629] You've never seen him in person probably none of us have missed him by way of television.
[time=1634] He's always so well prepared.
[time=1636] So articulate.
[time=1638] He illustrates perfectly and he has that southern draw that is just what our Yankee ears tend to listen to.
[time=1647] He is compelling.
[time=1648] He does it so well.
[time=1650] And at the end of his message when he says thousands are coming you come to thousands come.
[time=1658] And we're intimidated by those who do it so well.
[time=1663] We say I could never witness for Christ.
[time=1666] But we're also intimidated by those who do it so poorly.
[time=1672] That we say I'll never witness for Christ.
[time=1675] I don't want to be labeled one of those guys.
[time=1678] Have you ever been button hold at the airport when you're trying to do the O.J. Simpson routine?
[time=1684] Making in from one connection to the other and somebody grabs you tries to give you literature or sell you a flower in the name of a religion and you're going oh.
[time=1694] What I want religion to do is deliver me from this guy.
[time=1698] Or maybe you've got an overzealous friend who in your office pushes Christ in such a dogmatic way
[time=1706] insensitive that you've retreated.
[time=1709] You say I'll not be a witness for Christ because I don't want to be labeled like them.
[time=1713] We're intimidated by those who do it so well and we're intimidated by those who do it so poorly.
[time=1719] Maybe this will help you to understand what we mean.
[time=1743] [Laughter]
[time=1749] Hi Chuck's missed my name.
[time=1752] Haven't I seen you here before?
[time=1754] I don't know.
[time=1755] Sure we have. Sure we have.
[time=1761] Man, isn't this a beautiful day out there?
[time=1764] It's gorgeous out there.
[time=1766] It's nice.
[time=1770] Boy, just look at that sky, would you?
[time=1774] Make sure you think about eternal things, don't it?
[time=1778] Like life and death?
[time=1781] Let me tell you something.
[time=1783] The average down the street, he never thinks about death.
[time=1787] You know why? Let me tell you.
[time=1790] Does it know where he's going?
[time=1792] Me? No, I know where I'm going.
[time=1796] The Bible says I'm going to heaven because I'm saying I know where I'm going.
[time=1803] Hey, where are you going?
[time=1805] Taxi.
[time=1806] Third man, I know where I'm going to.
[time=1808] Hey, we just didn't eat my accident, you know.
[time=1813] Oh, Lord, another scene planted.
[time=1816] Hi, beautiful day, innit?
[time=1819] Thanks, Jay and Keith.
[time=1829] You've met that guy somewhere before today, haven't you?
[time=1833] And when you met that guy, you said, uh-uh, not this fella.
[time=1839] I'm never going to become a religious fanatic.
[time=1842] I'm going to be one of God's secret agents.
[time=1848] Jesus made a remarkable statement.
[time=1851] He said, my Holy Spirit's going to come in you.
[time=1855] He's going to enable you.
[time=1857] He's going to live in you.
[time=1859] And then you will be my witnesses.
[time=1864] He never gave us a choice.
[time=1867] He said we're going to be his witnesses.
[time=1869] The only choice we have is whether we'll be a good one or a bad one.
[time=1874] If you have your Bible today, we're going to do a little bit of yellow page work.
[time=1877] You know, let your fingers do the hopping.
[time=1879] But start off, if you would, in 2 Timothy, chapter 2 and verses 1 and 2.
[time=1887] It gives a philosophy of missions.
[time=1891] It gives a mission for life.
[time=1894] It answers the question, me?
[time=1897] A missionary with a definitive yes.
[time=1901] 2 Timothy 2, verse 1, Paul writes to a man who he led to Christ by the name of Timothy.
[time=1910] You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Jesus Christ
[time=1916] and the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses
[time=1922] entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.
[time=1930] God's plan for missions does include the building of hospitals in Bangladesh.
[time=1936] It includes translating the Bible into languages that have never heard the gospel.
[time=1942] It includes planting churches in Timbuktu.
[time=1946] But the basic root of missions is somebody who knows Jesus Christ
[time=1954] telling somebody else who doesn't know Jesus Christ.
[time=1959] In this short passage that we have just read, there are four generations of Christians.
[time=1967] Generation number one is Paul.
[time=1969] It's referred to in the simple word me.
[time=1972] The things that you have heard me say.
[time=1975] What happened was this.
[time=1977] Paul wasn't born a Christian.
[time=1980] In fact, as an adult, he wasn't disposed towards Christianity.
[time=1985] He was hostile. He was angry.
[time=1988] And he had determined he was going to squelch it.
[time=1992] And his life submission was to eliminate Christians.
[time=1997] And he had a life-changing experience on the way to a distant city by the name of Damascus with credentials in his pocket that authorized him taking prisoner any Christians.
[time=2010] But on that road he met Jesus Christ.
[time=2014] It was unique. It doesn't happen today.
[time=2016] But God uniquely called Paul and he became a believer in Christ.
[time=2022] And his life mission became, instead of squelching out Christianity, announcing Christianity, he did it in large auditoriums of his day
[time=2034] by standing in the temple.
[time=2036] He did it one-on-one with people, but he saw himself as a man who knew Christ
[time=2042] the mission of telling other men who didn't know about Christ.
[time=2046] One of those men was Timothy.
[time=2048] He's the second generation of Christians in this passage.
[time=2052] The things you have learned of me.
[time=2057] Paul led Timothy through a life's pilgrimage till he came to the point where he said, I do believe that Jesus Christ was Lord and God, that he died from my sins, and now I sign over the deed to my soul to him.
[time=2075] But he did more than bring Timothy to that point of inception.
[time=2079] He stuck with him. He taught him. He trained him.
[time=2082] He equipped him with the scriptures to the point where he can now say to Timothy, now you take it to a third generation.
[time=2090] You communicate God's word to reliable men.
[time=2095] Don't let the relay stop.
[time=2099] Teach it to others who are reliable.
[time=2103] Equip them and train them so that they then, because of their reliable character, will be able to take it to a fourth generation, others as well.
[time=2114] God's plan for missions being spread is simply people to people sharing the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2124] In the church vocabulary, there are what are called MKs and PKs.
[time=2128] Have you ever heard of MKs and PKs?
[time=2131] And MK is a missionary kid. We've got lots of men in our church.
[time=2135] There are kids whose parents have been missionaries and they usually grew up on bananas and fig leaves, you know, in some jungle somewhere.
[time=2144] They're called MKs.
[time=2146] PKs, you probably figured out, they're preachers kids.
[time=2149] There are three of them in our house.
[time=2152] They are usually notorious for how they grow up.
[time=2156] I have made a thorough study of why there are such problems with preachers kids, and have concluded it's because they hang around with the deacons and elders kids, and those values rub off.
[time=2170] But there's a third group. There are MKs, PKs, and OKs.
[time=2176] Ordinary kids. That's what most of us are.
[time=2180] They grew up ordinary. My background couldn't be more plain.
[time=2184] We grew up on a street like almost every street in Fort Wayne.
[time=2188] I got into the usual types of trouble that ordinary kids got into, lied to cover my trail like ordinary kids got into, and then got in trouble twice.
[time=2198] Once for what I did, and the second time for lying about it.
[time=2202] Ordinary. And you know what God uses in missions?
[time=2206] OK people. People who are OK.
[time=2210] Just ordinary kids.
[time=2214] Not superheroes, but people who will one on one tell others about Christ.
[time=2222] In this passage it tells us a little bit about how we go about it.
[time=2226] Two words. First it says, "Stand strong." My compliments to Jay as he approached Keith. He didn't lack boldness, decisiveness, or strength.
[time=2238] And there's something about being bold and daring, and most of us could use a heavy dose of it. We're to be strong for Christ. We're not to be timid. We're not to be bashful. Shire retreating, but strong.
[time=2254] But the second word is this, grace.
[time=2258] We are to be strong in the grace of the Jesus Christ. Strength can be manipulating and dominating, but it never brings anyone to Christ.
[time=2270] It's always our graciousness that's the form of our appeal. The Bible says, "Let your speech be always full of grace seasoned with salt so that you will be able to know how to answer everyone.
[time=2286] Softness blended with strength.
[time=2290] Manliness blended with gentleness before a gentle man." It's the rare blend of both that is compelling.
[time=2302] In this passage, the word missionary is absent.
[time=2306] In fact, it is absent from every page of the Bible. The word does not occur. In ancient or modern languages, contemporary or thirsty old vocabularies of English, the word does not occur.
[time=2322] But it describes who we are.
[time=2326] We are people with a mission.
[time=2330] People with a commission that God has said, "I want you to be my ambassador, to be my witness, to be my means of telling others about Christ." You know, if God's only plan was to rescue us from sin, then the moment you accepted Christ as your Savior, he would probably take you to heaven then. The Bible tells us that God, someday, is going to rescue us from all the tribulation of this world. That event is called the Rapture. You'll hear a lot about it.
[time=2366] A year ago, a man wrote a book announcing that Jesus was coming again. The Rapture would occur in 1988 in the month of September. September came and went and so did the copies of those books. He has recalculated, redocumented, and he has now discovered that he was off by one year.
[time=2386] Jesus is coming in September of '89.
[time=2390] I plan on preaching on that book in October of this year.
[time=2394] We don't know when he's going to come.
[time=2398] We make a mistake in suggesting that we do.
[time=2402] God's plan is for us to stay right here and to be a missionary, to be in a witness, to be an ambassador, just old-cate people telling others about Christ. Jesus is coming, and if he's coming, in September of '89, you know what the most important thing your eye could do is to tell people about Jesus.
[time=2426] And if he doesn't come until September of '90, you know what the most important thing we could do to tell other people about Christ. And if he doesn't come until the year 2000 and '90, the best thing we can do as God gives us days is to tell people about Christ. That's why he has left us here.
[time=2446] Though the word missionary doesn't occur, there are at least these six things that you and I are called to be.
[time=2454] And I think they give us a good picture of what we are to be.
[time=2458] First, we are to be a witness. In Acts chapter 1, verse 8, we quoted it early, Jesus said, "You will be my witnesses." When the judge pounds the gavel down, calls court into session, first the prosecutor makes his opening statement.
[time=2478] The charges are levied against the defendant, and then witnesses are called. A witness is somebody who has personal experience.
[time=2490] It may be a detective who has researched the case.
[time=2494] It may be a bystander. They may have a pad like this from which they collect their thoughts reading their notes.
[time=2502] But a witness is someone who is an eye witness or an ear witness of what is being contested that day.
[time=2514] It's not a second-hand story. It's not folklore or tradition.
[time=2518] It's not, I heard it through the great vine, but it's what I saw.
[time=2522] What I know. In 1 John, here's what the apostles Paul, now the apostle John. That's why they call it 1 John.
[time=2530] John said, "That which was from the beginning which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, what our hands have touched.
[time=2542] This we proclaim to you." John was saying, "I'm an eye witness.
[time=2550] I was there. I kept the notes, and what I'm telling you is not hearsay. It's not myth, but my eyes saw it. My ears heard his voice, and I recognized it.
[time=2566] My hands actually went around and embraced him.
[time=2570] I'm an eye witness." Thomas was not there when John was. John and the others report to Thomas, and Thomas says, "You guys have been in this upper room too long.
[time=2582] You're going stair crazy. I'm not going to believe any of this until I see it. And until I touch it, when I see the hands that have been pierced, when I stick my hand in his garment and examine firsthand the pierced side, then I'll believe.
[time=2602] Jesus comes.
[time=2606] It stretches out those hands that Thomas had seen as he cared for the dead body.
[time=2614] Then Jesus pulled back his garment and exposed a punctured side, a wound of a Roman lands. And Thomas said, "I believe." And he gave the greatest yet simplest confession of all time.
[time=2630] My Lord, and my God.
[time=2634] Jesus' response is one that you and I need to hear.
[time=2638] Jesus said, "Thomas, you believe because you have seen. I tell you, blessed are those who believe and yet have not seen." I can't tell you the day that at age 36 there was a time when I saw Jesus. Oh, I examined his hands.
[time=2654] I can't say that. We have a story to tell.
[time=2658] You see, I was a high school student. My life lacked direction. Oh, I wanted to swim fast. I wanted to get good enough grades that I would still be eligible come Friday's.
[time=2670] Half of my friends were really good guys. The other half of my friends were pretty rotten. And I, I was like my friends.
[time=2678] Whoever I was with.
[time=2682] I came in discovery as a junior in high school that Jesus Christ was real.
[time=2686] I can't tell you I've seen the body. I've heard the voice. But I do know this that in the pages of scripture I examined a Jesus who became a reality in my own life. And I know that he's real because he gave a high school student a sense of mission, a sense of purpose and a sense of direction.
[time=2702] I can witness that. What's your story?
[time=2706] What is it that you know of Christ? Tell it.
[time=2710] But as a witness, we have another responsibility.
[time=2714] Not just the responsibility to tell the story, but a responsibility to live the story.
[time=2722] You see, if you're a witness, no matter how well you have documented your accounts, if you are not a reliable witness, your testimony will be discarded. In fact, if you make a strong case for the prosecutor, the defense attorney will try to discredit your testimony.
[time=2742] He'll try to bring up inconsistencies in your life.
[time=2746] He'll try to show that you have a secondary cause for offering your words that you struck a deal, that you're indicting this one to get yourself off, that you should not be trusted.
[time=2758] And in the witness stand of life, if there's not integrity, then a watching world will say, I'm not real impressed with the Christ that changed his life.
[time=2770] Not much of a change.
[time=2774] Don't tell me about your Bible study. I heard what you said when the boss chewed you out. You got right back at him.
[time=2782] Don't tell me you're different. There's money grabbing and greedy as the rest of us. A witness has to have the character to back up his words. Third thing you should know about a witness is a witness is a man who takes risks.
[time=2798] In fact, if you took the Greek word out of acts for witness and changed it from Greek letters to English letters, you would come up with our word martyr.
[time=2810] Because very quickly after you were a witness for Christ, you then became a martyr for Christ in Paul's day.
[time=2818] We are so privileged. No one will take your life here in America today for being a witness for Christ, but there's still a risk that you take. You run the risk that your family will think you're a religious fanatic. They may purposefully plan family get-togethers on Sunday morning just to aggravate you to see if you will go to church and show up late or whether you'll be one of the family. Your boss may force on you tough situations just so that he can see if you'll snap.
[time=2854] Others in your world may let your friends know that you're a little different now. They may call you the preacher.
[time=2862] They may find some way of ridiculing you. And many of you and occasionally I have failed to be as bold for Christ as we should be because of the risk that it takes.
[time=2874] Yet we are called to be witnesses. We don't have a choice.
[time=2878] Jesus said you are my witnesses. We are only choosing daily to be good ones or to be bad ones.
[time=2886] Well there's a second thing that we're called to be along with witnesses.
[time=2890] That is, we're called to be an ambassador. A little nobility if you will. In 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 it is Paul who wrote these words. He said that we are God's ambassadors. 2 Corinthians 5-20. We are therefore Christ ambassadors as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf be reconciled to God.
[time=2922] God who made him who had no sin to be sin for us that we might be the righteousness of God.
[time=2930] An ambassador is an individual who represents his country to a completely different country. The Latin word was lagatus.
[time=2942] No doubt this is the imagery Paul has in mind. And in the Roman world there were two types of provinces. There was a senatorial province. They were under the jurisdiction of the Senate.
[time=2954] There was no army there because there was no rebellion there. But there was a second kind of province. They were called the imperial provinces because they were under the rule of the emperor. And they were under the emperors designate the lagatus, the ambassador.
[time=2970] And the ambassador ruled the province with the assignment of the emperor in the assistance of the military.
[time=2978] One piece was brought to this province the Senate would send 10 legatae 10 ambassadors who would come establish a constitution, a peace treaty, and they would bring this province into the family of the Roman Empire.
[time=2998] No doubt that is the political imagery when Paul said we are Christ ambassadors.
[time=3006] That there is a world that is in hostility towards God. And God has sent us to establish a peace treaty with them.
[time=3018] One of the problems is the world in which we live doesn't understand that there is a treaty that needs to be drawn. There are a lot like Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau was asked in his old age, have you made your peace with God to which the philosopher responded I didn't know that we had ever quarreled.
[time=3042] Thoreau was humorous but he was also ignorant. As smart as he was, he was ignorant of the fact that we are separated from God by sin. May not be anything by secular standards that is graphic or vile. It may simply be our apathetic indifference to God but we are an enemy with God. And Jesus has drafted a peace treaty. He was the first in Christ who had never sinned, became sin for us and died and now there is a peace treaty.
[time=3082] And God puts the peace treaty in your hand and in mind and says take the good news of peace to everyone. Andrew Jackson's most famous battle was the Battle of New Orleans. Remember the songs about it? Well we fired our guns in the British Kepler coming. There weren't near as many as there was a while ago. That Battle of New Orleans accounted for nothing because the war was already over.
[time=3114] The Battle of New Orleans was fought on January the 8th, 1815 and on Christmas Eve 1814 in the city of Gent Belgian, a treaty was signed.
[time=3126] England surrendered.
[time=3130] America was free but people died because no one had delivered the treaty to them.
[time=3138] You and I hold God's treaty.
[time=3142] We are His ambassadors to this community and to this world and if we don't tell them about the terms of peace with God, they'll never hear it.
[time=3154] Back to 2 Timothy chapter 2 for a third thing we are called to be. We are called to be God soldiers.
[time=3162] Now some of us are aggressive and we're militant in our spirit and now we like that imagery. Give me a sword. I'll do a little converting.
[time=3170] Do you ever wonder why the Islamic faith spread around the world almost instantly? They said would you like to become one of us? The guy said no I don't think so. He said now would you like to become one of us? And suddenly he said yes I'm convinced. You know that's often how we approach Christianity with hostility and aggression.
[time=3194] Do you know a man persuaded against his will is of his own opinion still? You can't argue anybody into the kingdom of God.
[time=3202] You can't fight with anybody and bring them to faith in Christ.
[time=3206] We do have a sword but it's not stainless steel forged by Wilkinson. It's the living dynamic word of God that's filled with promises of peace and of reconciliation. We're to be strong like soldiers but to fight with a sword of his word. Here in 2 Timothy it tells us three things about being soldiers. First like a soldier in verse 3 we must endure hardship like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
[time=3238] No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs.
[time=3242] He wants to please as commanding officer. Soldiering is hard work.
[time=3246] So is being an ambassador and a witness for Christ. Secondly soldiers have a controlling sense of mission. There are things that a soldier does and there are things that a soldier does not do by simple nature of the fact that he or she is a soldier.
[time=3266] The fact that they are in the military controls their life.
[time=3270] They get involved in some things that we're free to because they're soldiers. As believers we have a unique walk because we're soldiers for Christ. And thirdly a soldier lives to please as commanding officer.
[time=3286] I'm not to live to please myself. I'm not to live to please public opinion. I'm to live to please Christ. One of the mistakes we commonly make in Christianity is we don't know who the enemy is. First of all most churches spend their time firing at other Christians. We most sharply delineate ourselves from those who are closest to us. And we treat someone as an enemy because they don't go to our church or our denomination. But if they know and love Christ they're part of the family. That jolta Selman he spoke at graduation told a humorous story. In 1815 the commander of the British Navy in the Saint Morn Sea Way commander Phelps was told to hold his position outside of Quebec until the British Army arrived to fight the French. And then he was to provide artillery recovery. Theps got impatient got bored and he and his men noticed a big cathedral that had huge statues of saints that annoyed him.
[time=3350] So they turned their artillery and they began blowing up the saints when the British army arrived they were out of position and out of ammo.
[time=3358] So many of us as believers spent all of our time fighting each other. When it comes time to the real war we're out of position and we're out of ammo.
[time=3370] The real enemy is not others in Christ and the real enemy is not people without Christ. They're the victim of the enemy. The enemy is Satan they are the hostages that desperately need to be freed. We can free them by being soldiers and telling the story. The fourth thing we're called to be is an athlete. Look at the next verse. It says this similarly if anyone competes as an athlete he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules. One of the things that the Greeks liked was the athletic competition and the throwing of the discus you may have seen the famous stature of the discus thrower. But in throwing the discus there is a fault line. If your foot crosses the line be it by a full step or just a hairs breath you're disqualified. It doesn't matter whether you won the last ten contests you're out. It doesn't matter if you hold the world's record if you cross that line you're out.
[time=3438] It doesn't matter whether you throw the discus 20 yards further than anyone else. If you cross it by a half inch they don't give you 19 foot, 11 inches and a half credit. You're out.
[time=3454] An athlete must compete according to the rules. If we are a believer in Christ we must obey him or we can be disqualified. The fifth thing we're called to be a farmer. A farmer I am not. Each year we plan a garden. Each year we say next year we better take better care of our garden.
[time=3474] We planted a garden this year.
[time=3478] It didn't do too well. We blame it on the fact that right after we planted our garden we got four inches of rain in one night.
[time=3486] Our carrots floated down to where the lettuce was, the lettuce migrated up to where the tomatoes were and we've got a tossed salad before we ever harvest a thing. Then we blame it on the fact that after we got a one day a four inches of rain then we got four weeks of drought.
[time=3502] But really our garden didn't make it because we didn't use this and we didn't use this because it's hard work.
[time=3510] You're going to be an ambassador for Christ. It's hard work.
[time=3522] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Brian Loessen. Our pastor Rick Hawks continued his series on missions. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your savior just before we close I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. Will you bow and pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father I am indeed thankful that you came to die on the cross for my sins and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today. In Jesus name I pray Amen.
