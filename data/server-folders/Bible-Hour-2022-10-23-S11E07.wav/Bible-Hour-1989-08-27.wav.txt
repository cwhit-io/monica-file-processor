[time=116] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=119] Thank you for joining us.
[time=121] Our guest speaker today will be Dr. Ken Cole, a missionary to the Philippines.
[time=126] Dr. Cole has entitled his message today, "Wonder of Wonders." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us as Dr. Cole shares with us.
[time=138] Our special music today will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir, Reflection, and Joni King.
[time=150] The Bible Hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=159] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=165] Now, here's Rick.
[time=167] I also want to welcome our friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=171] We trust that God will use this hour in your life to draw you closer in your relationship with Him.
[time=179] If you're a searcher today, you've never given your heart to Christ.
[time=182] We want you to know that our doors and our hearts are open to you.
[time=186] We're glad that you've come today to examine the claims of the Bible and of Jesus Christ who gives us eternal life.
[time=195] It's our purpose to declare His glory here and among the nations.
[time=200] Our choir sings of that truth for us now.
[time=204] [MUSIC - 162 seconds]
[time=386] We again come before you, thanking the Lord for the good things that He's done for us.
[time=390] And again, we need to praise the name of the Lord because of our salvation and continue to tell the story, Him number 296.
[time=398] We have a story to tell to the nations.
[time=401] We'll sing verses 1, 3, and 4 together.
[time=404] [MUSIC - 319 seconds]
[time=743] Hello again.
[time=744] It's early Sunday morning here.
[time=746] And we're recording just a few words to share directly with you friends who join us for the Bible Hour.
[time=752] We've snuck away from the morning worship service so we could have just a moment with you.
[time=757] We like to tell you of coming events in the life of our church and community, and there's certainly a lot right around the corner.
[time=764] Orick, this is the fall season and our church has a very busy schedule at this time.
[time=769] We are always excited when we bring in special musical guests for our own people's edification as well as those that watch by television.
[time=776] And Buddy Green will be with us on September 16th.
[time=780] Well, I'm looking forward to Buddy Green.
[time=782] We've mentioned this to you the last few weeks.
[time=784] He is a multi-talented musician.
[time=787] What are some of the variety of things that he does?
[time=790] Orick, he writes his own music and he sings very well and he plays the harmonica beautifully.
[time=795] That's probably not my favorite instrument.
[time=798] My dad used to play it around the house when I was young and I didn't think a whole lot of it.
[time=802] But he really has a talent on that harmonica and really makes it come alive.
[time=807] You know, I have often snickered as I said, he plays the harmonica because that sounds so...
[time=813] Oh, really? We're going to come to a harmonica concert, but it's fantastic.
[time=817] The variety of music he can play, he can make it sound like a Jewish folk tune, he can make it sound country and western,
[time=824] he can make it sound like a full orchestra on the William Tell Overture.
[time=828] And he's quite famous, some of the people he's traveled with.
[time=831] Oh, Rick, maybe some of the people have seen him with the Bill Gather Trio as they travel around in Fort Wayne area.
[time=838] If you've ever gone to the praise gathering, he is often there and just contributes a great deal to those ministries.
[time=846] And he's really a down-home boy. In fact, I was mentioning to you that if you like a fellow that comes in suspenders with no sport coat, that's Buddy Green.
[time=854] He'll just be... you'll be right at home with him.
[time=856] Well, we want to invite you to join us for a Saturday night concert September the 16th at 7 o'clock right here in the worship center.
[time=865] And then a second event coming up that we want to include you as a part of is an open house.
[time=871] We've been doing this about every six months and it's so well received, we wanted to take an opportunity this fall to host another open house.
[time=880] On Sunday morning, September the 17th, we are opening up our church as it's always opened up.
[time=886] But also the television control room and studio so that you, friends who watch by way of the Bible can come in and see it from the back side.
[time=895] Not just the little window you get through a camera lens, but you can see the staging, you can see the control room, you can see where Pete and I are positioned today.
[time=903] It's an open house. But more than that, it's an invitation to join us live and in person for a morning worship service.
[time=911] We have two of those there at 915 and at 1050 and we'd love to have you come for those.
[time=918] Finally today, allow me to encourage you again to write for a booklet that we've published here at Blackhawk on the deity of Christ.
[time=926] It is alarming that so many people in our country, when asked if they believe in Jesus, would say yes.
[time=934] And if they were asked specifically what they believed about Jesus, they wouldn't have any idea who he was and how they could have confidence that he indeed was Lord and God.
[time=946] So this booklet is given to you as a gift to help strengthen your faith in Christ.
[time=951] You can write for this booklet today, right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=962] That's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=970] Thank you, Pete, and let me just remind you of those key dates coming up again.
[time=975] On Saturday night at 7 o'clock September the 16th, we have our concert with Buddy Green.
[time=981] And then the next morning, Sunday morning at 915 and 1050, we have our worship services and we're hosting an open house.
[time=990] Following the 1050 service, which we'll end right about noon, we'll open up the television studio and come forward and we'll be able to see you behind the scenes how the Bible Hour comes to you.
[time=1001] Thanks for joining us here today.
[time=1031] [MUSIC - 215 seconds]
[time=1258] â™ª
[time=1265] One of the ways that we can know our Lord best is by studying and memorizing his words, so his words are actually in our heart. I'd invite you to stand now as we recite the memory verse for the month of November. Let's try that again, the month of August, I believe. If you're new or visiting our church or not even sure what month it is, if you'll refer to the inside of your bulletin, you can follow along with us. John, 2021.
[time=1294] Again, Jesus said, "Peace be with you," as the Lord is sent to me, I am sent to you, John, 2021. Thank you. You may be seated.
[time=1308] Thank you, Dale, and thanks to each of you who've made it your habit during this month of August to memorize that verse. We hope that it gives to you a sense of purpose and a sense of purpose.
[time=1323] And of mission in life. That our mission is to know Jesus Christ personally and fully and then to make him known. Would you bow with me that we could pray together? Father, we would ask you today to capture our imaginations.
[time=1342] The television is so enticing. Movie productions are so involved. They grab our attention second by second, and yet we need to know on the inside of a sense of purpose and a sense of mission that goes beyond entertainment, that goes beyond the fascination of the eyes.
[time=1365] For many of us, we've had our fill of life's pleasures. We have been somewhat of self-appointed samplers of everything that looked to be good, and we've had it all, and we're still empty.
[time=1381] Father, we would ask you to give a heartfelt sense of meaning and purpose. So we invite you to speak to our hearts today to help us to separate out from our lives, that which has real value, and that which will only fade away when morning comes.
[time=1401] We would pray today that as we open up our Bibles, that you would open up our hearts, and you would put your word deep within us, give us, as Jesus said, ears to hear this morning.
[time=1417] And then we too pray for your healing and your comfort in the lives of many who are here. We ask you to give that father who is frustrated in ignoring his children, a new heart, to want to be a godly father, and an attentive husband.
[time=1437] We ask you to give to mothers who are frustrated today, because there are so many little fingers and so many voices that constantly call for their attention.
[time=1448] May this hour be an hour of oases and relief, but may your spirit give them strength for their duty and their opportunity.
[time=1457] We pray for those who are physically struggling today. We pray for Henry Flowers and Bob Mansfield's mother that they would each recover from a heart attack.
[time=1469] We pray for George as he has a heart catheterization tomorrow that it might show that he has strength, and we ask you to return to him as health.
[time=1478] We would pray today for those who are battling with cancer, for Kim Lowson's father and Greg Hindle, for your hand to be upon their lives and to give them strength and health.
[time=1492] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1497] This morning we end our month of emphasis in missions with a guest speaker who is really not much of a guest in that he's from Fort Wayne and won their home.
[time=1507] They make Black Hawk home as much as possible. Ken and Alice Cole have been missionaries for a number of years in the land of the Philippines.
[time=1516] Ken, by education and former occupation, is a medical doctor, a pediatrician.
[time=1522] So those of you with children with runny noses may want to talk to Ken after the service today.
[time=1527] He served in the Philippines in the area of Leyte as a medical doctor doing missions work.
[time=1533] While he was there, it was his observation that the nation was in far greater need of spiritual healing than it was a physical healing.
[time=1541] So when he was home, he retooled himself and went back and now is working to establish churches to present the gospel of Jesus Christ to people.
[time=1551] We're delighted that they're home and Ken, welcome back to Black Hawk.
[time=1559] Thank you, Pastor Rick, and indeed it's our privilege to be back home again here in Indiana and back at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1567] We want to thank you so much for supporting us these last four years while we've been in the Philippines, both your prayer support and of course your financial support.
[time=1578] And most of all we want to thank you for sending Pastor Rick and Kathy out to see us several years ago.
[time=1584] That was a real encouragement to us and we hope that sometime this Manila team will finally get together and come out and see us too.
[time=1593] My wife and I love musicals and we like to ask trivia questions about the different musicals that we have seen or heard.
[time=1602] And my favorite musical is Fiddler on the Roof, the story of the Jewish people in Russia at the turn of the century just before the Bolshevik Revolution.
[time=1613] And in Fiddler on the Roof is a song done by the tailor, I believe his name is Mato, and he's singing to the oldest daughter of Tevia.
[time=1624] And he sings a love song called Wonder of Wonders, Miracle of Miracles.
[time=1629] And in the song he recounts all of the wonderful things that God has done for the nation of Israel.
[time=1637] And then of course he concludes about saying what a wonderful thing it is that he and this girl have been created and have met together and they are in love.
[time=1647] But that's just a nice song because it talks about the wonder of God in their lives.
[time=1654] Wonder of Wonders. Open with me and your Bibles to the Book of Acts, Acts chapter 2, right after the Gospels.
[time=1666] Acts chapter 2 is an exciting part of the history of the church because this is where the church is actually formed, comes into being.
[time=1676] Jesus had promised the coming of the Holy Spirit and told the disciples to wait for the coming of the Spirit in Jerusalem.
[time=1685] And in Acts chapter 2 we pick up the story in verse 1.
[time=1690] When the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place, suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
[time=1701] They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire. This separated and came to rest on each of them.
[time=1707] All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
[time=1714] Now there were staying in Jerusalem God fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
[time=1719] When they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
[time=1728] And then it goes on and tells of all the different ethnic groups that were in Jerusalem that day and the different dialects that they spoke.
[time=1736] Here we see the coming of the Holy Spirit and God had promised.
[time=1740] And the arrival of the Spirit is accompanied by speaking in foreign languages.
[time=1747] And then we come down after these descriptions of the languages to the end of verse 11.
[time=1753] We hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues, our own languages.
[time=1761] Wonders. In Acts chapter 2 the word wonder appears four times.
[time=1767] And we want to look at all four of those wonders.
[time=1770] Here's the first wonder. Verse 11 declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues.
[time=1776] In the original Greek this word wonder is the word megalaya which means great or wonderful.
[time=1784] We use that word mega in terms of mega box or mega ball or anything that's great or very enormous is mega.
[time=1794] We're using a Greek root word and that's the word used here in the scriptures.
[time=1799] Here we see the apostles not yet telling the message of redemption.
[time=1805] That's coming up soon, the message of repentance.
[time=1808] What they're doing right now is praising God.
[time=1811] They're declaring the wonders of God.
[time=1814] And they're doing it in all of these different foreign languages as God enabled them.
[time=1819] That must have been wonderful.
[time=1821] I had to go to language school to learn how to speak a dialect.
[time=1824] And here they were given the languages instantly by God.
[time=1828] And what are they doing with the ability?
[time=1830] They're praising God and declaring His wonders, the wonder of God.
[time=1837] I think of some verses in the Psalms that talk about the wonder of God.
[time=1842] One of the passages Psalm 78 verse 4 tells us that we are to pass this on.
[time=1850] We will not hide them from their children.
[time=1853] We will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, His power and the wonders He has done.
[time=1862] Do you tell your children, your grandchildren, the wonders that God has done in your life?
[time=1867] I hope so.
[time=1869] Or maybe you don't have any wonders to tell them.
[time=1872] Another verse Psalms 107 verse 8 says, Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men.
[time=1883] The wonder of God.
[time=1886] We have a wonder in our church back in Manila, the Heritage Baptist Church of Kazon City.
[time=1891] The wonder is Mrs. Ophiana.
[time=1894] Mrs. Ophiana is 79 years old and she's been with us from the very beginning when the church got started.
[time=1900] And she's a real worker for God.
[time=1903] Loves to tell people about the wonders of God and what God has done for her and has done in her life.
[time=1910] And her life has not all been a bed of roses.
[time=1913] In fact just a few years ago she and her retired husband had their home entirely destroyed by fire.
[time=1919] And they escaped just barely with their lives by escaping out the back window and onto the roof and the neighbors helped them down.
[time=1926] And it wasn't until later they realized that their souls of their feet were completely charred from the hot heat of the roof.
[time=1934] And yet they were praising God that He had spared their lives in telling the wonders of God to all that they meet.
[time=1940] Frequently when we have a time of praise in our services Mrs. Ophiana will stand up and she usually says something about the wonders of God and something like this.
[time=1950] I thank God that He sent foreign missionaries here to the Philippines to tell me the wonderful story about God and how she came to know Jesus as her personal Lord and Savior.
[time=1963] Do you praise God? Do you have wonders in your life that God has done?
[time=1969] The next wonder in Acts chapter 2 is verse 19.
[time=1973] Here we see the Apostle Peter preaching a sermon explaining about what has just happened and he says from the prophet, the Old Testament prophet Joel, he's quoting about the last days and he says in verse 19,
[time=1986] "I will show wonders in the heaven and above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke, the sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord."
[time=2001] And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
[time=2005] Here we see the word wonder in that God will show wonders in the heaven above.
[time=2011] Now this is talking about End Times, Peter's talking about the last days, the day of the Lord, because the Old Testament prophet Joel saw the future all compacted together.
[time=2023] God did not allow Joel to see all the events that were going to take place. All that Joel knew was that God's spirit was going to come, that everyone from regardless of what nation or language he spoke would have the chance to call in the name of the Lord and be saved.
[time=2040] And that sometime there was going to be a great cataclysm in the end of all things. This was all compacted together.
[time=2047] Now we know from God's word that the Holy Spirit did come at Pentecost. There was the church age when people could be saved from every nation, every tribe calling on the name of the Lord.
[time=2059] And yet we also know from God's word that Jesus is coming again and there is going to be terrible times and we are going to see some day in the sky and the heavens and on earth a terrible cataclysm wonders.
[time=2073] This is a different word here, this wonder. This word in the next two wonders is the Greek word terrata, which means something strange causing the beholder to marvel and it's always in the plural.
[time=2087] Another commentary says that this word means a miracle evoking awe. We could say that God is awesome, or he does awesome things to use a contemporary word.
[time=2100] The important thing here is the focus on verse 21, because here we see the wonder of heaven in that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord can be saved.
[time=2109] Anyone from regardless of what nation or background, color, race, or creed can call on the Lord and experience the wonder of heaven, of knowing for sure that your sins are forgiven and that you have a home in heaven someday.
[time=2126] I remember Mrs. Alina Villarama, one of the first funerals that I did in Manila was for Mrs. Villarama, she died of cancer a few years ago.
[time=2139] When she was still sick and in the hospital and she was oh so sick, I made a visit to her and her daughter-in-law was standing there in the room and she says you know, mom just can't wait to die.
[time=2153] And I said oh really? She said yeah she wants to go see Jesus. I said oh that's wonderful.
[time=2160] And I sat by her bedside and I talked to Mrs. Villarama and I prayed with her and comforted her and I thought what an assurance to know that your sins are forgiven and that she wants to die because she knows for sure that she's going to be home in heaven with Jesus.
[time=2180] The wonder of heaven.
[time=2183] This past Easter our little church got acquired together and decided to do an Easter cantata and they asked me if I had a cantata and I said no I really don't.
[time=2193] So he said well we'll put one together.
[time=2195] They got some songs and hymns about the crucifixion and the resurrection and some verses of scripture.
[time=2200] We put together for a narrative and some of the choir members dressed up like Pontius Pilate and Judas and Jesus and Mary Magdalene.
[time=2208] And they sang this wonderful songs to, we had a packed out audience there, plenty of visitors there, listing.
[time=2215] And the final song was because he lives I can face tomorrow.
[time=2220] And as they were seeing it, I noticed in the front row our lead alto, barbie cop, or I'll start crying.
[time=2227] And as I watched her sing there I know she was looking at someone else and she was looking at our choir directors, Villamy.
[time=2233] And I looked at Villamy and she was crying and I thought oh dear the choir director is crying.
[time=2237] And I look back again and hear the soprano Priti Dungug was crying.
[time=2241] And pretty soon the whole row of girls in the front were all crying as they were singing because he lives.
[time=2246] Because Jesus Christ lives I have hope.
[time=2250] I have a tomorrow.
[time=2252] And that's a wonder.
[time=2254] And my friend do you have that wonder?
[time=2257] Do you know for sure that if you died today that you would go to be with Jesus in heaven?
[time=2262] An experience that wonderful place called heaven, our other wonder here in Acts chapter 2 is found in verse 22.
[time=2273] Peter goes on with the sermon as he preaches and he says men of Israel listen to this.
[time=2278] Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, that's the word again,
[time=2287] and signs which God did among you through him as you yourselves know.
[time=2292] This man was handed over to you by God set purpose and foreknowledge and you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
[time=2301] But God raised him from the dead freeing him from the agony of death because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
[time=2310] Here we see the wonder of salvation and it focuses on Jesus Christ God in the flesh come to earth
[time=2317] and it says God the Father authenticated him with the signs and wonders and miracles.
[time=2324] And yet the focus here is not on those signs wonders and miracles.
[time=2329] God authenticated his son Jesus Christ with it but the focus here is on Christ's death, burial and resurrection.
[time=2337] The important thing here is that Jesus came to save us.
[time=2341] The emphasis is on salvation.
[time=2344] God raised Jesus from the dead and because of that we can be children of God because of what Jesus did for us.
[time=2352] Because his blood shed on the cross for us gives us remission of sins if we just trust in him.
[time=2359] It sounds so simple and yet it can be so difficult.
[time=2364] Right now in the Philippines there's been a controversy that's been raging because in January of this year the Roman Catholic bishops got together and issued a pastoral letter.
[time=2376] The title of the letter was hold fast to what is good.
[time=2379] Let me read to you the Catholic letter.
[time=2382] It was read in all the Roman Catholic churches in the Philippines back in January and early February.
[time=2387] This is from the front page of the Philippine Daily Globe.
[time=2390] The article says what brought us together the Roman Catholic bishops was a serious pastoral concern
[time=2397] about the increasing flow into our country of fundamentalist groups, preachers, TV programs and the harm they caused to many of our faithful.
[time=2406] It says fundamentalists are people who profess with us that the Bible is the word of God but they accept the Bible as the one and only necessary source
[time=2415] of teaching for our salvation and claim that we ought not to believe what is not explicitly taught in the Bible.
[time=2421] They go on and say that the fundamentalist groups are the ones who say that one is saved by faith alone
[time=2428] and that once a person accepts Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior he is already saved.
[time=2434] This leads to a practical neglect of the importance of the Roman Church.
[time=2438] Indeed, one notices that fundamentalist groups have little room for their teaching and take little or no account of tradition in the sacraments.
[time=2447] The fundamentalist insistence on the word of God, their emphasis on a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus
[time=2453] and the warm welcome and fellowship they accord to members and prospective members and the liveliness of their worship services have proven to be a great attraction to the Catholics.
[time=2463] When that letter came out we were all excited, we said praise God, that's exactly right.
[time=2471] You have told the truth, salvation is by faith alone in Jesus Christ, nothing else, no good works, nothing that we can do.
[time=2481] It's a wonder, it's a wonder that Jesus saved me, a sinner, a mere mortal man, condemned to die
[time=2489] and yet because of what Jesus has done I can now stand righteous, clean, stand before an almighty holy God.
[time=2498] That is a wonder and it can be a wonder for you too.
[time=2504] Have you experienced that wonder of salvation in your life?
[time=2508] That wonder that says that your sins are forgiven no longer do you have to search, try hard, be good,
[time=2516] do all of these things, don't do some other things, but simply trust Jesus Christ, he did it for you
[time=2524] and all you need to do is to trust him, be born into God's family, that's a wonder.
[time=2532] Our other wonder is here found in the end of the chapter, Acts chapter 2, beginning at verse 41,
[time=2540] we see that after Peter preached this message, it says those who accepted his message were baptized
[time=2548] and about 3,000 were added to their number that day.
[time=2552] The church in Jerusalem instantly came into being, 3,000 people.
[time=2556] Verse 42, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[time=2563] Everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.
[time=2570] All the believers were together and had everything in common.
[time=2574] Here we see our word again, wonders.
[time=2578] Here's the wonder of the gospel.
[time=2580] Previously we saw God the Father authenticating his son, Jesus Christ, through wonders, through miracles.
[time=2588] And here we see God authenticating the apostles' message through wonders.
[time=2593] It wasn't that the apostles did these things, but God did it through them to show the truth of their message that what they were saying was indeed the words of God,
[time=2604] the wonder of the gospel.
[time=2608] In John chapter 14, verse 12, before Jesus went to the cross, he was talking to his disciples
[time=2614] and he told the disciples that greater things than these they would be able to do, greater things than Jesus Christ.
[time=2622] Now that verse always puzzled me because how could the apostles and even believers today
[time=2628] do greater things than Jesus?
[time=2630] After all, he walked down the water.
[time=2633] I mean, he multiplied loaves and fishes.
[time=2637] He healed people of their diseases.
[time=2640] Now as a physician, I have helped people get well.
[time=2644] And people have been very grateful to me that their child recovered from a fatal illness or something like this.
[time=2651] But I never did what Jesus did and that he would even raise people from the dead.
[time=2657] How can we do greater things than that?
[time=2660] Well, the answer lies in the Scripture when we realize that what Jesus is talking about is that the apostles and we are included in that work with God
[time=2671] are going to be able to bring people to Jesus Christ and see the life-changing work
[time=2678] of the Holy Spirit and the gospel message in people's lives.
[time=2682] And that is a miracle.
[time=2684] That is a wonder that Jesus said is greater than any of the things that he did while he was here on earth.
[time=2692] We can be participants in this wonder of the gospel.
[time=2697] Participants in telling others what Jesus has done for us.
[time=2702] And that's what missions is all about.
[time=2705] Not necessarily going to another country, going to overseas, but going across the street, going to the desk next to you, and telling the person the wonderful things that Jesus has done for you.
[time=2719] And I hope and trust that he did do something wonderful in your life when you experienced that miracle of the new birth, when you were born again born into God's family.
[time=2733] Dr. Joji Palayo was a surgeon in Metro Manila, a very good surgeon and well-known.
[time=2740] He taught at the Philippine General Hospital, University of the Philippines College of Medicine.
[time=2745] I first met Dr. Palayo at his funeral.
[time=2749] You see, Dr. Palayo was in his middle thirties, and he had done surgery that Saturday afternoon on one of our members, our choir director of theville me.
[time=2758] He had done a thyroidectomy, had made his rounds, picked up his wife and was heading home Saturday afternoon on the South Freeway when he was hit head-on and killed instantly.
[time=2770] His wife's sitting in the seat next to them, the seatbelt on walked away with just bruises and scratches.
[time=2777] I was fascinated by the testimony of Dr. Palayo because he was a man who knew God personally and was not ashamed to name the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=2787] I went to the funeral because I wanted to know more about this man that I had heard so much about.
[time=2792] It was sad that I hadn't had a chance to visit with him and meet him personally.
[time=2797] And you know, our member who was operated on there, the whole time in the hospital, were able to tell many of the patients that they met there that Dr. Palayo was in heaven.
[time=2809] And people wanted to know and say, "How do you know that?
[time=2812] How do you know that Dr. Palayo is in heaven for sure?" And they were able to say because he knew Jesus in a personal way, just like we do, and you can know him too.
[time=2824] A few weeks after the death of Dr. Palayo, an actor in -- actually it's Dr. and Dr. Torres came to visit our church.
[time=2834] Dr. Norman Torres was training as a neurosurgeon and his wife as an obstetrician.
[time=2841] And they visited our service and afterwards I got to meet them and I had heard that his wife had recently been born again.
[time=2848] And so I also knew that he was a good friend of Dr. Palayo's.
[time=2852] And I was talking with him and we were talking about the tragedy and the accident and everything.
[time=2857] And I said to Dr. Norman, I said, "You know, Dr. Palayo is in heaven today." I said, "Do you know for sure that if you died today you would go to heaven?" And he changed the subject.
[time=2868] And he went on talking about Dr. Palayo and his wife Elbowdom and she said, "Honey, you didn't answer Dr. Cole's question." And he turned to me kind of embarrassed and he says, "Because I don't know how to answer you right now." And I said, "Hey, how about if we get together this week?" And he said, "All right." And so we tried to set an appointment but as it turns out, the week went by and he was on call a lot at the hospital and we never did get together.
[time=2891] And it really bothered me that Dr. Taurus really didn't know for sure if he was born again.
[time=2897] And the next Sunday they were back again and his wife decided to join the choir.
[time=2901] And so she stayed afterwards for practice.
[time=2904] And so Dr. Taurus was just sitting there listening to the choir and I went up and sat next to him and we were talking shop, you know, "What's the latest brain that he opened up recently?" And all those gross kinds of doctor stuff, you know, we talk about.
[time=2918] And then after we had a few minutes of conversation, I said to him, "Norman, do you remember the question I asked you last week?
[time=2925] Did you know for sure that if you would die today, would you go to heaven?" He looked at me with a big smile on his face and he says, "Dr. Cole, I can answer that question yes today." I said, "Praise the Lord." Dr. Norman Taurus also knew for sure that he was going to heaven and a lot had to do with the fact of the testimony of Joji Palayo, another surgeon who was not ashamed to name the name of Jesus Christ and the wonder of the gospel affected many lives because of that.
[time=2958] And Dr. Norman Taurus and his wife came to know Jesus Christ as their savior and experienced that same wonder, that miracle in their life, the wonder of the gospel.
[time=2972] And here we see God showing the wonders in his church,
[time=2979] the early church, the church in Jerusalem, and it says that there were added 3,000 souls.
[time=2986] Later on in the next chapter, we see that 5,000 people were added to the church.
[time=2991] Later on in other chapters, it says that more and more people were added daily to the church and the church multiplied.
[time=2997] And the Greek words there is the word "meria" that means 10,000 people.
[time=3001] And I tend to believe then that they're saying that the church in Jerusalem evidently had at least 10,000 members.
[time=3009] People who had experienced the wonder of salvation, the wonder of God, the wonder of heaven.
[time=3017] I think of another man in our church, JoJo Amion.
[time=3021] JoJo is a computer programmer and he worked for an insurance company for a while, and his boss was a born-again Christian.
[time=3029] And she had talked to JoJo a few times about his need for Jesus Christ as his personal savior, but JoJo did not receive Christ.
[time=3036] And later on he changed jobs and went to work for the Philippine long distance telephone.
[time=3040] And it turned out that one of our members, Bill Gonzales, also was a computer programmer there at PLDT.
[time=3048] And so he started talking to JoJo and invited him to church and said, "Hey, why don't you come out? We got a brand new church. Baby church started.
[time=3055] Heritage Baptist Church in Kaysen City." JoJo said, "Yeah, I would like to come sometime." Well, he lived on the other end of the city, but he still made an effort.
[time=3063] In fact, Sunday morning came and I'm usually one of the very first ones there at church, and here was this young man waiting already for the service to start, more than 30 minutes before the adult Bible study.
[time=3074] And I got to meet him and talk to him.
[time=3077] And he said that he was really searching for the truth and that people had talked to him about the Bible and about Jesus Christ, and he wanted to come here and find out more about it.
[time=3087] And as he listened that morning to the adult Bible study and then later on the worship service,
[time=3093] when it was over, JoJo and me on came forward and received Christ as his personal savior.
[time=3098] Later on, JoJo was involved in our church, involved in the discipleship training, and part of the requirements was that he had to write out his testimony of how he came to know the Lord as a savior.
[time=3108] And you know what he told me?
[time=3110] He said, "I was searching for the truth, and I was so under conviction by God that when I came to your church that morning, as I sat there in the adult Bible study, it all became clear to me within the first few minutes.
[time=3122] And I prayed in my heart right there and received Christ as my savior.
[time=3127] How is it with you?
[time=3130] Have you experienced the wonder of God in your life, the wonder of the gospel?
[time=3136] Do you know Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
[time=3140] Is God still doing wonders today?
[time=3143] I believe he is.
[time=3145] He's doing the wonder of the new birth.
[time=3148] And if you haven't experienced that, I invite you today to come and talk to Pastor Hawks, Pastor Lantman, one of the church staff, some of the elders here, they'd be glad to show you from the Bible how you can know for sure that your sins are forgiven and that you have a home in heaven, and you can experience the wonder of the new birth.
[time=3170] You can experience the wonder of heaven someday.
[time=3174] Whether you die or whether Jesus comes again, you'll know for sure.
[time=3179] And God is still doing wonders in establishing his church around the world.
[time=3185] Throughout the Philippines and around the world, people are being saved and churches are being started.
[time=3193] I stand in awe as I think that less than three years ago there was no heritage Baptist Church of Kazon City.
[time=3201] And yet today there stands a group of believers meeting together.
[time=3205] They just finished their worship service about 12 hours ago.
[time=3211] They worship the same God.
[time=3214] They studied the Bible. They sang some of the same hymns.
[time=3219] God is still in the business of starting churches around the world.
[time=3223] In fact, in the Philippines alone, the Philippines right now, and the messiologists say the Philippines and Brazil are probably the two most responsive countries in the world today to the gospel.
[time=3236] Churches are being started everywhere.
[time=3239] In fact, there's a bold plan by all the evangelicals to have a gospel church in every village in the Philippines by the year 2000.
[time=3248] And to do that would take 40-some thousand churches.
[time=3254] And they're more than halfway to the goal.
[time=3257] There are more than 800 independent Baptist churches in the Philippines proclaiming the gospel.
[time=3262] God is still in the business of doing wonders.
[time=3266] How about you? Have you experienced the wonder of God?
[time=3271] Has he been doing some wonderful things in your life?
[time=3274] If he hasn't, we invite you to come and experience the wonderful work of salvation.
[time=3281] Become a child of God today. Let's pray.
[time=3287] Our Heavenly Father, we come before you the wonderful God, the great God of wonders, and we even wonder how we can come and stand before your Holy Presence and talk to you in prayer.
[time=3300] And yet it's only because of the wonder you have done through your Son Jesus Christ in providing salvation for us sinful men and women.
[time=3309] That we can experience this wonderful thing called salvation and have our sins forgiven be able to stand before a holy God, righteous, pure, clean, cleansed from our sins.
[time=3320] And we thank you for the wonder that you do in lives today, and the wonders that you do around the world in seeing people saved in churches established proclaiming the wonderful gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3333] Speak to our hearts, Lord, this morning we pray that God may do a wonderful work in our lives even today.
[time=3340] We pray in Jesus' precious name, amen.
[time=3348] Thank you, Dr. Cole. Our attention has been drawn this morning to the person of Jesus Christ and the gospel, which is the good news about him, that it is wonderful.
[time=3361] Isaiah the prophet said, "Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, that his name shall be called, wonderful, counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the prince of peace." He is wonderful, and it is a wonderful experience to give your heart and your life to Christ.
[time=3383] Some have misunderstood.
[time=3385] It doesn't mean that everything is going to become super tremendous.
[time=3388] All things are going to go your way. Life's going to be on a roll.
[time=3391] It's going to be wonderful.
[time=3393] That's not what the word wonderful means here.
[time=3396] What it means is that it is a heaven-sent gift that God will come into your heart, change it, and make of you a brand new creation.
[time=3406] Many of you at this very moment may be like Dr. Torres, or JoJo, that Ken mentioned, in the middle of a spiritual decision in a battle, because you realize that this wonderful gospel is good news, but it requires of you asking Christ to come into your heart and following him as your Lord and Savior.
[time=3430] So you may be at this very moment in the midst of a spiritual battle, you and God.
[time=3438] And so we invite you to take out your hymn books and turn to hymn 371.
[time=3443] The words go like this.
[time=3445] Have thy own way, Lord.
[time=3447] Have thy own way.
[time=3450] Thou art the potter.
[time=3453] I am the clay.
[time=3455] Mold me and make me after thy will, while I am waiting, yielded, and still.
[time=3467] This morning, in the quietness of these moments, would you allow God to have His way in your heart?
[time=3477] In the tug of war between self and the Savior, will you release?
[time=3484] Will you open up your hand and say, "I am your Lord." I recognize that Jesus is Savior, and I ask Him to come into my heart.
[time=3513] It's been our privilege today to present to you music from our sanctuary choir, reflection, and soloist, Joni King.
[time=3521] The message today was from our special guest, Dr. Ken Cole.
[time=3525] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3530] Just before we close, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3534] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3537] Dear Heavenly Father, I am thankful that you sent your Son, Jesus Christ, into the world, to save us from our sins, and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart, and I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my Savior today.
[time=3554] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3563] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
