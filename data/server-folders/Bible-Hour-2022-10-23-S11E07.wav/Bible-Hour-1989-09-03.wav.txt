[time=0] (choir singing in foreign language)
[time=31] Pray together.
[time=32] Father in Heaven, that song says that we are feeble and frail,
[time=39] and we are like dust, and God, we bow before you and recognize that you're the King, and that we know that we need to worship you.
[time=47] (choir singing in foreign language)
[time=90] (choir singing in foreign language) It was a day when strong men stumbled.
[time=111] Columbus had presented his plan to King John II of Portugal, and the King and his advisors refused the notion of Columbus sailing around the world to get to the Orient.
[time=124] They had already made up their minds.
[time=126] You couldn't get east by going west.
[time=129] Ten years later, under a Spanish flag, Columbus sailed the ocean blue, and discovered a whole new continent.
[time=138] Portugal missed the opportunity to discover a whole new world because they said, "Don't confuse me with the facts.
[time=146] "My mind is already made up." (choir singing in foreign language) - Welcome to an hour of Bible study,
[time=165] music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=168] Thank you for joining us.
[time=169] Rick's message today is entitled, "A Layman Walked When Strong Men Stumbled "and is Taken from the Book of Mark." Being objective is not always easy.
[time=180] One person put it this way, "Don't confuse me with the facts.
[time=184] "I've already made up my mind." Today's message is titled, "A Layman Who Walked When Strong Men Stumbled." Price healing of a paralytic man left his spiritual leaders of the day tripping over questions of religious terminology.
[time=199] They became so bogged down in the mire of their thinking that they missed the obvious facts.
[time=204] We want to invite you to an open-minded, objective study of the facts about Jesus Christ.
[time=210] We believe that it can be life-changing.
[time=212] Before our hour ends, Rick will leave us with what he calls, three things to take home.
[time=218] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=223] Rick's text is taken from the Book of Mark, chapter two, verses one through 12.
[time=228] The sanctuary choir will be ministering to us in song.
[time=233] We will also be hearing from Kathy Hawks and Chris Bone.
[time=238] The Bible hour is an outreach ministry of the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and can be seen on this station each week at this time.
[time=249] We pray that the Lord will use this telecast to minister to you.
[time=253] Now here's Rick.
[time=256] - Minister is to your spirit.
[time=258] We also want to welcome our friends who join us by way of television.
[time=262] We hope that God will use an hour of us spending this time together to bring honor and glory to his name and to strengthen the life of each one who's here.
[time=272] It's our privilege of hearing our choir sing as they provide for us an anthem of praise titled "Praise God, the Lord of Hosts." (upbeat music)
[time=292] [MUSIC - 71 seconds]
[time=375] (upbeat music) - We shout aloud to the nations that indeed,
[time=386] God is a God worthy of our praise and he lives within our hearts.
[time=391] We worship him simply because of that thought and that fact that Jesus indeed is our savior.
[time=397] He lives, I serve a risen savior.
[time=399] Him number 220, he lives 220.
[time=403] We'll sing the first and third stanzas together.
[time=433] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=544] - Thank you for that good singing, we appreciate it.
[time=547] We continue with music now as Kathy Hawks comes to minister to us.
[time=551] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 193 seconds]
[time=752] (upbeat music) - Hello again.
[time=770] We look forward to sharing our church's worship service with new friends who join us each week for the Bible Hour.
[time=776] We're also looking forward to sharing a live, in-person concert with Betty Greene in just a few days.
[time=782] It won't be too long, Rick, when Buddy Greene will be with us again.
[time=785] He's presently in Georgia.
[time=787] I just received a little pamphlet from him updating him on his schedule and he was working with a relief group for needy children and families and gave a concert in their behalf.
[time=799] And also he's traveling right now with the Bill Grayther Trail.
[time=803] Some of you may recall, Buddy Greene was with us a year ago when we were in our Convocation Center before moving into the new building.
[time=811] We had a delightful time with him.
[time=813] (upbeat music)
[time=832] - That was, "I need thee every hour." One of the styles of music he does is that quiet devotional, but he has a lot of other varieties.
[time=840] - Well, he plays a lot of variety on the harmonica and he also sings and he plays the guitar and it's an inspiring evening.
[time=845] And Rick, that's coming up on Saturday evening, September 16th at 7 p.m.
[time=851] We wanna make sure that we point out to you that you will need tickets for the concert and you can certainly buy tickets at the door.
[time=858] I believe they're $4, is that right?
[time=860] And they're also at all of the Christian bookstores in Town Anchor Room and Glenbrook at Zandervan Bookstore.
[time=867] And right here at Blackhawk Baptist Church, if you prefer to buy your ticket ahead of time.
[time=872] We hope you can join us for that night, September the 16th.
[time=875] And then also for the next morning, Sunday morning, September the 17th when we're hosting an open house here at the Bible Hour.
[time=884] It's also a friend day at our church and our large church family is gonna invite their friends in and we wanna invite you for an open house.
[time=892] As well as enjoying a morning service live and in person, we'll be opening up the television control room and studio and so that you can see how all these things that take place in a brief hour come to you and your home.
[time=904] So we hope you'll join us for our two morning worship services, one of your choice, either at 9.15 or at 10.50 on Sunday morning, September the 17th.
[time=915] And then the television studio and control room will be open at noon.
[time=920] Looking forward to that open house.
[time=922] Rick, we always get visitors from our community.
[time=924] We have several new subdivisions in our area and I'm excited as our people meet new neighbors and then bring them in for our worship services.
[time=933] Well, we hope you will enjoy us and join us is what I'm really trying to say on that morning.
[time=940] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to encourage you to write today for a book entitled "Closer Walk." About two times a year, we share this booklet with you.
[time=951] It's important that you write for it today because beginning October 1st, "Closer Walk" will take us on a one year tour of the New Testament.
[time=961] On October 1st, we begin a new year with Matthew chapter one and then we'll move through Matthew Mark Luke, John Axe Romans, right through the New Testament and finish up next September with the book of Revelation.
[time=974] It won't take you but about 10 or 12 minutes a day but it will build into your life values for eternity.
[time=981] Most of us know that God's word is important but we somehow lack the discipline and the direction.
[time=987] Well, this booklet will help supply that direction.
[time=990] We hope you'll write for it today.
[time=992] You can receive this helpful pamphlet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1004] Get started in your New Testament study today and use this helpful booklet.
[time=1009] Again, you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1017] Thanks, Pete and thank you for joining us here today by way of television and we hope to meet many of you in person on the 16th for Buddy Green's concert or the 17th for the open house here at Black Hawk and the Bible Hour.
[time=1032] (upbeat music)
[time=1054] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=1098] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=1199] Thank you, Chris.
[time=1204] There is a big difference between joy and happiness.
[time=1207] Happiness is my reaction to what's taking place around me.
[time=1212] Joy is my determined action to take control of the world around me.
[time=1217] The Bible tells us that in life's tough times, God will give us joy to overcome even the trials and the testings of life.
[time=1227] I invite you to bow with me that we could pray together.
[time=1232] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1235] Look full in His wonderful face.
[time=1239] And the things of this world will grow strangely dim in the light of His glory and grace.
[time=1250] Father, we are preoccupied people.
[time=1255] My own mind has hopped through a hundred different topics, even in the last few moments.
[time=1262] I've thought about the children and the picnic tomorrow.
[time=1265] I've thought about bike rides and bills that need to be paid.
[time=1269] I've thought about the moors and their deep herd and the hyndals and their good news.
[time=1275] I've thought about my children and what we might do this afternoon and I've tried to stay focused on you.
[time=1283] But the things of this world do capture my mind and my eye.
[time=1288] So we've at least closed our eyes and are now trying to open our minds to you.
[time=1294] And we ask you by your spirit to capture our attention, to help us to focus not on me, the speaker, but on your word.
[time=1304] Speak to us not because of me, but in spite of me.
[time=1309] Make what we hear today, what we sense in our spirits to be food for life.
[time=1315] We ask you to give us principles to live by and insight to guide us in the choices that we'll make in the next week.
[time=1324] We'd ask you to give comfort.
[time=1326] We pray for Wayne and Debbie Moore and their little girl, Amy.
[time=1330] You would give wisdom to doctors at Riley even this morning.
[time=1334] You would restore to her her health and her life.
[time=1338] We thank you that Henry Flowers is growing stronger.
[time=1342] We praise you that George Lantland's heart is strong and young.
[time=1346] We are so grateful that Greg's hyndals and leukemia is in remission.
[time=1351] We pray that you'll continue to strengthen him through the therapy of protection in the days ahead.
[time=1358] We would ask you to comfort the shin in their family.
[time=1361] Scott, his mother and father, but particularly his brother and sister-in-law in the loss of their baby.
[time=1367] We ask you to cradle them.
[time=1369] We ask you to comfort them.
[time=1372] Father, we pray for those lives that are broken.
[time=1376] Sin has taken its toll, but pride keeps them from coming to you.
[time=1382] Help us today to have enough pride to want to please you but so little that it keeps us trusting in ourselves.
[time=1392] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1397] I have said it to myself in the middle of a presentation from a salesman.
[time=1407] I remember muttering it to my wife during the middle of a political debate as two candidates were giving their viewpoint.
[time=1415] And I'm sure many have said it in the middle of a church service.
[time=1418] The phrase goes something like this.
[time=1421] Don't confuse me with the facts I've already made up my mind.
[time=1426] I would guess that you've been guilty of that.
[time=1429] And I would suppose you've probably been the victim of that too, as you've tried to rationally and calmly persuade somebody with your facts and you could read their faces.
[time=1439] Their theme song was, "I shall, I shall, I shall not be moved." You weren't going to change their mind no matter how much factual evidence you could present.
[time=1449] That was the case in Mark chapter 2, a day when a lame man walked and strong men stumbled.
[time=1457] If you have a Bible, I invite you to open it to Mark chapter 2, and I would like to read for us the first 12 verses.
[time=1466] A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.
[time=1474] So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door,
[time=1480] and he preached the word to them.
[time=1483] Some men came bringing a paralytic carried by four of them.
[time=1489] Since they could not get in to Jesus because of the crowd,
[time=1495] they made an opening in the roof above Jesus.
[time=1499] And after digging through it, lowered the mat, the paralyzed man was on.
[time=1506] When Jesus sawed their faith, he said to the paralytic,
[time=1512] "Son, your sins are forgiven."
[time=1519] Now some teachers of the law were sitting there thinking to themselves, "Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming.
[time=1529] Who can forgive sins but God alone?" Immediately, Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking
[time=1540] in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?" Which is easier to say to the paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven,"
[time=1554] or to say, "Get up, take your mat, and walk."
[time=1561] "But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,"
[time=1567] he said to the paralytic, "I tell you, get up, take your mat, and go home."
[time=1574] He got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of all of them.
[time=1580] This amazed everyone, and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this." I'd like to call this passage, "The day a lame man walked and strong men stumbled."
[time=1596] It's a one-act, one-scene drama that Mark is recounting for us.
[time=1603] I'd like to view it in three different segments as though the focus or the spotlight moves to three different points.
[time=1612] The first focus of attention is on the house, the crowd, and a unique event that takes place.
[time=1619] A little background to set center stage first.
[time=1623] Jesus has been quietly talking and recruiting the cycles to follow him.
[time=1630] His ministry has not been clandestine or surreptitious, but neither has it been open and apparent.
[time=1637] The words that he's been speaking have been to a small audience of chosen followers.
[time=1644] But suddenly, all of that changed.
[time=1648] Jesus went public with his stock.
[time=1650] He put his idea on the French shelf, exposed it to the entire world of his day.
[time=1656] But more than just taking his message public, he substantiated his message with a series of miracles
[time=1665] that caught the attention of the entire Palestinian world.
[time=1672] The crowd of people has been dogging Jesus day after day until finally
[time=1678] he has to slip away in chapter 1 verse 35 of Mark
[time=1684] to a mountain, to a quiet spot, to in our words to get away from it all.
[time=1691] Then Mark 2 picks it up with Jesus returning home to Capernaum, probably the home of Simon Peter.
[time=1699] He gets home and it's a turn back to the same old thing.
[time=1704] Word goes through that town rapidly.
[time=1708] Jesus is back.
[time=1709] He's at Peter's house.
[time=1710] The master is home.
[time=1711] Let's go hear what he has to say.
[time=1713] And the crowd of people gathered.
[time=1715] It swelled.
[time=1716] They went elbow to elbow.
[time=1718] They filled every part of that house and they started gathering outside the door.
[time=1724] Like a wedge behind the door as the line of people broadened as each would contort their bodies and strain their necks, trying to find a little area that they could see through.
[time=1736] What would Jesus say?
[time=1738] What would he do next?
[time=1742] A group of concerned men came.
[time=1744] How many we don't know, but four of the group were carrying one.
[time=1748] He was paralyzed.
[time=1750] He couldn't walk from the waist down.
[time=1753] He wanted to get him to Jesus.
[time=1755] They had heard about his miracles that had spread fast.
[time=1759] Maybe Jesus could heal their friend.
[time=1762] They got to the overcrowded house and were not deterred by the press.
[time=1768] They went up onto the roof and they began to dismantle the roof.
[time=1774] Down below, unsuspecting is this crowd of people hanging on Jesus every word.
[time=1781] The light was very dark because the bodies had opagged the windows in the door.
[time=1788] One man notices some debris falling and ceremoniously dusts himself off.
[time=1794] And then, like a piercing arrow, a ray of light comes into that darkened room.
[time=1800] As everyone turned to look up, suddenly a whole section of the roof is pulled back and the light floods in.
[time=1807] Sleeves and hands go up the shield, the eyes, that were only accustomed to the darkened room.
[time=1812] Slowly, their pupils adjusted to the new light and as they looked up,
[time=1818] there were four faces and four arms lowering a mat.
[time=1823] And as it came down lower, they saw a familiar man.
[time=1827] He was from their town.
[time=1829] They had seen him collecting coins outside the synagogue.
[time=1833] They all knew him. His paralyzed condition was familiar to them.
[time=1838] And this first focus ends with Jesus speaking to the man, shocking words, unpredictable words.
[time=1850] Jesus notices the man and the faith of the man and his friends and he looks at him
[time=1856] and he says, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
[time=1865] And with that, the entire focus of our narrative changes.
[time=1869] We're no longer viewing the man or Jesus, but now we are viewing part of the crowd.
[time=1877] It's in verse six, it says, "Now some teachers of the law were sitting there."
[time=1883] Luke, who also tells this story, gives us a little bit more detail.
[time=1888] Luke said there were Pharisees from every town in Galilee, that was the northern territory,
[time=1896] and from Judea, that's the southern territory, and from Jerusalem, that's the capital where it all happens.
[time=1903] They had been recipients of the rumors that there was a miracle worker, a prophet,
[time=1910] a Jesus who had captured the imagination of their countrymen, and they were there to check it out.
[time=1918] These men were probably not open-minded seekers or heartfelt searchers.
[time=1924] They were probably antagonistic skeptics who were sent on a scouting mission from the Sanhedrin, the Supreme Court of that day.
[time=1933] But they don't say a word, but they're thinking, and they're all thinking the same thing.
[time=1942] Their reasoning follows these three points.
[time=1946] One, why does this fellow talk like this?
[time=1951] That was not a debate of dialect, why isn't he speaking Hebrew, and why does he use Aramaic,
[time=1957] or why does he use such small words when we have precise theological terms?
[time=1962] No, it wasn't a matter of linguistics.
[time=1968] Their second reasoning was he is blaspheming, and their third is the conclusion of the two.
[time=1977] Why does he speak like this?
[time=1979] His blaspheming conclusion is, who can forgive sins but God alone?
[time=1989] And so the second focus of this one-act drama is on the religious leaders of that day.
[time=1995] It probably conspicuous.
[time=1997] They wore their ceremonial robes so that everyone would know that they were somebody.
[time=2002] They probably even worked their way with an official gesture to the front of the crowd.
[time=2008] And there you could see their pondering gestures, their scowling eyes, their raised eyebrows as they heard something for which they could bring a charge.
[time=2019] But then the focus shifts a second time to a third personality.
[time=2024] No longer the man on the mat or the Pharisees, but now on Jesus himself, and he begins to speak.
[time=2032] His first words are, why do you reason these things in your heart?
[time=2039] Secondly, he said, why does it make a difference?
[time=2043] What's easier to say?
[time=2045] On the one hand, your sins be forgiven, or on the other hand, rise, take up your mat and walk,
[time=2053] which is easier to say.
[time=2056] Well, this was no debate over the economy of words.
[time=2059] Each of them were equally as easy to speak in terms of vocabulary.
[time=2063] But neither of them was easy to say in terms of reality.
[time=2069] Because you see, for someone to say your sins are forgiven, that takes God.
[time=2077] Only God can forgive sins.
[time=2080] It makes no sense for a man to say, I forgive you of your sins.
[time=2084] Think of it in these logical terms today.
[time=2087] Suppose you owe Fred $500.
[time=2092] And I walk up and I say, your debt's forgiven.
[time=2096] What do I have to do with it?
[time=2098] Your debt is to Fred, not to me.
[time=2103] How can Jesus say your sins are forgiven?
[time=2106] Your debt of sin is to God, not to anyone else.
[time=2112] So that was a hard thing for Jesus to say.
[time=2115] But he said, is that any harder to say than to say to this man who is paralyzed, incapable of walking?
[time=2123] Hey, get up, roll up that straw mat, tuck it under your arm and head for home.
[time=2130] He couldn't do that either.
[time=2133] That too would require God.
[time=2136] No man can say your sins are forgiven, and no one can say, rise up and walk.
[time=2144] Then Jesus makes a third statement.
[time=2148] He said, but so that you can know that the Son of Man has power to forgive sins.
[time=2157] He looked at the paralytic and said, I say to you, take up your mat and walk.
[time=2164] And he did it.
[time=2168] Now that was a strategic move on Jesus' part.
[time=2172] It was strategic in this way.
[time=2174] For him to pronounce the man forgiven of his sins was totally internal and subjective.
[time=2181] It was impossible to attest that or to document it.
[time=2187] If the man said, I feel wonderful, I feel clean on the inside, I just feel great.
[time=2194] People would walk out and sit at psychosomatic.
[time=2197] He came in here with an emotional burden. Jesus gave him a few triggered words, and now the man feels better about himself.
[time=2204] It's nothing more than hype talk.
[time=2207] But for Jesus to take a man, who everybody in that town knew, who they had chipped in a few coins to help him make it through a day,
[time=2217] they could observe the withered conditions of those limbs paralyzed over the years, the atrophy of muscle tissue,
[time=2226] the weakness of joints.
[time=2228] And Jesus said, hey, get up.
[time=2232] Take your mat and go home.
[time=2234] When he arose and they saw those feeble members function, it was an undeniable miracle.
[time=2242] And Jesus strategically linked that man's physical healing to that man's spiritual forgiveness
[time=2251] because it was a provable, authentic, documentable miracle that not even the critics of his day could deny.
[time=2264] When the scene closes, one more person walks out of that house than walked into it, a lame man.
[time=2274] But on the way out, a group of strong, educated, religious leaders stumbled over the issue, who is this Jesus.
[time=2288] I'd like to boil this down to three things that you can take home.
[time=2294] The first is this one. As you read the passage here, all of humanity is represented.
[time=2304] The concerned, the complacent, and the critical.
[time=2310] Let me move through those groups one at a time.
[time=2313] First of all, there are concerned people.
[time=2316] These men had a friend.
[time=2319] They had helped him many times before.
[time=2322] He couldn't make his way to the door of the synagogue, and they probably had carried him there on a regular basis.
[time=2328] That was where his best luck would be found as a beggar.
[time=2334] Society didn't have disability insurance.
[time=2337] The government did not provide welfare.
[time=2340] He could not collect his parents' social security.
[time=2343] Unemployment was not a benefit of that province.
[time=2349] How would he make his living? No doubt as a beggar.
[time=2354] He would sit by the common crossroads, the main streets, the marketplaces, but his best luck would be at the synagogue.
[time=2362] That's where the most compassionate people would come and toss in a few coins.
[time=2367] Even if they weren't compassionate, they wanted to be known as social do-gooders, so they would toss them in for an altruistic motive.
[time=2376] He had friends. They had carried him from place to place before.
[time=2382] Now, these friends had heard something unusual.
[time=2385] They had heard of a miracle worker.
[time=2388] Rumors like that had filtered through Palestine before, but never with the frequency or the intenseness of these miracles.
[time=2397] And they said, "We've got to get our friend to Jesus." A group of them, how many we don't know, but four of them each grab a corner of a mat, and they start carrying him to the home.
[time=2411] When they get to the home, they can see at first sight that it's a packed crowd.
[time=2417] The house is filled, the doorway is jammed, there are heads peeking through the window, and they're trying to get a group of them through, not a chance.
[time=2427] This group was not going to be discouraged. They were dauntless.
[time=2431] They found a way up onto the roof.
[time=2434] A lot of the old Palestinian houses have that day had an exterior stairway to go up on the roof.
[time=2440] It was a place for a sunbathing, to be quite honest.
[time=2444] Maybe the house was so equipped.
[time=2446] Maybe they had to resort to some more primitive means, but by huffing and puffing one way or the other, they got up on the roof and they got the mat and the man on it there as well.
[time=2456] Rooms in that day, in that land, were made out of straw and mud.
[time=2462] When the mud dried, it formed a crude form of mortar, and these bunches of mud-baked straw would be placed over cross members of wood, and a roof would be made.
[time=2476] These people went up on the roof, and they began dismantling the roof.
[time=2482] A piece at a time. A piece at a time. A debris was falling below.
[time=2487] Finally, they had exposed enough of the roof that they could lower the man on the mat down right in front of Jesus.
[time=2495] You have to give them credit for ingenuity and determination.
[time=2500] They were going to get their friend to Jesus, and I think somehow they worked their way to the front of the line.
[time=2508] When Jesus sees it, he has moved with love and with compassion, and he heals the man because he was amazed at their faith.
[time=2519] Not just the faith of the man on the mat, but of their faith. The faith of these concerned people.
[time=2527] An excellent Bible writer by the name of Donald Gray Barnhouse penned these words. Allow me to share them with you.
[time=2535] What these men had to do, let their friend down through a hole in the roof, was inconvenient.
[time=2545] But they did it. It was unconventional, but they did it. It destroyed some property, but they did it.
[time=2558] It may have caused bits of debris to fall on the notables, but they did it.
[time=2567] They weren't stopped by the difficulties. Their friend was in need and had to be brought face-to-face with Jesus Christ.
[time=2576] And when Jesus saw them, he acted immediately in his love and in his power.
[time=2585] Barnhouse goes on to make this application. We all have a tremendous obligation to bring our needy loved ones into the presence of Jesus.
[time=2595] There are difficulties, to be sure. But what is the purpose of difficulties? To test our faith and thereby increase it.
[time=2604] When we see barriers, as these men did. We should not say, "Avidently, this is not the Lord's will."
[time=2612] We must reject the pitistical, mystical way of folding our hands and saying, "Well, the Holy Spirit knows what He's doing."
[time=2622] The Holy Spirit expects us to get up and go.
[time=2628] That's one of the three groups of humanity that were there.
[time=2631] The concerned men that weren't going to be stopped until they accomplished their goal of face-to-face bringing their friend to Christ.
[time=2640] The second group of people there were the complacent.
[time=2644] The majority of the crowd were only casual spectators, bored women and men with time on their hands,
[time=2652] and coming to look for a sign of excitement, an assortment of masses, curious ambulance chasers, groupies, hecklers and do-gooders.
[time=2667] They all wanted to see what was happening in their town.
[time=2673] But most of them left with great amazement. They marveled. They even left saying, "We've never seen anything like this before."
[time=2684] Wow! That was quite a show. But they also left unconverted.
[time=2693] You see, this is the town of Capernaum. This is the city that was the recipient of more authentic miracles of Christ than most of the others of the New Testament.
[time=2702] And yet by the time Jesus' ministry draws to its midpoint, in Matthew chapter 11, Jesus has some harsh words to say about this complacent city and the crowd that gathered in this home.
[time=2717] Here's what he said, "Thou Capernaum, which is exalted into heaven, shall be brought down to hell.
[time=2728] For the mighty works which had been done and thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
[time=2737] But I say unto you that it shall be far more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee."
[time=2749] Impressed? You bet they were. They were impressed right out of their sandals, but not out of the complacency of their heart.
[time=2760] They liked the show. They liked what it did for business that outsiders were coming to town.
[time=2767] But they remained unmoved in their hearts, unconverted in their spirits, indifferent at best.
[time=2778] The third group of people who are here are the critical. They were the religious intelligentsia of the day.
[time=2789] They were scribes, men who had given their life to knowing the Old Testament.
[time=2794] They knew every one of the 623 commands of the Old Testament. They had categorized them and expanded upon them.
[time=2805] They not only said one of the laws was you couldn't work on a Sabbath, but they decided what was work and what wasn't.
[time=2813] They decided how far you could walk and remain in honor of the Sabbath and how far if you walked you broke the Sabbath.
[time=2820] They were the jot and tittle detail men of the day.
[time=2826] And they came not as seekers, not as searchers, but as adversaries, hostile.
[time=2834] They stood in their robes with a critical eye watching every move of Jesus and listening to every word he spoke to discern if there was anything out of orthodoxy.
[time=2849] For which they could find fault.
[time=2853] And Jesus surpassed their greatest expectation.
[time=2857] I mean wait till they get back to the Sanhedrin. Wait till those men here that Jesus said your sins are forgiven.
[time=2864] We've got him on blasphemy. This will be one less problem for us.
[time=2871] They were professional fault finders and they thought they had found fault in Jesus.
[time=2877] They thought this man was guilty of blasphemy because he put himself at parity with God and only God can forgive sins.
[time=2888] All of humanity is represented here. The concerned, the complacent and the critical.
[time=2897] Some of us here today are concerned. We're concerned for our own spiritual lives. We want to know if Jesus is real.
[time=2906] We want to know can he make a difference in my life.
[time=2910] Some of us here are searchers, seekers, explorers.
[time=2916] Some of us here have already come to the end of that quest and we've given our heart to Christ.
[time=2921] And we're still concerned. We want to know his will for our lives.
[time=2924] We want to know how we can live that will please him. How does he want me to think on issues?
[time=2930] How does he want me to use my words as I talk to people?
[time=2934] How does he want me to order my steps, my walk?
[time=2938] We're concerned spiritually. We want to please him.
[time=2942] Some of us here are concerned not just about knowing Christ ourselves and following him as Lord,
[time=2948] but we're concerned about the rest of this body and about our friends in the community.
[time=2953] We want them to come to know Christ. We want to carry them somehow, somehow, some way into the presence of Christ. Some of us here are the concerned.
[time=2967] But others of us here, probably the majority are the complacent.
[time=2974] We're here because everybody's got to be someplace.
[time=2980] And we came here because our spouse wanted us to. We're called draggies.
[time=2985] We were drug here somewhat unwillingly.
[time=2988] Others of us are here because we've always heard that it's a good thing to go to church.
[time=2993] While we're not all that interested in God, he's not somebody I'd personally like to offend either.
[time=2998] So if he'd like me to come to church, I'll put in an hour.
[time=3002] I hope it's not longer than that.
[time=3005] Others of us, we've given our lives to Christ.
[time=3009] It's kind of a lesson in history for us to go back and think about it.
[time=3013] And over the years we've grown somewhat cold.
[time=3018] We've grown somewhat indifferent. We're complacent.
[time=3023] The songs are too familiar. The environment too predictable.
[time=3029] The messages all seem to sound the same.
[time=3033] We're here only because the winds of tradition have blown us into this auditorium.
[time=3041] Some of us here are the critical.
[time=3044] Some of us are here, and what we're looking for is a flaw in the preacher's logic.
[time=3050] You don't have to stick around long. You'll find plenty of those.
[time=3054] Others of us here are critical. We're looking at each person here and saying, "I know her. She's no better than I am." I don't need to do anything spiritual. I know him.
[time=3067] If he's a Christian, I'll just chuck the whole thing.
[time=3071] We're here to find faults.
[time=3073] It's a spiritual defense mechanism that says, "If I can find something wrong with this church, or if I can find something wrong with Christianity, or Christians, then you can't touch me. I'm safe."
[time=3088] Others of us aren't critical in that way. We've already come to Christ.
[time=3095] But over the years, we've grown bitter.
[time=3100] Our first reaction is to be critical. Our instincts are to find faults.
[time=3106] We say, "Hm, didn't we just hear that song a year ago? Why didn't he sing something different?"
[time=3114] Church again. I know what they're going to do.
[time=3117] The choir is going to open. We're going to sing a hymn.
[time=3119] Somebody's going to pray. We'll sing to your choruses.
[time=3121] Rick will stand up there and say, "Welcome to Blackhawk. Then the choir, it's all." And suddenly you find yourself finding fault, being critical.
[time=3132] It's a matter of the heart, not of the world around you.
[time=3137] Some of you cannot be pleased.
[time=3140] Your boss cannot please you, and neither can your employees.
[time=3145] Your spouse has disappointed you. Your children have embarrassed you.
[time=3151] And all you see is the shortcomings and the faults.
[time=3157] Remember this. I forget who said it, but it is truly worth our notice.
[time=3164] Remember, in the history of mankind, never yet has a monument been erected in honor of a critic.
[time=3176] Three groups of humanity, the concerned, the complacent, and the critical.
[time=3182] Would you answer in your own heart this probing question, ask yourself into which of these three groups do I fit?
[time=3193] Let me give you a second thing to take home, to think about.
[time=3197] It is this one.
[time=3199] The greatest need in life is not physical healing, but spiritual forgiveness.
[time=3207] Now I don't want to be insensitive. You can't say to a man who is hungry and famished.
[time=3212] Here are two tickets to the Philharmonic. I hope you have a good time.
[time=3216] First of all, he's probably not real tuned to music and secondly, the price of refreshments there are high.
[time=3223] Now you've got to start off where people live. Abraham Maslow created a pyramid of needs.
[time=3230] At the base of the pyramid, he's met physical needs.
[time=3234] And at the top of it, he put self-actualization.
[time=3237] Overall, it's a very good illustration of the needs of humanity, but there is a slice that goes from top to bottom
[time=3245] that Maslow missed.
[time=3247] And that is the need of the spirit of a man and the soul of a woman to know forgiveness.
[time=3255] When Jesus saw this paralyzed man, his eyes could detect the withered limbs.
[time=3260] He could see the anticipation on faces that held the stretcher.
[time=3265] But what he saw was far deeper and far more probing. He saw a broken heart.
[time=3270] He saw a life that had been marked by sin and he gave it its greatest need.
[time=3276] Your sins are forgiven.
[time=3278] Aroniously, the people of that day thought that any physical problem was the result of sin.
[time=3284] In John chapter 9, a blind man was brought to Jesus and they asked him this.
[time=3289] Who sinned this man or his mother that he should be born this way?
[time=3293] Jesus corrected centuries of erroneous theology with one word when he said neither.
[time=3299] But this was done that you might see the glory of God and he healed the man.
[time=3304] Beyond our physical needs, our need for more or better is our need for forgiveness.
[time=3313] The third and final thing that I would suggest that we take home is this one.
[time=3318] Jesus in this passage is revealed as God, the healer of your soul.
[time=3327] There are three revelations of Jesus' deity in this passage.
[time=3332] The first one is when he calls himself the son of man.
[time=3335] He says this is done so that you'll know the son of man has power to forgive sins.
[time=3340] You may be thinking as many skeptics do.
[time=3343] Doesn't that mean Jesus is just a man? He didn't call himself God.
[time=3347] He didn't even call himself the son of God.
[time=3350] But a closer examination reveals that Daniel chapter 7 verse 26 and 27
[time=3356] prophetically announced that the Messiah, when God would come as a man, he would be called the son of man.
[time=3362] And even an unbeliever who has given his life to refuting the Bible,
[time=3368] Hugh Schoenfield in his Passover plot said the son of man was the messianic title
[time=3375] most familiar to the people of northern Galilee.
[time=3379] You know what Capernaum is? Northern Galilee.
[time=3384] And Jesus used the word son of man because it would be the most familiar, most clear identification he could give that he was Messiah.
[time=3394] A second revelation is this, Jesus' omniscience.
[time=3399] The Pharisees hadn't said a word. And yet Jesus, being God, knew all.
[time=3406] And he knew what was in their minds.
[time=3411] That had to be troubling to them.
[time=3414] To think that Jesus could read minds.
[time=3419] He's omniscient.
[time=3421] And the third revelation is the most obvious.
[time=3424] In his omnipotence, he had all power. He could not only forgive sins, but he could make a man walk who was lame.
[time=3437] Jesus has revealed clearly here as God in the healer of your soul.
[time=3446] Jesus said that he could forgive sins.
[time=3451] There's not a one of us that shouldn't cash in on that offer.
[time=3455] Most of us can walk. Few of us really have need for physical healing.
[time=3460] Some would prefer that.
[time=3463] But the universal need today is for spiritual healing.
[time=3470] Everyone who walked into that room walked out with one additional,
[time=3476] a layman walked home that day. But unfortunately, some strong men stumbled on the threshold of that door.
[time=3484] Jesus is either the rock of our salvation, or he is the rock of the fence.
[time=3489] We will either step on him, and in so doing, step into eternity, or we will stumble over him, and by that, stumble past eternity.
[time=3506] [MUSIC]
[time=3512] We've been sharing with you the musical ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and soloists Kathy Hawks and Chris Bone.
[time=3519] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3522] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior and make him the light of your life, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3532] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3534] Dear Heavenly Father, you've come to be the light of the world and the salvation of men.
[time=3540] And today I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart and save me for Jesus' sake.
[time=3548] I thank you for this opportunity today to ask you into my heart.
[time=3553] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3557] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
