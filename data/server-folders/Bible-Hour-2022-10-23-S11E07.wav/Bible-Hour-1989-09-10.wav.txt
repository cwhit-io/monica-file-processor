[time=59] [MUSIC]
[time=72] >>Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks. Thank you for joining us.
[time=77] Rick's message today is entitled "A Woman Who Came a Stones Throw from Death." John 8 holds the familiar story of the woman caught in adultery. Her accusers stood ready to cast stones at her along with their words of condemnation.
[time=92] But then she met Jesus, the God of the Second Chance. Her life was changed never to be the same again.
[time=99] Today Rick plans to repaint this ancient story onto a modern canvas and frame it with four insights to take home.
[time=107] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of John.
[time=112] Rick's text is taken from verses 1 through 11.
[time=116] Special music today includes an instrumental duet from Dave and Debbie Johnson and a song from Celebration.
[time=125] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir and orchestra bring us a number entitled "Praise Him."
[time=133] [MUSIC]
[time=154] Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer! Sing over His wonderful love, obey!
[time=168] Hail, hear, hear, hear! I snare angels in glory, send their honor, give to His holy name!
[time=182] I love heaven, Jesus the Christ is children, give His arms, take praise Him all in all!
[time=197] Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him!
[time=208] [MUSIC]
[time=217] Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer!
[time=224] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=285] Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer! Happy love!
[time=298] [MUSIC]
[time=321] Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him!
[time=346] I love His excellence. Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him!
[time=374] [MUSIC]
[time=388] We come together today to worship the Lord and to praise Him for what He did before our existence, what He's doing for us now, and what He's promised to do for us in the future, with fellowship with Him for eternity.
[time=401] I know whom I have believed a great song of confirmation, Him number 409, and we'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together, 409.
[time=412] [MUSIC - 117 seconds]
[time=543] Thank you for that good singing. This song reminds me of yesterday afternoon when here in Fort Wayne we had quite a storm.
[time=550] As the storm came up I asked Carol where she was and I didn't hear from her and I went through the entire house and couldn't find her, forgetting that she had gone to pick up our son after a soccer game, but I thought maybe the rapture had come, but I'm here to tell you that if it happens I'm going to be in that rapture with the Lord Jesus if He chooses to take us that way.
[time=570] If not, we'll wait for His timing.
[time=573] We appreciate the ministry of David and Debbie Johnson, they've been gone from us for the summer,
[time=579] just came back last week and we do appreciate their ministry in our church and their testimony.
[time=584] Let's listen as they play for us right now. Rise up, O men of God.
[time=588] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=712] Hello again and thanks for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=717] I hope many of you had a chance to come last night for the Buddy Green concert.
[time=721] If you didn't we've got another special music concert coming up in just a few weeks.
[time=725] Rick, we had a good time last night, but we look forward to all the music that we're going to have this fall and throughout the year and October 15th we're going to have Bruce Greer here.
[time=734] Bruce is a pianist and he also is a fine arranger.
[time=737] As you recall, he wrote and arranged the song for our dedication of this building entitled "The Lord Rains."
[time=743] I do remember that. That is a powerful great hymn and when he's here, will we get to hear the choir sing it again?
[time=749] Yes, the choir is going to sing it, the orchestra will be playing it, we'll have a lot of music on Sunday morning and then Bruce will give a full concert that evening, October 15th at 7pm here in the worship center.
[time=759] I'm looking forward to that. That song "The Lord Rains" is so powerful and I remember loving it the first time I heard it.
[time=766] It is a really beautiful song. Just recently they used it for the entire state of Texas.
[time=772] He called and said about 400 singers and orchestras sang and it was quite a spectacle.
[time=778] Well, you'll want to make a special effort to join us on October 15th for the choir and orchestra and Bruce Greer in the morning service
[time=785] and then the evening service at 6 o'clock that Sunday night will be a full concert with Bruce Greer.
[time=791] Mark your calendar and save that date.
[time=794] This morning I want to encourage you to write to us for a booklet entitled "A Closer Walk."
[time=800] Isn't that what you would like to have with our Heavenly Father, "A Closer Walk"?
[time=805] You could begin the habit of a daily Bible study.
[time=808] This tool will guide you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=812] You could begin your morning with your cup of coffee and a quiet time with the Lord.
[time=817] Closer Walk will help you to establish that habit of a daily devotional so that you can draw closer to our Heavenly Father.
[time=825] We offer it to you right now because our year begins in October.
[time=830] We'll begin with the Book of Matthew and then go from October all the way around to next September ending with the Book of Revelation.
[time=837] If you'd like a copy, we encourage you to write for it today.
[time=841] You can receive a copy of "A Closer Walk" by writing to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=853] Once again, that's the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=862] Thank you, Pete, and we do hope you'll write.
[time=865] We'd love to hear how God is using this ministry in your life, but particularly want to send you a copy of "A Closer Walk"
[time=872] so that you can get started in Matthew chapter 1, verse 1, on October 1 and begin a new year of "A Closer Walk."
[time=880] Well, if you're in the Fort Wayne area, we want to suggest this challenge to you.
[time=884] It's probably somewhere around 7, 10 to 7, 15 in the morning as you're watching, and we want to encourage you to get up now, get dressed, and come out to Black Hawk and worship with us this morning.
[time=896] It's open house here at Black Hawk, and along with our morning worship service, Adult Sunday School program, we are having an open house.
[time=904] We'll open up this studio and the control room, and you'll be able to see behind the scenes how the Bible Hour is produced and brought into your home.
[time=913] We'll have the privilege of meeting face-to-face and greeting each other.
[time=916] We want to challenge you to get moving now at this early hour on Sunday morning, and if you don't have a church home, make Black Hawk your church home for at least today.
[time=926] Our church and our studio are located in the same building, our worship center, at 7,400 East State Boulevard.
[time=935] If you can find Coliseum Boulevard, take it to state, go east, about two and a half miles, just past the Georgetown Shopping Center, and Black Hawk Baptist Church is on both sides of the street, you can't miss it.
[time=949] The worship center is the larger building with the stained-girl-assed window and the cross at the very center.
[time=955] We hope you'll come today and join us for our open house.
[time=979] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning, our song.
[time=1007] Shall rise to thee, holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons as the tree.
[time=1037] Holy, holy, holy, all the saints are drawing, casting down their golden crown to them.
[time=1065] The glass is sealed, she'll open and set a thing, falling down before thee.
[time=1084] You are the modern world shall be here.
[time=1101] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
[time=1127] holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
[time=1148] holy, how are holy, there is not beside thee, perfect in glory, love and glory to me.
[time=1178] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=1235] You are the symbol and mighty, God in three persons as the tree.
[time=1253] Lord God on the tree, Lord God on the tree.
[time=1282] Lord God on the tree.
[time=1295] Our Father, we worship you today because you are holy and we echo the song that we have just heard with our ears.
[time=1304] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=1309] Early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee.
[time=1313] God, we have assembled in this place today to praise your name, for your character, for your unchanging countenance,
[time=1322] for your ways that are beyond finding out, for your impeccable character, your holiness, unmarked by sin.
[time=1331] We stand in awe, in amazement, in wonder, and we've come today through song, through study of the Scripture,
[time=1341] through our fellowship together to honor you.
[time=1345] We want to please you by the thoughts that our mind would hold, by the words that our tongues would speak,
[time=1353] by the glance of our countenance, by our nods of affirmation. We want to please you. We love you Lord.
[time=1362] On this first day of the week we wanted it to be our first priority to declare our allegiance to you and to meet with you in this place.
[time=1373] We ask you to meet with us. We ask you by your spirit to penetrate our hearts.
[time=1380] We ask you to take the heart of that friend today that is hard, that has become calloused by indifference,
[time=1387] or become brittle by sin, and softly caress it, and open it, and give it life.
[time=1398] We ask you to take that heart that is soft, that's even broken, and we ask you to heal it, to mend it, and restore it.
[time=1411] We ask you today to make this service not an hour of tradition, but indeed an hour of power.
[time=1420] We want to praise you today for the things you have done. We want to thank you for those who have come to Christ.
[time=1428] Men have prayed, mothers have prayed, children have prayed, and your spirit has worked in the life of their loved one who has come to faith.
[time=1439] We praise you. We praise you today that Greg Hindel's leukemia is in remission, and we would ask you to work through the ongoing therapy to give him a clean bill of health for life.
[time=1454] We would pray this morning for Amy Moore that you would work a miracle in her body, that you would give her life back to her, that Burkett's lymphoma would no defeat.
[time=1467] We would ask you to take charge, that the consequences of chemotherapy would be minimal on her body.
[time=1476] We ask you to hold a mother and a father steadfast as they must watch the devastating effects of what we hope will bring about recovery.
[time=1486] We pray for Judy McCoy's friend, Laura, that she might recover from a car accident.
[time=1493] We ask you to be glorified this morning, and what we pray about.
[time=1499] May we seek not our own will, but yours. And now as we open up your word, we open up our hearts to you, in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1512] Have you ever been caught red-handed? Lincoln Elementary School in Cowell, Ohio, where I spent some of the best years of my life, had high, high ceilings, at least ten foot, maybe twelve.
[time=1528] And to a fourth grader, that looked like the Empire State Building.
[time=1532] One of the things that we occasionally did was we'd go into the restroom, take those coarse paper towels, and soak them in the sink till they got real soggy.
[time=1541] And then if you throw them up just right, they would stick on the ceiling.
[time=1546] Well, just about the time we had the entire men's restroom ceremoniously decorated, I was ready to launch my last paper towel.
[time=1556] I got to this point, when in walked one of my best friends, Mr. Mitten, the principal of that school.
[time=1563] I tried a faking gesture and wiping my face. He was not to be deceived.
[time=1570] Particularly in dining was the towel that fell from the ceiling in front of him.
[time=1576] I was caught. Wet-handed.
[time=1579] Have you ever been caught red-handed? There was no getting off the hook.
[time=1584] If you have a Bible turned to John 8, you'll meet a woman who was caught, red-handed, in the scarlet sin of adultery.
[time=1594] John 8 verses 1 through 11 framed the biblical passage of our study today.
[time=1602] It reads like this, "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
[time=1607] At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts where all the people gathered around him.
[time=1614] And he sat down to teach them."
[time=1620] The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.
[time=1627] They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus.
[time=1633] Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
[time=1639] In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such a woman.
[time=1644] Now, what do you say?
[time=1649] They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
[time=1660] But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
[time=1669] When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,
[time=1676] "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."
[time=1687] Again, he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
[time=1693] At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time.
[time=1700] The older ones first until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.
[time=1710] Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they?
[time=1718] Has no one condemned you?" "No, sir," she said.
[time=1725] "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared.
[time=1730] "Go now and leave your life of sin."
[time=1738] This is a familiar story of the Bible, to be sure an ancient one.
[time=1743] Today, I want to attempt to repaint this ancient picture onto a modern canvas
[time=1751] and then frame it with four things that we can take home before we leave today.
[time=1757] But to begin the story, I need to give at least three points of background.
[time=1762] Allow me that.
[time=1763] First of all, there is what scholars would call a textual problem with this passage.
[time=1770] If you have a new international version, right before John chapter 7, verse 53,
[time=1776] there'll be a note something like this, the earliest and most reliable manuscripts
[time=1782] and other ancient witnesses do not have John 7, 53 through 8, 11.
[time=1789] What does that mean?
[time=1791] Well, it may be disappointing to those of you who believe the Bible to be God's word
[time=1797] and trust it thoroughly, as I do, to discover that in the Smithsonian Institute, there is not a copy of the Bible signed by Paul at the end of his epistles, Jude at the end of his.
[time=1809] No one has a copy that signed Moses at the end of the book of Exodus.
[time=1815] We don't have those original autographs.
[time=1820] However, please don't be discouraged.
[time=1822] Instead, what we have is in excess of 40,000 documents of parchment,
[time=1830] handwritten ancient documents that bring us pieces of the New Testament.
[time=1837] Then, papriologists piece these together with the highest of scientific calculations
[time=1844] to reproduce what we believe to be the New Testament.
[time=1848] It has been said by one scholar that the New Testament is 99.5% accurate to the original,
[time=1856] and that half a percent does not pertain to anything of substantial faith.
[time=1863] What this means is that of all these 40,000 plus documents of the New Testament,
[time=1869] the oldest ones and the earliest ones don't include the passage I've just read to you.
[time=1874] We don't find that passage until about documents dating to 600 AD, still fairly substantial and fairly old.
[time=1884] Here's what two of the finest papriologists, those are the biblical scientists
[time=1890] who piece together ancient documents have to say.
[time=1893] F.F. Bruce says of John chapter 8 verses 1 through 11, that it is a fragment of authentic gospel material.
[time=1902] Bruce Metzger calls it, quote, "This account has all the earmarks of historical veracity.
[time=1910] It's not coming to us from the oldest of manuscripts, but it is indeed coming to us as the words of Jesus and to be trusted." A second point of background is this.
[time=1922] This is all taking place the morning after a seven-day event called the Festival of Tabernacles.
[time=1930] In John chapter 7 verse 1, we discover Jesus is up in Galilee.
[time=1936] Verse 2 says, "But when the Jewish feast of tabernacles was near,
[time=1942] Jesus's brother said to him, 'You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.'" And then in verse 37 on the last, "And the greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and in a loud voice said, 'If anyone is thirsty, let them come unto me.'" Verse 53 of chapter 7 says, "When the festival was over, they each went to their own homes." The Feast of Tabernacles was a mandatory event for any able-bodied man 20 miles from Jerusalem.
[time=1977] He had to be there, and no complaints, it was a great time.
[time=1981] It was harvest time and in gathering feast.
[time=1985] The people came to Jerusalem, men almost exclusively, and they made booths, tabernacles.
[time=1994] They would use some sticks, some dried leaves, some palm branches, maybe some animal skins, some cloth, whatever they had, and in an empty lot on the corners, wherever there was space on a rooftop, they would put their little booth and they would live there for the seven days of the feast.
[time=2013] It was meant in part to commemorate the exodus where they lived in these same type of makeshift booths.
[time=2019] For those of you who went out, it was a lot like the Grable Fair.
[time=2024] There was just booth after booth after booth, not so much for the selling of crafts or of good, but a place to call home for a seven-day festival.
[time=2034] It was meant to be spiritual, it was meant to be highly religious, but time had corrupted it, and it, like many of our holidays of Thanksgiving and Christmas, became a point of celebration and then even degraded to a week-long bash.
[time=2051] Jesus has been there, he has spoken, and now what we read in John 8 is the last event, the morning after when everyone else is heading for home.
[time=2063] This woman is brought in before Jesus.
[time=2066] One third and final point of background before we dig into the story.
[time=2071] Hostility towards Jesus by the religious leaders of that day is in full swing.
[time=2079] In chapter five, verse 16, Jesus had acted on the Sabbath date,
[time=2085] which the scribes and Pharisees did not approve of, and then Jesus challenged their disapproval of saying, "Why do you question this? I work in my father in heaven works to this very day." And they became all the more indignant, and they determined at that point they were going to kill Jesus because he not only broke the Sabbath, but he made himself equal to God by calling God his father.
[time=2114] Jesus then heads north and he stays out of Judea, out of Jerusalem. Here's what chapter seven, verse one says.
[time=2124] After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because of the Jews.
[time=2131] Hostilities in full swing.
[time=2134] Now when Jesus does come back, he does come to the feast, and he stands up and makes an impassionate appeal for people to come unto him.
[time=2143] The Pharisees and the scribes send a temple guard to arrest him.
[time=2148] They want to sequester this man and silence him for good.
[time=2153] Here's what chapter seven, verse 45 says.
[time=2157] Finally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees who asked him, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
[time=2166] "No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards declared.
[time=2172] "You mean he has deceived you also," the Pharisees retorted.
[time=2177] "Has any of the rulers of the Pharisees believed in him?" "No, but this mob that knows nothing of the law," "Ah, there's a curse on them." They've tried a direct frontal assault.
[time=2191] They sent an armed guard to abduct him, but they couldn't.
[time=2197] A combination of the popularity in the eyes of the crowd and Jesus' words seem to flow with an authority that kept swords in their sheath and guards at bay.
[time=2213] A frontal assault has not worked, but maybe a subtle trap will.
[time=2219] And so into the popular court of the temple, in front of a crowd,
[time=2225] the religious leaders of that day come dragging in this woman, who they say was caught in the very act.
[time=2234] I would like to call this message a woman who came a stone's throw from death.
[time=2240] I borrow that from Nancy Harden, and I'd like to read to you her retelling of the story.
[time=2246] She writes so well, and with such empathy, it's worth our listening.
[time=2252] Harden writes, "There's really no indication that she was a prostitute by trade."
[time=2259] The text merely calls her a woman caught in adultery.
[time=2265] Not a harlot, not a prostitute.
[time=2269] It's doubtful that the Pharisees had fished her out of the local red light district.
[time=2274] In fact, I tend to think she was just a young woman who had given up her virtue too easily.
[time=2282] The text indicates she was guilty of adultery, so she was probably married.
[time=2287] Perhaps her husband was out of the country on business.
[time=2292] Maybe he was a merchant off-closing in a deal in Egypt or in Syria.
[time=2300] He may have been gone for weeks and still not do back for weeks more.
[time=2307] She was at home alone at one of the happiest times of the year.
[time=2314] Perhaps she with some friends went one night to a party.
[time=2317] They sang and danced into the late hours.
[time=2321] The mood was carefree.
[time=2323] Laughter came easily.
[time=2325] The wine flowed freely.
[time=2328] There she met a man who could take away her loneliness.
[time=2332] He was dark-eyed, young, handsome.
[time=2339] He was alone, having come to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast.
[time=2344] As they laughed and chatted through the dance, he persuaded her to leave the party with him.
[time=2350] To look for other parties, more entertainment.
[time=2354] For the first time in weeks, she felt attractive, energetic, happy.
[time=2363] They wound their way daily through the crowded streets, moving from café to café.
[time=2369] As the parties disbanded and the streets calmed down, they found themselves near the entrance of his festival booth.
[time=2379] Of course, we can only imagine what happened, but we do know that in the early morning hours they entered the world of their own intimate affair, surrounded by a curtain of darkness.
[time=2392] However, as daybreak burst over the hills of Jerusalem, there came with it, sudden exposure.
[time=2401] Passing through the cluttered streets on their way to the temple, a band of Pharisees and scribes spied the entwined couple through the loosely tied branches of the booth.
[time=2412] They grabbed the young woman from the embrace of her lover, startled and confused.
[time=2419] She clutched her garments to cover her nakedness.
[time=2423] She instinctively reached for the arm of her young man.
[time=2428] But he was gone.
[time=2432] How could he leave her alone?
[time=2436] She begged for mercy and repuried, but they dragged her from the shoulder into the streets.
[time=2442] She was exposed and vulnerable.
[time=2445] Where was he? He had whispered promises of love in her ear, but in a moment he was gone as false as his words.
[time=2454] Why had the religious leaders singled her out in the carnival crowd?
[time=2460] If they wanted to clean up immorality in the city, why didn't they start with some of the better-known brothels or some of the booths near the ones she was in?
[time=2468] Why her?
[time=2471] What would become of her now?
[time=2474] How could she face her husband?
[time=2477] What would she say to him?
[time=2480] Oh, why had she given herself to someone else in the first place?
[time=2486] She felt cheap and rejected, destroyed.
[time=2493] The religious leaders only aggravated her guilt.
[time=2499] Nancy Harden certainly writes well.
[time=2502] It's impossible not to picture that scene with empathy.
[time=2506] And yet it's not such an ancient scene.
[time=2508] Suppose we retell the same story, but instead of it being Jerusalem, it's Fort Wayne.
[time=2515] Instead of it being a festival of the tabernacle, let's call it the Three Rivers Festival.
[time=2522] And instead of a makeshift booth, make it a conversion van, complete with curtains on all windows.
[time=2530] Instead of making it a hostile religious crowd, how about a jeering crowd in the office work room?
[time=2538] Instead of stones that are ready to be hurled, how about just words of condemnation?
[time=2545] It's not so foreign.
[time=2547] It's not so ancient.
[time=2549] Except for the times and the places, it's as contemporary as life today.
[time=2555] Well, that in many ways is speculation.
[time=2559] Others suggest that the Pharisees were not the benefactors of good fortune.
[time=2564] They just didn't happen to see this woman.
[time=2567] Others suggest that she was the victim of a plot, and this was just Act 1.
[time=2574] Here's what Chuck Swindall says.
[time=2576] These scribes and Pharisees are the religious leaders bent on destroying Jesus, who poses a threat to their religious oligarchy.
[time=2585] Jesus stops teaching.
[time=2587] He stares at the men whose voices have been honed in on hate.
[time=2592] A quick glance at verse 6 reveals they were acting out a plot that has been rehearsed down to the last detail.
[time=2599] A plot so insidious that they are willing to entrap and execute a woman in order to discredit Jesus.
[time=2609] They come in.
[time=2611] With them dragging like a squirming dog on a leash, a disheveled woman hastily clothed barefoot and humiliated.
[time=2621] A woman they testify caught in the very act of adultery.
[time=2627] A woman taken abruptly from the bedroom where she was some man's sexual object
[time=2633] and insensively dragged into the temple where she becomes a political object used to bait a trap for Jesus.
[time=2642] Where is the guilty man?
[time=2645] The accusers testify that the woman was caught in the act, so certainly they had equal opportunity to apprehend the man.
[time=2653] As the pieces of this sword puzzle begin to fall into place, it is obvious that the scribes and Pharisees did not merely happen by the bedroom window of two clandestine lovers.
[time=2666] No, the incidents smacked suspiciously a premeditated trap.
[time=2674] Before they could land their trophy fish, they had to first dip their minnow net into the shallows to get their bait.
[time=2683] Having caught her, they now hoped to hook Jesus on the barbs of a dilemma.
[time=2690] Whatever happened, whether the Pharisees entrapped this woman as a way of getting to Jesus or whether they found her on the way to the temple, there is a dilemma.
[time=2702] Jesus' dilemma is this.
[time=2705] If he on the one hand looks at this woman and says, "You caught her in the very act, you've quoted the law and said, "Stoner, and stoner, he will lose his reputation as a friend of the people, the friend of publicans and sinners."
[time=2726] Furthermore, he will be at odds with the Romans because the Romans will reserve the right to be the sole executors of capital punishment.
[time=2737] He cannot say, "Stoner." But if on the other hand he looks at her, he sees her embarrassment, he sees her humiliation, and his heart moves with compassion.
[time=2750] Suppose he even sees that she's been trapped and tricked for the purpose of enticing his words.
[time=2759] And out of compassion he says, "Let her go." Then he's going to be viewed as soft on sin.
[time=2767] And at odds, not with the Romans, but with Moses, for the law had strictly commanded she was to be executed.
[time=2775] It was a dilemma, an unsolvable dilemma, so it appears.
[time=2783] Jesus' decision takes three stages.
[time=2789] Stage one, Jesus walks over and he bends down and with his fingers he begins to write in the sand.
[time=2801] We don't know for sure what he wrote there.
[time=2804] Some have suggested that he moved away and bent down to take every eye off of the woman and put it on himself.
[time=2812] Other suggest that Jesus didn't know how to get out of the trap and he was buying a little time.
[time=2818] The suggestion that I like best is this one.
[time=2821] Jesus bent down and he began to write sins in the dirt.
[time=2828] Not her sins, but theirs.
[time=2832] He wrote pride.
[time=2836] He wrote entrapment.
[time=2839] He wrote insensitivity.
[time=2842] He wrote lust.
[time=2846] While he was down, they repeated the question and he kept on writing.
[time=2854] The second stage of Jesus' answer is when he rises and he speaks.
[time=2861] The law said that when a public execution took place that those were the witnesses or to be the first ones to cast the stones.
[time=2872] This group here was a lynch mob.
[time=2876] They knew what street a hanger from and they had brought their rope.
[time=2882] In their hands they carried with them their stones.
[time=2886] They were ready.
[time=2888] This was no charade.
[time=2890] They had stone people before and they'd be happy to do it today.
[time=2895] Gripping tightly in their arms was the ammunition to carry out their sentence.
[time=2902] Jesus speaks his words.
[time=2907] He said, "Let the one of you who was without sin cast the first stone."
[time=2915] William Barkley suggested our phrase without sin not only means without the act of sin but without the desire to sin.
[time=2927] Upon hearing those words, cocked arms began to drop, clenched fist released stones.
[time=2937] John insightfully adds that they left beginning with the older to the younger.
[time=2947] Jesus had caught them in their own trap.
[time=2953] The third thing that Jesus' decision includes is an address to the lady.
[time=2959] He had not passed judgment on the woman but he had passed judgment on the judges.
[time=2965] Now he turns to her, the defendant, and he says to her, "Where are your accusers?
[time=2974] Where are those who brought you here?
[time=2977] Where's the mob?" And she said, "No one condemns me, sir." And Jesus said, "Neither do I go now and sin no more."
[time=2993] Don't misunderstand this.
[time=2995] This is not an acquittal.
[time=2997] He has not ignored the fact of her sin.
[time=3000] He is not declaring her innocent.
[time=3003] Instead, he is offering her a pardon and a lifelong parole to sin no more.
[time=3013] Allow me to frame this now with four insights to take home.
[time=3019] The first one is this.
[time=3023] Compassion is the right response to wrong.
[time=3031] They were interested in destroying her.
[time=3034] Jesus was interested in restoring her.
[time=3039] Jesus saw her and the hundreds of others like her.
[time=3044] His heart was always first moved with compassion.
[time=3050] Somehow we have to find a way of being tough on sin and tender toward sinners.
[time=3058] It's not easy.
[time=3060] We're really not speaking out of both sides of our mouth when we, on the one hand, say, "God hates sin.
[time=3067] Don't do it." And on the other hand, we said, "If you do, come to God.
[time=3075] He loves you.
[time=3077] He is capable of being tough on sin and tender on sinners."
[time=3084] A second insight that I would suggest to us is this one.
[time=3088] Forgiveness and repentance are inseparably linked.
[time=3094] And you cannot have the one with the out the other.
[time=3098] Some of us have purposefully presumed upon the grace of God.
[time=3104] We have come to him in prayer and we have said, "God, I'm sorry." In reality, we're sorry that we are caught and we are sorry that there are consequences.
[time=3113] And we've said, "God, will you please forgive me?" When in our heart of hearts we know that we have no intention on repentance.
[time=3124] We plan to return again to the same points.
[time=3131] Some of us here have presumed upon the grace of our family and friends.
[time=3137] We have used false guilt as a lever to manipulate others into accepting us when we're unaccepting.
[time=3147] We have said to them, "I'm sorry.
[time=3149] I was wrong." We've obligated them to forgive us when they know and we know.
[time=3155] We have no intention of changing.
[time=3160] The offense and the plea for forgiveness will reoccur again and again as certain as the tide returns to the beach.
[time=3171] Here and always, forgiveness and repentance are inseparably linked.
[time=3179] You cannot have God's forgiveness if he cannot have your repentance.
[time=3187] The third insight that I would share with you is this one.
[time=3191] We are all a stone's throw away from death.
[time=3197] That's not to say we all have committed adultery, but there is a different stone for each sin.
[time=3204] The Bible makes it abundantly clear in the Old Testament, the soul that sins, it shall die.
[time=3210] The New Testament echoes the wages of sin is death.
[time=3216] The prophet Habakkah speaks of God and says, "Thou art of pureer eyes, O Lord, than to look upon sin are to behold iniquity."
[time=3227] Apart from Christ, we are all a stone's throw away from death.
[time=3236] A fourth and final insight I would share to frame this modern painting is our God, is the God of the Second Chance.
[time=3251] Baseball knows three strikes before you're out.
[time=3254] The scribes and the Pharisees only knew one and they were ready to launch their stones.
[time=3261] But our God is a God of forgiveness. Please don't presume upon his grace.
[time=3266] Please don't ask his forgiveness apart from repentance, but if you are willing to repent, he is willing to forgive and to give you a whole new life.
[time=3279] This woman was a stone's throw from death.
[time=3284] It was over, and just as quickly as it was over, life began again.
[time=3290] This time she began it not only with the freedom from her accusers, but she began it with the freedom of her own conscience, that Jesus had come into her life, and she would never be the same again.
[time=3310] Jesus Christ can come into your life. He can forgive you of whatever sin may be labeled on your stone and give you new life.
[time=3322] If there's anything to praise God for, if there's anything to be excited about, is as our God gives a second chance.
[time=3332] We praise him the Almighty for what he has done. He has given us new life in his Son.
[time=3355] He's united in his family, making us one. Let us praise him for what he has done.
[time=3366] Let us praise the Almighty for what he has done. He has given new life through the Son.
[time=3372] He's united in his family, making us one. Let us praise him for what he has done.
[time=3378] Let us praise the Almighty for what he has done. He has given new life through the Son.
[time=3398] He's united in his family, making us one. Let us praise him for what he has done.
[time=3417] Let us praise him for what he has done. Let us praise him for what he has done.
[time=3426] Let us praise him for what he has done.
[time=3456] It's been our joy today to share with you the music of our sanctuary choir and orchestra,
[time=3462] instrumentalist Dave and Debbie Johnson and celebration. The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3468] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, just before we close I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3478] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3485] And today I know that I have a need for Christ to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3490] And I ask you to do that today and be my Savior and cleanse my heart. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3499] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3503] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
