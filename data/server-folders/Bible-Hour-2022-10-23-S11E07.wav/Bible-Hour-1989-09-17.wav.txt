[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - The one who dies with the most toys does not necessarily win.
[time=36] He is only dead.
[time=38] And Jesus said, "If we want to go to Heaven, we must do this."
[time=44] [MUSIC - 9 seconds]
[time=57] - Welcome to an hour of Bible Studies for a Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=63] Thank you for joining us.
[time=65] Rick's message today is entitled "A Young Urban Professional Who Couldn't Part With His Toys." A popular bumper sticker says the one who dies with the most toys wins.
[time=76] Today's affluent society disproves that, though.
[time=79] While we are the wealthiest nation on the earth, we are also the unhappiest.
[time=83] Jesus taught that life does not consist of the abundance of the things that a man possesses.
[time=88] Rick's message today addresses that very point and has the title "A Young Urban Professional Who Couldn't Part With His Toys." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Mark chapter 10.
[time=101] Rick's text is taken from verses 17 through 22.
[time=106] Our special music today includes a duet from Marcia Richard and Marilyn Wong and two songs from the Men's Singers Quartet.
[time=116] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a number entitled, "Holy Is He."
[time=124] [MUSIC - 231 seconds]
[time=360] and from human person and praise. Holy is He. Holy is He. Holy is He.
[time=390] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty. All I worship raise thy name, deliver thy sin and sing. Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[time=419] O Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[time=446] Lord of the Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy. Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[time=474] O Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy.
[time=492] Let there be prayer. Amen. Amen.
[time=521] Praise you, the Father, for His loving kindness, tenderly He cares for His airing children. Great song of comfort as we sing together now 264.
[time=537] Him number 264 continuing to praise the holiness of the Trinity 264.
[time=561] Praise you, the Father, for His loving kindness, tenderly He cares for His every children. Praise you, the angels. Praise you, the brothers.
[time=561] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 84 seconds] Praise you, the Father, for His loving kindness, tenderly He cares for His every children. Praise yo...
[time=670] Thank you very much for your active participation. As you sang with us, we appreciate that very much.
[time=675] We were blessed in the first hour with our special music and in particular Marilyn Wong and Marsha Richards sisters as they sang together and ministered to us about the peace that only God can give.
[time=687] Let's listen to Him as they sing right now.
[time=715] Praise you, the Savior. Praise you, the Savior. Praise you, the Savior. Praise you, the Savior.
[time=715] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 124 seconds] Praise you, the Savior. Praise you, the Savior. Praise you, the Savior. Praise you, the Savior....
[time=858] He is our peace, He is our peace,
[time=888] He is our peace, He has broken down every wall, He is our peace,
[time=935] He is our peace, He has all your cares of Him, or He cares for you, He is our peace,
[time=975] He is our peace, He is our peace, He is our peace, He is our peace,
[time=1413] God, we don't want to make choices on a whim, on mere human insight, we want principles from your
[time=1420] word and direction from your spirit, we want to see the light. Father, we would pray that you would
[time=1427] shine the light of encouragement on those who are walking through tough times for those who are
[time=1434] unemployed or underemployed, for those who have been misunderstood and are the victims of a lawsuit
[time=1442] or disagreement or rejection. We'd ask you to shine the light of encouragement into the heart of those
[time=1449] who are walking through hard valleys for those who have sat by the bedside of those they love
[time=1456] and waited. We pray today for Wayne and Debbie Moore and most of all for Little Amy that your
[time=1465] light would touch your body, that you would recover from Burkett's Slim Foma, that you would encourage
[time=1471] your mother and a father and sisters as they wait. We thank you that Kay Benzinger is improving and
[time=1478] Greg Hindle is in recession from leukemia. We'd ask you to encourage that family as they go through
[time=1485] the preventative chemotherapy. We pray for Kim Eastland that you would give doctors wisdom
[time=1493] that her jaw would give her freedom from pain. Father, we pray that you would shine down the light
[time=1500] on us by way of insight today. Insight for living. Help us today to see beyond history and beyond
[time=1509] contemporary affairs and to see timeless principles that govern the universe and most of all to see
[time=1516] you, the governor. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1546] To inherit his grace, all glory and praise shall rest upon him. So will he to die in my place.
[time=1576] And I believe, Lord, for the past that he had. I would glory in the place.
[time=1606] My trophies and crowns, my robe stained with sin,
[time=1620] it was all that I had to lay at his feet, unworthy to eat from the table of life,
[time=1639] to love a provision for me. I will go free in the process of the past,
[time=1658] just as so free, I will be in pain. I will win the war for the past that he had.
[time=1678] I will glory in the cross. In the cross, I will win the war for the cross that he wore.
[time=1697] I will glory in the cross.
[time=1714] Thank you, men. If you brought a Bible with you today, I invite you to open it
[time=1725] to Mark chapter 10. Mark is the second book of the New Testament. Matthew being the first,
[time=1732] Mark is a second gospel that tells us about the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. In Mark chapter 10,
[time=1739] verses 17 through 22, it tells us of an encounter that Jesus and another individual had. I would
[time=1748] like to read that passage for you right now, Mark 10, 17. As Jesus started on his way,
[time=1756] a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked,
[time=1764] "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Why do you call me good? Jesus answered,
[time=1773] "No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments. Do not murder. Do not commit
[time=1780] adultery. Do not steal. Do not give false testimony. Do not defraud. Honor your father and mother.
[time=1786] Teacher," he declared, "all these things I have kept since I was a boy."
[time=1792] Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said,
[time=1802] "go so everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven.
[time=1809] Then come follow me." At this, the man's face fell. He went away sad because he had great wealth.
[time=1822] We make a serious error in calculation. If we see this individual as only a historic figure,
[time=1832] a nameless personality out of the past. He is not such. He is timeless. He is trans-cultural.
[time=1840] And if he should go through a quantum leap in 2,000 years of time, we would suddenly discover
[time=1846] he is one of us. He laughs like us. He loves like us. He lives like us. And he even looks like us.
[time=1860] Night's time. The people who met Jesus were real people. They weren't fictitious characters out
[time=1870] of the past, though sometimes they were anonymous. But they were certainly real. And the issues of
[time=1876] life over which they struggled are the same issues in life to which we give our quest.
[time=1885] This was a timeless individual. Don't let his robes and his tunics disguise him. He is one of us.
[time=1894] In this passage of the Bible, I would like to take a historical profile,
[time=1901] a composite of what three different witnesses said about him, diagnose his heirs and come with
[time=1908] three timeless conclusions. First, let's do what the FBI does, put together a composite profile
[time=1915] of who this man was. We do not know his name. Some have speculated that he was none other than
[time=1922] Joseph of Arimathea, that individual who mysteriously occurs at the end of Christ's life
[time=1929] with a tomb to loan the dead Savior. But that's only speculation. Here's what we do know.
[time=1937] Three things that witnesses have put together. The first we find right here in Mark's account
[time=1943] that he was rich. That's the point of the whole story. He came to Christ. He had an inquiry. And
[time=1950] when the discussion ended, the dividing line was his enormous wealth. A second characteristic is
[time=1959] found in Matthew's account of this same event. Matthew adds one detail that Mark excludes.
[time=1966] Matthew adds the fact that this individual was young. He calls him a young man, probably
[time=1974] someone in his 30s, certainly under 40. And the third composite element that we can add comes from
[time=1983] Dr. Luke, the third gospel writer in the New Testament, who in chapter 18 tells the same story
[time=1990] and adds one final detail that this individual was a ruler, a leader. Probably he held some civic
[time=1998] post, some administrative responsibility in the synagogue, or was recognized in the community as
[time=2004] a young man with an elder status that he sat in the gates and made judgment for those who came
[time=2011] seeking such. That's all we really know of him. He was rich, he was young, and he was a ruler.
[time=2020] Every society has its classes, its SES, socioeconomic strata. The Romans had at the top of the heap
[time=2031] the patricians, followed by the pavilions and lastly the slaves. The castes of India are famous for
[time=2040] their brahman's at the top and their untouchables at the bottom. Even a high school has its classes.
[time=2048] There are the soshes, the jocks, the burnouts, and the geeks and all of high school humanity can be
[time=2056] divided into one of those casts. Larger society is exactly the same way. All types of new sociologic
[time=2064] terms are being used to describe most of us here, particularly if you're a part of that infamous
[time=2070] baby boom. Some of us are yuppies. We are young, we are urban, and we are professional. We live by
[time=2078] the motto, "He who dies with the most toys wins." Others of us are even more affluent. We're called
[time=2086] dinks, double income, no kids, money to spend. There's a new group called the bright-collar workers.
[time=2095] A bright-collar worker is not a blue-collar worker, not necessarily a white-collar worker, but it's that young person with a bright future who has suddenly entered the job market at a very
[time=2106] substantial pay scale. And then there is what most of us are, what I am. We're tweeners. A tweener
[time=2117] is somebody who is in between. They're in between the old values and the new values of the yuppies.
[time=2125] And we're trying to find which of each culture, which of each world can we hold on to,
[time=2131] and we're stuck in between. We're tweeners. Well, as we read about the rich young ruler,
[time=2137] he was probably a young urban professional. And so I'd like to call this message a young urban
[time=2145] professional who couldn't part with his toys. This individual made for fatal flaws.
[time=2154] Bible students from centuries ago have brought these to our attention. I only remind us today.
[time=2161] His first flaw was this, flaw number one. He aired in his identification of Jesus.
[time=2171] He came to Jesus, and according to this text in Mark, he approached him with great respect and
[time=2177] great reverence. He even knelt. That was the way you would treat somebody who you viewed as your
[time=2183] superior. Maybe he was a superior teacher, maybe he was a superior in government, maybe he was an ecclesiastic or hierarch, but he was somebody to be revered, and so he knelt. And as he kneels
[time=2195] before Christ, he opens his mouth and he identifies his concept of who Jesus was with a wonderful name,
[time=2203] good teacher. But there is a problem with that. And Jesus immediately points out the problem.
[time=2213] Jesus said, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God."
[time=2220] Jesus immediately takes the young man on a philosophical quest over the timeless issue
[time=2229] of what is the good. Aristotle wrestled over what is the good. He didn't come away with a
[time=2237] relative ethic or a situational ethic, but he came to the conclusion that the good, the arate,
[time=2243] that which is sharp, is the balance, the golden mean between two extremes. Good is not always courage
[time=2252] because it is not wise for you if you don't know how to swim, to dive into the ocean, to try to rescue someone else. That is full heartiness. So good is the golden mean.
[time=2267] And we asked the question in these days, really, what is good? Studs Turkle wrote of World War II
[time=2276] and he titled his book, "The Good War." And as we compare World War II to World War to the Vietnam
[time=2282] War, it was the good war. We had a sense of purpose. We had decisiveness. We were determined who to win. We knew who our enemy was. He was the guy in the uniform. Vietnam was none of those things.
[time=2294] So World War II was the good war, but can there really be such a thing as a good war? What is really
[time=2301] good? Oliver North comes on the scene and he's a hero because he comes up with a good plan
[time=2308] and some call him hero, but others say no, he is a villain because he had deceived and he lied to
[time=2314] Congress. And we wrestle with what is good? Who is good? And this man comes to Jesus and he says,
[time=2324] good teacher, there is not an occurrence in the whole Old Testament or in any rabbinical
[time=2333] literature of any teacher ever being called good. That was reserved for God. Let me give you some
[time=2339] Old Testament highlights. Psalm 25 verse 8, good and upright is the Lord. Psalm 34, 8,
[time=2348] O taste and see that the Lord is good. Psalm 86, 5, you are forgiving and good, O Lord,
[time=2361] abounding in love. Psalm 106 verse 1, praise the Lord, praise the Lord for he is good, his loving
[time=2372] kindness endures forever. Jesus pins this young man to the wall and he says, why do you call me
[time=2382] good? There is none good but God. Jesus was forcing him to change his identification.
[time=2389] He could not call Jesus good without calling him God because if Jesus was good, he was God and if he wasn't willing to admit that Jesus was God, he couldn't call him good.
[time=2401] It was a dilemma that Jesus drove to his attention to force him to a decision.
[time=2407] His first fatal flaw was he misidentified who Jesus was. His second fatal flaw is in his first
[time=2416] statement. He said, good teacher, what can I do to inherit eternal life? Matthew adds this insight
[time=2425] that he said, what good thing can I do to inherit eternal life? This individual believed that
[time=2436] personal performance was the entrance requirement for heaven. It makes sense then and now personal
[time=2443] performance is almost always the entrance requirement in life's values. If you want to play in the
[time=2450] U.S. Open, you just can't show up on opening day with your tennis racket. You've got to qualify
[time=2456] ahead of time based upon your personal performance. If you would like to go to Notre Dame and play
[time=2464] for Lou Holtz, you can't just show up and say, I'd like to play football for a national championship
[time=2471] team. You've got to qualify as an athlete based upon personal performance.
[time=2477] In Ohio State, they have an examination they administer to determine whether you should
[time=2483] have a college scholarship or not. They hand you a candy bar. If you open it and eat it,
[time=2489] they give you an academic scholarship. If you eat it without opening it, they give you an athletic scholarship. Somehow, life always comes back to personal performance.
[time=2501] Isn't that the way it always is? If you want to go to medical school, you've got to perform
[time=2507] an undergraduate school. This man is just working on a logical assumption that if I want to go
[time=2514] to that world, I've got to perform in this world. Tell me, what is it? What good thing can I do
[time=2523] so that I'll perform and qualify for heaven? The flaw in his thinking is Jesus has tried
[time=2531] repeatedly to correct that universal misconception. He dealt with religious people who viewed
[time=2538] themselves as pious and qualified to enter heaven, and he constantly tried to show them
[time=2544] that they failed the entrance test. You see, there were religious people who were noble,
[time=2550] who were moral, who were upright, but Jesus said to them, "If you want to enter heaven, be perfect, just as your father in heaven is perfect." Now,
[time=2565] that weeded out most of the people. They caught the message that they weren't perfect, but a select few arrogantly said, "I qualify." And so Jesus taught them what really perfection was.
[time=2579] It was not just based upon behavioral performance, but it was based upon word performance
[time=2585] and based upon thought performance. Jesus said to those men who could say, "I've never committed
[time=2592] adultery." Yes, you have, if you've ever looked with lust upon a woman. He could say to those people
[time=2601] who washed their hands and said, "I'm innocent. I've kept the Ten Commandments. I've never murdered
[time=2607] anyone." He put guilt all over their palms when he said, "I tell you whosoever hates his brother
[time=2615] is guilty of murder." But this young man has not yet learned the entrance requirements to heaven
[time=2624] are not personal performance, but it's new birth and forgiveness in Christ.
[time=2631] So Jesus takes him to the wall again. The young man says, "I'm going to make it on personal
[time=2637] performance." So Jesus starts in saying, "You have the law," and he starts going through the Ten Commandments one at a time. Hoping the young guy will catch his drift, swallow hard and say, "I need a little help here," but he doesn't. He is thick-headed. And halfway through Christ's
[time=2653] resuscitation of the law, the young man interrupts, and he says, "I've kept all these things since I
[time=2660] was a little boy." Don't you wish his mother was here to give testimony? I wonder if she would say
[time=2666] he was a perfect little boy. Never once broke a commandment. His second fatal flaw was he
[time=2676] misunderstood the entrance requirements to heaven, and that led to his third fatal flaw,
[time=2685] this one. He aired in the assessment of his own character. He really thought he was morally upright
[time=2695] and that he could stand before God, spotless and clean, based upon his own performance. He said,
[time=2703] "I've kept all these things from my youth." I've shared this story with you, but allow me to repeat
[time=2710] it. It fits, and I like it, so I'm going to bring it in here. These two little boys found a puppy dog,
[time=2716] and they both spotted the puppy dog at the same time, and they were literally having to tug a war over the poor little animal as to who was going to get to keep it. And finally, they came up with a way to decide who would get to take the puppy home. Their plan was,
[time=2732] whoever could tell the biggest and the best lie, got to keep the dog. Just as they finished swapping
[time=2739] yarns, a minister walks up. We'll call him the pastor of the local Baptist Church, and he says,
[time=2747] "Hi boys, what's the problem?" One little guy says, "Well, we found this dog, and we both want him." The little boy chime up and says, "Yeah, but we've got it figured out, mister.
[time=2756] We've just decided whoever can tell the biggest and best lie gets to keep the dog." The minister said, "Oh, that's not a good idea. When I was a little boy, I never did anything like that."
[time=2767] Okay, mister, you get the dog. You know, we look back, and we're not always honest about our past,
[time=2777] and some of us get to take the dog home. We all have sinned. We've all come short of God's standard
[time=2786] of absolute moral perfection. If you are like me in your life, you pull down a few scores well
[time=2794] under the passing mark of 65%. I particularly did that in Latin, too. If you are like me,
[time=2802] there is only one consolation. The desperate hope that no one pulled a grade down better than a 75.
[time=2810] It's not that misery loves company. It's just you're hoping the teacher will grade on the curve.
[time=2816] You're hoping the teacher will look and say, "Well, nobody scored 75, so we'll call 70 to 75,
[time=2823] an A, and 65 to 70 a B, and you just may bring home a C and stay eligible."
[time=2829] And that's what we do spiritually. We say, "Okay, I failed this moral perfection test,
[time=2838] but God grades on a curve, doesn't he?" I mean, and as you put the slope out there, I'm not that far down on the curve. I know Mother Teresa and Albert Switzer and those guys are up here, but Mussolini and Hitler and my mother-in-law are down here, and I've fit in the middle somewhere. God's got a grade on the curve, and he'll draw the line and slice it so I make it.
[time=2858] I'm sure of it. God doesn't grade on the curve. We make a mistake when we assess our self-worth
[time=2869] based upon each other. Paul put it this way in 2 Corinthians, "When we judge ourselves by ourselves
[time=2877] and we commend ourselves by comparing ourselves, we are not wise." If that's too philosophical,
[time=2884] let's go back to the test. Just because you find somebody dumber than you are doesn't mean that you're smart. And just because we find somebody who is less noble or more sinful than we are,
[time=2897] doesn't mean God says, "Okay, you're moral." His third fatal flaw was this one. He
[time=2905] misjudged his own character. His fourth fatal flaw was his most tragic. He aired in his
[time=2914] ultimate choice. He could not part with his toys. This individual came down to a crossroads in life.
[time=2925] He was searching. He was a seeker. He has taken the initiative. He's come to Christ, and Christ
[time=2931] comes to him and poses life's issue. And Jesus says to the young man, "Take everything you have,
[time=2940] sell it, give to the poor, and come and follow me." And the story ends with this sad commentary.
[time=2950] At this, the man's face fell. Why? Because he had great wealth. He couldn't part with his toys.
[time=2962] Before we go any further, can I clear up two misconceptions? Misconception number one is this.
[time=2968] God is anti-money, or God is anti-rich people. Nothing is further from the truth. Some of the
[time=2976] people that God loved the most. He blessed the most. Job was an extremely wealthy man,
[time=2983] as was Abraham, and David, and Solomon. In fact, Solomon's wealth was so enormous
[time=2990] that the telling of it all could not be written down, and Alan Quartermain is still in search of
[time=2996] King Solomon's minds. The Bible doesn't say that money is the root of all evil. It doesn't say that
[time=3004] the lack of money is the root of all evil either. It says the love of money is the root of all evil.
[time=3011] And that was this man's dilemma. He loved his money in his toys, and they were the God of his life.
[time=3018] Second misconception is this. People assume that means if I want to become a Christian,
[time=3025] if I want to be a follower of Jesus, then I've got to take everything I have. I've got to sell it.
[time=3030] I've got to divest myself, give it to the poor, and then I can follow Christ.
[time=3035] That is not true either. Of all of the encounters with Christ to this man, and to this man alone,
[time=3042] did Jesus give such an instruction? Nicodemus came to him, and Jesus didn't mention one thing about selling any of his goods. The woman caught in adultery found forgiveness and healing in Christ,
[time=3053] and he didn't command her to sell a thing. Other wealthy people, a Roman centurion,
[time=3060] came to Christ, and Jesus never once told them to divest themselves. Why then this man?
[time=3068] Because Jesus could see through people. Have you noticed that in these series of encounters with
[time=3076] Jesus, when Jesus healed the layman, he could see through the Pharisees. He knew what they were thinking. When Jesus saw the woman the well, he could see through her, and he could see through her judges, and Jesus could see right through this guy, and he saw into the spirit of the man
[time=3091] into his throne room, and he saw that on the throne of his life was his money. It was his God.
[time=3101] And God will always tell us to dethrone our God and do enthrone him. You see, your money can be
[time=3111] your God. Your career can be your God. You may serve your family to the point where you've ignored
[time=3118] God. You may be a workaholic. You may be driven to get to the top. You may be at the top and driven
[time=3125] to control more mountains. Your God may be your car or your boat. Your God may be your athletic
[time=3133] career. Your desire to qualify for the state championships. Whatever your God is, it has to be
[time=3140] dethroned, and Christ has to be enthroned. Can we close this out with three timeless conclusions
[time=3149] to live by? Quickly. One. Life does not consist in the abundance of what one possesses. You've
[time=3159] seen the bumper sticker. The one with the most toys when he dies wins. That's not true. Let me
[time=3167] suggest these two lines of reasoning. First of all, have you ever seen a hearse pulling a U-Haul
[time=3173] trailer? You don't take it with you. J.D. Rockefeller's accountant was asked after his death,
[time=3183] "How much money did Mr. Rockefeller leave without getting out a calculator or pencil?" The accountant
[time=3189] said, "I can tell you exactly." He left it all. A second line of reasoning is this. As you look at
[time=3198] our society, we are the wealthiest people who have ever walked the globe, and simultaneously we are
[time=3206] the most unhappy people to ever inhabit the earth. There is not a corresponding rise in affluence
[time=3215] with a rise of fulfillment, but there is a sharp contrast between climbing the proverbial
[time=3224] ladder and descending to the depths of despair. Life does not consist in the abundance of what
[time=3233] one possesses. Timeless insight number three. Number two, I was never good in math. We must
[time=3243] cultivate the art of owning without being owned. Someone put it this way. We need to learn to live
[time=3250] within our income and not to live within our credit line. You know, the frustrating thing
[time=3256] about keeping up with the Joneses, I just learned they refinanced. I'm not a comic strip reader,
[time=3266] but I came across this illustration. Herman is sitting down talking to his counselor and the counselor says, "I don't understand your problem. You have a lovely home, an import car, a luxury
[time=3277] condo, south of the tropics. What's your problem?" Herman says, "I only make $85 a week."
[time=3284] The issue with this young man was not what he owned. It was that what he owned owned him.
[time=3299] According to CBS, one year ago, the average American receives 5,000 messages a day that say,
[time=3309] "If you use this toothpaste, you'll have sex appeal. If you buy this car, it's not your father's osmobile. You'll be a status symbol. If you live in this neighborhood, you have arrived in life.
[time=3320] If you use this deodorant, you'll get the contract 5,000 times a week. They say, "Buy it. You've got
[time=3327] to have it. You need it. You're not fulfilled. You're lonely. You're bored. Purchase this." And we do. And we say, "I've got all this stuff and no place to put it." So we buy a bigger house.
[time=3338] And then we have all this empty room. So we buy more stuff.
[time=3342] And we have no place to put it. So we buy a bigger house. We have all this room. So we buy
[time=3348] stuff to fill our houses and we buy houses to fill our stuff. It's the story that Jesus told
[time=3354] in Luke when he said, "The man in agribusiness built his barns and he had a bumper crop. He said,
[time=3360] "I'll just tear him down. I'll build more." But the problem with this man was what he owned,
[time=3366] owned him. Third and final spiritual principle to live by is this one. The universal spiritual
[time=3375] principle is the follow Christ. To Nicodemus, he told me he had to change his religious outlook.
[time=3383] To the woman caught in the adultery, he said, "Go and sin no more." To the rich young ruler, he said, "Take and sell all that you have and give it to the poor." None of those are the same,
[time=3395] but the one thing that's the same is this. To each of them, Jesus said, "You come and follow me."
[time=3405] And if you want to die and to win, you have to come to Christ. You have to follow him.
[time=3415] You may not have to sell one thing. You may not have to change your church denomination,
[time=3423] but the one thing that you must do is you must come to Christ and follow him.
[time=3436] We've been sharing with you today the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir,
[time=3448] the men singers and a duet by Marilyn Wong and Marcia Richard. The message was from our pastor
[time=3454] Rick Hawks. If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your
[time=3460] Savior, I'd like to take a moment to pray this prayer with you. Will you bow and pray it with me?
[time=3465] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for
[time=3472] my sins. And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to forgive me of the
[time=3479] sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. If you prayed that
[time=3488] prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual
[time=3498] walk with God. To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or "The Devotional Guide"
