[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=90] The truth is always our best option.
[time=93] It has its consequences and they can never be escaped.
[time=98] (bells chiming) (bells chiming) (bells chiming) (bells chiming) (bells chiming) (bells chiming) Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Charles and Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=122] Thank you for joining us.
[time=124] Rick's message today is entitled "Recognizing the Truth." Truth or Consequences.
[time=130] Every day each of us face this dilemma.
[time=133] The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
[time=136] What is right morally seems wrong professionally.
[time=140] The instinct to cover up or exaggerate comes naturally.
[time=144] Fear mixes with emotion.
[time=146] It seems more important than escaping the consequences of the truth.
[time=150] Punch's pilot was a man facing such a dilemma.
[time=154] Rick has three implications for our lives today that we can learn from Pilot's Dilemma.
[time=160] Our special music today includes a song from Denise Mitchell and Kevin Roll.
[time=166] And Reflection.
[time=171] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a number entitled "Joy in the Morning." (upbeat music)
[time=184] [MUSIC - 187 seconds]
[time=376] - Amen.
[time=391] And since there's going to be so much joy up in heaven, why don't we just begin with those designations of the peace and the contaminant that's there and just have it right here in our own fellowship.
[time=402] And since we're all going to be together anyway, that'll just be a head start on that great fellowship we're going to have together.
[time=408] Jesus may come today, we don't know, that will be indeed a glad day.
[time=413] Let's continue with our music as we sing 236.
[time=416] Him number 236, sing the first and fourth stanzas together.
[time=421] (gentle music)
[time=429] [MUSIC]
[time=459] (singing in foreign language)
[time=519] (singing in foreign language) - Thank you very much for your singing,
[time=534] we appreciate that.
[time=536] We continue with music now as we draw our attention to a duet by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Roll.
[time=542] Let's listen as they minister to us.
[time=544] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 195 seconds]
[time=751] (gentle music) - We have broken away from our morning worship service
[time=770] to share some coming events with you friends who join us by way of television.
[time=775] We're excited about coming events in the life of our church and don't want you to miss out on any of those.
[time=780] Joining Pete and myself is my wife Kathy.
[time=783] Thanks for getting up early this morning and coming in to record with us.
[time=786] - Well, thank you for the invitation.
[time=788] - Pete, we have a special concert coming up in just a few weeks.
[time=791] - Rick, for the last week I've been listening to Bruce Greer on a tape recording of his piano playing and I'd like to invite all of you that are watching today to come and join with us on Sunday, October 15th.
[time=802] He's gonna join our choir and orchestra and play for us on Sunday morning and then give an entire concert that evening at 6 p.m.
[time=809] It'll be a great day.
[time=811] He really is a fine pianist and really loves to serve the Lord in that way.
[time=815] - Well, when I hear you mention Bruce Greer, I think of the song he wrote for our church's dedication.
[time=821] - I was entitled "The Lord Rains" and we will be doing that song that Sunday morning.
[time=825] It's a very powerful piece.
[time=826] - I'm looking forward to that and I understand that he and Scott are gonna team up and do a dueling pianos number.
[time=833] - Are fortunate to have two pianos that are identical and Bruce arranged that song specifically for orchestra and two pianos and our own Scott Schindler will be joining Bruce on one of the pianos and it'll be a great concert.
[time=846] - Oh, that really will.
[time=847] That's coming up on October the 15th in our two morning services and then at six o'clock, Sunday night, October the 15th, a full musical concert.
[time=856] We hope you can be a part of that.
[time=858] As Pete and I are around town, the most commonly asked question is, "Where can we get living Christmas tree tickets?" We haven't even printed the tickets yet.
[time=867] We'll make it available to the public.
[time=869] In early November, we'll put it on the newspaper.
[time=872] We'll tell you by way of television.
[time=874] We have sent a letter out to our founders club members, giving them a little advance notice, but you don't need to call or write yet.
[time=881] We don't even have the tickets, but we'll let you know.
[time=885] My wife is here because she is in charge of a great event coming up.
[time=888] Our women's retreat.
[time=890] When's that coming up?
[time=891] - October 21st, October 20th and 21st, it's a Friday night and a Saturday.
[time=896] - And this friend of ours is coming to be the speaker.
[time=899] We are so excited that Marcia Coats, the wife of Senator Dan Coats, has agreed to come and be our speaker.
[time=904] She not only will be giving her testimony, but Rick, she's going to have an open format where the audience can participate in an interview with her and ask questions about her personal life, her spiritual life, anything about her children and some issues that she's able to answer.
[time=918] - Well, we'll look forward to that.
[time=919] Marcia and Dan Coats are not only leaders in our nation, but spiritual leaders as well.
[time=925] But you have some other people coming as well.
[time=927] - We're real excited with the issue of drugs.
[time=930] The president just addressing that in this last month.
[time=933] We have a member of our emergency SWAT team, Mike Cunningham, who is one of the men who works with the crack raids here in Fort Wayne and also Sergeant Larry White.
[time=942] And they will both be joining us also for open interviews with audience participation.
[time=946] And we'll be talking about our drug and alcohol problem and all the other crime and abuse problems that our city has.
[time=952] And we'll be learning from them how they cope with it as being men of God.
[time=957] And not only that, but how we as people in our own community can help our own homes and our own community in that area.
[time=964] - Well, that'll be a great weekend.
[time=965] I feel a little cheated.
[time=966] I don't think I can sneak in for a women's retreat.
[time=968] - No, we charge men double, but it's only $12.50 for a woman to come.
[time=973] The overnight reservations are filled.
[time=975] So no one can come at this point and spend the night.
[time=977] We'll be at the hollow dome here in Fort Wayne, just off-call C.M. Boulevard.
[time=981] But the all day Saturday and Friday night, they're welcome to come Friday night and rejoin us again Saturday morning at eight o'clock.
[time=988] And it's only $12.50.
[time=989] That includes your lunch for the day.
[time=991] - Sounds great.
[time=992] How can they register?
[time=993] - If they would just call me here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=996] As soon as we go back to the program, the church service this morning on TV, I will be on the phone lines.
[time=1001] And you can just call area code 219-493-7400.
[time=1006] And I will answer the calls and any questions that you would have and be happy to take their names down and register them for that retreat.
[time=1012] - Great, we normally tell you to call Monday through Friday, but she's gonna be here so you can call right now.
[time=1018] So please dial us at 493-7400 and you can register for the ladies' retreat.
[time=1024] Before we go back to our morning worship service, I have a booklet to share with you.
[time=1028] It's titled "How in the World Is It Going to End?" This is a booklet that I've put together with some of the staff here at Blackhawk that talks about biblical prophecy and these end times.
[time=1040] The Bible tells us that we can't know the day or the hour when Jesus will come.
[time=1045] And I'm certainly not gonna predict when that is.
[time=1048] But I believe it's our responsibility to watch and to pray and to be ready and serving Christ because he could come at any moment.
[time=1057] This booklet goes through some of the events like the rapture, the tribulation.
[time=1062] It tells us who some of the heroes and villains of the end time will be.
[time=1066] So we wanna send you a copy of this 30 page booklet as a gift from us to you.
[time=1071] Just simply ask for the book titled, How in the World Is It Going to End?
[time=1075] - You can receive this helpful booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1086] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1096] - Thank you, Pete and Kathy and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1101] (upbeat music)
[time=1109] [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=1184] You are Lord of Heaven and Earth.
[time=1191] You are Lord of all.
[time=1218] And have our being.
[time=1262] (singing in foreign language)
[time=1292] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=1344] (singing in foreign language)
[time=1375] Our God, we give to you today the praise of our lips and the adoration of our hearts.
[time=1381] We wanna sing with this group because we are overcome with joy today as we think of your goodness to us.
[time=1387] You have so richly blessed us and we are grateful.
[time=1391] We come today, God, to give you our worship, the sacrifice of our praise.
[time=1396] We've come on this first day of the week to say that you are first in our lives.
[time=1401] We love you and we wanna celebrate Jesus Christ.
[time=1405] Help us today to live so godly in Christ Jesus that the watching world will know that he is alive when they witness us.
[time=1415] Oh, God, we love you.
[time=1417] Lord Jesus, we've come to thank you for your undescribable gift of new life and eternal life.
[time=1424] And our hearts are overflowing.
[time=1426] We rejoice today in you, our God, our Savior.
[time=1430] We wanna thank you for the way that you have interceded on our behalf.
[time=1434] You have answered prayer.
[time=1436] Thank you for the men whose hands I shook this morning who are believers in Christ who weren't a year ago.
[time=1443] You answered the prayers of their wives.
[time=1446] We are grateful.
[time=1447] Thank you for the hands that we have shaken together this morning of those whose families were fractured and you have restored.
[time=1456] We are grateful.
[time=1457] Thank you today that Greg Hindle can worship with us and his leukemia is in remission.
[time=1463] Thank you today that you've given victory over depression to those who have battled with it long and hard.
[time=1471] Thank you today that you are our God.
[time=1474] Help us Lord.
[time=1476] As we go through even different battles, we would pray this morning for the Moors that you would encourage Wayne and Debbie with a recovery, even miraculous in little Amy's body.
[time=1491] We pray that you would bring her back to full health and the life.
[time=1497] Thank you that we have living testimonies that you interceded.
[time=1502] Thank you that Jeremy is a part of our church healthy and alive that Nathan overcame insurmountable odds that Hanalees is still a part of this fellowship with a full-minded body that helps us to trust you and we're grateful.
[time=1519] We would ask your comfort on Barb Strong and Larry White as they have gone through the valley of the shadow of death losing a parent this week.
[time=1528] We would ask you to strengthen Harry Bennett in the hospital room to help him to know that he is not alone and that you're with him.
[time=1536] And even this morning, as we worship you, we want to declare that we love you in Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1558] We're dear brothers and sisters, I hope that I can help
[time=1566] by sharing what God's showing me, I hope you see or say.
[time=1574] Maybe you feel that one too many times you've walked away
[time=1582] but his love is everlasting and the price completely paid.
[time=1591] God is greater than I feel yours, greater than I've seen
[time=1600] and greater is his love for us and all I love for him.
[time=1607] His pride is brighter and the brighter strain of hope we can look so through.
[time=1615] Praise our God and God is greater than he meant be the first be thee.
[time=1629] It's hard just to imagine this love is from the Lord,
[time=1637] the one who gave so freely what we could not afford.
[time=1645] And I don't think we can understand the death of what was done,
[time=1653] but freedom and forgiveness that he gives us in his Son.
[time=1662] God is greater than I feel yours, greater than I've seen
[time=1671] and greater is his love for us and all I love for him.
[time=1678] His pride is brighter than the brightest strain of hope we can look so through.
[time=1686] Praise our God and God is greater than he meant be the first be thee.
[time=1697] Dear child, he knows you love him, he sees beyond your tears.
[time=1705] With his despite the weakness, your is despite the fears.
[time=1713] And we can only praise him for his love for you and me.
[time=1721] He has healed the broken heart and we have set the captive free.
[time=1728] God is greater than I feel yours, greater than I've seen and greater is his love for us and all I love for him.
[time=1744] His pride is brighter than the brightest strain of hope we can look so through.
[time=1752] Praise our God and God is greater than he meant be the first be thee.
[time=1782] Thank you, reflection.
[time=1787] Our confidence is in our God no matter how insurmountable the odds seem to be.
[time=1793] Our God is still greater.
[time=1796] If you have a Bible today, I want to invite you to open it to John chapter 18 in a moment that will frame our study for the day.
[time=1805] I need to confess to you that my wife, Kathy, is one of the world's worst drivers.
[time=1811] The only person who I can think of who is more notorious would be her husband.
[time=1819] We both can turn a normal American made car into a lethal weapon.
[time=1824] One day, without malice or forethought, Kathy ran down a light pole in the North State parking lot.
[time=1832] That doesn't sound like much, but you need to understand the story.
[time=1836] The light pole is planted on a three foot 400 pound cylinder of concrete and then rises 12 feet above it.
[time=1845] Kathy ran it down, knocking the light pole back over the car, knocking the 400 pound cylinder sideways,
[time=1853] driving the car up on top of the cylinder so the front two wheels are in the air turning.
[time=1859] With her foot on the gas, she propels it on an arc across the parking lot, bringing it to rest right between the lines, between two other parked cars.
[time=1871] When she got out of the car, it was the first time she noticed that the front end was suspended in the air.
[time=1878] Her opening comment was, "I thought I hit a pop cam."
[time=1884] Then she congratulated herself that she at least steered it successfully to a safe resting point, which she had not.
[time=1893] But I'm worse.
[time=1896] When I put a car in reverse, you're in trouble.
[time=1900] Some friends of ours, maybe their former friends now, by the name of McKenny's, moved from Black Hawk to Chicago.
[time=1907] Their daughter, Cheryl, came to visit and stayed with us.
[time=1911] I'm type-aid personality. I do three or four things at once.
[time=1915] So I jump in the car, turn on the engine, drop it in reverse, and hit the garage door button in one motion.
[time=1921] Then I look back, at which time I saw one of the McKenny's cars parked right there and slammed on the brakes a split second too late.
[time=1930] Minimal damage, but I wasn't going to get by with it.
[time=1934] I called Jack and said, "Jack, I'm really sorry, Cheryl's down here visiting us and I just backed into your car. He didn't believe me."
[time=1941] So I stuck with it and he finally believed I backed into his car in my driveway.
[time=1946] The very next weekend, Jack's son, Mark, came to Black Hawk to visit, stayed with us, parked his car in my driveway.
[time=1953] I got into the car, turned on the engine, dropped it in reverse, hit the garage door button, backed up in one motion, and hit Jack's other car.
[time=1961] I so desperately wanted to hide.
[time=1968] The last phone call on earth I wanted to make was, area code 312.
[time=1975] Jack, this is Rick, you know your other car?
[time=1979] Is that body man pretty good?
[time=1982] Owning up to the truth is tough.
[time=1985] So tough, here is what some people actually put on their insurance claims.
[time=1990] I swerved to the right and then to the left when the telephone pole struck me broadside.
[time=1999] Another person claims the parked car was approaching fast.
[time=2005] I couldn't get out of its path.
[time=2008] The all-time winner had to be, an invisible car came out of nowhere, struck me broadside and mysteriously disappeared.
[time=2019] Telling the truth is tough.
[time=2022] Yet the truth is always our best buy.
[time=2028] Its consequences cannot be escaped, only delayed.
[time=2033] It is always our best buy.
[time=2036] In John chapter 18, we meet Pontius Pilate, a man who couldn't recognize the truth when it was staring him in the face.
[time=2045] Allow me to read for you chapter 18 verses 28 through the end of that chapter.
[time=2053] When the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor.
[time=2059] By now, it was early morning and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness, the Jews did not enter the palace.
[time=2068] They wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
[time=2071] So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?" "If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."
[time=2086] Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law."
[time=2092] But we have no right to execute anyone, the Jews objected.
[time=2096] This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.
[time=2105] Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him,
[time=2111] "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Is that your own idea?" Jesus asked, "Or did others talk to you about me?" "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied.
[time=2127] "It was your people and your high priest who handed you over to me."
[time=2133] "What is it you've done?" Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[time=2141] If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews." "But now my kingdom is from another place." "You are a king then?" said Pilate.
[time=2154] Jesus answered.
[time=2157] "You are right in saying I am a king.
[time=2160] In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world to testify to the truth."
[time=2168] Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.
[time=2173] "That is truth," Pilate asked.
[time=2178] With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.
[time=2186] But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover." "Do you want me to release the king of the Jews?" They shouted back.
[time=2197] "No, not him. Give us Barabbas." Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.
[time=2207] A Pontius Pilate is a man of whom we know little.
[time=2212] Only the pages of the scripture tell us much about him.
[time=2216] History records just a few scant paragraphs of his life.
[time=2221] A group of Sunday school students were asked to sketch the story out of Matthew chapter 2 when Jesus fled from Herod and they took flight to Egypt.
[time=2231] And all these kids are drawing pictures of camels and horses and animals and pyramids in the background.
[time=2238] But one little boy drew an airplane.
[time=2241] A Sunday school teacher said, "Well Johnny, there weren't airplanes back then.
[time=2244] Sure there were. That is how they took the flight to Egypt." The teacher said, "Okay, well who are all these people?" "I see Joseph and Mary and the baby but who's that guy?" The boy said, "Well that's Pontius, the Pilate." Well you may not know much about this man Pontius Pilate, but he asked the question of all time when he was staring the answer right in the face.
[time=2271] Jesus Christ was the way, the truth and the life.
[time=2277] And Pilate looked him eye to eye and said, "What is truth?
[time=2283] What is truth anyway?" I mean how can you know anything for certain?
[time=2288] Who can you trust?
[time=2290] Whose product can you buy and really believe that it's actually new, improved and better?
[time=2297] What is truth?
[time=2299] I mean can you really believe what the newspapers tell you?
[time=2302] Don't they have their own bias?
[time=2306] Listen to Sam Donaldson on tape, give the insights of his book.
[time=2311] Hold on Mr. President.
[time=2313] And Donaldson rightly says that the President puts his own spin on the news.
[time=2319] You can't say that whatever the President says is unequivocally unbiased.
[time=2324] He's putting his own slant on it.
[time=2326] He wants you to see him positively.
[time=2329] And then Donaldson says, "It's the job of the press to tell you the truth." And I wanted to grab the cassette right out of the car and say, "Sam Donaldson, why do I believe you're telling the truth if anybody puts a spin on the truth you do?"
[time=2344] What is truth?
[time=2347] Pilate said, "I listen to the Jews, and I listen to the Romans, and who isn't right? What is truth?"
[time=2357] He raises a timeless question which will bring us to three implications that we cannot escape.
[time=2365] Before we do that, let's chronicle the events of this day very quickly.
[time=2370] At night, Jesus is arrested and tried in a kangaroo court.
[time=2375] Both the arrests and the trial were illegal.
[time=2379] The morning comes, his adversaries take him to Pilate, hoping the pilot will execute him.
[time=2385] The Jews could stone Jesus, but they wanted it in a Roman affair.
[time=2390] They wanted a crucifixion.
[time=2393] They unwittingly were playing into the hand of Jesus who had been predicting for a year that he would die in Jerusalem on a crucified death.
[time=2404] So they took him to Pilate. Pilate arranged him and ceremoniously says,
[time=2410] "There's no charges against this guy. Let him go." But mob ruled that day and they said, "No." Now, Pilate's in a dilemma. He views Jesus as innocent, but the mob saying, "We want him dead."
[time=2428] He comes up with a maneuver. How about a change of venue?
[time=2431] He learns that Jesus is from Galilee. Herod is the tetrarch, the ruler of Galilee.
[time=2436] He just happens to be in Jerusalem, and he ships Jesus over to Herod, and let's Herod dry him.
[time=2442] Herod amuses himself at Christ's expense and ships him right back.
[time=2447] It's a game of hot potato, and Jesus was the issue.
[time=2452] Pilate, again, asks Jesus questions, and again comes the conclusion that he's innocent.
[time=2459] This time he tries to extend clemency.
[time=2463] It was a tradition that during a holiday like Passover that a criminal would be released.
[time=2468] Many of the criminals were folk heroes of the day. They were Robin Hood, Panchavilla.
[time=2474] They were the bad guys who represented the good.
[time=2479] And Pilate says, "It's Passover. All release the King of the Jews."
[time=2485] And the people respond, "No, not him. We want Barabbas," an insurrectionist.
[time=2495] Pilate, again, pleads with them, but they want to see Jesus dead.
[time=2501] This time, Pilate takes Jesus, and he has him mocked and flogged.
[time=2505] Then he parades in front of this hostile crowd the scant resemblance of a man,
[time=2512] ripped and torn by 40 lashes, hoping that would satisfy this bloodthirsty crowd.
[time=2521] And he says, "I'll release him." And again, they shout, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
[time=2530] And Pilate succumbs to the dilemma and concludes it when he says, "He's innocent."
[time=2540] And they said, "He claims to be a king. We have no king but Caesar." If you release him, you're no friend of Caesar's.
[time=2547] And Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified, but first, in front of their eyes,
[time=2555] washes his hand, symbolic that he wants to be innocent of the whole affair.
[time=2562] Pilate had a dilemma. He had a whole lot of information
[time=2568] and very little time to digest it.
[time=2572] Don't you feel sorry for an NFL coach?
[time=2575] He hits fourth and four.
[time=2578] He's got a headset on, and you know there's some guy up in the booth talking to him.
[time=2584] He's got his quarterback, his second string quarterback, and three of his assistant coaches.
[time=2590] Everybody's telling him what to do.
[time=2592] "Pant, pass, run the ball, trade the bomb!" And he knows that there are 80,000 people in the stands.
[time=2600] And they've got a pom-pom in one hand if it wins, and a linch rope in the other hand if they lose.
[time=2607] And at home, there are only two million people who know better than you what to do.
[time=2612] And you have got 60 seconds to make your decision.
[time=2617] Pilate was in one of those dilemmas. He thought, "Ah, it's Friday."
[time=2623] "Thank Jupiter, it's finally Friday." He went through his daytime and there wasn't all that much.
[time=2630] It was going to be a good day in Walk Caiaphas.
[time=2635] The last person in Jerusalem he wanted to see, dragging some Galilean.
[time=2641] It should have been a five to ten minute administrative disposal.
[time=2646] And it turned into an all day saga of him running between the crowd and Jesus,
[time=2653] never a moment to think, never a pause to reason, and the pressures were coming down.
[time=2661] He was a man torn in two ways.
[time=2664] On this side of the ledger, Pilate was a man with a Roman sense of justice.
[time=2671] The Roman motto was, "Let justice prevail, though the heavens fail."
[time=2677] They were proud and rightfully so for their sense of jurisprudence.
[time=2682] In fact, much of our law today is based on that of these latins.
[time=2689] Pilate had investigated and he had come clearly to the conclusion.
[time=2694] And he stated it three times that Jesus was innocent.
[time=2699] And that Roman sense of justice nagged at him to let Jesus go.
[time=2707] Compounding it on this side of the ledger, Matthew tells us,
[time=2713] Pilate got a note from his wife.
[time=2716] The note said, "I have had a dream, better called a nightmare.
[time=2720] And in my dream, I suffered many things thinking about this Jesus and don't have anything to do with him." He had a religious superstition about Jesus.
[time=2734] That combined with his Roman sense of justice forced him to want to let Jesus go.
[time=2742] And he continually tried to do that.
[time=2746] But on the other side of the ledger, Pilate was a man driven by public pressure.
[time=2753] His job then was very similar to the job of ambassadors now.
[time=2759] I mean, how would you like the assignment?
[time=2761] You take the next flight to Beirut and bring peace between Jerusalem and Beirut.
[time=2768] Quite frankly, I think I would look into early retirement.
[time=2774] Pilate was a man sent to the political boiling pot of the world, and he was trying to keep peace.
[time=2783] And he was very unsuccessful.
[time=2786] His first movement into the city was an absolute blunder.
[time=2790] He came in as a proud Roman, marching in front of his legion, holding his banners high as each of his soldiers did.
[time=2797] And at the top of their banner, they had a little statue of the emperor, who they believed was a god.
[time=2803] Every other governor in Jerusalem removed that before entering the city.
[time=2807] Pilate would not.
[time=2810] There was great dissidents and threat of insurrection over that issue.
[time=2815] Pilate summoned all of the unhappy people into the amphitheater, heard them out, and then pointed a sword at them and said, "You will live under my sword, or you'll die under my sword."
[time=2830] And on the walls of the amphitheater rose soldiers surrounding the place with their swords drawn,
[time=2836] and he told them to submit now or die.
[time=2840] And this Jewish mob took off their togas and stretched out their necks and said,
[time=2846] "Take our lives." Even Pilate couldn't slay an amphitheater full of innocent men.
[time=2855] And from his first day in the city of Jerusalem, he was controlled by public pressure.
[time=2862] The statues of the emperor came off, and from that day on, Pilate listened to the mob.
[time=2870] And today the mob was saying, "Crucified Jesus." He was not only a man driven by public pressure, but he was a man dominated by proper procedure.
[time=2883] He was a Roman, he was a representative of the emperor, and he would do his duty.
[time=2891] And as Pilate is trying to let Jesus go, they throw the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[time=2899] John 19, verse 12.
[time=2902] From then on, Pilate tried to free Jesus, but the Jews kept shouting,
[time=2908] "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar,
[time=2914] anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."
[time=2922] He had a job to do.
[time=2924] Procedure said, "Eliminate anyone who was a rival to the emperor."
[time=2930] And he would do his duty.
[time=2932] His dilemma was enormous.
[time=2935] He had a Roman sense of justice and a religious superstition about Jesus, but he was driven by public opinion and dominated by proper procedure,
[time=2946] and there was no way he was going to win on this Friday.
[time=2952] Somebody had greased the truth, and he couldn't get a grip on it.
[time=2960] What was right morally was wrong professionally.
[time=2966] The right thing to do was to let Jesus go, but it was the very wrong thing to do professionally.
[time=2973] It wouldn't be in peace.
[time=2975] It wouldn't prove him to be a loyal representative of Caesar, so kill Jesus.
[time=2982] But that in his own heart he knew was wrong.
[time=2987] Nagging out his own soul is the question he brings to us today.
[time=2992] What is truth?
[time=2997] I'd like to bring this down now to three implications that we must all live by.
[time=3004] The first one is this.
[time=3007] The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
[time=3012] That's a quote from the writer Oscar Wilde.
[time=3016] The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
[time=3021] On the one hand, truth was let the innocent man go.
[time=3024] On the other hand, truth was watch out for yourself.
[time=3028] Your whole career, peace in this land, rest upon just giving in the popular opinion.
[time=3037] The truth is rarely pure and it is never simple.
[time=3045] Some of you face that daily.
[time=3049] Some of you have taken an insurance claim to your supervisor and said, "This doesn't add up.
[time=3056] We shouldn't pay this claim." Your supervisor looked at the name and said, "Yeah, but he's a good customer.
[time=3063] Just sign off.
[time=3064] Don't make any waves.
[time=3066] The company can cover that one." You say, "That's not right.
[time=3071] It's not an honest claim." Your supervisor says, "I said sign off.
[time=3078] Don't make any waves." Some of you have been called in to work to do a little overtime, to mark the prices up this week
[time=3087] so that they can have a sale next week when they mark the prices down.
[time=3092] You say, "That's no discount.
[time=3096] That's no sale.
[time=3097] That's no good deal." Nobody wins.
[time=3103] Some of you have been the victims of representing your company and every word you said was honest
[time=3112] and every conclusion you led the customer to believe was false.
[time=3117] You know, we can say things that are absolutely true and totally misleading.
[time=3123] Let me give you an illustration.
[time=3125] I'm going to tell you something that is absolutely true and totally misleading.
[time=3129] I was at the mall yesterday.
[time=3131] I saw Pete Coby and you'll never believe it.
[time=3134] He was stone sober.
[time=3136] That's absolutely true.
[time=3138] But the implication is it's rare to find Pete Coby sober.
[time=3143] The truth of the matter is he's a tea toddler.
[time=3146] He doesn't even like tea.
[time=3147] He's been sober every day of his life.
[time=3150] But the implication I can give you by saying that is that it's a rarity.
[time=3154] And some of you in your work, you know that's been your job to tell them all the facts,
[time=3161] but in the way that will lead them to the wrong conclusion.
[time=3166] The truth is rarely pure and seldom simple.
[time=3175] The truth becomes even harder to tell when we mix in the components of fear
[time=3183] or of anger.
[time=3187] Well, I was a young boy.
[time=3189] I was afraid of bringing some papers home for my parents to see.
[time=3195] The whole way home is a first grader.
[time=3197] I contemplated how I was going to dispose of the evidence.
[time=3202] The proof that I wasn't bright was already on the paper, but I substantiated it by hiding them in the milk box.
[time=3209] I walked in the house.
[time=3210] My mother said, "Do you have any papers?" No, no papers today, and she bought it just like that.
[time=3215] That's off the hook.
[time=3217] Till the next morning, when she heard the milkman pull away and went out to get our two gallons of milk out of the box and found some strange papers stuffed in there as well and unfolded them.
[time=3229] And I was found out.
[time=3231] That leads us to the next implication.
[time=3234] It is this one.
[time=3236] The truth is always your best choice.
[time=3242] The consequences cannot be escaped.
[time=3246] Maybe delayed, but not ultimately escaped.
[time=3250] I thought I was real slick.
[time=3252] You just take these papers, you stuff them in the milk box, no one will ever find out.
[time=3256] He says, "That's not very bright." You think, "Oh, I'm smarter than that.
[time=3260] I'd be smart enough not to stick them in the milk box." We're a brilliant generation, aren't we?
[time=3267] No one will ever find out.
[time=3268] We'll call it generic drugs.
[time=3269] We'll alter it.
[time=3270] No one will ever find out.
[time=3272] Find out about it.
[time=3274] We'll just take a little money here, send it over there.
[time=3276] I ran, cleaned it through Switzerland, sent it on the Nicaragua.
[time=3279] No one will ever know.
[time=3280] Did anyone ever know?
[time=3282] We'll just bug this hotel room.
[time=3285] We'll just keep it amongst friends.
[time=3287] We'll just tighten the rain so that no one will know what we did at that obscure Washington hotel called Watergate.
[time=3294] No one will ever find out.
[time=3296] Did they find out?
[time=3299] Truth and time go hand in hand.
[time=3305] In life, your best option is always the truth.
[time=3310] You cannot escape its consequences.
[time=3314] They can only be delayed.
[time=3316] The third and final implication out of this,
[time=3322] we will all be judged on how we judge Jesus.
[time=3328] The tables were absolutely turned in flip-flopped on pilot.
[time=3333] He starts off his morning by being the Roman governor and he's the judge.
[time=3339] And an obscure Galilean is brought before him for him to pass judgment.
[time=3345] And before the whole day is over, pilot by afternoon is being judged by the mob.
[time=3351] If you don't crucify him, then you're not a friend of Caesar.
[time=3356] And suddenly it's not who is Jesus and what he's done.
[time=3360] It's who is pilot and what's he going to do with Jesus?
[time=3366] And pilot went from judge to defendant like that.
[time=3373] You don't find it ironic because you and I are in the exact same position.
[time=3379] Today we're judge.
[time=3381] Today we have the option.
[time=3382] We can accept Jesus Christ as our Savior and follow him as Lord.
[time=3387] Or we can judge him unworthy of such devotion.
[time=3390] We can label him a good Galilean, a profound philosopher, an ethical example, but say no.
[time=3399] I judge him not to be God and I judge him not to be worthy of my devotion.
[time=3404] Today you and I are the judge.
[time=3409] The options are ours.
[time=3412] We get to choose which cards we'll hold, which cards we'll play.
[time=3418] But the table will be turned.
[time=3420] Just as surely as it was on pilot, they'll come a day when we'll stand before that Jesus.
[time=3426] And God will judge us on how we handled him.
[time=3431] If we accept him as our Savior and follow him as our Lord, I'll say welcome home my child.
[time=3439] Well done now good and faithful servant.
[time=3442] But if we do not accept him as our Savior and follow him as our Lord,
[time=3449] then he'll look at us and say I never knew you.
[time=3453] And we might say God I was very, very religious.
[time=3457] He'll say I never knew you.
[time=3460] Lord I went to Blackhawk.
[time=3462] I was in the second service every Sunday.
[time=3465] I never knew you.
[time=3467] Lord I was significant.
[time=3471] I helped start all kinds of charities.
[time=3474] And the Lord will say I never knew you.
[time=3480] The ultimate implication is pilot was a man who couldn't recognize the truth when it was staring him in the face.
[time=3488] And he became not the judge, but the judged.
[time=3491] And we'll go the same route.
[time=3494] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir,
[time=3508] a duet by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe and the group Reflection.
[time=3513] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3516] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3524] Let's bow together.
[time=3526] Dear Heavenly Father, I do thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3534] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3537] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3542] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3546] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3551] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
