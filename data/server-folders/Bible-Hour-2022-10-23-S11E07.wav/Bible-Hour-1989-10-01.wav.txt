[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=83] Her life was wretched, it was miserable.
[time=88] And in a moment, like that, it was changed.
[time=93] (music playing)
[time=99] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=111] Thank you for joining us.
[time=112] Rick's message today is entitled A Soiled Reputation that came out smelling like a rose.
[time=119] In the same encounter, Jesus brought together two unlikely lives.
[time=123] She was wretched, He was self-righteous.
[time=127] Both needed forgiveness, both needed Christ.
[time=131] The difference between them was not so much the amount of sin, but the awareness of sin.
[time=137] Today we will be studying how Jesus Christ can change lives dramatically and completely.
[time=143] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Luke.
[time=147] We will be looking at chapter 7 verses 36 through 50.
[time=152] Our special music today includes a solo from Kevin Rowe and Lisa Reniker.
[time=161] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a number entitled Jesus the very thought of thee.
[time=169] (music playing)
[time=188] Jesus the very thought of thee, where sweetness fills my breast.
[time=206] Thus we turn on our face to see.
[time=214] And in thy presence, rest.
[time=226] (music playing)
[time=347] How beautiful it is, just to quietly rest on the fact that Jesus loves us and will indeed as we let him make our lives beautiful in his time.
[time=356] My Jesus, I love thee.
[time=358] Him number 364, we'll sing the first, second and fourths, stanzas together. Him number 364.
[time=367] (music playing)
[time=518] Thank you very much for your good singing. Let's continue in music. Now Kevin Rowe comes to minister to us. Let's participate as we listen to the message that he has for us.
[time=529] (music playing)
[time=537] There's not one who has perfectly obeyed God's law. There's not one who has tried to follow God at all. There's not one who's half obeyed, his symbol has come.
[time=566] There's not one who understands. No one was willing to believe. No one was worthy to receive. But God showed his love for us while we went our selfish ways.
[time=595] He gave up his son for us and he paid the debt. No man could pay and now there is one.
[time=611] There's not one who has done the very best they could. There's not one who has had a single thought that's good. There's not one who's lived on earth.
[time=639] That God could not condemn. There's not one he would have even. No one was willing to believe. No one was worthy to receive.
[time=661] But God showed his love for us while we went our selfish ways. He gave up his son for us and he paid the debt. No man could pay and now there is one.
[time=686] Now there is one.
[time=711] There is one who fulfilled the Father's just demands.
[time=722] There is one who became the hope for every man.
[time=733] There is one who rose up of every sin this world has known. There is one who stands alone.
[time=752] God showed his love for us while we went our selfish ways. He gave up his son for us and he paid the debt. No man could pay and now there is one.
[time=808] Why hope and trust that the first part of our worship service has already tuned your hearts to sing God's praises.
[time=820] Pete, we're looking forward to a concert coming up that I know will do that as well.
[time=824] We've talked a lot about Bruce Greer in recent weeks and he'll be here on October 15th.
[time=829] Bruce is a staff writer for Word Inc. out of Dallas, Texas. He writes a lot of music for Sandy Patty and various singers that go around the country but he is also a very fine pianist and he'll be joining with our orchestra and choir and Scott on that day for a great concert.
[time=847] Well, I enjoy the orchestra and they've played today and I'll look forward to that. They're going to team up and do a dueling piano number. I believe we're going to bring our other piano on the stage and Scott will be playing one and Bruce will be playing the other and the orchestra will be accompanying them.
[time=862] That'll be a beautiful song. Well, I'm looking forward to Bruce Greer's coming. If you came to our dedication Sunday when we opened this new worship center, you may remember a powerful, powerful song that our choir sang.
[time=875] It was entitled "The Lord Rains" and Bruce Greer is the one who wrote it and he wrote it specifically for the dedication of our building. Well, we get to hear an instant replay of that, I hope.
[time=885] We'll sing that Sunday morning, yes. Oh, that's great. Well, Bruce will be here with us Sunday morning, October 15th as a part of our morning worship service.
[time=894] You can catch him by way of the Bible hour, but you can also come to a full concert on Sunday evening. Is that right? That's right at 6 p.m. Rick. He'll be here with us and he'll do the entire service that evening.
[time=906] Well, we hope you'll save Sunday, October the 15th to join us and Bruce Greer on that exciting Sunday. We have a booklet that we've put together here at Blackhawk.
[time=915] I had the privilege of writing it and Tim Teder of our youth staff did the graphics. It's a book that we've titled "How in the World Is It Going to End?"
[time=924] It's a look at the biblical study of prophecy and the end times. If you are like me, you're exposed to a lot of writing and a lot of books and some of them have announced that Jesus was coming back for certain in 1988 and then the revised copy said it's for certain in 1989.
[time=942] And sometimes we're misled by sensationless or sincere people who are overly enthusiastic. That can have a negative effect. It can dampen our spirit and we may miss the real point of being prepared and serving until Christ comes.
[time=957] So we've written the booklet entitled "How in the World Is It Going to End?" and we'd love to send you a copy as a gift from us to you.
[time=965] This is a very informative study and we invite you to write today to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana. The zip code is 46815.
[time=977] Once again write for the booklet and send it to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=988] Thank you Peter. And when you write it is always so encouraging for us to hear how God is using this particular ministry in your life.
[time=998] Just a few days ago I heard from a friend who could hardly contain herself as she shared how her loved one. Somebody she cared about was watching the Bible Hour and what an impact God was having on his life through a ministry that came by way of television.
[time=1014] Has God been using this hour in your life? Could you take a moment? Write us and tell us about it. We'd appreciate that so much. Pete, would you give the address one final time?
[time=1023] Yes, we encourage you to write us today at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1033] Thank you Pete and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour. I hope you'll open your hearts and you'll open your Bible to Luke chapter 7 and begin to study with us the story of a woman with a soiled reputation who comes out smelling like her rose.
[time=1061] This morning I have an opportunity to share with you some great news and an ongoing prayer request.
[time=1068] Over the last few months you've heard us pray for a number of people but two of those young people who are part of our church family, Greg Hindle and Amy Moore.
[time=1078] Greg Hindle discovered that he had leukemia at the end of this summer. His mother is a medical background student and went to her directory of books that were out of date and quickly learned how fatal the disease leukemia can be.
[time=1094] The good news is in Greg's case they caught it early, they gave him some chemotherapy and a lot of other tests and Greg's leukemia is officially in remission and has been for a couple of weeks now.
[time=1108] He will need to go through leukemia, treatment of chemotherapy for a number of months into the future.
[time=1117] Just about the time we learned about Greg, we learned about Amy Moore. Amy is a fourth grader here at Blackhawk and Amy had a rough summer, never feeling 100% but always getting around just fine.
[time=1129] And I remember Rachel went to play with Amy on a Wednesday and came home and said they just had a great time, everything was fine.
[time=1136] By Friday she was at the hospital and by Saturday she was at Riley's Children's Hospital in Indianapolis diagnosed with Burkett's lymphoma, a very harsh form of cancer.
[time=1148] For the last month she and her mom have been there, she has undergone extensive chemotherapy and Friday we learned absolutely fantastic news.
[time=1161] There were lesions on her brain and when they did an MRI on this past week, they're gone. They did a CAT scan of her body and the cancer has been arrested and they did a bone marrow extraction and there is no cancer in her bone marrow.
[time=1179] And we are grateful and we wanted to share that joy with you and invite you to pray with us. God we are overcome by the hurt and the pain that people live with and we are left speechless.
[time=1197] And now today we find ourselves facing tears and speechless tongues again. Maybe that's why we've sung today 04,000 tongues to sing "My Great Redeemer's Praise."
[time=1212] God there isn't enough that we can say our words just won't come. We stand amazed in your presence. We are in all of your power and we thank you for intervening in the lives of these your children.
[time=1228] We thank you for the privilege that is ours to live in a time such as this with doctors and nurses, technology, medications and therapies that weren't available a half a generation ago.
[time=1243] We are grateful for our country for the diligence that has been placed upon medical research. We thank you for a unique place like Riley's Children's Hospital for doctors who have worked nurses and technicians who have labored to bring about these recoveries.
[time=1265] And we also know Father that your hand was in their lives working. And whether it came by medicine or miracle we are grateful to you our God that you have lifted them up.
[time=1278] And we pray that in the days ahead is the undergo maintenance and therapy that you will hold that cancer and check for a lifetime.
[time=1288] We are grateful. We are rejoicing. And we thank you that you've made us to comprehend the value of life and its brevity.
[time=1302] And Father we pray this morning for those who have prayed and you have answered but you have answered no.
[time=1310] We pray this morning for Sherry Berry that you would comfort her and the death of her mother.
[time=1316] We ask you to comfort that one who has prayed for physical healing in their body and nothing has changed.
[time=1323] We ask you to comfort those who have labored and prayed for a restoration and the relationship remains broken.
[time=1332] You choose to answer yes. You choose to answer no. Help us to trust you. And now we give you our lives.
[time=1342] And we ask you to work in our hearts. Make of us spiritual men and women. Not religious people. In Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1355] In Luke chapter 7 we meet an unnamed woman who has an uninvited guest to a party at the house of a man by the name of Simon.
[time=1365] I would like to read you this account of a woman with a soiled reputation who comes out smelling like a rose.
[time=1373] If you have a Bible follow along with your eyes as I read it for you, Luke 7 verse 36 through 50.
[time=1382] Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him. So he went to the Pharisees house and reclined at the table.
[time=1393] When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisees house,
[time=1401] she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears.
[time=1414] Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.
[time=1423] When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him,
[time=1434] and what kind of woman she is, that she is a sinner." Jesus answered him.
[time=1442] "Simon, I have something to say to you. Tell me teacher," he said.
[time=1452] Two men owed money to a certain money lender. One owed him 500 denari, the other 50.
[time=1461] Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the deaths of both.
[time=1467] "Now which one of them will love him more?" Simon replied.
[time=1474] "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled. You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
[time=1485] Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet,
[time=1498] but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss.
[time=1508] But this woman from the time I entered has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil in my head,
[time=1518] but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven, for she loved much.
[time=1531] But he who has been forgiven little loves little." Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
[time=1544] The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who can even forgive sins?" He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."
[time=1574] When she was in love for her Lord, recklessly poured out of value of all their sins, dish-recarding the scroll.
[time=1596] And once it was broken and spun out, a fragrance filled all the room.
[time=1611] Like a prison early least from his shackles, like a spirits and free from the two.
[time=1626] Through minutes filled out, just for love of you Jesus.
[time=1643] My most precious treasure. Let this strong be you.
[time=1660] Look in and spill out, and pour out your feet.
[time=1676] And sweet or burdened, let me be spilled out, and lose to hope.
[time=1695] You've got precious treasure here. He's loved and his own perfect soul.
[time=1713] Said here to show me the love of the Father. Just for love it was done.
[time=1730] And know you're perfect and holy. You gave up yourself willingly.
[time=1746] There's been no expense for my part of you. You lived a thing wasted for me.
[time=1761] Let me be the meaning filled out. Just for love of the Jesus.
[time=1778] God's most precious treasure. Let this strong be you.
[time=1795] Through minutes filled out, and poured out my feet.
[time=1812] And sweet or burdened, let me be spilled out.
[time=1832] And sweet or burdened, let me be spilled out, and lose to hope.
[time=1862] Thank you, Lisa. Here in Luke 7, Jesus introduces us to a woman, woman with a soiled reputation,
[time=1872] who comes out smelling like a rose. Here was a lady who is nameless and faceless.
[time=1879] She goes unidentified, who is now the object of songs and of reputation as one who knew the life-changing power of Christ.
[time=1891] Jesus brings all kinds of people together, and here in this passage he brings two of the least likely people together.
[time=1899] They are this woman and a man by the name of Simon.
[time=1903] This morning what I would like to do is to make five contrasts between those two lives and then conclude with four applications that we can live by.
[time=1913] The first contrast is this. He was from the suburbs, as she from the slums.
[time=1922] Simon is a man of nobility, he is a man of station in life. He lives in the right end of town, in the right neighborhood, in a pretty nice pad.
[time=1933] It's a sizable one. Big enough that he can host some of the civic dinners right in his own courtyard.
[time=1939] Here's how William Barkley, a New Testament writer of history, describes what Simon's house would have been like.
[time=1947] The scene is in the courtyard of the house, of Simon, the Pharisee.
[time=1953] The houses of well-to-do people were built around an open courtyard in the form of a hollow square.
[time=1960] Often in the courtyard there was a garden, even a fountain, and in the warm weather meals were eaten there.
[time=1970] It was the custom in the east that when a rabbi was at a meal in such a house, all kinds of people came in.
[time=1978] They were quite free to do so, to listen to the pearls of wisdom which fell from the rabbi's lips.
[time=1986] This explains the presence of this woman.
[time=1990] Simon was a man of distinction.
[time=1993] He had moved to his end of town because he wanted the right neighborhood and the right atmosphere for his wife and for his children.
[time=2000] She was from the wrong side of the tracks.
[time=2003] If they had lights, she would have been from the red light district.
[time=2008] The Bible doesn't tell us her occupation, but it leaves it to the imagination.
[time=2015] It takes little creativity.
[time=2017] She was a harlot, a prostitute.
[time=2021] She would have never been welcomed in Simon's house, not even on his end of town.
[time=2029] But Jesus is there.
[time=2031] She had probably met Jesus the day before.
[time=2035] She had probably discovered that he and he alone had the ability to change your life, to forgive her of her past and start her fresh and clean.
[time=2043] And where Jesus was, she wanted to be there too.
[time=2048] There's a second contrast.
[time=2050] He was noble.
[time=2052] She was notorious.
[time=2054] Simon had a good name.
[time=2056] Simon is probably the most common name in the New Testament.
[time=2060] There are at least eight others with that name.
[time=2063] It was a popular name.
[time=2065] It was a name that rang of nationalism and patriotism.
[time=2068] It was a name to be proud of.
[time=2071] More than that, he was a Pharisee.
[time=2073] We usually think of the Pharisees as the bad guys because it usually is Jesus over here and the Pharisees over there and hostility being thrown back and forth.
[time=2083] That's not always the case.
[time=2085] In fact, in Luke 1331, it was a small group of the Pharisees who warned Jesus that there was a plot to kill him.
[time=2092] And Jesus' life was saved temporarily by their intervention.
[time=2096] The word Pharisee actually means a separatist.
[time=2100] And as we turn back the pages of U.S. history, we hold the separatists in high esteem.
[time=2106] They were the Puritans, the Pilgrims, the ones who landed in Plymouth on the rock started our country.
[time=2114] To be a Pharisee in that day was a lot like being able to say, I'm part of the daughters of the American Revolution, our daughter of the Mayflower.
[time=2123] It was to be somebody and somebody good.
[time=2127] Simon was noble. He had a nice house, a big one.
[time=2131] It was a house that he opened and he entertained people, even rabbis.
[time=2136] She had entertained men too, but who and when and how often?
[time=2144] Well, those were the secrets of her trade.
[time=2147] But what she did, it was no secret.
[time=2150] Simon knew it. Everybody there knew it.
[time=2153] Everybody except Jesus, it seemed.
[time=2157] Didn't he know she was notorious?
[time=2161] Didn't he know who she was?
[time=2163] Didn't he understand what kind of woman she was?
[time=2166] Why would he let her touch him?
[time=2169] To associate with such a person was an offense?
[time=2173] To allow such a woman to touch him was guilt by incrimination.
[time=2178] Simon was noble and she was notorious.
[time=2183] There's a third contrast between the two, this in the area of hospitality.
[time=2189] What he lacked, she lavished.
[time=2193] In the ancient world there were three customary greetings that you would pay a noteworthy guess to your home.
[time=2200] One of the first things you would do would be to offer them a basin of water and a towel.
[time=2205] Then they could come and they could sit and pour the water over their feet and dry their feet off.
[time=2211] Jerusalem's Department of Roads wasn't much to speak of.
[time=2216] In fact, it wasn't just the dusty, dirty roads, but people had what we'd call bedpans.
[time=2221] What do you do with a bedpan in Compernium? You throw it out the window and the rest of the people are left to walk down the street.
[time=2228] One way that you could really refresh yourself would be to take off your sandals and soak your feet for just a few minutes in some cool water and dry them off.
[time=2239] It's what you gave to anybody who came to your house, a basin of water and a towel.
[time=2246] A second custom would be that after they'd refreshed themselves that you'd put your hands on their shoulders and they are yours.
[time=2253] Then you would lean to the side and kiss each other's opposite cheek.
[time=2258] I have a brother-in-law, godly Christian, he's Lebanese, Nino Shabib, and whenever I see Nino we greet that way.
[time=2266] That's part of their culture, even to this day.
[time=2269] A third way that you treated a guest to your house was to take some oil and to wipe their brow with the oil.
[time=2276] It would wipe the dust away and would add a little bit more pleasant aroma that they might not have had when they came in.
[time=2283] To us, that sounds kind of strange and foreign, but you know we do it just a little more subtly, even to this day.
[time=2291] If you're like me, your usual golf outing takes you to the local floodplain.
[time=2296] The restrooms are something that only a man in hazmat gear would enter, but not all golf courses are like that.
[time=2303] In fact, with my father or our friend, I've had the privilege of playing in some really nice country clubs and the atmosphere is completely different.
[time=2310] In fact, the locker rooms are so big and glamorous five or six of our families could move in and never see each other.
[time=2318] In fact, when you walk into these golf courses and you take off your shoes to put on your golf spikes,
[time=2324] a gentleman will come around and he will pick up your shoes and he will polish them and clean them
[time=2330] and put a little talcum powder in them so after you've played your 18 holes, your feet have some comfort to call home.
[time=2336] And when you walk up to the vanity, they not only provide you with a comb to comb your hair, but a razor, shaving cream, aftershave, cologne, anything you need to anoint your head.
[time=2347] A little vitalis, they even have this stuff called Osage Rub.
[time=2351] I've used it about 10 times at my dad's golf course. I don't know what it is, but it's really neat stuff.
[time=2358] You just take this Osage Rub and you splash it on your face, put a little on your neck, and it not only feels good when the alcohol evaporates, it makes you smell kind of manly and all.
[time=2368] That's all they were doing, giving you a little oil and cleaning up your shoes and helping you to relax.
[time=2374] It was the typical hospitality of the day, but it was omitted in Jesus' case.
[time=2382] He'd come to Simon's house, there was no basin of water, there was no greeting of a holy kiss.
[time=2387] There was no oil to anoint his head.
[time=2390] It makes you wonder why did Simon even invite Jesus there? We can only speculate.
[time=2398] Someone has suggested he brought him there to humiliate him.
[time=2402] He brought him there to make a public spectacle of himself and then stood back and said,
[time=2409] "What is this from Nazareth? Let's distance ourself from him." Others have suggested that Simon brought him there hoping to ask a question to entrap him and trick him
[time=2421] to discredit him with the masses who were already saying he is a prophet.
[time=2427] Probably Simon invited him there because Jesus was a somebody and if Simon had him for dinner,
[time=2434] he would be a somebody too.
[time=2436] A little social ladder climbing was probably this occasion.
[time=2440] Simon invites Jesus there, but he lacks the general rules of hospitality.
[time=2447] But with Simon lacked, this woman lavished.
[time=2451] We need to paint a little picture for you so you can see how people ate.
[time=2456] We usually think of people pulling up to a table, sitting down with a plate in front of them silverware,
[time=2462] two forks, not sure what the second one is for, three dishes, don't know what the third one is for, two glasses of water and I always looked at my wife to see which do I drink from.
[time=2471] It wasn't an affair like that at all.
[time=2473] As a matter of fact, you didn't sit, you reclined.
[time=2477] You were probably at a table all maybe eight inches, twelve inches high at the most.
[time=2483] You would typically lean up at the table on one arm and stretch your body away from the table
[time=2490] with your feet at the furthest end and then you'd use your right hand to feed yourself.
[time=2496] It was a deliberately slow and casual way of dining.
[time=2502] Jesus is in that position in the courtyard around the table of Simon.
[time=2509] In the shadows of the bushes, in between the rocks, the fountains and the landscaping,
[time=2515] the common people have come to listen.
[time=2518] They were not invited but the gate was purposely left open.
[time=2523] A group of people had begun to swell.
[time=2526] And then unexpectedly, one of those common people did something that was very uncommon.
[time=2534] She broke out of the pack and she approached Jesus.
[time=2538] His feet extended away from the table were conspicuous.
[time=2542] She walked up to them and began to hold his feet.
[time=2547] And she began to cry.
[time=2550] It was a combination of guilt over her past and joy over her future.
[time=2555] Christ had already met her.
[time=2557] He had already forgiven her sins and she stood there much like I am today.
[time=2563] I weep when I hear about Greg and Amy and then I cry for joy when I hear they're better.
[time=2568] And both of those tears spilled down her mascara straight face and began to drip on Jesus' feet
[time=2574] to the point they were literally wet.
[time=2578] Then she undid the knot in her hair.
[time=2584] And she turned her head to one side and the locks fall long and flowing under Jesus' feet.
[time=2592] And she wrapped her hair around his feet and ceremoniously dried them.
[time=2598] She began to kiss him on the feet.
[time=2604] And then from inside her robe, she pulled out an alabaster jar, broke it open.
[time=2611] And instantly, when that broke open, perfume, the scent, the smell of it all began to fill the room.
[time=2620] And she took that and poured it not on his head, but on his feet.
[time=2628] The moment she approached, every eye turned in her direction.
[time=2633] But out of discretion, people would turn and look back at Simon or Jesus trying to take the attention off her.
[time=2639] But when that perfume filled the room, everyone had to turn.
[time=2644] Too many of their senses were involved.
[time=2646] They could see her.
[time=2648] They could hear those sobbing and now they could smell the perfume.
[time=2655] What a difference between Simon and this woman.
[time=2660] There is a fourth comparison or contrast between the two.
[time=2665] Spiritually, he was critical.
[time=2670] She was contrite.
[time=2673] Simon never says a word at this point.
[time=2676] The perfume has begun to fill the air.
[time=2679] And he has closed mouth, but eyes wide open.
[time=2685] And he begins to think in his mind.
[time=2689] His first thought is criticism of her.
[time=2692] Who is she?
[time=2693] I mean, I know who she is, but who does she think she is?
[time=2696] Coming to my house and approaching my guests.
[time=2700] And what's wrong with Jesus?
[time=2702] I mean, if he were a prophet, like people say, then he would know who it is that's touching him.
[time=2709] And he would know what kind of woman she was and he wouldn't tolerate this for a moment.
[time=2716] Simon's instincts were to be critical of the woman and of Jesus.
[time=2722] The woman wasn't critical of anybody.
[time=2725] She was contrite.
[time=2727] She was broken.
[time=2730] She could not stop expressing both her joy and her remorse.
[time=2737] She didn't come with any pretense.
[time=2740] She had no self-righteousness.
[time=2743] She could only say, "I'm a sinner in need of a Savior." And approach the feet of Jesus.
[time=2751] A fifth and final contrast is this.
[time=2755] Simon raised a stink and she came away smelling like a rose.
[time=2763] Simon was going through all of these gestures and emotions and thoughts and he was upset.
[time=2770] This wasn't right.
[time=2771] It shouldn't be happening.
[time=2772] It shouldn't be happening at my house, at my party.
[time=2776] Thinking that he was going to elevate himself and put her down.
[time=2779] Before the conversation ends, the roles have been reversed.
[time=2784] And she comes out, approved, and he comes away, condemned.
[time=2791] Strange paradox, isn't it?
[time=2793] A good parable is brought in to elucidate this point.
[time=2799] Jesus begins to tell the story of two men who went to the same lender and borrowed money.
[time=2806] One 500 denari, the other 50.
[time=2811] A denarias is about one day's wage for a working man.
[time=2817] Neither one of them had the ability to pay back the debt.
[time=2820] And so the lending agency canceled both debts.
[time=2824] I've been looking for that institution.
[time=2826] Haven't found it yet in Fort Wayne.
[time=2830] Jesus then, having told the story, turns to Simon and says to Simon, "Simon, who do you think loved him the most?" And Simon is a bit perturbed.
[time=2843] He's put on the spot.
[time=2845] He reluctantly answers, "I suppose the one whose debt was the largest."
[time=2853] Jesus said, "That's right." And then condemns Simon for his lack of hospitality and commends the woman for her lavish of hospitality.
[time=2868] And the man who raised the stink is in trouble.
[time=2874] Please don't misunderstand.
[time=2876] A man by the name of Kevin Modlan makes this good note.
[time=2880] Nothing indicates that Jesus took the woman's tears lightly or that he dismissed her sins as nothing.
[time=2888] It is her love that is heralded, not her misdeeds.
[time=2892] It is her consciousness of sin, not her sin that is commended.
[time=2899] That leads me to the four applications that I wanted to share with you today.
[time=2904] The first application that we can grow by is this one.
[time=2908] It's not the amount of sin but the awareness of sin that is an issue with God.
[time=2915] Thanks, Kevin.
[time=2916] You couldn't have sung a better song than the one that says, "There's not one." There's not one of us here who can say, "Whew.
[time=2925] I'm glad this story is about a woman of ill-repute because I'm off the hook." We can't say that.
[time=2932] The Bible says there's none righteous.
[time=2935] No, not even one.
[time=2938] There's none that understands.
[time=2940] There's none that seeks after God.
[time=2942] No, not one.
[time=2945] Not even you, Simon.
[time=2948] Not one.
[time=2950] Simon was a man who looked at things rather qualitatively.
[time=2954] He looked at her life and to produce a list of her sins, you simply needed the local phone book.
[time=2961] While he was impeccable, he viewed his life as in very little need spiritually, her is in very great need.
[time=2973] And yet by the time the story ends, the emphasis is on her spiritual forgiveness and Simon's need of the same.
[time=2983] You see with God, the issue isn't how many sins did you commit.
[time=2989] The amount is incidental because whosoever keeps the entire law yet breaks it.
[time=2995] Just one point is guilty of it all.
[time=2998] Let me illustrate this way.
[time=2999] If you're being rescued by a helicopter with a chain and the helicopter has pulled you half way out of the fire,
[time=3006] how many links have to be broken before you fall again?
[time=3010] Just one.
[time=3012] If you and I are so moral and so upright that we only sin once the chain of perfection is broken and we are guilty.
[time=3023] You see with God, it's not the amount of sin.
[time=3026] He can handle small counts and big accounts.
[time=3029] The issue with God is awareness of sin and that is where Simon blew it and the woman did shine.
[time=3040] Simon didn't say a word, but he's exactly like one of his Pharisaical brothers who appears later in Luke
[time=3046] who literally goes into a temple, a synagogue, a church much like this and stands up when the pastor asks for three people to pray and he stands up and he prays, "Oh God, thank you, I'm not like the rest of this motley crew."
[time=3062] Totally oblivious to his own need and insensitive to the world around him.
[time=3068] With God, it's not the amount of our sin.
[time=3071] It's our awareness of it.
[time=3073] Warren Wearsby writes these words.
[time=3077] "The parable does not deal with the amount of sin in a person's life but the awareness of sin in their heart."
[time=3083] How much sin must a person commit to be a sinner?
[time=3087] Simon and the woman were both sinners.
[time=3090] Simon was guilty of sins of the spirit, especially pride, while the woman was guilty of sins of the flesh.
[time=3099] Her sins were known.
[time=3101] Simon's sins were hidden to everyone except God.
[time=3107] And both of them were bankrupt and could not pay their debt to God.
[time=3113] Simon was just as spiritually bankrupt as the woman, only he did not realize it.
[time=3121] One of the grave mistakes we could make when we read this passage is to become a Pharisee ourselves and to say, "Wow, that woman really did need Jesus.
[time=3130] I don't fit into her camp." Simon and this woman were identical.
[time=3137] They both were sinners.
[time=3139] It was only a matter of degrees.
[time=3144] Psalm 51 says, "A broken and contrite heart, oh God,
[time=3150] you will not reject." You know today, no matter how many or how few, your sins may be or mine, God's sins ready to forgive them all, great or small.
[time=3162] A second application I had bring to your attention is this one.
[time=3165] It is possible to be very religious and not be spiritual at the same time.
[time=3174] It is possible to be religious without being spiritual.
[time=3179] Again, look at Simon.
[time=3182] Here was a man who was a religious separatist.
[time=3185] I mean, when you looked at this guy, you said clean.
[time=3189] When you looked at this guy, you said, "Wax the straight and narrow." When you talk to this man impeccable, there wasn't a church service that he didn't attend.
[time=3202] There wasn't a missions banquet that he didn't bring the biggest dish.
[time=3206] There wasn't a plea for volunteers that he wasn't one of the first to show up.
[time=3211] And though it wasn't most supposed to be public record, he liked to leak it out.
[time=3215] He was one of the bigger givers at that place too.
[time=3219] I mean, he was religions right down to his bones.
[time=3224] And yet, he wasn't spiritual at all.
[time=3227] In fact, he was both spiritually blind and spiritually dead.
[time=3233] There is a most fascinating play on words in this whole narrative.
[time=3241] Simon begins the play by saying, "Doesn't Jesus know who she is?
[time=3249] Doesn't he see what she's doing?
[time=3252] Doesn't he know what's going on?" And then at the end of the narrative, Jesus says, "Simon, don't you see this woman?
[time=3265] Don't you know what's going on?
[time=3268] Can't you see what's happening here?" Simon thought that he saw what kind of woman she was.
[time=3277] And Jesus didn't know what kind of woman she had been.
[time=3281] The truth of the matter is this, Simon didn't know what kind of man he was
[time=3287] or what kind of man Jesus was either.
[time=3291] Wears to be again here as worth quoting when he notes, "Before this dinner is over, it's a warm meal and a cool reception." For Simon learned a whole lot about himself, he really didn't care to know.
[time=3305] He was religious, but he wasn't spiritual.
[time=3309] We can run that same danger.
[time=3311] We can say, "I go to church.
[time=3313] I go to Blackhawk.
[time=3315] I help out all the time." Did you see that little landscaping job while that?
[time=3320] I just happened to do that.
[time=3322] Oh, I've been working in children.
[time=3324] Now I'm going to do double duty in a wana.
[time=3326] Boy, when I get to heaven, they'll be crowns for me.
[time=3329] Not necessarily.
[time=3331] You can serve.
[time=3333] You can be religious and maybe still not no forgiveness because you haven't asked Christ in your heart.
[time=3341] The third application is this one.
[time=3345] All of our lives leave a fragrance behind.
[time=3351] The only fragrance that day was not just the perfume that was spilled out, but her life left a fragrance everywhere she went.
[time=3359] There were going to be those who say, "Oh, I know you.
[time=3363] I know what you're like.
[time=3365] How much is it this weekend?" And she could spill out the fragrance one more time and say, "There'll be no more weekends.
[time=3373] No more one night stands.
[time=3375] My life's been changed." Augustine, before he became a Christian and a theologian, was a deep, deep center.
[time=3385] Sexual lewdness was one of his specialties in vice.
[time=3390] After he came to Christ, he was walking through a familiar street and a familiar woman came to him.
[time=3397] "And you're Augustine.
[time=3398] Augustine!" he ignored her.
[time=3401] And she turned him around to the Guston.
[time=3404] "It is I." And Augustine said, "Yes, but it is no longer I." And he walked away.
[time=3413] This woman walked away, obeying Jesus' words to another, just like her, and said no more and left a new fragrance.
[time=3421] Paul put these words to Penn in 2 Corinthians chapter 2.
[time=3428] "But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ, and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.
[time=3439] For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved
[time=3445] and those who are perishing.
[time=3447] To the one we are the smell of death to the other, the fragrance of life." I hope you've been stinking up your office this week, leaving the fragrance of a changed life of Christ there.
[time=3461] The fourth application I would give you is this one.
[time=3464] Christ can change anybody's life.
[time=3469] Whether you're a Simon or an unknown woman from the streets, Jesus can change your life.
[time=3486] [MUSIC]
[time=3492] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of music from our choir and orchestra, and soloist Kevin Rowe and Lisa Reniker.
[time=3499] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3502] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3507] Just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3511] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3513] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm grateful that you sent your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3520] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3524] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3529] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3534] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3538] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
