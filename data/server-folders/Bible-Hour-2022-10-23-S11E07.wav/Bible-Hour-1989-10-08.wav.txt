[time=277] in your presence. There is peace, there is peace. And we speak to know your heart. We will find such blessed assurance in your holy presence.
[time=306] There can be such sweet reward, when we wait upon the Lord. As we take the time He gives His perfect wisdom.
[time=332] To be found in Him alone. All our deep, the sick, breaststone, is surrounded by His grace, when we seek His grace.
[time=353] In His presence. In His presence. In His presence. There is peace. When we seek the Father's heart.
[time=381] We will find such blessed assurance. And never again told to know or say your home. In the presence of our Lord.

[time=590] It is our tool making it true.
[time=596] All our sins and griefs to bear.
[time=604] What a privilege it is to make our request known to the Lord and find that He is faithful.
[time=609] We continue with music now as we listen with our hearts and our ears to Brian Loosen as he comes to minister to us.
[time=634] For the glory of the Lord, we have been created.

[time=812] Welcome to the Bible Hour today, and thanks for joining us.
[time=822] I certainly hope our first few moments together have been a rich spiritual encouragement to you.
[time=828] Pete, we're looking forward to Bruce Greer being here with us.
[time=832] Rick, we've talked for a number of weeks about Bruce coming and he called me this week and just asked if all was well.
[time=837] I assured him that we were excited about his coming.
[time=840] If you're watching today, October 15th is when Bruce will be with us, and you can get up even this morning.
[time=846] If you're in Fort Wayne area and join us for the 9/15 service or the 10/50 or in the evening at 6 p.m.
[time=853] Bruce is a fine pianist, he's going to join our choir and orchestra and our pianist Scott Schindler for our concert in the morning and then a full concert in the evening.
[time=862] What a grand time we're going to have.
[time=864] I'm looking forward to that and I'm so excited that he's going to play and the choir is going to sing along on that great hymn that he wrote for our church's dedication.
[time=873] Just about a year ago, Rick, he wrote the song "The Lord Rains" and we're going to sing that again this Sunday morning.
[time=879] That is such a powerful song and I do hope you friends who are in the greater Fort Wayne area will get up, get moving and join us right now so you can be a part of this exciting day.
[time=889] Worshipping the Lord and Bruce Greer being a part of that.
[time=892] A few weeks ago, my wife Kathy was here to tell you ladies about a women's retreat that we'll be having here in Fort Wayne coming up on the weekend of October 20th and 21st.
[time=903] Our senator Dan Coates' wife, Marsha, will be the featured speaker.
[time=908] We have admired them as great leaders both politically and spiritually.
[time=914] If you'd like information about the women's retreat, I want to invite you to call us here at Blackhawk Monday through Friday at 493 7400.
[time=925] And then before we go back to the morning worship service, we have a booklet to share with you.
[time=930] It's title is this. How in the world is it going to end?
[time=935] This is a study that we've put together here at Blackhawk.
[time=938] I had the privilege of writing it and my friend Tim Teder did the graphics.
[time=942] We have written this book because of a great deal of confusion about that question.
[time=947] How is the world going to end?
[time=950] I remember a year ago, Pete, a book came out with proof positive.
[time=953] 88 reasons why Christ was coming in 1988.
[time=957] Well, obviously it's 1989 and Christ has not returned.
[time=961] I really admire the sincerity of people who believe they know when Christ is going to come.
[time=967] But I also am sensitive to the damage that's done because after a while we begin to say, who can we believe?
[time=974] What can we trust out of the Bible?
[time=976] So we've tried to pen a rational approach to this question, how in the world is it going to end?
[time=982] And we'd send a copy to you as a gift from us to you if you'll simply write and ask for it.
[time=988] You can receive this helpful study guide by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1000] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1009] Thank you, Pete, and before we go back to our morning worship service, let me again invite you friends in the Greater Fort Wayne area to get with us today on October the 15th for Bruce Greer.
[time=1021] Our church is located on the East edge of Fort Wayne on State Boulevard, where it's 7,400 East State Boulevard, just about a mile past Georgetown Shopping Center.
[time=1032] We'll look forward to seeing you.
[time=1039] [MUSIC - 46 seconds]
[time=1088] My light, rich as I heed not, more man's empty praise, though mine in heritage, though and always,
[time=1110] though only, first in my heart, high king of heaven, my treasure, thou art.
[time=1140] High king of heaven, I victory one.
[time=1154] May I reach heaven's joys, who bright heaven's own.
[time=1165] Heart of man of heaven, won't ever be far.
[time=1182] Still be my vision,
[time=1191] all ruler of all.
[time=1200] Still be my vision,
[time=1209] all ruler of all.
[time=1226] Thank you, Starr, and I invite you that we might bow and pray together.
[time=1231] God, you are ruler of all.
[time=1234] We ask you to be the very vision of our lives.
[time=1237] We ask you to be that one that gives light and direction.
[time=1242] We ask you to give life and a certain sense of purpose to those who we might call the up and outers,
[time=1252] those who have achieved their position in life, whose dreams have been fulfilled, whose needs have been met,
[time=1259] and yet amidst all of their abundance, there is a corresponding emptiness.
[time=1266] Oh, God, may they today know that Jesus Christ is the one that gives life and who gives it more abundantly.
[time=1273] Father, we pray that you would be the vision of that one who we might think of as a down and outer,
[time=1279] that one who has gone through a job reversal, a demotion,
[time=1285] one who has been passed over and someone less trained, less capable, has been promoted in their place.
[time=1293] We pray for those who are unemployed or underemployed, that you would give to them a sense of security and life in that they know you.
[time=1303] We pray for those who walk through the hard valleys.
[time=1307] We would ask you to give strength to the bodies of Desi Bennett, and little Brandon Burkauer, and for Benjamin Wigan,
[time=1317] that they might recover from all that has hit their bodies.
[time=1321] We pray for Alice Flowers that she'll grow strong after her surgery.
[time=1325] We invite you, God, to do surgery on our hearts today.
[time=1330] We ask you to make us known to ourselves that let us hide behind our suits and ties,
[time=1338] or the outward appearance of good deeds and works well done.
[time=1344] Help us to know what our true motives and our true hearts are.
[time=1348] Help us today to learn to live in a way that would please you.
[time=1352] Help us today to know your strength in our emotional battles.
[time=1359] We pray for those who are fighting cancer, for Amy Moore, that though there's good news that you'll continue to encourage the same for Gray, and for other friends who are carrying their burden silently and secretly.
[time=1374] Others of us are battling our tongue and our temper, and we too would ask for your help. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1386] Church bulletins can not only give you news of the congregation, but they can be a source of great, great humor.
[time=1394] One time, the Secretary of a given Church forgot to announce that what she was typing was the Sunday morning service, and the next line was the Sunday evening service.
[time=1405] So without explanation, she typed these two lines, one below the other.
[time=1410] One was, "What hell was like?" The second line was, "Come here, our choir." Now, it was supposed to be the introduction to the morning service, and then the introduction to the evening service, but it didn't come across quite that way.
[time=1425] On another occasion, the pastor was on vacation.
[time=1428] His Secretary called him and said, "We're doing the bulletin for the Sunday when you get back, and I need to know the titles of your messages." He said, "Well, on Sunday night, I'm going to speak out of Proverbs that passage, the fool has said in his heart there is no God." And to be honest, I'm not prepared for Sunday morning, but don't be glad that I'm back, so just put down that the pastor will be home.
[time=1450] So the bulletin read like this, "The pastor speaks Sunday night, what the fool said." Now, you may not have ever made quite those glaring of errors, but think of this poor young pastor.
[time=1464] He went to his first church, and he wanted to impress them, that he was well-equipped and well-prepared to be their pastor.
[time=1471] The most intimidating moment for him was when he was to administer the church ordinances, so he memorized everything, what you say, communion, what you say, baptism.
[time=1480] He learned how to do a wedding, dearly beloved, we were gathered here, and I mean, he had all the lines down, but he was a little nervous.
[time=1488] So he's doing baptism for the first time, and this dear man gave a great testimony how he had given his heart to Christ.
[time=1494] And the pastor stepped next to him, raised his hand, and said, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, drink ye all of it," and he pushed him right under the water.
[time=1506] I don't know if you've ever made just a little full paw, a little foot in the mouth.
[time=1511] I made a very, very serious one.
[time=1515] It was the first date that Cathy and I ever had.
[time=1518] I went to her house to pick her up.
[time=1520] I went into her home and greeted her family, and soon in the conversation, this particular establishment in Akron, Ohio, hometown, came to surface.
[time=1531] Well, I quickly told what a sleaze operation I thought that business was and how the leader of that organization wasn't worth a dime, and I went on and on for about ten minutes.
[time=1542] Cathy ushered me out the door, we got in our car, and she said, "My mother works there and thinks it's a great place." Well, my future mother-in-law got over that, and, oh, three or four years, it was no big deal.
[time=1556] The tables turned.
[time=1558] We had some guests from another church, a whole different type of ministry over to our house, and our guests said, "What did you think of a certain television special?" And Cathy said, "Oh, I thought it was pretty hokey.
[time=1573] I'm drifting behind our gas going." And she went on about as long as I did in her living room ten years earlier.
[time=1582] And finally I said, "Honey, you may not know, but this is one of the singers of the television special." Cathy said, "I'm going to go check on the dessert." Putting our foot in our mouth is often an occupational hazard, whether you make your living talking or not.
[time=1601] Peter was such a guy.
[time=1603] John MacArthur called him the disciple with the foot-shaped mouth.
[time=1607] So I'd like to borrow that insight and title today's message "An Impetuous Man with a Foot-shaped Mouth." In the life of Peter, if we examine three days in the life of Peter, we can learn three lessons from the school of hard knocks at his expense.
[time=1623] If you have a Bible, turn to Matthew chapter 16.
[time=1627] This is one of Peter's grand occasions.
[time=1630] He comes out swinging.
[time=1632] His first time at bat, he hits a home run.
[time=1635] The second time with the play, he causes the game losing air.
[time=1641] Matthew chapter 16, here's how verse 13 begins the narrative.
[time=1646] "When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the son of man is?" They replied.
[time=1657] Some say John the Baptist.
[time=1659] Others say Elijah.
[time=1661] And still others, Jeremiah are one of the prophets.
[time=1666] "But what about you?" he said.
[time=1670] "Who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered.
[time=1676] "You are the Christ, the son of the living God." Jesus replied.
[time=1683] "Blessed are you, Simon's son of Jonah.
[time=1686] For this was not revealed to you by man, but by my father in heaven."
[time=1694] Jesus' ministry has gone public and in the phraseology of today, he was on a roll.
[time=1701] He had just fed 5,000 people with a carryout dinner from Long John Silver's.
[time=1707] People were impressed.
[time=1709] Then he took the Pharisees on face to face and put them in their place.
[time=1714] Then he walked on water and did a final encore by feeding 4,000 people
[time=1720] at one time miraculously.
[time=1723] I mean the whole land of Israel was on a buzz.
[time=1727] Who is Jesus?
[time=1728] How can he do these things?
[time=1730] But the consensus of popular opinion was this.
[time=1733] He's a great man, truly a prophet, maybe even on a par with the Hall of Famers.
[time=1740] Elijah, John the Baptist and Moses.
[time=1745] But that's all they would say.
[time=1747] A great man, a great prophet, but limited it to that.
[time=1752] Jesus changes it from a Gallup poll surveying popular opinion.
[time=1757] Points an indicting finger at his 12 disciples.
[time=1760] Who do you say that I am?
[time=1763] And Peter is impulsive.
[time=1766] He is impetuous.
[time=1768] He has never heard the principle put mind in gear before mouth in motion.
[time=1775] Never crossed his mind.
[time=1777] And so he blurts out instinctively what's crossing his mind.
[time=1781] And he says, "Right, you're the Christ, the Son of the Living God." And I can almost picture Peter gone.
[time=1789] Did I say that?
[time=1791] And then staring for approval, but stepping back in case he spoke a miss.
[time=1798] And Jesus said, "Where did it go, Peter?
[time=1801] Way to go, Son of Jonah.
[time=1804] You're right." And not only are you right, this insight didn't come to you by collective wisdom of this crowd.
[time=1812] Somehow God's given you the insight to come to this conclusion.
[time=1817] I can see Peter kind of straightening his token, tightening his loincloth, and looking to the others like, "I bet you wish you had come up with that answer."
[time=1827] Jesus goes on to compliment him and to commend him.
[time=1830] And Peter is just, I mean, he's ecstatic.
[time=1833] I mean, he has really got it right this time.
[time=1836] In the lifetime, even Peter came out with the right words.
[time=1841] Unfortunately, that cocked his tongue like a hair trigger, and he was ready to answer every question.
[time=1846] I mean, have you ever noticed in a classroom once a kid gets an answer right, how they want to answer every question after that?
[time=1855] Peter was that man.
[time=1858] And Jesus, on the same day, in the same conversation, turns the conversation
[time=1864] and in verse 21 he begins to tell him that he's going to go to Jerusalem, that he's going to suffer, that his enemies are going to triumph over him, and he is going to die and rise again.
[time=1877] And Peter puts it all into motion again.
[time=1881] Brain is not engaged, mouth is in full speed, and he gets up out of the crowd
[time=1887] and he literally walks over, puts his arm around Jesus and just holds it here a minute.
[time=1892] You don't need to say more.
[time=1894] And he leads Jesus aside and he says, Jesus, you're wrong.
[time=1900] This will never happen.
[time=1902] Never, Lord.
[time=1905] Then Peter kind of pauses thinking Jesus is going to say, wow, Peter, you really are sharp.
[time=1911] I mean, it's just one good idea after another.
[time=1914] He pulled up his toga, tightened up his loincloth, struck a pose for the other 12, and Jesus is just about to say, why to go, Peter?
[time=1923] And here's what Jesus says.
[time=1926] Peter, you get behind me.
[time=1931] Satan?
[time=1933] Wow.
[time=1935] Just a moment ago, Peter made an answer and he got commended and he was told that his insight came from God.
[time=1942] Now he makes another instinctive comment and he gets condemned and told that his insight
[time=1948] came from the gates of heaven but out of the pit of hell.
[time=1953] He blew it and he blew it in a big way.
[time=1959] That's one day in the life of Peter.
[time=1961] Let's move ahead one book of the Bible and three years in time to mark chapter 14, verse 27.
[time=1971] A lot of time has gone by and Peter has opened his mouth repeatedly in between these two days.
[time=1977] Sometimes he said absolutely the right thing and other times.
[time=1981] The only time he opened his mouth was to switch feet.
[time=1986] In Mark chapter 14, it's again one of those high moments.
[time=1991] The people from the north Galilee have migrated to the south following Jesus.
[time=1998] And when Jesus centers the capital of Jerusalem, they have lined the streets and they have shouted, here he is, this is the one Messiah Christ.
[time=2006] He's going to be the king.
[time=2008] He's going to get rid of the Romans.
[time=2010] Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=2014] And as Christ wrote in, there was Peter right behind him kind of going.
[time=2018] Playing the crowd, remember me, Caesarea Philippi.
[time=2020] I was the first guy to say he's the Messiah.
[time=2022] The rest of you are finally catching on from the guy you want to look to.
[time=2027] And a good week goes by and Christ takes them to a place that we only know is the upper room.
[time=2032] And Christ starts back in this same talk again.
[time=2037] He says the hour has come.
[time=2040] The days upon me, I'm going to die.
[time=2045] Pick up the narrative in Mark 14, 27.
[time=2049] Jesus looks at his disciples and says, "You will all fall away."
[time=2056] Jesus told them, "For it is written.
[time=2059] I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.
[time=2064] But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
[time=2070] Peter declared, "Oh, even if all men fall away, I will not."
[time=2081] I tell you the truth, Jesus answered today.
[time=2085] "Yes, tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny me three times."
[time=2097] But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you."
[time=2105] And all the others said the same.
[time=2111] The second day of our examination of Peter's life, we find him the same, impulsive, impetuous,
[time=2119] saying instinctively whatever crosses his mind.
[time=2123] He hasn't reasoned anything out.
[time=2125] He's only blirting his intentions out of sincere emotion, but unfounded logic.
[time=2131] He hasn't listened to what Christ had said.
[time=2134] Oh, he heard the death part, but he missed the resurrection part of it.
[time=2139] He was so busy thinking about how he was going to answer.
[time=2143] He didn't hear what the teacher had to say.
[time=2148] And he boldly and brashly announces that he would never disown Christ.
[time=2155] If you've been around church Sunday school or Bible stories much, you have heard before today of what became a Peter that night.
[time=2165] Jesus was arrested in the garden.
[time=2167] He was taken to Caiaphas house, and there he was arraigned in a kangaroo court.
[time=2172] There wasn't a thing legal about it.
[time=2174] Every law of jurisprudence was broken in the trial of Christ.
[time=2180] Many people gathered in the courtyard of Caiaphas' house.
[time=2184] They could hear the shouts of the high priest, "Are you the Messiah?
[time=2188] Are you God?" They listened quietly, they would be able to hear if Jesus would respond.
[time=2199] Most of the crowd was silent, but you know who talked, Peter.
[time=2205] And a lady who was a servant of Caiaphas working in the courtyard looked at Peter and said,
[time=2212] "I've seen you before.
[time=2215] I've seen you with Jesus." And instantly Peter speaks impetuously again.
[time=2221] "Oh no, you're mistaken.
[time=2223] I don't even know Jesus.
[time=2225] I just mingled in with the crowd to see what was going to come of it all." But she priced the issue.
[time=2232] She insisted again, "No, I remember.
[time=2236] Maybe it was the day he came writing to tell I think you were right behind him.
[time=2242] So you, it was you." And Peter says, "I'm telling you, I don't even know the man."
[time=2250] The more he talked, the more his words indicted himself.
[time=2254] Someone came up and said, "Talk kind of different.
[time=2258] You don't talk like we do in the city.
[time=2260] You sound more like country folk.
[time=2262] You sound like you're from the north.
[time=2264] Galilee, if my ear detects your dialect, you're a Galilean.
[time=2270] She's right, isn't she?
[time=2272] You came down here with Jesus.
[time=2274] And Peter swore and he cursed.
[time=2278] And with explicative means he said, "I don't know him."
[time=2284] As he blurted that out for the third time, the arrival of mourning was announced by the second crow of the rooster.
[time=2294] Peter denied Christ three times.
[time=2298] Just as he was quick on the draw to say, "I'll never deny you." He was equally fast to say, "I never knew him." He began by swearing an oath, though all men turn away, "I will not."
[time=2314] And he ended by swearing an angry, "I don't even know the guy." Impulsive, impetuous, too quick to speak.
[time=2326] That concludes the second day of our examination.
[time=2330] Turn a page or two to Mark 16 to a third day in the life of Peter.
[time=2337] The trial has ended.
[time=2340] A sentence has been passed and the execution has been carried out.
[time=2345] Jesus is dead.
[time=2349] His words fulfilled.
[time=2352] The shepherd was smitten and the sheep were scattered.
[time=2356] The disciples were not there to be found at this trial before Pilate.
[time=2362] They were not there to watch his execution.
[time=2364] They were not there to care for his body.
[time=2367] Two relatively outsiders, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus,
[time=2373] care for the body.
[time=2376] The close allies, these disciples who said, "We'll die with you," are clandestinely hidden in the closet.
[time=2384] We don't know where, but they're in seclusion.
[time=2387] They're afraid to walk out in the streets because the public mood of the day is, "Let's seize all of the Galileans." Anybody who had anything to do with Christ, we've got enough crosses.
[time=2397] Let's do them all in.
[time=2400] So Peter and the others are hiding.
[time=2404] But in a moment of bravery, they push the women out the door to care for Jesus' body.
[time=2409] The women go to the tomb and they find an angel present,
[time=2415] and Jesus absent.
[time=2419] Here's Mark 16, verse 4.
[time=2423] But when they, meaning the ladies, looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.
[time=2431] As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
[time=2440] "Don't be alarmed," he said.
[time=2443] "You are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who was crucified.
[time=2447] He has risen. He is not here." See the place where they laid him?
[time=2454] But go.
[time=2456] Tell his disciples and Peter.
[time=2463] He is going ahead of you into Galilee.
[time=2465] There you will see him just as he told you.
[time=2470] On this third day, in our examination of the life of Peter,
[time=2476] we are amazed at how magnanimous God's grace really is.
[time=2484] Peter, who boldly said, "I'll never deny you," was the first to do so.
[time=2488] Peter, who said, "I'll die if that's what it takes as hiding, crouching somewhere." And Christ has his angel say, "Go tell those cowardly disciples that I'm alive.
[time=2503] Tell them to come back where it's a little safer to Galilee.
[time=2506] Tell them all to come." And then he particularly names Peter.
[time=2514] Isn't God's grace wonderful that he would take the worst of us and personally invite us to come to him?
[time=2523] I'd like to take three lessons out of this that we can learn from Peter's score of hard knocks, so we may not have to learn them ourselves.
[time=2533] The first lesson I would suggest is this one.
[time=2536] Wise people watch their words.
[time=2542] Allow me a quick tour through four or five of the proverbs.
[time=2547] Most are proverbs of Solomon.
[time=2550] Here's Proverbs 10, 19.
[time=2554] When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise.
[time=2563] Proverbs 13 and verse 3.
[time=2568] He who guards his lips, guards his life.
[time=2573] But he who speaks rashly will come to ruin.
[time=2577] We're asking you to memorize Proverbs 17, 27 this month.
[time=2582] It gives the same admonition.
[time=2585] A man of knowledge uses words with restraint.
[time=2589] A man of understanding is even tempered.
[time=2595] Between the services, a friend came up to me and said, I heard this poem, it illustrates what you're trying to say.
[time=2601] I liked it so well, I tried to scribble it down to share with you.
[time=2604] I always watch the words I say to keep them short and sweet because I never know from day to day which ones of those I might have to eat.
[time=2614] Pretty good advice, isn't it?
[time=2617] James chapter 1 and verse 19 says, Be slow to speak.
[time=2625] Be slow to hear.
[time=2630] Be slow to wrath and quick to hear.
[time=2635] A man by the name of Stephen Covey has written an excellent book titled, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
[time=2642] In it he tells a story that I'll try to paraphrase today.
[time=2646] A man got on a subway on a quiet Sunday morning working his way through New York City.
[time=2652] A few stops later, a man and three children got on the subway.
[time=2656] The man sat down to him and positioned himself almost motionless.
[time=2661] Never said a word.
[time=2663] The three kids were just the opposite.
[time=2665] They zipped from one end of that subway car to the other.
[time=2667] They had trampled on toes, kicked purses, and had gone so far as to grab the newspaper out of other people's hands.
[time=2674] They were terrors.
[time=2676] The man took it for an extended period of time and then finally couldn't handle it anymore.
[time=2682] He elbowed the man next to him and said, You know your kids are really quite obnoxious, and it would be very kind if you would do something about it.
[time=2691] The man lifted his head and began to apologize immediately.
[time=2694] He said, Oh, I'm sorry.
[time=2696] I guess I'm in a days.
[time=2698] I didn't see how bad they were being.
[time=2701] Forgive me. My wife has been battling cancer for the last six months and she just died this morning.
[time=2709] I don't know how to take it, and I guess the kids don't either.
[time=2715] I have often judged another out of ignorance.
[time=2720] I've too often criticized a friend too quickly.
[time=2725] I've spoken to a co-worker too rationally.
[time=2729] I've corrected my children too severely.
[time=2733] I've promised to help too impetuously, and I've declined to aid too impulsively.
[time=2741] I've acted in self-defense or defensiveness too suddenly.
[time=2746] Wise people watch their words.
[time=2752] Someone has drawn a good analogy between the parent and the owl.
[time=2757] He never stops talking, but he doesn't know a word that he's just said.
[time=2761] The old owl lives in the oak tree.
[time=2763] The more he knew, the less he spoke.
[time=2766] The less he spoke, the more he knew.
[time=2770] Wise people watch their words.
[time=2774] The second lesson I would like to learn from Peter is this one.
[time=2777] Christ is always in the business of reshaping our character.
[time=2784] We didn't look at this earlier, but on the first day that Peter meets Christ, his name isn't Peter.
[time=2790] His name is Simon.
[time=2792] Simon's a good name.
[time=2794] It's the New Testament equivalent of the Old Testament, Simeon.
[time=2798] Simeon was an impulsive, impetuous, quick-tum, and fast-tempered man.
[time=2805] And Simon is well-named because he is the same.
[time=2811] Simon is introduced to the Lord Jesus by his brother Andrew, and on their first occasion, Jesus greets him and says, "Simon, I'll call you Cephas," or Peter, which means rock.
[time=2824] Simon was anything but that.
[time=2826] One day he was up, and the next day he was down.
[time=2830] He was a flagmatic.
[time=2832] You never knew what he was going to do.
[time=2834] Well, you knew he was going to talk, but you didn't know whether it was going to be good news or bad news.
[time=2837] You just knew it was going to be extreme news.
[time=2840] If anyone vacillated, if anyone had the ups and downs in life, it was Peter.
[time=2846] Calling him a rock was like calling me two tall hawks or something like that.
[time=2852] It was something that he was not.
[time=2856] And Jesus looks at him and says, "I'm going to call you Rocky Johnson, Rocky, son of John."
[time=2865] And that began to plan a seed in his head.
[time=2869] Yeah, I'm dependable.
[time=2871] I'm solid.
[time=2873] And when Peter blurted out, "You're the Christ, the son of the living God." Jesus went on not only to commend him, but to say, "Thou art Peter."
[time=2883] And upon rock-like men, such as you, I'll build my church.
[time=2888] And again, he would set his shoulders back and cock his chin for approval.
[time=2893] He was the rock.
[time=2895] But in reality, Peter really wasn't much of a rock.
[time=2898] Until Christ began to reshape his character from a flagmatic who was uncertain and undependable
[time=2906] to somebody who was steadfast and unmovable.
[time=2911] That's what God wants to do with each of our lives.
[time=2914] He wants to take us good points and bad points.
[time=2917] And like a sculptor, he wants to chisel on us.
[time=2921] He wants to chisel so that our good qualities can come out and so that our bad qualities can be knocked off.
[time=2929] He wants to sculpt our lives.
[time=2931] The problem with this is God's chiseling is often painful.
[time=2938] It's a good thing that rocks don't have feelings because not one of them would say, "Hey, sculpt me." Could you imagine being Mount Rushmore if it had feelings?
[time=2948] We're just going to drill a hole here in your side with a sledgehammer and a chisel and a pneumatic gun, and then we're going to stick dynamite in.
[time=2954] We're going to blow this out and see if we can't make a nose here.
[time=2959] You know, God says that's what He wants to do with your life.
[time=2962] It's what He wants to do to me.
[time=2964] He wants to put us in the crucible of life and then bring the pummel down and He wants to begin to grind us so that when He pulverizes us through the hard times of life,
[time=2974] He can separate out the real stuff from the impurities and throw one away and keep the other.
[time=2982] We prefer it to be like McDonald's, fast food, fast delivery, have it now.
[time=2988] We prefer it to be like Burger King.
[time=2991] We want Jesus to do it like we would do it if we were doing it, but He's doing it, and He'll do it His way.
[time=2998] And He usually does it through the hard times of life.
[time=3004] There was a sculptor in the city of Florence where all the great sculptors of the Middle Ages
[time=3011] came from.
[time=3012] His last name was Day Antonio.
[time=3015] He had found an exquisite, sizable piece of marble, one that, to the first glance,
[time=3021] would be perfect for sculpting.
[time=3024] He had it hold back to a studio, and it seemed that whenever he wanted to chisel off a delicate little piece, a big hunk would come out.
[time=3034] And whenever he would try to break off a big section, it would just crumble.
[time=3039] It seemed to be an unworkable piece of marble.
[time=3043] He pushed it aside, never to use it again.
[time=3048] Others came along and worked with the same piece of marble to similar effect.
[time=3055] It was then hauled to the city rubbish sheep, and it laid there for 40 years.
[time=3063] One day another man was walking through the town of Florence, another sculptor.
[time=3068] And he noticed the marble and saw its potential.
[time=3072] He had it hauled back to his studio with a hammer and a chisel and a piece of discarded marble,
[time=3079] Michelangelo chiseled out his greatest work, the statue of David.
[time=3086] God has the ability to take your life when somebody would say, "I can't work with him.
[time=3093] I can't tolerate her.
[time=3095] I can't put up with that person another moment." He can take your life and sculpt it and reshape it.
[time=3103] God can take your life out of the rubbish heap, and he can take you from prostitution.
[time=3111] He can take you from drugs.
[time=3113] He can take you out of apathy and indifference.
[time=3116] He can take you out of a broken family and make you the cleavers.
[time=3121] He can chisel you and sculpt you if you'll let him.
[time=3126] The third and final lesson I would like to draw out of this one is this.
[time=3133] Jesus never fails.
[time=3139] When Peter was up, Christ was right there.
[time=3146] When Peter said, "I'm going to take over the world," Christ was right there.
[time=3149] When Peter said, "I never knew you," Christ was right there.
[time=3154] He never once failed Peter, even though Peter failed him repeatedly.
[time=3163] Jesus never fails.
[time=3167] I'd like to risk what you may think is a bit heretical.
[time=3171] Bear with me, please.
[time=3173] I'd like to suggest to you two things at this juncture.
[time=3177] One is, just because you say you're Christian and you say Jesus is Lord,
[time=3183] doesn't mean that any of that is real.
[time=3185] It can be all just words spoken out of an impetuous mouth.
[time=3191] Conversely, just because you, out of fear, are anguished, deny Christ on occasion,
[time=3198] doesn't mean that you really don't belong to him.
[time=3203] You see, Peter illustrates for us that even the best of us can fail miserably.
[time=3210] Never once did Christ cast a shadow over the sincerity of Peter's faith.
[time=3216] Even when three times in the night the coward denied Christ, Christ never denied him.
[time=3225] In 2 Timothy, chapter 2 it says, "That when we are faithless, he is faithful."
[time=3234] And the Old Testament uses a graphic phrase to describe those of us who have regressed spiritually.
[time=3241] It is called backsliding.
[time=3243] Now, you may have heard that term thrown around in churches, but allow me to paint the historical setting for you.
[time=3250] A glorious term, it is not.
[time=3252] Amos uses it, he speaks of Israel as a backslidden heifer.
[time=3257] I, for one, am a city slicker.
[time=3259] It is only through academics that I know that a heifer is a cow.
[time=3264] What Amos is picturing is this cow.
[time=3267] Have you ever seen a cow walk?
[time=3269] There isn't anything pretty about it.
[time=3272] It's a cow working its way up a hill.
[time=3276] 800 pounds thrown this way, 800 pounds thrown that way.
[time=3280] It's more of a wattle than it is a climb.
[time=3284] Any pictures of this cow climbing up a hill halfway, maybe three-fourths of the way,
[time=3290] and it hits a muddy section, and all four legs sprawl out.
[time=3296] It's utterly disgusting.
[time=3298] And the cow slides back down the hill.
[time=3303] Pretty picture, isn't it?
[time=3305] That's what we're like.
[time=3308] Even the best of us who have made spiritual progress are utterly disgusting because we all regress on occasion.
[time=3316] And through our ups and our downs, through our advances and our backsliding, Jesus never fails.
[time=3325] He is always there.
[time=3327] He never moves.
[time=3330] This couple were not getting along the best in their marriage.
[time=3334] She leaned against the passenger door of the car and said to him, "You know, I remember when we were dating.
[time=3341] Even when we were first married, we used to ride in this very car and we'd sit so close to each other and you'd drive with one hand on the wheel and one arm around me and we were inseparable." Those were the good old days.
[time=3355] He looked over her and said, "I'm still driving from the same point in this car."
[time=3361] Guess who moved?
[time=3365] You know, if you look back in your likeness, I remember when my faith in Christ was sharper and crisper.
[time=3371] I remember when I felt so close to God that we were inseparable.
[time=3376] If that's not the way it is today, guess who moved.
[time=3382] Guess who needs to move back.
[time=3387] I think from the life of Peter, there are three lessons here that I want to learn at his expense because I see how hard they were on him.
[time=3396] Lesson number one is this one.
[time=3399] Wise people weigh their words.
[time=3405] The second lesson I want to learn is even in the tough times to hang in there
[time=3411] because God may be trying to reshape my character.
[time=3414] He may be trying to teach me to use my tongue a little more graciously to control my temper a little more certainly.
[time=3422] He's still chiseling and he'll be chiseling till the day I die.
[time=3427] And the third lesson I want to learn is when I fail, is to remember that Jesus never fails.
[time=3435] Our God and Father, we thank you today for the Lord Jesus Christ that he takes assignment and he changes us into a Peter.
[time=3444] We thank you that he can take those of us with a foot-shaped mouth and use us somehow, not because of us, but in spite of us.
[time=3455] We pray this morning, Father, that you would be the one who would speak to hearts.
[time=3460] There would be those today here in this auditorium, or maybe friends who had watched our way of television would give their heart to Christ.
[time=3471] There would be those today who would hear your voice, as Peter did, giving them the insight to discover that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[time=3481] So now in these quiet moments, we ask you to speak to us.
[time=3486] God, we ask you to speak to the hearts of believers, those who may have refused your hammer and chisel,
[time=3496] those who have felt the pain of your blows, and have begun to slide backwards.
[time=3504] We ask you to call them home.
[time=3507] Father, we're all filled with anxiety. We understand Peter.
[time=3511] We'd find it very hard in our office to say, "Yesterday I went to church." We'd find it very difficult to tell our friends that I accept the voice.
[time=3523] We've been sharing with you this morning the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir and soloist, Starr Brodygum and Brian Losen.
[time=3531] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3534] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3539] Just before we close, I'd like to take this moment and pray with you.
[time=3543] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3551] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3554] I ask you to come in today and forgive me and be my Savior.
[time=3559] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3563] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3567] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3575] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the study booklet entitled "How in the World Is It Going to End," please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3590] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1416 or use the sermon title "The Man with the Foot-shaped Mouth" and please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3609] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3617] Perhaps you have thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3621] Why not do it today?
[time=3623] I know it would be an encouragement to pass to Rick and the entire Bible hour staff.
[time=3627] To correspond with us, simply write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3639] Now speaking for Pastor Rick Hawks, this is Paul Branks, inviting you to join us each week at this time for the Bible hour.
[time=3661] [SILENCE - 1854 seconds]
