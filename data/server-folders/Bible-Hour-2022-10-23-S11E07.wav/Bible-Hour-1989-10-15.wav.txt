[time=0] (mysterious music)
[time=60] - There are several things that can keep you out of Heaven.
[time=65] To your surprise, one of them may be
[time=90] "Religion." (mysterious music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=106] Thank you for joining us.
[time=108] Rick's message today is entitled, "Church Leader, Whose Religion Left Him Lacking Something." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=116] Rick's text is taken from the book of John, chapter two, verse 23 through chapter three, verse 16.
[time=123] We are privileged to have a very special musical guest to join with our choir and orchestra today.
[time=129] Let's join our worship service as Peter Kobe introduces this special guest.
[time=133] - Been just about a year now that we have been fellowshipping in this worship center.
[time=140] And on October 15th, I believe it was, last year we dedicated this building.
[time=147] One of the special events was a song by our choir and orchestra entitled, "The Lord Rains." A song was written by Bruce Greer, who resides in Dallas, Texas.
[time=157] We had a very good time talking on the telephone, discussing the text, the type of music style that we wanted for that day.
[time=164] And we finally decided on this particular piece.
[time=168] Not only are we going to repeat that song again, but we are delighted to have with us today, Mr. Bruce Greer from Dallas, Texas.
[time=174] Please, on my right, would you welcome him to Black Hawk today?
[time=177] (audience applauds) These young guys, they really have the talent.
[time=187] It's amazing.
[time=188] There are so many young men that have just, God has given them an unbelievable ability in music, and I'm really thankful for that.
[time=197] Thankful that we have the opportunity to sing and play some of Bruce's music today.
[time=202] The choir's going to sing now that great song, "The Lord Rains." ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer)
[time=234] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=319] ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer)
[time=379] [MUSIC - 56 seconds]
[time=439] ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer) (audience applauds)
[time=455] - Thank you, Bruce, for that wonderful number.
[time=461] We're continuing to praise the Lord, the Almighty as we sing together, Him number eight.
[time=466] Him number eight, we'll sing the first, second, and fourth, stanzas together.
[time=470] ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer)
[time=476] [MUSIC - 15 seconds]
[time=493] (audience applauds)
[time=523] ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer)
[time=583] ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer) - Thank you very much.
[time=598] We continue in music now as we feature Bruce Greer at the piano accompanied by the choir and orchestra with his arrangement, Easter Song.
[time=613] ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer)
[time=793] ("The Lord Rains" by Bruce Greer) (audience applauds) - We wanna thank you for being a part of our Bible, our family, today.
[time=809] We hope that the first part of our service has already been an encouragement to you.
[time=814] It has been to me, particularly the song "The Lord Rains." - Well, Rick, that's become a very favorite piece of our choir, and we always enjoy the fact that you want it sung again, and they always enjoy singing it.
[time=825] - Well, there are a few songs, and that is one of them that I could probably hear every week and just be thrilled with hearing it again and again and again.
[time=833] - So many of the songs are really perfect text for music, and that's one of them.
[time=838] - Well, I hope that we won't wait a whole year till we hear that song again.
[time=842] - We'll try to note to put it in the schedule a few months from now.
[time=845] - Great, I'd love it.
[time=846] We have a special guest coming in just a few weeks for a Friday night concert with our new organ.
[time=852] - Rick, we have a beautiful new organ, and we're happy to announce that Diane Bisch from Fort Lauderdale, Florida is going to come and be with us.
[time=859] She's probably one of the world's greatest organists.
[time=861] She's on television regularly with her own program, and she'll be coming here, and we'd like to invite all of you that are watching to come on November 10th.
[time=870] That's a Friday evening at 7 p.m. to the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=874] Tickets are on sale now at Local Christian Bookstores, and right here at Blackhawk at $4 apiece.
[time=880] That's November 10th at 7 p.m.
[time=883] for a concert by Diane Bisch.
[time=885] - I'll venture to guests that many of you friends who join us here in Fort Wayne at 7 in the morning for the Bible Hour, a little later in the day, tune in to Dr. James Kennedy and his worship service from the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, and that's where she plays and calls home.
[time=903] - She plays, they have a gorgeous pipe organ there, and she plays there every Sunday and just does a beautiful job.
[time=909] - Well, if you've been enjoying her by way of Dr. Kennedy's program, you'll certainly enjoy her in person when she comes here on November the 9th.
[time=916] Well, that's gonna be a big weekend for us here at Blackhawk, and particularly for you, because November the 10th or 11th, one of those dates is the Living Christmas Tree tickets.
[time=926] - On Saturday, November 11th.
[time=929] We will be distributing, that'll be the public distribution for all tickets, and if you would like to come to the Living Christmas Tree this year, just come from nine o'clock to five p.m.
[time=939] at the worship center on the south side of State Street, and you can receive up to eight tickets per person that comes that day for Living Christmas Tree performances.
[time=950] - Well, I'm looking forward to the Living Christmas Tree, and we hope that all of you will come and pick up those tickets.
[time=956] We wish that we could make it a little easier for you, but it's impossible for us to handle telephone orders.
[time=963] Our telephone rings like crazy, and we just don't have the volunteer staff that can be here when the phone rings to handle those ticket orders.
[time=971] So we ask you to come and pick them up in person.
[time=974] We can't handle orders by way of the mail either, because you send us your request, and by the time it gets here through the mail, we have to write back you and say, oh, that concert's gone, but there are some for these two concerts.
[time=985] You write back, and then by that time, there aren't tickets left for anything, and everybody's disappointed.
[time=991] So if you'll come on that Saturday, we'll have tickets.
[time=995] - There'll be available for everyone that comes.
[time=997] - Great.
[time=998] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, I want to offer to you again a booklet that we've put together here at Blackhawk titled, "How in the World Is It Going to End?" As we read the Bible, it talks about the end times.
[time=1012] It talks about Jesus coming back.
[time=1014] It talks about Him rescuing and rapturing believers.
[time=1018] That means He's going to mysteriously at a moment's notice, take all true Christians to heaven with Him.
[time=1025] Those are exciting events, and the Bible gives them definitive insight as to what they'll be like.
[time=1031] We've put together a four-part Bible study under the title, "How in the World Is It Going to End?" And we would be glad to send you a copy.
[time=1040] There is no charge, we'll send it to you as a gift.
[time=1043] We hope you'll write and ask for it today.
[time=1046] Please write for this study guide to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1052] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1056] Once again, that's the Bible hour.
[time=1058] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1063] - Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible hour.
[time=1075] We have the opportunity now to join with both of our pianos and pianists in a number that Bruce arranged specifically for the orchestra and two pianos so that we could have our own Scott Schindler play with Bruce.
[time=1088] We do really appreciate the ministry of Scott and how much he works in our music department.
[time=1092] They'll be playing and featured in this particular piece entitled "Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee."
[time=1106] (gentle music)
[time=1349] (applause)
[time=1357] Thank you to our choir and orchestra, particularly to Scott and to Bruce for that great song and for Pete for all of his work directing this great morning of praise.
[time=1367] We're gonna give you a moment to stand and greet those around you.
[time=1370] We'd like you to make room for the choirs they come in, give a chance for the orchestra to leave, but most of all, a chance for you to find out who that excellent sounding voice was right behind you.
[time=1380] Would you stand and do that right now?
[time=1383] (applause)
[time=1408] Thank you, and you may be seated.
[time=1411] I invite you now to bow that we might pray together.
[time=1414] God, we are grateful this morning that our own hearts can be so filled
[time=1420] as we lift up our voices and praise to you.
[time=1423] We want to sing along as we heard the pianos in orchestra play, joyful, joyful, we adore thee.
[time=1430] God, we love you.
[time=1432] This past week has not reflected.
[time=1434] That is as strongly as it should have.
[time=1437] And I ask you to forgive me.
[time=1440] I want my life to be consistent.
[time=1442] I know that's the prayer of each believer here today.
[time=1445] We want not only to have you at the focal point of our mind during a great majestic anthem.
[time=1452] We want you to have the focal point of our mind in the harsh conflicts in the office and the words we exchange in our homes.
[time=1461] And so we begin today in praying by seeking your forgiveness for our failures and our inconsistency.
[time=1472] We ask you to accept our worship not because of us, but in spite of us.
[time=1478] God, we ask you today to take these gifts of our lips, these words of praise, these thoughts that we have held, the devotion that we cling to, making an acceptable offering to you.
[time=1493] We want to thank you that you are so marvelous, that you are beyond our expectation, so loving that you intimately care about us.
[time=1502] As we study your word today, we want it to be more than a message, more than an hour of academics.
[time=1508] We want it to be a time of insight.
[time=1511] So we ask you to give your word power, power to change our lives.
[time=1518] We ask you to give it power to convict us of sins that we've kept a secret from everyone, maybe even from ourselves.
[time=1527] We ask you to give your word power that might encourage us through the hard times of rejection and disappointment.
[time=1535] We ask you to bring comfort to those who are walking through the hard valleys, for the stewards and the martyrs in the loss of their loved ones, for Kimmy Schlen as she faces surgery, for little Brandon, Greg, and Amy, as they battle for their health.
[time=1554] For parents who have walked through the valleys of fear over their children, we ask you to supplement them with hope.
[time=1562] Now we invite you to do surgery on our heart.
[time=1566] Help us to look deeper than the surface so that we might not only know you, but know ourselves as you know us.
[time=1573] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1578] Have you ever gone to church and come home lacking something?
[time=1583] Have you ever gone to church and said, "I'm not sure if I had to go back next Sunday." (buzzer) I'll probably don't start.
[time=1593] Why do we have to go to church anyway?
[time=1596] We're old enough to make our own choice.
[time=1598] Forget it, Lisa.
[time=1599] You'll never get out of going.
[time=1601] Dad's a deacon.
[time=1602] Big whoop.
[time=1603] Come on, not going.
[time=1605] Come on, Lisa, hurry up.
[time=1607] Your father's in the car and he is getting upset.
[time=1610] (buzzer) I'm not going to church today.
[time=1614] Well, excuse me, young lady, but just what exactly does that mean?
[time=1617] I'm 16, church is boring, and I'm staying home.
[time=1621] Oh, Lisa, church isn't boring.
[time=1623] Last Sunday, Pastor Hawks gave a message.
[time=1626] He compared the burial rites of the early Christians with those of the Hittites, 14 centuries earlier.
[time=1633] Now, that just proves, young lady, if you pay attention, you'll learn something.
[time=1638] Thank you.
[time=1639] You have proven my point.
[time=1641] Church is boring.
[time=1643] The morning service is what needs to be buried.
[time=1646] Can I please stay home?
[time=1649] Look at my hair.
[time=1651] No, your father is in the car and he is upset.
[time=1655] Just hurry, please.
[time=1657] (buzzer) Why do I have to go?
[time=1660] Because we always go to church, Lisa.
[time=1663] We go as a family.
[time=1664] You know that.
[time=1665] You know what they say.
[time=1666] The family that prays together stays together.
[time=1669] (buzzer) One more minute and I'm leaving with you or without you.
[time=1673] So much for the family staying together, ma'am.
[time=1676] (audience laughing) What is the holdup?
[time=1685] Dad, Lisa says she's 16, doesn't want to go to church anymore.
[time=1690] Carl, Lisa says she's not going to church anymore.
[time=1695] Hold it down, hold it down.
[time=1696] It's about my hair.
[time=1697] Sorry, it's just that Dad, I don't want to go to church anymore.
[time=1702] Lisa, we went through this last Sunday.
[time=1704] I told you then, and I'm telling you now, our family always goes to church.
[time=1711] Listen, what are the people going to make?
[time=1715] The pastor's wife, you know her.
[time=1718] She sits right in the choir loft every Sunday just to take attendance.
[time=1722] And after the last day, men, she's going to make a beeline for me and wonder where you were.
[time=1728] (audience laughing) Come on, Lisa, we're already late.
[time=1734] Rachel's dead as a deacon and she skips out all the time.
[time=1738] Why do I have to go?
[time=1740] Because I said so.
[time=1743] Come on, Dad, love it with me.
[time=1745] Why is it such a big deal that I go to church anyway?
[time=1750] Agnes, give your daughter an answer.
[time=1753] Well, because we need to see your grandparents, and that's one of the reasons.
[time=1759] Now, there's a reason to go to church if I ever heard one.
[time=1762] If we're not there, you know they'll miss you.
[time=1767] Okay, it's settled. Let's get going.
[time=1770] Let's get in the car and let's get to church.
[time=1772] But why, Dad?
[time=1774] Because, just because.
[time=1779] Have you ever gone to church and wondered when you got home?
[time=1783] Why do I really go?
[time=1785] What's it all about?
[time=1787] Have you ever gone to church and come home and you found something to be lacking?
[time=1791] Bill Heibels, before he started the now famous Willow Creek Community Church, surveyed thousands of homes and asked the question why people didn't go to church.
[time=1801] At the top of their reasons were these two.
[time=1804] One, it is boring.
[time=1807] I know what they're going to say because I went last year and they say the same thing every time.
[time=1814] The second reason, it's not relevant.
[time=1817] It has absolutely nothing to do with my life.
[time=1821] And maybe you find church boring.
[time=1824] If that's true, I have a booklet that I'd like to recommend to you.
[time=1829] It's titled "101 Things to Do During Adult Sermon." There are some excellent, excellent ideas here.
[time=1838] For example, you can take that Old Testament name Methuselah and see how many words you can make out of it.
[time=1846] One to nine words, some boring spots in the sermon, ten to twenty, lots of boring spots in the sermon.
[time=1854] Twenty-one to forty words, totally boring sermon.
[time=1858] Forty-one or more words, even the minister is bored and has decided to help you.
[time=1865] Here's another one that I think I might like, assuming somebody else was speaking.
[time=1872] It's called play by play.
[time=1875] Seek yourself in the back of the auditorium away from other people.
[time=1880] Here in our church, those are the prime seats.
[time=1882] Quietly broadcast the sermon using the jargon of a sports announcer.
[time=1888] There's a sharp blow to the congregation's conscience.
[time=1891] Oh, another hard hit.
[time=1892] The preacher's a wild man.
[time=1894] He's out there.
[time=1895] He's turning away.
[time=1896] He's shadow boxing now.
[time=1897] Throwing punches at the opponent who isn't really there.
[time=1900] He'd have those liberals up against the ropes.
[time=1902] If they had stepped inside this ring today, look at that fancy footwork.
[time=1906] He's sidestepping an embarrassing question.
[time=1909] There's the bell.
[time=1910] Hey, it's over.
[time=1912] What do you do when church gets a little boring?
[time=1915] But maybe the issue is a little bit more serious than that.
[time=1919] Maybe it's not just a matter of churches being boring.
[time=1922] Maybe you go to church.
[time=1925] Don't know what you expect to get out of it, but you know when you get home.
[time=1929] You didn't get it.
[time=1931] Maybe you go to church faithfully, but you don't know why.
[time=1935] And you've gone through all the reasons, not only with your teenagers, but with yourself.
[time=1940] Reasons like because I said so.
[time=1943] Reasons like because our family always does.
[time=1947] Reasons like you'll get to see your grandparents.
[time=1950] Maybe your best reason is because.
[time=1953] Just because.
[time=1957] Maybe the question is so serious, you don't know whether your religion is real.
[time=1963] And whether your faith is factual.
[time=1966] Or maybe you know that you're doing everything the church wants you to do.
[time=1970] But you're not sure you're doing what God wants you to do.
[time=1974] I believe those are the questions that went through the mind of a man by the name of Nicodemus.
[time=1980] And if you have a Bible, I invite you to find the gospel according to John.
[time=1985] The New Testament reads Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[time=1990] John chapter 2 verse 23 is where I'd like to start reading for you this morning.
[time=1996] John 2 verse 23.
[time=2000] Now, while he, Jesus, was in Jerusalem, at the Passover feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing.
[time=2010] And believed in his name.
[time=2014] But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.
[time=2022] He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.
[time=2029] Now, there was a certain man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.
[time=2037] He came to Jesus at night and said, Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God.
[time=2048] For no one could perform their miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.
[time=2055] In reply, Jesus declared, I tell you the truth.
[time=2061] No one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.
[time=2069] How can a man be born when he is old?
[time=2072] Nicodemus asked.
[time=2074] Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born.
[time=2083] Jesus answered, I tell you the truth.
[time=2088] No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the spirit.
[time=2096] The flesh gives birth to flesh, but the spirit gives birth to spirit.
[time=2102] You should not be surprised at my saying, you must be born again.
[time=2108] The wind blows wherever it pleases.
[time=2111] You hear it sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going.
[time=2117] So it is with everyone who is born of the spirit.
[time=2123] How can this be?
[time=2126] Nicodemus asked, you are Israel's teacher, said Jesus, and do not understand these things.
[time=2134] I tell you the truth.
[time=2136] We speak of what we know, and we testify to that what we have seen.
[time=2144] But you, but still you, people do not accept my testimony.
[time=2150] I have spoken to you of earthly things, and you do not believe.
[time=2155] How then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
[time=2160] No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven, the son of man.
[time=2167] Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the son of man must be lifted up,
[time=2173] that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.
[time=2179] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him
[time=2188] shall not perish but have eternal life.
[time=2193] I believe Nicodemus was a church leader whose religion left him lacking something.
[time=2203] Let me give you a background profile on Nicodemus before we get into the main event, his dialogue with Christ.
[time=2212] We know at least these four things about Nicodemus.
[time=2215] First of all, he was a Pharisee, verse 1 of chapter 3.
[time=2220] Now there was a man of the Pharisees.
[time=2223] If you've been exposed to the New Testament, you've heard much about the Pharisees, most of it bad.
[time=2230] But perhaps they're getting a bum wrap.
[time=2233] The Pharisees were spiritually and politically someone that I could very naturally align myself with.
[time=2241] They came about in a period of time called the Maccabean Revolution.
[time=2246] It was a time of great nationalism against the outsiders, the Greeks, the Samaritans, the Egyptians to the south.
[time=2256] Everyone had overrun their land, but now under the Hasmoneans and the Maccabean, the nation of Israel said it's enough.
[time=2262] We'll fight back.
[time=2264] They were successful.
[time=2266] Nationalism was an all-time high, but this great reform was rather empty spiritually.
[time=2272] It was more social, primarily political.
[time=2276] Little of it was spiritual.
[time=2278] And a group of men studied the Scriptures and began to separate themselves out.
[time=2286] They wanted to live a good life, one that would please God.
[time=2291] So they separated themselves out and became known as the Pharisees.
[time=2296] But over a few hundred years of their existence, they not only taught God's law, but they taught their interpretation of God's law as though it was God's law.
[time=2305] And it literally began then teaching an interpretation of their interpretation of what they believed God's law had to say.
[time=2315] They became self-serving, and they lost their spiritual edge.
[time=2321] Yet they were conservative moderates in a world that was going to extremes.
[time=2326] They were in the middle between the Sadducees and the zealots and the Essenes.
[time=2333] The Sadducees were the religious and political liberals of their day.
[time=2338] The Sadducees did not believe in life after death.
[time=2341] They did not believe in any kind of resurrection.
[time=2344] They did not believe in the import and the inspiration of the Scriptures.
[time=2348] They did not believe in supernatural beings like Satan, demons, or angels.
[time=2352] In fact, I haven't found yet anything that they do believe in.
[time=2356] Yet they were religious spiritual leaders of their day, and they had the majority party.
[time=2362] At the other extreme were two groups, the zealots who were militant and physical,
[time=2368] and they literally hid daggers under their coats so that they could personally do in any Romans whenever they had a chance.
[time=2376] Just as conservative, but opposite and temperament were a group called Essenes.
[time=2381] They were monastic.
[time=2383] They said, "We'll never make any difference.
[time=2385] Let's just withdraw from society." And they went into the caves and into the deserts and set up little utopian cults.
[time=2393] The Pharisees were the conservatives who were trying to have an impact on their society.
[time=2399] And overall, they were probably the best of all of these groups.
[time=2403] And Nicodemus was one of them.
[time=2406] From that we can certainly deduce that he was moral, that he was self-righteous, that he had a high, high interest in doing what was right.
[time=2416] The second thing we know about Nicodemus is this.
[time=2419] He was a leader, a ruler, in the Jewish council.
[time=2423] That's a reference to a group of men who were called the Sanhedrin.
[time=2428] They were politically responsible to interface between the people of Israel and the Roman government.
[time=2435] So whenever somebody had a problem with Rome, they might take it to the Sanhedrin who would appeal it to one like Pontius Pilate.
[time=2443] They also had "spiritual responsibilities." They were the formal ones to determine the interpretation of the Old Testament.
[time=2454] They also had a judicial responsibility.
[time=2458] If you had a complaint against somebody else in Jerusalem, you might take it to the gates and there the older men would overhear the whole situation and make a ruling.
[time=2467] If one of the two parties was not satisfied with that, they might appeal it to this domestic supreme court called the Sanhedrin.
[time=2476] Nicodemus was a part of that group that made him rather significant.
[time=2481] He was somebody.
[time=2482] He was an important, influential leader in his community.
[time=2487] Thirdly, we find in verse 10 that he was a teacher.
[time=2492] He was one positioned to answer the questions of the people, but unfortunately he didn't have the answers himself.
[time=2501] He was coming to Jesus trying to get that insight.
[time=2505] He found himself in that tragic pit of trying to teach what he didn't understand and give away what he didn't possess.
[time=2511] A very precarious position at best.
[time=2515] The fourth thing we know about him is that he was a seeker.
[time=2519] He was a searcher.
[time=2521] We're told that he sought out Jesus and that he came to him by night.
[time=2525] Some interpret that adverbial clause by night to mean that he was afraid.
[time=2530] He didn't want to risk being associated with Jesus.
[time=2533] He didn't want the masses to know that he didn't have all the answers.
[time=2536] Or he didn't want those who were more liberal to think he was swinging conservative and following Jesus.
[time=2543] Perhaps that was his motivation.
[time=2545] Perhaps he knew that if he identified himself with Christ that he might be the blunt of some jokes in the office.
[time=2553] He might find that at the family reunion they not only had Rose Turkey, but they had Rose Nicodemus.
[time=2559] He might find himself on the outs with the people he thought were in.
[time=2564] Maybe he did want a secret meeting.
[time=2567] That may be.
[time=2568] It could also be though that he came by night because he wanted a private meeting so that he could do more than just listen.
[time=2576] He wanted to ask questions and Nicodemus comes with a bag full of questions.
[time=2583] He was a searcher.
[time=2586] The main event is a dialogue between Jesus and Nicodemus.
[time=2591] It's rather easy to follow Nicodemus has three questions Jesus gives three answers.
[time=2598] The first question comes up in chapter 3 verses 1 and 2.
[time=2602] Nicodemus comes to Christ in verse 2.
[time=2605] He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God,
[time=2612] for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."
[time=2620] He makes two introductory statements before he gets to his question.
[time=2624] First he calls Jesus a rabbi, a teacher who has come from God.
[time=2631] Every good teacher then and now has their list of credentials.
[time=2637] You know how it is when somebody is introduced to speak in a formal setting.
[time=2641] They read their pedigree or their obituary just a few years early.
[time=2645] They tell you every place they've been, everything they've done, every degree they've earned, and then they tack on a few degrees they didn't earn because that brings them up.
[time=2653] Most of the teachers were like that.
[time=2656] Tucked inside their coat they had a document that said, "I am rabbi, such and such, and here are my credentials.
[time=2664] I've been trained at the school of Gamalia." You were significant based upon what school you came from.
[time=2674] And here is Nicodemus observing Jesus and he says, "Hey, you're not from Dalek Seminary.
[time=2680] You didn't go to Grace Theological Seminary.
[time=2682] This doesn't sound like the stuff we hear coming out of Westminster.
[time=2687] You're teaching.
[time=2689] It comes from God direct.
[time=2692] You haven't gotten bogged down into all these theological debates and multiplicity of rules.
[time=2698] And that's been confirmed, Jesus, by the miraculous signs you do.
[time=2702] I mean, when Rabbi Gamalia speaks, it's a snoozer.
[time=2706] We consider it miraculous if he keeps the crowd awake and you're healing the lame.
[time=2712] You're opening the eyes of the blind.
[time=2714] You're doing miraculous signs that tell us this is God talking.
[time=2722] He draws a breath ready to ask his first question and he never gets it out.
[time=2728] Before he can ask his question, Jesus gives him the answer.
[time=2733] That wasn't that Jesus was rude.
[time=2736] Jesus wanted to provide this searcher, this searcher, one more miracle.
[time=2741] We purposely began reading in chapter 2 when it says that Jesus did not entrust himself to man
[time=2748] because he knew what was in man.
[time=2751] The next phrase says, "There was a man, Nicodemus." And before Nicodemus could ask his question, Jesus begins to answer it and it had to go like a light in his mind saying, "Who is this guy that knows not only how to do miracles
[time=2767] but he knows what I'm thinking before I can get the question out?" Here's the answer.
[time=2773] We can deduce what Nicodemus' question was by looking at Jesus' answer.
[time=2779] As best I can determine, this is the first game of jeopardy in history
[time=2785] where the answer is given and you have to ask the question.
[time=2788] Like, "Who stood on the front of a boat while the British were shooting at him while crossing the Delaware to have his picture painted?" Question, "Who was George Washington?" Now we just use that same logic.
[time=2801] Jesus' answer is found in verse 4.
[time=2804] Verse 3 when he says, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God
[time=2810] unless he is born again." Well, if that's the answer, the question must be something like this.
[time=2818] What must I do to be a part of the kingdom of God?
[time=2823] Because Jesus' answer says, "In order to be a part of the kingdom of God,
[time=2829] you must be born again." That immediately triggers a lot of thoughts in Nicodemus' mind.
[time=2839] Born again?
[time=2842] So he blurts out his second question, "How can a man be born again when he is old?"
[time=2850] Or stating another way Nicodemus says, "Surely he cannot re-enter his mother's womb
[time=2856] a second time to be born." I don't think Nicodemus was giving him a hard time.
[time=2862] I don't think he was snickering under his breath and saying, "Okay, here's an unsolvable question.
[time=2868] I'm making up statistics now, but he may have said, "I'm 37, five, eight and a half, 155 pounds.
[time=2877] How am I going to become little, re-enter my mother's womb and be born again?" I don't think it was hostile. I don't think it was cynical.
[time=2887] I think Nicodemus wanted to know how.
[time=2891] I think he was saying what the rock musicians are saying now.
[time=2895] If I could turn back time, if I could find a way, I would do it different.
[time=2902] I think Nicodemus looked back in his life and he said, "Oh, if I could go back and do it over, I'd gladly do that.
[time=2908] But how do you go back and do it over?" I remember as a high school student, I had committed a false start.
[time=2914] I got back on the blocks and I lost my balance and I fell start a second time.
[time=2919] I was disqualified.
[time=2922] Oh, I remember my coach dropping his head in disappointment.
[time=2926] I remember towels falling out of my teammates' hands.
[time=2929] I remember the Snickers of Firestone High School.
[time=2933] Oh, if I could turn back time.
[time=2935] If I could be born again, I'd do that day different.
[time=2940] If I could turn back time, I'd turn it back to a Thursday.
[time=2944] Prior to a Friday.
[time=2946] A Friday when I was 16 years old and I got in my father's car and I drove through Cowga Falls right on this new bridge.
[time=2953] It was wide and it was smooth and the speed limit was 35.
[time=2957] I was going 52 and this red light came up behind me and I pulled over so he could get around and chase those other guys and he stopped behind me.
[time=2966] Oh, if I could have done anything, I'd had to turn back time.
[time=2969] I'd have done it different, Dad.
[time=2971] I really didn't mean to.
[time=2974] Oh, if I could turn back time.
[time=2976] I pulled back words that I said to Kathy that were devastating and I'd bury him where she'd never hear him.
[time=2983] If I could go back a year, I'd take my son and that time when I promised him I'd take him somewhere and I broke that promise, I wouldn't let anything stop it if I could turn back time.
[time=2995] Nicodemus was like every one of us.
[time=2998] He would have gladly turned back time.
[time=3001] He would have gladly been born again.
[time=3003] He would have wanted to do it all over.
[time=3006] But how?
[time=3008] Jesus, how?
[time=3010] How can you be born again?
[time=3013] Jesus answers that second question in verse 5.
[time=3017] I tell you the truth.
[time=3019] No one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and of the spirit.
[time=3026] Flesh gives birth to flesh, but spirit gives birth to spirit.
[time=3034] You should not be surprised at my saying, "You must be born again." The wind blows where it pleases.
[time=3043] You can hear it sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going.
[time=3048] So it is with everyone born of the spirit.
[time=3053] Nicodemus' question is, "How can I physically do it?"
[time=3059] Jesus' answer is this.
[time=3061] Nicodemus, I'm not talking about a physical birth.
[time=3065] I am talking about a spiritual birth.
[time=3068] I'm talking about a metamorphosis, not of the body, but of the soul, of the inner person.
[time=3075] I'm talking about a changed you at the core of your being.
[time=3081] He illustrates it by pointing out the wind.
[time=3085] The wind is so mysterious.
[time=3087] It is so powerful.
[time=3089] We know it's there, but yet we can't control it.
[time=3093] Even when a huge hurricane is coming towards the east coast with all of our radar,
[time=3100] with all of our tracking technology, we can say we think it may hit Hilton Head, but it doesn't, and it hits Charleston.
[time=3108] We can't control it.
[time=3110] It's a power beyond us.
[time=3112] God says, "My spirit is alive, and it's a power beyond you that you can't control,
[time=3120] but it can give you a new birth." Nicodemus asked them the third and the most obvious question, "How can I have it?
[time=3128] How can this be?" Jesus speaks some words of correction.
[time=3133] He says, " Nicodemus, you're a teacher of Israel, and yet you don't know these things.
[time=3138] You're a Pharisee.
[time=3139] You're on the Sanhedrin.
[time=3141] You teach a class in theology, and yet you don't know these things."
[time=3148] He gives them a principle.
[time=3150] The principle is this.
[time=3151] We normally teach from experience.
[time=3153] In Nicodemus, you've got no experience in this area.
[time=3156] The only one who has experience in the heaven is the Son of God who came from heaven to earth.
[time=3162] He's the only one that's been there.
[time=3165] And then he gives them the plan by believing, by simple, yet profound, by sincere faith in
[time=3176] God.
[time=3177] And he gives them an illustration.
[time=3178] He goes back into the pages of Numbers where poisonous snakes were biting the children of Israel, and they were going to die.
[time=3186] But Moses put a brazen serpent on a pole, held it up, and anyone who would look would
[time=3195] live.
[time=3196] If there wasn't anything magical taking place, this wasn't Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[time=3201] And something came out of that serpent, some rays that had healing power.
[time=3206] That was simply that God said, "If you'll believe in my plan, I will heal you physically."
[time=3215] And Jesus said, "Just as that serpent was lifted up, so shall I, the Son of man, be lifted
[time=3221] up." He was speaking of the crucifixion.
[time=3223] And if anyone would believe, they could be born again.
[time=3231] Tell me to try to pull this together in three very practical applications.
[time=3236] Application number one is this one.
[time=3240] God knows the deepest need of all of our lives.
[time=3245] Nicodemus came, and before he could ever ask a question, Jesus knew the need of his heart.
[time=3252] You made this morning be so burdened by your marriage relationship.
[time=3258] God knows that.
[time=3260] You may be feeling guilty because you haven't been faithful to your spouse.
[time=3265] God knows that.
[time=3267] You may feel so frustrated and you feel like you can't come to God because you have had
[time=3273] some thoughts or maybe some actions that were homosexual.
[time=3277] God already knows that.
[time=3281] You may feel like, "Oh, I could never come to Jesus because I would have to tell him."
[time=3288] He already knows it.
[time=3292] He knew did Nicodemus' need before he ever spoke.
[time=3295] And there hasn't been one person yet that Jesus ever rejected.
[time=3301] Isaiah made this prophecy.
[time=3303] Before we speak, he will listen.
[time=3307] And while we are talking, he will answer.
[time=3311] The second application I would give you is this one.
[time=3315] Religion cannot save anyone.
[time=3318] If anyone could be a part of God's kingdom, if anyone could have a home and having based upon religion, Nicodemus qualifies.
[time=3326] He was a Pharisee.
[time=3327] He was a moderate.
[time=3328] He was a conservative.
[time=3330] He was a teacher.
[time=3331] He was a member of the Sanhedrin.
[time=3332] He was a member of the local do-gooders club.
[time=3335] I mean, he had it all down.
[time=3338] And yet his religion left him lacking something.
[time=3345] Judaism couldn't save Nicodemus and Christianity can't save you.
[time=3350] Christianity cannot save anyone.
[time=3356] Only Jesus Christ can save someone.
[time=3360] Let me give you very quickly three misconceptions about Christianity.
[time=3365] Misconception number one is that if I have become baptized, then that will please God.
[time=3371] Not true.
[time=3372] There's nowhere in the scripture that teaches that baptism will save anybody.
[time=3377] We can push a little button in the world's most powerful garage door opens up part of that wood wall, and there's a baptistry back there.
[time=3384] After we baptize people, we do not have to send in two janitors with heavy-duty spickenspan
[time=3391] to scrub all of the sins out of the tank.
[time=3394] Nobody sins our washed away in baptism.
[time=3397] It can do nothing, it's only an outward expression of an inward faith.
[time=3404] Misconception number two, if I just join the church, then I get a dual membership.
[time=3412] Here at Black Hawk and up in heaven, not true.
[time=3417] Joining this church cannot save anybody.
[time=3420] No church can save anyone.
[time=3424] One is man trying to reach up to God, Christ is God trying to reach down the man.
[time=3429] It's all the difference in the world.
[time=3432] I'm not trying to discourage anybody from joining our church, but don't join if you think it's going to get you in good with God.
[time=3440] Misconception number three is this one.
[time=3442] If I just live by Christian principles, then I'll be a Christian and I'll have a home in heaven.
[time=3448] Not true.
[time=3449] If anybody lived the ethical life, it was Nicodemus, and yet he was the one that had to be born
[time=3455] again.
[time=3456] Now, if you're going to move into my neighborhood, I want you to know I'd much rather you live by Christian principles than Hell's Angels principles.
[time=3464] But don't think just because you do, God's going to have a home for you in heaven.
[time=3471] Jesus made the most simple, yet the most exclusive statement, "You must be born again."
[time=3479] It's been a special privilege today to present music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra.
[time=3499] Our guest musician was Bruce Greer from Dallas, Texas, and the message today was from our own pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3506] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to pray this prayer with you just before we close.
[time=3515] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins, and today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3526] I ask you to forgive me of the sins and be my Savior today.
[time=3530] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3533] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3538] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3547] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the Bible study booklet entitled "How in the World Is It Going to End," please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne,
[time=3558] Indiana, 46815.
[time=3564] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1417 or use the sermon title, "Church Leader, Whose Religion Left Him Lacking Something," and please impose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3582] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3589] Perhaps you have thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3593] Why not do it today?
[time=3594] I know it would be an encouragement to pastor Rick and the entire Bible hour staff to correspond with us simply write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3608] Now speaking for Pastor Rick Pops, this is Ed Richard and I invite you to join us each week at this time for the Bible hour.
