[time=1315] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1322] I'd like to invite you to bow with me as we pray together.
[time=1326] Father, the clapping of our hands reflects the affirmation of our hearts.
[time=1332] We do have faith in you.
[time=1335] As we face the uncrossable, the insurmountable, and the impossible, we believe that you are able, even in those situations, to show that you are the Lord who reigns.
[time=1348] And we would pray today for those whose hearts feel like they are standing on the edge of a river that they cannot afford.
[time=1357] It is too wide.
[time=1359] It is too deep that they will see you as their bridge and their salvation.
[time=1365] We would pray this morning that you would give hope to the hopeless in San Francisco.
[time=1372] We pray that you would take that tragedy, and in many lives use it for triumph.
[time=1379] May there be those who, when they felt the earth shake, discover that there is a power beyond humanity.
[time=1386] There is a God to whom they can turn his refuge.
[time=1390] Father, we would pray today for those who are facing the anxieties of enemies that we all fear.
[time=1398] The words cancer, melanoma, chemotherapy, carcinoma.
[time=1408] God, we ask you in the face of that mountain that seems too big to be tunneled through
[time=1415] to bring that light of hope.
[time=1418] We pray for Sherry Carlson that her body will recover from surgery and will not be a reoccurrence of her cancer.
[time=1426] We pray for little Amy Moore as she battles not only against Burkett's lymphoma, but to fight back to recover from the effects of medicine that you will give strength.
[time=1437] We thank you that Greg Hindle is playing basketball and pray that he will never again have a reoccurrence.
[time=1444] We pray this morning for those who have to face the death of a loved one.
[time=1449] You, as the God of all peace, would keep their hearts and minds.
[time=1453] We pray for Mike Johnson in the loss of his father.
[time=1456] We pray for the Sibitz family in Loretta's death.
[time=1460] We pray for the stewards in the loss of Judy's father.
[time=1463] We pray this morning that you would give peace to those whose anxieties have brought them to discouragement to break down.
[time=1471] We pray for a friend of the hormones Cathy gets, that you would give comfort to her mind.
[time=1477] We pray this morning that you would take our lives and cause us to be bold and gracious, to be daring and to be disciplined for Jesus' sake.
[time=1489] [AMEN] Most of us remember the famous tales of King Arthur's Court, of Sir Gwayne, Lancelot, the beauty of Guinevere, and all of the great tales that come from Camelot.
[time=1504] Not to be outdone by their English counterparts, the French across the English Channel have their list of heroes as well.
[time=1511] Rather than celebrating King Arthur's Court, they celebrate their own, Charles the Great.
[time=1517] We call him Charlemagne.
[time=1519] Charlemagne was crowned emperor of France and of the Roman Empire on Christmas Day in the year 800, and he had 12 of his most trusted knights, 12 men that he could send in the battle, 12 men who were always willing to take a risk.
[time=1536] They weren't called Lancelot or Sir Gwayne, their names were Roland and Oliver and 10 others like them.
[time=1544] They were brave men, men who were known for being champions, men who were willing to take a risk.
[time=1552] The name for these men was Paladin.
[time=1555] You remember that cowboy show from when we were little?
[time=1558] Have gun, will travel, wire Paladin.
[time=1562] The name Paladin means someone who was a champion, someone who was brave, someone who was willing to take a risk.
[time=1572] I believe that Jesus Christ calls each of us to be a Paladin.
[time=1576] Not that we have to strap on our gun, but that we have to be willing to take a risk.
[time=1582] Be like Charlemagne's great adventurers, men and women who can always be counted on, who will always be brave, who will always be daring, men and women who are willing to go out on a limb for Christ.
[time=1598] If you have a Bible, I invite you to turn to Luke chapter 19 where we meet one man who went out on a limb to meet Christ.
[time=1607] His name was Zacchaeus.
[time=1609] Remember the story when you were children Zacchaeus was a wee little man, a wee little man was he?
[time=1614] He climbed up in the sycamore tree for the Lord he wanted to see.
[time=1618] Well certainly literally Zacchaeus climbed up into a tree, but figuratively he also went out on a limb to meet Christ.
[time=1628] If you have a Bible, please follow along with your eyes as I read with my lips.
[time=1633] Luke 19 verse 1, Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
[time=1641] A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus.
[time=1645] He was the chief tax collector and was wealthy.
[time=1649] He wanted to see Jesus, he wanted to see who Jesus was,
[time=1655] but being a short man he could not because of the crowd.
[time=1660] So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore fig tree to see him,
[time=1666] since Jesus was coming that way.
[time=1669] When Jesus reached the spot he looked up and said to him,
[time=1676] "Zacchaeus, come down immediately.
[time=1679] I must stay at your house today." So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
[time=1687] All the people saw this and began to mutter.
[time=1690] He's gone to be the guest of a sinner.
[time=1693] But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, here and now I give half my possessions to the poor,
[time=1702] and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay him back four times the amount."
[time=1711] Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house because this man, too, is a son of Abraham, for the son of man came to seek and to save what was lost."
[time=1727] Well, I would like to borrow the title from a writer by the name of Frank Barber who did a study on the life of Zacchaeus and called him a man who went out on a limb to meet Jesus.
[time=1738] I thought that was a good title and expressed what happened not only literally but figuratively.
[time=1744] Zacchaeus was a man who took a risk to follow Christ.
[time=1748] I would like today to identify the root of Zacchaeus's problem and three limbs on which he went out to meet Christ.
[time=1758] If you have a King James Bible, I'd like to make a point of clarification.
[time=1762] In the King James Bible, it says that Zacchaeus was not a tax collector, but it calls him a publican.
[time=1768] The clarification I want to make is, please note, the word "publican," not the word "republican." Please don't confuse those two.
[time=1778] Zacchaeus was, by occupation, a "publican," which is here called, and rightfully so, a tax collector.
[time=1786] And as a tax collector, he became a very wealthy man, but it was by means of extortion.
[time=1793] None of us like to hear these words.
[time=1796] "Hello, I'm from the IRS, and I'm here to help you." Somehow that seems a counter-diction in terms.
[time=1804] But whatever our feelings may be about the IRS, they are nothing like the feelings these people had for Zacchaeus and his kind.
[time=1814] The tax system was intrinsically corrupt.
[time=1818] The reason it is called a publican is because of how a person gained that position.
[time=1825] Rome would create what they would call tax regions.
[time=1829] It might be something like the state of Indiana, the fourth congressional district, or Allen County.
[time=1836] Then they would put that tax district on auction, and whoever was the highest bidder purchased the rights to be the tax collector, the publican, for that region.
[time=1848] They then took the money, which they did bid, and put it in the public treasury, hence the title publican.
[time=1856] Then Rome would assign how much revenue had to be raised from that region.
[time=1861] The publican would go to that region, and he would literally set up a franchise, like McDonald's, and he would create various points of tax collection.
[time=1871] And he would sell franchises to local tax collectors, who would collect money from the people.
[time=1879] Here's how the system works.
[time=1881] Rome required a certain amount come out of that district.
[time=1885] Let's say that they required a million dollars out of that district.
[time=1889] The publican would then turn around and sell the rights to local tax collectors for, let's say, a million five.
[time=1899] Make his half a million dollars.
[time=1901] Had to pay back what he put in the public treasury in some of his own pockets.
[time=1905] Then the local people, let's say that there were 10 of them who were responsible to collect 150,000 dollars would collect 250,000 dollars and pocket 100,000.
[time=1916] It was quite a system.
[time=1918] There were two basic types of taxes.
[time=1921] The first were called direct taxes.
[time=1923] Any male or female ages 14 to 65 had to pay a head tax for the right to be.
[time=1931] Just your life, so we tax you.
[time=1934] Then in addition to that they had a land tax, which we had called property tax.
[time=1938] Then in addition to that they had a 1% income tax.
[time=1943] But in addition to all of those they had indirect taxes.
[time=1947] A tax collector could set up a booth wherever he wanted to.
[time=1951] So if there was one road like the center aisle that led into a city from a certain direction, tax collector would set up a booth and he'd collect taxes for going into the city.
[time=1960] Then he'd collect taxes for going out of the city.
[time=1962] Then he would collect taxes for stopping and thinking about going in or out of the city.
[time=1967] If there was a bridge, he'd set up a booth and he'd collect the tax for going across the bridge to the east and then tax it for going across the bridge back to the west.
[time=1976] And if you were coming by yourself, you paid a tax.
[time=1979] But if you were having a cart pulled by an oxen or another animal, then you were charged not only for the cart, but depending on how many wheels the cart had.
[time=1988] You thought Allen County originated the wheel tax. Not true.
[time=1993] They had a wheel tax for crossing the bridge. They had a food and beverage tax.
[time=1998] They taxed wine at the production level, then they taxed it at the wholesale level,
[time=2004] then they taxed it at the resale level, and then they taxed you to get out of jail when you were the retailer who took too much.
[time=2010] They literally had a tax for everything, and the tax collectors were making their money by a simple, well-designed plan of extortion.
[time=2021] You just squeezed the people for as much as you could get.
[time=2026] But beyond being a system of extortion, it was also viewed by the people to be a system of treachery and treason.
[time=2035] The Roman tax system was oppressive, and the tax collectors were the oppressors.
[time=2042] And any man like Zacchaeus, who was a Hebrew, and would collect taxes for the Romans was a Benedict Arnold of the first degree.
[time=2051] That was considered treason. That was considered being a traitor to the Father Abraham, the nation of Israel, and the God who ruled the land.
[time=2060] So the people hated them all the more, not only for their extortion, but for their lack of loyalty to their land.
[time=2067] And finally, they were viewed as the most contemptible form of humanity.
[time=2073] In Matthew 9, they are labeled together with sinners when it says tax collectors and sinners.
[time=2080] Later on in Matthew, they are paired up with publicans and harlins.
[time=2085] They are equated to be the dogs that they viewed the Gentiles to be.
[time=2090] And because they were tax collectors, had their association with Rome, it was always viewed that they were ceremoniously unclean.
[time=2098] You would not let them into your house. You would not go into their house.
[time=2102] They were not permitted entrance into the synagogue. They were unclean.
[time=2108] It's hard to overestimate the hatred that the common person, whether rich or poor, had for the tax collector.
[time=2119] Paying taxes has never been fun. However, it will be easier for all of us next year.
[time=2125] The IRS has come out with a brand new form that we'll be able to use next year if you want to use the short form.
[time=2132] The short form has two lines on it. Line number one says, how much did you make last year? Line two says, send it all in.
[time=2140] You won't need an accountant. You won't need to call the IRS. It will be straightforward and simple.
[time=2146] For them, taxes was not a laughing matter. It was a matter of life and death.
[time=2152] They saw the life being squeezed out of their own family and put into the family of the tax collectors.
[time=2158] But the bottom line is this, whether he was a tax collector or not, whether he was a trader or not, Zacchaeus was a man with a need.
[time=2170] And his need, the root of his problem, was he was a sinner who needed a savior.
[time=2177] And he was a man who was willing to go out on a limb to meet Christ.
[time=2183] The Bible tells us that Zacchaeus was a short man and history tells us that he was a contemptible man.
[time=2191] I don't know who you picture when you think of Zacchaeus. I picture Danny DeVito and the character of Louis on Taxi.
[time=2198] You know, some short gruff, detestable little guy.
[time=2202] Before I read all this, I thought he was just this nice, wee little man who climbed up in the tree.
[time=2207] But the more you think about it, he's got to be a lot like Louis, a guy you love to hate.
[time=2212] But he becomes a model for each of us in that he went out on the limb.
[time=2219] Not just the limb of a sycamore fig tree, but he went out on three limbs figuratively, limbs on which God asked each of us to perch our lives.
[time=2230] Here's limb number one.
[time=2232] He went out on the limb of personal resignation.
[time=2237] As a tax collector, Zacchaeus was a man who had made his own choices.
[time=2246] He had to be impervious to the wishes and the whimpering of the masses.
[time=2251] Every one of them had a sob story. Every one of them had a hard luck reason why they shouldn't have to pay so much taxes, but they weren't going to get past him.
[time=2261] He'd get every nickel, every dime, every wage coming to him, and maybe even a little bit more.
[time=2270] He made his own decisions.
[time=2272] He would not allow public opinion or popular pressure to shape who he was.
[time=2278] He was an individual. He was self-determined and self-directed.
[time=2282] He was, in the words of Mark Twain, an example of rugged individualism.
[time=2289] He would not be impressed with what people thought he should be.
[time=2294] He would be unconquerable and undaunted in the face of popular tide.
[time=2300] He, and he alone, was in charge of his life and of his business.
[time=2307] He reminds me of the poem by William Henley called in Wectus, which is Latin for "unconquerable."
[time=2314] Listen, out of the night that covers me, black is the pit from pole to pole.
[time=2321] I thank whatever God's may be for my unconquered soul.
[time=2328] In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winched or cried aloud.
[time=2334] Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody but unbowed.
[time=2340] Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the whore of the shade, and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid.
[time=2352] It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishment to scroll.
[time=2357] I am the master of my fate.
[time=2360] I am the captain of my soul.
[time=2365] Such a man was Arzakias, Ar-Louis of the first century.
[time=2371] He didn't care what anybody else thought about him.
[time=2374] He was in charge of his life and he would call the shots.
[time=2381] Never before had anyone told him what to do.
[time=2386] And then suddenly Jesus comes to his town.
[time=2392] And Jesus says to him, "You come down.
[time=2399] I am going to your house today." Jesus emphasized his instructions with the words immediately.
[time=2409] And Zakias responded immediately.
[time=2413] In the face of Henley's and what-toose are the words of Jesus who said,
[time=2419] "If any man will come after me." He must deny himself.
[time=2425] Zakias said, "Assert yourself." Jesus said, "Deny yourself.
[time=2430] Take up your cross." Zakias said, "Take up your purse." Jesus said, "Follow me." Zakias said, "Bring it to me." The first limb on which he had to perch himself was the limb of personal resignation.
[time=2450] He had to resign his life to the authority of Jesus Christ.
[time=2455] For all of these years, Zakias, throne, had been occupied by self.
[time=2463] Self-drive, self-determination, self-insertiveness, self as captain.
[time=2474] And Jesus said, "Now you must resign.
[time=2478] You must turn over your life to me.
[time=2482] You must surrender." If you want to come to Christ, you must be a paladin.
[time=2491] You must be willing to risk everything and personally surrender to him.
[time=2499] There's a second limb that Zakias went out on, one on which you and I must also climb upon.
[time=2507] It is the limb of public rejection.
[time=2511] Nobody liked Zakias.
[time=2514] The writer Frank Barker from whom I stole the title penned these words.
[time=2520] Zakias had closed his tax office a bit too late to save himself a good spot along the street.
[time=2527] He chided himself for it.
[time=2529] A place in the back row would do no good for a man as short as he.
[time=2534] Now he would either have to miss the parade or find a way to get a look.
[time=2539] For he knew no one would make a place for him.
[time=2542] Make room for the hated tax collector.
[time=2545] He snorted at the thought of someone even suggesting it.
[time=2550] No one ever invited him to join in.
[time=2554] He'd gotten even, of course.
[time=2556] He had found his place among the Roman invaders and repaid his neighbor's rejection
[time=2562] when they pleaded for leniency against the exorbitant taxes.
[time=2568] No wonder on that day when Jesus came to Jericho there was no cozy group of friends
[time=2575] coaxing Nicodemus to share their spot on the parade route.
[time=2580] He was an outsider, a social leper, reviled by the poor because he was rich.
[time=2589] Detested by the rich Jews because of how he got his money.
[time=2593] An ostracized by the Romans because he was a Jew.
[time=2598] He was a man who belonged nowhere into no one.
[time=2603] His bank account held his only value as a person.
[time=2607] Without his money and his position he would have nothing at all.
[time=2615] He was a man who spent most of his life avoiding the crowd.
[time=2619] He wasn't the man who gathered at the local watering hole or met the guys just to talk about the chariot races on the day before.
[time=2628] Nobody included him.
[time=2630] In the invitation to their parties, to their houses, to our local athletic or cultural events.
[time=2637] He was an outsider.
[time=2640] He spent most of his time in the shadows trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.
[time=2647] He probably won as many places as he could in cognito.
[time=2652] And now as the streets were lined with people to see Jesus, he climbs up in a tree, crawls
[time=2659] out on a limb so he can see the teacher from Nazareth.
[time=2664] How conspicuous!
[time=2667] How vulnerable! He was exposed.
[time=2670] Now, instead of being in the shadows, he was in the eyes of everyone and he could hear them talking. Look at Zacchaeus.
[time=2676] Oh, this would be a great day to have a chainsaw. Oh, I just loved him.
[time=2680] You know, watch him come down.
[time=2683] Oh, y'all, if there's any justice in heaven one, just one bolt of lightning, please.
[time=2688] The second more tree.
[time=2690] He was despised and hated.
[time=2694] And yet he went out on a limb where everybody could see him.
[time=2699] vulnerable and exposed the public rejection.
[time=2705] Do you know if you and I are going to be a paladin?
[time=2708] If you and I are going to come to Christ, we have to be willing to go out on a limb, way out on the limb of social rejection.
[time=2717] Some of you have already calculated and you've counted the cost.
[time=2721] And you know that if you give your life to Christ at your high school, they'll talk about you behind your back and they'll call you the Holy Roller or the preacher.
[time=2732] You know that when you get on the bus to travel with the athletic team, suddenly there won't be four guys saying, "Hey, I got a seat for you." They'll all crowd together and look the other way when you come by, letting you know that you don't fit in. You're not one of them.
[time=2747] Some of you know that if you make your commitment to Christ, in your office, you won't fit in anymore.
[time=2757] They know that you don't drink. They don't drink that much themselves.
[time=2760] But now every chance they have, they offer you a beer just to see you squirm.
[time=2769] Some of you know that if you become a paladin, if you take the risk of following Christ wholeheartedly, it'll be your family members who will reject you.
[time=2779] You know it's been a family tradition since as long as you can remember that the family got together and celebrated one of those birthday parties on Saturday nights. It's been that way forever.
[time=2790] And then just recently, you've noticed how certain family members say, "Hey, we're getting together for the birthday party.
[time=2797] We hope you can come. We're going to get together." Sunday late morning, about 11, you know that they are just trying to test you.
[time=2808] They know they're making you choose.
[time=2812] Is your religion all that important? Is this Jesus something that's going to control your life?
[time=2816] Or can we lever you?
[time=2819] They're going to make it purposely hard.
[time=2822] And you're not going to win because if you come to the party, they're going to make a point of saying, "Oh, we pride you away from church, did we today?" And if you don't come, then your religion's terrible because it's dividing the family.
[time=2836] You know that if you come to Christ, you're going to face social rejection.
[time=2840] Some of you know that if you're going to come to Christ when you go home, that boyfriend is going to say to you no more.
[time=2848] Some of you know that your girlfriend's going to unload you the day you pick up Christ.
[time=2854] Some of you have counted the cost.
[time=2858] And if you're going to come to Christ, then you can't continue to share the same address and more with your boyfriend or girlfriend.
[time=2866] You're going to have to make the choices.
[time=2870] Zacchaeus went out on a limb, way out on a limb.
[time=2874] The limb of social rejection.
[time=2878] Jesus forewarned, and we can only echo his words that in this life we should expect tribulation, persecution.
[time=2886] You and I are blessed because there aren't those who are persecuting us with whips or with guns. They are in other parts of the world today, but not here. But yet you and I face what would they think at the school?
[time=2902] What would they say at the office? How would I handle my family if I fully followed Christ?
[time=2910] If you're going to come to him, you've got to be willing to take the risk.
[time=2914] You've got to crawl out on a limb. You've got to be vulnerable.
[time=2918] You'll be a paladin. The third limb on which we must place ourselves is the limb of proper restitution. Verses one through seven constitute a completely different scene than the verses that follow. Verses one through seven take place in the streets of Jericho. In the crowd it is there that Jesus calls Zacchaeus down from the tree and invites himself to dinner. Zacchaeus quickly obliges.
[time=2950] The crowd begins to mutter, not just about Zacchaeus, but about Jesus. Jesus is going to Zacchaeus's house. I mean, doesn't have any sense of cultural norms. I mean, is this Nazarene totally uncouth? Next thing you know, he'll be taking up with other sinners, Gentiles, prostitutes. Who knows where this is going? Then in verse 8 the curtain has dropped. Before it rises again the scene has changed and some moments have passed.
[time=2982] Some words have already been exchanged.
[time=2986] We're now in Zacchaeus's house picking up the end of a conversation between Zacchaeus and Jesus.
[time=2994] Verse 8 Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look Lord, here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor and if I've cheated anybody out of anything I will pay back four times the amount." That's quite a generous recovery. No doubt when Zacchaeus made that charitable
[time=3020] contribution of 50% of all that he possessed, he did fill out the long form that year. But beyond that he said and if I have cheated anybody if I have extorted money from anybody, if I mismanaged the funds of anyone else, I'll not only pay them back I'll pay them back with interest and with two penalties if it was $100 I'll pay back $400. If it was $150 I'll pay back $600 but I'll pay it back.
[time=3052] You know when you come to Christ one of the limbs on which you must go out is the limb of proper restoration. Zacchaeus had counted the cost and he realized that if he were to come to Christ he couldn't come to Christ and not face the issue of his past eyeball the eyeball.
[time=3076] I'd like to boldly yet graciously address some things that I hear floating around Christianity today and even this church. I've heard people make comments like this. Yeah that was bad and I really feel bad about it myself but praise God I accepted Christ last month and all that's in the past 2 Corinthians 5 17 says if any man be in Christ he's a new creature. Old things are passed away, all things are new. That's in my past and I don't have to worry about it not true. When you come to Christ he doesn't take our past and excuse it. He takes our past and expects us to restore it.
[time=3124] We can't say I'm a new man in Christ, old things are passed away I'm no longer responsible. Let me illustrate it in a way in keeping with today's study that I believe you understand.
[time=3136] Dear IRS agent I received your notification that last year I was several thousand dollars behind in my taxes and you would now like to collect those plus interest plus a substantial penalty. I understand your position but I have some good news to share with you. Since last year's filing date I've received Jesus Christ as my savior and I'm now a new man and all my old debts are passed away God bless you, have a nice new year.
[time=3168] You laugh because you know that wouldn't fly with the IRS and I don't think it flies with God either.
[time=3176] Another phrase that I hear kicked around is people saying yeah that happened but praise God it's under the blood now. Some of you who aren't from church background just cringe and said what does he mean under the blood.
[time=3188] The Bible tells us that the wages of sin is death and that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins but the good news is that Christ died his blood was shed so my sins and yours can be forgiven.
[time=3204] Some mistakenly think that since they've accepted Christ his blood has forced away all their sins they don't have to restore the past not true. Christ's death did pay for your sins
[time=3218] spiritually and you are now declared innocent and forgiven before God but the natural consequences of those sins remain. Some of you say no wait a minute you don't understand I just read Dr. Arree's book on the great salvation and it's all by grace you're absolutely right you are saved totally and fully by grace you probably have Ephesians 2 8 9 in mind for by grace are you saved through faith it is the gift of God it is not of works lest any man should boast underline every word of it we're saved by grace just don't stop underlining. The very next work says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for the purpose of doing good works.
[time=3272] When you come to Christ you come to him by grace and now by his grace we go eyeball to eyeball and we face our past and we restore it. Nicodemus went out on a limb the limb of proper restoration to come to Christ. If you're going to be a paladin if you're going to take the risk one of the limbs you must fall out upon is the risk of proper restoration. One of my close friends Greg came to Christ as I did as a high school student Greg always had the sharpest spiritual instincts. It had only been a matter of days since he had come to Christ no one had read him this passage or any like it but by the leading of the spirit Greg said to me you don't have to go in but will you ride over with me to name the pharmacy back in hometown Calgary Falls I said why? He said because I worked for him most of last year and I took things money and products he never knew it and I've got to go back and pay him back. The pharmacist to my knowledge never knew what Greg had done but Greg went and told him about it offered to make restitution the man was shocked not that he had done such a terrible thing but having done it he now came back to make it right it turned into a great opportunity to witness for Christ but if you don't make the restoration the opportunity will never be there. G Campbell Morgan tells the story of a night when four ladies were to give their testimony in an evening service. Three of them gave theirs and did well. The fourth just quietly walked away declining to give hers. Later Dr. G Campbell Morgan asked her why she left
[time=3388] her response was those first three ladies who gave such nice testimonies all owe me money and they're living comfortably. I can't pay my bills and they've never paid me back. There's no power you're not a paladin if you don't make proper restitution. If you want to follow Christ you've got to be willing to go out on a limb make it three limbs. The limb of personal resignation we must resign our lives to Christ. The limb of public rejection we must want to please him not everybody else and the limb of proper restitution allow me to close with the words of this hymn I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold. I'd rather be his than have riches untold. I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
[time=3448] I'd rather be held by his nail pierced hand than to be the king of a vast domain or to be held in sin's dread sway.
[time=3460] I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[time=3468] It's been a privilege today to present to you music from our
[time=3487] sanctuary choir the men singers and soloists Marilyn Wong the message was from our pastor Rick Hawks. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3503] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3519] In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=3523] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision and when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
