[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - Christianity has been falsely called a crutch for the week.
[time=53] That is not true, only a few, only the brave, dare enough to be called.
[time=60] That is not a question.
[time=62] (music playing)
[time=75] - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox, thank you for joining us.
[time=79] Rick's message today is entitled "A Drill Sergeant with an Unusual Disposition." The Roman Citurian was the counterpart of our drill sergeant.
[time=88] It was his assignment not only to drill and discipline his men, but to lead them into battle as well.
[time=93] The centurians were the backbone of the Roman army.
[time=96] They were harsh in demanding, emotionless, and pitiless.
[time=100] It was not in their job description to be compassionate or popular.
[time=104] He was to be feared rather than liked.
[time=106] Of all people, a Roman Citurian came to Christ showing remarkable humility, tenderness, and
[time=112] faith.
[time=113] Study with us today as we learn three strategic lessons from a drill sergeant with an unusual spirit.
[time=119] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Luke chapter 7.
[time=124] Rick's text is taken from verses 1 through 10.
[time=127] Our special music today includes a song from Celebration and a duet from Keith and Star
[time=134] Bratigo.
[time=137] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir along with the children's choirs, bring us a number entitled "Let His Children Rejoice."
[time=149] "Let His Children Rejoice, for He is for the creation, Let His Children Rejoice, and
[time=166] sing us on the salvation.
[time=168] Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial, Let His Children Rejoice,
[time=177] for He is not a pre-emeterial, Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial,
[time=191] Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial, Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a
[time=201] pre-emeterial, Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial, Let His Children
[time=207] Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial, Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeter
[time=224] ial, Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial, Let His Children Rejoice,
[time=233] for He is for the creation, Let His Children Rejoice, and sing us on the salvation.
[time=245] Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial, Let His Children Rejoice, for He is not a pre-emeterial,
[time=703] The reason we lift our voice is more than just making harm our being.
[time=715] The reason we sing is to praise the One who gave His Son to be.
[time=724] The reason we sing.
[time=735] More than just an emotion, His Spirit gives us joy that we can't hide.
[time=743] We will not be silent, we've got to let the world hear what's inside.
[time=751] As we pray, still, with our youth in.
[time=760] Jesus is the One we glorify.
[time=768] The reason we sing, the reason we lift our voice is more than just making harm our being.
[time=782] The reason we sing is to praise the One who gave His Son to be.
[time=793] The reason we sing, the reason we lift our voice,
[time=822] for His Father is not a pre-emeterial,
[time=831] The reason we sing is to praise the One who gave His Son to me.
[time=840] The reason we sing, the reason we lift our voice is more than just making harm our being.
[time=866] Each week we look forward to bringing our morning worship service into your home or your hospital room or wherever you may be, and we want to thank you for joining us today.
[time=876] This is our last opportunity to tell you about two events coming up in the life of our church, a concert with Diane Bish and the distribution of the Living Christmas Tree tickets are just days away.
[time=886] That's right, Rick.
[time=888] Diane Bish is coming to Fort Wayne from Florida.
[time=891] She is an outstanding, in fact, one of the world's greatest organists.
[time=895] So I hope that we're impressing upon you that we have a very fine musician coming to Blackhawk on Friday evening, November 10th.
[time=903] That's at 7 p.m., and tickets are on sale now at local Christian bookstores or here at Blackhawk Baptist Church at $4 a piece.
[time=910] This is going to be a mighty, majestic evening of organ music with Diane Bish.
[time=916] I hope she'll come and join us.
[time=918] You know, Pete, I'm looking forward to that.
[time=920] You know me that I don't have great music or ability, but I so admire the organ because of its versatility.
[time=926] It can be soft and quiet, reflective, but it can be the most powerful, majestic instrument
[time=932] of music as well.
[time=934] And she does a good job of using all of the stops that are on our organ, and we're very pleased with the organ that we have, and I think that that's just going to be a magnificent night.
[time=943] Well, as we built our new building, we were able to purchase a brand new organ, and it has a special effect called an antifonal chamber, and I enjoy that.
[time=951] Well, Rick, we've built a chamber on each side of the choir loft in the front, and then above the balcony in the back there is this antifonal chamber, and it does allow for a very full sound or this echo effect of playing in the front, and then playing in the back,
[time=967] and that is a beautiful effect.
[time=969] Well, that concert's coming up on Friday night, November the 9th, and we'd love to have you come and join us.
[time=976] How can our friends get tickets?
[time=977] They can receive tickets by either stopping here at Blackhawk Baptist Church, Rick, or you can join in stopping in at any of the Christian bookstores in the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=987] And because of the size of our auditorium, you can purchase them that night at the doors.
[time=991] That's right.
[time=993] And then the very next day, that's Saturday, November the 10th, we are beginning to pass out the living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=1000] So all of you friends who I bumped into at the mall or other places, when you've asked Peter myself for tickets, here's how you can get them.
[time=1007] Well, we have ticket distribution on Saturday morning, November 11th, beginning at 9 a.m.
[time=1013] right here in the worship center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church, and we will be here until 5 p.m. in the afternoon.
[time=1019] If you come, each person that walks into the door can receive as many as eight tickets for the concert of your choosing.
[time=1026] So I hope that you'll set that date aside, watch the local newspapers for advertisements concerning the schedule of the days that we'll be giving concerts.
[time=1035] And again, the public distribution is Saturday, November 11th from 9 to 5 at the Blackhawk
[time=1041] Worship Center.
[time=1042] But you caught my mistake, I think I gave him the wrong date.
[time=1045] Don't listen to me, listen to him, he's the tree expert.
[time=1048] I wish we could tell you just call or write in and we'll help you out, but we have so many people who want tickets, so many tickets to pass out, the only way we can be fair and manage this whole situation is to ask you to come on that day, Saturday, November the 11th.
[time=1064] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, we have this booklet to share with you.
[time=1069] It's titled How In The World Is It Going To End, Book Two.
[time=1073] During the month of October, we offer to you Book One, which were four lessons about when Jesus Christ is coming again, events that the Bible talks about, like the rapture of the church.
[time=1084] In Book Two, we go a little further into the book of Revelation, and we begin to discuss things like Daniel's War of the Worlds and the Battle of Armageddon.
[time=1093] And when Christ comes a second time and establishes His kingdom that will last 1,000 years, well
[time=1100] this booklet is meant to be a Bible study guide.
[time=1102] In fact, we're using it as our guide in our Sunday evening services.
[time=1106] I had the privilege of writing the book and the graphics were put together by our youth pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=1110] The book is full of excellent maps and illustrations.
[time=1114] We want to send you a copy if you'll simply write to us.
[time=1117] You can receive a copy of this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour today at 7,400 East
[time=1123] State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1129] Once again, write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1138] Thank you, Pete.
[time=1139] In the beginning of our service, we had the privilege of hearing our children's choir joining with the adult choir.
[time=1144] And now as we join our church family again, you'll have the opportunity of hearing from Keith and stars they sing for us.
[time=1151] Thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1174] Early in the morning, our songs shall rise to thee.
[time=1189] Holy, holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons, bless the Trinity.
[time=1219] Holy, holy, holy, holy, all the saints are dorly, casting down their golden realms
[time=1236] around the blessed sea, share a with and share a fame, falling down before thee.
[time=1253] Holy, holy, holy, Lord, God Almighty, Lord, I would shall praise thy name.
[time=1282] Holy, holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons, bless the Trinity.
[time=1310] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=1335] Thank you, Keith and star and Scott for your accompaniment. I'd like to invite you to bow that we could pray together. Father, the words of that song, the pages of scripture, echo
[time=1348] in our mind. Holy, holy, holy, Father, we stand in awe of who you are. We cannot comprehend
[time=1359] of a God-emissioned, who knows everything. Our mind cannot ponder a God omnipresent,
[time=1367] it was everywhere, always at the same time. We cannot fathom a God who is omnipotent to
[time=1376] consider you control all power. We know so little, he can only be in one place at a time,
[time=1384] and our strength may be strong compared to the person next to us, but it is weak when
[time=1391] we compare it just to the forces of nature. And then, God, we hear from your word and
[time=1398] through music today that you are holy. You are righteous and pure and just in every
[time=1407] thought that you hold, in every step that you take, in every move that you make. And again,
[time=1414] we see the great dichotomy between you and ourselves. And so today, we come to worship
[time=1423] you as a holy God, and we come individually and corporately to confess our sin, our shortcoming.
[time=1434] We ask you to forgive us and to take the precious flow of the blood of Jesus Christ and cover
[time=1441] our sins. We ask you to wash them away. We ask you to lift the blanket of our iniquity
[time=1449] like the sun lifts the morning fog, clean our lives, brighten our spirits. We ask you
[time=1457] to fill us today with your presence. We ask you to give us strength for life's journey.
[time=1466] We particularly pray for the Thompson family and the tragic loss of their daughter Dana.
[time=1471] We ask you to comfort the flowers family and the death of Lloyd's father. We ask you to
[time=1477] give strength to the rain summer's body and her heart and her mind and to their child that she carries. We ask you to protect both mother and child from cancer. We ask you to
[time=1489] give courage to men who have fought hard to maintain a job and they've lost it because
[time=1496] of layoffs or terminations. We ask you to give them a sense of worth in you and to provide
[time=1504] for their families. We ask you now as we open your word that you would teach us strategic
[time=1511] lessons of life in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1519] Have there ever been people in your life that you purposely went out of your way to avoid?
[time=1525] I remember one of the first people in my life was a guy two years old and I am by the name of Johnny Major. Johnny lived a block and a half away. John was one of those guys that he was so smart that he already had his driver's license in the eighth grade. You know, not a lot of IQ but a lot of brawn. John's favorite thing was whenever somebody became a seventh
[time=1546] grader, we had to ride a bus to school, he appointed himself the single force to initiate
[time=1553] everybody. He'd bring tubes of lipstick and when you got off the bus, the hunt was on, he'd grab you, sit on you, which was a near lethal experience itself and then humiliate you with lipstick. I remember knowing John, I remember jumping out the fire escape with the bus and running about four blocks out of the way just to get home because John was somebody I didn't want to see. I remember my high school Latin teacher. I had Latin
[time=1579] on the second floor of Calga Falls High School. I also had geometry and government on that
[time=1585] floor but I would go from government to geometry by going up to the third floor, across the
[time=1591] hall and down the other stairway so I didn't have to walk past my Latin teacher. He was a man you wanted to avoid at all costs. I mean there's something odd about a guy who wants to grab you in the hallway and ask if you can decline and now or conjugate a verb.
[time=1606] I also remember going to a dentist, actually an endodontist who announced that he was about
[time=1612] to extract four of my wisdom teeth and that he needed to tell me that there was a slight
[time=1618] chance that they may damage one nerve and I could have a speech impediment. I informed
[time=1624] him there wasn't a chance in the world. I unclip the bib and he never saw me after that.
[time=1629] There are people in life that you want to avoid. I met one of those individuals in my
[time=1636] somewhere around four to eight hour tour of duty with the army. Back in 1971 I was drafted
[time=1642] but didn't pass the physical but that brief stay acquainted me with drill sergeants, somebody
[time=1649] who I'm glad to know at a distance. In Luke chapter seven we meet one of those people
[time=1655] that you like to avoid, a Roman centurion who was the ancient equivalent to our modern
[time=1662] day drill sergeant. Allow me to read this passage for you, Luke chapter seven verses
[time=1670] one through ten, a drill sergeant with an unusual spirit. When Jesus had finished saying all
[time=1680] this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. There a centurion's servant whom
[time=1688] his master valued highly was sick and about to die. The centurion heard of Jesus and sent
[time=1695] some of the elders of the Jews to him asking him to come and heal his servant. When they
[time=1703] came to Jesus they pleaded earnestly with him. This man deserves to have you do this
[time=1711] because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue. So Jesus went with them. He
[time=1719] was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him, Lord, don't trouble
[time=1727] yourself for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. That is why I did not even
[time=1734] consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my servant will be healed.
[time=1743] For I myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me. I tell this one, go and
[time=1751] he goes and that one, come and he comes. I say to my servant, do this and he does it.
[time=1761] When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him and turning to the crowd following him he
[time=1767] said, I tell you, I have not found such great faith in Israel. Then the men who had been
[time=1774] sent returned to the house and found the servant well. A Roman centurion was a seasoned soldier.
[time=1784] He had earned both his stripes and his respect in the heat of the battle. His sharp mind
[time=1791] and courageous spirit and commanding way had elevated him to the position of a junior
[time=1797] officer. Typically he commanded 100 men in camp and on the battlefield. Experience had
[time=1806] taught him not to seek a fight, but he would not turn away from one either. He would rather
[time=1812] die than give up his ground. His men knew that as well. His harsh, domineering nature had
[time=1822] matured them from youths to young warriors. Most of them had no actual fighting experience
[time=1830] but they had already reached the conclusion they would hold their ground with him. They
[time=1836] had rather faced the enemy as him. Yet there was more than fear that bonded the troops
[time=1845] to the centurion. As their drill sergeant, they at first hated him. Time had tempered
[time=1853] their maverick spirits. Now they respected him because they respected themselves for
[time=1860] what he had made out of them. Loyalty and respected had been braided together with their
[time=1866] original fear. He was an enigma. His heart seemed as impervious as the breastplate that
[time=1875] protected it. Yet through his harsh manner and abrasive tone they somehow sensed that
[time=1881] he cared very deeply about them. Mysteriously he was always around, yet always unapproachable.
[time=1891] The line between ranks had been clearly drawn. Their relationship was strictly military,
[time=1898] nothing personal. Any exchange of words came in formal commands, not friendly conversation.
[time=1907] I think I'm out there!
[time=1937] Lift, lift, wake up out there, open your Bibles, make yourselves proud.
[time=1945] White, I expect that Bible verse to be memorized next week.
[time=1950] Thank you, our Roman centurion and our modern-day drill sergeant, some of the people in life that you would like to avoid.
[time=1958] Thank you, men.
[time=1960] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1966] In Luke chapter 7, we find a Roman centurion who looked a lot like Hal
[time=1974] and who carried himself a lot like Mike.
[time=1977] He was not paid to be friendly.
[time=1979] It wasn't anywhere in his job description to be popular or to be kind.
[time=1985] His job was to drill men, to discipline them, to equip them, and then lead them into battle.
[time=1993] But this unnamed centurion in Luke chapter 7 is an unusual man, and he teaches us three strategic lessons for life.
[time=2004] Here's lesson number one we can learn from this unusual centurion.
[time=2009] It is this, you can be tough and still be tender.
[time=2015] As a centurion, he had the hardest job.
[time=2019] One historian said that the centurions were the backbone of the entire Roman army.
[time=2025] Rome advanced in legions.
[time=2028] Each legion would be divided into 10 cohorts.
[time=2032] Each cohort would be divided into 60 groups of a century, 100 men,
[time=2039] with a centurion over them.
[time=2042] While some of the field officers might be on a hill, others on an observation tower, it was the centurion who strapped on his breastplate
[time=2051] and put a shield in one hand and a sword in the other and actually said to the men, "Follow me," and led them in the battle.
[time=2061] He was tough.
[time=2063] If he was stationed in a tranquil land, he had equally as tough duties.
[time=2068] He was in charge of his military station.
[time=2072] He had such undesirable task of carrying out the execution of condemned criminals.
[time=2078] It was a centurion, you'll recall, who oversaw the crucifixion of Jesus.
[time=2084] These were some of the toughest men who have ever trampled on the earth.
[time=2089] Polybus, the historian, said a centurion was not a seeker after danger,
[time=2095] but one who could command men.
[time=2098] They were ready in action, reliable.
[time=2101] They ought never to rush into a fight, but when hard pressed, they must be ready to hold their ground and to die at their post.
[time=2111] A centurion was, in every way, a man's man.
[time=2117] He could never show a kink in his armor or a soft spot in his heart.
[time=2122] He was to be tough, and all of them were.
[time=2127] This centurion, along with all of his toughness, shows a remarkable tenderness.
[time=2135] We find him sending a delegation of his friends to Jesus seeking the help
[time=2144] in behalf of one of his servants.
[time=2147] That makes a little bit of sense to us, but allow me to repaint it more accurately.
[time=2153] In this world, there were three classes of people.
[time=2157] There were patricians, a father.
[time=2160] Those were the nobility of that world.
[time=2164] Below them, there were the plebeians, the commoners.
[time=2169] A centurion would be numbered amongst them.
[time=2172] But then there were a third class of people, servants, slaves.
[time=2178] And the line between what was viewed as human and what was not human was drawn below the plebeians and above the slaves.
[time=2188] Aristotle, speaking for the Greeks and writers in Latin, spoke for the Romans, equally declared that a slave was not a person, he was a thing.
[time=2200] And here we find a Roman NCO showing remarkable compassionate for one of his servants.
[time=2210] It even goes a little beyond that because it says that he valued him highly.
[time=2216] Now in our mercenary society, many of us just heard dollars and cents when I said valued highly, but that's not the import of these words.
[time=2225] The King James Bible translates these words, "Dear." And in 1 Peter, when they are used to describe the Lord Jesus Christ, the word is used to say that he is the precious cornerstone.
[time=2238] It's not a financial word, it's a word of human relationship.
[time=2243] The point is, here is a Roman, a plebeian, caring about a non-Roman, a slave.
[time=2253] In those days, a slave was considered expendable and replaceable.
[time=2259] But there's something about this Roman centurion, but he shows remarkable tenderness.
[time=2266] It even comes to the light a little further because between verses 3 and 7,
[time=2273] he changes words.
[time=2275] Both of them are translated servant, but the first one means slave or bond servant, but later he says, "Speak the word, and my servant will be healed." It's a different word than do-loss.
[time=2286] It's a word that means child.
[time=2289] It can mean servant, but it speaks of somebody who's considered a part of the family, a part of the household.
[time=2297] This centurion is showing unusable and remarkable tenderness.
[time=2303] And he gives us a great example in life that men, we can be tough, and we can still be tender.
[time=2310] I liken him to an individual I grew up watching on television, and then remarkably my children grew up watching the same individual.
[time=2319] His name was Merlin Olson.
[time=2322] Back in the '60s, the Rams were one of the toughest defensive teams in the NFL,
[time=2328] and their front four defensive linemen were called the Fearson Forson, Deacon Jones, Merlin Olson, Rosie Greer, and Lamar Lundy, they ate quarterbacks for dinner.
[time=2342] And yet somehow Merlin Olson went from the Fearson Forson to Father Murthy.
[time=2348] He went from being a man tackling a football to a man selling flowers,
[time=2356] a remarkable man who was tough and tender.
[time=2360] This centurion was such a man. He was both.
[time=2364] He was tough, and yet he can be tender.
[time=2369] If it teaches us anything, it teaches us this.
[time=2372] We need to shape our jobs and not let our jobs shape us.
[time=2377] Some of you, like Mike, or law enforcement officers in our city, and you're paid, and you need to be tough.
[time=2385] Some of you are in charge of discipline at a high school, and your job is to be tough.
[time=2392] Others of you are forming over a motley crew, and somehow you're to take this production line and make it profitable, and you're not going to get it done by carrying flowers into the boys.
[time=2404] Others of you are chief executive officers and companies that are going to be hard-pressed to show a profit this year.
[time=2412] Your job is to get in there and to be a tough-minded manager, to crunch the numbers and the people holding the numbers if that's what it takes, because if you don't show a profit this year, there won't be a next year.
[time=2425] Your job calls you to be tough.
[time=2429] Some of you are school teachers and are wisely taking Dr. Dobson's advice and dared to discipline when he advises every school teacher never to smile until Thanksgiving break.
[time=2442] All of us need to be tough at times, but yet we also need to be tender.
[time=2450] Nobody modeled that better than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2454] Jesus knew how to be tender.
[time=2456] He knew how to go into a city, and when there would be mothers with their little children, he knew to go over and pick up a baby and hold it.
[time=2464] He knew to bid the little children to come to him.
[time=2466] He knew how to crush their heads as their mothers would gleam and say, "The master cares about my Johnny." That same Jesus could take those same hands and he could braid three straps of leather together
[time=2479] and he could storm through the gates of the temple.
[time=2481] He could upend the tables of the money-changers and drive their animals out with a whip.
[time=2487] He could be tough.
[time=2490] He could be tender.
[time=2493] In one moment of Jesus' life, he was both his toughest and his tenderest at the exact same instant.
[time=2502] It was the time when he stretched out his arms and exposed his palms to another Roman centurion
[time=2512] who nailed his hands across.
[time=2516] Can you imagine how tough it would be when you have all the power in the world to speak and you could knock the Roman army off their feet?
[time=2525] That's tough.
[time=2528] You imagine how tender a man's heart would have to be to be willing to die for my sins and yours.
[time=2538] If there's anything that God wants us to be, it's to be tough and to be tender.
[time=2545] Some of us err on the sides of being too tough.
[time=2550] We need to remember that our spouse is not our subordinate.
[time=2553] He or she is our partner.
[time=2555] We need to remember our children are not our cadets.
[time=2559] They're our offspring and our heritage.
[time=2562] Some of us need to try a little tenderness.
[time=2566] Others of us have the scale out of balance in the other direction.
[time=2570] We are tender.
[time=2573] We are so tender our kids know they can do anything they want and get away with it.
[time=2578] You see, when they grow up not respecting you, Mom, when they grow up not respecting you, Dad, they grow up not respecting their teacher, their principal, the police officer, they grow up not respecting God.
[time=2593] God will never judge me.
[time=2595] God will never punish me.
[time=2597] I always get away with it.
[time=2602] This Roman centurion was a tough guy, a tough guy.
[time=2607] And yet he showed remarkable tenderness.
[time=2612] It's a strategic lesson in life to be learned.
[time=2620] To be tough and to be tender at the same time.
[time=2625] Here's a second strategic lesson we can learn from this junior officer of the Roman core.
[time=2631] You can be honorable and still be humble.
[time=2635] Hey, this guy was somebody.
[time=2638] He was, first of all, a centurion.
[time=2641] Did you see how regularly how was dressed?
[time=2644] That one struck an image in any Palestinian town.
[time=2647] When people hardly had clothing to wear, here he came in white linen with a scarlet cape,
[time=2654] a bronze sword and shield, a breastplate made out of metal.
[time=2659] He struck a gleam out of the sun that reflected in the eyes, jealousy, a very Palestinian man.
[time=2668] He could have intimidated by his position, or he could have insisted by his authority that Jesus come to his house, but he didn't.
[time=2678] He was probably the officer with the highest rank in all of Galilee.
[time=2685] The Romans didn't have a full legion or cohort stationed in the north.
[time=2688] They were down with Pilate in the south, but there was a garrison assigned to Heron.
[time=2694] Probably this centurion was the chief ranking officer.
[time=2698] When he walked through the streets, he was the son buddy.
[time=2703] Only was he a centurion, but beyond that he was civic minded.
[time=2709] He had endeared himself to the people, and the Jewish people over whom he ruled
[time=2716] said, "He loves our nation," and they wanted to go to bat for him.
[time=2722] Somewhere along the way this guy had learned early in life that if you want people to like you, the best way to make that happen is to like them.
[time=2731] Have you ever been in that spot where you didn't really think you liked somebody?
[time=2735] You weren't quite sure why, and you just didn't quite like them, and you were suspicious that they didn't quite like you.
[time=2742] So you kept your distance, and then a second party says to you, "Hey, do you know such and such and in your mind?" "Yeah, I know such and such, and I bet you've got something to tell me about such and such." He was just talking about you the other day, "Oh, I wonder what that turkey said about me." "Oh, really? What did he say?" He was saying, "What a fine job you're doing and how he hopes you get the promotion in the company." "Yeah, I always thought he was a good guy, too. I kind of like him." Human nature is the like the people who like us.
[time=2776] This Roman centurion learned it early, and he showed remarkable compassion and tenderness,
[time=2783] and the people of Galilee loved him, and their remark was, "He loves our nation."
[time=2789] I can't begin to express to you how rare that is, because the Jews hated the Gentiles,
[time=2796] the Romans in particular, and the Romans didn't have any better esteem of the Jews.
[time=2802] That's reflected in Pilate's word when he's interviewing Jesus, and Jesus asked Pilate a question, and Pilate would discuss, "What do you think I am? I'm not a Jew." There's hostility between Romans and Jews, but not between the people of Galilee and this centurion,
[time=2821] because he was civic-minded. He loved those people, and he went so far as to build their synagogue.
[time=2828] Now, I think the import of the word is not that he was out there with a masons trowel in his hand laying block.
[time=2834] I think it meant that he was in charge of their capital funds drive, celebrate God's grace, help us build a new sanctuary.
[time=2841] He was a major donor.
[time=2844] They respected him and liked him for it. They considered him a very honorable man.
[time=2850] Thirdly, he was not only a centurion, not only a civic leader, but he was very successful.
[time=2857] Then and now you do not become rich being a soldier.
[time=2861] But somehow this man had managed his money, saved it, and invested it well that he didn't live in a barracks.
[time=2868] He had a house, and he had a household, and he even had servants.
[time=2872] He even had enough money to become the major philanthropist of the city of Capernaum.
[time=2878] It was a very respected and honorable person.
[time=2882] Notice chapter 7, verse 4, how the community esteemed him.
[time=2887] When they, that's the Jewish contingent, came to Jesus.
[time=2891] They pleaded earnestly with Jesus saying, "This man deserves to have you do it."
[time=2901] Yet notice this honorable man's humility.
[time=2905] He takes just the opposite response. They said he deserves it.
[time=2909] Here's what he says in verse 6.
[time=2912] He was not far from the house from the centurion sent friends to Jesus and said, "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof."
[time=2924] That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you.
[time=2930] Here was an honorable man who showed remarkable humility.
[time=2936] The whole community said, "Hey, this guy deserves to have you come."
[time=2942] And his response is, "I don't deserve that you would even come to my house."
[time=2949] Pride is such a dangerous thing. Humility is its only anecdote.
[time=2956] These three little critters were the best of friends, two ducks in a frog.
[time=2962] The ducks noticed that the pond was draining and would soon be dry.
[time=2966] They had flown around and scouted out another pond just about a quarter mile away, an easy flight for them, but a long hop for a frog.
[time=2975] The frog said, "I've got an idea. Why don't you guys find a stick about this long?" If each of you puts the stick in your bill, and if I bite it in the middle,
[time=2986] when you fly away, you can just carry me over to that next pond.
[time=2989] They thought that was a great idea. They found the stick, took the flight, carrying their little frog, hanging on by his mouth.
[time=2996] They just got right over the barn and the farmer looked up and said, "Now, that is a brilliant idea. Who thought of that?" And the frog said, "I did." Pride is so dangerous.
[time=3009] A pastor was speaking on it one Sunday morning and a lady in his church came up afterwards and thanked him for his words that had spoken to her heart.
[time=3018] She was so overcome with pride that she found herself sitting by the hour in front of the mirror.
[time=3023] He said, "Madam, your problem is not a sin of pride. It's a sin of the imagination."
[time=3030] This Roman centurion did not struggle with pride.
[time=3036] He could have, by the laws of his day, walked up to Jesus and said,
[time=3043] "You pick up that equipment of mine and carry it to my house." And he could immediately conscript him into service.
[time=3052] Instead, he says, "I'm not worthy to come to you myself.
[time=3058] I'm not even worthy for you to stand under my roof.
[time=3062] Just speak the word and my servant will be healed." He reminds me of a baseball player over a year ago by the name of Oral Hersheiser.
[time=3073] Last year, Oral Hersheiser won 23 games and he pitched 59 consecutive innings without giving up a run.
[time=3084] He led the Dodgers into the World Series and they defeated the Oakland Athletics four games and swept the series.
[time=3094] When it was over, Oral Hersheiser was voted the most valuable player in Major League Baseball.
[time=3101] 24 hours later, he was in one of the hottest chairs in America, the one immediately to Johnny Carson's right.
[time=3109] Johnny Carson had heard about Oral and said, "I understand that to keep yourself calm and under control you sing a little bit."
[time=3119] And Hersheiser is neither a wit or a vocalist.
[time=3125] And he kind of in the good old boy way said, "Well, yeah, I kind of sing a little bit." And Carson said, "Well, what are you saying?" And he said, "Oh, mostly hymns." And he said, "Well, sing something for us." Oh, no, he couldn't bring himself to do that.
[time=3138] But Carson insisted with unbelievable humility, a million dollar baseball player,
[time=3146] the most valuable baseball player that year in the big leagues humbly sang "The Doxology."
[time=3157] He said, "Praise God from whom all blessings flow. Praise Him all creatures here below. Praise Him the heavenly host. Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."
[time=3169] You know, most athletes would say, "Yeah, when I get in the gym, I just really concentrate 'cause I've got a split finger fastball that nobody can hit."
[time=3181] Here's a man that said, "I think about my Lord, and I give Him praise and glory."
[time=3188] And you know what? You can be honorable, and you can still be humble.
[time=3194] Wouldn't it be great if you were the head of your organization or the foreman on your shift, the director of your company or its CEO?
[time=3202] And when people saw you on the floor and a stranger walked in, they wouldn't know right away that you were the boss.
[time=3212] You're honorable, but you're so humble that you're one of us.
[time=3219] The third and most important lesson this Roman Centurion teaches us is this one.
[time=3224] You can be strong, and you can still be spiritual. As a Roman Centurion, he had to be strong mentally.
[time=3232] He had to be strong physically, and he had to be strong emotionally.
[time=3236] He didn't say, "You attack over there, and you sweep the flank." He said, "You follow me," and he marched in the battle.
[time=3244] Probably, most of them had more than a few scars as their badge of courage.
[time=3250] Mentally, he ran a dictatorship, not a democracy.
[time=3255] He couldn't let the sneers or the jeers of his men alter what he thought was right and best.
[time=3263] He had to be mentally tougher than the voices of 100 complaining soldiers.
[time=3269] Emotionally, he had to unquestionably follow orders, unemotionally carry out executions, and unflinchingly discipline his men, even if they were just boys.
[time=3282] He had to be strong in every way, and yet he teaches us that you can be spiritual.
[time=3289] First of all, notice that he's kept his ear to the ground spiritually.
[time=3294] This is early in Jesus' ministry, but he's already heard of Jesus.
[time=3298] He's got a sensitive heart. He's looking. He's listening.
[time=3301] He's a searcher and a seeker.
[time=3304] Secondly, he's a man of keen observation.
[time=3310] Imagine a Roman officer calling a Palestinian carpenter, "Lord."
[time=3321] But he recognized who Jesus was.
[time=3324] And then notice his remarkable faith.
[time=3327] Faith that Jesus says he's never seen amongst all the nation of Israel, that this man said, "I am a soldier.
[time=3333] If I say to this one, go, he goes. If I say to this one, come, he comes." And he said, "Jesus, I recognize that your Lord and God, and you don't even have to come.
[time=3341] All you have to do is say the word and my servant will be healed."
[time=3348] The greatest lie that's hit the men of this century is this one.
[time=3353] Christianity is a crutch for weak people.
[time=3359] You can be strong, and you can be spiritual.
[time=3364] During World War II, a young man had risen to the ranks of a navy pilot.
[time=3369] He was the youngest American to become a navy pilot.
[time=3373] He was flying a bombing mission in the Pacific Theater.
[time=3377] His plane was shot.
[time=3379] His crewman was dead.
[time=3381] He alone was alive in an airplane on fire.
[time=3386] Our airman saw the destination, and he also saw the smoke of his own aircraft.
[time=3393] And he determined that he would finish his mission.
[time=3395] And he pointed his plane in the direction of his target, and he dove in, dropped his payload,
[time=3401] turned out the sea being shot up again, ejected himself into the water, inflated a raft,
[time=3407] and began rowing not knowing where he would row to when a United States submarine emerged
[time=3413] out of the water and rescued George Bush.
[time=3418] In 1984, George Bush, a strong man's man, was asked this question whether he had been born again.
[time=3427] He said, "I've discussed this many times with some of the great thinkers of our day, especially Billy Graham.
[time=3433] I would like to ask for a definition.
[time=3436] If by born again one is asking, do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, then
[time=3442] I could answer clear-cut yes, no hesitancy."
[time=3454] We appreciate the opportunity to share with you the ministry of our sanctuary's choir, and our children's choirs, the group celebration, and Keith and Star Brodigum.

[time=3467] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3477] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that I have this opportunity to come before you today
[time=3483] and to tell you that I have committed sins that I ask for your forgiveness.
[time=3487] And I ask you to come into my heart and be my Savior today.
[time=3492] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3496] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3500] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
