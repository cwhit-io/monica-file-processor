[time=31] In 1829, George Wilson was executed by hanging
[time=37] when he refused to receive a pardon from President Andrew Jackson and many of us are exactly like him.
[time=46] [MUSIC]
[time=59] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=65] Rick's message today is entitled "Dying Men Who Made Desperate Decisions." From the actions of the thieves who are crucified on each side of Jesus, we can diagnose two terminal thoughts about faith in Christ.
[time=78] One man teaches us that we should never assume that it is too late to come to Christ.
[time=83] The other teaches the same lesson that we learn from the execution of George Wilson in 1829
[time=89] that we can never presume that we will come to Christ later.
[time=93] We encourage you to find your Bible and open it to Luke 23 and study with us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=101] Rick's text is taken from the book of Luke, Chapter 23, verses 32 through 43.
[time=108] Our special music today includes a song from Tim Teder and an instrumental duet from Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=118] We now join our service as the Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra bring us a number entitled "Sinner Saved by Grace."
[time=128] [MUSIC - 239 seconds]
[time=387] Let's continue our singing together by turning to him number 405.
[time=395] Him number 405.
[time=398] [MUSIC]
[time=401] This thing together stands as one, two, and four.
[time=405] [MUSIC - 106 seconds]
[time=521] Thank you for your fine singing this morning.
[time=523] Tim Teder comes now to minister to us in music.
[time=541] [MUSIC - 244 seconds]
[time=813] A moment ago, as we left our morning worship service, you had the privilege of hearing Tim Teder, our youth pastor sing. Tim is a diversely talented young man, and we're thrilled to have him as a part of our team here at Blackhawk. Peter, you're having a little more difficulty singing than usual today though.
[time=830] Yes, I just had a little trouble with the tooth this week and kind of had quite a bit of swelling, and it's beginning to go down now, but quite a few complications this week.
[time=840] Well, other than the word cancer, probably root canal is the next most feared word in America, and that's what you had trouble with.
[time=846] It's a very sore process, but once it's taken care of, and we have good specialists in our area, for which I'm thankful.
[time=853] Well, it was important that we talk about that, because we don't want people to think you had a chalk tobacco in your mouth right here on the Bible hour.
[time=860] Well, I certainly hope that heals up and gets better for you. Thank you, Rick.
[time=864] The living Christmas tree is upon us, and that means a lot of responsibilities for you and a lot of requests for tickets.
[time=870] Well, as the people are viewing this particular program, we've had the public distribution, but if you're interested in tickets, you can call the Blackhawk Baptist Church to see what concerts are open, and we can reserve tickets for you.
[time=882] So you could call 493 7400 between the hours of nine and five during the work week, and we'll let you know what concerts are still open, and then you can pick up tickets right here at the church.
[time=896] Well, we're looking forward to the living Christmas tree. I've already begun to think of the content of the five to eight minute message I'll be sharing.
[time=904] I've listened to much of the music, and I'm excited about sharing Christ through the living Christmas tree this year.
[time=909] It's always a fun time, Rick, and a great opportunity to have our friends come and join with us during the holiday season to hear the birth of the Savior.
[time=917] Well, we hope many of you will be able to come, and we can bridge not only from our home to your home by way of television, but we could meet in person and share Jesus Christ through the living Christmas tree with each of you.
[time=929] Again, we want to invite you to call Monday through Friday from nine to five, and you'll be able to get information to see what concerts still have tickets available.
[time=938] So we hope you'll do that. Our number again is 493 7400.
[time=944] We also have a booklet to share with you today. It's the second in a two-part series. It's titled "How in the World Is It Going to End?"
[time=953] It's a study of the End Times. We've written books one and two. Tim Teder, our youth pastor who you met a moment ago singing.
[time=960] He and I have worked together on this project. I had the privilege of writing the actual book, and Tim is an excellent computer graphic artist, and he has done a number of maps, diagrams, charts to help us follow through in the Bible study.
[time=974] In the times in which we live, we see the increase of war and the rumors of war, yet at the same time we see the increase of a cry for peace, peace.
[time=983] Both of those are things that Jesus foretold would characterize the End Times.
[time=988] This booklet goes as our attempt to explain the biblical content of how the world is going to end.
[time=995] Book two that we're offering to you today focuses chiefly on the Battle of Armageddon, the return of Christ, and the establishment of Christ's Kingdom on Earth.
[time=1005] We'd love to send you a copy as a gift from us to you if you would simply write and request it today.
[time=1011] Please write for this helpful booklet to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1021] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1030] Well, Peter, I want to thank you for doing this time with me, and I know that you're not feeling the best, and we all hope that your tooth not only gets better, but it never gets bad again.
[time=1040] Thank you.
[time=1041] And we want to thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1045] As we go back to our morning worship service, we have the privilege of hearing a string duet. Dave and Debbie Johnson, a husband and wife,
[time=1052] she'll be playing the violin, he'll be playing the viola, and we'll be having the opportunity of praising God together.
[time=1058] Thanks for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1075] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=1253] [MUSIC]â™ª
[time=1267] Thank you, Dave and Debbie, for your ministry on the strings, and Scott, for your always-find accompaniment.
[time=1273] I'd like to invite you to bow and accompany me as we pray together.
[time=1280] Our Father, who art in heaven, would you right now thank God quietly in your heart for being your Father.
[time=1292] Hollywood be thy name. Would you praise God for one of his attributes? Tell him now why you, Hollywood's name.
[time=1301] Is it his love, his mercy, his justice, his unchanging way, his great power?
[time=1311] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=1318] Would you submit yourself afresh to God's will?
[time=1322] Would you tell him now that you promised that you'll obey him in that choice that you've been weighing?
[time=1331] Give us this day our daily bread. Ask the Father now for what it is that you want.
[time=1339] Just like Rachel, Rebecca or Adam would come to Kathy or me. Ask him now.
[time=1347] Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Ask God for his mercy and his grace.
[time=1356] Jesus be his forgiving with others as you want him to be with you.
[time=1362] Ask him not to lead you into temptation, but to give you spiritual strength that your life will be for his glory.
[time=1371] Thank you Lord that you've taught us to pray. Thank you that you hear when we do. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1383] One of my usual responsibilities of a pastor is that of performing funerals.
[time=1390] It's not something that I look forward to, but it's not something that I regret either.
[time=1395] It is a great time of ministry. People have much better hearing at funerals than they do at weddings.
[time=1402] This particular funeral was very, very unusual. It started off with a phone call a couple of weeks ahead of time.
[time=1411] A man who I had not recalled meeting asked if I would come visit him. He had cancer. He was dying and he knew it.
[time=1420] I went to their home. We struck up an almost immediate friendship. We began to talk of how our lives had overlapped in a few mutual friends.
[time=1429] He had attended a funeral. Thought I had done okay and when his time came, maybe I ought to do his. He said it humorously, but he half-minute.
[time=1438] He went on to say that he had watched by way of television. He had been watching the Bible hour in his home.
[time=1444] He had discovered through a treatment that he had cancer and that he was dying.
[time=1450] Our conversation went from light to serious and I had the opportunity of telling him about Christ and how Christ could forgive his sins and give him a home in heaven.
[time=1461] I said, "Don, would you like to receive Christ?" He looked at me with honesty and with a look that said, "Hocks, you must be the dumbest guy I've ever talked to."
[time=1470] He said, "Of course I do. Isn't that why I called you to come over here?" And right then with decisiveness, Don accepted Christ as his savior, but he did something I've never known any other man to do.
[time=1486] Within two weeks he had made a phone call. He had called his grown family who were all gone out of the house back home and they gladly came to visit their father.
[time=1496] He said on the edge of a bed, appearing to be strong, but cancer and chemotherapy had already begun to take their mark.
[time=1503] But out of strength he told them that he had given his heart to Christ. He was not ashamed of that.
[time=1509] He told them how he had always loved them and he had done the best to be a good father and he had been a good father.
[time=1515] He told them if they didn't know Christ that they needed to.
[time=1519] And with that, Don laid down on his hospital bed in just a few days earlier, months before any of us believed it, he died.
[time=1528] It was a dying man who made desperate decisions and every one of them were right.
[time=1535] I'd like to tell you about two other men, dying men who also made desperate decisions.
[time=1540] They're found in the Gospel according to Luke in the 23rd chapter.
[time=1544] If you have a Bible, search out the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament, the third book, Matthew Mark Luke.
[time=1552] In Luke chapter 23 we meet these two dying men who made desperate decisions in Luke 23 verse 32.
[time=1563] It reads like this.
[time=1566] Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.
[time=1573] When they came to the place called the skull, there they crucified him along with the criminals.
[time=1582] One on the right, the other on his left.
[time=1587] Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[time=1597] And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
[time=1602] The people stood watching, the rulers even sneered at him.
[time=1608] They said, he saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the chosen one.
[time=1619] The soldiers also came up and mocked him.
[time=1623] They offered him wine vinegar and said, "If you're the king of the Jews, save yourself."
[time=1631] There was a written notice above him which read, "This is the king of the Jews."
[time=1639] One of the criminals who hung their hurled insults at him, "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
[time=1649] But the other criminal rebuked him.
[time=1652] "Don't you fear God?" he said.
[time=1655] "Once you're under the same sentence, we are punished justly for them. We are getting what our deeds deserve.
[time=1663] But this man has done nothing wrong." Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
[time=1675] Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth. Today you will be with me in paradise."
[time=1684] Two dying men who made desperate decisions.
[time=1688] From these two thieves, these dying men hung upon each side of Jesus,
[time=1695] we can make a diagnosis of two terminal truths about coming to faith in Christ.
[time=1702] The first truth is this one.
[time=1705] It is never too late to come to Christ.
[time=1710] Never assume that it's too late to come to Christ.
[time=1715] The other terminal truth is this one.
[time=1718] Never presume that you will come later.
[time=1723] Let's look at those thoughts one at a time.
[time=1726] Two thieves, two men under the same charge, two men fulfilling the same executioner's song.
[time=1735] Two completely opposite responses to their situation and the Christ that hung between them.
[time=1743] The first man is remarkably repentant.
[time=1747] The other is remarkably unrepentant.
[time=1751] The first man teaches us this simple lesson.
[time=1754] It is never too late to come to Christ and don't think for a moment.
[time=1759] Don't make that assumption that it's too late for you to come to Christ.
[time=1764] Most of us feel like it's impossible to make a mid-course correction in our faith.
[time=1771] That's not true.
[time=1772] This thief didn't make a mid-course correction.
[time=1775] He waited until the ship was just about to come into harbor and he jumped ship.
[time=1780] It's never too late to come to Christ.
[time=1784] Most of us struggle with what we call deathbed conversions.
[time=1789] It first of all strikes us as being insincere.
[time=1794] And yet Jesus didn't chide this man for his insincereity at all.
[time=1798] Jesus didn't say, "Now's a fine time to look to me."
[time=1804] Jesus didn't say, "Hey, where were you when I was in Galilee?
[time=1808] Or where were you when I was drugged before the magistrates?" He doesn't mock him or taunt him or do anything but affirm him.
[time=1818] Others of us look at this and we say it's unfair.
[time=1823] We have in the back of our minds a misconception that it's not fair for somebody to go to heaven
[time=1833] who's lived a wicked life and repents on their last breath.
[time=1839] And it seems doubly unfair that this guy could have been a wonderful citizen, a good father, a noble husband, a trustworthy employee, but rejected Christ.
[time=1851] And after that relatively good life ends up in hell and this man ends up in heaven.
[time=1858] That strikes all of us as unfair, that people didn't get what they deserved.
[time=1863] Well, we misunderstand about one single word in the scripture.
[time=1868] It's the word grace. It means that God gives what He gives us freely apart from any merit on our side of the ledger.
[time=1881] We fail to see that salvation, a home in heaven, is an absolute total gift from God.
[time=1890] We somehow think, "Yeah, God gives it to us, but we've got to do something to earn it." We miss the whole point. Trying to earn our way to heaven, some will do better than others.
[time=1904] But it's like trying to long jump from here to Hawaii.
[time=1908] Some will do better than others, but no one's going to make it.
[time=1913] Suppose we stood on the beach in Santa Barbara, California, and there three people were going to make their attempt to long jump to Hawaii.
[time=1923] The first is an octogenarian in a wheelchair who was never real athletic to begin with.
[time=1929] She rolls up to the beach, crawls out of her chair and wets her toes at the starting line,
[time=1935] and makes her jump and doesn't get her feet off of the ground.
[time=1942] Up then walks a young spry, 37-year-old athlete in the prime of his life.
[time=1951] Wets his toes at the starting line.
[time=1954] Fields with the cascading waters coming in, sets his eyes in the direction that he believes in Hawaii,
[time=1961] and makes a startling leap, impressing the crowd, jumping nearly three and a half feet.
[time=1968] Far beyond this lady who crawled out of her wheelchair, then walks up, Carl Lewis.
[time=1977] Olympic gold medal winner stands there and without a running start jumps 12 feet.
[time=1983] The only thing that Carl Lewis accomplished over the rest of us is he was wetter than the rest of us.
[time=1989] He doesn't make it to Hawaii either.
[time=1992] Nobody makes it to Hawaii based upon personal performance in the long jump,
[time=1999] and nobody makes it to heaven based upon personal performance on any spiritual scale.
[time=2006] Carl Lewis would fall far short of the mark of Hawaii, and the most noble person falls far short of the mark of spiritual perfection.
[time=2018] And so it's out of grace that God takes any of us.
[time=2023] Not that he takes some of us.
[time=2026] But others object to somebody coming to Christ in the last moments of their life saying it's unfair.
[time=2032] Jesus gave a parable to illustrate that.
[time=2035] Allow me to put it in modern terminology.
[time=2038] A man has a warehouse, and he has to get all of the goods moved out on his warehouse before six o'clock tonight.
[time=2045] He goes down to the local unemployment line, and he said, "I'm giving any men who will come with me right now at eight o'clock in the morning, and who will work till six o'clock tonight.
[time=2057] I'm going to give them $60 for a day's work, one of the takers."
[time=2063] And a half a dozen men get up and say, "Yeah, I'll work for it." They go and they work for the man, and about noon the man realizes with this crew, "I'm never going to get done by six o'clock." So he goes back to the unemployment line, and he says to the men who are there, "I'll give anybody who will come with me right now at noon and work till six o'clock $60 to work for the rest of the day."
[time=2085] Another half a dozen men sign up, and they go and they begin to work.
[time=2090] Just before four o'clock in the afternoon with these two crews working hard to man realizes he's never going to get his warehouse empty.
[time=2097] And he goes back to the unemployment office just before it's about the close, and he says, "It's four o'clock. If anyone will come work for me between now and six o'clock tonight,
[time=2107] I'll give them $60, and a whole new group of guys showed up."
[time=2113] And at six o'clock they got the job done, and each man showed up to get paid.
[time=2118] The guys who showed up at noon weren't so upset.
[time=2122] They said, "Wait a minute, this isn't fair. I work for six hours. I work through the heat of the day.
[time=2127] These guys show up at four o'clock, put in two hours when it cools off, and you're paying them what you're paying me." It isn't right.
[time=2135] Bam, the elbow hits him. What are you belly aching about?
[time=2138] I've been here for ten hours.
[time=2140] When you showed up, I'd already done more than you have done all day.
[time=2144] I'm getting the same pay as you and that guy.
[time=2147] It isn't fair.
[time=2151] And the point of Jesus' parable is this one.
[time=2154] Whether you come to me in the morning of your life, whether you come to me at the midday of your life, or whether you come to me in the final hours,
[time=2164] I promise you that I'll give you eternal life.
[time=2170] I'm thankful that God's fair, because you see, if God was fair, he'd pay us each fairly.
[time=2176] And what I fairly deserve is death and hell, and I'll gladly settle for $60, a free gift of salvation.
[time=2187] This man illustrates for us that it's never too late to come to Christ.
[time=2195] Some people say, "Well, I've already made my path, and I'll just have to follow." No, you don't.
[time=2204] You said, "Well, I could never live a good enough life to undo what I've already done."
[time=2210] Of course you can't.
[time=2212] None of us can go back and erase the past.
[time=2216] But we can change our ultimate destination.
[time=2221] And that's what this thief on the cross did.
[time=2224] It's interesting to note that he didn't do any of the things that's usually associated with being religious, spiritual, or Christian.
[time=2232] This man never went to church.
[time=2234] He never took baptism or communion.
[time=2237] He was never an official member of any congregation.
[time=2240] He never did any good deeds.
[time=2242] He never gave public testimony in a church service.
[time=2245] He never taught Sunday school or a wana.
[time=2248] Never had to work in the church nursery.
[time=2250] Never had to usher at the Living Christmas tree.
[time=2253] Never had to sing at the top of the tree when he had octrophobia.
[time=2258] He just simply said, "Lord, save me." And Christ did exactly what he asked him to do.
[time=2267] This man, though he didn't have a degree in theology, he was not a Nicodemus,
[time=2273] was a man with great spiritual insight.
[time=2276] He recognized three things.
[time=2278] One, that Jesus was king.
[time=2280] Two, that Jesus had a kingdom that was not of this world.
[time=2284] Three, that Jesus had the power to take an unworthy sinner like him and make him a citizen in that kingdom.
[time=2292] The Romans, whenever they crucified somebody, typically nailed on the cross above their head a plate that would identify the crime for which they were being executed.
[time=2304] So on Jesus' cross it had a plate.
[time=2306] It was nailed there.
[time=2307] His only crime was that he was the king of the Jews.
[time=2312] These two thieves, one on each side, would have a different plaque nailed there.
[time=2316] It might have said armed robbery, assault and battery, breaking and entering and inhabited dwelling in the night season.
[time=2326] But their charges were nailed right there above them.
[time=2331] And one of them looked at Jesus and he recognized that this suffering man
[time=2339] was indeed the king of Israel.
[time=2342] And that though Rome had nailed a sign there in mockery, he believed in sincerity.
[time=2350] He recognized that Jesus was a king.
[time=2353] And he also recognized that Jesus had a kingdom that was not of this world.
[time=2358] He said, "Remember me when you come into your kingdom." He knew that Jesus was the Messiah and that his kingdom was of God not of men.
[time=2366] His kingdom was of heaven and not of earth and he had the faith to believe that.
[time=2372] And finally he had the faith to believe that Jesus had the power to take him
[time=2379] an unworthy sinner and transform him into a citizen, a saint in that kingdom.
[time=2386] His prayer is interesting.
[time=2388] You know when you're going down, you don't become very rhetorical.
[time=2392] His prayer does not lead like a good theological prayer.
[time=2396] Oh, great God of the universe.
[time=2398] We just want to worship you today because you're omniscience.
[time=2407] We want to praise you for your immutable character.
[time=2409] We want to think of all the things you've created and go through all the birds in the air, the animals in the sea, the fish of the earth.
[time=2414] He's dying.
[time=2415] He just says, "Lord, remember me." It reminds me of Peter's prayer.
[time=2421] Peter sees Jesus walking on the water, asked Jesus to bid him to come.
[time=2425] Peter steps out in the boat.
[time=2426] He's walking on water.
[time=2428] But the moment his faith began to fail, so did his feet.
[time=2432] And on his way down, Peter didn't reach in for his ecclesiastical prayer book.
[time=2437] He said, "Lord, save me." Anything else would have been gargling in salt water.
[time=2444] That's all the thief on the cross did, is he said, "Lord, save me."
[time=2451] And this dying man made a desperate decision.
[time=2456] He made it at the last moment, and it was real.
[time=2460] There's a story told that somewhere out west on a boot hill, there is a cemetery of a gunfighter who lost his gunfight on top of his horse.
[time=2468] His tombstone has this apotaph.
[time=2471] Between the saddle and the ground, he mercy sought and mercy found.
[time=2478] Does God save somebody who's lived a life as a gunfighter, as a criminal, or a spiritual ratchet at the last moment?
[time=2485] Yes, he does.
[time=2487] Please, don't assume for a moment that you can't come to Christ because it's too late for you.
[time=2494] Don't say, "I can't come to Christ because I've already rejected him." He will give you this opportunity today to receive him.
[time=2501] Don't say, "I can't come to Christ because I have lived a life and I can't erase it."
[time=2507] He will erase it from his ledger.
[time=2511] But there's a second man who teaches us another terminal lesson.
[time=2515] It's one far more important for most of us to hear today.
[time=2518] It's this one.
[time=2520] Never presume that you will come to Christ later.
[time=2526] The thing that is amazing to me is there are two men, one on each side of Christ,
[time=2532] and each of them is in the same situation.
[time=2535] Each of them has the same opportunity, one repents, and the other one mocks.
[time=2542] I mean, just think for a moment.
[time=2544] This guy can't be too smart.
[time=2547] When you are dying on a cross, this isn't a time to offend anybody.
[time=2552] I mean, even if you don't believe Jesus is God, you don't want to offend anybody just in case.
[time=2558] This dying man is not real smart.
[time=2560] He's like a Buckeye I heard about.
[time=2562] Notice I'm picking on Buckeyes today and not Hoosiers.
[time=2565] These three men were sentenced to die under the guillotine.
[time=2568] The first one, a boilermaker, was put under the guillotine.
[time=2571] The braid was released and it jammed halfway down.
[time=2575] An executioner says, "God has shown mercy, so shall the state, you live." The boilermaker walked away.
[time=2582] This Hoosier was placed there.
[time=2584] The blade was released and it jammed halfway down.
[time=2588] The executioner says, "God has shown mercy, so shall the state, you live."
[time=2594] They brought this Buckeye up and the Buckeye said, "You know, if you fix that one bolt right up there in the corner, this thing will work."
[time=2602] That's not the time to show your brilliance in engineering.
[time=2609] How foolish of this man to be dying and to mock anybody, but he did.
[time=2616] Don't ever presume that you will come to Christ later in its safety postponement.
[time=2621] Let me share with you four reasons.
[time=2624] The first reason is what I'll call a social reason.
[time=2627] Let me ask you to ponder with me a deep theological question.
[time=2634] Why is it that men wear suits and ties in the summer and women wear toeless high heels in the winter?
[time=2642] Think about that.
[time=2643] I'll wear this suit and tie today when it's 50 degrees.
[time=2648] I'll wear this suit and tie next February when the wind chill makes it minus 30.
[time=2652] And I have worn this suit in the summer when it was 100 degrees, not counting the humidity.
[time=2658] And some of you ladies come December when we have four inches of snow that is melted in the slush.
[time=2666] And cars have compacted half of the slush in the ice, so it's slush slide, slush slide.
[time=2674] We'll come in high heel shoes with no toes and try to dance your way through the parking lot.
[time=2682] And one ask the question, why?
[time=2688] And the answer to that question is this, because everybody else is.
[time=2695] Why did I wear a suit and tie today?
[time=2698] Because I like to shorten my life by gradually hanging myself?
[time=2702] No.
[time=2705] Why do you wear toeless high-heeled shoes because your feet are hot in the wintertime?
[time=2710] No.
[time=2711] We do it because everybody else is doing it.
[time=2715] Now look back in Luke 23.
[time=2717] Look at verse 35.
[time=2719] Here's Jesus up here on the cross.
[time=2721] Out here is a great multitude of people.
[time=2723] And you know what they say?
[time=2725] Hey, if you're Jesus, come on down.
[time=2730] First game show host in history.
[time=2733] And the whole crowd is mocking him.
[time=2736] And the soldiers are standing there and they see the crowd mocking him.
[time=2740] You know what they decide?
[time=2742] Hey, it looks like fun.
[time=2744] Hey, if you're Jesus, if you're the king, come on down.
[time=2749] Soldiers saw the people do it, they'd give it.
[time=2751] So this dumb guy's hanging on the cross.
[time=2753] He hears the people, then he hears the soldier and he says, "Hey, if you're Jesus, get yourself down."
[time=2761] Why did he do that?
[time=2763] Because he heard everybody else doing it.
[time=2766] And human nature, whether you're a high school student trying to figure out what to wear to school tomorrow
[time=2773] or you're a chief executive in a big company, we will do what we see everybody else doing.
[time=2779] I grew up in the 60s in the era of non-conformity and all my non-conformist friends called each other the night before to see what they were wearing to school the next day.
[time=2790] That's human nature.
[time=2793] And there are social pressures that are hitting many of you today that are keeping you from coming to Christ.
[time=2800] Some of you are saying, "If I accepted Christ, there are people that work in my business here." And that would spread through the office like wildfire.
[time=2808] There's no way I'm going to give my heart to Christ.
[time=2811] Some of you say, "Huh-uh, I'm not going to give my heart to Christ." If I give my heart to Christ, I've got to look at my wife and my kids and my parents in the face and say, "You're right."
[time=2823] The pressure's too great.
[time=2826] Others of you say, "There's no way I'm going to let anybody in my high school know that I'm a Christian." Social pressure.
[time=2833] You know what that social pressure will stick with you all of your life?
[time=2837] And even a dying thief on the cross only repeats what he hears everybody else say.
[time=2846] And you and I probably won't be different even if we're dying.
[time=2850] Let me give to you a second reason.
[time=2853] I'll call it a spiritual reason.
[time=2856] It is this one.
[time=2858] God in His love and in His mercy, He is wanting every one of us to spend eternity with Him in heaven.
[time=2865] And He is not desiring that one of us spends a second in hell let alone eternity.
[time=2872] And so He comes and He knocks on the door of your heart and He says, "It's me.
[time=2879] It's Jesus.
[time=2881] I love you.
[time=2883] I've died for your sins.
[time=2885] Would you allow me to come in and to take over your life and wash away all these sins?
[time=2891] And would you follow me?" And we glancing through the people of our door quietly slipped the deadbolt across silently
[time=2903] hoping he won't hear it as we secure the door.
[time=2907] And we go back to the family room in the hopes that that intruder on our porch will assume
[time=2914] no one is there.
[time=2917] But Jesus in His love and His mercy comes back another day.
[time=2922] When the weather is different, when the seasons have changed, when your life has new needs and He knocks on the door.
[time=2930] And you go to the side and you gently pull back the curtain and peek between the curtain
[time=2937] and the window cell to see who it is.
[time=2939] And you see that it's the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=2943] And you gently pull the curtain back slowly hoping no one on the porch will notice that someone is home and we leave them outside.
[time=2953] There's a spiritual reason not to presume that you will come to Christ later.
[time=2961] Because you and I have no guarantees that Jesus will ever come to the door of our heart
[time=2967] and knock again.
[time=2968] We have no promise in Scripture that He is an obnoxious salesman who will ring the door
[time=2974] bell till somebody comes.
[time=2979] Friend pointed out to me, Steve, that in Acts 7, God does miraculous things for Israel
[time=2985] and Israel turns away from God.
[time=2988] And God does another intervening in Israel's history miraculously and they turned away from God.
[time=2994] And then again and again God intervened and again and again Israel turned away and ignored him until you come to Acts 7, verse 42 when it says, "But God turned away and gave them
[time=3008] up." Never presume for a moment that you will come to Christ later.
[time=3017] He may not come back and invite you later.
[time=3021] There's a third reason why you cannot presume that you'll come to Christ later.
[time=3026] I'll call it the psychological reason.
[time=3030] That is this, once we have made a decision, we usually stick with our decisions whether
[time=3040] they are right or wrong.
[time=3042] In gambling it's called writing a loser all the way down.
[time=3048] One of my favorite offerters of this year is a man by the name of Bob Foggill.
[time=3054] He wrote a new book and the title of it I'll share with you in a moment.
[time=3058] The opening story goes like this.
[time=3060] A tabloid newspaper carried the following story, stating simply that a small town
[time=3066] emergency squad was summoned to a house where smoke was pouring from an upstairs window.
[time=3072] The crew broke in and found a man in a smoldering bed.
[time=3077] After the man was rescued in the mattress doused, the obvious question was, "How did this happen?" "I don't know," said the man.
[time=3088] "The bed was on fire when I lay down on it."
[time=3094] The author goes on to say more humorously, a colleague of mine sat across the table opened up his lunch pail and said, "I'm tired of the same crummy stuff in my lunch."
[time=3104] Bob said, "I asked, who packed your lunch?" The man said, "I do."
[time=3112] You know, all of our lives were packing our lunch and someday we're going to eat what we put in the bag.
[time=3120] You see, if you pack your lunch like this and you say, "I don't have time for Jesus." You stuff that one in a brown sack.
[time=3127] And then the next day you say, "That's for the women in the week." And you stuff that in your sack.
[time=3132] You say, "I'm going to come to Jesus someday, but I don't want anybody else to know." You stick that one in your sack.
[time=3137] And years go by and Jesus knocks and you don't hear it.
[time=3140] You stick apathy and indifference in your sack.
[time=3143] And someday you're going to sit down at a spiritual table and you're going to open up the sack and that's what you're going to have to eat.
[time=3151] We are old horses and very few of us learn new tricks.
[time=3157] Psychologically, we not only make mistakes, but we make a second mistake.
[time=3162] And that is that we stick to our first mistakes even when we know that they are wrong.
[time=3170] Here's a thief dying on the cross.
[time=3175] And he has spent his life ridiculing society and mocking anyone who's different.
[time=3180] And while he's hanging there, he serves himself the same lunch.
[time=3186] The fourth and final reason I want to share with you is this one.
[time=3189] I'll call it a physical reason.
[time=3191] I'm not trying to use a scare tactic.
[time=3193] I'm just stating the facts.
[time=3197] None of us have the good fortune that these two thieves had.
[time=3202] They may have had a long streak of bad luck, but it ended at last.
[time=3206] Because they had one lucky thing that you and I probably won't have, and that's this.
[time=3212] They knew that this was their last day.
[time=3217] You see, 90% of us will die on a day that we would have never believed would have been our last one.
[time=3225] There's something about human nature that never believes that we are old, and that helps to keep us young.
[time=3232] I'm not knocking it.
[time=3234] Peter Kobe's father was here when he was 74 years old.
[time=3238] We were playing golf, and I said, "Mr. Kobe, how much longer are you going to be here?" And he said, "I've got to go back tomorrow.
[time=3243] There's lots of old people out there that need my help and are counting on me." Pete said, "Dad, how old are those people?" He said, "Oh, a couple of them are 70, 71." He wasn't the old one. They were.
[time=3256] We have, through our supersonics, these ministry, one of the most delightful men in the world.
[time=3261] He is Alvin Watson. He is 75 years old.
[time=3265] I went to visit him a few weeks ago.
[time=3267] We talked for a long time, and I said, "Alv, I'm going to have to go now." And he sat up in his nursing home bed, and he motioned to come a little closer.
[time=3274] And he said, "Say, I like that tie.
[time=3278] Just suppose when you pass on, I could have it." Alv has got his ship in order.
[time=3288] But he illustrates so well the notion that all of us have that I'm going to be here tomorrow.
[time=3294] I'm going to be here next year, and I might as well plan a ten-year plan because I'm always going to be here.
[time=3301] There's almost never a week that goes by that I don't do a funeral or at least a ten-one.
[time=3306] I probably did six or seven in the month of October.
[time=3309] You want to hear something scary?
[time=3311] Only two of them are what I would think and you would think were old people.
[time=3316] Two of them were younger than I was.
[time=3319] The greatest presumptuous air that we could ever make in life is the assumption that I will come to Christ later.
[time=3332] None of us are guaranteed three outs in an inning, and none of us are guaranteed all nine innings of a game.
[time=3340] Some of us here who are young and strong won't be here next year when it's Thanksgiving time.
[time=3351] It's just the reality of it.
[time=3353] I'm not trying to scare you. I'm not trying to frighten you.
[time=3356] I'm just standing here as a pastor who buries two or three children a year who does the funerals of lots of people younger than he is.
[time=3365] I tell you don't presume for a moment that you will come to Christ later because later may not be one of the cards you'll get to put down on the table.
[time=3376] Here are two terminal lessons we can learn from these dying men.
[time=3383] Lesson number one is this.
[time=3386] It's never too late to come to Christ.
[time=3390] You may be a college student who said I've already made my decision.
[time=3396] It's not too late to change.
[time=3398] You may be a woman in the middle of life who feels like you've already steered your ship in one direction.
[time=3404] It can change.
[time=3406] You may be a senior citizen, still spry, but feeling your years are behind you, you can still come to Christ.
[time=3415] The second lesson we need to learn is you can never presume for a moment that you will come to Christ later because you may not have a different heart than you do now.
[time=3444] We've been sharing with you today the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir and orchestra and special music by Tim Teder and Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=3453] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3456] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3464] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3471] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3474] I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and make my heart clean.
[time=3480] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3484] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3488] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3497] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the study booklet entitled "How in the World Is It Going to End", please write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=3512] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1420 or use the sermon title "Dying Men Who Made Desperate Decisions".
[time=3522] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3528] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3539] Perhaps you have thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3543] Why not do it today?
[time=3545] I know it would be an encouragement to pass to Rick and the entire Bible Hour staff.
