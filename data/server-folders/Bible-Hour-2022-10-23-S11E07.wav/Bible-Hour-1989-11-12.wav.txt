[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] Why is it that you can tell a man that there are five hundred and eighty-one billion stars throughout the universe, but if you tell him that wall is wet, he has to touch the paint to see for himself.
[time=84] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Oax. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled, "A Skeptic Who Is Satisfied."
[time=105] Thomas is famous for being a doubter. He was a man who insisted on seeing for himself.
[time=111] Perhaps you are a doubting Thomas. You find it difficult to take someone else's word for it. You have an insatiable desire to test to see if the paint is really wet.
[time=121] Being a doubter is not all bad. In fact, the Bible encourages a level of healthy skepticism stating, "Believe not everyone who claims to hold a religious truth."
[time=131] Yet skepticism can lead to cynicism. It may become a matter of refusing to believe. The life of Thomas teaches us some valuable lessons on dealing with doubt.
[time=142] Today's message is entitled, "A Skeptic Who Is Satisfied." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us. Please have them open to the Book of John.
[time=153] We will be looking at chapter 20, verses 24 through 29. Our special music today includes a solo from Denise Mitchell
[time=164] and a number from the Handbelt Choir. We now join our service as the Sanctuary Choir brings us a number entitled, "Our God Rains."
[time=183] [MUSIC - 666 seconds]
[time=859] Welcome again to the Bible Hour. We hope that the first part of our church service has already captured your heart and pointed it towards Christ. Pete, that was an exciting concert that we had just this past week with Diane Bish.
[time=872] Diane Bish is an outstanding organist, Rick, and we were really privileged to have her play our new organ here, and she's from Florida, came up and just gave us an outstanding concert, and I'm delighted at the people that were here.
[time=883] Even though that event has already passed, we just wanted to remind you that we have a variety of great ministries, concerts in particular, that we share with you, and if you don't come, you really miss out on something. And this organ concert was a great night.
[time=898] Yes, Rick, we really try to have a lot of variety in our program so that if that's not your particular style, not to come anyway and enjoy it, and yet the next time perhaps we'll have something that satisfies you just a little bit more.
[time=910] Well, so far this fall, we've had a harmonica concert and a classical organ concert and quite a bit in between there.
[time=916] That's right. We have the living Christmas tree coming up in just a few days. We couldn't be more excited. Lots of work yet to be done, and the ticket distribution began yesterday. How did that go?
[time=929] Well, we had a host of people here. I suppose we served over 600 people that came in four tickets, and we had a good group of volunteers that helped and disseminated the tickets very rapidly, and that worked out really well. There are a few left, however, Rick.
[time=946] When can people get their hands on tickets? If they're watching now and say, "I'd like to come to the living Christmas tree," how can they get the tickets?
[time=955] Well, we have a living Christmas tree office, and you can call that office to see what's available between the hours of 9 and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
[time=964] And that number, if you have a pencil handy, is 493-7400. Ask for the living Christmas tree ticket office, and they'll explain to you what's available and what concerts are still open.
[time=976] Well, we hope that each of you can come to the living Christmas tree. It's our opportunity, first and foremost, to elevate and exalt praise the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=987] It's also an opportunity for us to share with this community who Jesus Christ is. We'd want you to come. So if you'd like tickets, we encourage you to call.
[time=997] Remember to call Monday through Friday. We do not have people here on Sunday or on Saturday any of the weekend days, but during the week, give them the number one more time, please.
[time=1007] You can call 493-7400, and that's the living Christmas tree ticket office.
[time=1014] We do want to encourage you to write to us here at the Bible Hour. Each week we have a booklet to share with you. Today we have this booklet titled "How in the World Is It Going to End?"
[time=1025] One of the most fascinating but also difficult studies of the Bible are the studies that take us through books like Revelation, where it talks about the end times, how God's going to bring all of history to a culmination.
[time=1038] You've probably heard terms like rapture, second coming, tribulation, millennial, final season, Armageddon, but probably don't have a real clear idea of what those terms mean.
[time=1049] One of our booklets, "How in the World Is It Going to End?" We try to give you an overview of what the Bible teaches about those events.
[time=1057] What will happen during the seven-year tribulation? Who will be in the millennium? What will happen to me if I'm a believer in Christ and I die?
[time=1065] Well, I go through the tribulation if Christ should come in the next few years. The answers to these questions are nestled clearly in the pages of this booklet, "How in the World Is It Going to End?"
[time=1077] And if you would write to us, we'd be glad to send you a copy.
[time=1081] We encourage you to write today to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1101] Thank you, Pete, and remember for tickets to call Monday through Friday and for the booklet right to us here at the Bible hour. Thanks for being a part of this hour together today.
[time=1131] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=1221] Our God and Father, the prayer of our heart today, is what we've heard run through a bell. Be thou my vision. Father, we would ask you today in these moments of study to give us insight, to give us vision, to give us understanding, that our lives, though busy, that are still empty, might be filled.
[time=1249] That our hearts, though, filled with everything, are still longing for something. God be thou our vision. We pray that you'll give to that businessman who is climbing the ladder two runs at a time, the insight to know that there is no ladder that can lead to eternal life except for Jesus Christ.
[time=1271] We pray that you would be the vision of a senior adult who has calculated their earnings and their net worth and has figured out how they can retire, how they'll be able to live, to know that life consists more than in abundance, what a man possesses.
[time=1289] We pray you'd be the vision of a student today that is wrestling with academic issues. Skepticism is a part of everyday life to know that there's certainty in Jesus Christ.
[time=1302] We pray for those who are going through the valley of the shadow of death, that you would be to them a vision of comfort and strength, that a Psalm like David's 23rd Psalm would be a way of life that they would know you walk with them.
[time=1318] We pray today that you would encourage the hearts of those who are facing life's toughest issues. For those who have parted with loved ones, many unexpectedly, we ask you to comfort them.
[time=1333] We ask you to put your hand upon Jim and Kami Wharton's little baby. We pray that you'll bring baby Riley back from emergency surgery, that you'll restore that young life.
[time=1346] We pray that you'll comfort a mother and father. We ask you to guide the hands of surgeons that will operate on Dottie Roadenbach and Ron Hackett.
[time=1357] We pray that you would work through medicine, the laws of nature that you've created to bring about full recovery.
[time=1365] We pray for Dolores Bryant that you would help her body to be restored from the influence of surgery, may it grow back stronger and healthier.
[time=1377] We pray for men today who have lost their jobs, either permanently or indefinitely, that they wouldn't lose their dignity or their sense of self-worth.
[time=1387] We ask you to support them emotionally and provide for them materially. We pray for marriages that have hit hard times, that you would help each one to look not on what the other person could have done for me.
[time=1402] But what is it that God would have me to be? Give us a vision as a husband, as a father, as a wife, as a mother.
[time=1412] Father, those of us who come here today with doubts, we ask you to give assurance. Those that come with skeptical and inquisitive minds to give answers, and in every case to put Jesus Christ forth, for it's in His name that we pray, amen.
[time=1431] Born in each of us is a natural disposition towards doubt, or a strand of skepticism at best.
[time=1441] Why is it that you can tell the average American that there are 581 billion, 732 million, 958,431 stars in the sky, and he believes you?
[time=1455] And if you tell him that has wet paint on it, he has to touch it to see for himself.
[time=1462] There's something about each of us that is doubtful, skeptical, inquisitive. Such was the case with the famous Thomas, one of Jesus' disciples.
[time=1474] Allow me to read to you his doubting words as they're recorded by John in John 2024 through 29.
[time=1486] In the verses prior to verse 24, Jesus has appeared alive after His crucifixion. The resurrected Christ was seen by not 12, but only 10 of the disciples.
[time=1500] Thomas was absent, and Judas had died. Now verse 24. Now Thomas, called Didymus, one of the 12, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
[time=1514] So the other's disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, and put my finger where the nails were,
[time=1529] and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
[time=1539] A week later, his disciples were in the house again. Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them, and he said, "Peace be with you."
[time=1555] Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here. See my hands. Reach your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."
[time=1570] Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God." Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe."
[time=1590] Doubt can be sharply divided in two categories. One questions of the mind, the other objections of the will.
[time=1601] The former says, "Give me some facts so that I can believe." The latter says, "Don't confuse me with the facts. I don't want to believe."
[time=1620] They saw Jesus. I'm sick of hearing about it. They, Peter, John, and his brother are always trying to say they know more than the rest of us.
[time=1637] So what if Jesus took just the three of them up into the mountain several times?
[time=1643] Perhaps he thought they needed more teaching than the rest of us. Maybe he wanted to correct them and wanted to do it privately.
[time=1651] I remember a time the three of them came down from the mountain and said they saw Moses and Elijah.
[time=1658] I wouldn't know Moses and Elijah, and I don't know what they saw, and neither do they. I wouldn't recognize Moses and Elijah if they came and knocked on the door, and they wouldn't either.
[time=1672] Now they say they've seen Jesus. Well, I saw him too. I saw Jesus arrested. I saw him humiliated, and I saw him dead.
[time=1690] But that's all I saw, and that's all they saw too. We've been cooped up in this little attic for so long. We're all starting to see things.
[time=1699] And John, somehow John can fit into every conversation that he was the first to reach the empty tomb, that he beat Peter.
[time=1709] Well, beating Peter is hardly an accomplishment unless it's a race to put your foot in your mouth.
[time=1715] I enjoyed the day Jesus stared him down and said, "Thou art Satan."
[time=1721] We didn't have to put up with his usual yacking for an entire day, but it soon returned to normal. Look at him over there, bossing everyone around.
[time=1729] We're going to do this. We're going to do that. We're not going to do anything other than what we've done all week. Nothing.
[time=1739] Brave Peter has seen Jesus. Is that why we've stayed up, cooped up in this little attic for seven days with the door locked and the curtains drawn?
[time=1748] And still, Peter bosses everyone around. He's trying to make something out of that "Thou art Peter" business.
[time=1757] I enjoy calling him Simon. Just to remind him, he is no rock. And if he is, then why doesn't Rocky go out and buy us our food? Why does Rocky keep sending the women out?
[time=1769] I'll tell you why, because he is afraid. He's afraid that if he goes out, he'll be recognized again. He's afraid if he goes out and he's recognized he'll wimp out once again and deny he ever knew Jesus.
[time=1784] He's afraid. But if Jesus really were alive, why did he come when I was gone? Why wasn't I there?
[time=1801] If he is God and he knows everything, why didn't he know I had just gone to the temple? Why didn't he include me?
[time=1810] No. No, I will not believe. I will not believe until I see him, until I can touch his hands, until I can touch his side, until I am there.
[time=1827] Mr. Thompson, line two, Mr. Thompson, phone call on line two.
[time=1840] Yeah, Thompson here. What do you want? Oh, hi, honey.
[time=1846] No, not tonight. No, it's just been too rough of a day here. Yeah, I just, I can't make it tonight. Maybe next week, okay? Listen, how do you find out about all these church services anyway?
[time=1860] Oh, she's over there and she told you. Well, I can't make it. No, not tonight. But maybe next week, I promise, okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[time=1872] Listen, I got to go. Next week, next week, okay? Okay, bye. Yeah. Next week, if it snows in July, I knew I shouldn't have started going to church.
[time=1888] First, she gets us into the PTA. Then she's got us serving on the social committee at the club. And now she wants us to go to church all the time.
[time=1898] Like it was a religion or something. I tell you, if I get one more card in the mail with those little dogs on the front looking so sad and you open it up and it says, we miss you, won't you come back and visit us?
[time=1912] Or if I get one more knock on our door from those people from the church, I'll, I'll shut that card down and throw to that smiling happy jack that comes seize us every Wednesday night.
[time=1927] And what does she get off embarrassing me in front of my boss? Talking about religion and God and all that? Geez, doesn't she know that step belongs at home or in church?
[time=1938] Definitely not here in the office. What am I going to do? What am I going to do?
[time=1948] Hey, what's this? This looks like something pretty good. Hey, yeah. Yeah. Evolution. Yeah, I'll whip this stuff on her. She can't handle that stuff.
[time=1965] Man, this is good stuff. I'll whip this on her in there. And those little intellectual midgets that are going to come visit us tonight. Yeah, let's just shut her up.
[time=1979] Doubt can be divided into two categories, questions of the mind, the individual who says, I need more information so that I can believe, and objections of the will.
[time=1991] Don't confuse me with the information. I don't want to believe.
[time=1996] As we look at the life of Thomas, as John tells us in John chapter 20, Thomas brings to our attention three different chords that have to be braided together to have genuine faith.
[time=2009] The first chord we've seen by Thomas and Tom Thompson. It is the chord of a willful choice. Faith requires a willful choice.
[time=2022] If you look at what Thomas said, he said, until I see, until I feel, until I touch, I will not believe it. Notice the tense there. I will not believe it.
[time=2037] It's not, I cannot believe it, or I want to believe it, but I need more facts. It's not a statement of the mind. It's a statement of the will.
[time=2046] It's a man saying, I don't want to believe. If anybody had reason to believe, Thomas was a candidate.
[time=2056] You see, Thomas had been an eyewitness of three other resurrections. Jesus raised Joris' daughter from the dead. He raised the widow's son from the dead.
[time=2069] And then with a full audience in Bethany, he raised Lazarus from the dead. And Thomas had seen that Jesus had the power to raise the dead.
[time=2080] Not only did he know it from experience, but Jesus had told them, I'm going to go to Jerusalem. I'm going to suffer many things at the hands of the chief priests and the elders.
[time=2091] I am going to be crucified, and I am going to rise again on the third day. Yet with all of this experience and all of this teaching, Thomas has a problem.
[time=2106] That's a problem of the will. It's not that he can't believe, it's that he won't believe.
[time=2114] In English grammar, there is a no-no. You don't use two double negatives. You only use one negative.
[time=2122] But in the language of the New Testament, Koine Greek, it's admissible to use two negatives. And that's exactly how John records it here.
[time=2132] Thomas's words literally would be translated like this. I will know, know, believe. Or I will not, not believe. The emphasis might be, I will never, ever believe.
[time=2148] He was emphatic. It wasn't a question of the mind. It was an objection of the will.
[time=2156] Many of us have been in that same situation. Maybe you're in it today spiritually. Maybe you came to church is what one of my friends who's a counselor calls a draggy.
[time=2166] A draggy is somebody who came to church because their husband or their wife or their mother or their father, drug them to church.
[time=2173] Heals dug in with scrapemarks straight down the sidewalk. You may be a draggy today. And you've said, I'm not going to believe.
[time=2182] Whatever that church wants me to do, I'm going to do the opposite. It's not a question of is it right or wrong, is it true or is it false?
[time=2191] Those are intellectual questions. Yours is a question of the heart, of the will. That's what Thomas struggled with here.
[time=2198] Whenever we're being influenced, contrary to our will, we either find fault with the presenter or the presentation.
[time=2206] I remember a number of years ago, we lived just about a half a mile east of church.
[time=2211] We had some very exciting water. You could turn on the spigot and you had to guess at what color it would be today.
[time=2218] What may come plopping out along with H2O? It was bad.
[time=2223] We had just gotten our coats on, reached for the door to open it when the door bell rang.
[time=2229] I pulled the door open and here was a sales lady, brochure in hand.
[time=2233] Hi, I'm from the handy dandy water softener company, and we know that you have really bad water here.
[time=2239] I said, we really do have bad water here, but we were just on our way out and we're already running late, can you come back?
[time=2245] And she said, look at our brochure. Drop this multi-page brochure down in front of me and start a description of each of the different units that they have.
[time=2254] I said in a very affirming tone, thank you. We are late. Can you come back another time?
[time=2261] She said, not only do we have all these models, but we have our own financing plan.
[time=2266] There's nobody who can't afford one of our handy dandy water softeners.
[time=2271] I reiterated that I was late, that I didn't have my coat on because I was cold in my house, that we were leaving, that she was standing between me and the door, and would she please go?
[time=2282] She continued with her spiel, at which time I said, as strong as I could say, no, we're leaving, and we walked around her and pulled the door behind.
[time=2292] In the car, I said to Kathy, I don't care what comes out of that spigot, we're never buying a water softener.
[time=2300] It's human nature.
[time=2304] When we don't like the presenter, we reject the presentation. It's not a matter anymore of whether we need a water softener, or whether that's a good water softener.
[time=2316] It's a matter of me versus you, and you're not going to win and put a water softener in this guy's garage.
[time=2322] I didn't remember going through the same thing spiritually.
[time=2326] I thought life was going pretty good, and then my mother accepted Christ.
[time=2329] Then my sister accepted Christ. Then my breast friends brother accepted Christ.
[time=2334] There were little Bible studies in our house. They were whispering about me as I went up the stairs.
[time=2339] Is that the one we're praying for?
[time=2343] My breast friend and I went upstairs and said, they can pray all they want. We're not believing.
[time=2348] It wasn't a question of the mind. It was an objection of the will.
[time=2355] If you can't find fault with the one doing the presenting, then we try to find fault with the presentation itself.
[time=2363] We try to raise smoke screens. They may be a nice person and they may have a point about religion and maybe they need religion, but this is some stuff they can't handle.
[time=2376] We'll bring up some philosophical issues. If God's good, then why does a God good allow evil to exist in our world?
[time=2384] If they can answer that one, then I'll come up with objection number two, but that ought to hold them all for today.
[time=2391] Find a problem with the presentation.
[time=2394] Is there an unanswerable question that we can pose so that if they can't answer our question, we don't have to believe in their God.
[time=2405] If you can't fault the presentation or the presenter, you're left with the dilemma that I'm responsible to believe and I don't want to.
[time=2417] If you've come today with unanswerable questions, I know that I'm not bright enough to answer them.
[time=2423] But I hope you're smart enough to know this, that just because one person doesn't have the answer doesn't mean that there isn't one.
[time=2433] The first chord to be braided together in genuine faith is that faith is a willful choice.
[time=2443] I don't want to try to influence one person against their will because a man persuaded against his will is of his own opinion still.
[time=2453] You have to willfully want to search the scriptures and to study them and to see if they are true.
[time=2462] That brings us to the second chord and that is faith is a rational choice.
[time=2469] It's not only a willful choice, but it's a rational choice.
[time=2473] Faith in Jesus Christ is not incompatible with knowledge.
[time=2479] You don't have to commit intellectual suicide to become a believer in Jesus Christ.
[time=2487] Dr. Richard Mann, a psychiatrist here in the community, medical director of Flint and View Behavioral Center.
[time=2496] I was raised and taught much with regard to the body and the mind.
[time=2502] I also was raised and taught intellectually about our God as a triune God, a Trinity.
[time=2510] It was not until later after I accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior that I understood that being created in God's image was a Trinity within myself
[time=2520] and that Jesus Christ was that third part of that Trinity.
[time=2525] I had been successful professionally until that time.
[time=2528] I had a good marriage, but it was at that time that I was complete and I understood what completeness was.
[time=2539] Good morning. I'm Dr. Jim Heckman and I'm a neurologist.
[time=2544] Leaving God always came very naturally to me, but I had some trouble trying to fit in Christ into the scheme of things.
[time=2552] A few years ago I was challenged to really weigh the facts and I did that.
[time=2556] I looked at the history and scientific evidence and it really becomes inescapable that Christ is the Son of the God and the only salvation for us.
[time=2570] For years, whenever I would hear an altar call, my chest would get tight and my heart would pound.
[time=2579] And then I tried to avoid such situations.
[time=2583] Then a friend, the next my wife, accepted Christ as their Savior.
[time=2588] So last year during the living Christmas tree, I too made that personal commitment to Christ.
[time=2594] I am so thankful that Christ was patient with me and kept bringing people into my life to challenge me to have a Christ center life.
[time=2604] Good morning. My name is Mary Perigenian. I own and operate a mortgage company.
[time=2613] And for me, there were years of my life when I was running through life, searching for happiness with financial success and feel goods in my life.
[time=2623] Until alcohol finally had its way with me and I was living a totally soft, reliant life.
[time=2631] Today I believe that man's extremities are God's opportunity.
[time=2638] And I think when the pain got so intense that my belief became that there was reliance and not defiance that was important in my life.
[time=2647] And through the 13 years of my journey of sobriety, there are many people that I've come to love.
[time=2656] I found Jesus Christ. And it was only seven months ago that I accepted Jesus Christ as my very own personal Savior.
[time=2665] I guess what I'd like to leave you with today for me is that I found the sheep, and through the sheep, I then found the shepherd. Thank you.
[time=2676] Faith in Jesus Christ is a rational choice of thinking, of weighing the evidence, and reaching a conclusion.
[time=2690] And faith in Jesus Christ is absolutely credible and compatible with all that we know scientifically and intellectually.
[time=2703] Thomas raises the question of is it rational? Is there evidence? He puts it bluntly.
[time=2711] He says I'm not going to believe this irrational notion of a resurrection until I have empirical evidence, until I, by sight observation, can see.
[time=2722] And until I, by hand touch, can feel I will not believe.
[time=2731] Evidence was demanded and evidence was delivered. Jesus gave him three pieces of evidence, three different miraculous things to contemplate.
[time=2743] The first thing that Jesus did is he appeared in a miraculous way. The disciples were locked in an upper room, an attic at best.
[time=2753] The door was locked for fear of the Jews. And Jesus miraculously appeared.
[time=2760] How did he get there? How did he come through that locked door? How did he go through a wall?
[time=2767] That got Thomas' attention, first of all. But there was a second miraculous revelation. Jesus answered Thomas' demand word for word.
[time=2781] It had been a week. Jesus wasn't there when Thomas said, "Unless I see his hand, let's I touch the nail scars, unless I put my hand in his wounded side."
[time=2792] Jesus wasn't there. Nobody had told Jesus, and now Christ stands in front of Thomas and says, "See, touch, feel."
[time=2807] Jesus demonstrated supernatural knowledge. But the third piece of evidence was the obvious and overwhelming.
[time=2815] It was that Jesus Christ was dead, and now he was alive.
[time=2824] There was evidence that was demanded, and there was evidence that was delivered.
[time=2830] And Thomas became instantly a devoted, life-long believer. It's tragic that we think of him as doubting Thomas.
[time=2838] He went through seven days of doubts, and he went through a lifetime of belief, but we call him doubting Thomas.
[time=2846] Thomas was so convinced that his immediate declaration was both simple and profound. He said, "My Lord and my God."
[time=2857] Many of us raised an objection at this point and say, "Hey, if I was Thomas, I'd believe too." I mean, if I was there, and if I saw, and if I touch, and if I felt, then of course I'd believe, but that was 1900 years ago.
[time=2872] Jesus anticipated that problem. And he addressed it in his very next words to Thomas. He said, "Thomas, good. You've done well.
[time=2881] But you believe because you have seen, blessed are those who believe and have not seen."
[time=2891] The insight that I'd like to bring is this, that Jesus Christ expects us to believe just as he expected Thomas to believe, though Thomas saw, and we have only heard second hand.
[time=2903] But God supplies us with evidence to believe. He supplies us with the evidence to believe of his Holy Spirit.
[time=2912] Christ said that when he left, he would send the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit would do these things, that he would convict of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[time=2924] What that means in everyday language is simple. It is this, that Jesus, though he is in heaven, the Spirit of God is still working around the world.
[time=2935] And he's the one that speaks to the inner person and makes the inner person here and understand and believe that they're in need of a Savior, that they're a sinner, that they need Christ.
[time=2951] It is the Spirit of God that convicts a person, that though they're a sinner, Christ was not that he was righteousness, and that is God's standard.
[time=2960] And it's the Spirit of God that convicts us, makes us the known to believe on the inside that apart from Christ we stand under God's judgment.
[time=2968] Ron could not have expressed it better when he talked about sitting in a church service, hearing an appeal to accept Christ, and his own heart would convict him.
[time=2978] It wasn't the words of a song, it wasn't the poetry of a speaker, it was the Spirit of God that made his word come alive.
[time=2986] And you know, usually there is a direct proportion between the amount of conviction of the Holy Spirit and the amount of resistance we muster.
[time=2995] And I don't get discouraged when somebody is adamant that they don't want to believe.
[time=3001] That's just a good sign that God's Spirit's already begun, the work of convicting.
[time=3006] God has a second witness, it's the witness of people.
[time=3010] Mary couldn't have stated it better when she said, first she came to know the sheep, and through the sheep she came to know the shepherd.
[time=3018] That's why God has all of us who know Christ here, to be a witness to those who haven't.
[time=3023] And then God has a third witness, it's the witness of his word.
[time=3028] This is a point where people often raise the objection.
[time=3031] That's my point, Hawks.
[time=3033] I can't believe the Bible. I can't base my faith on what men wrote.
[time=3041] It was just their philosophy, not true.
[time=3045] The Bible says that it's not the philosophy of men, but it's the word of God and that he supernaturally oversaw every word that they wrote.
[time=3053] Every eye that they dotted and every tee that they crossed.
[time=3058] People say, wait a minute, and they begin to object to the historicity of the Bible.
[time=3064] They're saying, here are the two problems I hear most of the time.
[time=3067] I can't believe the Bible when it says that there was a guy by the name of Noah who built himself a boat and the entire world was flooded.
[time=3078] Second objection is usually, and I can't believe that fishtail, you know, Jonah in the whale, you're asking me to swallow too much.
[time=3087] Let's talk about those just in a brief way.
[time=3092] I went to a secular high school and graduated from a secular university.
[time=3097] In my classes in science, I was taught that there was an ice age, an age when the entire globe was covered by ice that is presented as scientific fact.
[time=3111] And I accepted it then, and I accept it now.
[time=3116] But that only stands to confirm the biblical record.
[time=3119] For there to be an ice age, one only needs to ask the question, where did the water come from to form the ice?
[time=3128] And I want to suggest to you that Henry Morris and John would come in their account of the Genesis flood and explained it perfectly.
[time=3135] That God had a universe with an earth and an earth that was protected by a vapor canopy that shielded out the ultraviolet rays of the sun and allowed for the longevity that we see in lives of people in Genesis.
[time=3149] And that the world-flied flood was the collapse of that canopy.
[time=3154] And when that canopy collapsed, seasons began to occur, the water of the flood began to freeze, and ice covered the world, and we now call it scientifically the ice age.
[time=3165] And the Bible and science are not at odds, they complement, and they're compatible.
[time=3172] Jonah and the whale. Now there's a fish story.
[time=3178] It seems impossible that Jonah was swallowed by a whale, stayed three days in the belly of the fish, the fish got nauseated, regurgitated Jonah out, and here is a man still alive.
[time=3195] Christians have often demonstrated their faith in Christ, but not their soundness and thinking by saying, "I just believe the Bible." If the Bible says that Jonah swallowed the whale, I'd believe that too.
[time=3208] That's nice that you have great faith, and that doesn't answer them question.
[time=3213] Could a man literally be swallowed by a whale and live?
[time=3217] Here's this account that has been covered by a number of sources, including a skeptical article in an article by Princeton Theological Seminary in the year 1917.
[time=3229] It tells the story of a ship by the name of the Star of the East, which set sail off the coast of Argentina very close to the Falkland Islands.
[time=3239] It was a whaling ship. They spotted their prime species, a sperm whale. Two boats were released from the mothership. They rode out with their harpoon guns, and the first gun hit a bull's eye, struck the whale broadside, the harpoon sunk in deep.
[time=3256] In the whale's pain and squirming to get away, its huge tail flipped a tidal wave of water onto the second boat, and it was capsized. The crewmen were searched for. All were found but won, a man by the name of James Bartley.
[time=3274] Bartley was given up for dead. The whale was finally conquered and drugged side by side to the mother boat. They trimmed its blubber, stored it in the hall, and then drug the carcass of the whale on board, and the next day they saw the stomach of the whale move.
[time=3297] They cut open the stomach of the whale and pulled from its innards, one James Bartley, still alive. Not in the best shape, but still alive.
[time=3312] That doesn't prove that Jonah was swallowed by a whale, but it does prove one thing. That it is plausible for a man to be swallowed by a whale and live, and the Bible is both credible and compatible with all that we know as rational thinking people.
[time=3331] One of the mistakes that's been made, and we've allowed it to be made, is that Christianity is a leap into the dark. It is not, it is but a step into the light. A leap in the dark saying, "I have no idea what's out there, but I'll just close my eyes and jump."
[time=3347] It's like a little boy when he was asked in Sunday school, "What's faith?" He said, "Faith? That's believing what you know ain't so." That's not what faith is. It's not a leap into the dark. It's a step into the light. It's an individual saying, "Based upon what I know rationally, I will take one more step and receive Christ. Though I can't see him, I've weighed the evidence and I've made my rational choice."
[time=3376] You've never known personally everything. If you go to the doctor for surgery, you could say, "Well, how do I know you're a doctor?" He said, "Well, I have a diploma hanging on my wall. How do I know you don't own a Macintosh PC and a laser printer, and you didn't make that? How do I know that I'll really fall asleep when you give me the sodium pentathol? How do I know that I'll really wake up?
[time=3400] How do I know that you'll know the difference between a gallbladder and a kidney when you get inside there? How do I know that your stitches will hold? How do you know that I'll wake up from the sodium pentathol? How do I know there'll be a nurse there for me in recovery? How do I know the pain medication will work? How do I know I won't become addicted from it?"
[time=3419] You can't know any of those things. All you can know is what you investigate that he's a good doctor, that he's been successful in surgery, that the procedure has helped others, and then you take the step of faith to trust him. It's still a step of faith, but it's not a leap into the dark, it's a step into the light. Faith in Jesus Christ is the same.
[time=3441] The third chord that must be braided together to give us genuine faith is personal choice.
[time=3450] Underline these words in your mind. Thomas said to Jesus, "My Lord and my God, underline the Word, my. We must personally receive Christ."
[time=3471] We are always encouraged when you join us for the Bible Hour. Today, you heard special music from our Sanctuary Choir, soloist Denise Mitchell, and our Handbell Choir.
[time=3490] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks. If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3500] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins, and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3511] I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3521] If you prayed that prayer, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance," to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
