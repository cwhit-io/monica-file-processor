[time=50] (dramatic music)
[time=61] - Welcome to an hour of Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=67] Thank you for joining us.
[time=69] Rick's message today is entitled "A Woman Who Has Been Around, Comes Around." Marriage and divorce.
[time=76] Marriage and divorce.
[time=77] It has become a cycle of life today.
[time=80] After the paperwork is done and a settlement reached, two people who had vowed to be faithful through thick and thin walked their ways.
[time=88] Each leaves with their share of the assets and their share of the pain.
[time=92] Marriage is too often the union of two people looking for satisfaction for themselves, like two ticks looking for a dog.
[time=100] Today we will meet a woman who had been married five times and was living with a sixth man when she met Jesus.
[time=106] She was a woman who had been around.
[time=109] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=113] Rick's text is taken from the book of John chapter four verses four through 31 and verses 39 through 42.
[time=121] Our special music today will be provided by Lisa Reniker, reflection, and Corrine sycaphus.
[time=128] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir
[time=135] brings us a number entitled, "Sing to the Lord and Be Not Silent."
[time=142] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=345] And what a privilege it is to sing to the Lord
[time=351] and give gratitude to his name for what he's done for us.
[time=354] That's the hope in which we dwell and look forward to the fellowship that we'll have eternally with him when he returns again.
[time=362] And my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=367] Him number 404, please.
[time=369] We'll sing the first, third and fourths, stands us together of 404.
[time=374] [MUSIC - 465 seconds]
[time=846] [APPLAUSE]
[time=851] We are thrilled to have you joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=855] Every day is a great opportunity, but these holidays in particular are exciting events, particularly with the coming of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=864] Rick, it's a very important time in the life of our church, especially for our own people as they invite their friends to come for this unique concert featuring the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=874] And I have mixed emotions about the tickets. They're all gone already, and there's quite a long waiting list.
[time=881] Well, we wish we could say to each of you a call and we'll have tickets for you, but somewhere close to 20,000 tickets have already been distributed, and we can't even take your name on a waiting list because that would be just misleading you. The list is already too long.
[time=897] We do have one opportunity to share with you, and that is a benefit concert, which is a premier concert and dinner of the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=905] It is an opportunity to support Christian education, Black Hawk Christian School, and attend the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=912] If you would like information on the benefit concert for the cost and all of the details, if you'll simply call our school office, we'll be glad to give that information to you.
[time=922] You'll need to call the school office Monday through Friday between 8 and 5, and the phone number is 4937400.
[time=932] Once again, that phone number is for information about the benefit concert for its cost and details. The number is 4937400.
[time=942] Pete, you've been busy recording the Living Christmas Tree for a cassette that's going to be available.
[time=948] We really need to have the music prepared quite well in advance because we have recorded the music this year in preparation for a cassette that will be made of almost all of the music that you'll hear that night.
[time=959] We did this last week, and the tape is off to Kentucky, and they will duplicate it, and hopefully we'll have it here for that first concert so that it will be available for people that would like to take it to their homes and listen to it through the holiday season.
[time=972] Well, for you friends who are coming to the concerts, there'll be an opportunity to buy the music then and have it on cassette, and if you're not able to come to the concerts because of your schedule or a lack of a ticket, when December comes, we'll be able to share it with you by way of cassette.
[time=987] Pete, it's hard to believe, but one week from today, the Living Christmas Tree actually goes up.
[time=992] We have a lot of committees meeting in the next few days, so all of the materials, building materials are here in the back room, and ladies are preparing the decorations, so it's an exciting time, in a very busy time for the next couple of weeks.
[time=1006] Well, we certainly hope many of you will be there, and we'll look forward to meeting you.
[time=1010] We do have a booklet that we want to share with you today. It's the second in the series of books that we've authored here at Blackhawk.
[time=1017] The book is titled "How in the World Is It Going to End?" This book is a biblical study of prophecy. We are covering some events and some personalities.
[time=1028] We talk about the Antichrist, what he'll be like, where he'll come from, what will be his personality traits.
[time=1034] We talk about the kingdom when Christ returns, and actually for 1,000 years establishes his kingdom on earth.
[time=1042] We talk about the rapture when Jesus comes for Christians and takes us to heaven.
[time=1046] We talk about that terrible seven-year period called "The Great Tribulation." And throughout the book we have a series of charts that help you to put all of these future events into a proper sequence on a timeline.
[time=1059] When is the rapture? When is the tribulation? When does Christ return? When is his kingdom?
[time=1064] We'd love to send you a copy if you'll simply write to us.
[time=1067] We want to encourage you to write today to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1079] Once again that addresses the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1088] We do hope that you'll write and will send you one of these booklets so that you can study how God's plan for the ages will unfold.
[time=1096] As this year comes to an end we have a lot of special activities besides the living Christmas tree.
[time=1103] On Christmas Eve we'll be having a service here at Blackhawk that will be a time of communion.
[time=1108] We'll have a candlelight service where we together rejoice that Jesus Christ, the light of the world, has come.
[time=1115] And as a part of that candlelight service we have a cantata.
[time=1118] We have a group of 40 people, Rick, that will be singing a cantata entitled "First Light" written by Tom Fedke.
[time=1125] It's a new cantata for this year. I really enjoy that night.
[time=1131] Just before some people of our congregation open presents or anticipate the next day, this is a great time to bring your family.
[time=1139] Just listen to the music and enjoy a very worshipful evening.
[time=1143] I'm looking forward to those opportunities of the holiday when hearts are a little bit more sensitive to the things of Christ.
[time=1150] On the Wednesday between Christmas and New Years we have a film entitled "Caught".
[time=1156] It's been produced by Billy Graham and over the years we've had a number of their outstanding films here.
[time=1162] Each time I'm impressed not only with the message but with the quality of the film production.
[time=1167] But most of all I'm impressed with how many lives are touched and changed by the ministry of a high quality Christian film.
[time=1176] As you're going through the holidays and looking for opportunities, save December the 27th a Wednesday night at 7 o'clock for an evening service with us.
[time=1185] And then on New Years Eve we'll have church with a special guest.
[time=1188] Yes for a number of years Rick we've had a young lady named Lana Young. She was just barely a teenager I think when we first had her here from Michigan.
[time=1197] Now she's around 18 years old and she has a beautiful voice and really loves the Lord.
[time=1202] We've had her here a number of times, it's been a couple years since she's been here and she's going to be with us all day December 31st.
[time=1209] Well we're looking forward to our morning service with Lana Young on December 31st and then a concert in the evening at 6 o'clock.
[time=1216] We hope you'll take your calendar out and put a red letter date on those coming events.
[time=1221] Again we want to thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1246] [MUSIC]
[time=1256] Nobody saw, nobody noticed just how it started.
[time=1269] Boons that were silent were less than the world tore me apart and nobody saw how I died.
[time=1289] Died inch by inch on the inside, burnt by dirt.
[time=1302] The painful memories waited in fire, burnt by dirt.
[time=1316] My filled the wall, one heard at a try.
[time=1324] [MUSIC]
[time=1330] Chantless wind draws, the moonless morning.
[time=1338] After the darkness, without warning, the broke right through.
[time=1351] Invading my heart, you are turned by her through my past.
[time=1362] And you melted the barriers at last.
[time=1370] The painful memories waited in light, burnt by dirt.
[time=1390] You healed them all, one heard at a try.
[time=1397] My friends, your name, and I'm so glad you came.
[time=1410] Oh Jesus, where would I be without you?
[time=1420] You knew, you knew, and just by dirt.
[time=1431] The painful memories waited in light, burnt by dirt.
[time=1444] You healed them all, one heard at a try.
[time=1451] You heard by dirt.
[time=1458] The painful memories waited in light, burnt by dirt.
[time=1471] You healed them all, one heard at a try.
[time=1491] You heard by dirt.
[time=1503] Our Father, there are many here, who the journal of their life is hurt by hurt.
[time=1512] There are those today that have recorded on the walls of their heart, a ledger of disappointment, sorrow of hurt.
[time=1526] And only you can erase those ledgers, they seem to be indelibly etched in our minds and in our spirits, the pain of rejection.
[time=1539] Only you God can comfort a woman who gave and received a vow of trust and fidelity, and now knows the hurt of broken and betrayal.
[time=1554] Oh God, would you today give to that woman a sense of worth and of value, even though she feels rejected?
[time=1566] Hurt by hurt.
[time=1569] Oh God, you know the needs of men here today, who have been made to feel so small, so insignificant, so unimportant.
[time=1582] We ask you to give them a worth that goes beyond their job, beyond the make and model of a car that they drive, beyond the letters of credential that follow their name.
[time=1596] Only you can give a man a sense of worth and a value.
[time=1602] Hurt by hurt, the lines build up.
[time=1606] From the heart of those who've lost loved ones, God only you can comfort a family that has lost a daughter.
[time=1613] Only you can comfort a man who has lost his life as a partner.
[time=1617] Only you can cradle the heart of a child that won't have a father at a Thanksgiving table.
[time=1623] Only you today can give peace in the midst of the storm when a mother has gone from the home.
[time=1631] The hurts build up, and we come to you with our cup empty, asking you to fill it.
[time=1640] And now as we study your word, open not only our Bibles, but we open up our hearts to you.
[time=1647] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1652] Hurt by hurt, that describes the story of an unnamed woman in the pages of Scripture, who had gone through the hurt of marriage and divorce, marriage and divorce, marriage and divorce, a total of five times.
[time=1672] We don't know her name, we know she is from Samaria, particularly the city of Saikar. We only know her by the description of where she met Jesus.
[time=1683] She was a woman at the well. In John chapter 4, I'll pick up the narrative in verse 4 as we meet this woman, whose life was a journal and her diary was listed by hurt.
[time=1697] Now he, Jesus, had gone through Samaria, so he came to a town in Samaria called Saikar, near the plot of ground Jacob, had given to his son Joseph.
[time=1710] Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
[time=1721] When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?" His disciples had gone into town to buy food.
[time=1732] The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?"
[time=1741] For the Jews do not associate with the Samaritans. Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it was that asked you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
[time=1758] "Sir, sir," said the woman, "You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?"
[time=1771] "Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us this well, and drank from it himself, as did his sons, and his flocks, and his herds?"
[time=1781] Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks this water that I give him will never thirst.
[time=1793] Indeed, the water I give him will become in him, a spring of water, welling up to eternal life."
[time=1800] The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."
[time=1810] He said to her, "Go call your husband and come back."
[time=1817] "I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband."
[time=1838] "What you have said is quite true."
[time=1844] "Sir," said the woman, "I see that you are a prophet. Our father's worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
[time=1862] Jesus declared, "Believe me woman, a time is coming when we will worship the father, neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem."
[time=1871] You Samaritans worship what you do not know. We worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.
[time=1878] Yet a time is coming and now has come when true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth.
[time=1886] For they are the kind of worshipers the father seeks. God is spirit and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.
[time=1898] The woman said, "I know that Messiah called Christ is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything."
[time=1915] Like the woman at the well, I was seeking, for things that could not satisfy.
[time=1937] And then I heard my Savior speaking, draw from my well, that never shall run dry.
[time=1953] Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord, come and quench this thirsting of my soul, bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more.
[time=1982] Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.
[time=1993] There are millions in this world who are craving the pleasures earthly things afford.
[time=2008] But none can match the wondrous treasure that I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.
[time=2024] So my brother, if the things this world gave you, leave hungers that won't pass away.
[time=2040] My blessed Lord will come and save you if you kneel to Him and humbly pray.
[time=2057] Fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord, come and quench this thirsting of my soul, bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more.
[time=2086] Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole, bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more.
[time=2110] Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.
[time=2125] Each day this woman brought more than an empty, heavy jar to the well, she brought an empty, heavy heart as well.
[time=2135] Her life had been one of hurt upon hurt.
[time=2140] She was born in a small, despised town into the spised land of Samaria.
[time=2145] Her people were rejected by those of the neighboring lands of Galilee to the north in Judea to the south.
[time=2153] They reached Jewish nations, she carried the brand, half-breed.
[time=2159] She was no student of history, but she knew her own national background.
[time=2164] Originally they too were Jewish, but then the Assyrians came down and when the Assyrians conquered their land,
[time=2172] they exported some of the Jewish people and brought others in from all over the world.
[time=2180] Her ancestors had intermarried with these foreigners, and hence they were called by their Jewish neighbors, half-breeds.
[time=2191] They were only half-Jewish and half-gentile.
[time=2197] She also knew that hostility had been built when her ancestors had offered to help rebuild the temple in Jerusalem
[time=2206] after the Babylonians had destroyed it, and the Jews spit at them and said,
[time=2212] "Get out of here, we'll never let you touch our temple."
[time=2218] The Jewish people she had met before refused to speak to her.
[time=2224] She was less than a citizen in her own land.
[time=2229] The Jews wouldn't let them go to Jerusalem, so they built their own temple.
[time=2234] Then the Jews, just a few generations before her birth, had destroyed their temple on Mount Gerza.
[time=2241] The us and them mentality could not have been more pronounced, but her hurts were far more personal than that.
[time=2252] All of her childhood dreams of love and romance, of a husband, a children in a home, were dashed to pieces in divorce.
[time=2263] In hindsight, she looked back and realized that both of them had gotten married too young.
[time=2268] He was immature and so was she.
[time=2271] There was little money, and what they did have was mismanaged.
[time=2275] He seemed far more interested in his friends than his family.
[time=2281] She returned his lack of attentiveness with a cold shoulder to his needs.
[time=2289] They grew further apart, day by day.
[time=2293] Then the awareness that they were soon to be a family with a little child seemed to draw them back together, but it was only temporary.
[time=2301] Once the child was born, and all the gifts stopped coming in, his attention returned to his friends.
[time=2310] He frequently went on long trips in this fishing business of his.
[time=2316] Finally, to no surprise, he came home and announced that he was moving, and that he was not taking her or the baby with him.
[time=2324] He wanted a divorce.
[time=2327] At least he was kind in his irresponsibility.
[time=2330] Whenever friends had been divorced, her husband had accused her of adultery.
[time=2335] No one in the town believed it, but they all treated her as though it was true.
[time=2341] At least her husband had agreed that he would put her away privately.
[time=2346] So she was young, divorced, penniless, and with a child.
[time=2356] She was an easy mark and married on the rebound.
[time=2360] Her story is one of continual co-dependency.
[time=2364] The man that she married was not at all attractive.
[time=2368] He was a little older. He had never married.
[time=2371] He seemed to lack any social skills, but she couldn't be choosy.
[time=2379] Who was going to marry a divorced woman with a child?
[time=2384] She couldn't turn down any takers.
[time=2387] She married him for the security, but the security wasn't there.
[time=2392] He had isolated her even though they were in the same home.
[time=2397] Anytime she spent a dollar, he reminded her that it was his money.
[time=2403] She always called the little boy her son.
[time=2408] He not only isolated her emotionally, but financially as well.
[time=2415] Their life was not one of ups and downs. It was just one of downs.
[time=2421] Then one day, in a fit of anger, he yelled at her, "I divorce you!
[time=2427] I divorce you!" And by saying it and clapping his hands twice, that was all the law required.
[time=2435] And with the clapping of a hand, she was divorced a second time.
[time=2440] Why?
[time=2444] He was angry that her son had made a mess into his house.
[time=2449] And he threw up the fact that she had talked to him in public, and that had embarrassed him.
[time=2456] And now the morning meal was burnt, and he had had enough of her and her son.
[time=2463] And in impulse, she was divorced.
[time=2466] And for a second time, she was penniless.
[time=2469] And for a second time, she had no place to go.
[time=2472] This time, her parents refused her any help.
[time=2475] They said it had to be her fault for a second marriage to have failed.
[time=2481] Where would she go? What would she do?
[time=2486] She seemed to be a woman without options.
[time=2489] She had remembered a man who had made advances to her in the marketplace.
[time=2494] Repeatedly, he had asked her to be his when she was married.
[time=2499] Would he want her now that she was divorced? Having nowhere to go, she went to him, and he took her in.
[time=2507] They lived together, and very shortly thereafter, were married.
[time=2512] He would provide for her, and she would be his pleasure.
[time=2520] It wasn't long into that third marriage that she realized that she was not the only woman he solicited in the marketplace.
[time=2528] There were others before, and there were others now.
[time=2532] She comforted herself to say that at least she had a home for herself and the son that she desperately loved.
[time=2540] And she tolerated it until the day that he brought the other women home.
[time=2545] And he carried on as that sexual escapades in their house with her son there.
[time=2553] The law granted her no privileges, no rights.
[time=2557] She had to plead with him, and finally he agreed to give her what she wanted most, and hated most, a third bill of divorce.
[time=2569] It wasn't so painful this time.
[time=2573] She didn't know whether it was the relief of being away from this tyrant, or whether it was simply that she was a veteran of this war.
[time=2582] Maybe it was the small nest egg she had collected of his money fearing this day would come.
[time=2590] She left his house, able to provide meagerly for herself and her son.
[time=2597] But she knew her funds would not last long, so she was always looking.
[time=2603] She met a man, he was an artist.
[time=2605] Oh, he could do just about anything with his hands, he could sculpt, he could form pottery on the wheel, and he could paint.
[time=2614] He was impulsive and impetuousness.
[time=2618] Wherever he was there was a whirlwind of activity, and she got caught up in the whirlwind of his romance.
[time=2626] They married.
[time=2627] Some days they had all the money they ever needed because his goods were selling.
[time=2632] And other times nothing would sell and they were poor.
[time=2635] He would go through times of deep, deep depression, and he wouldn't talk to her, couldn't paint, couldn't craft.
[time=2647] There were times that he would leave and not come back for days.
[time=2651] But this time she knew something was different.
[time=2654] He had been gone too long and he wasn't depressed when he had left.
[time=2658] The days turned to weeks, the works turned to months.
[time=2663] She had heard from a mutual friend that he had said that he was going to Rome.
[time=2667] He was going to see the capital of this big world and he was going to make a name for himself.
[time=2673] She did receive one letter.
[time=2675] It was from Rome.
[time=2677] He said he would never be back, but he was going on with his life and she should go on with hers.
[time=2684] She took the letter to the elders of the city and they ceremoniously filled out yet a fourth bill of divorce.
[time=2692] And again she was single.
[time=2695] Again she was penniless and again she had a child for whom she could not provide.
[time=2702] She met a man.
[time=2703] He was different in every way, particularly that he was Jewish from Jerusalem.
[time=2710] He had moved into Saikar to set up a business, exporting goods from Jerusalem to Samaria.
[time=2717] Business was not going great for him.
[time=2719] The Samaritans weren't about to admit they needed anything out of Jerusalem.
[time=2724] But more cold than the business arrangement was the social arrangement.
[time=2728] He was desperately lonely.
[time=2730] So was she.
[time=2732] He found only one person in Samaria willing to talk to the Jew, a woman who had been divorced and remarried a total four times.
[time=2742] They needed each other.
[time=2744] They were dependent upon each other.
[time=2746] And it seemed the best of both worlds for them to marry.
[time=2751] And so she did.
[time=2754] The fifth marriage seemed more tranquil than any of the others and offered the most hope.
[time=2760] He often went back to Jerusalem for three days, even a week to two weeks at a time.
[time=2765] Sometimes he said it was for business and other times he said it was for religious observation.
[time=2771] She could understand and was thankful that he provided for her and her son.
[time=2778] But not too long into the marriage.
[time=2781] Suspicion got the better part of her.
[time=2786] There weren't that many religious holidays.
[time=2791] And he wasn't showing enough money for these things to really be business trips.
[time=2797] In the mood of suspicion she began to go through, parchments and papers that he always carefully guarded.
[time=2805] And she kept finding notes, romantic and flavor with the same signature.
[time=2812] It was then that she discovered that two plus two does equal four.
[time=2818] That his trips to Jerusalem were not business, they were not religious.
[time=2822] Those were all facade for a sexual rendezvous.
[time=2829] He was a man who had two lives and two wives.
[time=2833] One in Jerusalem and herself in Saikar.
[time=2839] She reasoned that she could put up with this because she had nowhere to go.
[time=2845] But time had begun to wear on her.
[time=2848] Temptation had crossed her mind.
[time=2850] She wanted the taste of the forbidden fruit of illicit love.
[time=2856] One day he announced that he was going back to Jerusalem.
[time=2859] Business was calling him there, so he said.
[time=2863] He told her he'd be back in seven days.
[time=2868] There was a young man who walked by their house every evening.
[time=2872] She knew it was not necessity that took him past her gate.
[time=2876] Their eyes had exchanged casual glances.
[time=2880] Though they had never spoken words, a glimpse from eye to eye can speak of attraction.
[time=2887] And they had spoken such words through their eyes.
[time=2892] Her husband was gone.
[time=2894] He would be gone for the next six nights.
[time=2898] She purposely was out in the courtyard, purposely without her veil, purposely waiting for him to come by.
[time=2906] And like the predictable moving of the sun, he walked by her courtyard.
[time=2912] She said hello, and then in a moment of impulse invited him in.
[time=2917] He came in.
[time=2919] They talked.
[time=2920] They laughed.
[time=2921] They ate a little.
[time=2922] They drank a little.
[time=2923] And for the first time in years, she felt like somebody genuinely was attracted to her.
[time=2929] For the first time in years, she felt wanted and desirable.
[time=2934] The hours flew by.
[time=2937] And some time before sunset of that night, they entered the world of their own intimate affair.
[time=2943] He'd come back the next five nights.
[time=2946] And each night was filled equally with laughter, filled equally with conversation, and filled equally with intimacy.
[time=2959] With sadness, she told him not to come back.
[time=2961] Her husband would be home the next night.
[time=2964] But she assured him to keep his habit of walking by the courtyard because there would come another business trip for her husband to go to Jerusalem.
[time=2974] They parted with hope of seeing each other again.
[time=2979] She made everything in the house look as normal as possible.
[time=2982] She prepared for her husband's arrival.
[time=2984] She kept checking the window that gave her a view of the road.
[time=2989] Late that evening, just as the sun was going down, she could see the silhouette of a man approaching.
[time=2996] As he came closer, she recognized her husband had come.
[time=3001] He stopped at the gate.
[time=3003] He was talking to one of the neighbors.
[time=3005] Then she noticed a great crowd had gathered.
[time=3010] Her husband, in the fit of anger, threw off his tuning.
[time=3013] He shouted out her name and told her to get to the gate and to bring her son.
[time=3019] Instincts told her what had happened.
[time=3022] She had been observed.
[time=3024] Her rendezvous was no secret.
[time=3026] And now the neighbor had told all.
[time=3029] She quickly grabbed not only her son, but a few prized possessions and headed to the gate.
[time=3034] And again, she heard those words, "I divorce you.
[time=3038] I divorce you." The neighbor had not only told of her escapades, but he had made sure that a crowd had gathered for the final ceremony.
[time=3050] As she led her son away from that house, she heard those whispers.
[time=3058] Can you believe her?
[time=3060] How many husbands is it?
[time=3062] I don't know, I need a score sheet.
[time=3064] She heard the more hostile, talking loudly.
[time=3069] Prostitute, whore, adulterous.
[time=3075] She had grown accustomed to those accusations.
[time=3079] Her ears were deaf and her hard heart protected the inner being.
[time=3085] But what would protect her son?
[time=3088] How could a six-year-old little boy hear his mother called those names and go unaffected?
[time=3096] As she wandered through the crowd, it seemed to open up like a herd of sheep when the dog comes through.
[time=3102] She worked her way to the other end of town not knowing where she was going, hopeless and lost until hand touched her on the shoulder.
[time=3111] It was her young lover.
[time=3114] He took the two of them back to his house and took them in.
[time=3118] No questions were asked, no promises were made and none were expected.
[time=3124] Her daily duties took her to the well.
[time=3127] As she would go to the well in the morning of the cool part of the day, she found that there was too much pain.
[time=3135] She changed her habit to go to the well at noon.
[time=3138] She would rather expose herself to the scorching rays of the sun than the searing glances of the more reputable.
[time=3145] She came when she knew no one else would be there.
[time=3148] But one day, someone else was there.
[time=3151] It was obvious by his dress that he was Jewish.
[time=3157] She moved to the other side of the well, knowing that the two of them had nothing in common.
[time=3165] Much to her surprise, he did something that was both natural and unnatural at the same time.
[time=3171] He asked her for a drink.
[time=3173] It was natural that a man in the desert would be thirsty.
[time=3175] It was very unnatural that a man would talk to a woman, particularly a Jewish man to a Samaritan woman.
[time=3182] Yet he spoke to her.
[time=3185] But what was puzzling is when he said to her, "If you knew who I was," she thought to herself,
[time=3192] "I'm not in the mood for 20 questions with a stranger." And he went on to say, "If you knew who I was, you would ask me for a drink of water, and I would give you living water."
[time=3205] She shook her head.
[time=3207] What's this guy up to?
[time=3209] He's the one with the dry tongue and the parched lips.
[time=3213] I'm the one with the rope and the bucket.
[time=3216] Where's he going to get water? Living water at that.
[time=3222] At first, it didn't make any sense.
[time=3226] Then her mind remembered the teaching of the rabbis.
[time=3229] Something out of the book of Jeremiah that God had said, "My people have committed two sins.
[time=3234] They've turned away from me the source of living water and then have dug out for themselves cisterns that hold no water, broken cisterns."
[time=3244] She had heard the rabbis debate all of this cistern in living water business and decided it wasn't the cisterns that were cracked, it was the rabbis.
[time=3254] And now the stranger brings back the subject of living water.
[time=3259] He made a real sales pitch like she had never heard before.
[time=3263] "Bye for me and you'll be happy." His promise was absurd.
[time=3268] "If you take my water, you'll never be thirsty again." So she said, "I'll call us bluff.
[time=3275] Where can I get this water so that I'll never be thirsty again and I won't have to keep coming back to this well?"
[time=3285] Then the conversation suddenly turned hostile.
[time=3291] When he changed the subject, out of the blue, this man says to her, "Go find your husband and bring him back."
[time=3301] She had been coming to this well in the heat of the day to avoid any confrontation over her marital status.
[time=3309] And now a stranger throws it up in her face.
[time=3316] She tells him both the truth and a lie in the same statement, "I have no husband."
[time=3325] The words were accurate, the intention falls.
[time=3330] She thought that will end the conversation, at least the conversation on this forbidden subject.
[time=3337] Then he said to her, "You have said the truth. You have no husband.
[time=3343] The truth is you've had five husbands and the man with whom you're now living is not your husband."
[time=3352] She was taken back.
[time=3355] How did he know so much?
[time=3357] It was a small town. She knew everybody. She had been through the market place that day and he was not there.
[time=3363] He was a stranger. He had just arrived in the outskirts of the city and plopped himself down on the edge of this well.
[time=3373] She went through every possibility and the only conclusion that she could come up with is that this man must indeed be a prophet.
[time=3383] That's it. He is a prophet and a very annoying prophet at that, she thought.
[time=3391] She had built a thick wall around herself.
[time=3397] And now this stranger had found a crack in her fortress and he was reaching through her wall and touching her where she didn't want to be touched.
[time=3410] A flash of an idea comes to her head. She'll ask him an unanswerable question and that will prove that he doesn't have all the answers and it will get the attention off of herself.
[time=3422] So she points to Mount Gerasim and says, "Some people say we should worship on that mountain and then you Jews think we should worship in Jerusalem."
[time=3433] Answer that one. She knew that rabbis and scholars had argued this one over the centuries and the two of them weren't done.
[time=3442] We've been sharing with you today music from our sanctuary choir, soloist Lisa Renneker and Kareen Sikafus and Reflection.

[time=3454] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3462] Dear Heavenly Father, I am thankful that you sent your Son Jesus Christ to come to this earth and eventually die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3472] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior.
