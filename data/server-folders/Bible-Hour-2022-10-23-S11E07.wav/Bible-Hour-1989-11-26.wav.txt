[time=0] [MUSIC - 166 seconds]
[time=170] - This is us in number entitled Song of Thanksgiving.
[time=174] [MUSIC - 279 seconds]
[time=458] - God hath provided and we are indeed grateful for that
[time=474] and we bless his holy name.
[time=477] Continue to sing a song of thanksgiving as we turn to him number 558.
[time=483] We'll sing a medley of songs there and before we sing, we'll have a reading.
[time=488] I will act as the worship leader and you the people.
[time=490] Join with me number 558 and then sing the verses of the hymns that have the arrow on the left side.
[time=498] God saw all that he made and it was very good.
[time=503] - Do you care for the land and the market?
[time=506] Do you envision the continent?
[time=509] The streams of God are filled with water to ride the people with rain or so you have ordained it.
[time=517] - You crown the year with your bounty and your carts overflow with abundance.
[time=522] The grasslands of the desert overflow.
[time=525] The hills are clothed with gladness.
[time=529] - The meadows are covered with floss.
[time=531] And the valleys are mantled with rain.
[time=534] They shout for you and sing.
[time=537] - He makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for man to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth.
[time=544] How many are your works, O Lord?
[time=547] In wisdom you made them all.
[time=549] The earth is full of your creatures.
[time=553] - Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men, for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with the good hands.
[time=566] - But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice you.
[time=572] What I have found I will make good.
[time=576] Salvation comes from the Lord.

[time=1585] Thank you, Lynn.
[time=1587] Our Father, we just thank you this morning for music that we might thank you and praise you at this Thanksgiving time.
[time=1594] And Lord, we do praise you for all of your blessings and for all that you have done for us and the family here at Blackhawk.
[time=1601] But Lord, we come to you this morning with also great needs.
[time=1605] Many who sit among us today are feeling the pressure of pain in their lives, whether it be physical or mental.
[time=1613] We pray for those that have lost jobs in recent weeks and are suffering the pain of that loss.
[time=1619] How will I support my family?
[time=1621] Maybe running through their head right now.
[time=1623] Father, I just pray for the various physical needs in our church.
[time=1627] Praise you for the delivery of a beautiful baby to John and Lorraine Summer.
[time=1632] Just praise you for that.
[time=1634] We just thank you for the testimony of theirs and for the testimony of some that we visited with yesterday and said that their biggest problem was that they just couldn't get to Blackhawk anymore.
[time=1645] That's what bothered them most about their illness.
[time=1648] So we just come and bring all of these to you right now.
[time=1651] Ask your blessing upon us as we study your words.
[time=1654] Speak through me as I proclaim it to the congregation today in Christ's name.
[time=1659] [AMEN] If you have a Bible with you this morning, I'd like you to turn it to the fourth chapter of the Book of Acts, the fourth chapter of the Book of Acts.
[time=1670] This morning we are going to be studying a message which I have entitled, "Bitter or Better, The Choices Hours."
[time=1679] The choice is for you and I to make.
[time=1686] The year was 1966.
[time=1689] The country was North Vietnam.
[time=1692] The building was called the Hanoi Hilton.
[time=1696] Oh, it wasn't like any type of Hilton that you and I have come across today in America.
[time=1703] The Hanoi Hilton was a dungeon.
[time=1705] It was a prison which was used to house the American flyers who had been shot down over North Vietnam.
[time=1712] The walls were embedded with glass, jagged-edged glass, so that no one could climb up the walls to get in or to get out.
[time=1721] The top of the walls had barred wire all the way across so that no one could come over.
[time=1726] It was a fortress.
[time=1728] It was large, but it was a dungeon.
[time=1732] In that dungeon were a group of believers.
[time=1735] One man by the name of James Ray, another by the name of Norman McDaniel.
[time=1741] Together they fought together to maintain their sanity.
[time=1746] They fought hard to maintain that state of mind that would give them the power to live in that time of suffering.
[time=1755] One night as they developed a system of communicating with each other, they used Morse code and they would knock on the wall in a Morse code
[time=1766] and they would send messages to each other.
[time=1770] One night the message came through on the Morse code.
[time=1779] As they started to translate, the words came low.
[time=1783] "I am with you always." And they began to realize that they were communicating in Scripture and pretty soon another inmate started to tap on the wall.
[time=1794] And they began to translate and it said, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1803] I shall not want." Yes, they found that by turning to the words of Scripture they could find strength and power and peace in the midst of their suffering.
[time=1818] As they shared their cells with lizards and rats and mosquitoes
[time=1824] and all kinds of insects, they realized that by giving their troubles to God, by giving to Him those needs, that they did not have to become bitter.
[time=1842] Indeed, by reciting Scripture, by trusting in God,
[time=1848] and by praising Him together they found that they could become better
[time=1854] in their Christian life.
[time=1857] This morning in our Scripture we have a scene.
[time=1861] Peter and John have just been released by the Sanhedrin.
[time=1865] The Sanhedrin had arrested them because so many had been coming to know the Lord Jesus Christ from their ministry.
[time=1872] And so they had arrested Him because this young church was a threat.
[time=1876] The young church was a threat to their Jewish system, their way of religion.
[time=1883] But knowing that they really had no charges against them, they released them, and they released them with this warning, never preached the word of Jesus Christ again.
[time=1894] And Peter and John left, and they went to their fellow disciples, and they told them about what had occurred.
[time=1902] But we notice in the verses of Scripture that they didn't pack up and go back to the fishing nets.
[time=1910] They didn't say, "We better obey this command for we don't want to go to prison or possibly even die." No, they said, "We will serve God." And although we will go through suffering, and perhaps go to prison, die, be tortured, and beaten, even though we be tortured, we will not become bitter.
[time=1936] For we will trust in God who gives us power and strength, and through this turmoil, we will be strong and will be better as believers.
[time=1947] This morning, many in our congregation, as we go through this Thanksgiving season, may not feel like giving thanks.
[time=1956] This morning, as we look out, I see those that have lost fathers, mothers in 1989.
[time=1965] I see those that have very, very sick children that we've been praying for every week.
[time=1972] I see those that are in physical pain, and although they don't admit it, I know that the pain is excruciating, perhaps right, at this very moment.
[time=1981] But the Bible teaches us that God is there, and He's powerful,
[time=1987] and He wants us not to run away from Him in bitterness, but to come to Him to put our burdens at His feet in bitterness.
[time=1997] Beginning with verse 23, we see the disciples' prayer, the disciples' prayer to God in this time of persecution.
[time=2006] On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
[time=2014] And when they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God.
[time=2019] "Sobber and Lord," they said, "you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them, you spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our Father David."
[time=2031] Why do the nation's rage and the people's plot in vain?
[time=2035] The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers gather together against the Lord
[time=2041] and against His anointed one.
[time=2043] Indeed, Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your Holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
[time=2054] They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
[time=2059] Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
[time=2066] Stretch out your hand to heal, and to speak your word.
[time=2071] Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your Holy servant Jesus.
[time=2078] After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
[time=2088] The first thing that I would like us to notice this morning, as we study this text of Scripture, is that they remembered that God was in control.
[time=2100] They remembered that God was in control.
[time=2105] In verse 24, we see what they said.
[time=2108] When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God.
[time=2113] "Sovron, Lord," they said.
[time=2115] "You made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and everything in them."
[time=2121] It's interesting that the Greek word that's used there for Lord is the Greek word despotah.
[time=2129] It's where we get our word despot in the English language.
[time=2132] Normally, the Greek word that's used for Lord is curious.
[time=2136] But in this case, they've changed it, and the word is the word where we get the idea of being a despot.
[time=2143] The idea being that when they addressed God, they addressed him as the sovereign ruler,
[time=2149] the one who controls all things, the one who is in charge of all that happens in all of his great creation.
[time=2158] They said, "You made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and everything in them.
[time=2166] You, O sovereign God, the only one with the power to create all things as you have done.
[time=2173] You, we commit our suffering to you.
[time=2177] You, sovereign Lord, the only one in the universe who can meet our needs and minister to us now.
[time=2184] You, we lay our sufferings at your feet." They reached out to God because they knew that the one with that perfect name, sovereign Lord,
[time=2197] was the one who was in perfect control.
[time=2201] They prayed in great confidence.
[time=2204] They didn't pack up and go back to their fishing nets.
[time=2207] They didn't run away and say, "What are we going to do now?" They knew that God was in control, that he had a plan, and that they were a part of it.
[time=2217] And as God's plan would unfold, whatever would happen to them, they were willing to go,
[time=2223] because God was in control, and God was in charge of their fate.
[time=2229] Death, jail, torture, pain, it didn't make any difference.
[time=2234] He was in control.
[time=2236] I recently became acquainted with the writings of a man by the name of Tim Hansel.
[time=2241] Perhaps some of you have read his great book, "You've got to keep dancing." Tim Hansel was and still is, in every way, a man's man.
[time=2249] But he was a great Christian who not only lived the Christian life, he attacks the Christian life.
[time=2256] And one day, Tim Hansel was climbing on the side of a glacier in the Sierra Mountains of California.
[time=2262] And as he climbed that glacier, his foot slipped.
[time=2267] And he felt the hammer coming out of the crevice on the side of the rock.
[time=2272] And soon he was plummeting 32 feet per second down the side of this glacier.
[time=2278] He came to a stop quite a ways down the mountain with a thud.
[time=2284] He writes in his book that it wasn't the fall that bothered him very much, but the landing really got to him.
[time=2291] Tim writes that he moved his hands, he moved his legs.
[time=2296] He didn't feel in any way that he had any broken bones and he rejoiced.
[time=2300] But as he tried to get up, he said the pain.
[time=2303] Oh, the pain.
[time=2306] For his body had been jarred by the fall.
[time=2310] He said he felt like he was two feet shorter than what he had been before.
[time=2315] Somehow he climbed out of the crevice.
[time=2317] He got into his car, he drove home and collapsed at home.
[time=2323] His wife took him to the hospital where he was x-rayed from head to toe.
[time=2327] And the doctors told him, "Mr. Hansel, you don't have any broken bones, but you have given your body a horrible jar.
[time=2336] We don't think there will be any more damage, but you're going to be in pain the rest of your life."
[time=2346] Tim Hansel writes that the doctors were a little bit wrong.
[time=2349] Indeed, there was some more deterioration.
[time=2352] Degenerative spine, degenerative discs in his back, things that caused excruciating pain.
[time=2360] Since that fall in 1974, Tim Hansel has lived on painkillers, shots and pills and aspirin tablets, trying to get up enough
[time=2370] and to take the edge enough off the pain so that he could make it through the day.
[time=2375] He said that he's refused to quit.
[time=2379] He's gone through the rage of asking, "Why me?" He's gone through the depression of saying, "Why did it have to happen to me?" But he said that he's come to the conclusion that God has a purpose in his suffering, and he has learned to accept it.
[time=2394] And Tim Hansel has said some, I think, some very, very profound things.
[time=2398] Number one, he said pain is inevitable, but misery is optional.
[time=2406] Pain will come to all of us as we go through our Christian life, whether it be physical pain or emotional suffering,
[time=2414] but misery because of that pain is optional because we have the opportunity to trust in God and to give the pain to him.
[time=2423] Tim Hansel told another, I think, very, very important point.
[time=2428] When he says that we have to remember in our Christian walk when we go through suffering, that there is a difference between happiness and joy.
[time=2437] Happiness is something that is controlled by the circumstances of our life.
[time=2442] Happiness is something that comes about as a result of a circumstance.
[time=2447] And when I make that last payment on a car loan, oh, I'm happy because I don't have to write those checks anymore.
[time=2454] That's a circumstance which makes me happy.
[time=2457] If I go to the store and get the opportunity to buy my wife a new dress, that makes me happy.
[time=2463] It makes her a lot happier.
[time=2466] But it gives us both a chance to be happy.
[time=2469] You know, preachers tend to be a little insecure, not me.
[time=2475] But preachers in general tend to be a little bit insecure.
[time=2479] Sometimes after I've preached here at Black Hawk or at some other church, I get to the car and being the secure preacher that I am,
[time=2488] I wait until we're at least in the car and the key's been turned, and then I say to my wife, how did I do?
[time=2495] Now, you know what I'm really asking?
[time=2498] I'm saying, Linda, was the word of God proclaimed properly and profoundly from the pulpit this morning?
[time=2505] No, that's not what I'm asking.
[time=2507] I'm saying, how did I do?
[time=2509] She looks over at me and said, did fine.
[time=2512] Oh, fine, huh?
[time=2515] Well, we drive down the street and being secure like I am, I wait to at least another 16th of a mile.
[time=2521] And I say to her again, how did I do?
[time=2523] Did fine.
[time=2526] I'm not expecting her to gush all over me, or give me a high five on the front seat.
[time=2530] But I expect to at least have her say something more than you did fine.
[time=2535] You know, we like people to stroke us a little bit, to pat us on the back.
[time=2539] That makes us feel happy.
[time=2541] But you know, the worst thing that happened about one of those rides we had not too long ago, when I found that we might be preaching this morning that Rick might be in Memphis as he is.
[time=2551] I remember telling Linda, as we discussed in the car on the way to Toledo for Thanksgiving, I don't know what I'm going to preach yet, we'll be working on that Saturday.
[time=2559] And my eight-year-old son drew, he gave me the ultimate statement.
[time=2564] He said to me, Dad, you know, I've been watching you preach, and I think I can help you do a better job next time.
[time=2574] Well, he shared his idea.
[time=2576] It's not a part of the sermon this morning.
[time=2580] Nevertheless, that's happiness.
[time=2582] Happiness is something that circumstances bring upon us.
[time=2585] But you know, joy is something different because joy is something that we can have,
[time=2591] despite whatever circumstances we may be in.
[time=2595] Whether we be in suffering, whether we be in pain, whatever it might be, we can have joy.
[time=2602] One writer has written that joy is that deep settled confidence that God is in control
[time=2609] of every area of our life.
[time=2612] That deep settled peace and contentment that we can have in our heart that no matter what goes wrong today,
[time=2619] no matter what persecution or suffering comes my way, I can still rejoice that I am a child of God
[time=2626] and that I have everlasting life and I can know the joy.
[time=2631] Yes, the disciples knew that.
[time=2634] They knew that joy.
[time=2635] We can know that joy today.
[time=2637] If we are a believer, and if we trust in God, and if we can remember as they did that he is in control,
[time=2645] then we can have that joy.
[time=2647] We can have that peace and contentment in our lives, no matter what we may be going through.
[time=2653] And then secondly, as we move along, I'd like to point out in verses 25 and 26 the second point,
[time=2659] and that is they remembered that they were on the winning side.
[time=2668] Verse 25, you spoke by the Holy Spirit.
[time=2671] Note the disciples testifying to the inerrancy of Scripture here.
[time=2675] You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our Father David.
[time=2681] Why do the nations rage, quoting now from Assam, and the people's plot in vain?
[time=2688] The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against His anointed one.
[time=2697] As they quoted this from the Assam of David, they realized that no matter what came their way,
[time=2703] they were on the winning side.
[time=2706] Notice that they said, "Why do the nations rage?" That idea of rage there means a type of pompous, arrogant prancing around like a horse.
[time=2719] And what they're saying is, even though the Romans or those who are in control over us, the Sanhedrin can prance in front of us with arrogance, we know that they're rebellion
[time=2730] against God is in vain.
[time=2732] And because of that, we can know we're on the winning side.
[time=2736] We can know that we're on the winning side.
[time=2739] Just as, just as they gathered together and plotted against our Lord, they plot against us.
[time=2748] But that's okay.
[time=2750] Notice in verse 26 it says that they plotted against His anointed one.
[time=2757] The idea being there that God anointed Jesus to the suffering that He would come and live
[time=2764] and go to the cross that you and I might have everlasting life.
[time=2768] It was designated an eternity by God in His providence that that would be.
[time=2775] And so, as I believe as they recited this, the disciples were realizing to themselves
[time=2782] that God, it was in your purpose and your plan for our Lord to suffer as He did.
[time=2790] And therefore, the suffering that we're going through is also within your plan for your people.
[time=2798] And they were praising Him that they could be a part of it, that they could be a part of it.
[time=2803] They were thankful because they knew that God was in control, that God wins in the end,
[time=2810] and that they were on the winning side.
[time=2813] In the neighborhood that I grew up in in Toledo, we had a lot of boys, most of us within a year or two of the same age.
[time=2820] And we used to love to play pickup games, and of course, three-fourths of the year we just loved to play basketball.
[time=2827] We had one boy who lived on our neighborhood who was six foot six in the seventh grade.
[time=2833] His name was John.
[time=2835] John was at least 12 inches taller than any of the rest of us in the seventh grade.
[time=2840] Well, as we would pick up sides for games, the only question was who got John on their team.
[time=2847] And so that time of deciding who got first pick was very important because everybody knew that if they got the first pick,
[time=2854] it was John, and they won, and the other side knew, well, we'll play the game, but we know we're not going to win.
[time=2860] Well, we would play, and we would choose up sides, and sometimes John was on my team, and sometimes he wasn't.
[time=2867] And boy, we would make a determined effort. It doesn't matter how big he is.
[time=2870] Let's go get him, guys. And boy, we would do all we could.
[time=2873] We would work as hard, we would hustle, we would shoot, we would do all that we could, hit the boards.
[time=2879] And, you know, every once in a while, we'd get a little bit of a lead.
[time=2883] We would do everything that we could within the rules to beat him.
[time=2886] If that didn't work, we'd go outside the rules and try to beat him.
[time=2890] But we did all that we could to beat John.
[time=2893] Well, one day we were winning, I remember, and it didn't really make a difference what day it was, but occasionally you'd be up 15 to 10, 16 to 12, 18 to 14, 20 to 15, one more basket, we win.
[time=2907] John's team would call time out.
[time=2910] We knew what they were going to do. John would come back on the court, stand right underneath the basket,
[time=2916] and they would just throw these high lob passes into him.
[time=2919] And before we knew it, it would be 21 to 20. They win, we lose again.
[time=2924] You know, there was a lesson there, because John was always on the winning team.
[time=2930] There was no way to stop him.
[time=2933] There was a confidence when you played with him, that you could throw bad passes, you could take bad shots,
[time=2939] you could do whatever you wanted.
[time=2941] If you were on John's team, he was going to win in the end.
[time=2947] In the verse of Scripture that we have in front of us, the disciples were saying that we have confidence that we will win.
[time=2954] We know that we're on the winning team, and no matter that people may oppose us today,
[time=2960] and we may suffer for the cause of Christ, we can know we will win in the end.
[time=2965] As a body of believers in the 1980s, we stand in opposition to many things.
[time=2971] We oppose abortion, and we oppose the fact that the sanctity of life is not important to so many in our society today.
[time=2979] At times, as we see bills passed and laws passed, we hurt, and we feel persecuted,
[time=2985] and we suffer because we know that innocent babies are dying.
[time=2990] We suffer. Other times, we know that children are being faced with cults or a drug epidemic,
[time=2998] and we wonder what can we do, but we can face it with courage knowing that no matter what happens in this life,
[time=3005] we're on the winning side.
[time=3008] Individually today, some of you are going through pain of a lost job.
[time=3013] You're going through physical pain of cancer.
[time=3016] You're going through the loss of a child. You're going through the loss of a spouse.
[time=3022] Some are hurting tremendously inside. The pain is excruciating.
[time=3029] But the Bible says that we can know, we can face it with confidence, because we can know that we're on the winning side.
[time=3035] Because one day, as Rick pointed out a couple of weeks ago, one day Christ will come through the eastern sky,
[time=3042] and when he does, he will establish his kingdom upon this earth, and we will reign with him in glory for a thousand years, and then in heaven for eternity.
[time=3052] Oh, there is power in knowing that we're on the winning side.
[time=3057] And thirdly this morning, I'd like to point out to us in verses 27 and 28, not only did they remember that they were on the winning side and that God was in control, but they remembered the sufferings of Jesus.
[time=3070] They remembered the sufferings of Jesus.
[time=3073] Indeed, Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles.
[time=3079] That means that they got together to persecute Christ and the people of Israel, the Jewish nation in this city, Jerusalem, conspired against your holy servant,
[time=3090] Jesus whom you anointed.
[time=3095] We know that Jesus went to the cross.
[time=3099] But before that, he was fought hard by Pilate and by his followers.
[time=3106] And finally, he was arrested and brought to trial before them.
[time=3110] And he was railroaded through in a trial, and then he was scourged and beaten, possibly to the point where he wasn't even recognizable. His face was so swollen.
[time=3121] And these disciples remembered the suffering that Christ went through during that time and how he was spit on and humiliated and tortured for us.
[time=3131] And then how he went to the cross and because of Pilate and the Jewish nation, how he went to the cross and felt those nails going through his hands and his feet.
[time=3142] They remembered his suffering and it gave them a perspective because they said,
[time=3150] "If my Lord suffered like that for me, then I need to be willing to suffer for him."
[time=3160] It gave them a great perspective to know that as Christ had suffered for them, they would be called upon to suffer for him, but they needed to do it willingly.
[time=3172] What a great perspective to have. What a great perspective.
[time=3176] Last summer, we did a study on suffering.
[time=3179] And you'll remember in that four-week study, we spoke about suffering, and I made this statement that not always will we find the answer of why we needed to suffer in this life,
[time=3190] and we won't always find the answer as to why a certain affliction or pain comes our way.
[time=3196] But I pointed out from Scripture that many times, many times, the suffering God allows in our life to perfect us, to establish us, to strengthen us,
[time=3208] and to make us a stronger believer.
[time=3211] Suffering in some ways is kind of a comprehensive way of preparing us for better service to our Lord.
[time=3221] Yes, suffering. They remembered the sufferings of Jesus.
[time=3228] And then, fourthly, I would like us to point out that they remembered their source of courage.
[time=3235] In verse 30, 29 and 30, they remembered their source of courage.
[time=3242] Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
[time=3250] Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your Holy Servant, Jesus.
[time=3260] The disciples realized that as they went to prayer that morning, knowing what was there for them down the road of time, knowing that they would probably be end up in prison, perhaps be killed, definitely be beaten and persecuted for their faith, and realize that although they wanted to stand for their Lord and proclaim Christ, they couldn't do it in their own strength.
[time=3285] And so they beseech their Lord and said to Him, "Now, Lord, give us the strength,
[time=3292] the courage to proclaim your world word boldly and strongly."
[time=3299] What they were asking God to do was to give them a special anointing,
[time=3306] special empowerment and filling of the Holy Spirit, a special anointing for a special service, a special strength that they might have the power to make it and to make it with His power, not on their own.
[time=3323] Oh, they realized that in their own creatureliness, their strength was weak, their strength was weak.
[time=3330] They didn't have the power to make it on their own.
[time=3334] But as they reached out to Christ and asked for that special power that comes through the filling of the Holy Spirit,
[time=3340] they came to the source of the power.
[time=3343] They knew would give them the courage that they needed for the task ahead.
[time=3348] In 2 Corinthians chapter 12, you don't need to turn to it, but in 2 Corinthians chapter 12,
[time=3355] the Apostle Paul speaks to this very, very well as he speaks about this special strength and power
[time=3361] that can only come from God.
[time=3363] Beginning with verse 8, three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me, this thorn in the flesh.
[time=3370] But He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[time=3377] Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses in weaknesses so that Christ's power may rest on me."
[time=3386] That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties.
[time=3395] For when I am weak, then I am strong.
[time=3400] Paul was saying that God's grace and God's power takes over in the life of a believer at the point where our strength fails,
[time=3409] then His grace takes over and gives us a special power and energy that comes from knowing that the Holy Spirit lives in us,
[time=3418] and it's a special power that we can gain and work on.
[time=3422] Yes, Paul was one of those who said, "I can't make it on my own."
[time=3428] I remember one time in my life, when I felt very, very similar to that, as my father was dying a couple of years ago and was slowly going through the process of that illness.
[time=3441] I remember going to visit many, many times and getting behind at school, and all of a sudden came to a point where there was four weeks to go in the semester, and I looked at all the things that had to be done, and I can remember the anxiety and the feeling in my stomach.
[time=3463] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir and Soloist Keith Brodigam in Lynn Roll.
[time=3470] The message today was from our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=3474] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3482] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins,
[time=3489] and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3492] I ask you to come in and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my Savior today.
[time=3498] In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3500] [AMEN] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
