[time=102] (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=122] Thank you for joining us.
[time=124] Rick's message today is entitled "A Rare Individual with an Attitude of Gratitude." Depression, loneliness, anxiety, and many other negative emotions are brought on by ourselves.
[time=136] The best cure is often within ourselves as well.
[time=140] A change of attitude usually results in a change of emotions.
[time=144] Psalm 92 says, "It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord." Today, we will discover the value of giving thanks.
[time=152] Being thankful is the best thing that we can do for our relationship with God, with others, and with ourselves.
[time=160] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Luke, chapter 17.
[time=166] We will be looking at verses 11 through 17.
[time=170] Our special music today includes a number from the Brass Choir and a solo from Brian Lowson.

[time=1462] Thank you, Brian.
[time=1464] Would you bow that we could pray together?
[time=1466] God, we are grateful for your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1470] These days when we celebrate His birth are some of the days that we feel life's joy more than any other.
[time=1480] For some of us, it's the hour of tradition.
[time=1484] It's the season.
[time=1486] It's the decorations in the tensile.
[time=1488] It's the music.
[time=1488] It's the weather, and they all add to a mood.
[time=1492] But Father ours is more than a mood.
[time=1496] Ours is a grateful heart that Jesus Christ would come.
[time=1500] That He would give up His throne in heaven, that He would take up a cross on earth.
[time=1506] And then to consider He did it all for me.
[time=1510] Oh God, we are so thankful today.
[time=1512] We meet in these moments to worship you.
[time=1516] And so we give you now the adoration of our heart, the gift of our lips singing your praises, the reverence of our spirit.
[time=1526] We bow before you.
[time=1526] You are King.
[time=1528] You are Lord, and we love you.
[time=1530] We've come to meet with you.
[time=1534] We use this time, not just to give, but to get.
[time=1538] Father, we come because we get so much.
[time=1542] We come with empty cups, and somehow they leave filled.
[time=1546] We come with burdens, and somehow they grow lighter.
[time=1550] We come with concerns, and we walk away with hope.
[time=1554] And so we are grateful that we come to give you our worship, and we get lifted up.
[time=1560] Thank you, Father.
[time=1562] Thank you for strength you give in hard times.
[time=1566] And we ask you to give that strength to Sharon Huddleson in the death of her father.
[time=1572] And we ask you to give that strength to Tony Woods in the loss of his sister, Ted Robinson in the death of his brother.
[time=1582] We ask you to give strength to the Moors as they go through the hard times, as the chemotherapy is so painful for little Amy.
[time=1592] We ask you to give her body the ability to recover.
[time=1594] Thank you that Greg Hindle could play basketball this weekend.
[time=1600] Thank you for good doctors, good hospitals, a great country.
[time=1604] Thank you for this church, the number of people who have prayed for me and my family.
[time=1610] I am thankful.
[time=1612] Thanks for the privilege of being your son.
[time=1616] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1620] Williams Jennings said, the greatest discovery of our generation is that a person can alter their life by altering their attitude.
[time=1646] In 1618, Germany entered into what became known as the Thirty Years War.
[time=1654] It lasted until 1648, and those 30 years earned its name and its reputation.
[time=1662] During those 30 years, one half of the population of Germany was either taken as a casualty of war or a casualty of the diseases brought on by the war.
[time=1674] One half of the Germanic population died.
[time=1678] Two-thirds of the farmland, two-thirds of the towns, and two-thirds of the villages were destroyed.
[time=1688] One man who survived the Thirty Years War was a pastor by the name of Martin Rinkert.
[time=1694] In the Thirty Years War, for an extended period of times, he did as many as 40 funerals a day, 40 funerals a day.
[time=1708] In the middle of the Forty Years War, two events happened in the life of Martin Rinkert.
[time=1716] On one of those days, the funeral that he performed was that of his own wife's, and on one of those days, he penned these words.
[time=1728] Now, thank we all our God with hard and hands and voices, who wondrous things has done in whom this world rejoices,
[time=1738] who from our mother's arms has blessed us on our way with countless gifts of love and is still ours today.
[time=1750] Sounds like a hymn that would have been penned by a man who had just experienced some of the greatest joys in life and was reflecting with gratitude.
[time=1760] It was a hymn penned by a man reflecting in gratitude, but not in the midst of life's greatest joys, but amidst life's greatest heard the Thirty Years War.
[time=1770] It is remarkable that we can alter our very lives by altering our minds.
[time=1778] This morning, I would like us to look at the life of a remarkable man with an attitude of gratitude.
[time=1786] If you have a Bible, please turn to Luke chapter 17, and here we meet ten lepers who met Jesus Christ and walked away with their bodies changed,
[time=1796] but only one of them walked away with their attitude changed.
[time=1802] On his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
[time=1816] As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him.
[time=1820] They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice.
[time=1824] "Jesus, master, have pity on us!" When he saw them, he said, "Go show yourselves to the priest, and as they went, they were cleansed."
[time=1840] One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.
[time=1846] He threw himself at Jesus' speed and thanked him, and he was a Samaritan.
[time=1856] Jesus asked, "We're not all ten cleansed. Where are the other nine?"
[time=1862] Was no one found to return and give praise to God, except this foreigner, then he said to him, "Rise and go. Your faith has made you well."
[time=1876] These ten men had a disease called leprosy.
[time=1882] Before we go too far, allow me to explain leprosy to you.
[time=1886] In the Old Testament, Leviticus, chapters 13 and 14, describe leprosy as a condition, and they describe leprosy as a way of treatment.
[time=1898] But the leprosy of the Bible is not modern-day leprosy as we've defined it in medical terms.
[time=1906] There is an exact disease called leprosy, but in the Old Testament, leprosy was a very generic term.
[time=1914] It was a term that talked about anything that was a disease of the skin.
[time=1918] So eczema, psoriasis, a bleeding sore, a boil, a pustular dermatitis, ringworm, impantego.
[time=1928] All of those things would be called leprosy.
[time=1932] Two thousand years ago and before, when the Bible was penned, that was a generic term, leprosy.
[time=1940] Just like we today use the generic term flu, but there are various kinds of flu.
[time=1948] They talked about all diseases of the skin as leprosy.
[time=1954] Included in that generic term was what we now medically call leprosy.
[time=1960] It is a disease that affects primarily the skin originally.
[time=1966] It will turn red and brown, even white.
[time=1970] It will break open into open lesions and those are highly infectious.
[time=1976] The bacteria that causes that is very contagious from one person to another.
[time=1982] It enters through both the skin and the mucous membranes.
[time=1986] A second characteristic of leprosy, though, is not just the ulcerated skin,
[time=1992] but it also attacks the central nervous system and it numbs the nerves,
[time=1998] particularly in the extremity of the hands and arms, feet and ankles, and the face.
[time=2008] A person with leprosy will grow nodules and their skin will become deformed on their face,
[time=2016] particularly their ears and their hands.
[time=2020] It will appear as though hunks of flesh are actually falling off.
[time=2024] And because the nerves are damaged, the individual doesn't feel pain,
[time=2030] and so is often injured and is never cared for because they're unaware of the injury.
[time=2036] There is a form of it that is called terberculoid, which means the individual is very susceptible to tuberculosis.
[time=2044] In that form of leprosy, the person actually goes through not only the loss of nerve sensation,
[time=2050] but atrophy of the muscles and often their hands are reduced to scarcely functioning claws.
[time=2060] In biblical times, they had no antibiotics, they had no penicillin, they had no medicine, no surgical procedures, there was no way of curing leprosy.
[time=2070] But some of the diseases that were called in the generic form leprosy were curable with nothing more than time.
[time=2078] For example, the own immunity of the body might cure an individual of something like ringworm,
[time=2084] perhaps in pentagon, boils or other skin infections.
[time=2090] If a person who had leprosy was cured, they had to present themselves to the priest,
[time=2098] who would then make the determination over seven days whether they were clean or not.
[time=2106] Now if you have an infection today, please see one of the doctors in the congregation, they will decide whether you are clean, I'll leave that to them.
[time=2114] But if a person was labeled a leper, in the generic sense,
[time=2122] the only medical solution they could fall upon was isolating the leper,
[time=2128] so as not to infect the larger community.
[time=2132] So if an individual was a carrier of some infectious disease of the skin,
[time=2140] they had to remove themselves from their home, from their family, from their community, and they had to move outside of the village.
[time=2148] There they would only find food or water through the mercy of others, who would go to a designated spot and leave them food and water.
[time=2158] They could not go to the marketplace, they could not go to the well, they could contaminate the entire population.
[time=2164] It seemed harsh, and it was, but it was as necessary as it was painful.
[time=2172] If an individual was a leper out in the community and individuals approached them,
[time=2180] that person who was a leper had the responsibility of calling out in front of himself,
[time=2186] unclean, unclean, so the general population would know clear away,
[time=2192] a contaminated individual was coming through.
[time=2196] Lepercy reduced a man or a woman to nothing, not only physically, but emotionally as well.
[time=2204] You were removed from your family, from your occupation, from your town.
[time=2208] You were huddled into one colony, a colony of fellow lepers.
[time=2214] There, your birth order did not matter.
[time=2216] There, your former occupation was of no significance.
[time=2220] There, your nationality was not an issue.
[time=2224] There would have been the formerly rich huddled together with the formerly poor.
[time=2228] There would have been the Gentiles in association with the Jews.
[time=2234] The Samaritans were no different than either.
[time=2236] It was a painful existence.
[time=2240] Jesus is in the country.
[time=2242] He's working his way from city to city, headed towards Jerusalem.
[time=2246] He's now in that undefined border between Galilean and Samaria, and as he's coming near a village,
[time=2254] still in the wilderness, ten lepers see him.
[time=2256] They probably have heard of Jesus.
[time=2258] They probably heard the story of how he had healed other lepers, and they've come to him for healing.
[time=2264] Appropriately, they keep their distance, and they shout, "Have mercy on us!"
[time=2272] And Jesus draws near and equally as appropriately tells them to go show themselves to the priest.
[time=2280] That was proper procedure.
[time=2282] Ten of them leave.
[time=2284] Ten of them are cured as they leave.
[time=2288] Nine of them are never heard from again.
[time=2292] Only one returns.
[time=2296] And that is the main point of this story, that Jesus healed ten people of a painful, debilitating,
[time=2304] destroying disease that not only eliminated them physically from the joys of life,
[time=2312] but eliminated them socially, economically, and psychologically from any joy in life.
[time=2320] And in a moment, in a word, Jesus turns ten lives from rags to riches by healing them.
[time=2330] But only one out of ten turn around and come back to thank him.
[time=2338] The point of what Jesus was teaching through this episode was the point of human nature.
[time=2346] We are too often, we are too often, in grateful.
[time=2354] We are too often, unthankful.
[time=2358] We are too often not willing to express our gratitude.
[time=2364] By way of application, I would like to share three reasons why we ought to be grateful.
[time=2370] Reason number one is this, being grateful is the best thing that we can do for our relationship with God.
[time=2380] Being grateful is the very best thing we can do for our relationship with God.
[time=2386] G. Campbell Morgan writing on these verses said, Christ values gratitude and he misses it when it's not expressed.
[time=2398] The nine were so absorbed in their new happiness, they could not spare a thought for its source.
[time=2406] Christ values our gratitude, and when it is not expressed, he misses it.
[time=2414] Of all the presidents that we have had in our country, none was more magnanimous and none more merciful than Abraham Lincoln.
[time=2422] There was a steady stream of people knocking at his office door.
[time=2426] This one to ask for mercy for her son who was sentenced to penitentiary.
[time=2430] This one to ask mercy for her husband who was sentenced to die.
[time=2434] This one asking mercy for himself.
[time=2438] And more than any other president, Lincoln took the time to hear the appeals and more than any other president was the man who would grant clemency or pardon.
[time=2450] The story is told and not came at the door. The president said, what can I do for you, madam?
[time=2460] Placing a covered basket on the table, she said, Mr. President, I've not come here today to ask any favor for myself or for anyone else.
[time=2470] I heard that you were very fond of cookies and I've come here to bring you this basket full of cookies.
[time=2478] Tears trickled down the gaunt face of President Lincoln.
[time=2482] He stood speechless for a moment and said, thousands have come into this office since I became president.
[time=2492] But you are the first one to come asking no favor for yourself or for anyone else.
[time=2500] If that would touch the heart of a president, think what it does to the heart of a Heavenly Father who sits and hears Rick Hawks.
[time=2508] A thousand times saying, oh God, would you help? Oh God, would you give? Oh God, would you put your hand on my little nephew?
[time=2516] Oh God, would you hear our church of its ingratitude? Oh God, would you change the values of people that they'd be more generous?
[time=2522] Oh God, would you speak to this one's heart that they would receive? Oh God, would you?
[time=2528] It begins to sound a lot like that line of children in the lobby of Glenbrook Mall waiting to sit on the flap of a man in a red suit to say,
[time=2538] what I want for Christmas is everything on pages 110 through 237 of the Sears and Robot catalog.
[time=2552] I wonder what God would do. If I came to him, I said, God, can I have five minutes of your time? And God, I don't want to thank.
[time=2560] God, I just want to thank you for my wife. What an encourager she is. God, I want to thank you for three children. What a joy they are.
[time=2568] God, I want to thank you for fingerprints on the window because where there are little fingerprints, there are little fingers.
[time=2576] God, I want to thank you for a big backyard. I don't mind mowing it because it's become a football stadium for the Hawks clan every year.
[time=2584] God, I want to thank you for a church. I want to thank you for the body of people who have loved and of care.
[time=2590] You know, I think God would be a lot like President Lincoln. I think that a tear might come down his eye because it would be so unusual for him to entertain me for five minutes without a wish or a want.
[time=2606] Allow me to share with you just a few brief Psalms that tell us how God is so pleased with our gratitude. Psalm 92 says, "It is a good thing to give thanks unto God."
[time=2620] Psalm 116, "How can I repay the Lord for all of His goodness to me? I will lift up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord.
[time=2630] I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all His people. Oh Lord, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.
[time=2642] You have freed me from my chains. I will sacrifice a thank offering to you and call upon the name of the Lord."
[time=2650] Psalm 107 verse 21, "Let us give thanks to the Lord for His unfailing love. Let us sacrifice thank offerings and tell of His works with songs of joy."
[time=2668] We ought to be grateful and express our gratitude because it's the best thing we can do for our relationship with God.
[time=2678] He has made us and He has made us for Himself and we please Him when we praise Him and express our gratitude to Him.
[time=2690] Here's Psalm 100, "Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth. Worship the Lord with gladness. Come before Him with joyful songs.
[time=2700] Know that the Lord is God. It is He who made us and we are His, we are His people, the sheep of His pasture, and are into His gates with thanksgiving.
[time=2716] Enter into His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him and praise His name."
[time=2726] One of the preoccupations of life usually at the point when we're about to finish our high school years and enter into college and career is the preoccupation with God's will.
[time=2740] It's not unusual for the typical college co-ed to say, "Lord, I just pray that it's your will, that Joe and I get married, and God, I know that's your will."
[time=2752] She comes and says, "Pastor, don't you think it's God's will for Joe and I to get married?"
[time=2758] I usually say, "Well, I don't know. Let's ask Joe. But we get preoccupied with God's will. Oh God, I really pray that I get that job.
[time=2766] If I got that job and if it was your will for me to get that job, I know everything would be right.
[time=2770] Pastor, don't you think it's God's will for me to get that job? I don't know. Why don't you ask the head of personnel?"
[time=2776] We get God's will and we think of it as a person or position.
[time=2782] If I just can marry that person or if I can just have that position, boy, that'd be God's will.
[time=2786] Here's God's will. In everything, give thanks for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[time=2794] In everything, give thanks.
[time=2798] We need to be grateful because it's the best thing we can do for our relationship with God.
[time=2804] It pleases him when we thank him and it's the purpose for which he has made us.
[time=2810] It is his will for our lives to be thankful.
[time=2814] A second reason why we ought to be grateful.
[time=2818] It's the best thing we can do for our relationship with others.
[time=2822] I'd like to draw on a story by a man by the name of M. Scott Peck. He's now a psychiatrist.
[time=2830] When he was doing his residence, he had to do tour of duty in the emergency room.
[time=2834] A lady came in. One of the other doctors came to, Dr. Peck and said, "Hey, you want to go into psychiatry?
[time=2842] This woman's a real case. You go handle her." Dr. Peck said that he went, found this lady, about seven years old, and her problem was that she was no longer able to care for herself.
[time=2856] She was going to need some type of assistance. She had six children, not one of them, would welcome her into her home.
[time=2866] Here's how Dr. Peck tells the story. Not one of them, she shrelled.
[time=2872] You wouldn't believe the way I sweated for those kids. I broke my back for them.
[time=2878] And now not one of them wants to help me. They always were no good.
[time=2882] Like dirty little animals. They were always out for themselves. They took my life's blood and left me.
[time=2890] You'd think at least one of them would be willing to pay me back, but no.
[time=2894] Let their mother starve for all they care.
[time=2898] Dr. Peck says, "I tried to explore with her other possibilities, alternatives, nursing homes, adult communities, senior citizens, communities, things like that."
[time=2910] She would hear none of it.
[time=2912] I gently suggested that she might want to return to the psychiatric clinic for a discussion of her actions and what she could do to repair her relationship with her children.
[time=2924] "It's not my responsibility to repair anything," she shrieked. "They're the ones that owe me something."
[time=2932] "And what is it you would like me to do?" said the doctor.
[time=2938] "I want you to tell me how it is that a woman in this country can work herself to the bone for 70 years and then not one of her six children offered to take her into their home in her old age."
[time=2954] The doctor said, "I decided to take her at her word and answer her question," he said.
[time=2958] "As I've listened to you talk about your children, it's become clear to me that you don't like them. In fact, you hate them. In fact, you are a hate-filled person."
[time=2970] And that makes you mean and unpleasant. No one wants a mean or an unpleasant woman in their home.
[time=2978] "I can understand why your children don't want you to live with them. You would make their lives miserable with your personality."
[time=2984] He said, "She turned on her heels, marched out to the emergency room, never to return."
[time=2990] Much later, he looked back and he said, "Now having practiced psychiatry for a number of years, I don't know that I did the lady any good, but I don't know that I did the lady any good."
[time=3000] "But I don't know that I would handle the situation any different either." You know what this woman's problem was? She was mean, she was angry, she was hate-filled, and she hadn't yet learned that porcupines are hard to hug.
[time=3020] Porcupines are really hard to hug, particularly the ones with their quills extended.
[time=3028] And this was a woman going through life with all of her quills set on edge with her barbs out saying, "Nobody wants to hug me."
[time=3040] And finally, somebody at least had the courtesy of telling her, "You're not very huggable."
[time=3046] And the very best thing that we can do for our relationship with others is to be grateful.
[time=3054] Each of us carries through life a basket, and life puts a lot in our basket.
[time=3060] It puts a lot of joys in there, puts a lot of things to be happy about, a lot of things to be joyful about, a lot of fun times, a lot of laughter, a lot of good music.
[time=3068] But life also puts a lot of pain in there, a lot of disappointments. It puts car accidents and comas in that basket.
[time=3078] It puts cancer and lymphoma and leukemia in our basket. It puts old age and bad needs and glasses and spectacles.
[time=3088] It puts ears that don't hear as well, and feet that are growing bunions, and all that goes in the basket.
[time=3098] But when we uncover the basket, it's what we choose to take out that determines our attitude.
[time=3106] And it's what we choose to show others from our basket that determines how well they'll accept this.
[time=3114] Porcupines are hard to hug.
[time=3120] The third thing that I would suggest is this, having a grateful heart is the best thing that you can do for your relationship with yourself.
[time=3132] My son is a keeper. He doesn't want to depart with anything. His basket is full.
[time=3140] I'm particularly talking about the toy box in his closet.
[time=3144] We go through an exercise once a year that we should go through once a month. I go upstairs with a giant leaf-sized plastic bag.
[time=3154] And I approach his toy box, and I say, "Come on, Adam, we're going to clean this out." All that's in that basket are parts. There's not a toy intact.
[time=3164] There are puzzles that have 100 pieces. We only have 57. But he keeps them all.
[time=3174] And we started this process last night. It wasn't pretty. I just started unloading the toy box.
[time=3182] And I suspended in front of his eyes a broken helicopter, one blade that doesn't go around, a hoist that doesn't turn, a tail that is broke.
[time=3194] I said, "Adam, can we pitch that?" "Oh, look at that. This is the neatest iphant." You know, he's flying it around the room. I said, "Okay, we'll keep the airplane. Put it back in the box."
[time=3204] "Okay, Adam, this puzzle, all the pieces are pitching." "Oh, no, Dad, I'll find them somewhere. We'll keep them." And he puts it back in there.
[time=3210] "Okay, Adam, look at this. Uncle Wilbur shouldn't have bought you this anyway. I mean, this piece of junk." "Oh, no, Dad, Uncle Wilbur bought that. You know what? Everything that was in his basket had value to him.
[time=3222] Everything, it was broken. It was mangled. He wanted to keep it, and he'd put it back together and console himself that it was close enough to fix."
[time=3232] I went downstairs, folded up my trash bag, put it back in the shelf. He loaded the toy box up. We're both happy campers.
[time=3242] You know, life's a lot like that toy box. When you look into your basket, what do you see?
[time=3246] Sometimes, all we see are the broken parts and the pieces that are missing.
[time=3252] You know, a little six-year-old boy just sees nothing but opportunity.
[time=3256] It's what you see in your basket and what you focus on will make all the difference in the world.
[time=3264] And he was grateful that Uncle Wilbur bought him. We don't have an Uncle Wilbur.
[time=3266] I just don't want to hurt the Uncle who buys the tape and listen to it.
[time=3270] He was a junk. He shouldn't have bought it. He was happy. Uncle Wilbur got it. It was good enough for him.
[time=3276] That's a winning attitude. You know, people are making big, big money these days, writing books on positive mental attitude.
[time=3286] And I'm all for it because if you would just develop a positive mental attitude, it'd be the best thing you could do for yourself.
[time=3296] And you ought to start with gratitude.
[time=3298] Of all the positive mental attitude cliches that have come down through the years, allow me to share with you my favorite one.
[time=3306] It goes like this. If you growl all day, don't be surprised if you're dog-tired at night.
[time=3314] Let me take you to another passage of Scripture that I think is so important.
[time=3320] It's Philippians chapter 4. Turn there if you will.
[time=3324] This passage is going to give us a formula for right positive emotions.
[time=3336] I see a number of friends here today who are all in the caring professions. Many of them are counselors.
[time=3342] And their schedule would be a lot like mine. Most of my counseling begins like this.
[time=3348] Well, I don't feel. I don't feel like. I don't feel that. I don't feel.
[time=3356] And most of us allow our behavior and our attitudes to be an extension of our feelings.
[time=3366] When our feelings should be an extension of our attitudes and our behavior.
[time=3374] In fact, if you wait till you feel like doing the right thing, you won't ever have to do the right thing.
[time=3382] 'Tis the season,' said one person, when one species of God's creation ceases to gobble and the other starts.
[time=3392] During this season, I find it very difficult to diet, to exercise, because I feel like eating.
[time=3404] And to assist me in that, my mother, my mother-in-law, my wife, all feel like cooking.
[time=3410] Strange thing. When we went to buy our house, we had the hardest time finding a house with four bedrooms and no kitchen.
[time=3418] They all came with kitchens. She didn't want a kitchen. But this time of year, she wants to cook.
[time=3422] And I eat. Then over at the school, we have this 12 days of Christmas, where people bring in food every day.
[time=3430] And the hardest thing for me to do is stop eating, because I don't feel like it.
[time=3434] Now look at Philippians 4, it says this.
[time=3438] Verse 8, "Finally, brothers, whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, excellent, praiseworthy, think about such things."
[time=3448] There's step 1, "think." Next verse says, "Whatever you have learned or received or heard in me or seen in me, put into practice."
[time=3458] That's step 2, do. Notice the next phrase, and then the God of peace will be with you.
[time=3464] If you want peace, if you want contentment, if you want fulfillment, if you want positive emotions in your life, don't wait for them to happen.
[time=3474] You have to think about what is lovely, pure, just, and then you must do what is right.
[time=3480] And after you think, and you do, then you'll feel what is right.
[time=3486] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir, our Brass Choir, and soloist Brian Lowson.
[time=3508] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3510] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3516] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3520] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3526] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3530] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3534] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3538] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3542] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3566] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1424 or use the sermon title "A Rare Individual with an Attitude of Gratitude."
[time=3576] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3590] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from our viewers and friends.
[time=3594] Perhaps you have thought about sending a gift to help underwrite this ministry.
[time=3598] Why not do it today?
[time=3600] I know it would be an encouragement to Pastor Rick and the entire Bible hour staff.
[time=3606] To correspond with us, simply write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468, 1, 5.
[time=3614] Now speaking for Pastor Rick Hawks, this is Paul Branks inviting you to join us each week at this time for the Bible hour.
