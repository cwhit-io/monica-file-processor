[time=0] (mysterious music)
[time=30] (beeping) - Nothing is more disturbing
[time=54] than when our kingdom is threatened.
[time=57] And Jesus Christ threatens each of our kingdoms.
[time=61] (dramatic music) - Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=75] Thank you for joining us.
[time=78] Rick's message today is entitled, "The King Who Was Afraid Of A Baby." The birth of Christ was greeted with joy by the wise men.
[time=86] Adoration by the shepherds, passive indifference by the elders, and active hostility by Herod the king.
[time=94] The baby Jesus was a threat to him.
[time=97] Herod was the puppet king on the end of the strings of Rome.
[time=100] He was not of the royal line of David, nor was he even a Hebrew.
[time=106] His illegitimate throne was challenged by the news of a legitimate royal heir.
[time=110] Herod was not the only one whose kingdom was threatened by Christ. In reality, each of us rule over the kingdom of our own lives, and Christ is a threat to our own self rule.
[time=121] We encourage you to locate your Bibles
[time=127] and study along with us as Rick shares with us from the book of Matthew, chapter two, verses one through 12.
[time=133] Special music today includes a musical package from the children's choir, and a solo from Kathy Hawks.
[time=144] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a number from the Living Christmas Tree entitled, "Good Christian Men Rejoice." (upbeat music)

[time=340] Love that phrase in there. "Now you need not fear the grave." Jesus Christ was born to save. What a great fact to know that He is our Savior.
[time=350] We need to go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere that Jesus Christ is born.
[time=356] 138, please. We'll sing the refrain, then we'll sing the three verses, and then the refrain again of 138.

[time=531] Born as a baby in the midnight, bringing us eternal day. Came like the dawning of the sunlight. Came to take our sins away.
[time=546] Though they wouldn't let him in the end at night, you can let him in your heart.
[time=553] While we hate to see him wearing silken rolls, you can come just as you are. Born as a baby in the midnight, bringing us eternal day.
[time=568] Came like the dawning of the sunlight. Came to take our sins away.
