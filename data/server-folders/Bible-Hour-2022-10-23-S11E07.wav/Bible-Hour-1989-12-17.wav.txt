[time=61] - Herod was ignorant and angry.
[time=65] He didn't know where Christ was to be born, but he was threatened by the very idea.
[time=70] The scribes were academic, but indifferent.
[time=74] They knew where the Messiah was to be born, but they could have cared less.
[time=78] Knowledge is a dangerous thing.
[time=81] It may not help you, it may condemn you.
[time=84] (intense music)
[time=94] Welcome to the Christmas edition of the Bible hour.
[time=99] We trust that this has been a blessed and meaningful time of year as we celebrate the birth of our Lord.
[time=104] Rick's message today is entitled "Wise Men Still Seeking." The birth of Christ prompted a variety of responses.
[time=112] Herod was angry.
[time=114] The scribes were apathetic.
[time=116] Only the wise men were accepted.
[time=118] Those closest to him who knew him the most cared the least.
[time=122] The scribes told Herod exactly where the Messiah was to be born, but remained indifferent themselves.
[time=128] They teach us a critical lesson.
[time=130] It is not what we know that is important, but what we do with what we know that counts.
[time=136] The passing of 2,000 years has changed little.
[time=140] Today, these three reactions greet any mention of Christ, anger, apathy, and acceptance.
[time=147] Today, we will examine why wise men still seek Him.
[time=154] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Matthew chapter 2.
[time=159] We will be looking at verses 1 through 12.
[time=163] Special music today includes a selection from "Celebration."
[time=169] The Handbell Choir, and a solo from Jenny Klanske.
[time=176] We now join our service with a special number by "Celebration."
[time=180] [MUSIC]
[time=187] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=206] Forever, more, let is a fill here, and let there be praise.
[time=215] He has come to the earth as a baby, God's annoying to why.
[time=221] As a gift to the heart that is waiting a Savior and a Son.
[time=228] Soar with your voices, with gladness seeing.
[time=235] Proplain to all the earth, and Jesus Christ is King.
[time=241] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=248] Sing to the Lord, here in the glory, the glory.
[time=254] Let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=260] Forever, more, let is a fill here, and let there be praise.
[time=269] He has the praise of His people, and He dwells deep within.
[time=276] The peace that He brings, and can He call.
[time=279] His mercy knows the land.
[time=283] So lift your voices, with gladness seeing.
[time=289] Proplain to all the earth, and Jesus Christ is King.
[time=296] Let there be praise, let there be praise, let there be joy in our hearts.
[time=302] Forever, more, let is a fill here, and let there be praise.
[time=316] Let there be praise.
[time=319] [APPLAUSE]
[time=325] Let there be praise in our hearts for what the Lord has done.
[time=330] When the wise men came to visit Jesus, they brought some of the most very important and extravagant gifts that they could find.
[time=338] And the question is asked, what can we give Him, while we can give Him our hearts?
[time=341] So as we sing about the kings and what they brought, remember that we too offer ourselves to the Lord for His service.
[time=349] 166, we'll sing the first, second, and fifth stanzas together of 166.
[time=367] [MUSIC - 109 seconds]
[time=502] During the Living Christmas Trees, just before we begin our performances, we've been privileged to have the handbells play from the balcony.
[time=510] We appreciate their ministry each night.
[time=512] They're with us today, and we'll need to listen to them as they play again from the balcony, a song entitled, Now is Born the Divine Christ Child.
[time=521] [MUSIC - 227 seconds]
[time=754] Hello again, and we are thankful you're joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=758] Pete, the Living Christmas Tree is all but over.
[time=762] Rick, it's hard to imagine.
[time=764] We've worked for so many weeks in preparation of the music and the set, and here we have just two concerts left as of this taping.
[time=770] Well, we wish we could invite you, but by the time you're even watching this broadcast, it's the day before Christmas, and we want to wish you all very Merry Christmas.
[time=778] The Colby family here with us, thanks for coming in today and saying hello.
[time=782] Well, Rick, it is a delight to have my entire family home for the holiday seasons, and I think since I can remember anything about Christmas, we've been involved in church pageants, and this year is no exception.
[time=794] But it's great to have everyone here and involved in our church work, and I'd like to introduce to you first my wife, Carol.
[time=800] Thanks, Pete.
[time=802] It's a privilege to work with Pete here at Blackhawk, especially during the Christmas season for the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=808] This year I had the privilege of being involved in decorating the tree, along with the ladies from our church, and then singing in the tree.
[time=814] And one of the special things about singing in the tree would be, each evening I've watched people laugh and cry and then worship the Christ child.
[time=824] The other thing that's always special for me is to have my children home for Christmas, and Peter's home from college, and then to have Lisa and Scott sing in the tree, and then Andy involved in the pageant tree this year.
[time=836] And I'd like to wish you a Merry Christmas this year.
[time=838] I'm Andy, and I'm a freshman at Blackhawk Christian and currently participating in basketball.
[time=846] Hi, I'm Lisa, and I'm also currently involved in singing in the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=850] I've also helped out with our children's choirs here at church, and also busy decorating our home and baking cookies for the holidays.
[time=858] I'm Scott, and I'm in my second year at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake,
[time=864] and having a very Merry Christmas this year.
[time=868] Hi, I'm Peter. I'm a junior at Liberty University, and I'm a marketing major.
[time=872] And I'm delighted to have my family here with me.
[time=876] My wife, Kathy, is a regular part of the Bible Hour.
[time=878] Perhaps you were watching a week ago, as she sang the Lord's Prayer.
[time=884] This is my son Adam, Adam's in first grade this year, and he's six and a half years old.
[time=890] He'll be seven this spring, and this is Rebecca, and Rebecca's in third grade, and I get to help her out with her Christmas party at school this year.
[time=898] And this is our oldest daughter, Rachel.
[time=900] Rachel, what's your favorite subject at school?
[time=904] Indiana history.
[time=904] Indiana history, that's my body.
[time=906] I was a history major in college, but I didn't have Indiana history.
[time=910] Will you help me when I need some help?
[time=912] Well, we're certainly thankful to be together with our families and to be able to share these moments with you.
[time=918] Coming up, we have a service on Christmas Eve that involves music and communion and worship.
[time=924] We want to invite you to be a part of it.
[time=926] Many of you are watching on Christmas Eve morning right now here in Fort Wayne.
[time=930] We want to encourage you to come tonight at five o'clock.
[time=934] Now, please make note that's a change. We had announced it at six.
[time=938] It's going to be at five o'clock, and we'll have as a part of that a special cantata.
[time=942] Rick, part of the choir will be joining with us as we sing a new cantata entitled First Light.
[time=948] It's written by Tom Fedkin.
[time=950] It will be a great inspiration as we, again, remember the birth of our Savior along with that communion service.
[time=956] It's a very special time for our family to get together that evening.
[time=958] Well, we hope you can join us at five o'clock on December the 24th for that service of worship and praise.
[time=966] We also want to encourage you to begin a brand new year and a new decade with a commitment to studying God's Word as a part of your life.
[time=974] We have a booklet entitled Closer Walk to Help You Achieve That Goal.
[time=978] It is a daily Bible study guide that will take you through the New Testament in just 12 months.
[time=984] We're approaching the end of the year and the beginning of a new year in a matter of days.
[time=990] If you're right to us, we'll get this into your hands as quickly as we can so that you can make it your practice
[time=996] to begin this new year studying God's Word on a daily basis.
[time=1000] If you would like a copy of Closer Walk, we'll send it to you free as a gift from us to you
[time=1006] if you'll simply write and ask for it.
[time=1008] You can receive Closer Walk by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1020] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1028] Thank you, Peter. Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=1032] And I want to thank the Colby family, the quals, and the hawksers for coming in early, and we wish you all very Merry Christmas.
[time=1056] With our parents, no need to mourn.
[time=1064] His hand is stretched out still, or unto us.
[time=1074] The child is born, his promise too, to forgive.
[time=1090] To lose him, he cried for you.
[time=1104] He did not come to you in vain.
[time=1116] His long arms are open wide for you.
[time=1132] And he will come, he will come again.
[time=1144] That love has gone, is more than just a memory, for the child that was born there, has come to set us free.
[time=1172] That love has gone, I can see him in your arms, for the child that was born there.
[time=1194] His spirit never days.
[time=1204] He will come again, he will come again.
[time=1230] That love has gone, I can see him in your arms, for the child that was born there.
[time=1256] He is more than just a memory, the child that was born there, has come to set us free.
[time=1278] That love has gone, I can see him in your arms, for the child that was born there.
[time=1300] He is the King of Kids, and the Lord of Gods, and he will come again.
[time=1330] When of Majesty, in Bethlehem's morning, a child who was born there was King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and he will come again.
[time=1348] Thank you, Jenny. Would you bow as we pray together?
[time=1352] Father, it was the most majestic moment that ever dawned the surface of the earth.
[time=1360] Yet it was hidden in the obscurity of a world that was filled with apathy and indifference.
[time=1368] We are precariously, dangerously close to being as equally unconcerned.
[time=1376] God, we ask you this morning to jolt us, to give us the proverbial whack on the side of the head.
[time=1384] Don't allow this just to be another Christmas morning. Don't allow this to be another holiday where we dust off the hymns of kings and of mangers and of shepherds.
[time=1396] Father, make it today real. Help us to be people of conclusive decision. Help us today to either say that it's myth or it's God.
[time=1412] Don't allow us to be casual. Seize our attention. Make us uncomfortable.
[time=1420] Disturb us like you disturbed Herod when he heard the news and speak to our hearts.
[time=1430] We need you to convince us and to convict us that there is more than history here.
[time=1438] And so we open up our hearts and our soul to you, and we want to be vulnerable in these moments.
[time=1446] We want you to reorient the priorities of our life.
[time=1452] And we're willing to ask you to do that around the person of Jesus because we believe that he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=1460] We've come in these moments, Lord, to give you our worship. And we sense our own unworthiness and ask your forgiveness for a week that has been marked and punctuated with sin.
[time=1472] We cry out with David creating me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[time=1480] So we ask your forgiveness, and we seek your face. Please now then accept the gift of worship, the praise of our lips, the adoration of our heart.
[time=1492] God, we also gather selfishly because our burdens are heavy. And you've said that your yoke was easy and your burden was light, and we've come to ask you to shoulder the hurts of our lives.
[time=1506] We'd pray this morning for Ken Pettit that you would encourage him today to find joy in life when he has said goodbye to his life's partner.
[time=1516] We'd pray today for Stan Colburn that you would give him peace as he today mourns the loss of his father, Steve Loniger, and the death of his grandmother.
[time=1528] We'd pray that you would give strength to Harry Bennett as he tries to regain his own strength after the amputation of a leg.
[time=1538] We pray for Viola High as she faces the same surgery that you'll give her courage that you'll bring her through this whole ordeal.
[time=1548] We pray for little Amy Moore, that you would bring about a miraculous recovery in her body.
[time=1556] We pray for Marv Degas, that you'll fight with him as he battles discouragement that will not sense for a moment that he's alone.
[time=1564] God, I want to thank you for my health, the health of my family.
[time=1570] What a gift that I take for granted. Thank you for this church, not the building, the people, Lord.
[time=1576] I love to see their faces. You've encouraged me by their presence here today.
[time=1582] I hope that we please you. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1590] It was a cold, snowy morning. Blowing on your hands wouldn't really warm them.
[time=1596] It was the type of morning that when the mist came out of your nose as you exhale, it would freeze a man's mustache right there to his upper lip.
[time=1606] It was one of those mornings that when you walked across the snow, you could hear the snow creak against the frozen surface of the earth below it.
[time=1614] It was the type of morning that men didn't go out if they didn't have to in 1809.
[time=1620] But two men crossed the open field about a hundred feet apart.
[time=1624] They recognized each other in one wave and the other motioned back.
[time=1628] One had been gone for some time and yelled out, "Anything new in town?" They said, "Nah, nothing ever happens in these parts."
[time=1638] Then he remembered, "Oh yeah, one thing happened.
[time=1642] Tom Lincoln's wife had a baby. Here tell they named him Abraham."
[time=1648] And they parted.
[time=1650] Not much happens in these parts.
[time=1654] But on February the 12th, 1809, the greatest statesman in US history was born in an obscure village
[time=1662] in the backwoods of Kentucky.
[time=1664] The world didn't notice.
[time=1666] It remained unaltered and unchanged.
[time=1670] Yet as magnanimous and as event as that was in US history, it was rather incidental in the pages of time
[time=1678] compared to the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1682] But it was greeted with equal indifference.
[time=1684] It was greeted with the same apathy as a watching world only noted the movements of Herod the King
[time=1690] and of Augustus the Caesar out of Rome.
[time=1694] No one noticed that a baby boy was born in an obscure town called Bethlehem.
[time=1700] Out of the pages of the Gospel according to Matthew, we meet three different individuals,
[time=1706] our groups of individuals who observe the birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=1712] These three individuals or groups of individuals gave three completely different reactions.
[time=1718] The first was Herod, the puppet king of Rome.
[time=1720] His reaction was that of anger.
[time=1724] What do you mean there was one born king of the Jews?
[time=1726] Herod's heart would beat fast as he would say.
[time=1730] I am the king of the Jews.
[time=1732] There would be the scribes, the local religious leaders of the day.
[time=1738] In the middle of the news that there was born one king of the Jews would let out a yawn.
[time=1744] A timeless sigh of apathy.
[time=1748] And with their academic minds they could point to the place in Micah
[time=1754] where it was foretold that he would be born in Bethlehem.
[time=1758] But only their fingers moved across the pages of a scroll.
[time=1760] Their lives would not move from their comfort to examine the claims that Jesus was born.
[time=1768] A third group were people called the Magi, foreigners who came from a far country.
[time=1774] They were not angry like Herod.
[time=1776] They were not apathetic like the scribes.
[time=1780] They were the ones who were accepting of the news of the Messiah.
[time=1784] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open at the Matthew chapter 2 and I would like to read for us the first twelve verses that tell us about these three groups of people and their three reactions.
[time=1796] After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod,
[time=1804] Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews?" We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.
[time=1818] When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed and all Jerusalem with him.
[time=1828] When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law,
[time=1834] he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
[time=1838] In Bethlehem in Judea they replied, "For this is what the prophet has written.
[time=1846] But you, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are by no means the least of the rulers of Judah.
[time=1852] Out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel."
[time=1858] Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
[time=1868] He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child.
[time=1874] As soon as you find him, report to me so that I too may worship him."
[time=1882] After they had heard the king, they went on their way.
[time=1886] The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
[time=1894] When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
[time=1898] On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary and they bowed down and worshiped him.
[time=1908] Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, of incense and of myrrh.
[time=1916] And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
[time=1924] Three individuals, or groups of individuals, and three completely different responses to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1934] The first individual was Herod, and we gave our entire message last week over to the study of this personality.
[time=1942] Herod was not a Jew. He was an Idumian. He came from the land just across the Jordan.
[time=1948] He was not a descendant of Jacob, but he was a descendant of Esau.
[time=1954] He was a puppet at the end of Rome's strings.
[time=1958] Herod had been propped up because he was a yes man for Rome and for Caesar.
[time=1964] He did what he was told and he executed his orders well.
[time=1968] When he heard this phrase, "Where is he that is born?"
[time=1974] King of the Jews, the Bible tells us that he was immediately disturbed.
[time=1978] He became so disturbed and filled with anger that he set out to eliminate the baby Jesus.
[time=1986] Herod had killed one wife, three sons, and a multitude of rivals.
[time=1992] He was a man who Caesar spoke of with these remarks.
[time=1996] It is safer to be Herod's pig than it is to be Herod's son. You'll live longer.
[time=2002] He was an angry man who was threatened by the birth of Christ, and in his hostility would think of nothing
[time=2010] to eliminate a whole province full of baby boys.
[time=2016] His response was that of anger.
[time=2020] That's by way of review. Allow me to point your attention to a whole new group of people today.
[time=2026] They're found in verse 4. They only make a passing message, but their message is indicting of their own lives.
[time=2034] It says when he, Herod, had called together the people's chief priests and the teachers of the law,
[time=2040] he asked them where Christ was to be born.
[time=2044] Here we're introduced to a second group of people. They bear these titles, chief priests and teachers of the law.
[time=2052] Allow me to teach you just a little history today. I don't want to live history.
[time=2056] We won't need to make application, but a little history may help.
[time=2062] In the Old Testament, God had never appointed chief priests.
[time=2066] He had appointed a high priest. Aaron was the first high priest.
[time=2072] And there was to be a high priest over the land of Israel who was a descendant of Aaron who would serve for a lifetime.
[time=2080] And he was to be a representative of the people spiritually before God.
[time=2086] That's what it was supposed to be, a descendant of Aaron for a lifetime in a spiritual leadership.
[time=2094] Here's what it became. It became an appointed position appointed by Rome or by Herod.
[time=2102] It was an appointment made out of political expediency.
[time=2106] Now listen, if you can keep your section of the community quiet and in loyalty to me,
[time=2112] then at the end of this year I'll point you the next high priest.
[time=2116] And so if the man played out his cards of favoritism to Rome, he might receive the appointment of high priest.
[time=2122] But then it was this crowd that acted up. And so behind this guy's back, if you can muster support for me,
[time=2130] you know, things will really go well for you. How does the title high priest sound to you?
[time=2138] And so in a moment Rome would depose this one and raise this one up.
[time=2144] And then this individual came along and said, you know, my family's got a lot of money.
[time=2150] A lot of money. But what we've always wanted was a priest in our family, a high priest to be preferable.
[time=2158] And in the time that Jesus was born, the position of high priest was gone,
[time=2164] bought and sold to the highest bidder on more than one occasion.
[time=2168] And instead of there being one high priest for a lifetime, there was that ex-high priest.
[time=2174] That ex-high priest, this high priest who's about to become an ex-high priest in a matter of days.
[time=2180] And they all retained the title. So there were many people who had the title of high priest.
[time=2186] Just like we today have more than one person who we would call president.
[time=2190] George Bush is our president, but we would still call Mr. Reagan, President Reagan,
[time=2196] Mr. Carter, President Carter, because they formally held that position.
[time=2200] And though they've left the office, they do not necessarily have to drop the title.
[time=2206] So there are a number of people whose jobs are to be spiritual leaders
[time=2212] who are nothing more than political cronies to Herod who hold down the religious office of distinction.
[time=2218] Coupled with them were a group of people who are called the teachers of the law or the scribes.
[time=2226] The scribes had an exact responsibility. They were the keepers of the law.
[time=2232] This was in the pre-Zerok days. So if you wanted a copy of the Bible,
[time=2238] you didn't go to the local printer and say, "Make me a copy." You went to the scribes and they made you a copy by hand.
[time=2248] And they were the only ones allowed to do this.
[time=2250] And they approached their job with a meticulous mind of an accountant.
[time=2256] They took track of every page that they wrote.
[time=2260] They counted every word on the page and they would count every letter in the words.
[time=2266] So a meticulous scribe would look and he would look at the original and count the letters.
[time=2272] Then he'd go to his copy and he'd count the letters.
[time=2274] If he dropped his pen or ceremonially defiled it in any way, he discarded it.
[time=2282] The chief priests were the religious liberals of the day.
[time=2286] The scribes were the religious hyper-conservative of the day.
[time=2292] As they worked with the law, they worked with a book that pointed singularly to the Messiah.
[time=2302] Whenever a scribe would copy the prophets, he would write down hundreds of prophecies about the coming Messiah.
[time=2310] When he would write down the books of the law, he would go through an exact process of a sacrificial system
[time=2318] that was only meant to point ultimately to the Messiah.
[time=2322] Everything that that person did was directed ultimately for the purpose at pointing at the Messiah.
[time=2332] And the tragedy of their life is that they had given their lives over to discovering all that they could about the Messiah.
[time=2340] And when the Messiah came, they slept right through it.
[time=2346] One of the dumbest days of my life, and I say one of them because there are many that are rivals for that position.
[time=2352] But one of the dumbest days of my life was when I was a seminary student.
[time=2358] I was going to Talbot Seminary in Los Angeles, California, working as a youth pastor, and somebody came up with the idea
[time=2364] that we ought to take our youth group to the rose parade.
[time=2366] Sounds like a good idea.
[time=2368] Then they sprang on me that you don't go to the rose parade on New Year's Morning, you go on New Year's Eve Day.
[time=2376] And you camp out on Colorado Boulevard overnight.
[time=2380] So I'm bouncing this busload of high school kids through LA, and we get to Colorado Boulevard about five o'clock the night before.
[time=2388] There's already a lot of people gathered here, but we got prime seats, front row, curbside.
[time=2396] And we sat on the curb from five until four in the morning, waiting for the rose parade to come.
[time=2404] When four in the morning came, I had had it.
[time=2408] I didn't care what came down that street.
[time=2410] And I said, I'm just going to go lay down in the bus for a little bit.
[time=2414] Between four in the morning and noon, an earthquake hit Pasadena.
[time=2422] I slept through it.
[time=2424] The rose parade began, started, and passed when I came out of the bus waiting for the parade.
[time=2432] A whole event was to go to the rose parade, and I slept through an earthquake in the entire rose parade.
[time=2440] I know how these scribes felt.
[time=2442] They'd given their whole life to say, the Messiah's coming is going to be born in Bethlehem, going to be born in the line of David, going to be born of a virgin.
[time=2448] Stars are going to come out of Jacob, and all that happened. You know what? They slept through all of it.
[time=2454] They miss their entire mission in life.
[time=2462] You know, that's not a rarity.
[time=2464] It's not unusual for us to miss our entire mission in life.
[time=2470] Herod was a man whose reaction to the birth of Christ was that of anger.
[time=2476] He's the rare one. The typical one are the scribes who missed their whole mission in life because of apathy.
[time=2484] They'd become too involved with affairs of states and the rising of a high priest in the bringing down of another.
[time=2492] They'd become too involved in self-interest, and they missed their whole mission in life.
[time=2500] Here were the people that had all of the facts and absolutely none of the answers.
[time=2506] When Herod came to them and asked them where is he to be born, they instantly knew. They had all the information, but they didn't have the answer.
[time=2518] In many ways, we are a generation of scribes because we have all of the information, but many of us don't have the answer.
[time=2528] If you went not only within the walls of this church, but in this community, and you said, "Where was Jesus born?"
[time=2536] The average person could tell. Bethlehem. Who was his mother? Mary.
[time=2540] Who came to visit him? A shepherd's angel, some wise men, a few donkeys, camels, and an ox.
[time=2546] And last time I saw the manger scene, we are academically informed.
[time=2552] We have the information, but we don't have the answer.
[time=2558] It points to the greatest dilemma. It's not the dilemma of the mind. It's the dilemma of the heart.
[time=2564] I'm sure this is not true, but it's good telling.
[time=2568] That a man went door to door taking a survey and said, "What do you think is the greatest problem in America?"
[time=2574] Apathy are ignorance. And the man said, "I don't know, and frankly, I don't care."
[time=2582] We are living in a land where the attitude is not angry. It's indifference. We really don't care.
[time=2592] Fortunately, there is a third group of people here.
[time=2596] These mysterious men are called magi. A great deal of legend and tradition has grown up about these men.
[time=2604] We believe an awful lot about them that we simply don't know that's true. Let me tell you some of the legends,
[time=2612] and none of these can be substantiated. First of all, we don't even know that there were three of them.
[time=2618] Do you ever notice that? There's nowhere in the Bible that it says, "We three." We assume there were three because there were three gifts, but one of them may have been generous and brought two gifts.
[time=2628] It may have been a dozen of them. In fact, the earlier tradition says that there weren't three, but there were 12 wise men who came.
[time=2638] The Bible says nothing about them being kings.
[time=2642] We sang this morning, "We three kings of Orient are," but there's really not anything in the pages of the New Testament to suggest that they were kings.
[time=2650] Now, in the Old Testament in the book of Isaiah, it talks about the Messiah being worshipped by kings,
[time=2656] but we don't know that these are the guys that Isaiah was talking about.
[time=2660] We don't even know that Isaiah was talking about Christ when he came as a baby versus Christ when he comes again in his glory.
[time=2668] Just tradition. Well, legends can go even further.
[time=2672] Legend says that there were three of them, and their names were Kaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar.
[time=2678] The tradition even goes further to say that Kaspar was not the friendly ghost, but this Kaspar was the youngest of the three,
[time=2688] and he is the one that brought the frankincense.
[time=2690] Melchior was the oldest of the three and had a long beard, and he is the one that brought the gold.
[time=2698] And Balthasar was a black man, and now we can say that these three men were direct descendants of Noah's three sons, Shem, Ham, and Seth,
[time=2708] which we don't have any reason in the world to believe, but it's just tradition that pops up again.
[time=2714] There's another tradition that their bodies were secretly preserved and mummified and buried in a cathedral in Europe,
[time=2722] and we now have exhumed these mummies and their skulls on display in the Cathedral of Cologne.
[time=2730] Now, if you believe those skulls are the three wise men, and if you'd like to see me afterwards,
[time=2738] I've got a good lead on some property in Florida that I'd like to sell you after church as well.
[time=2742] It's all myth, and it's all tradition.
[time=2746] But don't allow that to confuse you because there are some things that we know that are factual and true.
[time=2754] Let me tell you what we do know about these men.
[time=2756] First of all, we know that they are called magi.
[time=2760] It sounds suspiciously like the word magician, doesn't it?
[time=2764] There's a reason. It's the same word.
[time=2766] Now, when you hear the word magi in this historical context, please don't picture somebody pulling a rabbit out of a hat or a hat out of a rabbit.
[time=2776] The word magi is an old word that probably comes to us from the land of the Medes and the Persians, present day Iraq and Iran.
[time=2788] The magi were the elite of their country.
[time=2794] In about the fifth and sixth century before the birth of Christ, the magi were the most educated scholars of the day.
[time=2802] They were often called wise men, and that's why we call the magi wise men in this context.
[time=2810] They were educated in every possible discipline.
[time=2814] They were doctors of sorts.
[time=2816] They were astronomers and astrologers.
[time=2820] They were people who had been highly educated in natural sciences.
[time=2824] They were people who were excellent in grammar and had studied multiple languages.
[time=2830] They probably were well equipped for this trip.
[time=2834] They not only spoke their native Persian tongue, but probably knew the language of the Greeks, the Latin, and even the Hebrews.
[time=2842] It's only our society that puts such a low emphasis on languages.
[time=2846] In fact, there's an old story that's told that an individual who speaks more than two languages is called polylinguistic.
[time=2854] Someone who speaks two languages is bilingual.
[time=2856] Someone who speaks one language is an American.
[time=2860] Well, these magi's were not Americans.
[time=2862] They would have been educated in languages around the world.
[time=2866] They were literally scholars.
[time=2868] Now, we don't know the names of these three magi.
[time=2872] I'm suspicious that they weren't Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar.
[time=2876] But we do know the name of four other magi who lived hundreds of years before them.
[time=2882] Their names were Shadrach, Meshach, Abendigo, and Daniel.
[time=2888] Remember those four names, Shadrach, Meshach, Abendigo, and Daniel?
[time=2892] They were Hebrew boys who were deported to the land of the Medes and the Persians.
[time=2898] There they were selected because of their academic ability and they were trained in the wisdom of the Caledians.
[time=2906] Those were the magi.
[time=2908] Now, 400 to 500 years later, that same school of thought springs a new generation of scholars.
[time=2916] And of wise men.
[time=2918] And they are astronomers and are observing the stars.
[time=2924] The first thing we know about these magi is that they were wise men.
[time=2930] The second thing we know about them is that they came from the east.
[time=2934] That fits what we know of the word magi.
[time=2938] It comes from the land of Persia.
[time=2940] And it's probably best to assume that these men did come from the Tydrus Euphrates Valley of Mesopotamia.
[time=2946] They had a star that appeared to them when they were in the east and guided them from the east to the west that brought them to Israel.
[time=2956] The third thing we know about these men is that they brought gifts.
[time=2960] Gold, frankincense, which is something that would be used in the temple, sweet smelling perfume, and mer.
[time=2970] A scent that would be surpy and sticky that would be used primarily in involving a body.
[time=2978] The final thing that we know about these men for certain is that they followed a star.
[time=2986] Now, this has prompted as much speculation as the magi.
[time=2990] Astronomers have studied the history of the stars and have come to some very interesting observations that we know to be true.
[time=3000] One thing we know to be true is that in 11 BC, Hallease Comet appeared and would have been visible in the Middle East.
[time=3008] So one theory is this.
[time=3010] These magi, these astronomers are sitting on top of their roofs and they're noticing the position of the north star.
[time=3016] And they're trying to see if Jupiter is going to come out tonight.
[time=3020] And all of a sudden, whoosh, Hallease Comet zips across the sky.
[time=3026] And they say, wow, let's see where it went.
[time=3030] And they begin to pursue Hallease Comet.
[time=3032] That's a possible theory.
[time=3034] Another point that the history of astrology has made is that these men watched the stars and they would have been alarmed by anything that appeared in the stars.
[time=3046] And in the year 5 BC, Cirrus, the dog star, was visible very early in the morning.
[time=3056] It seemed to rise with the sun.
[time=3058] And not only did it rise with the sun, but it occurred in the month of Messior, the Egyptian month, which means birth of a prince.
[time=3068] So some think, well, this star appeared in the morning, the magi saw it and it came in the month that was titled Birth of the Prince.
[time=3076] Possible theory.
[time=3078] Another possibility is that in the year 7 BC, Jupiter and Saturn lined up with each other and their auroras blended together and it would have made an extremely bright constellation for a brief period of time.
[time=3094] Well, that's rather interesting. I tend to think that it's nothing more than some history that's coincidental.
[time=3100] This star, I think, can be clearly shown was not Hallease Comet, was not the dog star, was not a planet.
[time=3108] It's a most unusual star.
[time=3110] If you'll track the star as its pattern is left in the stardust of Matthew chapter 2, we find this.
[time=3120] First, the star appears in the east and it guides them in a direction to bring them to Israel.
[time=3128] Then the star disappears as mysteriously as it originally appeared.
[time=3134] It's gone.
[time=3136] They said past tense, we saw his star, but when Herod and they dialogued, the star was gone.
[time=3142] Then when they left Herod, they started in the direction of Bethlehem. That same identical star reappears.
[time=3152] Now, to do a little speculative thinking that I believe is accurate, when they were in the land of Persia and they saw a star that directed them to the east, that would have been a very high flying star to bring them to a horizon 500 miles away.
[time=3168] Now, the star reoccurs when they're in Jerusalem and leads them to Bethlehem, which is only five miles away.
[time=3176] That star would have to be perched very low on the horizon for them to be able to observe its movement and that actually came to a stop over the manger where Christ was positioned.
[time=3190] So what we have is God bringing a star, not Halley's Comet, not Jupiter, but a star that would significantly change the astronomy patterns of the sky to bring the wise men exactly where he wanted them to be.
[time=3210] And I believe that fits perfectly with Numbers chapter 24 where God said a star would arise out of Jacob and that became the expected sign of the Messiah.
[time=3222] These wise men are unlike Herod in his anger, unlike the scribes in their apathy. They are accepting of a sign from God and move forward in full faith with full force.
[time=3238] A century ago, a good Bible writer penned these words. Speaking of the magi, he said, "They believed in Christ when they had never seen him, but that was not all.
[time=3248] They believed in him when the scribes and the Pharisees were unbelieving, but that was not all.
[time=3256] They believed in him when they saw him a little infant on Mary's knee and worshiped him as king.
[time=3262] This was the crowning point of their faith. They saw no miracles to convince them. They heard no teaching to persuade them.
[time=3270] They beheld no signs of divinity and greatness to over all of them. They saw nothing but a newborn infant, helpless and weak, and needing a mother's care like any one of ourselves.
[time=3284] And yet when they saw that infant, they believed that they saw the divine Savior of the world and they worshiped him.
[time=3296] More than anything else, the magi serve as a great example to us of Jesus' words, "Seek, and you shall find.
[time=3308] Knock, and the door shall be opened unto you. Ask, and it shall be given."
[time=3316] You see, we hold in the pages of the Scripture all the information we ever need, but if you're not a seeker, you won't find.
[time=3322] If you're not asking, you won't hear an answer. And if you're not knocking and aggressive in your search, there'll be nothing at the other side of the door.
[time=3332] These wise men were wisest of all, not because of their mastery of the movement of the stars or of language, but because they had mastered the spiritual appetite of hungering after God.
[time=3346] They brought him three gifts. Another tradition says that that's where we get our habit of giving Christmas gifts to each other because the magi gave gifts to the Lord.
[time=3358] I like giving gifts. One of the traditions is to keep what we give a secret.
[time=3362] With that in mind, my sons end to me last year. Daddy, you don't know what color the suspenders we bought you are.
[time=3370] I'd like to ask you for a gift, not for me, of course, but for the Lord. It doesn't need to be a secret.
[time=3380] Years ago, biblical scholars made this astute observation that the gifts that were given were rather symbolic. Gift for a king?
[time=3390] What would you give a king? Gold. Gift of frankincense, to whom would you give that? To a priest? Gift of myrrh.
[time=3398] To whom would you give that? You would give that to one about to die.
[time=3404] And so the author, John Hopkins of wy three kings, penned these words. Born a king on Bethlehem's plane, gold I bring to crown him again.
[time=3414] King forever, ceasing never, overall to reign. Frankincense, to offer, have I, incense owns a deity nigh, prayer and praising, all men raising, worshiping God on high.
[time=3430] Mer is mine, bitter for prune, breathes of a life, gathering gloom, sorrow, sighing, bleeding dying, sealed in the stone, cold tomb.
[time=3444] The wise men brought their three gifts. If you believe Jesus is king, then I believe we owe him the gift of submission.
[time=3454] If you believe Jesus is our ultimate high priest, then we owe him the gift of our worship. If we believe Jesus is the one who died for us, we owe him the gift of our life.
[time=3466] Our God.
[time=3472] We've been sharing with you on this special Christmas Sunday morning music from celebration, our hand bell choir, and soloist Jenny Clancy. The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3484] If as a result of this program you've made a decision to trust the Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3492] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to be born, to die on the cross for my sins, and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3504] I ask you to forgive me of my sins and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3512] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3526] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the devotional guide "Closer Walk", please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
