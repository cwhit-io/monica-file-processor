[time=78] Almost 2,000 years ago, a group of shepherds came to Bethlehem.
[time=83] They're in a stable. They came face to face with a little child.
[time=88] That child was the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that they went away praising him,
[time=94] worshiping him, and testifying to all about the great thing that they had seen.
[time=99] He transformed their lives. He changed them.
[time=103] This Christmas season, we all come face to face again with Jesus Christ.
[time=109] We may read it in the words of Scripture. We may hear the sermon preached,
[time=115] but all of us must make a decision.
[time=118] Will we allow ourselves like the shepherds to be transformed into worshiping, praising Christians?
[time=126] Or will we take the story, close our Bibles, and put it back on the shelf,
[time=133] and turn our back on Christ for one more year?
[time=137] [MUSIC]
[time=149] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=153] Thank you for joining us. Our message today is from Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=158] Jim's message is entitled "The Extraordinary Story of an Extraordinary Savior."
[time=164] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=168] Our text is taken from the Book of Luke, who will be looking at chapter two, verses one through twenty.
[time=176] Special music today includes a song from Reflection and a solo from Lisa Reniker.
[time=184] We now join our service with a duet from Marilyn Wong and Ed Richard, along with a Living Christmas Tree Choir.
[time=192] [MUSIC - 564 seconds]
[time=760] [APPLAUSE - 4 seconds]
[time=768] What a privilege it is to use the vehicle of music to proclaim the birth of our Savior and to make his praise glorious. I'm so thankful for the heritage that I have of knowing Jesus is my savior at an early age and being able year after year to just recognize the birth of our Savior at this time. Hark the herald angels sing glory to the newborn king, 133.
[time=792] Him number 133. Sing it together with me.
[time=796] [MUSIC - 358 seconds]
[time=1158] right here in our sanctuary. We wish you a very Merry Christmas and a joyous new year.
[time=1164] We trust it'll be a great year for you and we'll go back now to our live service.
[time=1188] We wish you a very Merry Christmas and a joyous new year.
[time=1360] (Applause)
[time=1368] Our Father, we just come to you now in prayer.
[time=1371] Praising you for this wonderful day.
[time=1374] All of us today are contemplating that marvelous truth that your Son came to earth.
[time=1381] God manifested in the flesh.
[time=1383] God with us Emmanuel on that first Christmas.
[time=1387] We praise you.
[time=1388] We are just an awesome wonder of that great event.
[time=1392] But Father, this morning as we come to you in prayer, we would want to pray especially for the mother of Karyn Sikafus and our church who had a heart attack this morning.
[time=1404] We would ask your blessing and we would ask that you would be with the family and that you would bring complete healing to her body.
[time=1411] Father, we would just thank you for successful surgery for Viola High in the removal of a leg.
[time=1417] We would praise you and thank you that an artificial limb can be applied and that she will be back walking and hopefully pain free very soon.
[time=1426] Father, we pray for Lorraine Summers this week as she goes through a surgical procedure on Friday.
[time=1433] Lord, she has struggled so much and gone through so much during this time of pregnancy and now in this time of follow-up treatment.
[time=1440] We would just pray that the healing would be complete, that you would give wonder, skill and wisdom to the doctors involved.
[time=1448] And then lastly, Father, this morning we would come in prayer for young Amy Moore.
[time=1453] Lord, she lies paralyzed in the bed in Indianapolis.
[time=1458] We praise you for her life and for her commitment to you, but at this time we just pray and come to you begging that you might intervene.
[time=1466] Lord, we praise you for the strength that you have given to Wayne and to Debbie, but Lord, we would pray that you would heal Debbie, that you would heal Amy, raise her up and bring her back to us as soon as possible.
[time=1478] But now as we will prepare in a few moments to study the Word, we just ask that you would continue to meet with us in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1496] Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, so daughter of Zion.
[time=1508] Be sure to come to thee for unto us the child is born unto us,
[time=1526] the son is given unto us, the son is given for unto us the child is born.
[time=1536] A wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace,
[time=1546] the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace on earth and mercy mile,
[time=1554] God and sinners crack and saw, heart the hell, angels sing, glory to the new man.
[time=1567] King of kings and Lord of lords, King of kings and Lord of lords, Lord of lords.
[time=1579] Joy to the world, the Lord is gone, and mercy for him.
[time=1587] Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
[time=1613] Our Father, we pause again for just a brief moment to ask your blessing upon
[time=1627] the preaching of the Word. We ask that you would speak through me, but I would most of all pray that as we celebrate the birth of your wonderful son, our Savior, that no one would leave today who doesn't know him as Savior and Lord in Christ's name, amen.
[time=1646] The Air Florida jetliner took off from Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C.
[time=1653] It became immediately evident that the plane wasn't going to get off the ground.
[time=1658] As it began to climb, it was losing airspeed, and as it lost airspeed, the plane instead of going up began to come down.
[time=1666] As the control tower watched and as people in their cars on the highway next to the airport, cringed in horror, the airplane came crashing down into the Potomac River.
[time=1678] The people got out of their cars, they ran to the edge of the Potomac River, and from the shore they watched as people tried to get out of the plane to fight for their life.
[time=1689] National television captured the moment when a young flight attendant, a young girl,
[time=1695] flailing in the water, trying to save herself from the icy water that she was in, was struggling.
[time=1703] It looked as if she would go under for the last time.
[time=1706] One man on the shore, watching, decided.
[time=1709] There was no time to wait for emergency personnel to come.
[time=1712] He had to do something.
[time=1714] Lenny Skutten had dived into the water, and in that murky cold, swam out to that young girl,
[time=1721] wrapped a strong arm around her, and with her neck and head in one arm, he swam to shore with the other.
[time=1729] When that tape played on national television, he became an instant hero in America.
[time=1734] He was hailed as a savior.
[time=1736] He had saved the life of this young girl who would certainly have perished without his heroic action.
[time=1743] Yes, he was a savior.
[time=1746] During the 1980s, we have had many saviors in America.
[time=1750] There was Lenny Skuttnik, who saved the life of this young girl.
[time=1754] In the world of business, there was Lee Iacocca, who took over at Chrysler Corporation, and was hailed as a savior when a few years later he brought them back to the brink of financial prosperity.
[time=1767] Yes, in America, we have many saviors.
[time=1771] An athlete dives into the hole at shortstop and spears a line drive in the last game of the World Series,
[time=1777] and we say, "He saved the game." He saved the World Series.
[time=1782] Oh, all of these people are heroes.
[time=1785] They're saviors, but they're just ordinary men.
[time=1789] Just ordinary men.
[time=1792] And although their feats are great, and they have done great things in their heroism,
[time=1799] their feats pale when they come in contact face-to-face with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=1808] For this morning, we celebrate the birth of the one who came down from heaven
[time=1815] for the purpose of saving all of mankind, not just one man or one company or one game,
[time=1823] but all of mankind from its sin.
[time=1827] He came to give his life on the cross that you and I might have everlasting life.
[time=1836] Yes, this morning we want to study the extraordinary birth of an extraordinary Savior.
[time=1844] If you're here this morning and you have your Bible with you, I highly encourage you to turn with me to Luke chapter 2.
[time=1850] I want to read this beautiful story of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1855] If you are visiting with us at Blackhawk this morning and you didn't think to bring a Bible with you, if you have one, would you lean over and let them read with you so that everyone might join as we read this beautiful narration of the birth of our Lord.
[time=1869] Luke chapter 2 beginning with verse 1.
[time=1873] In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken
[time=1879] of the entire Roman world.
[time=1882] This was the first census that took place while Quiranius was governor of Syria, and everyone went to his own town to register.
[time=1891] So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house in line of David.
[time=1901] He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him, and was expecting a child.
[time=1908] While they were there the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[time=1915] She wrapped him in strips of cloth and placed him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
[time=1922] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[time=1927] And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[time=1933] But the angels said to them, "Do not be afraid.
[time=1937] I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people." Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[time=1946] He is Christ, the Lord.
[time=1949] This will be assigned to you.
[time=1951] You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.
[time=1956] Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests." When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherd said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has told us about." So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[time=1984] And when they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child.
[time=1990] And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
[time=1995] But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[time=1999] The shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had seen, which were just as they had been told.
[time=2008] This morning as we take time to study this extraordinary birth
[time=2014] of our extraordinary Savior, I would like to project to you this morning, and I would like us to see three extraordinary aspects of this marvelous story.
[time=2027] Three extraordinary aspects to this wonderful story of the birth of our Lord.
[time=2036] The first one is found in verses one through seven, and I would like us to see first the extraordinary birth of our Savior.
[time=2044] His extraordinary birth, it's found in verses one to seven.
[time=2049] You know at first glance it looks even in this narrative as just another baby coming into the world.
[time=2056] A man and the woman who was pledged to be married to him, traveling.
[time=2061] The time came for a baby to be born, and it was born in a stable.
[time=2067] It sounds like billions of other babies who have come into the world, perhaps at that same time.
[time=2074] It doesn't sound a whole lot unlike the birth that I went through, that my mother went through for me.
[time=2081] I was just born in an ordinary hospital.
[time=2084] In an ordinary city, on an ordinary cold February day in 1952,
[time=2093] well I'm convinced that God did predestin that I would be born on February 14th, 1952 so that my mother could forever call me her little Valentine.
[time=2104] But you know it was just an ordinary birth, nothing special.
[time=2108] But if we look carefully at these seven verses, we will see the extraordinary birth of Christ.
[time=2116] For forth there was nothing ordinary, nothing ordinary about it.
[time=2120] I want to point out three things in just a brief amount of time here this morning that tell us that this birth indeed was extraordinary.
[time=2128] First of all, it was determined by God in His sovereignty to occur at this time.
[time=2135] It was determined by God that at the time that He chose for His purpose to be fulfilled,
[time=2143] Christ would be born in Bethlehem on that day.
[time=2148] In Galatians chapter 4, Paul writes, "But when the time had fully come,
[time=2154] in other words when God's plan was to be fulfilled at that time, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under law, to redeem those under the law that we might receive the full rights of sons."
[time=2170] Yes, this was the time determined by God to occur for the birth of our Savior.
[time=2177] Now you might ask the question and legitimately so, why at this time?
[time=2182] What was so special about this time?
[time=2185] I studied the time of our Lord's birth this week, and I found some marvelous truths about it.
[time=2191] God's timing is indeed always accurate.
[time=2194] Christ came at a time when the Roman Empire was very, very firmly in control of all that it had within its borders.
[time=2202] The Roman Empire was strong.
[time=2205] There was a great amount of peace and safety within the Empire.
[time=2209] It was not a time of war.
[time=2211] And it's ironic that Christ would be born not ironic, but it was predetermined that Christ would be born at this time so that those early evangelists could travel about the Roman world in peace, in safety, proclaiming the Word and planting the Word of Jesus Christ to that society.
[time=2230] Yes, it was determined by God and His sovereignty and in His wisdom.
[time=2235] The second extraordinary thing that I would like to point out about His birth today is that it was prophesied 600 years before it ever took place.
[time=2246] It was 100 years before Christ was born.
[time=2249] The prophets proclaimed, inspired by God, that it would occur at that time in the city of Bethlehem.
[time=2256] Isaiah in chapter 7, Isaiah wrote, "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and he will be called Immanuel." Oh, there's a tremendous amount in that verse, in that prophecy by Isaiah.
[time=2271] For he predicted that Christ would be born of a virgin, and he predicted that he would be called Immanuel.
[time=2277] That word means God with us.
[time=2279] And what Isaiah was prophesying 600 years before was that that child who would lay in that manger in Bethlehem would be God Himself manifested in the flesh.
[time=2290] God with us, Immanuel.
[time=2294] Micah the prophet said, "But you Bethlehem, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me, one who will be ruler over Israel." Micah predicted that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, and he was.
[time=2310] And then that classic prophecy of Isaiah, which we all know so well, it's been made into song.
[time=2315] For unto us a child is born, to us the son is given, and the government will be born, will be on his shoulders, and he will be called wonderful, counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[time=2330] Yes, it is a marvelous thing for us to see that as we study the extraordinary birth of our Lord,
[time=2337] that it was prophesied 600 years before it occurred.
[time=2341] Oh, there was nothing ordinary about the birth of Christ, nothing ordinary at all.
[time=2347] It was all extraordinarily orchestrated by God within his time and purpose,
[time=2353] and the people in the time were brought together, and Christ was born at the time that God wanted it to occur.
[time=2362] Each Christmas season, my family gathers together, and we watch that wonderful story by Dr. Seuss called the Grinch that stole Christmas. Oh, we enjoy that.
[time=2371] And one time we sit and we listen, and we listen to the who's down in Whoville, and the Grinch up on the mountain, and we watch it and we enjoy it.
[time=2379] But you know, even my three-year-old son knows that the Grinch that stole Christmas isn't real.
[time=2386] No, it's just an ordinary story. It's not true.
[time=2390] It's merely a myth, a cartoon. There's nothing true about it.
[time=2396] And every year we take the Grinch that stole Christmas, and we forget about it until the following Christmas season.
[time=2403] But this morning, as we read this narrative, the story of the birth of Christ,
[time=2409] I would challenge all of us to not consider this to be merely just another story,
[time=2416] not just another fable, not just another embellishment of someone who wrote it down 1900 years ago.
[time=2424] No, this is the inspired, true story of the birth of our Savior and our Lord, Jesus Christ.
[time=2433] It's an extraordinary story, but it's extraordinarily true.
[time=2438] And this morning, I would pray that each of us, as we come face to face with Jesus Christ again on this Christmas Sunday,
[time=2447] would come face to face with the truth that this account is true. It's extraordinary, and all of us must deal with it.
[time=2455] If we're a believer this morning, I would pray that it would make us awestruck and full of even more wonder than we have ever been before.
[time=2463] And if you're not a believer this morning, I would pray that you would see the extraordinary story that you would trust in that babe and that manger as Savior and as Lord of your life.
[time=2475] The second thing that I would like us to see this morning is found in verse 11. I would like us to see the extraordinary names,
[time=2483] the extraordinary names that were given to Jesus by that angel.
[time=2488] The angel said, "Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord."
[time=2499] Three names were given to Christ by that angel. He was called Savior, he was called Christ, he was called Lord.
[time=2510] I want to be very precise as we study these names because they're very important. Three Greek words.
[time=2516] "Soter Christos Kuryas, Savior Christ and Lord." For in these three words are found the very essence, the very person of who Jesus Christ was.
[time=2529] And I don't want us to ever be mistaken about what they were saying about our Savior.
[time=2536] Norm Crosby, the comedian, gets paid very well to make us laugh and you know that what he does, he tells a story.
[time=2543] And he intentionally injects words that don't belong in the story.
[time=2548] He usually picks a word that sounds a lot like the word that's supposed to be there, but it's the wrong one.
[time=2553] And of course we know the word that he was supposed to use and we howl with laughter because it's so funny to hear.
[time=2560] But you know the reason that we laugh is because we know what he was trying to say.
[time=2567] We know what he was trying to say and the meaning is conveyed. In his lack of precision with the English language, the message still comes across.
[time=2580] All of us on a daily basis interact with people and at times we ourselves or perhaps the people that we're talking to use a word that maybe doesn't fit in the conversation.
[time=2590] But for the most part we know what they were trying to say. It doesn't really matter. My brother, my older brother called me not too long ago and told me a story.
[time=2599] He knew that I would think it was hilarious and so he immediately got on the phone to call me and tell me about it.
[time=2604] He told me a story about the fact that he was out playing basketball one day with some other guys.
[time=2609] And one of the guys who was playing was just head and shoulders above the rest with all kinds of unbelievable basketball ability.
[time=2617] He said Jim was so remarkable about this guy was that he could use his left hand or he could use his right hand.
[time=2625] And he could use them equally as well to pass, to dribble, to shoot.
[time=2630] Oh he was twice as dangerous as anybody I've ever seen because he could use either hand so well.
[time=2636] Well they went up to him after the game and they said boy we have never seen anybody who can play ball like you.
[time=2642] You can use your left hand. You can use your right hand. You're just marvelous.
[time=2647] And he looked at them and he said yep I can use my left hand. I can use my right hand. I'm amphibious.
[time=2660] Well you know he used the wrong word but my brother and his friends knew what he was trying to say.
[time=2666] The meaning wasn't lost. I say all of that to say this. A lack of precision in our language is never correct but we all make mistakes.
[time=2676] But let there be no lack of precision in what we look at this morning as we discuss the names of our Lord for it is the key to understanding the person of Christ.
[time=2688] The first word Savior in the Greek Sotear means rescuer, deliverer.
[time=2695] And if you read through the Gospel of Luke you will find that when Luke uses the word savior he constantly points back to the Christmas event.
[time=2704] And it's obvious that Luke is saying that this baby in the manger, this baby who was born on that day was the rescuer, he was the deliverer.
[time=2713] The only one who could deliver fallen man from the state of sin that he was in and restore him to a proper relationship with God.
[time=2724] He was the rescuer, he was the deliverer, he was the savior, the only one who could be the savior of mankind.
[time=2733] He came that those of us who were condemned to death in an eternity separated from God could be restored to the fellowship of God that man once had.
[time=2744] Yes he was the savior. Second it says that he was Christ. That word means Messiah, anointed one, the chosen one of God.
[time=2755] And when we call him Christ that means that we are saying that Jesus Christ, that baby in the manger was the chosen one, the one that God chose as the agent of our salvation.
[time=2768] The one that God chose to come to earth, to be born in that manger, to live a life for all mankind and then to go to the cross of Calvary and die and shed his blood dying in our place that we might have everlasting life.
[time=2784] Yes he was the savior. He was the Messiah, the chosen one, the one chosen by God.
[time=2792] Thirdly the Bible says he was the Lord, Kuryas in the Greek. That's an interesting, interesting word.
[time=2800] This week I was studying and I came across something that I thought was fascinating.
[time=2805] It's sad that when the Greeks sat down to make that first translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into the Greek language, they came across the Hebrew word Yahweh.
[time=2819] That word means God, it means Jehovah, but it means God, deity in the highest sense.
[time=2827] When they translated Yahweh, they used the Greek word Kuryas. And it's interesting that when they did that, Luke uses that same word here when he describes Jesus Christ.
[time=2839] He said he is Kuryas, he is Lord. The impact is obvious. What he is saying is that baby in the manger is God himself manifested in the flesh, deity in the highest sense, he is God manifested in the flesh.
[time=2856] Our Savior come to earth. Oh we ask the question, what's in a name?
[time=2864] Oh it really doesn't make a difference that Scott's name is Scott and my name is Jim and Paul's name is Paul.
[time=2872] Oh they're just ordinary names. I can remember when my wife became pregnant for our oldest son Andrew.
[time=2879] It was our first child and she brought home this book, you know the book, 19,467,000 names that you can give to your baby.
[time=2888] And over the next nine months or so we went through all of those names and we decided to call him Andrew.
[time=2894] Oh it's a fine name, one of the original disciples, a great name and I'm glad we chose it. But you know it's just an ordinary name.
[time=2905] Don't ever confuse ordinary names with the extraordinary names used here that are given by the angel to our Lord.
[time=2914] He is Savior, he is Christ, he's Lord.
[time=2918] By way of application this morning I would ask those who are here today, if you don't know Christ as Savior,
[time=2928] the Bible is telling you this morning that he is the Savior, he is the only way.
[time=2935] He is Christ, he is the anointed one of God who came that we all might have everlasting life.
[time=2942] And lastly he is Lord, he is God himself, the sovereign God of the universe.
[time=2948] He is deity in the highest sense, he is Jesus Christ the Lord.
[time=2953] And I would pray that no one would leave this morning without receiving him as Savior.
[time=2960] And if you're a believer today, praise God for that.
[time=2963] But I would just pray that it would give you a new sense of wonder for this great person that came in the manger,
[time=2970] almost 2,000 years ago.
[time=2973] And then thirdly as we move along, I'd like to point out thirdly the extraordinary worship, the extraordinary worship.
[time=2982] I find this in verses 15 to 20, and when I say extraordinary worship I'm referring to the shepherds.
[time=2989] Referring to the shepherds. Read with me in verses 15 through 20, but I'll just highlight it.
[time=2996] The angel comes and speaks to the shepherds out in the field, notice what they did.
[time=3001] It says that they hurried off immediately and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[time=3008] They came face to face with Jesus Christ the Lord on that first Christmas Sunday, first Christmas day.
[time=3016] They came face to face with Jesus Christ. And the Bible tells us that their lives were totally and forever transformed.
[time=3025] They were changed. How do we know that? Read the text.
[time=3029] It says they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child.
[time=3034] They came face to face with Jesus Christ and they became the first evangelists of the New Testament.
[time=3040] They went about praising him and preaching and proclaiming his word and saying, "He's come. Messiah is here."
[time=3047] And it said that all who heard, all who heard were amazed.
[time=3054] And in their extraordinary worship it said that after they left the Savior, after they left the Savior, the shepherds returned.
[time=3064] That means they returned to their flocks in the field. They returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
[time=3076] When they left they went out and they were praising God and glorifying Him and testifying to His fact that He was the Savior.
[time=3086] You know, it's interesting, the grammar in that verse indicates that this was not just a one-time thing.
[time=3092] When it says that they were glorifying and praising God, it's speaking here of a constant, dorative, praising and worship.
[time=3100] They were worshiping God. They were praising Him. They had come face to face with the Messiah, with Christ the Lord.
[time=3110] They had believed on Him and now they worshiped Him.
[time=3119] Not too long ago my wife and I took our two boys into one of the local grocery stores.
[time=3125] And one of the things that they like to do is they like to have lunch at the grocery store with their mother on Saturday.
[time=3131] And so as soon as we got in there, Andrew and Kyle said to their mom, "Can we go and have a corn dog and a coke?" And she said, "Okay."
[time=3139] So we went up to the counter and we ordered the food and our two boys, Kyle and Drew got theirs first and they disappeared into a little restaurant area that's off of that deli.
[time=3148] And as Linda and I stood there and waited for our order to come, we heard the unmistakable shrill of hysterical laughter from about 20 adults.
[time=3160] When you have two boys like I do, that tells you immediately you better go investigate the situation.
[time=3167] My three-year-old Kyle as we went over had taken his corn dog and his hand, had climbed up onto the table where you eat, and was waving his corn dog from side to side and was saying, "Praise God! Praise God!"
[time=3190] It was one of those times when if somebody would walk up to me and say, "Aren't you Jim Pearson from Blackhawk Baptist Church?" No.
[time=3201] That's my twin brother.
[time=3204] Well, we got him off the table and got him back down and we ate our food, but oh, I take that as an illustration of the wrong kind of worship because all he was doing was drawing attention to himself.
[time=3215] He was just proud of himself because he could make people laugh and he could get up on the table and wave that corn dog and he didn't want to quit because he saw the people laughing.
[time=3226] Well, I would pray this morning as we come face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ, that if we are a believer, that it would inspire in us a new sense of worship,
[time=3243] a new feeling of awe, a new feeling of wonder, and that we would leave today and not forget about the Christ child until next year at Christmas time,
[time=3255] but that we would make our worship a daily thing, and that each day of our lives we would worship him, we would praise him,
[time=3263] we would give him all of the honor and all of the glory, but that we would do it on a daily basis each day of the year.
[time=3272] And when we had the opportunity, we would testify to him to a world that needs Christ, for he died for them too.
[time=3282] But this morning if you're here and you're not a believer, it would be my prayer that as you come face to face today with the Christ child once again,
[time=3294] that you would see that he had an extraordinary birth, that the extraordinary names by which he is called are the only ones by which you can be saved,
[time=3306] and that you would then trust him as Savior and want to be a part of the marvelous worship that the shepherds began on that night,
[time=3316] and that you might also come to Christ, receive him as Lord and Savior so that you might worship him.
[time=3324] You know often when you preach a message such as this and you proclaim Christ as the only way,
[time=3330] and you tell people that if they don't receive Christ as Savior, that the Bible teaches that they will spend eternity separated from him.
[time=3340] Many times someone comes up afterwards or in the ensuing days and says, you know Jim, I know what you said,
[time=3350] but if God loved the world so much that he gave his only begotten Son, if God loved us as he looked down from heaven so much that he sent Christ to die in our place,
[time=3362] if he is such a God of love, then I just can't imagine him sending anybody to eternity separated from him in a place that the Bible calls hell.
[time=3374] If that would be your question this morning, let me approach it perhaps from a different aspect in which I ever have before.
[time=3386] God does not send anyone to an eternity separated from him.
[time=3392] He does not decide that you will spend eternity away from me.
[time=3398] I believe that the Bible teaches and I want you to listen carefully.
[time=3401] The Bible teaches that eternity for all of us, eternity for all of us, will merely be an expanded capacity to have that which we have pursued in this life.
[time=3415] Let me repeat that.
[time=3417] I believe that the Bible teaches that eternity for all of us, no matter who we are, will merely be an expanded capacity to have that which we have pursued in this life.
[time=3430] Let me illustrate that.
[time=3432] If you are a believer today, you have been transformed by the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=3438] then I would believe that as you get up each day, you're praising him.
[time=3443] You're looking forward to coming into his presence.
[time=3446] You're looking forward to spending time with him daily in communion and in prayer.
[time=3451] You love to study his word and to listen to him teaching you through his inspired word.
[time=3458] The Christian life to you is a great adventure and you enjoy it.
[time=3463] Fanny Crosby wrote, "Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine." The next line, "Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine." If you are pursuing the things of God in this life, then when you get to eternity, it will be an expanded capacity to enjoy it all the more.

[time=3502] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3510] Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to be the Savior of the world.
[time=3517] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3521] I ask you to forgive me of my sins and be my Savior today.
[time=3526] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3530] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
