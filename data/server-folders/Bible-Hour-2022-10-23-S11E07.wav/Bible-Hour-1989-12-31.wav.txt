[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] As human beings, we have such a hard time saying I was wrong, owning up to our own mistakes.
[time=48] One Oakland, California executive reports that it is his company, when people are late they must sign in and give the reason why.
[time=56] Basically the excuse is "Frog" and when one person writes it, the next people who come late just mark "Ditto" underneath it.
[time=64] On one occasion a man came late, wrote down his reason, "My wife just had twins."
[time=70] And on the next 18 lines, you guessed it, there were all "Ditto" marks.
[time=88] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=91] Thank you for joining us.
[time=93] Rick's message today is entitled "If the Shoe Fits" to make excuses is the nature of
[time=99] every one of us.
[time=100] It is hard for us to own up to our mistakes.
[time=103] Hopefully none of us were one of the men Rick mentioned who claimed that their wife had twins.
[time=108] In today's message Rick will explore John 5 where Jesus asked a lame man, "Do you want
[time=114] to get well?" That was either the most insensitive or insightful question ever asked.
[time=119] It is also a question that the man did not answer, he only offered a lame excuse.
[time=125] Today's message may make you a bit uncomfortable, but as it is titled "If the Shoe Fits" wear
[time=131] it, we encourage you to study along with us.
[time=134] Rick's text is taken from the book of John 5 verses 1 through 14.
[time=142] Our special musical guest today is Lana Young.
[time=146] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song from the Living Christmas Tree entitled "Glory, Glory".
[time=160] Do not be afraid, I have good news for every one.
[time=186] The earth, the hand is burned this night.
[time=193] A Savior who is Christ alive.
[time=200] Glory, Glory, Glory.
[time=202] You will find Him blessed in swaddling clothes.
[time=207] And the King may know, may cry.
[time=214] Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory,
[time=224] Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory to Zion in the minus of his life.
[time=231] Glory, Glory to Zion in the minus of his life.
[time=253] Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory,
[time=273] in the minus of his life.
[time=280] Glory, Glory, Glory in the minus of his life.
[time=292] Glory in the highest of his life, Glory, Glory, Glory to Zion in the highest of his life.
[time=317] Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory to Zion.
[time=341] Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory, Glory in the highest of his life.
[time=384] Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace goodwill toward men.
[time=388] May that indeed be our message and our song and our fervent prayer for 1990.
[time=394] Joy to the world, the Lord indeed has come and we rejoice this day because of it.
[time=399] 125, please, hymn number 125.
[time=414] Glory to the world, the Lord indeed is come.
[time=426] Glory to the Lord indeed.
[time=431] Glory to the Lord indeed, glory to the Lord indeed.
[time=498] Glory to the Lord indeed is come.
[time=513] Thank you very much for joining in our worship time of singing.

[time=722] [APPLAUSE]
[time=727] Hello again and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=730] Kathy and I had the privilege of being home for the holidays last weekend, but we're doubly glad to be back here at Black Hawk and this is home.
[time=738] Peter, I hope you had a great Christmas season.
[time=740] We did, Rick.
[time=741] We were just around home with our family.
[time=743] We were fortunate to have our immediate family here.
[time=745] And we're glad you had a good time, but we do welcome you back to Fort Wayne.
[time=749] Well, we're glad to be back.
[time=751] I want to tell you one story.
[time=753] We were going to the church that I came to know Christ in.
[time=756] My brother-in-law and I and my wife and all of us were going to get up and go.
[time=760] And my sister got sick and so she was home and my wife stayed home to take care of all these little kids and my brother-in-law and I are going to church.
[time=767] Now, he's only gone to this church for the past 27 years.
[time=771] I said, "What time's it start?" and he said, "9, 15." So we got there at 9, went in and the first service had already started.
[time=778] And the next service didn't start until 10.
[time=781] So we went in, we heard the message from the first service stayed for the music, the second service, and then when it got crowded, we gave up our seats.
[time=789] Our timing was perfect.
[time=790] We came too late for the offering in the first service and we left too early for it in the second service.
[time=795] We got to go to church free.
[time=796] And you're going to double your offering today.
[time=798] Today, yes, that's exactly right.
[time=800] Well, as our year comes to an end, we want to thank you friends who have given faithfully and regularly to the Bible hour.
[time=806] I only say it in humor that I got to go to church free, but I did take some ribbing from my family when they figured that out.
[time=813] But we are deeply appreciative of those of you who have given to the Bible hour and wanted to thank you as this year draws to a close.
[time=820] This is the last day of the year and we are thankful for what God has done here in 1989.
[time=826] And we have as our guest today, Lana Young.
[time=829] Yes, Rick, we've been advertising for some time the appearance of Lana here in our church.
[time=834] She's been here several times and we do really love her and appreciate her music and her ability as a very young lady
[time=842] when she first started out.
[time=843] She's growing up to be quite a young lady now, but just really grateful that she's here again to minister for us.
[time=849] Well, you just heard her sing a few moments ago and she'll be singing again in just a few more moments.
[time=854] We hope you enjoy and appreciate her ministry of music.
[time=858] Today, being the last day of the year, we want to strongly encourage you to make a New Year's resolution for a new year and a new decade.
[time=867] And that would be to resolve, to read God's Word as the daily habit of your life.
[time=874] We want you to have a close walk with God.
[time=877] More important than that, God wants to have a close walk with you.
[time=881] And the only way that can be achieved is through the balance of our life with Bible reading and prayer.
[time=888] Through the Bible, God speaks to us.
[time=890] Through prayer, we can speak back to Him.
[time=893] We want to help you make that commitment of reading God's Word daily by offering to you one month's copy of a closer walk.
[time=903] It is a daily Bible study guide that will take you through the New Testament in one year's time.
[time=909] If you'll write to us today, we'll send you a copy and you can begin reading it and make a commitment this year.
[time=916] I will have a closer walk with God.
[time=919] You can receive this wonderful study guide by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=931] Once again, the address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=941] Thank you, Peter. A whole year has gone by, actually a whole decade has just slipped through our grasp.
[time=949] What's different in your life at the end of this year?
[time=952] What growth and progress have you made in your home, in the control of your emotions, in managing your money?
[time=960] Most importantly, in your spiritual walk.
[time=964] Well, you have a new opportunity. Let's make the most of it. I hope that you'll begin reading God's Word today and each day of this new year and new decade.
[time=974] We're going back to our morning worship service and back to the ministry of Lanny Young.
[time=978] Thank you for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=994] [MUSIC]
[time=1003] All I had to give was a broken heart, torn apart.
[time=1011] All I had to give was an empty heart and promises but in return you gave me joy.
[time=1022] But it could never be told, and in return you gave me love that was the first of all.
[time=1034] For whatever you have to give, you don't have to be a share.
[time=1042] Just come as you are, and present it in Jesus' name.
[time=1050] In return of a torn life, we'll give you life of under you.
[time=1058] In return of a raging storm, the Lord will pour your soul.
[time=1066] So whatever you have, the Lord has so much more.
[time=1074] So what you have to do?
[time=1082] Oh, if you were like me, you didn't have a lot of gold.
[time=1091] A decision of money, you didn't own what I told.
[time=1099] But I'm glad he didn't look upon the things that I had.
[time=1107] But he lost all the things he was able to give me.
[time=1115] All for it, return you gave you joy.
[time=1120] But it could never be told, and in return he'll give you love.
[time=1128] In return of a torn life, he'll give you life of under you.
[time=1142] In return of a raging storm, the Lord will pour your soul.
[time=1150] So what do you have to give?
[time=1156] Please tell me what do you have to give?
[time=1183] Our God and Father, we've come here today to make that great exchange,
[time=1196] to give you our life and our heart with its bruises and its pieces,
[time=1203] and ask you to give us the peace and the joy and the contentment
[time=1209] that's been spoken to us in this song.
[time=1212] We come today to give you our love and our worship.
[time=1215] We come today to express to you, without being ashamed, that we need you, that you are God, and we are just people.
[time=1226] Mortal, frail, sometime in a flurry of strength,
[time=1232] successful at other moments, unsuccessful, but ultimately destined to die.
[time=1240] And yet you're eternal.
[time=1242] You are timeless, you are immortal, and you are unchanging,
[time=1248] and we are all struck as we consider who you are.
[time=1252] And we humbly bring to you the gift of our praise today.
[time=1257] And even though you don't need it, we just love to tell you how great and marvelous you are.
[time=1265] We call this a worship service, Lord, and we ask you to meet with us as our invisible,
[time=1271] but most wanted guests, and to gather in the praise of our lips and the adoration of our hearts.
[time=1278] But Lord, we also come selfishly.
[time=1280] We want you to feed us from your word.
[time=1283] We want you to encourage us with your music.
[time=1286] We want you to captivate us with your spirit.
[time=1289] We want to leave here different than we came in.
[time=1292] We today want to find your grace amazing and sufficient.
[time=1298] We ask that your amazing grace would take Kring sycophus' mother through yet another open heart surgery.
[time=1306] We would ask your amazing grace to be adequate for Viola High and for Harry Bennett,
[time=1313] as they live without a leg.
[time=1315] We ask for your amazing grace to comfort the hearts of those who face a new year
[time=1321] without a loved one.
[time=1323] We ask for your amazing grace to restore the full strength in health, the rain summer's body.
[time=1330] We ask for your amazing grace to comfort the moors and give them a vision for life with Amy so disabled.
[time=1340] We ask your amazing grace to give her peace of heart and mind.
[time=1346] We ask for your grace that is so free and so amazing to keep our hearts in mind.
[time=1354] In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=1377] [MUSIC - 189 seconds]
[time=1573] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1577] Thank you.
[time=1579] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1582] Atlanta, we cannot thank you enough for so marvelously reminding us of God's amazing grace, grace that each of us needs, grace that was needed by a lame man who sat for 38 years, paralyzed of legs and of will.
[time=1598] If you have a Bible today, I invite you to open it to John chapter 5, and I'll be reading from the new international version, the first nine verses of John chapter 5.
[time=1609] Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
[time=1615] Now there is in Jerusalem near the sheep gate a pool which in Aramaic is called Bethsaida, which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
[time=1626] Here a great number of disabled people used to lie, the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.
[time=1634] One who was there had been an invalid for 38 years.
[time=1639] When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?" "Sir!" The invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.
[time=1660] While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."
[time=1666] Then Jesus said to him, "Get up.
[time=1671] Pick up your mat and walk." Once the man was cured, he picked up his mat and walked.
[time=1689] "Well, maybe I'd like one of these." "Hello, can I help you with a pair of that?" "Yes, I'd like a pair of these in black." "Certainly, let's see now.
[time=1698] By the looks of it, I would have to say we are a size nine." "No, I wear a size six, not a nine." "Yes, of course you do, dear.
[time=1708] How about this, though?
[time=1710] Let's measure your foot.
[time=1711] What do you say?" "Well, I wear a size six, just like I said." "Yes, ma'am, one size six coming right up." "I'm sick.
[time=1722] I wear a size six." "Get real.
[time=1728] Last time that lady saw six was after her fifth birthday."
[time=1734] "Here we go.
[time=1736] A pair of black pumps and size six.
[time=1739] Let's try them on." "Well, thank you.
[time=1742] Herb." "Let's take off her little shoesies here, okay." "Here we go.
[time=1749] And I think right...
[time=1751] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute." "Ma'am, I just don't think a size six is enough shoe."
[time=1762] "Well, maybe that's not a six.
[time=1765] Maybe it's been Miss Mark.
[time=1767] Why don't you go back and see if you can find one that says six?" "Six, yes ma'am.
[time=1771] I'll go up and see if I can't find another one that says six." "Where's six, where's six?
[time=1778] Maybe that's not size six is not shoe enough.
[time=1783] Well, this lady's got a much chance of getting on a size six as Roseanne Bardas wearing a size four from La Petite."
[time=1794] "Well, where in luck?
[time=1797] I've got one more pair of black shoes here and size six." "Oh, okay." "Let's try it again, Shawn." "Okay." "Okay." "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute." "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute." "Okay, let's try the other one over here." "That would a lot easier days." "Okay, let's try the other one over here." "Okay, let's try the other one over here." "That would a lot easier days." "Okay, let's try the other one over here." "Okay, let's try the other one over here." "That would a lot easier days." "Okay, let's try the other one over here." "Okay, let's try the other one over here." "There's something here that's not a size six." "Well, here, this explains it says these were made in Korea.
[time=1842] You know how small those Koreans be are.
[time=1845] Their six isn't the same as our six.
[time=1848] Now, there must be a six back there that fits a me." "Yes, I'll go see, okay?" "I'd like to take you, I don't want to listen." "Okay, six, that's just the plain little six, that's all I've ever used for."
[time=1865] "Okay, here it plays, I'll see you there." "I think we have them." "Here we go, I just hope really these are going to fit here." "Put your little toesies in there, very good." "Oh, thank you, oh, that feels so good." "Let's try here again, there we go, let's try it there." "Yes, oh, these must be a six or maybe even a six and a half." "You did very good, very good." "No, those are nine, dear." "But I wear a six." "Okay, lady, look, here's what we're going to do.
[time=1896] Just take the box, turn it upside down, that's all six.
[time=1901] You can take their six, your friends can take their six, their six is." "Lady, if the shoe fits, wear it, take the shoes, good day."
[time=1912] "And hence the origin of the phrase."
[time=1915] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1918] "That's the origin of the phrase, if the shoe fits, wear it."
[time=1924] I asked our friends to do that drama for us today because one of the hardest things in life for any of us to do
[time=1930] is to wear our own size shoe.
[time=1933] Maybe not on our feet, but in our heart.
[time=1937] There's a strange facet of the human mind that accepts or rejects information
[time=1943] not based upon its accuracy, but its acceptability to our own temperament.
[time=1949] I accept what you have to say to me if it goes down easy.
[time=1954] I'm sure that it's right.
[time=1956] If what you say to me is not what I want to hear, I'm sure there's some mistake in your logic.
[time=1961] Not very often do we like the size shoe that actually fits our foot.
[time=1967] Out of this passage in John chapter 9 comes an issue that will go down hard for some of us.
[time=1974] For some of us will say, "That's not my size, and I want to appeal to you today.
[time=1981] If the shoe fits, please wear it." In this passage we are going to be confronted with a number of biblical principles that I'll want to share with you over the next several weeks, but today just one shoe at a time.
[time=1999] In this passage we have a man who has been paralyzed from the time he was born in all likelihood,
[time=2008] but at least for the last 38 years.
[time=2012] This man has been sitting by a pool.
[time=2015] The belief of that day was this, that the water suddenly and mysteriously would be troubled.
[time=2023] They assumed that an angel came by and stirred up the water.
[time=2027] They further assumed that the first person into the water would be miraculously healed.
[time=2034] And so there was a collection of infirmed people there, blind, paralyzed, and lame.
[time=2041] This man, one of them.
[time=2044] His hope was that an angel would come by, trouble the water, and he would be the first one in, and come out healed and whole.
[time=2053] But it hadn't happened, at least for the past 38 years.
[time=2058] Jesus comes by, Jesus the Son of God, Jesus the miracle worker, and he poses this question.
[time=2068] He walks up to this lame man and he looks him in the eye and he says, "Do you want to get well?" That was either the most insensitive question or the most insightful question that has ever been asked.
[time=2088] If it wasn't insightful, it was harsh and callous and insensitive.
[time=2093] I mean, could you imagine walking up to an individual who was paralyzed, who could not walk and hadn't taken a step in 38 years and saying, "Hey, fella, you like being paralyzed?" Great, isn't it? You probably don't want to walk, do you?
[time=2109] That's heartless.
[time=2112] Was Jesus that insensitive?
[time=2116] Obviously not.
[time=2118] He was the God of all compassion, something that heartless couldn't flow past his lips.
[time=2125] Then what Jesus asked him was not insensitive, but rather insightful.
[time=2132] Jesus with his omniscient mind knew what was in his mind as well as his own mind.
[time=2141] Jesus knew that this man's legs were not the only thing paralyzed, so too was his will.
[time=2150] He asked him this probing diagnostic question, "Do you want to get well?"
[time=2160] It seems like the answer would be, "Yes, of course I do.
[time=2164] Who wouldn't want to be well?
[time=2166] Why do you think I'm sitting by this pool waiting for the angel?" Doesn't everybody want to get well?
[time=2173] Not necessarily so.
[time=2175] Sometimes we become so adjusted to our condition that we're quite happy and quite content, not to be well again.
[time=2188] Let me illustrate that from some true to life stories, but the names and the details have been changed to protect the guilty.
[time=2196] One of our leaders was working with an individual.
[time=2199] This individual had a long history of multiple problems.
[time=2203] Some of them were obvious.
[time=2205] He said to the individual, "What would it take for you to get better?"
[time=2211] The answer was a certain surgical procedure for which this individual had no resources.
[time=2219] Our leader said to this party, "I think I've got some contacts and connections.
[time=2225] If the funds were available, would you like to have the surgery?" Expecting an elated answer, he got a surprising response of, "No.
[time=2239] Why wouldn't you?" If money was available, why wouldn't you?
[time=2245] The response was this, "No, because if I was better, then people would expect too much from me."
[time=2254] Here was an individual who had calculated and decided, "I don't want to get better.
[time=2263] I'm too comfortable in this condition."
[time=2269] This lady is approaching 60.
[time=2272] She has high blood pressure, smokes, and is marginally obese.
[time=2277] To complement all that, she has a temper more active than a volcano, and her family knows it.
[time=2285] And she knows that they know it.
[time=2288] And so she is able to request anything.
[time=2291] She is able to ask for anything, and they are obliged to give it to her.
[time=2297] Unreasonable as she is, they always cave in to mom.
[time=2301] Because as soon as things don't go her way, she can become angry.
[time=2306] And she can see, and she has the mysterious ability to make the blood pressure visible on her face like a rising thermometer.
[time=2317] And as soon as they see the colors start to arrive, they all quickly say, "Oh, mom's getting upset.
[time=2324] We don't want mom to get upset." You know, anything could happen.
[time=2327] Remember what the doctor said if mom gets too upset?
[time=2329] "Okay, mom, we'll do it your way." And mom knows that she's got her grown adult children at the end of a string, and she controls it like a puppet.
[time=2342] And she does not want to get well.
[time=2346] Things are too good the way they are.
[time=2351] He is 40, and she will have that dark day this year when she turns the big 4-0.
[time=2360] The two of them are compulsive shoppers and obsessive spenders.
[time=2366] Their bank account reads zero.
[time=2370] Their checking account reads in the minus.
[time=2374] They have discovered all of the possibilities that MasterCard limits them to.
[time=2379] They have reached new vistas on their visas.
[time=2384] And they are constantly at strife with themselves in their world because of the financial pressure.
[time=2391] They first went to his parents and borrowed a little money.
[time=2394] Got out of the hole, right at the end of the tunnel.
[time=2397] And so they just spent themselves into oblivion again.
[time=2400] They went to her family and borrowed a little money.
[time=2403] There was light at the end of the tunnel, and they got out of the hole.
[time=2406] And so they spent themselves into debt again.
[time=2409] When they went back to the well, they were offered no cash, only a budget, which they accepted with great sugar in.
[time=2419] But following the budget that Father had put together, they dug themselves out of the hole, saw a light at the end of the tunnel, and spent every penny that they had.
[time=2427] They then turned to their church because their church offered a seminar on family finances.
[time=2432] There they arrived at a new budget.
[time=2434] They stuck to it with great discipline for almost four months, and they saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
[time=2439] It was at about that time that one in the lending institution sent them a letter.
[time=2443] It read like this.
[time=2444] Need a vacation?
[time=2446] Need a little extra money?
[time=2448] Need money for Christmas?
[time=2450] You're good for $5,000.
[time=2452] Application's been pre-approved.
[time=2454] Oh, they couldn't turn that down.
[time=2456] And today they are working with the consumer credit counselors.
[time=2461] But they really don't want to get better.
[time=2463] They've got their car trained.
[time=2465] They drop it into drive.
[time=2467] It heads to Glenbrook Mall.
[time=2468] That's the way life should be.
[time=2471] They don't want to get better, but they do want somebody to take away the pain and the consequences of their condition.
[time=2480] Often, we don't want to get better.
[time=2486] I remember my friend Ken Nichols when he was a counselor on our staff saying, "The majority of people that he talks to don't come in saying, "I want to change my life."
[time=2496] They simply say, "I want to change the consequences of my life."
[time=2502] Jesus keeps asking this question, "Do you want to get better?"
[time=2509] Now, if you're human right now, there are objections going off in your mind.
[time=2514] You're thinking of your situation or the situation of somebody that you care about.
[time=2518] You're saying, "Wait a minute, a hawk's your heartless." I knew that.
[time=2523] We didn't choose to be in this condition.
[time=2528] Some of you this past year have gone through the most painful thing I know of.
[time=2531] You have lost a loved one.
[time=2533] You didn't choose for them to die.
[time=2536] You're now living with the consequence of that pain.
[time=2539] Some of you were the victims in an accident.
[time=2541] You didn't say, "I think I'll go out and get in an accident this morning.
[time=2544] I hope somebody ruins me." You didn't choose that.
[time=2550] And I want to let you off the hook.
[time=2554] But I want to appeal to the others, including myself, the vast majority of us that if the shoe fits wear it.
[time=2566] Would you right now, you don't dare write because the person next to you may peak.
[time=2571] But would you right now identify the greatest controllable problem in your life?
[time=2581] Would you mentally write that down up here?
[time=2584] What is the greatest controllable problem in your life?
[time=2589] Is it overeating?
[time=2590] This is a bad time of year to bring that up.
[time=2593] Is it overspending? Why didn't you say that last month?
[time=2597] Is it an overactive temper?
[time=2600] Now I'm getting too close to home.
[time=2602] What is the greatest controllable problem in your life?
[time=2607] And now ask yourself this question, "Do I really want to get better?"
[time=2617] Jesus asked that man and us this question, "Do you want to get better?"
[time=2626] Now jump down one verse with me, if you will.
[time=2628] The question is in six, and in verse seven is the man's answer.
[time=2634] Jesus says, "Do you want to get better?" The guy doesn't say, "Yes, I'd love to get better." He doesn't say, "No." He doesn't say, "Why do you ask a question?" He does what every human being who Scott does.
[time=2648] He makes an excuse.
[time=2651] Jesus says, "Do you want to get better?" And he said, "Sir, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.
[time=2659] When I'm trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." This man makes two critical errors.
[time=2668] Critical error number one is this.
[time=2670] He'd cast an excuse.
[time=2673] Our human nature is always to make excuses for ourselves.
[time=2677] I told you the story when our kids were about ages one, three, and four.
[time=2682] Handwriting mysteriously appeared on the wall.
[time=2685] The same day that we bought a goldfish which Adam named Wally.
[time=2689] It was pretty obvious that Adam was the culprit, but being a just father, I corralled all three of them and said, "Who wrote on the wall?" Three dumb looks.
[time=2701] It's not hereditary.
[time=2705] So I start from eldest to youngest, and I say, "Rachel, do you write on the wall?" No, Rebecca, did you write on the wall?
[time=2712] Didn't do it.
[time=2714] Adam, do you write on the wall?
[time=2716] I knew he did it.
[time=2717] I mean, it was the right height.
[time=2719] No, it's kind of indicting, so I didn't do it.
[time=2723] So Adam, Rachel says she didn't do it.
[time=2726] Rebecca said she didn't do it.
[time=2728] You didn't do it.
[time=2729] Who did it?
[time=2731] Wally.
[time=2734] A year and a half years old, and he's blaming the goldfish for writing on the wall.
[time=2739] That's human nature.
[time=2741] Here's a great one.
[time=2742] It comes to us from California, Oakland.
[time=2745] The executive of an company requires his employees when they are late to work.
[time=2750] They have to sign in late, put down the time, and the reason why they're late.
[time=2755] Typically, the problem is the weather, and a person will come in, write their name, jot down the time, and write fog.
[time=2762] And everybody else who comes in late writes down their name the time, and just puts some ditto marks, the fog.
[time=2768] One night came in one day.
[time=2771] It happened to be a foggy day, but that wasn't his excuse.
[time=2774] In truth, he wrote his name the time, and he explained he was late because his wife had had twins.
[time=2781] It was true.
[time=2783] The next 18 people walked in, signed their name the time, and put ditto marks.
[time=2791] Excuses.
[time=2793] That's human nature.
[time=2795] And when God looks down at us with his all-knowing eye in his ever-penetrating mind,
[time=2801] he says, "Do you want to get well?" and we say, "You wouldn't believe what happened today."
[time=2808] That's human nature.
[time=2809] They give excuses.
[time=2810] This one comes from just north of the border.
[time=2813] It was recorded in the newspaper in Woodstock, Ontario, called the Sentinel Review.
[time=2818] "Our American visitors are normally welcome here, but occasionally they reveal some odd notions about our country."
[time=2828] One man charged with driving 74 miles an hour gave a captivating explanation.
[time=2835] He thought that since the Canadian gallon is larger than the US gallon,
[time=2841] the miles up north might be longer than they are in the States.
[time=2844] And so he explained that he thought he had to drive 74 miles an hour to get 60 miles an hour in Canada.
[time=2852] He was given a ticket and the magistrate clarified his heir and fined him in Canadian dollars, which are smaller than US dollars.
[time=2862] Excuses.
[time=2864] It's our normal human nature.
[time=2868] When we have a problem and we have failed the corrected or to control it,
[time=2874] to take three fingers and pull them back and extend one and say,
[time=2880] "The problem was that guy, if he wouldn't, if she hadn't, if that kid's, you know what they're like?"
[time=2886] And the excuses flow instinctively.
[time=2890] Jesus says, "Do you want to get well?" And the man didn't say, "Lord, I want to get well." The man just started off with an excuse.
[time=2898] The second thing that the man did is that he clung to a bad plan.
[time=2906] His plan was this.
[time=2911] He was waiting for an angel to come by and to disturb the water.
[time=2917] And in disturbing the water, he wanted to be the first guy in to be healed.
[time=2922] This gives rise to a number of problems.
[time=2926] So take a deep breath and we're going to tackle some aside issues which we cannot avoid and still be honest with the text.
[time=2933] If you're using a King James Bible today, you have verse four.
[time=2937] If you have a new international version which I happen to have here today, you have no verse four.
[time=2943] It goes one, two, three, five.
[time=2946] What's the explanation?
[time=2948] Well, I wish I could tell you that the editors couldn't count.
[time=2952] But the truth of the matter is, in verse four, there is a statement.
[time=2958] The statement says this, "From time to time, an angel of the Lord would come and stir up the waters.
[time=2965] The first one into the pool after each disturbance would be cured of whatever disease healed him."
[time=2971] Why is that in the King James Bible and why is it not in the new international version?
[time=2978] Well, that leads us into a systematic study of papriology.
[time=2983] Fascinating, isn't it?
[time=2985] Papriology is simply the study of examining documents that were made out of papayri.
[time=2993] The explanation is this, as we open up our Bibles, you can trust it and it's accurate.
[time=3001] But we need to confess to you, there is not a library in the world where you can go to the card catalog.
[time=3007] Let's say in Jerusalem and go, "Hey, John, J-O-J-O-H-N, here it is." Gospel according to John, the original penned by John.
[time=3015] B-S-137.J-3.
[time=3018] Go over to the stacks and pull off this scroll.
[time=3022] There it is, sign John at the bottom.
[time=3024] It's gone.
[time=3025] We don't know where it is.
[time=3027] Not only for the Gospel of John, but for every book of the Bible, we do not have the original document.
[time=3034] What we do have are hundreds, thousands of handwritten documents that date back to within a shadow of John's day.
[time=3045] And how our Bible is determined is scholarly people examine these documents and reconstruct the original from the documents.
[time=3055] Now, let me tell you how marvelously God has preserved these documents so we would have His word.
[time=3061] Have you ever heard of Plato's Republic?
[time=3064] Or if you've been educated in political theory, your head will nod, yes.
[time=3068] Greek handwritten copies of Plato's Republic you could count without taking off your shoes.
[time=3074] They're just a handful.
[time=3076] The most documents available for any writing other than the Bible would be Homer's Iliad in the Odyssey.
[time=3086] The story of Ulysses.
[time=3088] We have sparse 100 partial documents.
[time=3092] For the Greek New Testament, we have 5,300 documents.
[time=3096] And scholars have pieced these together.
[time=3099] The problem is this.
[time=3102] In the earliest documents that were found when the King James Bible was written in 1600,
[time=3108] this mysterious verse 4 was in many of the documents.
[time=3112] So even though they rated it very poorly, they put it in because it helped to explain why the man was at the pool.
[time=3120] Since the year 1600s, more documents have been discovered than were existing in 1600s.
[time=3126] For example, the greatest archaeological find of documents you've heard of.
[time=3130] It's called the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[time=3132] They were found within many of the lifetime of the people here.
[time=3138] And now as we study the text, we see that it probably was just added as an explanation.
[time=3145] Can I trust my Bible?
[time=3147] Oh, you can trust it.
[time=3149] Of all these scholars, the leading one is a man by the name of FF Bruce.
[time=3153] Here's what he has penned.
[time=3155] There is no body of ancient literature in the world which enjoys such a wealth of good textual
[time=3161] exploitation as does the New Testament.
[time=3170] The Bible that you hold in your hands is 99% accurate to the originals.
[time=3176] And the 1% that we have to scratch our head and say, "We ain't sure." Does not affect the teaching of the overall Bible truth.
[time=3186] You can trust your Bible today.
[time=3189] Now, we need to make some conclusions that help us sort through this man's situation.
[time=3194] Let me make three of them.
[time=3196] One is this.
[time=3197] The Bible does not say that an angel came by, stirred the water.
[time=3202] People crawled in and the first guy in was the first guy out because he was healed.
[time=3206] The Bible doesn't say that.
[time=3207] The Bible simply says that this man believed that.
[time=3212] Secondly, there is no record in the Bible or any history of such a healing occurring.
[time=3218] I mean, if you went through Josephus and Septonius and Herodotus, you'd never find a reference to miraculous healings at the pools.
[time=3226] What happened was this.
[time=3227] These two pools that were earthen pools were fed by an underground spring, which in turn was
[time=3233] fed by an underground stream.
[time=3235] And as the water level and pressure in the spring would change, the water would occasionally gurgle and bubble.
[time=3242] They attributed it to an angel.
[time=3244] The only people who were healed there were those who had psychosomatic conditions, which brings
[time=3250] us back to this point.
[time=3252] The man not only cast excuses, but he clung to a bad idea.
[time=3259] How long we don't know, but it could possibly be that the 38 years that he was infirmed
[time=3265] were the 38 years he sat by the side of the pool.
[time=3270] I believe in getting a plan and sticking your plan and making the best of it, but I want to make this suggestion.
[time=3276] If you are trying a plan for 38 years and it hasn't worked yet, it may be time for a
[time=3283] new plan.
[time=3286] I believe in giving it the good old college try.
[time=3289] I threw up some desperation tests onto the lap of the professor.
[time=3295] But after 38 years, it's time to find a new plan.
[time=3300] And this guy said, "I got my plan.
[time=3303] It's their fault.
[time=3304] It's not mine." He was clinging to a bad plan.
[time=3310] He reminds me of so many of us, who instead of following God, follow our own plan.
[time=3318] This individual.
[time=3325] We've come into your home today to share music, music from the Living Christmas Tree Choir,
[time=3332] and our special guest, Lana Young.
[time=3335] The message today was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3338] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3348] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful for your sending your son Jesus Christ to die on
[time=3354] the cross for my sins.
[time=3356] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3360] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3365] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3369] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3374] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance, to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3383] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance, or the devotional guide Closer Walk, please write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3398] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and ask for tape number 1428, or use the sermon title if the shoe fits.
[time=3406] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3417] Each week is my privilege to share God's Word with you because of the people behind the scenes who make the Bible Hour possible.
[time=3426] Today, on the last day of the year, we want to express our thanks to them for their hard work as volunteers, coming in early in the morning, staying late into the afternoon to bring to you the Bible Hour.
[time=3438] Here are some of the people who have made it possible.
[time=3451] [MUSIC - 84 seconds]
[time=3550] As we say goodbye to 1989 and the decade of the 80s, we want to wish each of you a very happy new year.
[time=3558] And express to you our deep gratitude for joining us Sunday by Sunday for the Bible Hour.
[time=3564] We greatly appreciate your final answer to support and your prayers and behalf of this ministry.
[time=3570] May God give you a great new year.
