[time=754] thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour Today. We're taping this just a couple days before Christmas and if you're like me, I have a little bit more shopping to do and I hope that tomorrow I have that opportunity and while we're thinking about Christmas, we do want to wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Christ-filled New Year. Many of the Founders Club members have received a letter in the last couple weeks telling you about our financial situation here at the Bible Hour. We are in the red and we are just considering the fact that we want to be in the black at the end of the year and I hope that you will take time to give us a year-end gift. I hope that's in your plans and that God will enable you to do that. We do appreciate the fact that you support us very faithfully throughout the year. Also, you should have received our new devotional booklet entitled Fresh Moments.
[time=801] This takes a place of the booklet Closer Walk and will be delivered to your home every two months. It's a daily devotional and you could read portions of scripture with explanations and there are other articles contained in the book. I hope that you'll enjoy Fresh Moments.

[time=841] Wayne, Indiana, 46815. Right now, at the beginning of the new year, there's no better time to
[time=848] start reading the scripture than at the beginning of the year. I hope you'll write for Fresh Moments today. Well, I'd like to welcome on the insert Jim Pearson. Jim, you're no stranger
[time=859] to the Bible Hour. You've preached many times and been on the insert. I'm glad to have you here this morning. Good morning. Pete, good morning. It's always a pleasure to be here with you. We've added a little highlight and a little color to our set today as we welcome your wife Linda. Linda, it's good to have you on the Bible Hour today. This is a special time with Christmas coming up. What are some of your favorite things that you do at the Christmas season, Linda? Well, Pete, I kind of enjoy doing it all with my family. I enjoy the shopping and the cooking and the baking and the entertaining, but as I look back, just share the Christmas story and the true meaning of Christmas with my own children and watching them wander in the excitement of it all through their eyes is probably my favorite thing this season. Well, I bet Drew and Kyle are always excited when you, they have a lot
[time=902] of energy. I understand they're already with grandma, but this is a great time to be together with family and we do appreciate your family and the faithfulness of you working with our children Sunday after Sunday. That's very important to our ministry and we're grateful for that. Thanks, Pete. Jim, you're preaching this morning. Some words of wisdom concerning the message you're going to preach in a few minutes. Pete, my message is titled Behold the Man Christ Jesus. So many times we look at the Christmas scene and we see a baby in a manger, but let us never forget that we are to behold the God man. Behold the man Christ
[time=934] Jesus. That's what the message is about today. Well, it must have been an exciting night, Jim, when the angels announced to the lowly shepherds the Christ had been born and then the shepherds came and just automatically fell down and worshiped them and then they shared the story immediately. It was a great step of faith. They just believed right away and shared that message and we've been able to hear it and now it's our solemn and responsibility and privilege really to share the message that the Savior has born and I look forward to your message today. Just before we go back to our live portion of the service, I wanted
[time=969] to tell you about another date that I want you to set aside. That's January 31 on a Thursday evening. Just last week I talked with Dr. John MacArthur and he'll be in our area and we're going to have a great media rally that night right here at Blackhawk Baptist Church. Once again, the date for that is January 31 at 7 p.m. here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=991] Dr. MacArthur is a famed radio speaker and has written a number of books and is the pastor
[time=997] of the Grace Community Church in Panorama City, California. I hope that you'll set that data side and meet Dr. MacArthur and hear him. He's a marvelous speaker, you'll enjoy it. We're going back to the music and the message from Jim Pearson. God bless you as you worship with
[time=1013] us today.
[time=1027] [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=1172] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1178] As I was watching Pete Coby bustle back and forth from the front to the front to the front to the platform, it dawned on me that I'd never seen Pete get so much exercise in a morning worship service. Then it dawned on me that I'd never seen him get that much exercise. If you're visiting with us here at Blackhawk this morning, we're just thankful
[time=1199] that you've taken this Christmas Sunday to join with us. To come and share half a day of
[time=1205] your busy time on a Sunday morning with us here, I'm just tickled to death that you're here today that you could join with us as we celebrate once again the birth of our Lord.
[time=1214] I'd like you to turn with me to the first chapter of the Gospel of John and that after you
[time=1221] have found the first chapter of the Gospel of John, I'd like you to put your finger in and just close your Bible back up for a few moments. Find the first chapter of the Gospel of John and then close your Bible. I want to pray for some of the needs of the church, and then I want to share with you the Christmas story, and then we will turn to the Gospel of John as we consider the theme this morning. Behold the man, Christ Jesus. Let's pray.
[time=1247] Father, thank you this morning that we can indeed fall on our knees before you, that
[time=1253] we can indeed come to you knowing that you are God the Father, the one who sent the son,
[time=1260] that he might be born, take on the form of a man, and then one day go to the cross of
[time=1266] Calvary, shed his innocent blood that we might have everlasting life. Father, thank you so much for that truth. Thank you so much for the fact that you sent him, that we can celebrate
[time=1277] that time again this morning. And Father, thank you for the privilege of coming to you in this morning. Oh, I would pray again for John Firstput, who is back in the hospital this morning here in Fort Wayne. Father, I just pray that you would be with John and Naomi as they go through the second time in the hospital within just a couple of weeks. Father, I thank you for successful surgery for Carol and Parliament. Thank you that she can be home. Be with her family enjoying that time at this Christmas season. And Father, I would just thank you
[time=1308] for the fact that Meg and Minut could be treated with traction, that a bone could be put back in place, that pain could be relieved. Father, I just pray that you will continue to heal her body. And then Father this morning, we come to you on behalf of the woman family. We'll
[time=1324] come to you on behalf of Lloyd and Gary and Becky. As Gary's mother, Lloyd's wife lies
[time=1330] an intensive caret part for you this morning. Father, I just ask that you would undertake in this situation. Father, I just put Betty in your hands. Father, more than anything else, we want your will, but we would ask that you would heal her body, that you would raise her up from this bed of affliction. Father, we just bring all of the needs of our church to you for all of those that are suffering today and ask your blessing upon our service now in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1358] In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire
[time=1365] Roman world. Now this was the first census that was taken while Quiranius was governor
[time=1371] of Syria, and everyone went to his own town to register. So Joseph also went up from Nazareth
[time=1379] in Galilee to Judea to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house
[time=1385] and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and who was expecting a child. And while they were there, the time came for the
[time=1396] baby to be born, and Mary gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in strips
[time=1403] of cloth and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them at the end. And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at the night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you
[time=1425] good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today, in the town of David, a
[time=1431] Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord." Now this will be assigned to you.
[time=1438] You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger. Suddenly, a great
[time=1444] company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace to men on whom his favor rests." When the angels
[time=1455] had left them and gone back into heaven, the shepherd said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about." So they
[time=1466] hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in a manger. When the
[time=1473] shepherds had seen him, they spread the word concerning. All that had been told them about this child and all who heard were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary
[time=1486] treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all of the things that they had heard and seen, which
[time=1497] were just as they had been told. An ordinary story? Oh no. An extraordinary story. The extraordinary
[time=1507] story of an extraordinary birth, of an extraordinary Savior. On that first Christmas night, it
[time=1517] was as if God was saying through all of creation, "Behold the child, Christ Jesus. Behold my
[time=1526] son, the Savior has been born." He is Christ Jesus. The shepherds went into Bethlehem as
[time=1535] the story was told. And they bowed down and worshiped the young child. And then it says
[time=1541] that they went about testifying to the greatness of his glory. They told everyone that they
[time=1547] saw, "Behold the child, Christ Jesus." Oh, the son would be taken to the temple on the
[time=1556] eighth day of his life. And one of the rabbis, a man named Simeon, would hold him up and he would say, "Behold the man, Christ Jesus. Behold in the form of a child, the Savior of Jew and
[time=1568] Gentile alike has been born. Behold the child, Christ Jesus. Jesus would grow in one day when
[time=1578] he was 12 years old. He would be in the temple. And his parents would find him discussing and arguing with the rabbis. And all were confounded by his wisdom. The rabbis stepped back, looked
[time=1590] at this young boy of 12 years old and told the world, "Behold the young man, Christ Jesus. Behold
[time=1598] this young man with this wisdom." And then there would come a time when Jesus would grow
[time=1604] to his adulthood. He would begin his ministry. And one day he would be walking by. And John
[time=1610] the Baptist would say, "Behold the Lamb of God who takeeth away the sin of the world. Behold
[time=1616] the man, Christ Jesus." Jesus would come and meet with a lady at the well. And he would
[time=1624] change her life. And she would go back into the village from where she came. And she would tell them, "I've met a man unlike no other man I've ever seen. You must see him for yourself. Go and
[time=1635] see him. Behold the man, Christ Jesus." They went and beheld him. Oh yes, on that first Christmas
[time=1645] day, and throughout his life, many said, "Behold the man, Christ Jesus." At the age of 33, as Jesus
[time=1655] Christ would hang on the cross of Calvary, he would look down lovingly at his mother and he would say, "Woman, behold thy son." He was saying, "Behold the man, Christ Jesus." You know many in
[time=1673] Christ's day embraced him. They trusted in him as their Savior and as their Lord. And after they
[time=1679] had trusted in him, they went about and told others, "Behold the man, Christ Jesus." But many in
[time=1686] Christ's day rejected him. They insulted him. They spit on his face. They refused to accept the
[time=1695] forgiveness that he offered. They refused to behold the man, Christ Jesus. Through history many have
[time=1705] embraced him, but many too have rejected him. Who was this man? Who was this man that we are to
[time=1713] behold this morning? Oh, some would say that Jesus Christ was just a myth, but the historical
[time=1720] evidence outside of the Bible itself paints an irrefutable picture of the life of a man named
[time=1728] Jesus Christ. Still others would say that he was just a prophet, a holy man, but the miracles that
[time=1734] he worked show that he was no ordinary man, no ordinary prophet. Still others would say that
[time=1742] Jesus Christ was a liar, but would a liar go to a cross and die for a lie? Still others would say
[time=1752] he was a lunatic, but lunatics don't speak with the wisdom and the clarity that Jesus Christ taught.
[time=1761] This morning I want us to again behold the man, Christ Jesus, behold the man in all of his
[time=1771] splendor and awe this morning. As we turn back to the gospel of John and look at these first five
[time=1779] verses, I want to challenge us this morning to behold the man Christ Jesus. And as we do and go
[time=1785] through these verses, this morning I want us to behold the man from four important perspectives.
[time=1792] From four important perspectives this morning, let's behold the man Christ Jesus.
[time=1798] Verses one through five from the gospel according to John chapter one. In the beginning was the word
[time=1806] and the word was with God and the word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all
[time=1814] things were made without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life and that life was
[time=1820] the light of man. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.
[time=1828] This morning in verses one and two, first of all I want us to behold the man Christ Jesus,
[time=1835] I want us to behold his deity. Jesus Christ was God manifested in the flesh and in these first two
[time=1844] verses of chapter one. John paints an irrefutable picture of Jesus Christ the divine son of God.
[time=1852] Let's look and see what he says. First of all he says that in the beginning was the word.
[time=1859] The word of God. What a marvelous stroke from the pen of John inspired by God as he wrote this gospel.
[time=1868] What a better way to describe the manifestation of God the son as he took upon the form of a man
[time=1875] yet remaining 100% God. He took on the form of a man. He became the living word. What does that mean?
[time=1883] Well if I was to try to describe to you what was going on in my heart or in my mind I would want
[time=1891] to use words. If I was trying to convey to you the thoughts that are going on inside of me I would
[time=1897] speak to you with words and explain what I wanted you to know. When John says that Jesus was the
[time=1903] living word what he is saying is he was the word the very words of God who came in the flesh and
[time=1911] as the word of God he came to reveal God himself to mankind. He came to reveal God in his love.
[time=1921] He came to reveal God in his truth. He came to reveal God for what he was the supreme God
[time=1928] of the universe. When John says that he was the word of God what a wonderful way of showing the
[time=1936] heart and the mind of God Almighty as he reached out to mankind through the living word. You know
[time=1944] only deity could be the word of God. No mortal man in any way could ever become the word of God.
[time=1952] It was only by being God himself manifested in the flesh that Jesus Christ could become
[time=1958] the living word. No one else could reveal the person of God to mankind but let's move on he's
[time=1966] called the word it shows his deity then it says he is eternal. Notice that it says in the beginning
[time=1973] was the word. Does that sound familiar to you this morning? Think of Genesis chapter one when the
[time=1979] Bible begins in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Here John says in the beginning
[time=1987] was the word. I think there's no mistake there I think that John meant to do exactly what he did
[time=1994] there and in there it shows us another aspect of the deity of Christ and that is his eternal
[time=2000] pre-existence. Jesus Christ was eternal he had no beginning he will have no end. In Genesis it says
[time=2009] in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. In other words he was saying that there was
[time=2015] a time of creation back in the beginning of time God created the heavens and the earth but note what
[time=2022] it says about Jesus Christ it says in the beginning in other words in the time when creation took place
[time=2028] the word already was. Jesus Christ was then already in existence oh Jesus was not a created being Jesus
[time=2039] was not the first of all creation Jesus Christ is eternal he has existed with God the Father
[time=2046] since the very beginning of time they have no beginning they have no end only deity could be
[time=2053] eternal but then notice as we go on and discussing these various aspects of Christ deity notice
[time=2061] in the following clause that he had divine fellowship divine fellowship it says
[time=2067] in the beginning was the word and the word was with God a literal rendering of the Greek there would
[time=2076] say that God the word and God the Father were face to face it speaks of an equal coexistence it speaks
[time=2086] of a close communion a close knit communion and fellowship of divine son divine father together
[time=2094] throughout eternity together enjoying the communion that only God could enjoy oh no mortal man could
[time=2105] enjoy that communion of divine fellowship with the Father of being with the Father in that way only Jesus could do that it says that he was with the Father Jesus alluded to that in John chapter 17
[time=2119] when nearing the time of his death he spoke of how he yearned for the time when he enjoyed that
[time=2125] fellowship with the Father and he was saying I know that it's soon coming coming again I miss it now but I'll soon have it again oh Jesus had divine fellowship no human could ever have divine fellowship
[time=2139] with God the Father and then lastly and perhaps most clearly it says that he was God himself proof
[time=2147] again of his deity it says that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word
[time=2153] was God oh John couldn't have made it any planer he was saying that that little baby born in a manger
[time=2161] born in Bethlehem that baby was God himself manifested in the flesh that he was Jesus Christ
[time=2170] he was God not a God but God himself you know one of the things that is difficult for us to understand
[time=2179] in Christian theology is the whole doctrine of the Trinity and I have to admit that it's
[time=2185] challenging and confusing but the Bible teaches plainly I believe that the triune God had exists
[time=2192] in God the Father God the Son and God the Holy Spirit three and one one and three the same in
[time=2200] essence but different in function oh we can't explain it all but it teaches that the Father the
[time=2207] Son and the Holy Spirit are all co-equal they are all a part of the divine Trinity the triune
[time=2213] Godhead oh we can never understand it I remember a story that was told to me when I was a seminary
[time=2220] student and it explains the trouble of trying to understand this great Christian doctrine seems that a young seminary student in his second year raised his hand on the first day of class
[time=2232] he raised his hand to the professor and he said doctor last spring when I left for the summer I understood the doctrine of the Trinity completely but over the summer I've kind of forgotten some of it and gotten a little confused would you repeat it so that once again I could understand it the professor looked at him with a ry smile on his face and he said son you know that's really
[time=2253] too bad you see you were the first person in the history of the world that understood it and now you forgotten it a very intelligent writer has written the statement he who describes the Trinity
[time=2267] loses his mind he who denies the Trinity loses his soul Jesus Christ was God he was deity in the highest sense deity in the highest form
[time=2280] now what does that mean for us this morning here on this Christmas Sunday what does that mean for us
[time=2286] as we study about Jesus Christ well if Jesus Christ was God and he is then it means that
[time=2294] everything that he said is true and Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man comes
[time=2304] to the Father but by me today if you're here this morning visiting with us or perhaps you've
[time=2313] sat through many many messages here at Blackhawk Jesus was God and he said he's the only way of
[time=2319] salvation and if you're trusting in any other way of coming to the Father if you have hope of
[time=2326] everlasting life in any other way the Bible teaches you're on sinking sand because only the
[time=2332] Son of God only Jesus Christ God the Son is the way by which we can come to the Father won't you
[time=2340] trust in him this morning won't you trust in the salvation that he offers you this morning in Jesus Christ he was God and then as we go on secondly I want us to behold the man
[time=2352] his work in creation notice his work in creation in verse 3 it says through him all things were made
[time=2361] without him nothing was made that has been made oh that's very straightforward and simple isn't it
[time=2369] it says that Jesus Christ is the one who created and made all that has been made
[time=2375] Jesus Christ is the creator he is the one who both individually corporately separately he is the
[time=2383] one who has made everything right down to the most minute detail Jesus Christ is the creator
[time=2389] now scripture teaches that God the Father and God the Son really are partners in that creation
[time=2396] if you go through scripture you will see that it describes God as the author of creation
[time=2402] it teaches that the plan the architectural plan so to speak for creation came from the
[time=2408] divine mind of God oh it says that he was the author he is the one who created
[time=2415] I should say gave the plan by which creation came into being first Corinthians chapter 8 says
[time=2423] there is one God the Father from whom all things came God spoke and it happened God said in his
[time=2432] creative mind let there be light and there was light let there be dry land and there was dry land
[time=2441] let there be fish in the sea and there were fish in the sea oh the divine plan came from God the
[time=2449] Father but that same verse tells us that God the Son was the agent of creation the God the Son is the one who carried out the creative plan of God and created all that is you and I and all that we
[time=2462] see and all of the universe around us that same verse says there is one Lord Jesus Christ through
[time=2468] whom all things came the Bible's plain God the Father the author of creation but God the Son
[time=2478] the agent the one who carried out the creative work of God in the universe why is that important
[time=2485] today why is that important for us to cling to the truth that Jesus Christ is the creator I believe
[time=2492] that it's important today because we live in a time and in a society where the creation epic the
[time=2499] creation fact is not taught many times in institutions and is not believed by many within the scientific
[time=2507] community oh there are those within our society who would teach that man you and I came about
[time=2513] through evolution through time by chance that somehow we have evolved over millions of years
[time=2521] from a lower form and now today we exist in the form of man they deny the genesis account of
[time=2528] creation they deny that that man was created by God they say that he evolved from a lower form
[time=2536] why is it important that we not compromise on that issue why is it important that we cling to the genesis account it's important because if we accept any other creation story then we are
[time=2548] denying the inerrancy of scripture we are denying the fact that this is God's inerrant word and he
[time=2555] has told us that in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth another reason why it's
[time=2562] important that we take a strong stand this morning is that evolution cheats mankind out of his rightful
[time=2568] position the bible doesn't teach that we evolve from animals or some lower form it says that God
[time=2575] looked down upon us and in his divine plan he created man in his image we are man we exist in
[time=2583] the image of God he loved us he created us he gave us dominion over the earth and said you will rule
[time=2591] over the earth you are my special creation and it says that he breathed life into the nostrils
[time=2599] of man after he created man from the dust of the earth oh we lower the standing of man when we
[time=2606] deny the creation account Jesus Christ was the creator we must never forget it behold his creative
[time=2616] work the man Christ Jesus the creator thankfully a lot is being done to defend biblical creation
[time=2623] today one of those great creation scientists was here at blackhawk last summer some of you may
[time=2629] remember dr scott hues that was here i remember asking dr hues on the way home from the airport
[time=2635] as i picked him up can you tell me a little bit about your educational background uh before we get there so i can introduce you and he looked at me and he said well it might be better for you to read it from my resume when you get back and i didn't know what he meant till i found out that he had nine academic degrees i found out that he not only had one phd but he had a doctor doctor degree
[time=2657] in theology was working on a third doctorate degree in computer science at that time ready to complete his third one great credibility great credentials but a man of god a man who believes
[time=2669] strongly in the genesis account of creation he wrote a great book entitled the collapse of evolution if you have a chance it's a wonderful book that i highly recommend that talks about
[time=2680] the fallacies of the theory of evolution scott hues said many things but one of the things that
[time=2687] struck me the most in his book was that the theory of evolution falls flat on its face because
[time=2693] the transitional life form that form that in between intermediate form between animal and man
[time=2700] the one that has to be found in order to see evolution is more than a theory has never been found indeed it doesn't exist there is no half man there is no half god and dr q said that is the
[time=2713] broadside that berry's evolution because there is no transitional life form in his book he writes a
[time=2720] very interesting thing he writes that the human eye with its great ability to focus to send stereoscopic
[time=2727] color pictures up to the brain 100,000 images in a day with the ability to heal itself with the
[time=2733] ability to automatically focus and automatically refocus like a wonderful camera and lens that
[time=2740] there is no way that the human eye could have ever come about through evolution through time
[time=2746] by chance it could have only been through the work of a divine creator in fact one of the men that
[time=2754] dr hues quotes in his book said this that the chance of the human eye developing through evolution would be one in ten to the 266th power now i have no idea how big that number is
[time=2769] i remember taking algebra one and doing so well that my teacher invited me back to take it again
[time=2776] the following year i had no idea what one in ten to the 266th power meant so i went to one of our
[time=2782] science teachers here at the school and i asked him if he could come up with some type of a word picture that i could use to describe it he did he finally told me this he said that if you were to
[time=2794] take the sun the planets and all of the solar system and then give them room to orbit you could
[time=2801] place them in a room seven thousand million miles long seven thousand million miles high
[time=2810] seven thousand million miles wide if you were to take a room that size and pour blue half inch
[time=2821] marbles into that room and fill it up and then you were to take one red marble drop it into the
[time=2830] room and then mix it up like you would in a bingo game all of the balls that you draw out and you
[time=2837] were to mix it up he said your chance of drawing the red ball would be one in ten to the 45th power
[time=2846] said i can't think of anything it can describe it any more than that one to the 266th power
[time=2855] that the human eye could have come about through the theory of evolution one uh one interesting
[time=2861] creation scientist has quoted the bible and paraphrased it he says faith is the substance
[time=2867] of fossils hoped for the evidence of links unseen oh that's so true as evolution fails
[time=2877] well this morning i want us to behold the man if we can't fathom one in ten to the 266th power
[time=2885] and we never can then we will never fathom all of the wonderful and deep riches of god
[time=2891] but this morning from his word he says behold the man christ jesus behold the man the creator
[time=2897] the author the finisher of the universe in which we live now what are the ramifications for that
[time=2905] oh if god created you and created me and he did if jesus christ was the creator of all that is
[time=2912] then it stands to reason that he knows you and he knows me better than anyone else
[time=2919] could ever know us he knows our needs he knows our strengths he knows our weaknesses
[time=2925] and that child born in a manger and now sitting at the right hand of god the father in glory says
[time=2932] trust in me i know what you need you need my salvation that i offer to you
[time=2939] have you trusted in him today do you know him as your savior and as your lord if not i would ask
[time=2946] you again behold the man christ jesus this morning in a way that you never have before
[time=2952] and then thirdly as we move on i want us to behold his gift of life and light
[time=2960] behold his gift of life and light turn to verse four he says in him was life and that life was the
[time=2970] light of man in him was life and that life was the light of man now it's interesting i think john
[time=2979] is giving us a double meaning for the word life there is no doubt that jesus christ is the creator
[time=2985] of all life that's true he just told us that in the previous verse and there can also be no doubt that jesus christ is the one who gives us eternal life spiritual life john is one in his writing
[time=2998] to be given to using words with double meanings and i think here he clearly met that jesus christ
[time=3004] is the one who gives us both physical life and spiritual life he says he is the one who gives the
[time=3011] gift of life he gives the gift of physical life he is the creator he is the sustainer he is the one
[time=3019] that holds our life and our universe in the palm of his hand and at his whim but then he's the one who
[time=3027] gave us spiritual life the life that john often uses he will mention it 56 times in his gospel
[time=3035] and in his first epistle 56 times and he will use it in reference to spiritual life to life eternal
[time=3043] spiritual life means everlasting life it means the eternal life that we get when we are born again
[time=3049] when we trust in jesus christ and john is saying that he offers you the gift of physical life but
[time=3055] more than that he offers you the gift of spiritual life regeneration being born again think of some
[time=3063] of the things that john said about jesus he said he came that men might have what might have
[time=3069] life life eternal those who come to him have life and that great pearl from john chapter three
[time=3078] for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever might believe on him
[time=3084] would not perish but have everlasting life everlasting life jesus is the source he gives us the gift
[time=3094] of life in him was life but then notice he goes on to talk about this gift of life but he also speaks
[time=3101] about something else he says and that life that life that spiritual and physical life is the light
[time=3108] of men what do you suppose he meant by that well let's go back to the realm of the physical first
[time=3114] first of all all of us who have physical life have a certain amount of light that has been revealed
[time=3120] to us by the very fact that we are created beings we have a certain amount of intelligence we have a
[time=3127] certain amount of discernment we have a conscience we have a mind that we can use god has shed a
[time=3134] certain amount of light and has given us light in our physical life all men whether they be believers or not have a certain amount of light that has been revealed to them by the fact that
[time=3145] they have these powers of thought and reason and discernment and conscience but more than that
[time=3152] he speaks of spiritual light here and he says that jesus is the one who gives us the gift of
[time=3159] spiritual light what's spiritual light spiritual light is the truth of god the holiness of god the
[time=3168] love of god and all that he is it's something that we can't have it's light that we can't see
[time=3174] until we believe on him and when we've trusted in him then we see god in a new and different way than we ever have before we see him as the truth we see him as the ultimate love we see him as the
[time=3187] ultimate wisdom we see him as the ultimate creative force behind the universe he says i have given
[time=3195] you spiritual light oh as we study and as we pray and as we go through the christian life it's
[time=3202] wonderful to know that christ can give us more and more light and that we can reveal that light and
[time=3208] let that light shine and illuminate the darkness of the world with the light that he has given us
[time=3214] jesus was the light of the world but now we can be the light of the world i remember very well
[time=3221] coming to blackhawk baptist church for the first time it was on the last sunday that the living christmas tree was up in 1983 it might have been the first day of january of 84 but i remember
[time=3233] coming we had moved here in september of 83 and i remember i was a believer but i wasn't walking
[time=3239] close with god i wasn't seeking after the light i wasn't seeking to shed his light to others
[time=3246] but i remember coming here in the old convocation center and listening to the word preached and it
[time=3253] was if if you'll pardon the pun a light went on inside my head i can honestly say that my spiritual
[time=3260] life has never been the same since since that time i have had a hunger for his word a hunger for his
[time=3266] light for his truth for his wisdom and i want that light to shine anywhere that i can let it shine
[time=3273] oh he gives us light the light of the world behold the man christ jesus this morning behold the man
[time=3283] the giver of life the giver of light that you might shine and know the things of god and then
[time=3293] fourthly and lastly this morning i'd like us to behold his rejection by the world behold his rejection
[time=3302] it's found in verse five he continues the thought of light and he says the light shines in the darkness
[time=3309] but the darkness has not understood it what did he mean by that well in scripture we often have
[time=3317] two contrasting worlds the world of light that's the world of spiritual life the world of jesus
[time=3324] christ the spiritual world the world of good it is the world of god and his goodness and then we
[time=3331] often have that contrasted to the world of darkness that is the world that is currently under the
[time=3337] control of satan and he energizes that world it is the world that does not possess jesus christ
[time=3344] and scripture often talks about a world of light in a world of darkness and he is saying here that
[time=3351] jesus christ was the light he was the light he shined in the darkness but the darkness
[time=3359] has not understood it that word understood can can be translated also comprehend or apprehend
[time=3367] it even has the connotation of embracing the world has not the darkness has not embraced him
[time=3374] jesus christ the darkness has not understood it the light shined in the day of jesus it shined
[time=3382] before him through john the baptist it's shined through jesus christ himself and then through the disciples and apostles and then all through church history it is shined by those who were believers filled with the power of the holy spirit who let their light shine but this verse says that
[time=3399] many will reject it indeed the world has rejected the light the world has rejected
[time=3407] the light this means that today most people when faced with the gospel will not embrace jesus christ
[time=3417] you might ask why is that well it's because we have a sinful nature that we were born with
[time=3424] and the bible teaches that because of that nature we naturally want to go our own way we want to do the things that we want to do and it causes us to reject spiritual things if we go through life without overcoming that and without reaching out and embracing jesus christ
[time=3441] the scripture also teaches that we can have a hardened heart and that the spirit of god cannot
[time=3449] penetrate that hardened heart that's an awful thought but it's taught that if we reject christ
[time=3455] that someday the spirit may not be able to pierce a hardened heart we've been sharing with you this morning the ministry of music from the living christmas tree
