[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Many of us who walk into the office of our pastor, our counselor, carry in all of our burdens and problems.
[time=85] And many of us carry those same burdens and problems out with us.
[time=90] It's because we only want to get rid of our problems.
[time=93] We don't want to pay the high price of changing our lives.
[time=98] (upbeat music)
[time=108] - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=112] Thank you for joining us.
[time=114] Rick's message today is entitled The Other Shoe.
[time=117] If you were with us last week, you'll recall, Rick's message was entitled If the Shoe Fits.
[time=122] It was a point of challenge to determine to get well.
[time=125] Many of us need to ask ourselves what Jesus asked the layman.
[time=129] Do you want to get well?
[time=130] Some of us want to escape the pain and problems of not being well, but are not willing to pay the price of a changed life in order to get well.
[time=138] Today's message is a continuation of last week's study and is entitled The Other Shoe.
[time=144] In this lesson, we will review last week's thoughts and the most important life-changing principle of all.
[time=150] Remember, if the shoe fits, wear it.
[time=153] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the book of John.
[time=157] Rick's text is taken from chapter five verses one through 15.
[time=161] Our special music today will be provided by Keith Brodigam and Susan Toyrack.
[time=169] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a number entitled, "Sing and Not Be Silent." (gentle music)
[time=182] [MUSIC - 41 seconds]
[time=232] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 75 seconds]
[time=318] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=379] - A great privilege we do have to sing to the Lord, almost high.
[time=384] I'll hail the power of Jesus' name.
[time=386] Let us lift up the name of Jesus as we sing numbers 97.
[time=390] You'll sing the first, third, and fourth stanzas together of number 97.
[time=395] (gentle music)
[time=408] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=460] (singing in foreign language)
[time=490] [MUSIC - 22 seconds]
[time=519] (choir singing in foreign language)
[time=547] - Let us continue in music now as we quiet our hearts and in preparation for the ministry that Keith Brottingham has in song, Speaking of the Love of God.
[time=556] (choir singing in foreign language) [MUSIC - 262 seconds]
[time=827] - If you are like us, it is hard to believe that we're well into a new year already.
[time=834] We hope yours is off to a great start.
[time=836] Is it for the Cobies?
[time=838] - Yes, Rick, we've put all the Christmas decorations away.
[time=841] The tree is up in its proper place and looks a little bit more like a normal auditorium today.
[time=846] - Well, we're glad to have the orchestra as a special edition on this Sunday.
[time=850] - It's always good to have the orchestra here.
[time=852] We have some people that play very well and we're glad when they can contribute their expertise and their abilities and the instrumental music to the congregational singing and the choir.
[time=862] - Well, our church is possible because so many volunteers give of themselves, choir or orchestra and all those people and because so many people give regularly, sacrificially and generously.
[time=873] And as we have just ended one year, I wanted to take just a moment to thank you friends who are either through your special gifts or through your regular support by way of the Founders Club have made the Bible hour possible.
[time=886] Every year on a regular basis, members of the Founders Club send in support that allows us to buy television equipment, purchase airtime and operate the Bible hour.
[time=897] Two or three times of year, we send out a mailing to all of our audience and we ask them to join in.
[time=903] And you've been generous and faithful and we want to thank you and we certainly do appreciate your partnership in this way.
[time=910] As we begin a new year, we're certainly going to need to have your help again.
[time=914] But we wanted to thank you at this time.
[time=917] Pete, I hate to say this, but we just had a conversation a moment ago.
[time=920] You're already thinking and planning for Easter, though that's three, four months away.
[time=925] - I was mentioning to you that I was studying Easter music and I was writing letters a little bit later and found myself talking about Easter and realized that might be a little premature for some people, but yesterday we did have a great clinic here in town that introduced all of the spring Easter type music that's available from the various publishers.
[time=945] And that's always a good time to see what's available.
[time=948] And I love the Easter music.
[time=950] There's so much pathos and passion in that music that it really is very stirring.
[time=956] - Well, we're looking forward to those new services that we'll have when that season comes with Good Friday and Easter and we'll share details with you.
[time=965] Right now we want to help you prepare to think about the Lord Jesus Christ and what the death and resurrection of Christ is all about with a book that we've put together here at Blackhawk titled Book on Salvation, What a Marvelous Salvation.
[time=980] This was put together by our associate pastor, Jim Pearson, who has spoken regularly on the Bible hour.
[time=987] It is a good, solid, biblical study on the meaning of salvation.
[time=993] Why Christ died?
[time=994] What sins penalty is?
[time=997] How do we know that his death covered our sins?
[time=1000] How do we know what words like redemption and forgiveness and salvation really mean?
[time=1006] Well, Jim's done an excellent way of putting the words and the theology into everyday understandable language and we'd like to send you a copy so that you can be better equipped as a student of God's word and nothing could be more important than understanding the doctrine of salvation.
[time=1024] If you'd like a copy, we'd be happy to send you one.
[time=1028] Right for your copy today to the Bible hour, 7,400 East state, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1036] That's the Bible hour, 7,400 East state,
[time=1042] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1046] As you study with us, you'll enjoy not only what is printed there by way of words, but there's some excellent graphics to help you understand the biblical truths.
[time=1057] This attractive book is over 30 pages long and it's free.
[time=1060] We want you to have a copy, even as we study today in the morning message, we're going to emphasize the importance of studying God's word.
[time=1070] That's why we make this literature available to you and we hope you'll take advantage of it.
[time=1074] Thank you again for joining us today here on the Bible hour.
[time=1077] We hope that you have an open Bible and an open heart as we sing and study today.
[time=1083] [MUSIC - 263 seconds]
[time=1351] - Thank you, Sue.
[time=1366] And Lord, we thank you today for the promise that we've heard again and again from your word in the melody of a song, "Fear Not My Child." Thank you for the power that comes to our life when we grab hold of Jesus' statement.
[time=1384] Let your heart be not troubled.
[time=1388] Neither let it be afraid.
[time=1390] You believe in God.
[time=1393] Believe also in me.
[time=1395] Lord Jesus, we meet here today on this Sunday morning because we believe that you are God.
[time=1403] We believe that you have power over life and death.
[time=1407] We believe you have a power and authority over our very beings.
[time=1411] We come today to submit ourselves to you, to your word, to your will.
[time=1417] We too often have come here, Lord, to tell you our will.
[time=1422] We want to ask forgiveness for that selfishness and that sin.
[time=1427] And we invite you today to take over the kingdom of our hearts and to rule with authority and our spirit and to control our lives.
[time=1437] Help us today to think right, to do right,
[time=1443] and then to enjoy the blessing of feeling what is right.
[time=1446] Help those of us who are battling with our feelings today to submit to your will because it is right.
[time=1454] And then please reward us with a sense of satisfaction and a new appetite so that we'll no longer want what is wrong, but we'll desire your will.
[time=1465] Like David, we cry out, creating me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[time=1472] We ask you to restore to us the joy of our salvation.
[time=1477] We ask you to accept the gifts that we've given today.
[time=1481] Our praise, as we sang, we just want to praise the Lord.
[time=1486] Our hearts adoration and agreement when Keith and Sue and the choir of sung for us and to you, we give you our praise today.
[time=1494] We ask you through your word to give power to our lives.
[time=1499] Give us power to obey.
[time=1501] Give us power to break the habits of canceled sin.
[time=1506] We ask you to set us free.
[time=1507] We ask you to make your word powerful that it would give strength to hearts to turn soft.
[time=1516] We ask to give your word power to comfort the soft hearts, particularly those who are feeling the pain of a loss of a loved one, particularly for Karun Sikafus, as she prays and concerns over her mother.
[time=1532] We thank you that her surgery was successful, pray that her recovery might be so.
[time=1538] Pray for Greg Hindle as he battles a fever and a low blood count that you'll raise him back to strength.
[time=1546] Pray for a little Amy Moore that you'll give her hope.
[time=1549] Pray for Jenny Lawson that you'll cause the laws of nature that you've created to work on her behalf that she'll recover from surgery.
[time=1558] And now give your word power in our lives.
[time=1562] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1565] Bill Gather penned a song that asked this question.
[time=1571] I hear you've been getting into the word, but is the word getting into you.
[time=1577] I've asked a young man in our church, Ted Geers, to take a moment to share a testimony of how God's word has been getting into his life and what a difference that is making in the hopes that Ted will be able to encourage you to get into God's word.
[time=1590] Thank you, Ted.
[time=1591] - Thanks, Rick.
[time=1592] - Hi, I'm Ted Geers and I just wanted to, as Rick said, share a few thoughts about my relationship with God.
[time=1600] I've found that the key to my successful Christian life is to keep a close, consistent walk with my God.
[time=1606] And I do this by spending time each morning alone with God reading his word and in prayer.
[time=1612] This not only prepares me for my day, but it also causes me to grow to maturity in Christ.
[time=1618] Something else I do is I don't wait for spare time.
[time=1621] I don't have any spare time.
[time=1622] I don't know if any of you have ever had spare time.
[time=1624] I have to make time for something like this.
[time=1627] And I also find when I spend time regularly with God, or when I fail to spend time regularly with God, I find myself sinning more often and I have a continued guilt due to that sin.
[time=1638] I also become unexplainably restless and I get short-tempered with my kids and also at work.
[time=1644] In general, I'm just much less tolerant with everyone around me.
[time=1648] But when I am close with God and obedient to him, I find that I'm much more stable and calm.
[time=1654] I'm more patient and also more forgiving of others.
[time=1657] And I have a peace that goes beyond human comprehension as the Bible says.
[time=1662] I also sin less then and I have no guilt because I confess this sin.
[time=1667] And I have an assurance that God is in control of everything that happens to me and around me.
[time=1672] One helpful tool that I've found is the Navigators 2-7 series as it's in the bulletin.
[time=1678] This series is for new Christians and believers that are just needing a fresh commitment to God and their lives.
[time=1684] It teaches daily devotional times with God and discipline, personal discipline and practical instruction from the Bible.
[time=1692] It also teaches how to have a deeper, more consistent walk with God and provides opportunity for fellowship with others.
[time=1699] I know I've grown immensely through the walk with God, this program fosters.
[time=1702] That's been very helpful to me.
[time=1704] I really have found a friend in Jesus and he has made all the difference in my life.
[time=1708] Thank you.
[time=1709] - Thank you, Ted.
[time=1713] I hope you know the power that God's word can have in your life as well.
[time=1718] If you have a Bible with you today, I want to invite you to open it to John chapter five.
[time=1724] We were studying there last week and we'll finish our study there this morning out of John chapter five verses one through 15.
[time=1732] Let me read those verses for you.
[time=1734] Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
[time=1741] Now, there is in Jerusalem near the sheet gate, a pool which in Aramaic is pronounced Beth Sudd, which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
[time=1752] Here, a great number of disabled people used to lie, the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.
[time=1761] One who was there had been an invalid for 38 years.
[time=1766] When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?" Sir, the invalid replied, "I have no one
[time=1784] to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.
[time=1788] While I'm trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." Then Jesus said to him, "Get up, pick up your mat
[time=1799] and walk." At once, the man was cured.
[time=1803] He picked up his mat and walked.
[time=1807] The day on which this took place was a Sabbath.
[time=1810] And so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is a Sabbath.
[time=1815] The law forbids you to carry your mat." But he replied, "The man who made me well said, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'" So they said to him, "Who is this fellow that told you to pick it up and walk?
[time=1832] The man who was healed had no idea who it was.
[time=1837] For Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
[time=1840] Later, Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again.
[time=1850] Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you." The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
[time=1860] Last week, we titled our message.
[time=1863] If the shoe fits, wear it.
[time=1866] Obviously, one shoe isn't gonna do any of us a lot of good.
[time=1871] So this morning, I'd like to give you the other shoe.
[time=1874] This passage of Scripture deals with an actual historical
[time=1880] event of a layman who Jesus miraculously healed.
[time=1885] Our studying it today is actually what we would call an allegorical message.
[time=1890] Now, what is an allegory?
[time=1892] An allegory is when you take one story about one circumstance and one set of events and draw applications from it to another circumstance.
[time=1902] Let me give you a famous allegory out of the Old Testament.
[time=1905] Nathan the prophet comes into David's court and says, "David, we've got a problem here.
[time=1914] Out in the country, there's this fat cat." And I mean, he's got cattle and sheep.
[time=1920] I mean, he's got it all, King David.
[time=1922] Thousands of sheep.
[time=1924] And then right next to him, King David, there's this one guy.
[time=1929] He doesn't have anything.
[time=1930] Oh, he's got one little lamb.
[time=1932] It was his pet.
[time=1935] He took it everywhere he went.
[time=1936] He loved that little animal, David.
[time=1939] It's precious to him.
[time=1940] King, you know what happened?
[time=1944] That big fat cat, snuck over one night, stole the only little sheep that man had and took it home.
[time=1952] What are we gonna do about it?
[time=1955] Oh, David said, "I'll tell you what we're gonna do." That man's gonna die for that.
[time=1960] Nathan looked at King David and said, "You're the man." For David had taken the wife of Uriah.
[time=1970] Her name was Bathsheba.
[time=1974] You are the man.
[time=1975] That's called an allegory.
[time=1976] When we take one story and apply it in a different way.
[time=1980] I wanna take this passage and use it to give us principles for life, even though there are very few of us here today who are lame.
[time=1988] There are very few of us here today who have a physical problem for 38 years.
[time=1993] Some do, but all of us have problems in our lives that the principles out of this word can change.
[time=2003] That's called an allegory.
[time=2005] Let me just review for you briefly for a moment.
[time=2008] Last week's single principle was this one.
[time=2011] Determine to get well.
[time=2016] Here's this man.
[time=2017] He's sitting on a mat next to a pool hoping someday he's gonna have a miracle take place in his life and it hasn't happened yet.
[time=2025] Jesus walks up to him and asks him a question.
[time=2030] Now this question is either the most insensitive question that anyone has ever stated or it is the most insightful question ever asked in history.
[time=2042] It's found in verse six where Jesus says, "Do you want to get well?" Hey, isn't that a obvious answer?
[time=2055] That's an old brainer.
[time=2057] Of course, anybody who can't walk wants to get well.
[time=2061] Anyone who can't talk wants to speak.
[time=2064] Anyone whose ears don't work wants to hear.
[time=2068] Anyone who's got financial problems wants help.
[time=2072] Isn't it obvious?
[time=2074] Not necessarily so.
[time=2078] Allow me to quote from one of my favorite authors and speakers probably yours too, Chuck Swindall.
[time=2084] On this passage, he makes this comment.
[time=2087] No matter how miserable your life has been, no matter how lame your spiritual life or how long you've been limping, Jesus can change it.
[time=2099] The real question is, do you want to get well?
[time=2104] It's easy to become accustomed to life around the pool of misery.
[time=2112] The peer group there certainly won't criticize you.
[time=2115] People will make space for your palate and then leave you to yourself or even commiserate with you.
[time=2122] But maybe after years of inner poverty, you're looking for a change, longing to be restored to everything God created you to be.
[time=2133] If so, Jesus is the ticket out of that slum.
[time=2137] If you really want to get well, he'll give you the grace and the strength to take up your palate and walk.
[time=2147] I believe Swindall has echoed the exact spirit of Jesus
[time=2154] do you really want to get well?
[time=2158] Because sometimes, if not often, we don't want to get well.
[time=2163] We don't want to change life.
[time=2166] We only want a temporary relief from the consequences, the pain of not being well.
[time=2174] In fact, many times,
[time=2180] we fail to cut ourselves off from our commissory circle.
[time=2185] What I mean by commissory circle is we often find those people who are always gonna be sympathetic, who are always gonna say, oh, that's too bad, that's not your fault.
[time=2196] There isn't anything you could have done about it anyway.
[time=2198] How can I help?
[time=2199] What do you need?
[time=2200] I'll give it to you.
[time=2201] We're learning in the people helping professions that too much help is not a good thing.
[time=2210] In fact, those who have worked with substance abuse have created a relatively new term called the enabler.
[time=2219] The enabler is that person who with the right motives and the right intentions come and rescues the victim.
[time=2227] And everybody believes they're doing exactly what they should.
[time=2230] They're rescuing this poor troubled soul.
[time=2233] And it may be absolutely the worst thing they can do.
[time=2238] Let me give you a quote from a source that I believe is the best friend any of you will ever have other than Jesus Christ.
[time=2244] If you're struggling with substance abuse, it's a book with a simple title, Alcoholics Anonymous.
[time=2251] It's called by its friends, The Big Book.
[time=2255] Here are two quotes out of it.
[time=2256] It's not a matter of giving that is in question, but when and how to give.
[time=2265] That often makes the difference between failure and success.
[time=2270] The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic commences to rely on our assistance rather than God.
[time=2280] He clammers for this or that, claiming he cannot master alcohol until his material needs are cared for.
[time=2288] Nonsense.
[time=2292] Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn this truth.
[time=2296] Job or no job, wife or no wife, we simply do not stop drinking so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence upon God.
[time=2311] A second quote, "Perhaps you will want to take the man "into your home for a few days.
[time=2317] "Be sure to use discretion.
[time=2319] "Be certain he will be welcomed by your entire family "and that he's not trying to impose upon your money, "connections or shelter.
[time=2328] "Permit him to do that and you only harm him.
[time=2334] "You will be making it possible for him to be insincere.
[time=2338] "You will be aiding in his destruction "rather than his recovery." The bottom line is this.
[time=2349] Do you want to get well?
[time=2353] Or do you want to find an enabler?
[time=2358] Do you want to change life?
[time=2359] Or do you just want somebody to rescue you from today's dilemma so you can return to yesterday's problems?
[time=2368] Many of us here have unwittingly played the role of the enabler, not just with the alcoholic but with perhaps our own children.
[time=2378] As a part of our school system, I'm amazed how different fathers and mothers are than my parents were.
[time=2386] When parents come in and the first words out of their mouth is, "My Johnny wouldn't have." I stand in this amay because my father read the United States Constitution this way.
[time=2403] My son is guilty until proven innocent.
[time=2406] He had the firm conviction that if there was a discrepancy between the teacher's account and my account, the teacher was to be believed.
[time=2417] Strange.
[time=2418] And we now have a whole generation of people who say, oh, the principal at Snyder High School certainly misunderstood.
[time=2428] It wasn't my little Herbie.
[time=2429] And what happens in our life is this.
[time=2434] We've got a cute little boy and it's hard for us to believe that he did a wretched rotten little deed.
[time=2439] And when our cute little boys accused of a wretched rotten little deed, we enable him to stay a bad little boy because we say,
[time=2450] oh, that's just his temperament.
[time=2454] Some of us are up, some of us are down, some of us are wild, some of us are passive.
[time=2459] That's just the way he is.
[time=2460] Or Johnny, he may have been there, but I'm sure it was the other guys that put him up to it.
[time=2466] And we apologize and excuse Johnny.
[time=2471] And what Johnny finds out is, somebody else will bear the consequences of my wrong behavior.
[time=2476] Somebody will rescue me.
[time=2478] Somebody will enable me.
[time=2479] I wish you had my position right now.
[time=2482] You wouldn't believe how many teachers are nodding like this at this very moment.
[time=2486] (audience laughing) And Johnny learns that there'll always be a rescuer.
[time=2493] There'll always be an enabler.
[time=2495] And Johnny doesn't want to change his life.
[time=2498] He just wants somebody to rescue him.
[time=2500] The person who likes shopping and spends
[time=2507] when they don't have the money doesn't want a budget.
[time=2511] They want somebody to tell him how to consolidate their loan, put it into payments they can afford and send them back to the mall.
[time=2520] We want a rescuer.
[time=2524] We don't want to get well.
[time=2529] Some of us have learned to control our family by losing our temper and flying off the handle.
[time=2536] And when our family is broken and fractured, we want somebody to come in and tell that family that they need to be more understanding with us.
[time=2544] We don't want to change.
[time=2548] We want a rescuer who's going to tell everybody else to adjust around our ill behavior.
[time=2553] And the shoe we put forth last week is this one.
[time=2557] Do you really want to get better?
[time=2560] Here's today's shoe.
[time=2562] To make it a matching pair.
[time=2564] Last week, determine to get better.
[time=2568] This week, determine to obey God's word.
[time=2573] Some of you are looking that past and you're saying how on earth did he get that out of these verses?
[time=2579] It's there in two places.
[time=2580] The first place it's found in verse eight.
[time=2583] After the man dishes out a bad excuse for his poor behavior, Jesus looks at him and he gives them three simple commands.
[time=2593] Get up, pick up, move out.
[time=2596] Get up, pick up your mat and walk.
[time=2602] Now, please don't read insensitivity into this.
[time=2608] Jesus didn't walk up to a guy who was physically incapable of walking.
[time=2613] Tell him to get up when it was still physically impossible for him to walk.
[time=2618] You need to remember who said, get up.
[time=2622] It was Jesus and his very words have power.
[time=2628] You see, there was a time in history past when there was nothing and Jesus said, let there be light and there was light.
[time=2641] There was a time when there was nothing and Jesus said, let there be land and there was land.
[time=2647] There was a time when there was nothing and Jesus said, let there be critters and there were critters everywhere.
[time=2653] And John and Colossians both tell us that he spoke the world into order.
[time=2660] Some of you guys like to fish and I've heard some of your fishing stories.
[time=2665] Haven't seen the pictures, the document them, but I've heard about some of your fishing stories.
[time=2670] I've got one you can't beat.
[time=2672] Jesus is approached by a tax collector and says, where's your taxes?
[time=2680] Jesus looks at one of his boys and says, throw a line into the water and a fish swims up and jumps on the hook.
[time=2688] Pretty good fishing.
[time=2691] But the story gets better.
[time=2692] Not only is this fish a trophy, but they open its mouth and he pulls out just the right amount of money to pay the taxes, flip it into the publicans box.
[time=2702] Notice I said public and not Republicans box and walks away having paid his taxes.
[time=2708] How did he do that?
[time=2709] Because he spoke and the fish obeyed him.
[time=2713] One of God's prophets was starving to death and God spoke and the ravens fed him.
[time=2720] He spoke and it happened.
[time=2724] The moment Jesus spoke, get up.
[time=2728] That man's body was physically restored.
[time=2732] If a central nervous system had been damaged, it was healed.
[time=2735] If muscles had given way to atrophy, they were restored.
[time=2740] If joints had been knit together by calcium, it was broke free.
[time=2744] If arthritis had immobilized them, he was rid of that dreaded disease because Jesus spoke.
[time=2751] And then the man's job was to get up and walk
[time=2757] and he obeyed God.
[time=2762] You know, sometimes Jesus tells us exactly what to do to fix our problem and we don't obey it because what Jesus tells us to do is hard, it's uncomfortable.
[time=2776] And we don't wanna follow it.
[time=2780] One of our pastors met with a man completely outside of this ministry.
[time=2786] The man was contemplating a financial situation.
[time=2789] He took him to 1 Corinthians chapter six where God told him exactly how to solve that problem and the man said, I see that, I understand that.
[time=2799] I'm not going to do that.
[time=2800] Because what Jesus told him to do was hard.
[time=2807] Didn't like it.
[time=2808] And every one of us are confronted with the hard sayings of Jesus that go against what we want emotionally or what we would choose financially.
[time=2819] And we must determine to obey it.
[time=2823] Now we live in a highly sophisticated age.
[time=2827] Very few of us would say, oh, I see what the Bible says.
[time=2832] Nah, I'm not gonna do that.
[time=2834] That's too overt.
[time=2837] We're too smart for that.
[time=2838] What we do is say, yeah, I saw that passage and I've been thinking about it.
[time=2842] You know, there's a lot of debate over what that verse means.
[time=2846] And just the other day I found a different pastor who had a different interpretation of that and I kind of liked his better than that.
[time=2855] Obey, Jesus.
[time=2863] If you want to get better then you have to determine to obey him.
[time=2869] If he says stay sexually pure, stay sexually pure.
[time=2873] If he says live within your means, live within your means.
[time=2877] If he says forgive that one and it's hurt you, he says forgive that one that has hurt you.
[time=2884] Obey his word.
[time=2887] Let me show you a second place where I get this.
[time=2890] It's in verse 14.
[time=2891] It's the day after.
[time=2893] Jesus meets the man again at the temple and he said to the man, see, you're well again.
[time=2902] And then he adds this line, stop sinning or something worse may happen.
[time=2909] Wow.
[time=2911] That is a pointed statement.
[time=2915] In this man's life, his infirmity was the consequence of his sin.
[time=2924] He was suffering physically for his failure spiritually.
[time=2932] That gives rise to this question.
[time=2934] When somebody is sick or somebody isn't an accident
[time=2940] or someone has a disease or someone has a problem, is that God punishing them?
[time=2946] I think we need to give two lines of answer.
[time=2951] Line number one is no, every time someone is sick or has a problem, it is not God punishing them.
[time=2962] For example, two weeks ago, our oldest daughter had a stomach ache, turned out to be the flu.
[time=2971] Three days later, our next daughter had a stomach ache, turned out to be the flu.
[time=2977] Our kids were at a cousin's house who two days before they got it, had the flu.
[time=2986] Wasn't a matter of sin, it was a matter of germs.
[time=2991] It wasn't a matter for the preacher, it was a matter for the pharmacist.
[time=2994] But sometimes, not all times, our sin
[time=3001] is the cause of our problems.
[time=3008] Let me give you two occasions.
[time=3010] The first occasion is this.
[time=3012] Sometimes our problems are the natural consequences of our sin.
[time=3019] Let me give you an illustration of what I mean.
[time=3021] A few nights ago, during the season to indulge and overeat, I made it a three day binge.
[time=3033] I went to bed completely exhausted from the workout that it took to shovel all that food into my mouth.
[time=3039] I collapsed on the bed into a sound sleep at 10.30.
[time=3044] I awoke at 1.30, very, very sick.
[time=3049] I went plop, plop, fizz, fizz, and it did nothing.
[time=3055] And I had this great guilt as I prayed, "Lord, please help me feel better." Because the only thing the Lord kept saying is, "He who indulges, bulges." (congregation laughing) That was the natural consequence of my sin.
[time=3076] If you choose to go out and get on a motorcycle, and I like to ride motorcycles, but you ride it irresponsibly and recklessly and wipe it out and you leave hide on the pavement, that's the natural consequence of your irresponsibility.
[time=3091] If you attacked the local shopping center,
[time=3097] armed with six credit cards in each hand, and you're now looking at the January bill and you're saying, "It hurts, it's painful." That's the natural consequence of your sin.
[time=3109] Sometimes our sickness, our problems
[time=3115] are the natural consequence of our sin.
[time=3117] But here's a second line of reasoning that you may not like, but it is true.
[time=3121] Sometimes God imposes natural consequences
[time=3130] in our life that are unrelated to our sin, but they're His form of punishment.
[time=3137] Let me give you an illustration, Ananias and Sephira, Acts chapter five.
[time=3141] Church had a capital funds drive.
[time=3144] People were bringing in money, selling jewelry, selling this, giving that.
[time=3148] One couple said, "Let's sell that extra piece of property." And they did.
[time=3152] They got a large sum of money and they decided, we didn't mean to give that much money, let's only give part of it.
[time=3158] That was fine.
[time=3159] They were under no obligation to sell the land.
[time=3165] But when they gave the part, they said it was all of the money.
[time=3170] Do you know what happened?
[time=3173] They dropped dead.
[time=3175] Now, the natural consequence of lying is neither,
[time=3183] your nose grows long like Pinocchio or you will drop dead.
[time=3188] If every time we lied, we'd drop dead.
[time=3191] Well, needless to say, none of us would be here today, including the one who is standing, not just you who are seated.
[time=3197] But God imposed that punishment on them.
[time=3202] In 1 Corinthians chapter 11, people took communion
[time=3208] and a church carrying dinner turned it into a drunken bash.
[time=3213] And the Bible said, "For that reason, "some of you are sick, some of you are weak, "and some of you sleep, they were dead." God punished them, unrelated.
[time=3225] The consequence of turning a church service into what it's not supposed to be doesn't always make you sick, but God imposed that on them.
[time=3234] It's the discipline of the Lord.
[time=3237] Now, let me make two quick applications.
[time=3239] Application number one is this.
[time=3240] Whenever something's going wrong in your life, it's worth asking the question, am I being disciplined by God for sin in my life?
[time=3249] Is this the natural consequence of what I did?
[time=3252] Or is there an obvious sin in my life and this is how God's getting my attention?
[time=3258] That's always worth asking yourself.
[time=3261] Second application is never ask the other person.
[time=3266] Notice you're not looking too good.
[time=3267] Any sin in your life you'd like to talk about?
[time=3272] Second Corinthians chapter 13 says, "Examine yourself." Doesn't say, "Examine the guy next to you." It says, "Examine yourself." Smartest thing you can do is always ask the question about you and never ask it about anybody else.
[time=3288] If the answer comes back negative, this isn't the natural consequence of my sin, nor do I know of anything for which God is having to go to this means to get my attention, then what you need to accept is, God may allow these hard times to happen so that like a diamond in the rough by his chiseling, he can refine you.
[time=3311] Now let me give you something to take hold.
[time=3316] This is good old standby advice.
[time=3319] I don't know who came up with it first.
[time=3322] It's called getting a grip on the Bible.
[time=3324] Five things you need to do if you wanna be serious about obeying God's word.
[time=3331] First thing we need to do with God's word is we need to hear it.
[time=3334] The scripture says of itself, "Faith comes by hearing and hearing by God's word." What a privilege you and I have.
[time=3341] This is not only the city of churches, it is the city of Christian radio stations.
[time=3345] There's W-L-A-B, W-F-C-V, and W-B-C-L, and you and I are never away from an opportunity of hearing God's word.
[time=3354] We not only have that, but there are tapes of some of the finest and some of the crumbiest preachers available in America for your listening.
[time=3362] There's no excuse for not hearing God's word.
[time=3367] Second thing we need to do is we need to read God's word.
[time=3372] Not just listen to somebody else, but open it up and read it ourselves.
[time=3376] Revelation 1-3, "Blessed is the one who reads this book." Third thing we need to do is study it.
[time=3383] Not just read it.
[time=3384] When I was in elementary school, I was such a lousy reader, I could read something, take the comprehension test and score zero.
[time=3392] My mind was somewhere else.
[time=3395] You've got to study it.
[time=3397] Let me give you some ways, right here at Blackhawk you can study.
[time=3399] If you're new to this church, are new to faith in Christ, two weeks from today, room 244, balcony, that way, Christianity 101, don't miss it.
[time=3410] If you're a little bit beyond that, Ted's going to be leading a program called 27.
[time=3415] That's a way to get rooted and grounded in God's word.
[time=3418] Details are in the bulletin.
[time=3420] Tonight we start Blackhawk Bible Institute, what a marvelous salvation.
[time=3424] Come and don't sit sour and soak, but come and sit and study.
[time=3428] Fourth thing you need to do with God's word is to meditate on it.
[time=3433] This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate therein day and night that you can observe to do according to all that's written therein.
[time=3441] Then you'll make your way successful.
[time=3444] Meditate means take what I heard, take what I know and think about how can I apply this to my life.
[time=3450] Okay, this passage says, do I want to get well?
[time=3453] Where is it in my life that I need to get well?
[time=3455] This passage says obey God's word, where do I need to obey?
[time=3459] Fifth thing to do is to memorize it.
[time=3461] If you want to win the game, then you got to know the plays.
[time=3465] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against you.
[time=3469] Five ways to get a grip on God's word.
[time=3474] (gentle music) - We've been sharing with you the ministry of music
[time=3488] from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and soloist Keith Brodigam and Susan Toyrat.
[time=3494] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3497] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior.
[time=3502] Just before we close, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3506] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to be born as a baby and then to die for my sins.
[time=3516] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3519] I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3526] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3529] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3534] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
