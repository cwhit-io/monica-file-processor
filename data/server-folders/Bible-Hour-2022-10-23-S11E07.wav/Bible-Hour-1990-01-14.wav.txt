[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] That Jesus was coming back at the end of the year 1990.
[time=65] What would you do this year?
[time=68] Would you repair a relationship?
[time=71] Would you tell a friend about the end of the world?
[time=73] Would you take that long, desired trip to Hawaii?
[time=77] If you knew Jesus was coming back in one month?
[time=81] How would you use that time?
[time=83] Would you begin to search the scriptures?
[time=86] Would you change your thoughts about heaven and hell?
[time=90] If you knew that Jesus was coming in one week?
[time=93] How would you use those seven days?
[time=96] Would you repent of your sins?
[time=98] Would you make promises to God?
[time=101] If you knew that Jesus was coming back in one day, how would you use today?
[time=108] (dramatic music)
[time=118] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=121] Thank you for joining us.
[time=123] Today's message is if Jesus were coming tomorrow, what should I do today?
[time=129] It is the first in a series of studies on the book of 2 Thessalonians.
[time=133] This letter of Paul was written to prepare us for the end of Earth's history and the return of Christ.
[time=140] How would you spend this year if you knew that it would be the last year of your life?
[time=144] The last month, the last week, the last day, or even the last hour.
[time=150] Special music today includes a selection from the Handbell Choir and a piano solo from Scott Schindler.
[time=159] We now join our service as the Sanctuary Choir brings us a song entitled, "Blessed Assurance." (gentle music)
[time=177] [MUSIC - 224 seconds]
[time=406] - To God be the glory for the wondrous salvation
[time=418] that He's given us, and we can say, I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep us to that day when He draws us to Him.
[time=427] Him number 409, please, we'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas.
[time=431] Let's sing it with great conviction, believing in thee that God has saved us for eternity.
[time=436] (soft music)
[time=455] [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=571] - Thank you very much for your singing.
[time=575] We are indeed pleased to have our hand Bell Choir with us this morning.
[time=578] We are even more pleased that the director, Rich Lidike, is here.
[time=582] On Friday afternoon, his wife gave birth to a little baby girl, Lucy.
[time=588] And we're just so glad that mother and daughter are doing fine and that Rich is able to be here.
[time=593] He lost one Bell-Ringer, but he's worked that out and we're just glad that for that family, for the opportunity to have this young child into their home now.
[time=603] Now let's listen to the Bell Choir as they play for us, a song entitled, "Holy, Holy, Holy." (bell ringing)
[time=623] (upbeat music)
[time=653] (bell ringing)
[time=726] - Thank you for joining us again today for the Bible Hour.
[time=730] We've broken away from our live morning worship service for just a few moments to tell you about some coming events in the life of our church and community.
[time=739] Joining Pete and me is a friend, Wade Holbrook.
[time=742] Wade, good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=744] - Thank you, Rick.
[time=745] We're glad to have you with us coming up on February 9th and 10th are some special musical events.
[time=750] Tell our friends just what's coming up on that weekend.
[time=754] - Well, it's gonna be a busy weekend for my wife, Katie, and I on Friday evening, February the 9th, we're gonna be hosting a vocal workshop done by Chris and Carol Beatty from Tyler, Texas.
[time=763] Chris and Carol are vocal instructors from Tyler, and they have worked with people like Steve Green, Twilight Paris, Dallas Home, Debbie Boone, all these people come to them for voice lessons, and we're gonna have the opportunity to have them here in the worship center to give a three-hour vocal workshop for anybody who would like to attend.
[time=780] - Well, who would be likely candidates if they're watching by way of television today to come to the Friday night vocal workshop?
[time=787] Anybody who has a voice for the Lord, anybody who would like to know how to properly maintain and take care of their voice, how to properly project it, breathing principles, posture, things like that for singers, speakers, anybody who gets up in front of people and wants to communicate.
[time=803] - Well, that sounds like a great opportunity.
[time=805] No doubt many friends are watching, thinking that may be what they need, how can they register, what should they do to be involved?
[time=812] - Well, if they would call me at area code 219-485-0812 and just ask for Wade Holbrook, I can send them all the information on it.
[time=819] - Why don't you give us that phone number one more time?
[time=822] - Okay, it's area code 219-485-0812.
[time=826] - Great, and then Saturday, there's an event called Sing for Joy.
[time=830] Tell us about that.
[time=832] - On Saturday morning and afternoon, we will have 40 singing soloists or groups who are the finalists in our Sing for Joy talent contest this year, and these people will be singing in the worship center, and they will be being critiqued by Chris and Carol Beatty, also Jim Rogers, who is the president of Pine Brook Recording Studio owned by Bill Gaither in Alexandria, Indiana, and Priscilla Engel, who is a vocalist from Muncie, Indiana, will be coming up here and critiquing singers as they sing, they will be scoring them, and the singers that they deem to be outstanding will appear in a public concert that evening.
[time=865] - And who will be the special guests at the public concert on Saturday night?
[time=869] - We are very fortunate this year to have the evening concert hosted by Ray Bolts, who is also from Muncie, Indiana, a well-known Christian singer and composer.
[time=878] He's written songs like Watch the Lamb, Shepherd Boy, Thank You, The Alter, he's a fantastic songwriter, and he will be hosting the evening concert, introducing the winners, they will sing their songs, and Ray will also be singing during the evening.
[time=891] - Well, that's an event to look forward to on February 9th and 10th, and all of these events will take place right here at the worship center at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=901] And then we have one of these guests joining us the next day.
[time=905] Rick, we're looking forward to that entire weekend because it's a benefit for our own church choir to get some of this instruction, and then to enjoy other soloists.
[time=913] But on Sunday morning, we'll have the privilege of having Chris Beatty right here in our worship service.
[time=918] So if you're in this area, you look forward to February 11th at 9.15 or 10.50.
[time=925] He'll be singing for us in our morning worship hour that day.
[time=929] Great, that's going to be a wonderful weekend.
[time=932] Wade, one more time, give us the phone number, so if people want to register for either Friday night or Saturday, they know how to do that.
[time=938] If they call area code 219-485-0812 and ask for Wade Holbrook, I can send them all the information in the mail.
[time=946] - Okay, well, we hope that you'll take advantage of this opportunity.
[time=950] We also have a book that we'd like to share with you an opportunity to study in depth the principles of God's Word.
[time=957] The book is titled "What a Marvelous Salvation." It has been penned by our associate pastor, Jim Pearson.
[time=964] You know, doubt if you're a regular part of the Bible or have seen him speak, he has spoken on the Bible or several times in the last few months.
[time=972] This book is a study of what the Bible teaches about salvation.
[time=977] Why is it that we need to be saved?
[time=979] What makes Jesus qualified to be our Savior?
[time=983] What must we do to have the gift of salvation?
[time=987] This is about a 30-page Bible study book and we want to send you a copy as a gift from us to you.
[time=994] You can receive this booklet today by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1005] Once again, that address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1015] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us, Wade, and thank you for being a part of the Bible hour today.
[time=1047] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=1238] Our God, you have bid us to be still and to know that I am God.
[time=1245] I will be exalted amongst the nations.
[time=1248] I will be exalted on the earth.
[time=1253] And God has prepared our heart for that truth.
[time=1256] Even as we heard a piano today, God, our own hearts give us the message.
[time=1261] Be still my soul.
[time=1265] God, we ask you to quiet us now.
[time=1268] Not with the quietness of apathy or indifference, but the quietness of contentment and resolve.
[time=1276] Help us today not to be tried in making New Year's resolutions,
[time=1282] but to be serious in making the resolve to walk with you.
[time=1287] Father, in these days, some of us are tasting the fruit of victory into sweet.
[time=1293] We rejoice and are delighted.
[time=1297] We want to pour out our hearts with thanksgiving and gratitude.
[time=1301] We want to thank you today that Jack Saylor could walk into this auditorium without the assistance of crutches.
[time=1309] We want to thank you today that Ted Ward was able to lead an ant to the assurance of eternal life.
[time=1316] We want to thank you today that you met the financial needs of this church.
[time=1321] We want to thank you today for the hundreds who are serving this hour with our children.
[time=1328] We want to thank you today for those who have had the joy of a family restored.
[time=1335] We want to thank you today for your word that it gives direction to our life.
[time=1341] We want the resolve today to enthusiastically study your word.
[time=1348] And we are still now quiet and worshiping you for all of your goodness to us.
[time=1357] And in these still quiet moments, we ask you to speak a word of comfort.
[time=1364] It's a John and Lorraine Summers and the death of his mother
[time=1371] to Carol Beebe and Karen Dwyer and the death of their mother.
[time=1377] Thank you for the assurance that those women have that their mother, though absent from them, is present with you.
[time=1384] We are thankful today that Dick Baird's surgery removed all of the cancer and would pray for his recovery.
[time=1392] We, this morning, would pray for healing of those who have found
[time=1399] the greatest, precious promises of fidelity have been broken.
[time=1405] Heal the heart and please heal the relationship.
[time=1409] Bring joy.
[time=1411] And now as we study your word, we ask you to make it real.
[time=1416] Make it relevant for our sake in Jesus, amen.
[time=1424] In my theology, I do not believe in purgatory.
[time=1429] I believe in heaven and hell, but no temporary intermediate state of purgatory.
[time=1436] But if I'm wrong, I believe that purgatory will be a large shopping mall on a busy day.
[time=1443] I can think of no greater punishment short of hell than to be forced to shop
[time=1449] at a crowded shopping center in the peak season.
[time=1454] As I've analyzed my own heart, I've come to the conclusion why I feel that way about shopping.
[time=1460] It probably goes back to my early childhood when I was about three or four years old.
[time=1465] We were shopping against my will at O'Neill's in downtown Akron.
[time=1470] O'Neill's is closed as many of the big downtown stores have gone that way in the last two decades.
[time=1477] But it was a giant massive six-floor stone building.
[time=1482] And it had those elevators.
[time=1484] You remember those elevators that one door opened and then on the inside there was a lattice metal
[time=1490] grate that a lady would open and she'd have to crank something to get you to the floor you wanted to go.
[time=1495] And they always had the frontious, grumpiest ladies running those elevators.
[time=1500] You got on what floor and you'd tell them I remember standing in O'Neill's
[time=1506] about this high next to my mother.
[time=1508] And you could hear those elevators ding as they went up each floor and you'd know what floor they were on by the dings.
[time=1515] But we were on the floor that had the toys.
[time=1519] And my mom was here and I was right next to her and I saw the toys and just kind of wandered over there
[time=1525] and became enamored with one of these toys.
[time=1528] And I heard a ding and I turned around and the elevator doors were closing.
[time=1533] And I was certain that the elevator door had just closed and my mother was on it and I was left behind.
[time=1543] Some of you are smiling and even nodding because almost every child's had one of those experiences of being left out.
[time=1550] Being left behind.
[time=1553] The book of 2 Thessalonians is written to a group of people who were afraid.
[time=1558] They'd been left out and left behind.
[time=1561] Paul had written the first letter of Thessalonians and in that letter he told them in chapter 4
[time=1568] that someday Jesus was coming again and when he came he was going to pick up all true Christians
[time=1575] and take them instantly to heaven with them.
[time=1578] And that was to be their hope. That was to be their confidence that Jesus was coming.
[time=1584] Now since they got that first letter a rumor had been started.
[time=1590] A letter had been drafted that said that Jesus not only was coming but that he did come
[time=1600] and that he'd already returned to heaven and the people of Thessaloniki were standing with their hearts broken.
[time=1611] Fearful that Jesus had come and they had been left behind.
[time=1617] Like a little boy watching the elevator doors close they thought their opportunity to meet Jesus had closed in front of them.
[time=1629] In 2 Thessalonians the Apostle Paul gives to us our confidence that Jesus is coming
[time=1637] and then tells us how we should live in light of His coming.
[time=1642] This morning we're starting the first of four messages out of this book called 2 Thessalonians.
[time=1648] One year ago right now we studied 1 Thessalonians. This is a sequel. Paul's letter and our study.
[time=1655] If you have a Bible please try to find 2 Thessalonians. Don't be embarrassed if you have to use the index at the front of your Bible.
[time=1662] It will guide you to this book.
[time=1665] Today I want to give you an overview of this epistle and then three applications that we can take home with us.
[time=1673] The reason why Paul wrote this letter was because these people had come to faith in Jesus Christ and they were suffering because they were Christians.
[time=1685] Their families had rejected them. Their community had ostracized them. Their Romans were even threatening them with capital punishment.
[time=1694] And they were suffering for Christ because they believed that He was coming again.
[time=1699] And now their faith was shaken. He's come already. We've suffered for Him and He left us.
[time=1708] They were troubled. Some were not so much troubled but they were tempted.
[time=1715] They were tempted to say no wait a minute. Let's think about this. If we really believe Jesus is coming and I mean coming soon.
[time=1723] In my mortgage payments $446, why not just spend that and go have a good time because I'm going to be raptured out of here.
[time=1733] I'll leave the mortgage payments for the bank to worry about.
[time=1738] Some of them even took it a step further and said no wait a minute. If Jesus is coming, why am I wasting my time on this crummy job working for this lousy supervisor?
[time=1747] I'm going to quit my job and I'll just live it up till Jesus comes again.
[time=1756] What would you do if you really believe that Jesus was coming again?
[time=1761] That was the question that faced them. Some of them were tempted. Some of them were troubled.
[time=1767] Let me give you a brief outline of this book and if you have the chart in the bulletin you can follow with us.
[time=1773] This book has got three chapters in it. Chapter one is encouragement to tested Christians.
[time=1781] Some of them were saying wait a minute. I'm being persecuted. I'm facing all kinds of problems.
[time=1788] What's in it for me? Paul gives them encouragement to face the testing trials that were before them.
[time=1798] In chapter two we come to the heart of the matter. Look at chapter two verses one and two very briefly.
[time=1805] Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him we ask you brothers not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy,
[time=1817] report or letter supposed to have come from us saying that the day of the Lord has already come.
[time=1825] Chapter two is an explanation to troubled Christians.
[time=1829] What had taken place is that a rumor substantiated by a letter had made its way to Thessaloniki.
[time=1838] The rumor in the letter said that Christ had already come and they were troubled.
[time=1847] In this chapter Paul explains to them that Christ has not already come and calms their troubled hearts.
[time=1855] Probably, and this is only speculation but I think it's accurate, probably someone wrote a letter saying that Christ had come and then had the audacity not to sign his own name but he put the name at the bottom the Apostle Paul.
[time=1873] In technical wording that's called a pseudo-pig graphical writing.
[time=1877] That's a big word but pseudo means false.
[time=1880] Pygrophot remains to write so it's someone writing under a false name.
[time=1885] Probably somebody sent a letter, signed it Paul and told them you missed it Jesus has been here.
[time=1892] Now at the end of this epistle look at chapter three verse seventeen.
[time=1897] The author says I Paul write this greeting in my own hand which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters.
[time=1908] This is how I write.
[time=1911] Why did he do that? Because he wanted them to know that this letter was authentic.
[time=1916] It wasn't another pseudo-piggriful letter but it was actually Paul's that his own hand had stroked the marks that they could compare it to the first letter.
[time=1926] And the notes that he sent while he lived there with him they could say this is authentic.
[time=1931] They were troubled and he now explains to them in chapter two why they need not be troubled.
[time=1937] Chapter three is an exhortation to tested Christians.
[time=1941] Those who were tested in their faith and tempted and the temptation was to quit their job, the default on their loan and to live it up because Jesus is coming.
[time=1955] In this epistle he teaches us how to live in light of Christ's return.
[time=1966] Let me ask you this.
[time=1968] What would you do if you knew this was the last year before Christ returned?
[time=1975] If you somehow knew that late 1990 Jesus will return.
[time=1982] How would you use this year?
[time=1984] Would you say I've always wanted to go to Hawaii and I'm going to save up my money and I'm going to get there in 1990?
[time=1990] Last chance.
[time=1992] Will you take out a pin and go over here will and say I'm not going to leave this to my son.
[time=1998] I'm not going to leave this to my daughter.
[time=2000] I'm not going to leave this to the university.
[time=2002] That's my alma mater.
[time=2003] I'm going to rewrite my will.
[time=2005] I believe that Jesus is coming in 1990, spend it all.
[time=2011] How would you spend this last year?
[time=2014] If this was the last year of the earth's history before Christ returned, what would you want to tell your children?
[time=2023] What would you want to say to your neighbors?
[time=2026] What message would you want to give to a world that's facing its terminal hour?
[time=2034] What if you knew that Jesus was coming in one month?
[time=2040] What if you knew that there were about 30 days left in the history of the globe?
[time=2045] How would you use those days?
[time=2048] Would you seek to have that one final thrill?
[time=2051] Would you go for all the gusto?
[time=2054] Would you live as Howard Coel would say with reckless abandonment?
[time=2059] Would you become conservative?
[time=2061] Would you count the hours?
[time=2063] Would you get out of calendar and with despair mark off each day?
[time=2068] 30, 29, 28, 27, it's ending?
[time=2074] What message would you want to share in that final day with your family?
[time=2081] What if you knew this was the last day that Jesus would come today?
[time=2088] What would you do today?
[time=2090] What urgency would fill your body?
[time=2095] Would you be ready to meet him?
[time=2099] Would you be ready as a family to say we are together in our faith in Jesus Christ
[time=2106] if he were to come today, we know how to live?
[time=2110] That's what this book is about.
[time=2112] It's about living in light of Christ's return.
[time=2116] I want to give you some balancing principles today.
[time=2120] Principle number one is the simple principle.
[time=2123] We should never assume that Jesus is coming today.
[time=2131] Because we have to manage our life as though he might come today, but he might not come for another hundred years.
[time=2138] We should never assume that it's today.
[time=2142] We shouldn't go spend all of our money, we shouldn't break relationships off.
[time=2146] We shouldn't say I'm sure that it's now and I'll live my life under the assumption that it's today.
[time=2153] But the second balancing principle that I want to give you is we should never presume that we'll have tomorrow.
[time=2160] We should never presume that I don't have to worry about my finances.
[time=2164] Next year I'm going to get a raise and I'll pay for it all then.
[time=2168] I'll know that there'll be a next year.
[time=2170] You should never say I don't want to talk to that person about religion, about faith in Christ because that always goes down hard.
[time=2178] I'll do it tomorrow.
[time=2180] Never assume that it will be today, but never presume that you'll have tomorrow.
[time=2186] It's very much of a balancing act.
[time=2190] I'd like to share with you three principles now.
[time=2195] If Jesus is coming tomorrow, how should I live today?
[time=2200] These principles are actually a summary of each of the three chapters of 2 Thessalonians.
[time=2206] So principle number one from chapter number one is this.
[time=2210] Expect to suffer in the world.
[time=2219] As Christians we make two glaring errors.
[time=2223] Number number one is this.
[time=2225] I believe that Jesus is coming before the tribulation.
[time=2228] Therefore I won't have any tribulation in life.
[time=2232] Wrong.
[time=2234] Jesus is coming before the great tribulation, but Jesus said in this life you will have tribulation.
[time=2244] You're going to face hard times.
[time=2247] The rapture is not a promise that God will individually rescue us from every trial, every dilemma in life.
[time=2256] Mistake number two that we make as Christians is to believe that if I give my heart to Jesus, everything will be okay.
[time=2265] I read this little pamphlet.
[time=2267] It had four laws and law one says God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life.
[time=2276] That's true.
[time=2278] We just have to define what wonderful is.
[time=2282] God says wonderful is going through the trials and the testing and the temptations of life and ultimately being rewarded in heaven.
[time=2291] But wonderful is not that your son doesn't get leukemia.
[time=2295] Wonderful is not that your husband promises and lives up to every one of his promises.
[time=2303] Because believers in Christ we must expect to suffer in the world.
[time=2310] And we should expect to suffer in two categories.
[time=2314] Number one is we should expect to be persecuted.
[time=2319] Let me read for you John chapter 15 beginning in verse 18.
[time=2324] This is what Jesus said to his disciples.
[time=2328] Excuse me.
[time=2330] I'm in the right place? Yes, John 15, 18.
[time=2333] He writes.
[time=2335] If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
[time=2341] If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own.
[time=2347] As it is, you do not belong to the world.
[time=2350] But I have chosen you out of the world.
[time=2352] That is why the world hates you.
[time=2356] Remember the words I spoke to you.
[time=2359] A folk servant is greater than his master.
[time=2361] If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also.
[time=2367] We should expect to be persecuted for our faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2373] And we are the generation that is the cultural exception.
[time=2381] Because Christianity has been the dominant cultural influence in the United States.
[time=2386] You and I are not overtly persecuted for our faith in Christ.
[time=2390] But they are at this very moment in Nepal.
[time=2394] In Nepal today, there will be pastors who will be put in prison for teaching what I am teaching you.
[time=2401] There will be parishioners who will be executed today in Nepal because of their faith in Christ.
[time=2408] If the parishionaries can go into northern Thailand, then the pastors in Nepal must sneak through the Himalayas that come and be trained.
[time=2416] And then at risk of their life, they go back across the border.
[time=2420] They are persecuted.
[time=2422] We are the exception.
[time=2427] 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 tells us to expect persecution.
[time=2432] Here is verse 4 of 2 Thessalonians 1.
[time=2436] Among God's churches, we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.
[time=2448] 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 12 tells us that persecution is not at the exception, it's the norm.
[time=2456] Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[time=2465] But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
[time=2477] Some of you today are suffering persecution for Christ.
[time=2481] Some of you have a boss who purposely makes your life as miserable as he can because you resent your faith in Christ.
[time=2492] Some of you today are married to a spouse who is not a believer.
[time=2497] And every opportunity they have, they make an issue out of your faith in Christ.
[time=2504] Some of you have come from a very strict religious background.
[time=2508] And when you came to Christ, your family rejected you.
[time=2511] You said you wanted to be a part of the family that you still loved them, but when you left their denomination,
[time=2518] when you left their background, they rejected you.
[time=2523] We should expect to suffer in the world being persecuted.
[time=2531] But there's a second reason why we should expect to suffer in the world, and that is because the world is filled with problems.
[time=2540] The world in which we live in will be beset by catastrophic event after catastrophic event.
[time=2547] Hurricanes will sweep across the island of Jamaica, and another hurricane will blast the coast of Carolina.
[time=2555] Earthquakes will shape the great cities that are anywhere near the San Andreas Fault.
[time=2561] Tidal waves will roll over islands in Manila.
[time=2566] The world will have problems not only of the catastrophic nature, but of the microcosmic nature.
[time=2574] Little viruses can enter your body and trigger reactions within the cells of your own soul.
[time=2584] And your body will begin to accelerate the production of cells, and Burkett's lymphoma can take over your body and take your life.
[time=2596] You can take a deep breath that's humidified air, and the water that was used in that humidifier sat too long in a reservoir,
[time=2607] and bacteria grew in Legionnaire's disease will fill your lungs.
[time=2612] You see, the world we live in is not heaven. It's not Eden.
[time=2616] It's a world that is twisted and filled with problems, and we will not escape them.
[time=2622] Jesus taught that in a graphic way in Luke chapter 13. Allow me to read these verses to you.
[time=2631] Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood
[time=2637] Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?
[time=2648] I tell you, no. But unless you repent, you too will all perish."
[time=2654] Are those 18 who died when the tower fell on them?
[time=2657] Do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?
[time=2661] I tell you, no.
[time=2665] What happened was this, Pilate, the tyrant took some people and each sacrificed them
[time=2672] and then took their blood and mixed it with his pagan godly acts as he worshipped Zeus, Jupiter.
[time=2683] People said, "Jesus, wasn't that a terrible thing that happened to those people?" Jesus said, "Don't think for a moment that that hit them because they're worse than anybody else.
[time=2690] That's just part of living on the globe." Jesus said, "Those people who were killed when the tower fell over don't think they were worse than you or you or you or me."
[time=2700] They were just cut down because they live in the world that's full of problems.
[time=2706] Tirens will rise up and towers will fall down and people will get cut in the crossfire.
[time=2714] Just because we live on a globe that is in chaos,
[time=2722] that has been put into poetry by Grammy Award nominee Billy Joel and his hit,
[time=2731] "We Didn't Start the Fire." Listen to how he describes the problems of living on the globe.
[time=2737] Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnny Ray, South Pacific, Walter Wancho, Joe DiMaggio,
[time=2744] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studer Baker, Television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe,
[time=2750] Rosenbergs, H. Bomb, Sugar Ray, Pomon John, Brando, the King and I, the catcher in the rye.
[time=2756] Eisenhower vaccine, England's got a new queen, Marciana, Libra, Rachisana, and a goodbye.
[time=2762] We didn't start the fire.
[time=2764] It's always burning since the world's been turning.
[time=2767] We didn't start the fire.
[time=2769] No, we didn't light it, but we have to fight it.
[time=2772] Birth control, hoochie men, Richard Nixon back again, moonshot, woodstock, watergate, punk rock,
[time=2778] baggan, raggan, Palestine, terror on the airline.
[time=2782] Ayatollahs in Iran, Russians in Afghanistan, Wheel of Fortune, Sally Ride, heavy metal suicide,
[time=2788] foreign debts, homeless vets, AIDS crack, Bernie gets, hyperdermics on the shores, China's under martial law, rock and roll, cola wars.
[time=2796] I can't take it anymore.
[time=2798] We didn't start the fire.
[time=2800] It's always burning since the world's been turning on us.
[time=2804] We didn't start the fire, but when we're gone, it'll still burn on and on and on.
[time=2813] It's the world we live in.
[time=2815] It's not Eden.
[time=2818] And you and I are not exempt because we're believers in Christ.
[time=2824] We will not only face persecution, but we will face the hard times of just living on a planet
[time=2831] that's out of control.
[time=2833] If Jesus is coming back tomorrow, how should we live today?
[time=2838] We should live expecting to suffer in the world.
[time=2843] Now let me give you a second principle from chapter two.
[time=2845] It is this one.
[time=2847] Enthusiastically study the Word.
[time=2852] We've already read chapter two verses one and two where they thought they had received a letter,
[time=2859] and this letter had greatly troubled them.
[time=2862] Jesus had come and we had missed out.
[time=2866] Why were they so susceptible?
[time=2868] Why were they so gullible?
[time=2870] The Thessalonikians were not good students of the Word.
[time=2876] In fact, they are used as a negative example in the book of Acts.
[time=2881] You know, some cities are used as a negative example.
[time=2884] I grew up outside of Cleveland, and there are Cleveland jokes constantly.
[time=2889] Even the comedian, Yakov Smirnoff, says, you know, every country has a city they make fun of, like you Americans make fun of Cleveland?
[time=2897] Well, back in the Soviet Union, we make fun of Cleveland.
[time=2900] And they're just cities that develop that reputation.
[time=2903] The Thessalonikians were that type of city.
[time=2907] In Acts chapter 17, they get a real shot in the ribs.
[time=2912] In praising the church of Berea, Paul said this.
[time=2916] The people of Berea were more noble than those of Thessaloniki, for they searched the scriptures to see if these things were so.
[time=2926] You know, Paul was telling us there.
[time=2928] He was not only telling us about the noble Bereans, but he was telling us about the gullible Thessalonikians.
[time=2934] When Paul came there and he preached the gospel to them, they believed.
[time=2937] But when somebody else came with a different message, they believed that one too.
[time=2941] Why was that?
[time=2943] Because they didn't study the word and search to see if these things were true.
[time=2949] Look at chapter 2, verse 15 for the key principle that comes out.
[time=2954] So then brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you,
[time=2961] whether by word or mouth or letter.
[time=2966] This was a body of people who took teaching too lightly, who handled the scriptures too loosely,
[time=2973] and were sensationally impressed with anyone who came around with a good message.
[time=2979] And they swallowed it, "hook, line and sinker."
[time=2985] Because they failed to enthusiastically study God's word.
[time=2991] That's the second principle that we would give in how to live if Jesus is coming back,
[time=2997] enthusiastically study the word that we then are to stand firm and hold on to the teachings.
[time=3006] Then the problem was this false letter drafted erroneously under the name of Paul that wasn't true
[time=3016] and had misled a whole church.
[time=3020] Now in our generation there is a similar problem because we are not students of the word
[time=3026] and not able to rightly divide the word of truth.
[time=3030] There are all kinds of false teachers receiving great acclaim, not only in this generation
[time=3038] but in this generation of Christians.
[time=3043] It falls under the generic heading of the New Age Movement.
[time=3049] The New Age Movement is an eclectic religion.
[time=3053] Eclecticism is the indiscriminate blending of beliefs.
[time=3059] So if you are in a New Age Movement study, you will find that they believe in Jesus.
[time=3065] Oh, they must be Christians.
[time=3067] Oh, they also believe in all other prophets.
[time=3070] Well, they believe that there is eternal life, just like we believe.
[time=3074] They also believe eternal life is reincarnation.
[time=3078] They believe in prayer, but if you really want to be in tune, you ought to learn Zen Buddhism.
[time=3084] You see, the New Age Movement is just grabbing a little bit of everything that comes along
[time=3091] and packages it and it has broad appeal to a society that has a little bit of knowledge
[time=3099] but do not seriously study the word.
[time=3105] In fact, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
[time=3110] The Bible says that Jesus is coming again.
[time=3113] The New Age Movement says in the year 2000, all things will become new that there will be a rise of an evil power
[time=3119] but look to the sky because your salvation is coming.
[time=3122] Extra-terrestrials are going to come rescue us.
[time=3127] Some of you are saying, "No, wait a minute. I read some New Age books and they did not say that." That is because the New Age Movement will tolerate and embrace anything.
[time=3136] You can be in the New Age Movement and believe in eternal life.
[time=3142] It is eclectic in grabbing everything and of all books selling at the close of the last decade
[time=3151] the New Age Movement outsold them all.
[time=3155] And it is grabbing a hold of a society that is hungry and searching for the truth but not serious enough to study the Scripture.
[time=3165] The Bible tells us that one of the signs that will precede the return of Christ is a falling away from the truth.
[time=3175] And people don't fall away by going in one day from believing the Bible to believing nothing in the Bible.
[time=3183] They fall away by blending the Bible with all kinds of other religions,
[time=3189] which is the word of baptism under a great title, the New Age.
[time=3195] If Jesus is coming, then we should be enthusiastically studying His Word.
[time=3204] The third principle I would share with you comes from chapter three.
[time=3209] It is this one.
[time=3211] Eagerly serve at work.
[time=3216] I have already told you some of them were tempted to say, "Hey, if Jesus is coming, I am going to bag this lousy job." Look at chapter three verses 11 and 12.
[time=3228] He says, "We hear that there are some among you who are idle." Notice this parallelism.
[time=3235] They are not busy, they are busy bodies.
[time=3239] Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and to earn the bread they eat.
[time=3248] Isn't that a good principle?
[time=3250] I think we ought to mail it to Washington, D.C.
[time=3253] You ought to earn the bread that you eat.
[time=3259] If Jesus is coming back, then we should eagerly serve at work.
[time=3266] We shouldn't quit our jobs, but with enthusiasm and eagerness we ought to serve.
[time=3271] We very quickly give you three reasons why your work is important.
[time=3275] Reason number one is this.
[time=3276] Your work matters to God.
[time=3280] Work is not the punishment for the fall.
[time=3285] God didn't create Eden free of work and then after Adam and Eve sin
[time=3291] say, "All right, your punishment is you've got to go to work." Before the fall, God ordained work.
[time=3299] Genesis 2, verse 15, "The Lord took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." Don't think for a minute that your work doesn't matter to God.
[time=3312] Don't think because you're in the insurance business and I'm in the assurance business that my work matters to God but yours doesn't.
[time=3320] Not true.
[time=3321] Don't think for a moment that if you teach music in a secular school that your teaching isn't important is Rich Lydia Keys who teaches in law school.
[time=3330] Your work is important to God.
[time=3333] Don't think for a moment if you sell stocks and securities that your work doesn't matter to God
[time=3339] only those who peddle eternal security matter to God.
[time=3344] Not true.
[time=3345] God created us and before the fall he created us to work and when you work hard it pleases him.
[time=3354] A second reason why your work is important is because it matters to you.
[time=3361] Solomon was the first existentialist.
[time=3364] Nearly 2,000 years before Soren Kierkegaard he asked the question what's it all about?
[time=3370] And he went through the experiments of life.
[time=3373] Would meaning come through pleasure?
[time=3379] Where does a man find his meaning in life?
[time=3382] At the end of it he said the chief duty of man.
[time=3386] What brings it all together is to fear God and obey his commandments.
[time=3390] But along the way he drops this nugget of truth.
[time=3394] Ecclesiastes 9 verse 10.
[time=3396] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all of your might.
[time=3401] For in the grave where you are going there is neither work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
[time=3406] What was he trying to say?
[time=3409] He said he was a rich king who never had to work but he said in this life a measure of meaning.
[time=3415] A measure of self-worth comes from our work.
[time=3419] I need to put a balance on there if you're a workaholic.
[time=3422] Don't work to the neglect of your spiritual life, your emotional life or your family life.
[time=3429] Third reason why your work is important because it matters to your witness.
[time=3434] 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 says verse 11, make it your ambition to lead a quiet life to mind your own business
[time=3441] and to work with your hands just as we told you so that your daily life may win the respective outsiders
[time=3448] and so that you will not be dependent upon anybody.
[time=3451] If Jesus is coming again, how should I live?
[time=3456] 1. Expect a suffer in the world. 2. Enthusiastically study his word. 3. Eagerly serve at work.
[time=3468] We've been sharing with you today music with a message of assurance from our sanctuary choir,
[time=3482] the handbells and pianist Scott Schindler.
[time=3485] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3494] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this day and I thank you for this opportunity to come to you
[time=3500] and to say to you that I need a Savior.
[time=3503] I ask you to come into my heart today and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3508] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3512] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3517] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3525] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the study booklet entitled "What a Marvelous Salvation",
[time=3531] please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
