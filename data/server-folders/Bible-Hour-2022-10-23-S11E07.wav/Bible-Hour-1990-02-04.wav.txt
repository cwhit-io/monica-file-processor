[time=73] A Midwestern lawyer started two different businesses that were failures.
[time=79] On seven different occasions, he ran for elected office and was defeated.
[time=86] But he was no failure.
[time=88] He refused to quit. His name was Abraham Lincoln.
[time=94] [MUSIC]
[time=103] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=107] Thank you for joining us.
[time=109] Rick's message today is entitled, "It is Too Soon to Quit." Abraham Lincoln was a man of remarkable perseverance.
[time=116] Failures in business and defeats in elections would discourage him, but not destroy him.
[time=121] He refused to quit. As believers, we will face failures and defeat.
[time=126] Our faith will be tested and our soul will be put on trial.
[time=130] God's word tells us to press on, to not give up.
[time=134] In today's lesson, we will discover three principles to help us keep going in the tough times.
[time=140] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us from the book of 2 Thessalonians.
[time=145] We'll be looking at chapter 1 verses 1 through 12.
[time=149] Special music today includes a song from the Men's Singers Quartet and a solo from Marilyn Wong.
[time=158] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "There Is a Savior."
[time=165] [MUSIC - 215 seconds]
[time=400] â™ª What a comforting thought that the Lord is our Savior, our Shepherd, and He gently leads us.
[time=412] There's a hymn in our hymnal that is so familiar to most of us.
[time=415] We've sung for many years in the Christian Church.
[time=418] Savior, like a Shepherd lead us, hymn number 462.
[time=421] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas.
[time=424] Sing it together, please.
[time=426] [MUSIC - 125 seconds]
[time=575] A wonderful comfort in that last verse that he talks about, the love that he had for us at the beginning, and his continual love for us.
[time=583] And when we look at the mountains of circumstances that surround us from day to day,
[time=589] we ask the question, "Who can move those mountains and who can give us relief?" It is Jesus. He's the One.
[time=596] [MUSIC]
[time=604] Who can move the mountains that are hindering you today?
[time=611] Who can pick them up like pebbles, clear them from the way?
[time=618] Who can prove his power when a Christian meals to pray?
[time=624] It is Jesus. He's the One. He's the One.
[time=632] Jesus holds all power in his mighty hands divine.
[time=639] He's the One who heal the sick, turn water into wine.
[time=646] He makes all things possible, and he's a friend of mine.
[time=652] Blessed Jesus, he's the One.
[time=659] Who can heal the heartache that is crushing you within?
[time=666] Who can pour the balm of heaven where the hurt has been?
[time=673] Who can chase the shadows, make the song of joy begin?
[time=679] It is Jesus. He's the One. He's the One.
[time=686] Jesus holds all power in his mighty hands divine.
[time=693] He's the One who heal the sick, turn water into wine.
[time=700] He makes all things possible, and he's a friend of mine.
[time=706] Blessed Jesus, he's the One, the only one.
[time=713] Who can give you from all harm and guide you by the hand?
[time=720] Who can give you heart or service and the strength to send?
[time=727] Who can give you grace for all that living may depend?
[time=733] It is Jesus. He's the One, the One.
[time=740] Jesus holds all power in his mighty hands divine.
[time=747] He's the One who heal the sick, turn water into wine.
[time=754] He makes all things possible, and he's a friend of mine.
[time=760] Blessed Jesus, he's the One.
[time=784] We are so thankful that you have joined us today for the Bible hour.
[time=792] We hope that this hour is a time of great encouragement in your life.
[time=797] I want to take a few moments to share with you special events coming up in the life of our church and community.
[time=803] Pete, we have a big weekend coming up with music on February the 9th, 10th and 11th.
[time=808] Right, Rick, we've combined with Anchor Room Bookstore and Wade Holbrook, who is in charge of the music area there to create a workshop, a choral contest, and then a concert on February 9th and 10th.
[time=821] On February 9th, there'll be a workshop here for vocalists right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church from 7 p.m. until 10 p.m. with Chris Beatty.
[time=830] Chris Beatty is a vocal coach for many of the musicians that you hear on our local radio broadcasts and is a fine vocal coach.
[time=839] He'll be with us if you're interested in improving your vocal ability for the Lord.
[time=845] You might just make note of that time on February 9th.
[time=849] And then on February 10th, we'll have the Sing For Joy Choral Contest with small ensembles and soloists singing throughout the entire day in our worship center.
[time=859] You can kind of come and go as you please during the day and listen to all of these contestants during the day.
[time=866] And then at 7 p.m., one of the judges that is here for the entire day, Ray Bolts, will host a concert.
[time=872] He will be singing along with Priscilla Engle and some of the winners throughout the day, and that will be a great choral concert.
[time=880] That's February 10th at 7 p.m. right here at the worship center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=886] If you're interested in more information, you might call Wade Holbrook at 4850812, and he can give you more detailed information concerning the entire weekend.
[time=899] Well, that'll be a time to look forward to. The concert with Ray Bolts, I'm sure, will be an encouragement to everyone.
[time=905] You may not recognize his name, but I'm sure you would recognize his music.
[time=910] He is the gentleman who has both written and performed songs such as Watch The Lamb and Thank You, some of the most meaningful and best received songs of the last few years.
[time=922] On that Sunday, February the 11th, Chris Beatty will be staying over and singing in our morning worship service.
[time=928] Here at Black Hawk, we're calling it a friend day, encouraging our people to invite friends to church.
[time=934] We also want you to know that it's an open house, a time when we want to ask you friends who watch us by way of television who could go to church to come worship with us on that morning of February 11th.
[time=946] We have two morning worship services. The first is at 915, and the second is at 1050, and we'd love to meet you live and in person.
[time=957] Also on that same weekend, on the morning of February the 10th, Charles Colson will be here in Fort Wayne, and we just wanted to use our ministry to promote his.
[time=968] God has used Chuck Colson in a great way, first with prison fellowship and also as an author. He has written such books as Born Again, Loving God, and Against the Darkness.
[time=979] He is truly one of the inspirational Christian writers of this day, and he's equally as great of a communicator.
[time=986] And you'll want to save that morning of February the 10th to be with Charles Colson. We'll share more details with you as the time grows closer.
[time=994] Finally, before we go back to our morning worship service, we want to encourage you to write for a helpful Bible study tool called What a Marvelous Salvation.
[time=1004] Jim Pearson of our staff has put this 30-page booklet together. It is a Bible study over the doctrine of salvation.
[time=1012] One of Paul's concerns and prayers was that the church might grow to maturity and not be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine.
[time=1022] Well, we're living in a time when the winds of change are blowing, and people are moving from their roots in God's Word to religions that are springing up and then just as quickly rolling away, and they're getting lost in the shuffle.
[time=1038] You need to be anchored in the Word, and particularly in the doctrine of salvation. If you'd like a copy of this book, it's free. You simply need to write and ask for it.
[time=1048] Write for the booklet What a Marvelous Salvation to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1068] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1098] A beautiful, beautiful home. Oh, sweet home. Oh, sweet home, where I'll never run.
[time=1127] I see the light in that city so bright in my own sweet home.
[time=1147] Loved ones upon that shore I'll meet, cast in their crowns at Jesus' feet. I'll worship and praise Him forevermore in my beautiful, beautiful home.
[time=1176] Oh, sweet home. Oh, sweet home, where I'll never run.
[time=1196] I see the light of that city so bright in my home. Oh, sweet home.
[time=1224] Thank you, Marilyn, and could I invite you to pray with me? Our Father, we have been taught in a song today that Heaven is our home, and yet we have labored this week to hang wallpaper, to paint a room, to recarpet a floor, to mend a fence.
[time=1244] Our houses, they too are our homes. We want to thank you for the gift of housing and of heat, of comfort, prosperity that we know here in America.
[time=1258] We want to thank you that we live in view of eternity. Help us to never forget that we are just passing through these houses, this country, this life.
[time=1270] Today, we are reminded and asked you to imprint it permanently on our heart that Heaven is our home.
[time=1278] Help us to have the wisdom to reorder our priorities, our values, our expenditures in light of eternity.
[time=1286] Help us to have the strength to cope with the hard times, knowing that there is more to life than 70 years in the grave.
[time=1294] Help us today to accept the trials and the tribulations as those tests that make us taller and more mature spiritually.
[time=1304] We do ask for your peace and your comfort in those hard times. We pray for Phyllis Madee as she recovers in the hospital in Ohio.
[time=1314] For Anne Staudis, she battles for her health. For a friend named Bob, who has become so depressed, he toys with taking his own life.
[time=1324] We'd ask you to give comfort to little Amy Moore. She can't move her body, and yet it responds only in pain.
[time=1333] We ask you to comfort a mother and a father, an extended family as they go through the hard times.
[time=1340] We thank you to Greg Hindell's home from the hospital that Lorraine Summer's surgery was effective and Dick Beards was equally as effective.
[time=1350] We would ask you through your word to give us power to hang in there and to grow and to glorify you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1362] There was a lawyer here living in the Midwest who had started a business and it folded. He started a second business and it collapsed.
[time=1373] He then ran for public office and was defeated. And over the score of 20 years, he was defeated for public office seven different times.
[time=1386] He was discouraged. He was depressed. He had within himself an urge to simply fold, to give up and to say, "I quit."
[time=1400] But for an eighth time, he ran for public office and Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States of America.
[time=1410] Within each one of us, there will be battles. Within each one of us, there will be a voice that says, "I quit. I have failed. I have been rejected too many times."
[time=1424] We're on the birth of a new decade. We're at the beginning of a new year. And with that comes tremendous opportunities. There are always the doomsayers. Those that say, "The economy is going to grow bad. There's a recession around the corner. We're going to find depression."
[time=1442] Although those that are going to say global heating by the year 2000 is going to turn the artics into a tropic. There may be some truth.
[time=1452] But also as we approach the year 2000, there are also great opportunities. There is the potential of an economic boom around the Pacific Rim that will turn nations that have only been nations of producers and the nations of consumers and the demand for American goods may soar in the 1990s.
[time=1471] But regardless of what happens in the economy and what happens on the globe, you and I will face both good times and we will face tough times.
[time=1483] This year, simply by the sheer size of this crowd, someone here will go through the tough time. Someone here this year who is sitting with their health perfectly intact will discover that they have cancer.
[time=1501] Someone here this very morning is going to face the tough times in 1990 and they will walk that impossible walk behind the casket carrying their spouse to be buried in the grave.
[time=1518] Some of us here have already heard. Others of us will hear these words in 1990. Your job is being eliminated. Our company is closing its doors. We no longer need your services. You've done a good job, but we don't have a position for you. You will face the tough times.
[time=1544] Some of you here are sitting with the greatest joy in your life being your family. Before this year is over, you will discover that your son or your daughter is rebellious and they are prodigal and they will break your heart not once, but again and again.
[time=1561] You will face the tough times. Some of you here in this year will face abandonment. Your spouse will leave you.
[time=1573] They will depart. Some will depart trying to be gracious. Others will depart with great hostility and you will face the tough times.
[time=1584] This morning from 2 Thessalonians chapter 1, I believe that there are three principles that we must remember if we're going to hang on through the tough times.
[time=1596] I'd like to read the passage for you in sections. At first run I would like to give us 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 1 through 4 and we'll pull the first principle from that text.
[time=1610] Paul, Silas and Timothy to the church of Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1625] We ought always to thank God for you brothers and rightly so because your faith is growing more and more and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.
[time=1638] Therefore, amongst God's churches we post about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.
[time=1650] The first principle that we must remember is this. Remember that praise motivates. Remember that praise motivates.
[time=1661] Paul could have written a letter to this church telling them of all the things that they messed up and they had messed up.
[time=1668] He had taught them very clearly about the second coming of Christ but they messed up.
[time=1673] They thought that Christ had already come and they had been left out.
[time=1677] Paul taught them very diligently even by his own example to work and to work hard and they quit their jobs and said hey if Jesus is coming forget this crummy place.
[time=1688] They quit work. They had messed up.
[time=1692] Paul could have said I sent you guys out to mess up and you messed up on the way out. You're such louses.
[time=1699] But he doesn't do that. Instead he encourages them and he praises them for what they were doing well.
[time=1708] If you've ever played sports you probably had a coach like this. I did in my sophomore year of high school.
[time=1714] He was a good coach and he got a lot out of us.
[time=1718] One of the requirements was that if you wanted to be on our swim team you had to be a practice before school at six in the morning.
[time=1725] He was a disciplinarian and he didn't mean coming to practice at six. He didn't mean coming into the pool at six. He met in the water at six.
[time=1734] And about once a month to illustrate his point he locked the door to the pool at one minute till six.
[time=1741] Now that was all fine but what he did next always bugged me.
[time=1746] He would lock the door and then say to those of us who were on time this team is never going to be any good.
[time=1753] If you guys don't show up on time I want to say I'm here on time man open the door and yell at those guys.
[time=1760] The one principle that coach missed was that praise motivates.
[time=1765] What he should have done is said there are a bunch of turkeys outside.
[time=1768] Listen you can hear him clon at the door saying coach I'm sorry we're late.
[time=1772] He said you guys are the winners.
[time=1774] He could have said you guys are on time but instead he criticized when he should have praised.
[time=1781] Paul Smart here.
[time=1783] He looks at a group of people who had some successes and some failures and he praises them for what they were doing well.
[time=1791] Now the most important thing about praise is that it has to be well founded in sincere.
[time=1798] So he begins with this statement in verse three.
[time=1800] We ought always to thank God for you brothers and rightfully so because.
[time=1807] There's nothing worse than false praise or hollow flattery.
[time=1812] You'll never encourage somebody when they've done a bad job to call bad job a good job.
[time=1817] They'll see through it and that only makes them feel worse.
[time=1821] A friend of mine coached a summer baseball team of high school students.
[time=1825] He was an excellent coach and he always tried to encourage them.
[time=1829] In fact he went to every one of his players house to give them their final statistics and thank them for being on the team and tell them what a good job they have done.
[time=1838] On his statistics sheet he had abbreviations R for runs, RBI for runs batted in, HR for home runs and he would show the guys how they had done.
[time=1850] He was making his last visit and this guy hadn't done well at all.
[time=1855] No home runs, no RBI's, a very few number of hits.
[time=1860] He was trying to find some way of encouraging this boy when his mother walked in the room looked at the statistics and said,
[time=1866] "Honey, don't feel bad about those other things." It says here on the church that you had more Essos than everybody else.
[time=1875] "Honey, what's an Esso?" He said a strike out.
[time=1880] That mother's encouragement didn't help that young boy at all.
[time=1884] You don't want to lead the team in strikeouts.
[time=1887] Praise has to have some substance to it.
[time=1891] Paul's got some substance. He praises them for three things.
[time=1895] First thing he praises them for is the fact that their faith was intensifying.
[time=1901] These were people who were going through hard times, but their faith was growing more intense.
[time=1910] He said, "I praise you because your faith is growing more and more."
[time=1916] Instead of turning away from Christ, they were turning to him.
[time=1921] That's what the tough times are going to do in our life.
[time=1924] They're either going to make us turn away from Christ in bitterness, or they're going to make us turn towards Christ and will become better.
[time=1934] When you go through the tough time, you will have a challenge to your faith that you will either dampen it or intensify it.
[time=1944] Paul praised them because their faith was intensifying.
[time=1947] Secondly, he praised them because their love was increasing.
[time=1952] Verse 3, "Because your faith is growing more and more, and the love each and every one of you has for each other is increasing."
[time=1962] In spite of their differences, in spite of their diversities, in spite of their past hurts, these people loved each other more and more.
[time=1974] They were becoming one. They were a body in Christ.
[time=1979] Thirdly, he praises them because their perseverance was inspiring.
[time=1985] Verse 4, "Therefore, among God's churches, we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and the trials you are enduring."
[time=1998] He was bragging about them because they had the commodity of spiritual perseverance.
[time=2006] Perseverance is not passively accepting the inevitable.
[time=2012] Perseverance is actively staying in a difficult situation.
[time=2020] These people, instead of turning their back, falling away spiritually, actively stood their ground with and for Christ.
[time=2030] They were persevering.
[time=2033] The Bible tells us that God uses the hard times in our life to produce growth.
[time=2043] If you're an athlete today, you will never grow stronger. You'll never grow more agile by watching TV and eating corn chips.
[time=2052] It won't happen.
[time=2054] The only way it will happen is if you put yourself to the test and you run the laps, you pump the iron.
[time=2062] You put yourself through the pain before you get the gain.
[time=2066] If you want to be a musician of accomplishment, you will have to make great sacrifice.
[time=2073] There was a violinist who played before a greatly impressed audience.
[time=2079] One lady came up to him afterwards and said, "I'd give my life to be able to play the violin like you."
[time=2085] He said, "Madam, I did." If you want to accomplish anything in life, athletically, musically, academically, in your home, in your marriage,
[time=2097] you're going to have to invest sacrificially in it.
[time=2100] If you want to grow to maturity in Christ, you are going to have to go through God's formula.
[time=2108] It is this formula.
[time=2110] We grow taller through testing.
[time=2114] Let me show you that in Romans 5. Listen as I read verses 3 through 5.
[time=2120] And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
[time=2124] Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings.
[time=2128] Strange statement.
[time=2130] We rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance.
[time=2137] Perseverance character and character hope. And hope does not disappoint us because God has poured his love into our hearts
[time=2147] by the Holy Spirit whom he has given to us.
[time=2150] Here's God's formula.
[time=2152] He wants you to grow.
[time=2156] And what he says is, "Hocks, I'm going to send some tough times into your life.
[time=2160] I'm going to send some challenges into your life.
[time=2163] I'm going to make life difficult for you because that's going to make you stronger.
[time=2169] It's going to build perseverance.
[time=2171] And after perseverance begins to mature, it's going to be not only the exception, but it's going to be the norm in your life.
[time=2180] And that's called character.
[time=2182] And when you've got character, you'll have hope and you'll never be disappointed.
[time=2187] You'll never be ashamed.
[time=2189] James chapter one echoes the same statement.
[time=2194] Consider it pure joy when you win the lottery.
[time=2198] That's how it goes on the TV.
[time=2200] You want to be happy?
[time=2201] Buy a lottery ticket.
[time=2203] You want to be happy?
[time=2204] Purchase this product and drink six of them by half time.
[time=2209] Here's what God says.
[time=2210] You want to be happy?
[time=2212] Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
[time=2223] Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.
[time=2230] God sends the tough times because we grow taller through testing.
[time=2235] God wants us to grow.
[time=2239] Do you know what, as a father, I want my three children to grow.
[time=2246] My children have the privilege that if they are not the smallest, they are at least second smallest in their respective classes.
[time=2255] That doesn't bother me.
[time=2258] Here's what bothers me.
[time=2260] It's totally selfish.
[time=2262] We are spoiled.
[time=2263] We go to Florida every year through the generosity of some friends who have a home there.
[time=2268] We've got an annual vacation to Florida.
[time=2271] We've discovered this amusement park where for less than a cost to get into the land of the little mouse,
[time=2277] we can buy a pass that's good for as many times as you want to go.
[time=2281] We go to this amusement park about eight times in ten days for half of the day.
[time=2289] Here's the problem.
[time=2291] You have to be 48 inches tall to go on the good rides.
[time=2297] But when you're 42 inches tall, you can go on the good rides if your dad will go with you.
[time=2307] Adam is 42 inches tall.
[time=2310] His dad gets motion sick.
[time=2314] This is a true story.
[time=2317] We went to the amusement park.
[time=2320] We found out that Adam could ride this ride called the Enterprise.
[time=2326] The Enterprise goes around like this for about two minutes.
[time=2329] Then it starts to tilt as it goes around, and it goes around like this.
[time=2335] Dad, will you take me on the Enterprise?
[time=2337] Okay, Adam.
[time=2338] Last ride of the day, I'll take you on there.
[time=2341] I took him on there.
[time=2342] I got off.
[time=2343] I couldn't see straight, but I could walk.
[time=2347] Two days later, Dad will you take me on the Enterprise?
[time=2350] I spent the rest of that day with my head between my knees.
[time=2355] Two days later, I took him on the Enterprise.
[time=2357] I was violently ill.
[time=2360] Two days later, we got to the amusement park.
[time=2363] I heard the sound of the rides and the popcorn said, "I got sick."
[time=2370] We are going to Florida in two months.
[time=2373] I said, "Adam, come here." I took out my tape measure.
[time=2379] He's 45 and a half inches tall.
[time=2383] He will never make 48 inches by April 1st.
[time=2389] I want my son to grow.
[time=2395] Do you know there's a father in heaven who looks down and he says, "I want you to grow."
[time=2401] "I want you to be able to handle life." "I want you to be strong." "I want you to be mature." "I want you to grow." And so I'm going to send you a tough time and it'll make you stronger.
[time=2417] And then when you've handled that, I'll probably send you a tougher time.
[time=2421] But in the midst of all that, he looks down in those tough times and he says,
[time=2427] "You're doing good, son." My daughter, I'm proud of you.
[time=2432] Well done.
[time=2434] Now good and faithful servant and praise motivates us through the tough times.
[time=2442] Here's a second principle that will help us get through the tough times.
[time=2446] It's found in verses 5 through 10.
[time=2449] May I read those for you.
[time=2451] All of this is evidence that God's judgment is right.
[time=2455] And as a result, you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you are suffering.
[time=2461] God is just.
[time=2463] He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled and to us as well.
[time=2471] This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.
[time=2479] He will punish those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[time=2486] They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people.
[time=2499] And to be marveled at among all those who have believed, this includes you because you believed our testimony to you.
[time=2509] Here's the second principle that will help each of us make it through the tough times.
[time=2513] Remember the promises of God.
[time=2523] And there are four statements that he makes about this.
[time=2527] Statement number one is God is just.
[time=2532] He says it again and again in verse five and verse six.
[time=2536] God is just.
[time=2539] The human heart wants to say God life isn't fair.
[time=2543] Look at that person.
[time=2545] They love you.
[time=2546] They've served you and their son has got leukemia.
[time=2550] Look at this individual.
[time=2551] They have served you all of their life and they've lost their job.
[time=2555] Look at that individual.
[time=2557] She is a godly woman and her husband has abandoned her.
[time=2563] God, look at that guy.
[time=2567] He's a creep.
[time=2569] Everybody knows that he cheats on his wife and that he is unfaithful to her.
[time=2574] Everybody knows that in his business dealings he's dishonest.
[time=2578] And God, I read in the paper where he got a promotion.
[time=2582] And now he is the senior chief executive officer.
[time=2586] And life just gets better and better for him.
[time=2591] It isn't fair.
[time=2593] It isn't just.
[time=2596] I don't know about you.
[time=2598] Nothing impurities me more than when an obviously guilty criminal gets off by a technicality in the law.
[time=2607] One Hollywood script had this excellent line.
[time=2610] Someone has kidnapped justice and hid it in the law.
[time=2617] There's something about each of us that becomes angry when life is not fair.
[time=2623] Psalm 37 speaks of that theme.
[time=2626] It says this from the mouth of David.
[time=2629] Do not fret yourself because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong.
[time=2636] Human nature is to say, why?
[time=2639] That guy shaves corners when he built the house and made all kinds of money.
[time=2644] And I've been very conscientious and I lost some profits because of it.
[time=2650] It isn't fair.
[time=2653] How to do it the way the evil doers do it.
[time=2655] I'd come out dollars ahead.
[time=2657] Psalm 73 picks up the theme very graphically.
[time=2660] Listen to verses three through eight.
[time=2664] For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
[time=2668] They have no struggles.
[time=2671] Their bodies are healthy and strong.
[time=2674] They are free from the burdens common to man.
[time=2677] And by human ills, therefore pride is their necklace.
[time=2681] They clothe themselves with violence.
[time=2683] From their callous hearts comes iniquity.
[time=2686] The evil conceits of their minds no, no limits.
[time=2689] They scoff and speak with malice.
[time=2692] In their arrogance they threaten oppression.
[time=2696] Their mouths lay claim to heaven and their tongues take possession of the earth.
[time=2701] Isn't fair.
[time=2704] This person has been evil and accumulated wealth.
[time=2708] And they're not worried about how they can get another year out of the old jalopy they're driving.
[time=2713] They have made a fortune through cheating other people and their house is a palace.
[time=2721] They don't sit around and worry about whether they can afford to take their kids to the dentist or whether they ought to put it off.
[time=2728] They don't have any of the ills that the rest of us humans struggle with.
[time=2733] The question comes back, is God just?
[time=2738] Is life really fair?
[time=2741] And we ask two questions.
[time=2743] Why me?
[time=2746] Why do I have the hard times?
[time=2749] And why not them?
[time=2753] Remember the promises of God.
[time=2756] Four simple statements.
[time=2758] One, God is just.
[time=2762] He is just.
[time=2764] Statement number two, you will be rewarded.
[time=2767] He said you're suffering right now, but that just proves that you're worthy of the kingdom of God and there's a day when you're going to have rest.
[time=2776] There's going to come a day when God will reward you and he will give you rest.
[time=2784] There'll be a day when you won't have to fight a weak heart anymore.
[time=2792] There'll be a day when you won't have to battle trying to make your money stretch as far as your money.
[time=2799] There'll be a day when you won't have to battle with cancer and car accidents.
[time=2803] There'll be a day when you won't have to deal with recessions and depressions and layoffs and cutbacks.
[time=2810] There'll be a day when God will reward you.
[time=2814] He'll give you rest.
[time=2816] Secondly, there'll be a day, or thirdly I should say, there'll be a day when he punishes the rest.
[time=2821] He describes them as those who trouble you, those who do not know God, and those who do not obey the gospel.
[time=2828] By saying those who do not know God, he's not referring to that person who has not yet heard about Jesus.
[time=2834] He's referring to that person who has heard about Christ but rejects him and he doesn't personally know God.
[time=2842] And he says that he is going to punish them in two ways.
[time=2846] He's going to punish them with everlasting destruction and he's going to punish them by shutting them out of the presence of his glory.
[time=2856] One of the things that we often don't like to talk about or to teach is the harsh reality of hell.
[time=2864] It confronts us squarely in this passage that there is a heaven to be gained and a hell to be shunned.
[time=2873] We don't like to talk about hell, but we need to face the reality that God has a place reserved for those who don't receive Christ.
[time=2882] Jonathan Edwards in the late 1700s spoke about hell. In a message he called sinners in the hands of an angry God.
[time=2892] He talked about God holding a soul over hell like a young boy dangling a spider over the flames of a fireplace.
[time=2901] By the time Jonathan Edwards got done, it was said in that church you could feel the heat of hell and sense the smell of smoke.
[time=2910] It's real.
[time=2912] The Bible says that God will punish with an everlasting destruction.
[time=2917] I believe that there are degrees in hell.
[time=2920] Dante in his classic work The Divine Comedy wrote three sections the first is called The Inferno
[time=2927] where he described nine different levels of hell.
[time=2931] It's called The Divine Comedy because he said he took a journey through the nine levels of hell and then he said
[time=2938] and I saw you in level one and you were in level three and he named the names of his contemporaries, hence they called it The Comedy.
[time=2945] I don't think Dante is right that there are nine levels of hell, but I do believe that there are good degrees of suffering.
[time=2952] Why do I believe that? Because Jesus said it will be worse for this one than it will be for that one.
[time=2958] It would be better for the people of Tyre and Sidon than for you, Beth Seydon in the day of judgment.
[time=2965] There are going to be degrees of hell.
[time=2968] And I believe that those who have the opportunity to receive Christ and reject him will be punished more severely than those who have not heard of Christ and are only being punished because of a life of sin.
[time=2983] Now please don't imagine that hell was anything less than hell.
[time=2988] By saying there are degrees of hell I don't mean to say some people are going to suffer a hot day in Miami without air conditioning.
[time=2994] Hell will be hell.
[time=2996] But there is a second punishment God says.
[time=3001] That is they will be shut out from the majesty of his glory.
[time=3006] Perhaps one of the worst parts about eternal punishment is to stand before God, to see him in all of his glory, only there for a moment to be judged by him and then to see the doors shut and to never ever be able to go back.
[time=3023] Three or four years ago Cathy and I had the privilege of going on the missions trip.
[time=3031] We went from Tokyo to Hong Kong to the ghettos of Manila and after three weeks we had a two day layover in Hawaii.
[time=3042] The difference between the ghettos of Manila and of Hawaii were night and day.
[time=3049] We were there two days and when we flew back we said this place is so wonderful.
[time=3054] We may have been better off to never see it because for the rest of our lives we're going to say I want to go back.
[time=3060] If we feel that way about a little point on the globe can you imagine what it's going to be like for the thousands who stand before God and see him in his glory and his majesty and all that he is and that heaven will be and then he shuts the door after that judgment.
[time=3078] And they'll never go back.
[time=3081] Fourth statement he makes is this one.
[time=3084] None of this will happen until Jesus comes.
[time=3090] You won't receive your rest, they won't receive their punishment until the day when Jesus comes.
[time=3097] That means we have to remember the promises of God for a lifetime.
[time=3102] If you're hanging on there because you think this week God's going to make life fair you're probably going to be disappointed.
[time=3111] If you're hanging on because you think well after this year then I'll be treated equitably.
[time=3117] You're going to be disappointed.
[time=3119] God will not balance the scales until eternity.
[time=3124] A story is told about two farmers, one godly the other a reprobate. The reprobate constantly teased and mocked the godly man.
[time=3134] When harvest came the ungodly farmer had a much bigger crop than the godly one and he ridiculed the farmer and teased them all the more and said where is your god?
[time=3148] And the godly farmer wisely said God doesn't settle his accounts in October.
[time=3156] God doesn't settle his accounts in October.
[time=3161] You and I may live with life being out of balance and the scales being tipped against us but hang in there.
[time=3171] He'll balance the scales but it may not be until eternity.
[time=3176] Third and final principle comes from verses 11 and 12.
[time=3181] May I read those for you.
[time=3184] With this in mind we constantly pray for you that our god may count you worthy of his calling
[time=3191] and that by his power he may fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your love.
[time=3198] We pray this so that the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified in you and you and him according to the grace of our god and Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3209] Third principle is this remember to pray.
[time=3215] When you go through the hard times of life you've got to remember the promises of God and you've got to remember to pray.
[time=3223] I'd like to break my thoughts down into two what Paul didn't pray for and what he did pray for.
[time=3230] Conspicuously absent Paul did not pray that their trials would end.
[time=3237] He didn't pray that justice would be served immediately.
[time=3242] Secondly look what he did pray for.
[time=3245] There's a little phrase it's found in verse 12 we pray this so that those two words so that tip us off in what's called in grammar a purpose clause.
[time=3258] Paul said I'm praying and thinking all these things with this goal with this purpose in mind he prays that Christ will be glorified.
[time=3270] We love glory, Emmys, Oscars, Grammys, Dubs, MVP, All-Star, All-American, All-Pro, Pulitzer Prize, Blue Remed, Gold Medal, All-American, Heisman Trophy, First Team, Virtue Also, Prima Ballerina on and on the list of praise grows and we love it.
[time=3296] We want glory but our life is not to accumulate glory for ourselves but our life is to be a conduit that takes glory and points it towards the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3310] In the hard times we should pray not God get me out of this but God glorify yourselves in me.
[time=3320] Paul went through the hard times.
[time=3323] In 2 Corinthians chapter 12 he says that he had a thorn in the flesh.
[time=3328] By that he meant that he had something physically wrong with him and that he prayed three times for God to take it away and all three times God answered was this.
[time=3340] My grace is sufficient for you because my strength is perfected in weakness.
[time=3350] What he meant by that is this Paul if you are physically strong and capable everyone says wow look at Paul isn't he something.
[time=3358] But Paul if I keep you weak and dependent when you excel and succeed people say wow God did it through Paul and God is glorified.
[time=3372] The chief purpose of man is to know God and to glorify him.
[time=3379] Everything that we do as a church ought to be to glorify him.
[time=3383] If we sing a song it ought to be to glorify him.
[time=3386] If we teach it ought to be to glorify him.
[time=3388] If we give money to an offering it ought to be to glorify him and it ought never to be for our own comfort our own glory.
[time=3401] Most of you have been here long enough that you know that my spiritual father is a man by the name of David Burnham.
[time=3409] This morning I had the privilege of just watching a half hour television he was on one of the other stations.
[time=3416] As I was watching I was reminded of my history that a man wanted to go to South America as a missionary and he did.
[time=3423] He had to come home his health would not allow him to stay. He became a professor and then president of Wheaton College and there he motivated a whole generation of young men to go to the mission field.
[time=3434] Many of them went to South America.
[time=3436] Four of those men went to the Aka Indians.
[time=3440] A chapel of people prayed as they went out.
[time=3443] A chapel continued to pray when they were told they landed but we've not heard from them on the radio.
[time=3449] A chapel of students at Wheaton College heard the announcements.
[time=3453] We have found the plane and there are four bodies.
[time=3458] They were killed.
[time=3460] When that announcement went out we have found the bodies.
[time=3464] There was in that auditorium a young man by the name of David Burnham who said God they gave their lives to glorify you.
[time=3474] Be glorified in my life.
[time=3478] Twenty years later that story was told in a church called the Shackle University Park as I heard.
[time=3487] Our broadcast today included music from our sanctuary choir The Men's Singers and soloist Marilyn Wall.
[time=3493] The message was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3496] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3503] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending Jesus the savior of the world.
[time=3510] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3514] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3520] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3524] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3529] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
