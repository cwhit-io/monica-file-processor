[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (bell ringing) Often we find ourselves in life, against all odds.
[time=57] That's how George Washington found himself.
[time=60] As he looked at the British Army, and then the ragtag volunteers that came to form the American militia, he noticed that they were missing guns, gunpowder, training, and boots.
[time=73] So overwhelming were the odds that he said to Patrick Henry, quote, "From the day I enter
[time=79] upon the command of the American armies, I date my fall and the ruin of my reputation.
[time=87] Perhaps today you feel like you're a man, a woman, against all odds." Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox.
[time=106] Thank you for joining us.
[time=108] Rick's message today is entitled, "Against All Odds." Perhaps that describes your situation, or that of a friend.
[time=115] No matter what you are facing, we have an equalizer in God's Holy Spirit, and we have the encouragement of God's Word.
[time=122] As we study 2 Thessalonians 2, we will discover three principles that strengthen and comfort
[time=128] when we are against all odds.
[time=131] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us.
[time=134] Rick's text today is taken from the book of 2 Thessalonians 2 verses 1 through 17.
[time=143] Our special music today will be provided by Brian Losen.
[time=148] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir and soloist Keith Brodigam bring us a song entitled, "The Next Time He Comes."
[time=173] [MUSIC - 192 seconds]
[time=372] (applause)
[time=378] Thank you, Keith.
[time=380] What a glorious prospect to know that the Lord is coming again, and we'll meet Him if we're here.
[time=386] We'll look forward to Him coming through the clouds.
[time=388] This is a song.
[time=389] If you know that He's coming again for you, you could say, "I am thine, O Lord." Him number 358.
[time=395] We'll sing the first, second, and fourth stanzas together.
[time=404] (applause) [MUSIC - 127 seconds]
[time=539] - Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=541] I do appreciate our congregation as they sing so enthusiastically and the choir as they lead us in music.
[time=548] And our soloists, we do appreciate all of our musicians in our church.
[time=552] Today, Brian Losin is going to sing two numbers for us.
[time=555] In a moment, he'll be coming to sing the first one, but I want to introduce you to a record made by Brian this fall entitled "Closer Than a Heartbeat." He worked on this all through the fall and then in Christmas, about Christmas time, he gave me this album to look through and listen to.
[time=570] And I highly recommend it.
[time=572] It's in the foyer available after our service in cassette and record form.
[time=576] And do avail yourselves of some marvelous Christian music from our own Brian Losin.
[time=581] He's going to come right now and sing a song that's the title song of his record, "A Very Beautiful Peace," speaking of the Lord being closer than a heartbeat away from us as we have needs.
[time=590] "Closer Than a Heartbeat" by Brian Losin.
[time=593] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=798] This is a Sunday morning at Blackhawk, the beginning of a new week,
[time=806] and we're thankful that you've decided to come along with us for this hour of worship and praise.
[time=812] We certainly hope God uses our time together to strengthen your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=817] We've broken away from our morning worship service to tell you about some coming events in the life of our church and community.
[time=824] Good morning, Pete.
[time=825] Good morning, Rick.
[time=826] We've really been fortunate with our weather during the January month with pretty good weather for people to come and worship with us.
[time=833] Well, we certainly have.
[time=834] I was outside jogging yesterday and there's no excuse that people couldn't at least walk the church today.
[time=839] And as you mentioned, there are other events coming up in the life of our church, one of which is a choral clinic on February 9th.
[time=846] That's a Friday evening right here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=850] The Anker Room bookstore along with Wade Holbrook is hosting a choral clinic for those of you that would like to improve your singing ability.
[time=858] Chris and Carol Beatty will be here and they'll give a three-hour session that evening from 7 o'clock until 10 p.m.
[time=865] I hope that you can set that time aside and if you would like more information about it, you can call the Anker Room and ask for Wade Holbrook at the number is area code 219-485-0812.
[time=880] And then carrying on over into the Saturday, February 10th, we'll be having a choral contest here with soloists singing throughout the day and being adjudicated.
[time=891] And then that evening at 7 p.m. Raybolts, a very fine singer, will be hosting a concert that evening at the Blackhawk Baptist Church Worship Center at 7 p.m.
[time=902] Along with Raybolts will be Priscilla Ingle and winners of the contest will be singing that night.
[time=908] Well, that's going to be two full days and we're looking forward to those events and all of them are taking place right here at Blackhawk.
[time=916] So if you would like to be a part of the clinic, the contest or the concert, just plan on being here at Blackhawk.
[time=923] On that same day, Saturday, February the 10th is another great opportunity here in our community.
[time=929] Author Charles Colson will be here to speak.
[time=933] Many of you will remember Charles Colson was special counsel to President Nixon.
[time=938] He ended up going to prison for his role in the Watergate cover-up.
[time=942] In prison, he gave his heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=945] Over the years, he has authored some of the best-selling and most insightful books that a Christian could read.
[time=951] They include Born Again, Against the Darkness and Loving God.
[time=956] Colson will be here in Fort Wayne for an 11 o'clock speaking engagement on Saturday, February the 10th.
[time=965] If you would like information on how you can purchase tickets, which are only $2, you can call us here Monday through Friday at Blackhawk Ministries, and we'll be glad to help you get tickets.
[time=976] Simply call us here at 4937400.
[time=982] That's 493 7400.
[time=986] Then on the next day, February the 11th, we are having an open house, a friend day, here at Blackhawk.
[time=993] We want to ask you friends who join us by way of television to come and join us in person.
[time=999] See the building, see the choir, meet the people who are behind the scenes of the Bible hour.
[time=1005] I know some of you are homebound and can't come.
[time=1008] I also know that hundreds, if not thousands of you, simply need to take the initiative to get out and to come to church in person.
[time=1016] We've set this day aside as a friend day to open up our doors and our hearts to you.
[time=1021] And we'll have a special musical guest as a part of that morning.
[time=1024] Yes, Rick. Chris Beatty is a fine choral clinician and coach, and he's coached many of the famous singers that we hear on the radio, Steve Green, Twyla Paris, White Heart, and a number of other individuals.
[time=1038] And he is going to be with us that Sunday morning, and we'll sing in our morning worship services.
[time=1044] Well, our two morning worship services are identical. The first is at 9.15. The second is at 10.50.
[time=1051] You simply choose the one that works the best for you and then come and join us February the 11th for our open house, friend day.
[time=1059] Finally, before we rejoin our church service, we want to share a booklet with you entitled What a Marvelous Salvation.
[time=1067] This book has been put together by Jim Pearson of our pastoral staff. And in five lessons and Bible study, you'll have a grip on what the Bible says about Jesus Christ, his death for our sins, how you can know for sure you have a home in heaven.
[time=1083] You'll walk away with a sense of assurance and a deep sense of gratitude to God for what he's done.
[time=1089] It's a gift from us to you. If you'll simply write an export, we'll mail you a copy this week.
[time=1095] You can receive a copy of this helpful booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1107] Once again, write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1116] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today here for the Bible Hour.
[time=1125] Touch through me, Holy Spirit, touch through me.
[time=1141] Let my hands reach out to others, touch through me.
[time=1154] There's a lonely soul somewhere,
[time=1160] needing just one friend to care.
[time=1166] Touch through me, Holy Spirit, touch through me.
[time=1193] I will be my brother's keeper, love through me.
[time=1207] Hearts are bleeding deep inside, love can dry the weeping eyes.
[time=1220] Love through me, Holy Spirit, love through me.
[time=1249] I could river in the desert, love through me.
[time=1263] Springing content, healing stream, living water pure and clean.
[time=1277] Love through me, Holy Spirit, love through me.
[time=1291] My hands will be your hands, reaching out to others.
[time=1306] Your hands will not least not hold for just me.
[time=1320] I will be that good Samaritan, to someone else in need.
[time=1337] I will be your house to dwell in, live through me.
[time=1350] Love through me, Holy Spirit, love through me, Holy Spirit, touch through me, Holy Spirit, touch through me.
[time=1380] Our Father this morning, Brian his son, the prayer of our hearts, that you would fill us, use us.
[time=1397] You would touch this world through me.
[time=1401] Oh Father today, we want to be your people.
[time=1405] We want to be the wrench in your hand.
[time=1408] We want to be the scalpel in your fingertips.
[time=1411] We want to be the voice of your tongue.
[time=1414] We want to be the hands of your arms.
[time=1417] We want to be your ambassadors today.
[time=1420] And so we ask you now to clean us and wash us, forgive us and renew us.
[time=1427] We admit to you that you are God and we worship your holiness.
[time=1434] We confess to you that we are but the sheep of your pasture.
[time=1439] And sticking to the wool of our life or the briars of sin and the barbs of unrighteousness.
[time=1447] We ask you to take us into washes, to make us wide as wool, to make our lives as clean as the earth on the morning of a new snow.
[time=1459] We ask you to refresh us like the spring rains and the budding of April's flowers.
[time=1466] We ask you to make our lives bright and radiant like the sun that glistens on a summer day.
[time=1475] Oh God, only you can renew the inner being.
[time=1480] And so today we ask you to make us new and then to use us to touch this world.
[time=1487] You've said that we are to be light, to give direction, to be salt, to preserve a society.
[time=1496] And as Brian is son, we ask you to do that through our lives.
[time=1500] Give us an unusual impact in these days.
[time=1506] Help us to be light to a world that's lost in darkness of sensuality, sexual pleasure and abortion.
[time=1514] Help us today to be salt, that we can have a preserving power.
[time=1518] We pray today for our general assembly as they meet to consider laws that there would be laws that recognize that life is precious.
[time=1527] That you would make in our society a hunger for righteousness.
[time=1531] And may it begin with this body of people.
[time=1535] Help us today to walk in obedience.
[time=1538] Give men strength to say no to cocaine. Help women to resist the urge of marijuana.
[time=1545] Help those who have found sex to be their recreation.
[time=1549] To have righteousness, replace it as their goal.
[time=1552] Help us to use our bodies as your temple.
[time=1556] Give us that urgency in life.
[time=1559] And as we live in a society that is against you, is against your word. Help us today to face life against all odds.
[time=1568] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1573] There have been those who in history have lived against all odds.
[time=1581] Jim Bowie, Davie Crockett, gave their lives at the Alamo against all odds.
[time=1592] To this day, their echoes through the voices of Americans.
[time=1595] That one statement, remember the Alamo, a time when Americans stood against all odds.
[time=1603] In the early days of our history, George Washington was asked to take on the British Empire,
[time=1610] the most sophisticated Navy and the most advanced Army on the globe of the Earth.
[time=1615] He was given 17,000 ragtag men.
[time=1619] Most of them didn't have guns or gunpowder, training our shoes.
[time=1626] 5,000 of them died from disease while living in camp before the first bullet was ever shot.
[time=1636] There was question as to whether that army of predominantly new Englanders would even follow the leadership of a Southern General.
[time=1645] He was so discouraged that he said these words to his close friend and fellow Virginian, Patrick Henry.
[time=1652] From the day I enter upon the command of the American forces, I date my fall in the ruin of my reputation.
[time=1661] He was a man who went up against all odds.
[time=1666] There was a church, a couple thousand years ago by the name of the church of Thessaloniki.
[time=1673] They lived in a society that was totally against them, that persecuted them, that alienated them, and ultimately martyred them.
[time=1683] These people were challenged by Paul to live against all odds.
[time=1689] Some of you today feel like the cards have been stacked against you.
[time=1695] And what's being dealt to you is a hand that you can't beat.
[time=1699] You're facing all odds.
[time=1702] I'd like to encourage you to know that in Jesus Christ we have an equalizer.
[time=1708] If you have a Bible, please open it to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[time=1713] In 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 we are studying about the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[time=1720] In this study he will talk about the promise of a rapture.
[time=1726] He will talk about a great tribulation, a time when God's anger is poured out on earth.
[time=1734] To some of you that will seem like archaic history.
[time=1738] It will seem like the wishful thinking of troubled souls of antiquity.
[time=1744] But I want you to know that it is as current as today's best-selling books published just this month.
[time=1752] Nesbets Megatrends for the year 2000 promises to be a block-busting best-seller.
[time=1760] In it he talks about millennialism.
[time=1764] The hope of the globe that there's coming a new age.
[time=1768] He even references evangelical Christianity's hope for the return of Christ.
[time=1772] He moves into the new age in their anticipation that aliens are going to bring us hope and life.
[time=1778] And then he moves into the world of science and technology with its hope that in the year 2000 maybe we can reverse the greenhouse effect.
[time=1788] Maybe by the year 2000 we can control AIDS.
[time=1792] Maybe by the year 2000 we will have a cure for cancer.
[time=1796] Perhaps by the year 2000 we will be able to reach a measure of peace that the globe has never known.
[time=1804] It's not really history is it?
[time=1808] It's more a study of futures.
[time=1810] And it's not just amongst those who are biblical-minded like the pastor of a church, but among secular forecasters.
[time=1818] The interest in the end of a millennium and the beginning of a new.
[time=1824] How do you face changing times against all odds?
[time=1830] Allow me to read for you the first two verses to set the stage.
[time=1834] 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 1 and 2.
[time=1838] Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him.
[time=1844] We ask you brothers not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy.
[time=1852] Report our letter supposed to have come from us saying that the day of the Lord has already come.
[time=1862] This church was in a crisis over the soon return of Christ.
[time=1868] The cause of their crisis was twofold.
[time=1873] First of all they were going through the tough times.
[time=1877] They had seen Paul's beaten body.
[time=1880] They saw the marks that stones had left.
[time=1883] They saw the permanent abrasions on his wrist from Roman shackles.
[time=1888] They had seen the scars on his face where he had been beaten.
[time=1893] They themselves had been pushed aside in their economic community.
[time=1898] This one had been considered dead by their family because they came to Christ.
[time=1902] That one had been abandoned by their spouse because she had come to Christ.
[time=1907] These had been arrested and some had been beaten and some had been martyred.
[time=1913] They were facing tough times.
[time=1917] It was coming from their family and friends.
[time=1919] It was coming from their community.
[time=1921] It was coming from their government.
[time=1923] The odds were stacked against them and they felt like this has got to be the great tribulation.
[time=1930] Life could not be any worse than this.
[time=1934] Joel, Zephaniah, Zachariah had all predicted hundreds of years ago about the day of the Lord.
[time=1942] Tribulation and judgment came or would come.
[time=1946] Paul had told them with his own voice when he had been with them that it was coming based
[time=1952] upon the way they were suffering.
[time=1954] They thought this is it.
[time=1956] The second cause for the crisis was a rumor that had been spread around.
[time=1963] That Paul himself had said this is the great tribulation.
[time=1969] Verse 2, he said, "Don't be alarmed.
[time=1972] Don't be alarmed or unsettled about these events as though you've already missed out.
[time=1979] Don't think that Christ came to the church and he gathered them up and you got left behind.
[time=1987] Don't be scared that you're already in the tribulation.
[time=1992] But a rumor had been going about.
[time=1995] The rumor had come from three sources. It had come from prophecy.
[time=1999] Apart from the apostles themselves, there were people who God uniquely gifted in Biblical times
[time=2005] with prophetic utterances.
[time=2008] Agabus was one of those.
[time=2010] So were his daughters.
[time=2013] Barnabas seemed to have a prophetic gift from time to time.
[time=2017] Timothy had it.
[time=2020] But there were also people who thought they had it and didn't.
[time=2024] Or those who had it but weren't always accurate.
[time=2028] Apparently what happened is somebody stood up in the church of Thessalonica and said, "I have a prophecy from the Lord." He said, "The great tribulation, the day of the Lord is going to start on January the 28th 1990 at 1130."
[time=2046] This is it. We're in the great tribulation.
[time=2050] And they probably gave that proclamation with some type of visible supernatural circumstances.
[time=2060] Maybe they spoke in tongue.
[time=2062] Maybe they fell over, slain in the Spirit.
[time=2065] Maybe they started with a protracted opening.
[time=2068] This is the message from the Lord.
[time=2071] However I got there, it was wrong.
[time=2074] Can I just give you a little side application today?
[time=2077] Just because somebody says, "I've got a message from the Lord." Doesn't mean it's from the Lord.
[time=2082] Just because somebody speaks in tongue doesn't mean God has anything to do with it.
[time=2085] Just because somebody knocks somebody over and they say they're slain and the Spirit doesn't mean God had his hand in it.
[time=2095] But somebody stood up and said, "This is the great tribulation." Another source it came from was they thought that that had come from a report that was traced back to Paul.
[time=2108] Somebody told somebody who heard it from somebody who thought that Paul said it
[time=2114] a few months ago.
[time=2116] That's getting it straight.
[time=2119] Happens here at Blackhawk all the time.
[time=2121] Someone will call and say, "Fred is really down." I think Fred may take his life, do something quick.
[time=2129] What did Fred tell you?
[time=2132] I haven't seen Fred in months.
[time=2135] How do you know Fred's about to take his life?
[time=2137] Well, Fred's friend called me.
[time=2139] Who's Fred's friend?
[time=2141] I don't know.
[time=2142] I forget his name.
[time=2143] Just the same we call Fred and we say, "Hi, Fred.
[time=2147] This is Rick.
[time=2148] How are you doing?
[time=2149] Oh, great.
[time=2150] You wouldn't believe how things have gone this year.
[time=2152] Best year of my life.
[time=2153] Why do you ask?
[time=2154] Oh, just curious.
[time=2159] What had happened is they'd gotten a report and they didn't get it very close to the source.
[time=2163] And so Paul said, "There's coming a great and terrible day of the Lord.
[time=2166] Get ready." Someone else said, "Paul said the great and terrible day of the Lord is about to get ready." Somebody passed out on and said, "Paul said this is the great and terrible day of the Lord.
[time=2176] Get ready." Somebody else said, "This is the great and terrible day of the Lord.
[time=2178] Sorry you weren't ready." He just went around by a report and it wasn't accurate.
[time=2187] Third source they had was from a letter.
[time=2190] Let me give you a big word.
[time=2191] Pseudo-pig graphical has nothing to do with pigs.
[time=2195] Pseudo means false.
[time=2197] Grafé means to write.
[time=2200] Pseudo-pig graphical letters when you write something and at the end of it sign the wrong
[time=2206] name.
[time=2207] Let me give you an illustration.
[time=2210] This guy in junior high school just loved this girl and we knew it.
[time=2215] And we'd always tease him, "Hey, here comes Susie." He'd see Susie coming.
[time=2219] I mean he'd hide.
[time=2220] You know, run into the restroom, bend down like he's tying his shoe until he went by, jump in his locker and lock it.
[time=2225] You know, anything to avoid contact with Susie.
[time=2228] So one of the dirty things we did is we took and we wrote a letter.
[time=2232] "Dear Susie, I really like you.
[time=2236] Do you like me?" We put his name at the bottom of it and left the appropriate three boxes.
[time=2244] Yes?
[time=2245] No?
[time=2246] Maybe.
[time=2247] And we stuck it in Susie's locker with his name on it.
[time=2253] And when he got the letter back in his locker with a maybe, he died.
[time=2259] I didn't write that letter.
[time=2260] I never liked her.
[time=2261] I think she's a, you know, junior high guys are.
[time=2264] But he was done in by a letter that had the wrong name at the bottom.
[time=2271] That's what had happened to this church.
[time=2273] Somebody sent a letter, said, "This is the great tribulation.
[time=2278] The world is coming to an end.
[time=2280] Jesus raptured out all the true believers and only the half-wits are left behind and signed it.
[time=2288] Paul." And all these people in Thessalonica, "Oh my goodness.
[time=2292] The apostle Paul has sent it and it's right here in writing." This church was in a panic.
[time=2299] Life was rough and now they had a rumor that they were already in the end times.
[time=2305] So Paul has to correct the crises and that's what verses 3 through 12 are about.
[time=2311] Let me read those for you.
[time=2314] Verse 3.
[time=2315] "Don't let anyone deceive you in any way.
[time=2317] For that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed,
[time=2324] the man doomed for destruction.
[time=2328] He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped
[time=2335] so that he sets himself up in God's temple proclaiming himself to be God."
[time=2342] Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things and now you
[time=2350] know what is holding him back so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
[time=2356] For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work but the one who now holds it back will
[time=2362] continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
[time=2366] And then the lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will overpower with the breath
[time=2373] of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
[time=2378] Coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracle signs and wonders and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing they perish because they refuse to love the truth and to be saved.
[time=2396] For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so they will believe the lie and so
[time=2404] that they will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
[time=2412] In this passage Paul gives four statements to correct their wrong view about the return
[time=2419] of Christ.
[time=2420] First thing that he says is the rebellion must occur.
[time=2425] He is more or less giving them some sequential of events and he says wait a minute you are
[time=2431] thinking this is the tribulation remember when I was with you I explained all this.
[time=2437] First the rebellion must occur.
[time=2442] Now there has always been and there will always be rebellions.
[time=2446] There will always be Sandenistas and there will always be Contras.
[time=2450] There will always be Billy Grahams and there will always be Hugh Hefner's.
[time=2455] There is going to be that.
[time=2458] But there is coming a time Paul said to them previously in here when the rebellion is going to happen.
[time=2465] There is going to come a time when people in mass rebel against God.
[time=2472] But the word for rebellion here if you took all the Greek letters like Alpha and Pi and
[time=2478] you switched them to A and the P you would come out with our English word apostasy.
[time=2485] What apostasy is is the rebellion of those who go to church.
[time=2492] To those that have Bibles.
[time=2494] To those who have memorized verses of scripture.
[time=2497] To those who have held positions of leadership in churches.
[time=2502] To those people who have known about God.
[time=2505] And who have believed in God.
[time=2508] And who have taught about God.
[time=2510] But have never personally finally gave their heart to God.
[time=2515] The rebellion is when all of those religious people turn their back and fall away from God.
[time=2523] That is the rebellion the apostasy when people fall away and turn their back on true faith in God.
[time=2532] Paul's point is this.
[time=2534] This is not the great tribulation because the rebellion has not yet occurred.
[time=2540] Second statement he says is the revelation of the lawless man must occur.
[time=2546] I don't know whether you grew up watching the cowboy shows.
[time=2551] But when I was a little boy, I mean we had Nancy Derringer, Roy Rogers, Hop Along Cassidy,
[time=2557] the Cisco kid and one of them was the lawman.
[time=2563] Half hour show, the lawman didn't say very much but you didn't mess around in his town.
[time=2572] He had a mustache, a badge and a six shooter and he always kept the law.
[time=2580] There is coming a man who is exactly the opposite.
[time=2584] The Bible calls him the man of lawlessness.
[time=2590] Another name for him elsewhere is the anti-Christ.
[time=2596] The word anti has two meanings.
[time=2598] It means that which is opposed to, that which is opposite of and the anti-Christ will be opposed to Christ in the opposite of Christ.
[time=2607] But the word anti also means a substitute and that's how the anti-Christ will begin his program.
[time=2616] He will begin by being a substitute for Christ.
[time=2619] He will begin by challenging people to think that he is actually Christ, a false Christ, a pseudo-Messiah.
[time=2632] It won't be till later that he turns his hand and you see the lawless side of him.
[time=2638] But Paul's point is this, this isn't the tribulation because the rebellion has not occurred
[time=2645] and the anti-Christ has not been revealed.
[time=2649] But there's also an aside point we need to cover.
[time=2653] He said even though the anti-Christ has not yet appeared, the spirit and the force and the power of anti-Christ is already at work.
[time=2665] Verse 7, "For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work.
[time=2672] Both they and we live against all odds.
[time=2677] It's not just man against man flesh against flesh.
[time=2681] We are in a spiritual battle against forces of evil in our world."
[time=2689] Martin Luther was so accurate when he penned the second words or the second stanza of a mighty fortress is our God.
[time=2697] He said, "If we, in our own strength, confide our striving would be losing.
[time=2704] If not the right man, we're on our side, a man of God's own choosing.
[time=2709] Let's ask who that may be Christ Jesus.
[time=2712] It is he, Lord, savvy off his name from age to age the same and he shall win the battle.
[time=2719] I loved it when Keith and the choir sang.
[time=2721] The next time he comes, he's not going to die on the cross.
[time=2726] The next time he comes, there's not going to be a Calvary.
[time=2731] The next time he comes, he is coming for me with power and glory and he will literally blow the anti-Christ over with the breath out of his nostrils.
[time=2745] But until that day, we fight against all odds.
[time=2751] But Paul's point is this, you're not in the tribulation.
[time=2755] You didn't miss the rapture because the rebellion hasn't occurred.
[time=2759] The anti-Christ hasn't been revealed.
[time=2761] And then third statement he makes is the restrainer has not yet been removed.
[time=2766] And verses six and seven, it reads almost cryptically.
[time=2770] He says, "You know what's holding it back so that the anti-Christ will be revealed at the proper time.
[time=2776] And not until he has taken away will the anti-Christ be released." And now the problem is this.
[time=2784] When Paul was with them in oral teaching, he had explained to them what the restrainer was.
[time=2791] And he says, "You know what I'm talking about.
[time=2794] They did.
[time=2795] We don't.
[time=2796] We don't know who the restrainer is based upon this passage.
[time=2802] But I think that we can deduce who the restrainer is." The Bible tells us that the restrainer, the one holding back, is able to keep Satan in check,
[time=2818] to keep all the forces of evil in check, and to set offense about the anti-Christ to keep him in control.
[time=2826] No one can do that but God.
[time=2829] God must be the restrainer.
[time=2833] And God, I believe, does that through the person of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2839] It is God in the person of the Holy Spirit working in this world that keeps Satan from having a free hand.
[time=2847] And how is God present in this world?
[time=2851] He's present by indwelling the life of a believer.
[time=2856] The Holy Spirit is in you, and you, and you, and each of us who know Christ.
[time=2863] But when we are taken away by the rapture, the Holy Spirit is with us, and he leaves,
[time=2871] and the Holy Spirit is gone from the world.
[time=2875] And Satan has a free hand.
[time=2878] The anti-Christ is released, and evil has a heyday.
[time=2886] But Paul says you're not in the tribulation because the rebellion has not occurred,
[time=2893] the revelation of the anti-Christ has not occurred, and the removal of the restrainer has not occurred.
[time=2900] The fourth statement he makes is this, "The return of Christ will follow."
[time=2908] In the midst of all this, they were getting discouraged.
[time=2913] They were beginning to see that the odds were against them.
[time=2917] And so in verses 8, 9, 10, and 11, he reminds them that Christ will return.
[time=2930] He tells them these two truths.
[time=2933] One, Christ will ultimately triumph.
[time=2939] In fact, it says that the anti-Christ, compared to Jesus Christ, is a cardboard man.
[time=2948] And that you will see in the end times this great powerful anti-Christ, and when Jesus comes,
[time=2955] Jesus is going to go, "Whew!" and blow him over.
[time=2960] I'm not making that up.
[time=2961] It says Jesus will destroy him by the breath out of his nostrils and by the splendor of his coming.
[time=2968] So whatever you hear about Satan and his power, just remember Jesus ultimately triumphs.
[time=2980] But before he triumphs, the second thing he teaches them is this, the anti-Christ will temporarily triumph.
[time=2988] How is he going to do that?
[time=2991] He's going to do that because Satan will empower him.
[time=2995] It says that he's going to be empowered by Satan with deceptive skills.
[time=3000] He's going to have ability to produce miracles.
[time=3003] Do you want healings? Go to the anti-Christ, he'll heal you.
[time=3006] You want supernatural displays? He'll pull off resurrections.
[time=3013] But please don't think of Satan or the anti-Christ as the embodiment and personification of that
[time=3021] which is vulgar and ugly and obviously evil.
[time=3027] He will disguise himself as second Corinthians as an angel of light.
[time=3034] And he will be given all of the charismatic gifts a person can want.
[time=3039] He'll have the ability to communicate like Ronald Reagan, to speak like John Kennedy,
[time=3045] to negotiate peace treaties like Mikhail Gorbachev to motivate an army like Genghis Khan.
[time=3052] He's going to have it all and he's going to have great power.
[time=3056] And he's going to work on both extremes.
[time=3059] On this extreme, he is going to create religions that are going to make more sense than anything you've ever heard.
[time=3065] And his religions are going to be based upon the Bible.
[time=3070] He's simply going to take enough of the truth to make it sound like Bible, mix it with enough of air that it's going to mislead everybody.
[time=3078] You see, they're already today churches that talk about we believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
[time=3083] Amazing, so do I. But by "Son of God" I mean that he is God.
[time=3088] By "Son of God" they mean that he's God because God's everywhere.
[time=3093] He's in you, he's in you, and he's in you.
[time=3097] And he doesn't. Not unique belief in Christ, but Satan will deceive millions because he will appear to have the truth.
[time=3106] And it's going to be so close to the truth, it's going to be believable.
[time=3109] And then he's going to work at the other extreme.
[time=3112] He's going to work through demons and evil and the occult.
[time=3116] And don't think that just happens in third world countries where they have voodoo or bizarre places like Southern California.
[time=3125] In our community, in high schools, within a stone's throw of this building,
[time=3131] there are students who say, "I am a witch.
[time=3135] I have power from Satan." And the Antichrist is going to work from extreme to extreme.
[time=3145] Now and then.
[time=3150] And this is also going to happen because God is going to allow it.
[time=3155] Right now, we live in a time of grace where God says, "Come all ye that labor and are heavy laid."
[time=3161] Whosoever will may come, but there's going to come a day when God says this book of life is closed and you can't come.
[time=3172] He's done that before.
[time=3175] He said, "No, a Bill Narken, invite everybody to come, no one would come." And when the door of that arc went shut, it didn't matter how loud they screamed or how vigorously they pounded, God said it's shut.
[time=3189] And they died in the flood.
[time=3191] There came a time when God said the feral, repent, and feral, wouldn't repent.
[time=3195] God impressed him with a plague and feral, wouldn't repent.
[time=3198] And God impressed him with a plague and feral hardened his heart and wouldn't repent.
[time=3202] And God said, "That's it, feral, I'm going to harden your heart the rest of the way." The issue is closed.
[time=3208] God will close the books.
[time=3211] And that's why Satan will have such power.
[time=3214] Well, this is meant to be a message of encouragement.
[time=3217] We need to move to that.
[time=3219] In verses 13 through the end of the chapter, he gives him three ways to be comforted and strengthened as they face insurmountable odds.
[time=3231] Let me give them to you very quickly.
[time=3234] The first one is this.
[time=3238] The support your mind.
[time=3241] Support your mind with God's plan.
[time=3245] Look at verses 13 and 14.
[time=3248] But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers, loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God shows you to be saved.
[time=3254] Through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth, he called you to this through our gospel that you might share in the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3266] What he says is this.
[time=3268] God's already done five things for you.
[time=3271] He loved you.
[time=3272] Before you ever loved him, he loved you.
[time=3275] Then he called you.
[time=3276] You didn't say, "Hey God, I need you." Before you said, "Hey God, I need you." God said, "I love you and I called you." Then he saved you.
[time=3285] After he saved you, he began the process of sanctifying you, and fifthly he promises that he'll glorify you.
[time=3292] Now here's Paul's point, when you're down and when you're discouraged and you feel like the odds are against you, remember God's plan.
[time=3302] And he's already loved you and called you and saved you and begun to sanctify you.
[time=3308] Trust him.
[time=3309] He'll finish what he started.
[time=3312] Trust him.
[time=3313] He'll bring about your salvation and glorification in heaven.
[time=3317] The second thing he says is this, verse 15.
[time=3322] Strengthen your will with God's word.
[time=3329] Verse 15.
[time=3331] So then brothers, stand firm and hold on to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word or mouth or letter.
[time=3340] He says this.
[time=3343] Your will power will be strengthened if you'll get into the word.
[time=3349] So stand and hold on to my word.
[time=3354] Warren Wearsby said that he noticed this at a museum.
[time=3358] That there was a display of precious jewels and people came and people went.
[time=3366] The crowd flowed in and the crowd flowed out, but the guards never moved.
[time=3375] There are going to be people that are going to float in and out of these doors.
[time=3378] People are going to call church, home and black alcohol, but if you're a believer in Christ, you'll not move.
[time=3384] You'll stand in the word.
[time=3387] You won't be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine.
[time=3391] If you're going to face insurmountable odds, then you've got to stand on the word.
[time=3395] The third source of comfort is this one.
[time=3399] Sustain your emotions by prayer.
[time=3403] Verses 16 and 17 are prayer.
[time=3407] In it he prays that God would encourage them and strengthen their faith when the going gets tough, when the odds are against you.
[time=3418] When your emotions are playing games with you, when your will is weak and your mind is doubting, support your mind with God's plan.
[time=3429] Strengthen your will with God's word and sustain your emotions through prayer.
[time=3435] And remember this, when the odds are against you and it seems there's no one to help.
[time=3442] In Jesus Christ, you have an equalizer.
[time=3460] We've been sharing with you today the musical ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and soloist Brian Lowson.
[time=3469] The message was from our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3472] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3481] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that you sent your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3488] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3492] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3497] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3501] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3506] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
