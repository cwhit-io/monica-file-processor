[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] A man and his two married sons were returning home from a trip together.
[time=77] The youngest son said that he was certain that his wife would be waiting for him to return.
[time=83] The older brother chimed in that he was confident that his wife would not only be waiting but that she would be watching for his return.
[time=92] The father smiled and said, "Sons, your mother will be working until I return."
[time=100] What will you be found doing when Christ returns?
[time=108] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=120] Thank you for joining us.
[time=122] Rick's message today is entitled, "Waiting, Watching, Working." What will you be doing when Jesus comes back?
[time=130] Some will be waiting, others watching, a few working, but most will be wondering.
[time=135] Jesus will return like a thief in the night.
[time=138] He will take believers to heaven and the majority who will be left behind will wonder what happened.
[time=144] In today's lesson, we'll study our two highest responsibilities to carry out until Jesus comes.
[time=150] Open your Bible to 2 Thessalonians 3 and your heart to God's Spirit and study with us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=159] We encourage you to study along with us as Rick shares with us what the Lord has laid on his heart.
[time=164] Our text is taken from the book of 2 Thessalonians 3.
[time=169] Our special music today includes a solo from Lisa Renicker and Larry Culp.
[time=177] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "It's Real, My God is Real."
[time=194] We now know it's real, it's real, it's real, it's all the doubts are set on.
[time=208] Oh, I know, I know it's real.
[time=216] There are some things hiding I know, there are some places I can't own, but I am sure.
[time=230] I know it's real, I know it's real, I can feel it within the dead. I know it's real, it's real, it's all the real.
[time=230] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 154 seconds] I know it's real, I know it's real, I can feel it within the dead. I know it's real, it's real, it's...
[time=407] Amen. Praise God that what He said in the Scripture that He would make a way of salvation and He planned for eternity that had included you and I that accepted Jesus Christ as our personal Savior and it's real because He lives within our hearts.
[time=424] Let's continue our service today by turning to Him number 512. I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus the Nazarene and wonder how He could love me a sinner condemned unclean.
[time=438] Let's sing the first, second, excuse me, the first, fourth and fifth stanzas of this song.
[time=468] Let's sing the second, second, and second, second, and second, and second, and second, and second.
[time=496] Let's sing the first, second, and second, and second, and second.
[time=538] Let's sing the first, second, and second.
[time=565] Let's sing the first, second, and second, and second, and second, and second, and second.
[time=582] The love of God when He sent His Son to lay down His life for us, and we say amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=591] I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[time=612] That saved a wretch like me.
[time=627] I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see.
[time=657] It was grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.
[time=676] How precious did that grace of fear, the hour I found here?
[time=700] No many dangers, toils and swears, I have already come.
[time=724] It's grace that taught, he saved us all, and grace will lead me home.
[time=748] He saved us all, and grace will lead me home.
[time=817] Welcome to the Bible Hour, we hope that God uses this hour in your life to strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ and to encourage you spiritually.
[time=827] Peter, how is the Colby family today?
[time=836] For February, I suppose we should expect the snow, but January was so pleasant that this was a harsh wake-up called today.
[time=843] It was pleasant out this morning as I kind of gently pushed Andy out the door for his paper route.
[time=849] Well, we're looking forward to next Sunday morning. We hope the weather is better than today, and we want to ask you friends who are watching right now in Fort Wayne to consider coming and worshiping with us on February the 11th.
[time=863] That's the date this broadcast will air for our open house friend day.
[time=868] Here at Blackhawk, we have two morning worship services. They're identical, so you choose which one fits your needs best.
[time=874] The first one is at 9.15 in the morning, and the second one is at 10.50.
[time=880] We want to encourage you to come to our open house friend day.
[time=883] It's a day when we go all out to invite friends like you to come and experiencing our worship service live and in person.
[time=891] I know many of you have met me at the mall or introduced yourself to me and invented the Colosseum.
[time=897] You've told us what the Bible or means in your life.
[time=900] We want to ask you to take it a step further and come and join us personally today for our open house friend day.
[time=907] Peter, what can our friends look forward to musically?
[time=910] Well, as always, Rick, the choir will be singing, and the special ensemble reflection will be singing, and then we have a special guest that day, Chris Beatty.
[time=917] Chris Beatty is a choral coach, and he has helped many of our fine singers in Christian music today, such as Steve Green, Twyla Paris, Whiteheart,
[time=927] and a number of those groups and individuals that are beautiful singers and have a great message.
[time=932] He'll be here singing himself that morning.
[time=935] Well, great. We hope that you'll be here with us as well.
[time=939] Of course, we're thankful you join us by way of television, but if you're able, we want to encourage you Fort Wayne friends to come to friend day.
[time=946] February the 11th, here at Blackhawk, either at 915 or at 1050.
[time=952] Today, we have an excellent musical product to share with you.
[time=956] I want to brag on it because our church produced it.
[time=959] Now, you need to understand they pay me a lot not to be involved musically.
[time=963] I have no ability there. That's Peter's department.
[time=966] And let me just compliment you again that this album is one of the finest choir albums I've ever had the privilege of hearing.
[time=973] Well, thank you, Rick. It is always a privilege to hear it even in our local radio station.
[time=977] And it's a great tribute, really, to our people who have so faithfully given of their time to get prepared for this album.
[time=985] And it's available. I wanted to tell you a little bit about some of the songs with particular albums like a choir album.
[time=991] It's not quite as dated, so it lasts for a long time because some of the great faithful hymns of the faith are there, like holy, holy, holy.
[time=999] Honor the Lord with your song of praise. People need the Lord.
[time=1003] There are a great number of songs, Rick, that just go on forever as far as their quality and their inspiration to us.
[time=1009] Well, my favorite on this album is entitled, "He is the King of Glory."
[time=1015] Psalm 24 asks the question, "Who is the King of Glory?" And the answer is, "He is Jesus Christ." This song is powerful.
[time=1023] It's majestic. It's a medley.
[time=1025] Part of it comes from Handel's Messiah. It's a great album, and that's my favorite song.
[time=1030] Do you have a favorite?
[time=1032] Well, when I first heard people need the Lord, Rick, it had such a powerful message of seeing people on the street
[time=1040] and looking into their eyes and seeing an emptiness there that God could fill.
[time=1044] That's a powerful song, and I think that has the greatest message for me and the number of songs that we've done.
[time=1051] Well, those two songs and many others are on this album that the Black Hawk Choir has recorded.
[time=1057] And for the month of February, we are going to make it available to you if you'll simply write and ask for it.
[time=1063] You can receive this album, "Celebration of Praise by Writing to the Bible Hour." 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1076] Once again, that's the Bible Hour. 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1085] Thank you, Peter, and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1089] If you missed our address, we'll give it to you again at the close of this worship service.
[time=1094] We want to thank you for being with us by way of television and invite you to come and join us in person for February the 11th, "Friend Day Open House" here at Black Hawk.
[time=1106] [MUSIC - 252 seconds]
[time=1361] So still take each other passage, sins at all and heaven gave, sins at all and heaven gave all.
[time=1391] Our God and Father, we thank you today for the Lord Jesus Christ, for that place of
[time=1400] Calvary and what the Lord Jesus did for us there.
[time=1406] We today are grateful that you would love us while we are yet sinners, that Christ would
[time=1414] make an atonement for our lives while we run godly. We come today to praise you, to worship you,
[time=1422] and to tell you that we love you. We've set these moments aside to say that nothing is more important
[time=1428] in praising you. You are our God. You are our Creator and you are our Redeemer. We love you
[time=1437] and we worship you. We ask you by your spirit to meet with us and by your spirit to penetrate our
[time=1445] hearts. Drive the doubt out of our soul. Drive the darkness out of our spirit. Help us today to have
[time=1455] hope in Jesus Christ. We ask you to give confidence to those today who are walking through the tough
[time=1463] times. May they find that in your word there is insight and from your spirit there is encouragement.
[time=1469] We ask you to use this hour to lift your people up. We ask you to use this hour to magnify your name.
[time=1478] We confess to you that we are sinners and we pray like David did,
[time=1484] creating me a clean heart of God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cleans us, Lord,
[time=1491] washes, so that the worship of our lips can be acceptable, so the meditation of our hearts
[time=1498] will be pleasing to you. We ask you to meet with us to teach us principles for life. We ask you
[time=1506] to give strength to those particularly like Jason Crowell's family and friends who are suffering
[time=1512] to his loss. We ask you to refresh those today who need to have the strength of your spirit.
[time=1519] As we study today, please be our teacher in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1526] Three men, a father and his two married sons, were returning home from a trip.
[time=1534] The youngest proudly said, "You know, I know what my wife will be doing. She'll be waiting
[time=1540] right there for me to get home. When I get back, she'll be waiting." The older brother wanting to
[time=1548] one up his younger sibling said, "Why know my wife? She'll not only be waiting for me to return,
[time=1554] but she'll be watching. I can count on her that she'll be watching for me to return."
[time=1560] The father smiled and looked at his two sons and said, "Boys, the woman to be proud of is your
[time=1567] mother. She'll be waiting. She'll be watching. But she'll also be working until I return."
[time=1574] Jesus said, "I will return. What will you be doing till Christ returns?"
[time=1583] If you have a Bible, I want to invite you to open it to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2. And while
[time=1589] you're finding that book, allow me to retrace the background to set up our study for this day.
[time=1596] Paul had visited a city by the name of Thessaloniki. It's a great city in the land of Macedonia
[time=1603] to the northern part of Greece on the Aegean Sea. Their Paul preached and told them about Jesus
[time=1609] Christ and they became believers and established a church. He not only told them that Christ had come,
[time=1616] but he told them that Christ will come again. He told them that there was coming a day when
[time=1622] Jesus would come to the clouds and with a shout with the blowing of the trumpet of God,
[time=1628] he would rapture. That's a Latin word that means to reach down and to grab or to seize.
[time=1633] That he would rapture the bodies of dead Christians and living Christians in two steps,
[time=1640] boom, boom, and he would take them to heaven. Now he wrote that in a letter that we call first
[time=1647] Thessalonians. The people had some questions and the rumor mill got turning.
[time=1654] And the rumors got back to the church of Thessaloniki that Jesus had already come.
[time=1660] And this was the end of the world. Some of them panicked and needed encouraged. Others of them
[time=1668] took a different option. They said, hey, if Jesus is already coming and the world's going to end, we might as well live it up. I mean, I can't stand my boss and the reality of it is, world's not going to be here too much longer. I think I'll just go in there and today I'm going to tell him off. And just before he says, you're fired, I'll say, no, I'm not. I quit. I mean,
[time=1688] why keep working? The world's going to end. Others of them said, I'm going to write out that mortgage
[time=1694] payment month after month. I mean, if the world's going to end in the next few weeks or the next months, I might as well spend it all. I won't be here to be found anyway. Remind to me of a sign
[time=1705] we saw at a restaurant. You go through, you order your food and just before you pay, they have the most delicious desserts you can imagine. And the sign says, life is too uncertain. Eat your dessert
[time=1719] first. And that was the philosophy that some of these people bought in. Hey, life's too uncertain.
[time=1725] You don't know if you're going to be here. So eat your dessert now. Don't worry about your job.
[time=1729] And so they're equating their jobs and neglecting their responsibilities. Chapter three is
[time=1736] written to correct the irresponsible behavior on the part of Christians then and now.
[time=1743] In this chapter, we'll find our two greatest responsibilities to carry out until Christ returns.
[time=1752] The first one is found in verses one through six. Let me read those verses for you.
[time=1758] Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored
[time=1766] just as it was with you. And pray that we may be delivered from the wicked and evil men,
[time=1773] for not everyone has faith, but the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you
[time=1780] from the evil one. We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do
[time=1786] the things we commanded. May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance.
[time=1796] The first responsibility we have in light of Christ's return is to earnestly pray.
[time=1807] Someone has wisely said that the great men and women are not those who talk about prayer,
[time=1814] not those who teach about prayer, but those who actually pray. We are Americans, and Americans
[time=1823] are doers, and if there's not something to do, we create something to do. I'm that way. We call it
[time=1829] type A personality, and it's hard to find some of us who are not a type A personality. I'm that
[time=1835] way, guilty. We went on vacation to Florida, and you know, type A personality. You have to get there, then you have to vacation. When vacation, you've got to get back. So we drive straight through from Florida. We got home at 10 o'clock in the morning, and I said to Kathy, you know, we got this day. What are we going to do? I don't have to go to work till tomorrow. So we ordered 10 tons of stone and landscaped the whole yard that day. That's just American personality, isn't it?
[time=1858] Just do something. But here's the flaw with type A personality. Here's the flaw with the do
[time=1864] something type thinking. We don't place a premium on prayer.
[time=1869] And the Bible says the most important thing that we can do in light of Christ's return
[time=1878] is to pray. Now talk about it. Not teach about it. Just do it. It's like diets. There is a new diet
[time=1887] discovered every day. And people write about diets. People read about diets. People do everything you
[time=1895] can do with a diet, but diet. People read about prayer. People talk about prayer. People study
[time=1902] about pray. But we, as a culture, don't pray. We think, well, you know, I have to do something.
[time=1910] Charles had this virgin, I think, balanced out the doing and the praying. He said, I work like it's up to me and I pray like it's all up to God. That's good balance.
[time=1920] In this passage, he gives us three specific things to pray about. First thing he tells us to
[time=1927] pray about is the progress of God's message. Look at verse one. Finally, brothers, pray for us
[time=1937] that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored just as it was with you. Paul's
[time=1947] first prayer request was that they would pray for the progress of God's message.
[time=1955] He didn't ask him to pray about his thorn in the flesh. He didn't ask him to pray about
[time=1961] their missions giving to his next trip. He didn't ask him to pray for the health of four to eleven of the saints who were afflicted. He asked them to pray for the spread of the gospel.
[time=1973] In fact, in his life, everything else hinged on the spread of the gospel. They locked him in
[time=1981] prison and he said, fine, it's going to advance the gospel. Paul was an individual who did not care
[time=1988] what it cost or who got the glory as long as the gospel was being preached. He had quite
[time=1995] a resume. I mean, he'd have one of those resumes that would make him highly employable.
[time=2001] On this side of the ledger, when he wanted to appeal to the Hebrews, he was a Hebrew, the Hebrew,
[time=2007] born of the right tribe, educated in the right way. He was a Pharisee. He was a member of the Sanhedrin. He was somebody. On the secular side, he was skilled and trained in the highest university
[time=2021] of the day. He was a Roman citizen, something that less than one-tenth of the population of the
[time=2027] empire could claim. And this was a man's man. He was a man for all times. And he looked at his
[time=2036] resume and he said, I count all of that as absolute loss for the excellency of knowing Christ and
[time=2045] making him known. Paul said, all those things don't add up. This is what life's about.
[time=2051] And if you want to pray for something, he said, pray for the spread of God's message,
[time=2059] pray for its progress that it would be received rapidly and that it would be honored.
[time=2065] Second thing he tells us to pray for is pray for the protection of God's hand,
[time=2071] verse two, and pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men for not everyone has faith.
[time=2078] Second verse that follows, but the Lord is faithful and he will strengthen and protect
[time=2085] you from the evil one. Second thing we should be praying about is protection of God's hand.
[time=2092] Now we live in great peace and great prosperity. These verses are almost foreign to us. But you
[time=2099] know what's not foreign right now to Mike and Carolyn Ballast as their ambassadors for Christ and an extension to this church in Manila. While the Manila government is very pro-American and
[time=2110] open to missions, there is a growing faction of communists who make as their targets missionaries.
[time=2117] We need to pray for the progress of the gospel, Manila, and we need to pray for the protection of
[time=2124] God's hand on Mike and Carolyn Ballast. We need to pray for the churches that we support in Jamaica
[time=2132] because in Jamaica there are those that are very pro-American but there are those who are communist and who hate the influence of anyone who is American and anyone who is white. We need
[time=2144] to pray for missionaries who are going into the Islamic countries where in their lands it is a crime
[time=2152] to defect and become a Christian. The Bible tells us that our strength is not in the fact that we're
[time=2162] an American or that we have a passport that our government can rescue us if we're in Panama.
[time=2167] Our protection is the hand of the Lord. Psalm 121, the Psalmist said, "I will lift up my eyes
[time=2176] under the hills." That was Israel's security. That was their fortress, the mountains. "I will lift
[time=2182] up my eyes under the hills from whence comes my strength from those mountains, from those cliffs,
[time=2188] from those barriers that can keep the clinicians out or the edamites contained." Lift up my eyes into the hills from whence comes with my strength. My strength comes from the Lord.
[time=2201] You see God's hand can deliver you where no one else can rescue you and God can keep you from
[time=2207] being delivered if that's his will when it would seem that anybody could rescue you.
[time=2212] I am so thankful to be an American for all that our country affords us but all the things that we
[time=2219] think we have that can protect us and be our security aren't all that secure. First mission
[time=2226] strip I ever took was a real learning experience. I did all the things that you were supposed to do
[time=2232] to be secure. I took more credit cards than I carried to carry and I also didn't leave home
[time=2239] without my American Express traveler's checks. Now we're in Japan, one of the most economically
[time=2247] advanced countries in the world. We're in the city of Kofu. It's as big as the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=2253] We went to the largest department store, wanted to make a purchase, showed them my credit card.
[time=2258] I didn't speak Japanese. They didn't speak English but we had an international head nod conversation. I showed them my credit card and they went, "No problem." Showed them a different
[time=2269] credit card. They smiled and went, "Showed them a third credit card." They smiled and said, "No."
[time=2276] I said to Kathy so much for these being universally worldwide received, we'll have to use an American Express traveler's check. I showed them one of those and immediately he began to talk very loud in
[time=2288] Japanese and half a dozen employees came over. They had never seen a traveler's check before.
[time=2294] Their five minutes of studying this traveler's check led them all to laughing and throwing it back
[time=2300] at me and one more time going. What great security. Don't leave home without it. It'll protect you.
[time=2309] We'll get you money anywhere in the world. Try Kofu, Japan.
[time=2312] You know, we trust in our economics. We trust in our military. We trust in our intelligence.
[time=2321] And yet if God wants to rescue us, he can rescue us where no dollars can be reached.
[time=2328] And if he doesn't want us to be delivered from a situation, he can hold us contained there when it would seem the easiest place in the world to escape from.
[time=2339] We need to be praying earnestly for God's protection because he is our strength.
[time=2346] I will lift up my eyes into the military. I will lift up my eyes into the bangs.
[time=2352] I will lift up my eyes under education. From whence comes my strength? It comes from the Lord.
[time=2358] He who watches over Israel will never sleep or slumber. We need to pray for the protection
[time=2367] of God's hand. Third thing it tells us to do is that we should pray for the provision of God's
[time=2373] strength. Verse 5, "May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance."
[time=2381] How was Paul going to make it? How were the Thessal and Ikin people going to make it?
[time=2387] How was that church going to make in roads? How are you going to penetrate East Allen County school system? How are you going to penetrate Magnavox? How are you going to penetrate your real estate
[time=2398] office? How are you going to reach a cul-de-sac that you call home for Christ? Where will the strength come from? How will you have the perseverance? My prayer. It's more important to talk to God
[time=2413] about men than it is to talk to men about God. Those timeless words of Lewis Spirit, Shafer,
[time=2419] ought to be the watchword of our hearts. Talk to God about men. Pray for God's strength
[time=2425] that you might see the gospel progress through your own witness. One of the things we've often
[time=2432] done to keep ourselves in check when somebody says, "You know, I think I will." And the rest of us
[time=2438] think you shouldn't. We say, "You don't want to do that. I mean, what if you were there when Jesus
[time=2444] came back?" That strategy is not all bad, but it's not very logical. Think of the poor guy who
[time=2454] serves Christ faithfully day in, day out, day in living, sacrificially draining himself of energy
[time=2460] and finally says, "I'm exhausted. I at least need to day off." He takes that day off and Christ comes.
[time=2467] Oh, way to go, buddy. Jesus came and you were in bed. Jesus isn't going to be fooled by that.
[time=2473] We're not asking you to keep one eye in the clouds, and as soon as you see Jesus come, hit your knees and pray. These are principles to be lived by every day in light of the fact that
[time=2485] He is coming, not principles to try to figure out how can we be found doing it that last second.
[time=2490] When my sister and I were growing up, our favorite babysitter was an older girl in the neighborhood by the name of Peggy. Peggy had come over and my parents would say, "Rick and melding need to be
[time=2501] in bed by 8.30." And Peggy'd say, "Okay." And they'd say, "They need to have the rooms cleaned up by eight o'clock." And she'd say, "Okay." And my mom and dad would go through all the rules and then finally say, "We'll be home about 11." So Peggy went a step to 11. And as soon as we saw headlights
[time=2517] come in the driveway, she'd let out a wild whistle and we'd run to our beds and dive in.
[time=2524] And we were in bed when our parents returned. I didn't realize that my parents were a little
[time=2531] smarter than I was. And they figured out that I didn't just go to bed with my shoes and clothes on. And when you're five years old and you want somebody to think you're sleeping, you go like this. You don't close your eyes. You just squeeze them and shut you down and we're really sleeping now.
[time=2545] You know, mom and dad weren't fooled. They didn't think that I had lived the way they wanted me to live.
[time=2554] The whole time they were gone. They saw that it was a last ditch effort. And Jesus isn't going to
[time=2562] evaluate how you spend the last 10 seconds before he comes. He's going to evaluate how you live your
[time=2570] life every day in light of the fact that he may come. And the first responsibility we have
[time=2576] is to be praying earnestly till he comes. Responsibility number two is found in verses
[time=2583] six through 15. It is this one to eagerly work until Christ returns. He's going to give us some
[time=2593] instructions, some illustrations, and then some indictments. First of all, look at verses 6, 10,
[time=2601] and 11. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command your brothers to keep away from every
[time=2608] brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us. Now verse 10,
[time=2615] "For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule. If a man does not work, he shall not eat."
[time=2624] We hear that there are some among you who are idle. They are not busy. They are busy bodies.
[time=2631] The instructions he gives are twofold. The first instruction is found in verse 10.
[time=2638] I'm going to give it to you before we get the instruction in verse six, because verse 10
[time=2644] is what he taught them when he was there with them prior to writing this letter.
[time=2649] Simple statement. You don't have to have a high IQ to figure it out. Here it is. If you don't work,
[time=2655] you shouldn't get to eat. If you don't work, you shouldn't get to eat. See, some of these people
[time=2663] had quit their jobs. They were trying to live off of the common benevolence of the church.
[time=2669] Saying, "Jesus is coming. I'm not going to work." And all of a sudden Jesus wasn't there as soon as he was going to be there. And they were saying, "Well, how am I supposed to eat? Where's my food going to come from?" And the Apostle Paul had this great compassionate statement. If you don't work, you don't eat. Now, I'd like to make some applications. These are my opinions.
[time=2691] I think they're led to and concluding from this principle. But I also want you to know that these
[time=2699] are my opinions. I want to give you a political one, and then I want to give you a personal one.
[time=2704] There's this continuum. On the right, there are conservatives, and on the left, there are liberals.
[time=2708] And it's probably no secret I fall on the conservative side of the ledger most of the time.
[time=2715] Remember this story I told it to you before. The liberal sees a man drowning 100 feet offshore,
[time=2721] throws him 200 foot of line, and then drops his end to go do another good deed.
[time=2726] The conservative sees a man drowning 50 feet offshore, and throws him 25 feet of line and yells,
[time=2733] "Kick for it. It'll build character." Now, somewhere between the extremes of the liberals and the conservatives, there's got to be a balance. Now, being more inclined to being conservative,
[time=2746] I want to repeat a good word that somebody laid on me. I was explaining all my conservative values,
[time=2753] and he said, "Rick, I understand that. But would you just think about this?" I've discovered that there
[time=2759] are more conservatives on your end to town, because they are the people that have more to conserve.
[time=2765] That's a pretty good word. I wanted to share it with you, because I'm about to give some
[time=2773] conservative opinions, and yet I wanted to frame them and temper them. So here they are politically. I'm daydreaming. President Bush has just called me on the phone, and he says, "Rick,
[time=2783] what should I do with the American welfare system?" Well, President Bush, I only have a moment, but let me tell you what to do. Our welfare system ought to have two factors in it that
[time=2794] doesn't have. The first thing it should be is that it ought to be a work supplement, not a work substitute. Let me explain that. If somebody has the ability to work, I'm not talking
[time=2807] about the disabled or the retired. I'm talking about those who are able to work. If a man or a
[time=2813] woman is able to work, I don't think we ought to give them a penny as a substitute for work.
[time=2820] I think we ought to say go find a job, and if your job is inadequate, we'll subsidize that work,
[time=2827] but we won't hand it to you without working. Commonly, people come in, and they're talking about their economic problems, and I'm not talking about the person who was temporarily laid off or between jobs. I mean, the guy who just can't keep a job, he says, "I can't find a job anywhere." My advice is go out my office door. Five steps, turn to your right. There's a bulletin board, and there are jobs posted there. There are jobs like working in McDonald's. Now, I have to admit,
[time=2854] I don't want to work in McDonald's. I don't want to slide across the floor to fry the fries and shake the shakes, but if it's a matter of whether you're going to eat or not, you've got to shake
[time=2864] the shakes and fry the fries. And if we're going to have a welfare system, I believe it ought to subsidize that man who's working, not just say, "Oh, you didn't find a job, here's your doll,"
[time=2874] and hand it out. The second thing I think a lot of have is a lot of have a sunset. Do you know what
[time=2881] sunset legislation is? It's legislation that says we're enacting the law today, and it goes this long,
[time=2887] and then the sun goes down, and it's over. We ought to say to people, we understand that we are a
[time=2894] nation who on paper are born equally, but in reality, we are not born equally.
[time=2901] Let me give you an illustration. My grandfather was born in the hills of Appalachia,
[time=2909] poor and impoverished. They moved to Akron, Ohio. He worked in the rubber factories, only having an eighth grade education. He and my father started a business. My father finished
[time=2921] high school, and when I was born, there was this nice little family business. There was a nice income, and I sat down at the table that was full and fixed. Not everybody in America is born
[time=2931] into a family with the privileges that I had. I'm aware of that, and I think it's wonderful
[time=2938] if our government can help those who aren't born as well off as Rick was to get started.
[time=2945] But I believe that a welfare system ought to say, "If you need help, you can come in and we'll give
[time=2951] you this much money for this period of time," and then it's going to start to taper off, and then at this date, it's ended, and you can go through the system one time.
[time=2959] But at ours is set up, you get in the system and you can stay in the system forever,
[time=2967] and if you should have the bad luck of falling out of the system, you can get back into the system.
[time=2975] A very simple principle, if a man doesn't work, he ought not to eat. Let me tell you how we apply
[time=2982] that here. If you don't agree with this, you can write me a note. Write me a very short little note.
[time=2990] Then you don't even have to mail it if you don't want to.
[time=2994] As a church, we have people come to us with financial needs. We quickly divide them into two groups.
[time=3004] Those who are part of our church family, who we have a responsibility to as brothers and sisters, we handle that in a different way. Then there's the other person. They don't go to Blackhawk.
[time=3014] They're not a part of our church family, and it's usually a need for $25, $50, some immediate
[time=3021] emergency. Over the years, we've learned that about half of those are legitimate, and about half of
[time=3028] them are not. Half of those are people who have a need, and somebody ought to help them, and that may be us. The other half of them are people who they told the same story. Our neighbors at Saint
[time=3039] Peter's Lutheran, they're here, they're on their way to Faith Baptist, and they're just making the loop.
[time=3044] Now, for $25 or $50, we can, A, take one of our staff members and have them spend about two days
[time=3051] trying to figure out whether it's legitimate or not. That's poor management of human resources,
[time=3058] and we've spent more than the $25 or $50 they've asked for. So here's what we do. We say we understand
[time=3064] you have an immediate need, here's what we're willing to do. If you're willing to go to work right now, we'll give you what you need. If you need $25, $50, we'll just give that to you,
[time=3074] but what you have to do is here's our maintenance supervisor, and he's going to put you to work.
[time=3078] We don't make it a dollar per hour ratio. It's not like they're making minimum wage or $10, we're just saying if you're willing to work, we're willing to help. And what happens is about half of the people say thank you. What do you want me to do? And they dig in and they do something and we are happy to help them. And the other half of the people always tell you why they couldn't possibly do that. And to them we say, man doesn't work, not to eat. Bible.
[time=3110] Not Republican, not conservative, not Democrat, not liberal. Bible. You want to argue, take it
[time=3117] up with the author. If they're willing to work, we'll help them. Now we're not smart enough to
[time=3126] come up. You know where that came from? It came from the Old Testament. Almost everybody was a farmer. And when you went out to harvest your field, you weren't allowed to take everything out.
[time=3136] You had to leave some of the grain behind. And then the poor and the needy, they were allowed to go out in your field and collect what was left. It was called "gleaning." And you were to leave some in the field. And it's a work welfare. It says, if you're not willing, go out in the field
[time=3152] and pick up the grain. Don't ask for a handout from my silo. But it was also saying, we're going
[time=3158] to purposefully have resources available to help the poor. Well, I'm spending too much time here.
[time=3166] A second application, this is a personal one. Don't buy your children's tickets through life.
[time=3176] Don't buy your children their tickets through life. I'm not saying don't help your kids. I'm saying
[time=3188] teach them as early in life as you can, the responsibility to save, to invest, and to plan for the future, and help them to learn that everything isn't free. We were on vacation at a
[time=3200] wonderful, wonderful resort that where you check in, they give you a little identification card.
[time=3206] And then when you go to the snack shop, you just show them the card and they'll bill it to your room.
[time=3211] Rebecca was two years old. She wanted one too many snacks at the snack shop. And so we said, no.
[time=3219] She said, well, why? And I said, well, you've had too many. I don't have any money with you, with me. She said, at age two, write a check. I said, I don't have the checkbook. She said,
[time=3229] well, then use your card. And in the truth, I didn't have the card. So she turned to some
[time=3235] friends next to us and said, do you have your card? I mean, kids, if we don't teach them,
[time=3241] they grow up saying, don't you have a card? Don't you have a check? Hand it.
[time=3246] A friend of mine, I'm not saying that the dollars are right or wrong, but the philosophy for sure is.
[time=3254] He was fairly well off. He's rich. Cut through it all. He said to his grown son, here's the deal.
[time=3265] You pick out whatever college you want to and you can get into and I'll pay half.
[time=3269] If you want to go to the large state school where it's only going to cost four or five thousand, I'll pay half. If you can qualify and you want to go to Harvard where it's five times that, I'll still pay half. I'm not saying half is right or wrong. I'm just saying the principle
[time=3283] of teaching that life is to be earned is a great value. Because what happens is there's an awful
[time=3290] lot of second generation people who don't think that work is a prerequisite to eating and it is.
[time=3299] Well, I'm talking too much on one point. The second instruction he gives you is this one.
[time=3303] It's found in verses six and verse 14 and 15. To summarize it, he says,
[time=3309] not only shouldn't they eat, but they shouldn't have the privilege of being a part of your
[time=3315] fellowship either. If you didn't like the first principle, you're going to hate the second one.
[time=3320] I like to paraphrase it this way. If somebody doesn't eat, don't carry the ball with them
[time=3327] and don't even play ball with them. That's a consistent theme of Scripture. We call it separation.
[time=3335] You know, it's a matter of godliness, whether you work. Not saying that you have to work 40 hours
[time=3341] or you're lazy or you have to be doing manual, but work is godly. And if you're lazy, you're ungodly.
[time=3347] And so a second instruction is separate yourself off from those who are lazy.
[time=3353] Here's his illustration. His illustration in this passage is on his own life in verses seven through
[time=3360] nine. He said, "When I was with you, I worked. I didn't just work preaching the gospel. I work in a
[time=3369] secular employment so that we didn't pass the offering plate." Paul said, "My own life is an illustration to you people that even though you know Christ and you think that he's coming back, you ought to be out there working." In his case, he was a tent maker. Verse seven, "For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you nor did we
[time=3392] any man's food without paying for it on the contrary. We worked night and day laboring and toying so that we would not be a burden to any of you. We did this not because we did not have the
[time=3404] right to such help but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow." Two things he says.
[time=3410] One, he chose to work rather than pass the offering plate to teach them how to work. Second
[time=3418] thing that he says by way of illustration of his life is he's, but we did have the right to do that.
[time=3423] In 1 Corinthians 9, he says, "The workman is worthy of his hire." And the 1 Timothy says that those
[time=3430] who teach in the church are worthy of being paid for making that a full time, but they ought to be
[time=3436] working at that. Two indictments. Some of you are not busy. That's indictment number one.
[time=3445] Indictment number two. Some of you are busy bodies. You know there is a strong parallel
[time=3452] and a strong correlation. Those who fail to be busy are those who are most likely to be busy
[time=3458] bodies. Those who are most quick to criticize or to gossip are those who are not pooling their own
[time=3465] weight.
[time=3479] It's been our privilege once again to share with you the musical ministry of our sanctuary choir,
[time=3485] Lisa Reniker and Larry Culp, and our orchestra also joined us today. The message was from our
[time=3492] pastor Rick Hawks. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. Dear Heavenly Father,
[time=3504] I am thankful that you sent your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins. And today I have
[time=3510] a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you that you will forgive me of the sins that I've
[time=3516] committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen. If you prayed that prayer today,
[time=3524] would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3535] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or a copy of the album entitled Celebration of Praise,
