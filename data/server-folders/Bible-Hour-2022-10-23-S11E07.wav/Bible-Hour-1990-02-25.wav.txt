[time=99] At New York's Nicobocker Club, a group of Mark Twain's friends realized that it was his birthday. So they wrote him a long nonsensical card, but had no idea where to mail it. For the humor of it, they wrote an address, Mark Twain, the Lord knows where, and dropped it in the mailbox. A number of months later, they got a reply back.
[time=119] It simply said, "He did, Mark Twain."
[time=123] [MUSIC]
[time=133] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Cox. Thank you for joining us. Rick's message today is entitled, "You Can Run, But You Cannot Hide."
[time=142] The Lord knew where Mark Twain was, and he knows where you are today. More than that, he knows every need, fear, and hope of your life. His presence is inescapable. Jonah attempted to run from God, but everywhere he turned, God was there. On the land, on the boat, in the sea, even in the great fish. God is always there.
[time=162] Perhaps you, like Jonah, are running from God. This study in the life of Jonah is meant for you. Please open your Bibles to the Book of Jonah and your hearts to God's Spirit as we study today.
[time=174] Our special musical guest today is Chris Beatty. Other music includes a song from Reflection.
[time=184] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "Seakers of Your Heart."
[time=192] [MUSIC]
[time=206] Until we give you a first place, until we let you begin. To fill us with your spirit, renew us from within. Nothing matters.
[time=235] Nothing changes without your only presence. Our lives are built in pain. Lord, we want to know you.
[time=258] May the lights to show you all the love we own you. We sing "Seakers of Your Heart."
[time=281] Because your heart was broken, because you saw the need, because you gave so freely, because of help of me.
[time=305] We can now believe, come your own, and we can be nations, live with you alone.
[time=327] Lord, we want to know you. May the lights to show you all the love we own.
[time=345] We sing "Seakers of Your Heart."
[time=357] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=367] May the lights to show you all the love we own you.
[time=383] May the speakers of your heart.
[time=393] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=400] May the lights to show you all the love we own you.
[time=416] We sing "Seakers of Your Heart."
[time=440] Lord, we want to know you. May the lights to show you all the love we own you.
[time=460] We sing "Seakers of Your Heart."
[time=469] Lord, we want to know you. May the lights to show you all the love we own you.
[time=489] We sing "Seakers of Your Heart."
[time=499] Amen. We've had a wonderful weekend of music, starting off on Friday evening with a music seminar by Carol and Chris Beatty.
[time=508] And then all day yesterday, contestants competing for various awards.
[time=514] The Marvelous concert last night with Ray Bolz and Priscilla Ingle and some of the winners of that contest yesterday.
[time=522] Staying over for us on this weekend and on Sunday morning as Chris Beatty, we appreciated his ministries throughout the weekend, helped our own choir, and we expect to learn many things and incorporate them, we hope, into our music program.
[time=535] As a Marvelous voice, a real love for the Lord, and we're just indeed thankful that he's here today to minister to us, let's listen intently to his message to us through music.
[time=550] And King David stood before his congregation, Israel, and he sang, "This is holy ground.
[time=563] We're standing unholy ground, for the Lord is present, and where he is is holy.
[time=583] This is holy ground. We're standing unholy ground.
[time=596] For the Lord is present, and where he is is holy.
[time=608] And these are holy hands. He's given us holy hands.
[time=621] He works through these hands, and so these hands are holy.
[time=633] These are holy hands. He's given us holy hands.
[time=645] He works through these hands, and so these hands are holy.
[time=657] And these are holy lips. He's given us holy lips.
[time=670] He speaks through these lips, and so these lips are holy.
[time=682] These are holy lips. He's given us holy lips.
[time=694] He sings through our lips, and so our lips are holy.
[time=706] And this is holy time. He's given us holy time.
[time=720] Time is his, and he's given us this holy time.
[time=733] This is holy time. He's given us holy time.
[time=746] Time is yours, Lord, and you've given us this holy time.
[time=775] And after David had sung that for his congregation, Israel, he sang these words.
[time=786] We can now read them in Psalm 72. May his name endure forever.
[time=792] May his name increase for as long as the sun shines.
[time=796] Bless it be the Lord. Bless it be the Lord God of Israel.
[time=809] May his name endure forever.
[time=816] May his name increase for as long as the sun shines.
[time=823] Bless it be the Lord. Bless it be the Lord God of Israel.
[time=836] May the earth be filled with his glory.
[time=843] Let all nations call him blessed. Bless it be the Lord.
[time=853] Bless it be the Lord God of Israel.
[time=863] Let us make the Lord God our refuge.
[time=871] Let us seek his will and obey it.
[time=877] And let us all be changed. Let us all be changed to his likeness.
[time=887] May his name endure forever.
[time=895] May his name increase for as long as the sun shines.
[time=902] Bless it be the Lord. Bless it be the Lord God of Israel.
[time=913] Oh God of Israel. God of Israel.
[time=928] God of Israel.
[time=958] Hello again and thank you for joining us today for the Bible hour.
[time=964] Today is friend day here at Blackhawk and we have a great number of guests.
[time=968] We're excited to see them. But we're also thrilled that you've joined us by way of television.
[time=973] Along with our guests that we've invited here from our community, we have a special musical guest as well.
[time=979] Yes, Chris and Carol Beatty are with us Rick. They've been here for the entire weekend for our choral contest.
[time=985] We've had a great time with them and Ray Bolz and Priscilla Angle and a concert last night.
[time=990] It was really a great time and Chris has chosen to remain with us today and minister to us in song.
[time=995] He does have a beautiful voice. He's coached many of the singers that we're familiar with that we hear on the local radio stations.
[time=1002] People like Steve Green and who else?
[time=1004] Well, Twyla Paris, Whiteheart, Petra, many of the singers that we're accustomed to hearing.
[time=1012] Well, you've had the privilege of hearing him just before we took these few moments to talk with you and you'll hear them again when we return to our morning worship service in just a few moments.
[time=1022] Today, we also have another musical treat for you.
[time=1025] We have the privilege of sharing with you an excellent top-rate album that our choir recorded a few months back.
[time=1032] This is a first-cut copy. It is not a reject. It's not something that wasn't up to quality.
[time=1037] This is a first-run edition. We're thrilled that we can share it with you friends.
[time=1042] We've used this album in our home a number of times as just a form of entertainment and then suddenly the entertainment turned to worship.
[time=1049] And that's what the album is about and even titled.
[time=1052] That's right, Rick. We're titled it celebration of praise and certainly we are thankful for what God did for us
[time=1058] and giving us eternal life. Most of the songs are familiar songs that just give an uplifting spirit
[time=1064] and that was our sole purpose for recording this music.
[time=1068] Well, we have these available and we have the privilege of sharing them with you.
[time=1072] So if you would like a copy of this excellent album, simply write to us today and we'll make sure you get one right away.
[time=1079] You can receive a copy of this album by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1086] and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1099] Well, this has been a big weekend here in Fort Wayne. We had the Sing for Joy program here at Blackhawk.
[time=1106] Chuck Colson came to town. A new pastor was installed in one of our sister churches.
[time=1111] But yet with all that has happened this weekend, there are still great days ahead and we're looking forward to some friends of ours coming back to Fort Wayne, back home to Blackhawk.
[time=1120] Well, Stephen Maria formerly lived in Fort Wayne and left Fort Wayne to sing around the country.
[time=1127] They recently left and gone to California and they're heading back to the East Coast and we were fortunate enough to ask them to stop in the Fort Wayne area on Sunday morning March 18.
[time=1138] So you might want to write that date on your calendar. It's just a few weeks away.
[time=1142] But if you know Stephen Maria Gardner and you love their music, they'll be with us that Sunday morning.
[time=1147] It'll be a great time of reunion again to see them.
[time=1150] Well, we're looking forward to Stephen Maria being here and we're looking forward to these next moments as Chris Beatty comes back to sing, our church group sings called Reflection, and today I'm beginning a new study on the Book of Jonah.
[time=1163] I hope you'll open your heart and your Bible to God's Word.
[time=1166] Thanks for being a part of the Bible Hour today.
[time=1172] Thank you very much.
[time=1179] I was happy to answer it.
[time=1181] Thank you.
[time=1183] [MUSIC - 250 seconds]
[time=1449] Our God and Father, we do give to you today the sacrifices of joy.
[time=1454] We love you today and we've come to this place to declare our devotion and allegiance to you.
[time=1461] You have captured our hearts.
[time=1463] You have seized our imagination through the songs that we've heard and through those that we have sung ourselves.
[time=1470] We today have come to declare your greatness and to thank you for your goodness.
[time=1476] We love you Lord and we thank you for this privilege of ours in giving praise and adoration to your name.
[time=1484] We ask you to meet with us and to accept these gifts of ours, our devotion, our worship, our gratitude.
[time=1494] We ask you to cleanse us and wash us.
[time=1497] We ask you to make our hands holy and our lips holy and our time holy through Jesus Christ.
[time=1504] Oh God, we are overflowing today.
[time=1507] Our cup, our hearts are overflowing.
[time=1511] You have encouraged, you have strengthened us and we are so thankful.
[time=1517] We ask you today by this hour of praise to bring glory and honor to your name.
[time=1523] May there be those today who've never received Christ that today find your Holy Spirit knocking at the door of their soul.
[time=1532] May there be those who have fallen away from a walk of faith return to a walk of obedience.
[time=1540] And so today we ask you to meet with us and buy your grace to fill our hearts.
[time=1547] Give us a hunger for righteousness.
[time=1549] Help us today to mirror the righteousness of God in our walk.
[time=1554] May this church have salt and light as its characteristics.
[time=1558] May we have an impact on our society that is directing and preserving.
[time=1563] We want to thank you for our country.
[time=1566] For the freedom and the prosperity that it affords.
[time=1569] That we can worship you today.
[time=1571] More than that, we thank you for Jesus Christ who gives freedom to our hearts.
[time=1576] For it's in His name that we pray.
[time=1579] [AMEN]
[time=1588] ♪
[time=1594] Why does my heart rejoice and sing when all around is despair?
[time=1604] How can I face tomorrow when the world is cold and unfair?
[time=1614] You ask me why I wear this smile, stand when others would fall.

[time=1773] [AMEN]
[time=1782] Chris, we cannot thank you enough for your ministry to us today.
[time=1786] It's not only one of excellence, but it's one that exalts the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1791] And that is our purpose, why we've come to sing and to study and to worship.
[time=1796] If you have a Bible, I want to invite you to open yours to the Book of Jonah.
[time=1801] Your Bible may not flop right open to that short book of the minor prophets.
[time=1806] If you need a little help at the beginning of your Bible, there'll be a table of contents.
[time=1810] Take just a moment to look up the page number and find your way to Jonah.
[time=1815] I would like to read for you Jonah chapter 1 to begin our study today.
[time=1821] The word of the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amatai.
[time=1826] Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me.
[time=1835] But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for tarshes.
[time=1839] He went down to Japa where he found a ship bound for that port.
[time=1843] After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed to Tarshes to flee from the Lord.
[time=1852] Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up.
[time=1861] All the sailors were afraid, and each one began to cry out and it was on God.
[time=1868] And they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
[time=1873] But Jonah had gone below deck where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
[time=1880] The captain went to him and said, "How can you sleep?
[time=1884] Get up and call on your God.
[time=1886] Maybe he will take notice of us, and we will not perish." And the sailor said to each other, "Come.
[time=1894] Let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity."
[time=1900] They cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
[time=1907] So they asked him, "Tell us, who is responsible for making all this trouble for us?
[time=1913] What do you do?
[time=1914] Where do you come from?
[time=1915] What is your country?
[time=1916] From what people are you?" He answered, "I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven who made the sea and the earth.
[time=1930] This terrified them." And they asked, "What have you done?" They knew he was running away from the Lord because he had already told them so.
[time=1943] The sea was getting rougher and rougher.
[time=1946] So they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?"
[time=1952] "Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied, "and it will become calm.
[time=1962] I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you."
[time=1969] Instead, the men did their best to row back to land, but they could not.
[time=1974] For the sea grew even louder than before.
[time=1978] Then they cried to the Lord, "Oh Lord, please do not let us die for taking this man's life.
[time=1985] Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man for you, O Lord.
[time=1990] Have done as you pleased." Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard.
[time=1997] And the raging sea grew calm.
[time=2000] At this, the men greatly feared the Lord.
[time=2003] And they made an offering a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows to him.
[time=2010] But the Lord provided a great fish to swallow Jonah.
[time=2014] And Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights.
[time=2022] In the dark pages of U.S. history, there was a gangster era.
[time=2027] It was a time of prohibition.
[time=2030] It was a time of speakeasies.
[time=2033] It was a time of bootleggers and criminals.
[time=2037] Perhaps the most famous of all those was Scarface al Capone.
[time=2043] For over a decade, al Capone ran a bootlegging and an extortion racket on Chicago's south side.
[time=2051] Through their best attempts, however, the police were never able to arrest
[time=2057] and successfully bring al Capone to trial.
[time=2062] But then he was nabbed on all things, a charge of income tax evasion.
[time=2068] He went to prison for eleven years.
[time=2071] He was released after eight years because he was terminally ill with syphilis.
[time=2077] He ran.
[time=2079] But as Kenny Rogers saying, "You can't outrun the long arm of the law."
[time=2086] In those same days, there was the infamous couple Bonnie and Clyde.
[time=2090] Bonnie Parker and Clyde Darryl had gone on a four year spree of shooting in robberies
[time=2097] from the Midwest to the Southwest.
[time=2100] They seemed invincible and unstoppable until they were surrounded by agents and shot to death.
[time=2108] You can't outrun the long arm of the law.
[time=2113] In those same era, John Dillinger was named as FBI's public enemy number one.
[time=2121] Two times he was arrested.
[time=2123] Two times he was put in prison and two times he escaped.
[time=2127] Having escaped from prison a second time, John Dillinger hid out in Wisconsin.
[time=2133] The police surrounded him.
[time=2135] They had him hemmed in and by himself.
[time=2138] And by himself, Dillinger shot his way out killing two police officers and escaped again.
[time=2144] But he was later betrayed by a lady friend and was shot in a battle with the FBI.
[time=2151] You can't outrun the long arm of the law.
[time=2156] The book of Jonah teaches us in a parallel lesson that you cannot outrun the long arm of the Lord.
[time=2165] If you'd like to take your notes that are out inside the bulletin, we've put a little outline together to help you get an overview of Jonah.
[time=2172] Before we get to the study of chapter one today, let me give you the big picture.
[time=2178] Jonah was a Hebrew prophet living in the land of Israel.
[time=2183] God called him to go north and east to the city of Nineveh, the principal city of the world power Assyria.
[time=2192] This all took place in the eighth century B.C.
[time=2196] In Jonah chapter one, which we have just read, we find Jonah pursued.
[time=2202] God's called him and he is now a man on the run.
[time=2206] He was David Janssen, the fugitive of 2000 years ago.
[time=2213] And chapter one is Jonah pursued, or it might be subtitled, Jonah running away from God.
[time=2221] Chapter one ends with Jonah being swallowed by a great fish.
[time=2225] And it's so surprised that chapter two is Jonah praying.
[time=2230] We might subtitle that one, Jonah running to God.
[time=2236] God hears his prayer and miraculously he is, for lack of a more polite term, regurgitated back up on the shore.
[time=2244] His clothes half-digested, seaweed hanging from his ear and bound for Nineveh.
[time=2251] Chapter three, we find him preaching.
[time=2254] He is now running with God.
[time=2257] And in chapter four, he is disappointed.
[time=2259] He didn't like the way things turned out, and we find Jonah pouting.
[time=2263] He's running against God.
[time=2266] In chapter one, for our study today, I'd like to title this.
[time=2271] You can run, but you can't hide.
[time=2274] You cannot outrun the long arm of the Lord.
[time=2279] Let me give you three sections of chapter one.
[time=2282] Verses one and two constitute Jonah's call.
[time=2287] Verses three and four constitute Jonah's disobedience.
[time=2293] And chapter one verses five through seventeen constitute Jonah's consequences.
[time=2300] Jonah was called by the Lord to go to Nineveh.
[time=2304] Nineveh was perhaps the principal city of the Middle East in that time.
[time=2310] It was an exceedingly wicked city.
[time=2312] It was filled with people who were violent, who were ungodly, and who were immoral.
[time=2320] Jonah is called to go to that land and to preach a simple one-word message, a repent.
[time=2329] Jonah begins to think about his responsibilities, and he begins to think about the people, and he decides he doesn't like God's call.
[time=2338] And so he becomes disobedient.
[time=2341] And in verses three and four, we find Jonah running.
[time=2348] Let me sketch a world map for you very quickly.
[time=2351] Jonah's living here in Israel, and God says, " Jonah, I want you to go north and east to Assyria."
[time=2357] And Jonah says, "Right Lord, Nineveh in Assyria, northeast." He takes off walking, and he heads west.
[time=2366] Comes through the city of Japa, and he's now in the Mediterranean Sea, and he finds a ship heading for Tarsish, which is all the way at the other end of the Mediterranean Sea, past the Straits of Gibraltar in the land that we now call Portugal.
[time=2380] In other words, Jonah ran to the edge of the earth as he knew it.
[time=2384] If he knew there was a Fort Wayne, Indiana, I'm sure he'd have checked in at the downtown Hilton.
[time=2389] But as far as he knew, this was the edge of the earth, and it was as far as he could get from God, and where God wanted him to be.
[time=2397] He was a man on the run, trying to hide from God.
[time=2405] Why was it Jonah didn't want to go to Nineveh?
[time=2408] We can only speculate and think through what might be in his mind, but scholars have suggested these three reasons.
[time=2415] One, the difficulty of the situation.
[time=2418] Just to get from Israel, to Nineveh would be a journey of a month or more,
[time=2425] of walking through mountains and then through deserts.
[time=2429] It wasn't an enviable task.
[time=2433] More than that, when he got there, he would be approaching a city,
[time=2439] according to archaeologists of our day, that was surrounded by a wall 100 feet high.
[time=2446] For those of you here in the building, you can't tell this by way of television, it's three times the distance from here to our ceiling.
[time=2455] There are only a half a dozen buildings in Fort Wayne that would be over 100 feet tall.
[time=2460] And this 100-foot wall was a mere 50 feet thick.
[time=2467] And inside were the most violent, hostile people in the world.
[time=2473] Jonah looked at the task and he said, "I'm supposed to walk all the way to Nineveh, walk up to a gate at a 100-foot wall, knock on the door and say, "Hi, I'm a Hebrew prophet from way down Yonder, and I just dropped by to suggest you all might like to repent."
[time=2487] Would you like that job?
[time=2491] Not only was it a difficult assignment, it would be a very dangerous assignment.
[time=2497] You see, the Assyrians were violent people.
[time=2502] When they conquered a land and moved out, they had several plans to keep that nation in submission.
[time=2510] They taxed them enough to keep them absolutely impoverished. They deported and repopulated other regions of their empire
[time=2518] so that they educated. The intelligence and the leadership was extracted out of the land.
[time=2524] And then of all the common people left behind, they took the men of fighting age and they gouged out their right eye.
[time=2533] You see, when you went into combat in those days, you carried your shield in your left hand and your sword in your right hand.
[time=2539] And you peaked out to fight the enemy with your right eye.
[time=2545] And if you didn't have a right eye, you had to extend your whole head and expose it.
[time=2550] And you saw the enemy, but not for long.
[time=2554] Not only did they gouge out their right eye, they would take the men and the horses and they would cut the back of their leg
[time=2562] to ruin what we call the hamstring muscle so that the horses and the men were incapable of military combat.
[time=2570] Now, knowing what kind people these Assyrians are, how would you like to show up in your foreign Hebrew attire
[time=2578] and say, "The Lord God of Israel sent me by myself."
[time=2584] To tell hundreds of thousands of you to repent.
[time=2588] Jonah could picture himself being sent home in one hour missing body parts.
[time=2594] It was a dangerous assignment, one he was more than willing to pass.
