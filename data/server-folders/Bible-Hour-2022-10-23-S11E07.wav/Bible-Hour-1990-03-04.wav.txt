[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Prayer is becoming a matter of pride and pretentiousness.
[time=79] One man said to his friend, "You don't know much about prayer.
[time=83] Sure, I do," he responded.
[time=85] Well, if you know so much about prayer, let me hear you give us the Lord's Prayer.
[time=89] The fellow thought for a moment, and he said, "Now I lay me down to sleep.
[time=94] I pray the Lord my soul to keep." The fellow said, "Why, you surprised me.
[time=99] You do know the Lord's Prayer." (music playing) - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=118] Thank you for joining us.
[time=120] Rick's message today is entitled, "Man Overboard." Today's message deals with pure, unpretentious prayer.
[time=128] Over the centuries, Christians have made prayer complicated and cumbersome.
[time=132] Guilt is often laid on believers for not praying at the right time, with the right words, or long enough.
[time=139] God didn't tell us to pray to make us feel guilty, but to make us grow, grow closer to Him.
[time=145] In today's message, Rick will first look at the problem about Jonah and the whale, and then the prayer from Jonah in the whale.
[time=153] Without using guilt, we hope to make your prayer life more meaningful.
[time=158] Please find your Bible and open it to the book of Jonah, Chapter 2.
[time=162] Our special music today includes a song from celebration and a solo from Kathy Hawks.
[time=171] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "The Majesty and Glory of Your Name." [MUSIC] When I gaze into the night sky [MUSIC] I sense the words of Your fingers [MUSIC] The mood and stars are stranded in space [MUSIC] On His side [MUSIC] God is glad that You are mindful of Him [MUSIC] You have given me the proud of glory and honor [MUSIC] And have made Him a little older than the angels [MUSIC] You have put Him in charge of our creation [MUSIC] The peace of the field [MUSIC] And the words of the earth [MUSIC] The peace of the sea [MUSIC] And God is glad [MUSIC] God is red [MUSIC] Oh, one is red [MUSIC] That You are mindful of Him [MUSIC] Oh Lord, our love [MUSIC] The Majesty and Glory of Your Name [MUSIC] Tense and dear earth [MUSIC] And here's our heavens [MUSIC] Oh Lord, our love [MUSIC] Oh little children [MUSIC] Praise You perfectly [MUSIC] And so would we [MUSIC] And so would we [MUSIC] Are you young?

[time=459] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=526] This time celebration is going to come and present a special number for us.
[time=531] [MUSIC] There was a time when I would fret [MUSIC] About the time that lies ahead [MUSIC] Until the time my Savior said [MUSIC] You are mine [MUSIC] Never for me [MUSIC] And so [MUSIC] Why should I worry if it shines or rains [MUSIC] I'm safe and warm [MUSIC] Under His wings [MUSIC] I'm in no hurry for an earthly ping [MUSIC] I'm forever in God's game [MUSIC] Troubles come and troubles go [MUSIC] I can't change I think [MUSIC] My worry is so [MUSIC] Kissing goodbye to all my worldly walls [MUSIC] I'm forever in God's game [MUSIC] We rock the metal with flowers bright [MUSIC] This is the sparrow far [MUSIC] And though He leads me through the darkest night [MUSIC] I'm sheltered in His wings [MUSIC] Protected through it all so [MUSIC] Why should I worry if it shines or rains [MUSIC] I'm forever in God's game [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] Why should I worry if it shines or rains [MUSIC] I'm safe and [MUSIC] Under His wings [MUSIC] I'm in no hurry for an earthly ping [MUSIC] I'm sure in no hurry for an earthly ping I [MUSIC] Forever in God's [MUSIC] Forever, forever, forever in God's game [MUSIC] Remembering so well the day I met you [MUSIC] Lord, you placed me in your arms and sin [MUSIC] I forgive you from the fear of what would be [MUSIC] You came and rescued me [MUSIC] Lord, I prayed today for the rest [MUSIC] Of my life, live inside my heart [MUSIC] Please stay for all praise [MUSIC] Till the timeless place [MUSIC] When we're face to face [MUSIC] And we embrace [MUSIC] For long [MUSIC] Look ahead and see the things [MUSIC] I must fly [MUSIC] Some high and some low [MUSIC] But if you leave I'll go [MUSIC] And at the end I'll see [MUSIC] You were always there with me [MUSIC] Lord, I prayed today for the rest [MUSIC] Of my life, live inside my heart [MUSIC] Please stay for always [MUSIC] Till the timeless place [MUSIC] When we're face to face [MUSIC] And we embrace [MUSIC] It's for always [MUSIC] Lord, I prayed today for the rest [MUSIC] Of my life, live inside my heart [MUSIC] Please stay for always [MUSIC] Till that timeless place [MUSIC] When we're face to face [MUSIC] And we embrace [MUSIC] It's for always [MUSIC] Oh [MUSIC] Lord, your word says â™ª
[time=1249] Our Father, we thank you for the confidence of your word, that it says always.
[time=1255] And it's our heart's desire today that there would be those who would pray with Kathy's son, that they would open up their heart and ask you to come in and to stay forever and for always.
[time=1268] Thank you for the prospect that as ours, that someday we shall behold him face to face
[time=1275] the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb of Glory.
[time=1279] Oh, we love you, Lord, and we've come to worship you.
[time=1282] We thank you today that you've promised to uniquely meet with us, that as we've gathered in your name, you would be present.
[time=1290] And so today we ask you to make your word come alive, make it more than history, make it more than lessons, make it life, give it power.
[time=1302] Help us today to taste and see that the Lord is good.
[time=1306] We ask for strength today for those who are going through the hard times and feel as though life is about to throw them overboard.
[time=1316] We would pray today for Tim and Connie Teder, as they have now the pain and the struggle of dealing with a handicapped child.
[time=1326] We would ask you to comfort them and to give them surety in the days ahead.
[time=1331] We pray today for those who have lost loved ones, for Tim Kaiser, Terry Anderson, Sandy Jessup.
[time=1339] We pray for those today who are battling for their health and even their lives, for Jesus Gonzalez, Maria Gardner's father.
[time=1349] We thank you today for those who have been able to go home from the hospitals, like Pam Chilcote.
[time=1356] Yet God, the needs of an audience like this would be more numerous than one mind can know.
[time=1363] But we ask that your mind is infinite and you know every need.
[time=1367] We ask you to be the God of all comfort, to give stability to those who have been thrown overboard in life.
[time=1374] And now as we open up your word, we ask you to feed us.
[time=1378] To teach us.
[time=1380] To direct our lives.
[time=1382] In Christ's name.
[time=1384] [AMEN] Over the centuries, Christianity and the subject of prayer has become one of pride and pretense.
[time=1394] Who can pray the loudest? Who can pray the longest?
[time=1397] Who can pray with the longest string of adjectives that nobody else in the room understands?
[time=1403] We forget that prayer is simply talking to God, it's not trying to impress the audience around us.
[time=1409] Two good old boys were arguing with each other who knew the most about prayer.
[time=1414] The one said, "You don't know that much about prayer.
[time=1417] Matter of fact, you don't even know the Lord's prayer." The other old boy says, "I do too." He said, "All right, if you know the Lord's prayer, let's hear it." And I had to scratch and think for a little bit, but he finally came up with something.
[time=1429] He said, "Lord's prayer goes like this.
[time=1432] Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep." The other old boy said, "Well, I'm sorry. You do know more about prayer than I thought you did."
[time=1442] I don't expect today to teach you everything there is to know about prayer, but there is a prayer in the Bible that gives us some simple take-home principles to make prayer fresh and relevant and most of all unpretentious.
[time=1456] If you have a Bible, open it please to the book of Jonah and the second chapter, and Jonah chapter 2 is really Jonah's prayer.
[time=1463] If you know the story, Jonah was thrown overboard, swallowed by a great fish and on his way down uttered a quick prayer.
[time=1472] Later in life, Jonah recorded his biography in this four chapter book in chapter 2 as a reflection of how we prayed to the Lord then and later.
[time=1482] He called me to read Jonah chapter 2 for you.
[time=1486] From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.
[time=1491] He said, "In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
[time=1498] From the depths of the grave I called for help, and you listened to my cry.
[time=1507] You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me.
[time=1516] All your waves and breakers swept over me." I said, "I have been banished from your sight, yet I will again look toward your holy temple.
[time=1530] The engulfing waters threatened me. The deep surrounded me as seaweed was wrapped about my head.
[time=1538] To the roots of the mountains I sank down, the earth beneath barred me in forever.
[time=1547] But you brought my life up from the pit, O Lord my God, when my life was ebbing away.
[time=1556] I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to your holy temple.
[time=1561] Those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs.
[time=1566] But I, with a song of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you.
[time=1571] What I have vowed, I will make good. Salvation comes from the Lord.
[time=1578] And the Lord commanded the fish and it vomited Jonah unto the dry land.
[time=1584] Well, in this passage today I want to center our thoughts on two separate topics.
[time=1589] The first topic would be the problems about Jonah and the whale, and then the second would be the prayer of Jonah from the whale.
[time=1597] There are those who are skeptical, some downright critical, about the miraculous nature of biblical accounts,
[time=1608] and chiefly this one of Jonah and the whale.
[time=1612] In fact, in a famous trial in Chicago, where two men by the name of Leopold and Leub were on trial, Clarence Darryl, who was famous for his role in the Scopes Monkey Trail case, attacked the prosecutor saying that the evidence that the state offered against these two men
[time=1632] was no more believable than Jonah and the whale.
[time=1636] And from that very day till now, any time you find something absolutely incredible, you say that's no more believable than Jonah and the whale.
[time=1645] It's a fair question.
[time=1647] Many today could go to a school that would be prone to teach the Bible, and there you might be taught in a seminary or a Bible college that Jonah and the whale is only a story.
[time=1658] It never happened. It was only a fable met to teach another lesson.
[time=1664] Is that what we believe?
[time=1667] Do we believe that there was no Jonah?
[time=1669] There was no whale. There was no whale swallowing Jonah.
[time=1672] There was no Jonah getting vomited out by the whale.
[time=1674] It's just a fable.
[time=1677] I believe that it's history.
[time=1679] I believe that Jonah was actually swallowed by the whale.
[time=1683] Now, doubters would raise three problems.
[time=1686] Problem number one is that some say that whales can't swallow a man whole.
[time=1695] It's physiologically impossible.
[time=1697] A second problem is this.
[time=1699] Whales don't inhabit the Mediterranean Sea.
[time=1703] The third problem is this.
[time=1705] If there was a whale in the Mediterranean Sea who could swallow a man, the man couldn't survive for 72 hours.
[time=1712] I'd like to share with you five lines of reasoning to support the historicity of this book.
[time=1720] But after we go through all five sources of evidence, it will still require faith that you believe that Jonah was swallowed by the whale.
[time=1729] I cannot prove that today and no one can prove it.
[time=1733] But what we can do is offer evidence to support you having the faith to believe it.
[time=1742] Faith is not a blind step or leap into the dark.
[time=1748] Faith is an informed intelligence step into the light.
[time=1753] It is a step that says I've examined the evidence and based upon what I know I can conclude one step further in faith.
[time=1762] Faith is not what a little boy said in his third grade Sunday school room.
[time=1766] The teacher said, "Boys and girls, what's faith?" Nobody had answered.
[time=1771] Well, surely somebody knows what faith the teacher said, and finally this little guy raises his hand kind of apathetic lane.
[time=1777] The teacher calls on him and says, "Well, what's faith?" He says, "Faith is believing something that you just know ain't so." That's not faith.
[time=1786] Faith is not saying, "I'm going to take all of my intelligence and I'm going to put it in the shelf and I'm going to leave it there.
[time=1792] I'm going to go to church and swallow whatever fish story they tell me and I'm going to come home and then I'll pick up my intelligence again." Faith is examining the evidence and then making a conclusion.
[time=1805] Let me give you five pieces of evidence.
[time=1807] Source of evidence number one is language.
[time=1810] I think there are two grammatical insights we need to make that will clear up some of this.
[time=1815] The Bible never said that Jonah was swallowed by a whale.
[time=1822] The Old Testament word found in the book of Jonah
[time=1829] should be translated "great fish." The New Testament word, a Greek word that Jesus used means "sea monster."
[time=1840] So we're not at all obliged to come up with the exact species of whale that swallowed Jonah.
[time=1847] It could have been something other than a whale.
[time=1849] It could have been a sea monster.
[time=1851] It could have been a great shark.
[time=1855] It could have been any numbers of aquatic species.
[time=1859] So it doesn't have to be a certain genus of whale.
[time=1863] Second grammatical insight we need to make is this one.
[time=1867] When the Bible says three days and three nights, that is called a figure of speech or an idiom, not an idiot, an idiom.
[time=1877] And when we say three days and three nights, we are not obliging ourselves that it is exactly 72 hours that Jonah was in the belly of the fish.
[time=1888] By that, we mean that part of one day, all of the next day, and then part of the third day.
[time=1894] It could have been 72 hours, but it may have been something less than that just spanning three different days.
[time=1900] Let me give you an illustration.
[time=1902] Suppose you went on a fun family trip and you went to a nice city like Chicago and you checked into the holiday inn at seven o'clock at night and you said you wanted to stay until one day.
[time=1914] And so you went and you saw the museum, you went on top of the series tower, you came back, you swam in the pool, you packed up your bags and at seven o'clock the next night, you went to check out.
[time=1926] How many days are they going to charge you for?
[time=1928] Two.
[time=1931] You see, those are just figures of speech.
[time=1934] When you say I want to stay one day at a hotel, you probably can't check in before two and you're probably going to have to check out before noon.
[time=1940] They don't give you 24 hours.
[time=1942] If you've ever rented a car in a major city where cars are at a premium, the show up just an hour late and see if they say no problem, really wasn't a day.
[time=1952] They'll charge you.
[time=1954] That's just business.
[time=1956] It's just a figure of speech that we say a day and we don't mean exactly 24 hours.
[time=1962] So when Jesus was in the grave three days and three nights, we only mean that he was in there part of Friday, all of Saturday, and just enough to get rest on Sunday because he had to get up first thing in the morning.
[time=1975] Jonah was not necessarily 72 hours in the belly of the fish.
[time=1979] He was there part of one day all of the next and we don't know how much of the third.
[time=1985] So we still have a problem that Jonah was swallowed by a great fish and was in there more than 24 hours and could he survive it.
[time=1995] It's turned to the next piece of evidence, science, we'll leave language behind.
[time=2000] I'd like to quote extensively from the writings of a man by the name of Gableine, his book on the minor prophets.
[time=2007] He says, "A generation ago, one heard that a whale could not swallow Jonah simply because
[time=2014] the throat of the whale is too small.
[time=2017] A whale has difficulty swallowing an orange was the viewpoint.
[time=2022] This objection rose from a failure to distinguish between the Greenland whale which does not have a very sizable throat and the whale that was best known to semen of that generation."
[time=2036] What Gableine is saying is that when criticism about Jonah and the whale came up at the end of the 1800s,
[time=2042] most scholars were only aware of the whale that's called the Greenland whale,
[time=2048] which does have a very small throat and even God would have had a hard time squeezing Jonah through it.
[time=2054] Could have done it, but it doesn't make much sense.
[time=2058] But since those critics arose, we've now discovered that there are not a few but dozens of species of whales.
[time=2066] One in particular is the sperm whale that has a mouth that is often 20 feet wide, 15 feet high
[time=2077] and could swallow something the size of your living room.
[time=2083] In fact, there has been on exhibition in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.
[time=2092] a blackfish weighing 1500 pounds that was swallowed whole by a sperm whale.
[time=2100] So we no longer have a scientific impossibility of a whale swallowing a man whole.
[time=2107] Furthermore, it didn't even have to be a whale.
[time=2110] There is a species of animal called the rhinodon or whale shark.
[time=2115] It is the largest of all fish in the sea, 50 to 70 feet in length.
[time=2122] Thor Heyerdahl in his famous work, Contiki, tells the story of being followed by a whale shark,
[time=2129] the rhinodon, for several days.
[time=2132] His description of it is almost humorous.
[time=2136] Here's what he said.
[time=2138] It was the head of a variable sea monster, broad and flat like a frog, with two small eyes right at the sides and a toad-like jaw that was four to five feet wide
[time=2150] and had long fringes drooping down from the corners of the mouth.
[time=2154] Behind the head was an enormous body ending in a long tail fin which stood straight up.
[time=2160] The monster was a whale shark, the largest fish known in the world today.
[time=2169] Furthermore, this rhinodon is a shark without teeth.
[time=2176] It is not carnivorous, it sucks in plankton to digest it.
[time=2183] So now we have another species along with the sperm whale.
[time=2187] And science could afford us a half a dozen more species, totally capable of swallowing a man.
[time=2196] Allow me to move to a third source of evidence, and that is the source of history.
[time=2201] We need to ask the question, is there any historical evidence besides the Bible of Jonah and the whale?
[time=2209] Now within the general field of history, we turn specifically to archeology.
[time=2214] And the archeologists have unearthed an artifact from Egypt.
[time=2219] And this Egyptian artifact has the drawing of a giant sea monster of sorts,
[time=2226] approaching land and expelling a man out of its mouth.
[time=2230] Archeologists have dated this to somewhere between the fifth and sixth century B.C.
[time=2237] We date Jonah at about the seventh century B.C.
[time=2241] So now we have not only a biblical account, but we have the collaboration of an totally unrelated population.
[time=2248] The Egyptians, identifying there was at least the belief historically that such an event occurred.
[time=2257] And now we turn to the next source of evidence, and that is experience.
[time=2264] Has this ever happened at any other time?
[time=2267] Has a man ever been swallowed by a whale and lived to tell about it?
[time=2272] Actually, there are at least two accounts that we know of.
[time=2275] One is the story that I shared with you some months back of a man by the name of James Bartlett,
[time=2281] who was on the whaling ship, the Star of the East.
[time=2284] Someone yelled from the port of the ship, "Thar she brows in a crew of men scampered to their harpoon boats,
[time=2291] and two harpoon boats went out chasing the whales.
[time=2295] One harpoon launched its harpoon, struck the whale, and in its fight to get away,
[time=2301] it caused a mini tidal wave and capsized one of the harpooning boats, and James Bartlett was washed out the sea.
[time=2309] In the search, they could not find him.
[time=2312] Later, they harpooned a second whale, drew it to the ship, the Star of the East, took all the rubber off of it, stored it in its hall, and then hoisted the carcass of the dead whale on the ship and noticed some movement in the stomach area.
[time=2327] They got a knife, cut the stomach open, and extracted one James Bartlett alive.
[time=2336] He wasn't there three days, but he was swallowed by a whale and lived to tell about it.
[time=2344] There was a second story of a man in the year 1758, a sailor, also fell overboard,
[time=2351] was seen to be swallowed by a shark.
[time=2354] The captain shot a gun at the fish, which cast the sailor out, and he was taken aboard alive.
[time=2361] The fish was harpooned and dried.
[time=2363] The sailor had the good fortune to be presented with the fish by the captain.
[time=2367] He toured Europe exhibiting the shark, which was 20 feet long, weighing 3,924 pounds.
[time=2374] Whatever one thinks of this story, it has one very significant feature, the monster swallowed a man, and he came back alive.
[time=2385] None of these things proved that Jonah was swallowed by a whale shark, a rhinodon, a sea monster,
[time=2393] or any other creature.
[time=2395] But the sum total of this says that it is logical, it is credible, and it is plausible to believe in the historicity of this story.
[time=2405] And as the final piece of evidence, I will only reiterate it from last week.
[time=2409] Theology offers this.
[time=2412] It depends on your definition of God.
[time=2414] If you've got the God of the deus, like Voltaire, then you have a watchmaker God.
[time=2420] You have a God who created the world like a man might create a watch.
[time=2424] And the God who winds up his world and through laws of nature causes it to tick along,
[time=2430] like a man would wind his watch.
[time=2432] And then the God of the deus sits down and becomes an absentee landlord, and forever lets his world tick by without his intervention.
[time=2442] If that's your view of God, then Jonah and the whale is absolutely incredible.
[time=2447] But if you have a God who creates, like a man creates a watch, if you have a God who likes to play with his world, like I like to play with my man.
[time=2457] This is a neat watch.
[time=2458] You can press this button and it says Sunday the 18th.
[time=2460] I press it again.
[time=2461] It says that it's 11-40 and you've got in Germany for 20 more minutes.
[time=2465] I can press it again and it says my alarm is going to go off at 6-15 tomorrow morning.
[time=2469] I press it again and there's a stop.
[time=2471] You know, I can play with this.
[time=2472] It's mine and I can use it.
[time=2474] And God says this world is his and he can intervene and he can press our buttons and he can take the laws of nature and put them into place, but then he can interrupt them and work a miracle like the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[time=2490] or the worldwide flood or Jonah and the whale.
[time=2497] Language, science, history, experience, and theology blend together
[time=2506] that Jonah and the whale is not just another fish story.
[time=2511] Let me change channels on you.
[time=2513] And now let's look more closely at Jonah's prayer that he prayed from the whale.
[time=2520] I believe there are three characteristics of his prayer that I need to incorporate into my praying
[time=2526] and I'm sure that it would help each of you.
[time=2529] First characteristic I see of his prayer is its simplicity.
[time=2536] I'd like to title it that he rejects spiritual gimmicks.
[time=2542] We've made prayer too complicated.
[time=2545] I remember praying one time at the dinner table and at the end of the prayer I said amen and my daughter Rebecca was appalled.
[time=2553] She said you can't do that.
[time=2555] She said you can't just say amen.
[time=2558] You have to say in Jesus name amen.
[time=2562] And to her little mind those were the magic words.
[time=2565] I mean if you didn't address the prayer at the end of it who knows where it would end up.
[time=2569] For some of us we think saying all the right words is what makes prayer have its power or its authority.
[time=2578] It's not true.
[time=2580] Most of the time we're guilty of praying not to the Lord but to each other.
[time=2584] We are just trying to impress each other with our words.
[time=2588] You know we bow our head and we say oh God you're omniscient, omnipresent, omnipresent, immutable.
[time=2594] We go through this long list of words.
[time=2596] We're not sure what they mean but it sure sounds good out there.
[time=2599] There was a movie Jim Pearson told me about I've got to rent it because I want to see this line.
[time=2603] This dad bows his head to pray and he knows God some of these omnis, something or others.
[time=2608] So he says God we know you're omnivorous.
[time=2611] If you didn't get that omnivorous means you eat everything.
[time=2615] I don't know that God's omnivorous.
[time=2617] I know he's omnipotent in his omniscient.
[time=2619] I've never heard it before he's omnivorous.
[time=2621] That guy just wanted to impress somebody out there.
[time=2624] I'm praying for the audience.
[time=2626] You ever get around brand new Christians who haven't been tampered with by the rest of us and just hear them talk or pray it's refreshing.
[time=2635] They do all kinds of things that we wouldn't do.
[time=2638] Back in my youth pastor days a young guy accepted Christ on a Sunday.
[time=2643] And on Monday he's already telling his friends about Christ.
[time=2646] No one had told him he weren't supposed to do that.
[time=2648] So he just went out and told people about Christ.
[time=2650] And several of his friends accepted Christ.
[time=2653] And the next Sunday morning we're having that time for people to share.
[time=2656] And he's going to share that he accepted Christ and some of his friends accepted Christ.
[time=2660] Now if he was well trained in coach Christians he would have said.
[time=2663] Praise the Lord.
[time=2665] Last week I gave my heart to Jesus.
[time=2668] I realized my total depravity and I succumbed to his irresistible grace.
[time=2674] And then out of his mercy he used a wretch like me.
[time=2678] As his instrument to draw these other two lost souls into eternal life.
[time=2683] Well see no one had gotten him all the theology yet.
[time=2685] So here's what he said.
[time=2687] He said I'm just thankful last week I got God.
[time=2690] And you know what this past week I've saved two of my friends.
[time=2694] You know you can see all these kids that grew up in Christian Homecoming.
[time=2697] You know you're not allowed to do that.
[time=2699] You can do that.
[time=2701] You don't have to have any formulas or right words.
[time=2704] And you don't have to say things just perfectly.
[time=2708] Chuck Swindall tells the story of when he was in seminary and Howard Hendricks was the teacher.
[time=2712] This guy was in a prayer meeting and he'd gotten saved and came to Christ two days before.
[time=2718] And they were praying around a circle and there's one, two, three.
[time=2721] He was the fourth guy.
[time=2723] And this guy knows it's now his turn to pray and he says I'm God.
[time=2728] It's me Rick.
[time=2729] You remember we met two days ago when I was on the corner of fourth and Maple Street.
[time=2734] And I was wearing loose.
[time=2737] You know and the guys he is talking to God.
[time=2739] No one told him yet that God was omniscient and he knew where he was two days ago.
[time=2744] Just talking to God.
[time=2746] Now how do I get that out of Jonah?
[time=2748] I get that out of Jonah because Jonah is going down.
[time=2752] He's looking at new places that national geographic has never been.
[time=2760] He's studying seaweed close up.
[time=2766] And he says I called to the Lord and he saved me.
[time=2770] It's like Peter.
[time=2771] Peter starts walking on the water.
[time=2774] And all of a sudden he realizes he's walking on the water and he starts the stink.
[time=2778] He didn't go oh great God of the universe.
[time=2781] The creator of heaven and earth.
[time=2783] Now who knows?
[time=2784] The water comes over.
[time=2786] He just said three words.
[time=2788] Lord save me.
[time=2795] Prayers that simple.
[time=2797] It's talking to God.
[time=2798] It's not pressing all the right buttons.
[time=2800] It's not being in the right place.
[time=2802] You know we put too much emphasis on being in the right place when you pray.
[time=2806] Jonah gives us a clue here.
[time=2808] On his way down in the belly of the fish or in the ocean we're not sure which.
[time=2814] He said I lifted up my eyes to your temple.
[time=2817] I don't think God's got any temple 20,000 leagues below the sea.
[time=2821] He was just saying God I was caught in prayer and I realized I'm always in your presence and I smoked one up quick.
[time=2829] Lord save me.
[time=2833] You know if it's convenient for you or if you can possibly work it in your schedule with a reasonable amount of sacrifice we want to invite you to our prayer meetings.
[time=2842] But if you can't come Thursday at six thirty or Wednesday at seven o'clock you know what?
[time=2846] God prays at other hours.
[time=2849] Go ahead and pray then.
[time=2851] You don't have to have the right words or be in the right places.
[time=2854] You just talk to God.
[time=2856] You drop all the spiritual gimmicks.
[time=2861] God is not impressed with how long or how often we pray.
[time=2865] D.L. Moody was just a character of a guy.
[time=2868] If I could have lived and heard anyone speak it I wanted it to be D.L. Moody.
[time=2872] He lived a hundred years ago.
[time=2874] He had a wit and a charm about him but he was just as rough and gruff as a guy could be
[time=2880] and he detested long prayers.
[time=2883] And right before he was the speak he's standing over there and this guy is praying and he's prayed through the book of Genesis.
[time=2888] Now he's praying in front of all these people.
[time=2892] Moody came over and steered him away and said while this brother finishes talking to the Lord we're going to have our meeting now.
[time=2899] And wouldn't you like to do that sometime?
[time=2903] It's like that scene in the movie Hoosiers where this diligent young guy is always talking to the Lord and during half of a time out he starts to praying and the coach finally came over and said the Lord wants you in the game now.
[time=2917] That prayer is just talking to God.
[time=2920] It's not magical words, it's not magical phrases.
[time=2923] Jesus said don't do that.
[time=2927] He said don't be like the pagans who think by their repetitions of phrases again and again
[time=2934] that God's now going to hear.
[time=2936] There was a classic battle between Elijah the prophet of God and all these phony prophets of Baal.
[time=2942] And each of them built an altar and each of them put a sacrifice on top of the altar and each of them left their matches at all.
[time=2949] And the challenge was to pray and have your God start the fire.
[time=2954] And so these prophets of Baal, they're over here and they're going through all their rigamarole and they're going oh Baal hear us.
[time=2961] Oh Baal hear us.
[time=2965] Going on for hours and hours and hours.
[time=2968] Oh Baal hear us.
[time=2969] Elijah was the original wise guy.
[time=2971] This is biblical.
[time=2972] You think I sneak all these things and this is true stuff.
[time=2975] Read it in first Kings after the message is over.
[time=2977] Not now.
[time=2978] But Elijah says maybe he's asleep.
[time=2980] Shout a little louder.
[time=2981] You'll make him.
[time=2984] Maybe he's out.
[time=2985] Give him a moment.
[time=2986] He'll be back.
[time=2988] Maybe he's hard of hearing.
[time=2989] Maybe you're God's and he ridicules these guys.
[time=2991] And for six hours they're going oh Baal hear us and nothing happens.
[time=2997] And Elijah at noon walks over and he says God demonstrate your power.
[time=3001] Boom.
[time=3002] Fire.
[time=3003] Instantly.
[time=3005] Just pray.
[time=3006] In the New Testament.
[time=3008] Paul comes and he preaches the Lord Jesus Christ in the city of Ephesus.
[time=3012] And people are turning to Christ wholesale.
[time=3016] And this guy named Demetrius used to make these little statues of Diana.
[time=3019] You know you put them on your fireplace.
[time=3021] Dash of your car.
[time=3022] Have one in your eye.
[time=3023] You know you pray to Diana all these times.
[time=3025] And business drops off.
[time=3026] Boom.
[time=3027] He's got his own personal depression.
[time=3029] Nobody's buying his idol so he starts a riot.
[time=3032] And for two hours the people stood in the street shawling.
[time=3036] Greatest Diana of Ephesus.
[time=3040] Raw, Raw, Diana.
[time=3041] Nothing's happening.
[time=3044] You don't have to give God two hours of repetitious praying for him to hear you.
[time=3048] You just simply talk to him.
[time=3050] I'm spending too much time.
[time=3051] Two more principles.
[time=3054] Second thing about Jonah's prayer life is this.
[time=3058] He recognized the sovereignty of God.
[time=3061] If you read chapter one, Jonah's on deck and it's the sailors on the ship that give him the old Heave Hall.
[time=3067] Nice knowing you Jonah.
[time=3070] Look at chapter two, verse three.
[time=3073] "You hurled me into the deep, into the very heart of the seas, and the current swirled
[time=3079] about me.
[time=3080] All your waves and breakers swept over me." Who Jonah saved through him in the sea?
[time=3086] The sailors?
[time=3087] That captain?
[time=3088] He said, "God, you." It was your sovereign hand.
[time=3092] Oh, maybe some men grabbed me, but you are the one that threw me into the sea.
[time=3098] This was no accident.
[time=3099] These weren't the laws of nature.
[time=3101] Those were your waves that pounded me to the bottom.
[time=3105] It was your undertow that sucked me down so that God was in control of every move that
[time=3112] was being made in his life.
[time=3114] It wasn't a group of seamen, but it was the sovereign God that threw him overboard.
[time=3119] This reminds us of the story of Joseph.
[time=3123] Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers.
[time=3127] Then he went from slavery down to prison, but he worked his way out of prison up the ladder and became the equivalent of the prime minister of Egypt.
[time=3137] Decades have gone by.
[time=3139] Now there's a famine in the land of Israel, and Joseph's brothers must go to Egypt to buy grain and now they stand before the prime minister, not recognizing him in his Egyptian
[time=3151] attire, and they plead for mercy that he would sell him grain.
[time=3155] Then Joseph reveals to them that he is their brother, that they betrayed.
[time=3161] He is their brother that they sold into slavery and now these men fear for their life.
[time=3167] They think Joseph is going to strike with vengeance, and Joseph said this, what you intended for evil, God intended for good.
[time=3181] Joseph and Jonah saw the sovereignty of God in the worst situations of their life.
[time=3190] Stephen Maria Gardner have sung, and I think Steve wrote it, a wonderful song,
[time=3196] thoroughly scriptural, called Nothing Can Happen To Me Today.
[time=3200] The words go like this, Nothing Can Happen To Me Today.
[time=3204] Nothing good, nothing bad, without passing through my father's hands.
[time=3210] Don't misunderstand the song or the scriptures.
[time=3213] It doesn't say nothing bad can happen to me today.
[time=3216] It says nothing good or nothing bad can happen that doesn't first go through the sovereign hands of God.
[time=3225] Something good may happen to you today, and it came from the hand of the Father.
[time=3229] And something tragic may hit your life.
[time=3232] You may be thrown overboard this week, but that too came through the sovereign hand of the Heavenly Father.
[time=3241] And here is a biblical principle that we need to learn while we're on the deck of the ship in calm seas.
[time=3247] Not a principle to learn when you're capsized.
[time=3251] It is Romans 8, 28.
[time=3253] All things work together for good.
[time=3257] For those who love God and are called according to His purpose.
[time=3262] There are two things you need to understand. It doesn't say all things are good.
[time=3266] It says all things eventually work out for good, but right now they may not be good.
[time=3272] But in eternity, God's going to use those to work out for good.
[time=3277] And the second thing that verse is only applied to those who are in God's will.
[time=3281] Those who are called according to His purpose.
[time=3284] It doesn't say go out and do whatever you want to do, and God's going to somehow oblige Himself to make it wonderful for you.
[time=3293] I say we need to learn that lesson now when the deck of our ship is stable.
[time=3298] Because when you lose your loved one, or you discover that your little child has Cornelia Delaying syndrome and will be severely limited.
[time=3308] Maybe having abbreviated life.
[time=3311] You already have to have your heart secured in the Lord.
[time=3315] You see, it's so hard to raise your sail or to drop your anchor in your storm.
[time=3320] Those are things you do in the straight waters of life.
[time=3324] Third principle we can get out of Jonas praying is his repentance of sin and guilt.
[time=3331] In verse 1 through 17 of chapter 1, he is a man on the run.
[time=3338] He is a man avoiding God.
[time=3340] God found him on the land, so he got on the sea.
[time=3343] God found him in the sea, so he got into the sea, and God found him in the sea.
[time=3348] And so after running from God again and again, finally he looks up the God, and in his prayer he says, "God, I surrender.
[time=3357] God, what I have vowed I will do."
[time=3363] Instead of running from God and rebelling against God, he now turns his life around and says, "What I have vowed I will do."
[time=3376] You know, as we go through prayer, I want to incorporate these three simple things into my praying.
[time=3383] I want to learn to drop that foreign language called Christianese, and I just want to pray in English.
[time=3391] Straight talk to God.
[time=3393] Not be hung up on the phrases or the places or who's listening and have them walk away saying, "Why, that was deep."
[time=3401] Just talk to God.
[time=3403] The second thing I want to do is I want to recognize God's sovereignty.
[time=3407] I want to see that he's taken care of everything before I ask for.
[time=3411] Instead of coming and saying, "God, here's my will.
[time=3414] Here's what my kingdom calls for.
[time=3416] I want to come and say, "God, you're sovereign, so I want your will, and I want your kingdom to come."
[time=3422] Thirdly, like the Lord taught us to pray, I want to pray with a spirit of repentance.
[time=3426] Saying, "God, forgive me. Forgive me my trespasses. Forgive me my debts, my daughter prays.
[time=3435] Forgive us our depthsters as we forgive those who depthster against us." Then you know what the Lord knows what she means?
[time=3442] "God, forgive me all the things I've done wrong. I repent and I come back to you."
[time=3448] David said it the way I like it best.
[time=3450] He created me a clean heart of God and renew a right spirit within me.
[time=3455] When we pray that prayer, then we find the fulfillment.
[time=3458] He restores to us the joy of our salvation.
