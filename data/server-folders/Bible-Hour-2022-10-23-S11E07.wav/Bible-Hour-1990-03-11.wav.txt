[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] After rising to the very top of the Ford Motor Company,
[time=101] Lee Iacolco was dumped, but he made a comeback with Chrysler.
[time=107] Mark Spitz in the 1972 Olympics won seven gold medals,
[time=113] and now he's thinking of a comeback in the 1992 Olympics.
[time=119] George Washington failed at two of his earliest military careers, but he made a comeback.
[time=126] Can a Christian ever fail and make a comeback?
[time=131] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=144] Thank you for joining us.
[time=145] Today on the Bible Hour, we will be talking about comebacks.
[time=149] Can a Christian who has failed God ever make a comeback?
[time=153] Will God ever use us?
[time=155] What must we do to be usable again?
[time=158] In the next half hour, we will discover four steps to making a spiritual comeback from the life of Jonah.
[time=165] Jonah disobeyed God and ran from his God-given calling, but he made a comeback.
[time=171] We invite you to study with us how to turn setbacks into comebacks.
[time=176] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us as Rick shares from the book of Jonah, chapter 3.
[time=183] Our special music today includes a song from Kevin Rowell and Rejoice.
[time=190] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "Beautiful Savior."
[time=201] [MUSIC] Beautiful Savior, King of creation [MUSIC] Son of God and Son of man [MUSIC] Truly I'd love thee [MUSIC] Truly I'd serve thee [MUSIC] Light of my soul [MUSIC] My joy, my crown [MUSIC]
[time=263] [MUSIC - 35 seconds]
[time=309] [MUSIC] Beautiful Savior [MUSIC] Lord of the nations [MUSIC] Son of God and Son of man [MUSIC] Glory and honor [MUSIC] Praise our salvation [MUSIC] God and glory, Lord [MUSIC] God and glory [MUSIC] And glory wide [MUSIC]
[time=373] [MUSIC]
[time=386] Let's continue our worship by turning to Him number 103.
[time=390] Him number 103, all praise to Him who reigns above.
[time=395] Blessed be His name.
[time=397] [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=482] Listen now as Kevin Rowe comes to sing for us.
[time=492] [MUSIC]
[time=502] Sometimes his eyes were gentle and filled with laughter.
[time=506] And sometimes they cry.
[time=510] Sometimes there was a fire of holy anger in Jesus' eyes.
[time=519] But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless, that saw through the fall to the knee, are the same eyes that looked down from heaven,
[time=535] and to the deepest part of you and me.
[time=540] And his eyes are always upon us.
[time=545] His eyes never close in sleep, and no matter where you go, you will always be in His eyes.
[time=560] [MUSIC]
[time=570] Sometimes his voice comes calling like rolling thunder, like driving rain.
[time=579] Sometimes his voice is quiet, and we start to wonder if he knows our name.
[time=589] But he who spoke peace to the water, cares more for our hearts than the waves.
[time=599] And the voice that once said, "You're forgiven." Still says, "You're forgiven today."
[time=612] Sometimes I look above me, and stars are shining, and I feel so small.
[time=623] How could the God of heaven and all creations, know I'm here at all?
[time=633] But then in the silence, my child I created you too.
[time=643] And you're my most precious creation.
[time=648] I even gave my son for you, and his eyes are always upon you.
[time=657] His eyes never close in sleep, and no matter where you go, you will always be in His eyes.
[time=674] No matter where you go, you will always be in His eyes.
[time=684] [MUSIC]
[time=703] It's my privilege to welcome you again to the Bible hour.
[time=707] We hope that God uses this 60 minutes in your life to draw you into a closer walk with our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=716] Today here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, we are on the verge of a mini-blizzard.
[time=720] We haven't had that much snow, but the wind is blowing, and it is frigidly cold, and it is a day when churches in the surrounding community have been forced to cancel, and we feel badly for our sister churches and other believers who can't worship today.
[time=736] Let me just ask you to support your church this week.
[time=740] I hope that by the time this broadcast airs here in Fort Wayne, it's warm and it's sunny once again, but please remember your local church.
[time=748] If you've been home shut in because of the weather and watching religious broadcasts like this one, we're thankful that you've been a part of our audience, but we want to encourage you to support your local church to get back to church as soon as you can and certainly to support it financially.
[time=763] Even though there was a Sunday mist, your church still needs your financial support.
[time=768] We hope you'll be faithful to your local church.
[time=771] Coming up here at Blackhawk and on the Bible hour is a special event with our friends, Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=778] Many of you who've been a part of the Bible hour over the years will know that they were formerly a part of our church.
[time=783] They've moved to California, and occasionally we have the privilege of them coming home and being with us here at Blackhawk.
[time=789] And Sunday morning, March the 18th, Steve and Maria Gardner will be back here back at Blackhawk as a part of the Bible hour.
[time=798] We want you to set that day to side and join us.
[time=801] Also, we are not too far away from the Easter season, and we've developed a good tradition of a good Friday service in the heart of our city at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=813] Believe it or not, good Friday this year is Friday the 13th.
[time=817] So if you're a Christian, you'll want to be worshiping the Lord because it's good Friday, and if you're superstitious, you probably want to find the right thing to do on Friday the 13th.
[time=827] Well, we'll have a service at 1215 to 1245 over the lunch hour
[time=833] on Good Friday.
[time=835] We want to invite you to come and join us at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=839] Today we are announcing that our school, Blackhawk Christian School, is beginning their registration.
[time=847] I, as a parent, am so thankful that my three children, Rachel, Rebecca, and Adam have the privilege of learning God's word and their entire spectrum of academic subjects here at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=862] Because it's a Christian school, we have two unique privileges.
[time=865] One, the Bible is a part of our curriculum, and two, the scriptures are integrated into related fields as we study.
[time=874] But please don't think that it is just a Sunday school.
[time=877] It's a truly accredited state school, and we have graduates going on to every possible level of academic pursuit.
[time=885] We have the privilege of training children with excellence in reading, writing, arithmetic, computers, and the whole spectrum of lower and higher education.
[time=896] And we have room for some new students in this next year.
[time=899] That's largely because we've begun a second first grade and a second second grade, and each year we'll be adding a grade.
[time=906] If you have an interest in your student, or perhaps your grandchildren attending a Christian school, I want to encourage you to call us this week, Monday through Friday, between eight and four, and ask for the school office.
[time=920] The phone number you'll need is, area code, 219-493-7400.
[time=927] That's 493-7400.
[time=932] Then today, before we go back to our morning worship service, we have an album recorded by our choir to share with you.
[time=939] In fact, we have it as a gift.
[time=942] If you would like a copy of this excellent first-rate album, you simply need to write to us, and we'll happily send you a copy.
[time=950] Our address is, the Bible Hour, 7400 East-State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=973] I know that this album will be a great opportunity for you to enjoy music, but also to find the time of personal reflection and worship.
[time=981] It's just excellent. It encourages my heart every time I listen to it.
[time=986] We want you to have a copy, so we hope you'll write today.
[time=990] Thank you again for joining us today here for the Bible Hour.
[time=993] If you don't have your Bible, please find it and find the book of Jonah and prepare to study with us today.
[time=999] Thank you again.
[time=1001] [MUSIC - 101 seconds]
[time=1107] Thank you, ladies.
[time=1113] Acts 4.12 says, "Neither is there salvation in any other name for there is no other name given amongst men whereby..."
[time=1121] "We must be saved." I want to ask you to now turn your eyes upon Jesus and listen to the Word of God as he gave it to the prophet Jonah.
[time=1133] Jonah chapter 3 verses 1 through 10.
[time=1137] Then the Word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.
[time=1141] Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.
[time=1147] Jonah obeyed the Word of the Lord and went to Nineveh.
[time=1151] Now Nineveh was a very important city, a visit required three days.
[time=1157] On the first day, Jonah started into the city.
[time=1161] He proclaimed, "40 more days in Nineveh will be overturned."
[time=1167] The Ninevites believed God.
[time=1170] They declared a fast and all of them from the greatest to the least put on sackcloth.
[time=1178] When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, took off his royal robes,
[time=1186] covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.
[time=1191] He issued a proclamation in Nineveh.
[time=1194] By the decree of the king and his nobles, do not let any man or beast, heard or flock, taste anything.
[time=1205] Do not let them eat or drink.
[time=1208] But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth.
[time=1212] Let everyone call urgently on God.
[time=1215] Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
[time=1219] Who knows, God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.
[time=1231] When the Lord saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion
[time=1237] and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.
[time=1242] Would you bow with me in prayer and again turn our eyes upon Jesus?
[time=1250] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1261] Talk for in his wonderful face.
[time=1272] In the light of his glory and grace.
[time=1301] Father, the care of this world seems so ominous.
[time=1306] An election in Nicaragua.
[time=1310] Drug crime in the streets of Fort Wayne.
[time=1314] The collapse of the American family.
[time=1317] The rebelliousness of children against parents.
[time=1323] Violence in our schools.
[time=1326] Hatred in the hearts of people because somebody has a different ethnic background.
[time=1331] A different religion or a different race.
[time=1335] The cares of this world are overwhelming.
[time=1339] And we now ask you to overshadow every one of these cares with the majesty and the glory of your name.
[time=1347] Nineveh was a city much like ours and you brought revival there.
[time=1353] Please Lord, bring revival here.
[time=1358] These people repented.
[time=1361] Bring repentance to our land.
[time=1364] Their king called for remorse and a turning away from violence and evil.
[time=1371] Give wisdom to our president, our congress and our cabinet.
[time=1375] To our local officials that they would enact legislation that their decrees would call people to godly living.
[time=1384] We ask you today Father to bring about a revival at the grassroots level.
[time=1390] That people would turn away from pornography.
[time=1396] That people would turn away from sexual promiscuity.
[time=1400] That people would turn away from drugs and alcohol.
[time=1404] Turn our eyes away from ourselves.
[time=1408] Please Lord, turn our eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1412] Help us today as we study your word to see Him, His hope and His love and His life.
[time=1418] Help us today to sense His forgiveness and our responsibility to be obedient.
[time=1425] When we look into His face, give us confidence today.
[time=1429] Please give confidence to Beth Kansen, to Karen Renner as they mourn the lost of loved ones.
[time=1435] Give confidence today to Tim and Connie Teder as they raise a little child with limitations.
[time=1441] Give confidence today to parents who are raising children alone through your word today.
[time=1448] Give us principles that take life's setbacks and turn them into comebacks.
[time=1454] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1459] It is inevitable in life that each of us will go through setbacks.
[time=1465] George Washington of Virginia at age 22 received the full rank of Colonel.
[time=1477] He was commissioned to take the army and move into the western lands of Virginia and there to drive out the French and the hostile Indians.
[time=1487] He pushed them from Fort Duquesne even 40 miles further away where he built his first fort and named it appropriately, Fort Necessity.
[time=1497] And there George Washington took a stand against the French and the Indian, a stand that was ill-fated.
[time=1507] British troops came to fortify the Americans but with them came no food and no supplies.
[time=1515] The French and the Indians surrounded the fort, shot and killed almost half of Washington's army and the Colonel had to surrender.
[time=1526] Half of his men were dead, the other half starving.
[time=1529] They marched back through the rain in the mud in utter defeat.
[time=1534] Washington saw another commission but was given none.
[time=1538] He then volunteered as an aide to General Braddock.
[time=1542] In his first campaign with Braddock, Braddock was killed, the army was defeated again and Washington came home after a second defeat, a second setback,
[time=1553] and was never again offered an opportunity to serve until the war with England.
[time=1563] In his setbacks turned around and became a comeback.
[time=1568] He took over a rag-cag army and defeated the most powerful army in the world and became the president of the United States.
[time=1576] But he began with a setback that turned around into a comeback.
[time=1582] Lee Iacoco was the golden boy of Ford Motor Company.
[time=1586] He joined the firm in 1946.
[time=1588] By 1960 he was Vice President and General Manager of the Sales Division of Ford Motor Company.
[time=1595] By 1965 he had fathered the most successful car in U.S. history, the Ford Mustang,
[time=1602] and was promoted to Vice President of the entire Ford corporate company.
[time=1609] And a few years later he was flatly canned.
[time=1614] He went through the biggest setback of his life.
[time=1617] In 1980 he took over a company that was going through the biggest setback of its life, Chrysler.
[time=1623] It was a mere one and one half billion dollars in debt.
[time=1631] Not millions, billions of dollars in debt.
[time=1638] They borrowed the money from each of us in the form of the United States government.
[time=1644] And by 1983, just three years later, Lee Iacoco called a news conference to announce that on that day,
[time=1651] Chrysler was paying back the last dollar plus interest that had borrowed from the United States of America.
[time=1659] A man had gone through a setback and turned it into a comeback.
[time=1664] In 1968, Mark Spitz was a high school senior and he was touted the greatest athlete to go to Mexico City.
[time=1672] Great things were expected of him.
[time=1674] They expected Mark Spitz to bring home a lot of gold.
[time=1677] He brought home none.
[time=1680] A bronze and a silver were the best he could do in individual performance.
[time=1686] He came home, defeated, discouraged and set back.
[time=1693] Four years later he swam in Munich.
[time=1698] He won the 100 meter freestyle.
[time=1701] He took gold in the 200 meter freestyle.
[time=1704] He won and set a world's record in the 100 meter butterfly and the 200 meter butterfly.
[time=1709] He swam the butterfly leg on the world record setting 400 medley relay.
[time=1714] And United States had its fastest swimmer in Mark Spitz on the 400 free relay and the 800 free relay.
[time=1724] And he came home with seven gold medals across his chest.
[time=1729] His setback had turned around into a comeback.
[time=1734] And now, at the age of 40, Mark Spitz is training again for a comeback in the 1992 Olympics.
[time=1745] He will be 42 years older than most of the fathers of the other swimmers that will be against him.
[time=1754] But he's going to try to come back.
[time=1757] Have you ever failed miserably in life and thought, "I'm done.
[time=1762] I'm washed up. I've blown my chance." Or God's the God of the second chance.
[time=1770] If you have your Bible open to Jonah chapter three, if you don't learn anything today, would you learn this one statement out of Jonah chapter three verse one?
[time=1782] Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.
[time=1789] Jonah had failed, and he had failed miserably, but his was not just failure of performance.
[time=1795] His was a failure of the will.
[time=1798] It's not that he tried and failed. He refused to try.
[time=1802] God said, " Jonah, I want you to be my prophet.
[time=1806] I want you to be my prophet to the land of Nineveh." And Jonah said, "God, I don't want to be your prophet.
[time=1811] And if I was going to be your prophet, I don't want to be a prophet to Nineveh." God said, "Had north and east," and Jonah said, "Fine," and had it south and west.
[time=1820] Caught passage on a boat to Tarsish, the furthest point on the globe of which he knew.
[time=1827] Jonah not only failed, but he failed to even try.
[time=1833] He was a man who was set back, and God gave him a second chance.
[time=1843] Does God give second chances? Yes, he does, and no, he does not.
[time=1851] Yes, God gives us a second chance if we failed him to come back and be used by him again.
[time=1859] No, God does not give us a second chance.
[time=1862] If you reject Jesus Christ, God's Son as your Savior, and you die, there is no second chance.
[time=1871] Some have erroneously thought that God will give me a second chance.
[time=1875] If I live my life, reject Christ, and I die just before God judges me, he'll give me a one final chance.
[time=1885] That is not true.
[time=1887] The Bible says it is a point of the man wants to die, and then the judgment.
[time=1893] There are no second chances after death, but today, if you have failed as a father, God will give you a second chance.
[time=1903] If you have failed as a witness for Christ, God will give you a second chance.
[time=1908] If you have failed to be a godly mother, there are steps you can take to have a second chance.
[time=1915] You can't roll back time like it was the calendar on your watch, but there are four steps that you can take to turn your setback into a comeback.
[time=1928] Step number one is this one.
[time=1930] You must assume the consequences.
[time=1935] You must assume the consequences for your mistake.
[time=1940] Flip back one page to Jonah chapter one.
[time=1945] In this flight from God, Jonah is on the boat, he's in the Mediterranean Sea, God sends up a storm, and it's bouncing that boat around like it was a toy.
[time=1956] The men of the ship and the captain have a confrontation with Jonah and Jonah confesses that he is running away from God.
[time=1965] And notice chapter one verses 11 and 12.
[time=1969] The sea was getting rougher and rougher, so they asked him, "What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?"
[time=1980] Jonah replied, "Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied, "and it will become calm.
[time=1988] I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come on you.
[time=2003] Jonah was given a second chance because he took this first step towards a comeback, and that was he assumed the consequences of his mistake.
[time=2017] As human beings, one of the hardest things for us to do is to assume the consequences of our mistake.
[time=2026] Our human nature says, "Excuse it. Minimize it. Justify it." Everybody else is living together. God, this is the 1990s. It's excusable.
[time=2036] Everyone else does it.
[time=2038] Everyone else puts in a lower quality than the specs call for. That's how you make your money. Everybody else does it.
[time=2047] Everybody else, before they sell their used car, rolls back the odometer a little bit, everybody else does that.
[time=2054] Everybody pads their expense account a little bit. That's one of the perks of the industry. Everybody does it.
[time=2062] Everybody exaggerates the benefits of their product. That's how you make yourself. Everybody does it.
[time=2071] That's human nature. To excuse our failures rather than to assume the consequences by justifying it, rationalizing it, minimizing it.
[time=2085] We bought a new game. It's a fun one to play. It's called Scatogories. What it does is you get this card that has 12 different categories, and then you roll a cube, and maybe it'll turn up the letter M.
[time=2096] Then you've got to think of a word for each of these categories that begins with M. So we're playing this game, Kathy and Steven Renee long raking myself.
[time=2105] We roll the cube and we're playing this game, and one of the categories says, "Excuses for being late." I couldn't think of any.
[time=2113] Kathy and Renee came up with some real lousy ones. Steve Long breaks the principle of our school. He had 25. He said, "I hear them all every morning.
[time=2122] I show up for work at 8.30. One kid comes in, gives his excuse. Another one comes in, gives his excuse. It's just a world full of excuses."
[time=2130] One teacher had four boys in her typing class. They came to first period class late and announced that they were real sorry, but they had had a flat tire.
[time=2137] She said, "That's fine. You sit there, you sit there, you over there, and you in that corner. Take out a piece of paper and draw a car. Put four tires on the car."
[time=2146] Now, circle the tire was flat.
[time=2153] Excuses. We're great of them as human beings. We can make up the best of them, but is it valid? God says, "If you want to turn your life around, you've got to stop making excuses and assume responsibility for the consequences."
[time=2170] Okay. I publicly want to confess one sin right now before my wife confesses it to everybody for me.
[time=2177] Now, just as I look, I saw a close friend who's a police officer. Two weeks ago, I got a speeding ticket.
[time=2184] Now, let me tell you what my human mind did. We're driving along at 55 miles an hour in a 55 mile an hour zone, but the speedometer in our car doesn't work exactly right.
[time=2196] So the officer said I was going 60, and then he pointed out that it was a 45 mile an hour zone that I just came through.
[time=2205] Now, my human mind does this. Speedometer doesn't work. It was a speed trap.
[time=2210] You know, they let it be 55 miles an hour and then drop it to 45 just to catch you.
[time=2214] And then as soon as the officer came up with the car, I was ready to say, three other people passed me.
[time=2219] I was just doing what everybody else did. Those are all three excuses. Speedometer doesn't work.
[time=2225] It's a speed trap. Everybody else is going that fast. Now, the truth of the story is.
[time=2231] Our speedometer doesn't work, but it registers slow, not fast.
[time=2237] Truth number two, it was through Warsaw, Indiana, where I lived for two years. I knew it was a 45 mile an hour zone.
[time=2243] Truth of the matter is, two people did pass me as I was passing seven others. I was wrong.
[time=2249] Human nature is to say, everybody else is doing it. It's okay. The system is bad. It's not my fault.
[time=2258] And as long as you're going to look at your life and say, it's not my fault that I failed.
[time=2263] It's not my fault that I've been caught. It's not my fault that I'm going to set back. You're going to stay set back.
[time=2270] The first thing you must do is what Jonah did and say, this is my fault.
[time=2278] You'll never be an overcomer if you don't assume the responsibility for your life, for its successes, and its failures.
[time=2288] And as soon as you point one finger out to blame somebody else, there are three pointing back to you.
[time=2295] And that's the way it should be. We've got some setbacks. Failed as a mom, as a dad. Failed as a husband, as a wife.
[time=2305] Just neglected those responsibilities. Admit it. And that's the first step.
[time=2312] And assume the consequences. Jonas consequences were that instead of being 550 miles an hour or 550 miles from God on dry land,
[time=2325] he was about 700 miles from God in the belly of a fish. And he couldn't blame that on the sea.
[time=2332] He couldn't blame it on the guys who threw him overboard. He couldn't blame it on the whale. He had to accept the consequences.
[time=2339] And he did. Step number two is this. You want to turn your setbacks into comebacks?
[time=2345] Then you must acknowledge your calling. Chapter three, verse one.
[time=2356] The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time. Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaimed it the message that I give you.
[time=2368] Verse three, and Jonah obeyed the Lord. And Jonah obeyed the Lord.
[time=2378] Step number two, in turning a setback into a comeback, is to acknowledge your calling.
[time=2386] God said, Jonah, I want you to be a prophet. Jonah said, I don't want to be a prophet. I'm not going to be a prophet and I'm not going to go to Nineveh.
[time=2395] God came to him a second time and Jonah listened. God said, I want you to be a prophet. Jonah said, I'll be a prophet.
[time=2403] God said, I want you to go to Nineveh. He said, I'll go to Nineveh. God said, I want you to say this message.
[time=2410] And Jonah said, I'll say that message. He accepted his calling. He acknowledged that this was God's will for his life and he began to obey it.
[time=2422] His previous response was one out of personal gratification and self-comfort. This one is obedience to the Lord.
[time=2431] If you want to turn your life around, what you must do is not only say, I was wrong, but you must say, and I will accept my responsibilities now.
[time=2443] You would be amazed at how many times Christians rationalized the fact that they made a mistake, but then they say, well, it's too late now.
[time=2453] My marriage has already ended in divorce. My kids already gone. I used to have some friends that needed to know Christ, but I've lost the relationship with them.
[time=2463] We need to put a family budget together. That's our setback, but, you know, we're into these habits and, you know, you can't teach old horses new tricks.
[time=2472] And even though many people are willing to admit they're wrong, doesn't mean they're willing to start doing what's right.
[time=2480] Step number two is this. You must accept your calling.
[time=2487] God has called you to be a witness. That's your calling. He's called you to be an ambassador. That is your calling.
[time=2495] He has called you to be a godly parent. That is your calling. He's called you to be a godly husband. That's our calling.
[time=2502] He's called you to be a godly wife. That is your calling. Two weeks ago, Charles Colson was in town, and he said the church has lost its calling.
[time=2514] He said the church's calling is one single thing. He was right. Your calling and my calling is to mirror the righteousness of God before our lost world.
[time=2529] That's what you're here for. That's what I'm here for so that in the talk times and the magnifices and in the real estate offices and the cul-de-sacs of our lives, we are reflecting the righteousness of God.
[time=2542] That is our calling. As surely as God called Jonah to Nineveh, he's called in each and every one of us to Fort Wayne, and we are to mirror his righteousness.
[time=2556] Step three, in turning a setback into a comeback, is to act upon your commitment. It says Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord, and he went to Nineveh.
[time=2573] He not only accepted his calling, but he acted on his calling.
[time=2580] One of the great mistakes many of us make is we get all emotional at the end of a church service, our special revival meeting.
[time=2588] And somebody asked us to rededicate our life to God, and we're willing to kneel an altar, we're willing to bow our heads, we're willing to fold our hands and say, "God, I'm sorry, I was wrong, and I'll do it."
[time=2599] Get up from that altar, go home, eat the lunch that we had planned, and never make one step of action in our life.
[time=2610] Jonah's third step was he went to Nineveh. That was no small challenge.
[time=2617] Where the whale regurgitated him up on the dry land, we don't know. He was in the Mediterranean Sea, so he may have been anywhere on the Egyptian, the Israeli, or the north coast of what's now Lebanon, but in all likelihood he was an average of 500 miles from Nineveh.
[time=2636] 500 hard miles from Nineveh. 500 miles that would take him on a caravan, not a dodged caravan, a camel caravan, up mountains, down mountains, dodging bandits and villains, skirting the edge of the desert, barely making it from Oasis to Oasis, a journey of a month, bouncing on the hump of a dramadary.
[time=2663] And after he went through 30 days of hardship, he was just now ready to begin his mission. That wasn't his mission.
[time=2674] That was just getting ready to complete his mission, but he acted on his commitment.
[time=2685] You know, one of the hard things is, the more time there is between when you make your commitment and fulfill your commitment, that's all time to talk yourself out of it.
[time=2696] Can you imagine went through Jonah's mind as he's riding along, bouncing on a camel day after day saying, "Why Nineveh?"
[time=2704] Well, we just passed tire and siden. I bet they need a profit. Maybe I ought to stop by the employment office, see if there are any openings for profits.
[time=2713] But he had 30 days to think about it. 30 days, the voices on the inside were saying, "Hey, you know, God's got somebody in Nineveh. He doesn't need to bring me long distance. Somebody else can tell them about salvation. Somebody else can bring them the word of the Lord."
[time=2730] Do you ever do that? Say, "God, I'm going to be a witness for you. I'm going to tell my family." And then you said, "Well, maybe it'd be better if they heard it from somebody outside the family."
[time=2738] Maybe there's a friend that can tell him. Jonah acted on his commitment. It's amazing how many times, and I'm talking about we, not you, how many times all of us start off make a commitment and fail to act upon it.
[time=2759] People who have sought counseling from a Christian counselor, and the counselor outlined a plan for them, and the person said, "Yeah, that's a good plan. We'll do that plan."
[time=2768] They folded up their plan, stuck it in their coat pocket, and never went back to the plan until the next time they wore that coat and said, "Oh, what's this?"
[time=2776] "Oh, yeah, that's the plan. Stick it here. Ignore the plan. Never act on it." Jonah turned his life around from a life of a setback to a comeback because he acted on the plan.
[time=2795] Some of you have sat down with a Christian businessman who's helped you because your problem, your setback is finances. It's not that you don't make enough. It's that you spend too much.
[time=2810] And you sat down with a Christian businessman, and the outline principal was putting a budget together, and they said, "Now, you go home, put a budget together, and we'll get together."
[time=2820] And you took all their papers home, and you said, "Oh, well, you know, we've been busy. Well, you know, we were going to," and you never acted on that plan.
[time=2831] And your finances are still a disaster because you never acted. Some of you went to a Christian counselor. They outlined three steps for you to take and suggested that you read a book that will give you great insight, and you just haven't had time to buy the book yet.
[time=2846] You're not acting on the plan. Step number four, if you want to turn your setbacks into comebacks, you must accept the challenges.
[time=2862] You must accept the challenges. Jonah didn't want to go to Nineveh because Nineveh was a long way away.
[time=2870] He didn't want to go to Nineveh because Nineveh was a huge city and he was one man, and he didn't want to go to Nineveh because the Ninevites had never been to a Dale Carnegie course in their life.
[time=2881] They were hostile, mean people, and he didn't want to go there. So he ran away from God and went through a setback.
[time=2889] Now God gives him a second chance. You know what? Nineveh is still a long way away.
[time=2894] Nineveh got just a little bit bigger during his delay, and they got a little bit more hostile, and none of his challenges went away.
[time=2904] Here's the mistake we make as Christians. We ignore God. We went away from God. We get knee-deep in our problems.
[time=2911] I mean, we're up this high in digestive juices of the whale, and we decide it's time to pray, and we tell ourselves, if I just recommit my life to Lord, all of my problems will go away.
[time=2925] Wrong. All of your problems will still be there, and a few new ones, because now you're committed to Christ, and all the people in your family and life who aren't committed to Christ are going to be the sand people rubbing against you.
[time=2940] Nothing becomes easier because you get right with God. Things may get a little tougher, but remember what Kevin sang this morning.
[time=2950] His eyes always on you. He never sleeps. He never slumbers. He says, "I'm with you, always." But the challenges are still there.
[time=2964] If you look at verses 3 and 4, you'll see one of the challenges of Nineveh.
[time=2970] Now, Nineveh was a very important city, a visit required three days. His first challenge was that Nineveh was a huge city.
[time=2982] By saying three days, it didn't mean it took three days to walk from the east end to the west or from the south to the north.
[time=2989] I think what he was saying is in order to touch bases with all the principal locations and preach the gospel, he would need three days.
[time=2999] A few weeks ago, Senator Dan Coates came back to Indiana to announce his candidacy that he was going to run for reelection.
[time=3007] It took him two days to make it to the ten major cities in Indiana where there could hold news conferences. He did that with a jet plane.
[time=3016] Jonah had to do it by foot and it was going to take him three days to make it to all of the principal locations in that city without the assistance of newspaper.
[time=3026] Without the assistance of media, of television or radio, he was going to need three days just to preach the gospel message of repentance one time.
[time=3039] It was a huge city. Its walls, as I mentioned last week, were 50 feet thick, 100 feet wide, eight miles in circumference.
[time=3052] City on the inside suburbs with twice the population on the outside and God calls him as a one man missionary.
[time=3063] But his challenge was even greater because not only was it a city that was huge, it was a city that was hostile.
[time=3071] If you look down into the later verses eight and nine, even the king, the principal leader of the land says, let's call urgently upon God, let us give up evil ways and violence.
[time=3089] It was rather self indicting. He says, the people of that land were hostile people, of violent people.
[time=3099] A few generations later, God raises up a second prophet to go to Nineveh. His name is Nahum.
[time=3105] The books of the Bible go Jonah, Micah, Nahum. Here's Nahum chapter three verses one through four. It's a description of what Nineveh was like.
[time=3114] Woe to the city of blood. Full of lies. Full of plunder. The crack of whips and the clatter of wheels galloping horses and jolting chariots.
[time=3127] Charging cavalry, flashing swords and glittering spears. Many casualties. Piles of dead. Bodies without number.
[time=3139] People stumbling over corpses. All because of wanton lust of the harlot. Alluring mistress of sorceries who enslaved nations by her prostitution and people by her witchcraft.
[time=3153] Listen to the list of indictments. Rise, violence, plunder, immorality, witchcraft, prostitution, murder of bodies beyond number.
[time=3166] Not actually a candidate for becoming an all-america city. I mean, this was the worst of it all.
[time=3175] How would you like to be the one guy that God sends to a city of a half a million violent people in your job is to go say, "Hi men and women, just thought you might want to know that God's upset with you and repent?"
[time=3190] I mean, you know what they did, the guys that said that? They killed them.
[time=3196] They put Jeremiah, the prophet in stocks and threw their garbage at him. And those were the Israelites, the followers of God. These are the enemies of God.
[time=3207] Jonah didn't want to go. His challenges were there. But he had to accept his challenges. And he did.
[time=3216] And the most amazing miracle in this book is not the miracle of the storm. It's not the miracle of the great fish. It's not the miracle that Jonah survived.
[time=3225] The greatest miracle of this book is that God brought a revival to these people and the entire population repented.
[time=3234] It says, "First, the people repented and then secondly, the king repented." You know, that's usually how reform goes.
[time=3242] I'm all for praying for the president, the vice president, the cabinet, the congress, the mayor, the governor, and the dog catcher. Praying for them all.
[time=3249] But if you want revival to come, it comes from the grassroots. It's when people change.
[time=3254] Harry Truman, who was right, when he said, "Leadership is simply finding a parade and getting in front of it."
[time=3263] That's what this king did. He saw that there was a parade and it was heading towards revival. It was a parade marked by repentance.
[time=3271] And when he saw that everybody else was repenting, he said, "As your king and leader, I'm now going to call our nation to repent."
[time=3278] It made good press coverage. But the repentance came at the grassroots level. How did it happen?
[time=3291] Well, there are these three suggestions. One reason that may have aided this miraculous revival was that, excuse me, in 763 and in 759, this land went through a terrible famine.
[time=3310] And in between those two events in 762, there was a complete, solar eclipse.
[time=3316] The ancients took those things of signs that God was judging them. And so in these days of natural calamity and disaster, when a prophet came on the scene, they were ripe for his message.
[time=3329] That no doubt was a part of it. Others suggested it was the person of Jonah himself. If you've ever heard the Christian comedian Mike Warnke, he does a great rendition, humorously on Jonah.
[time=3342] He says, "Picture this. Jonah is running away from the Lord. He decides to split. He gets thrown overboard, and this whale swallows him.
[time=3350] And he's on the first ever air-conditioned submarine ride through the Mediterranean Sea.
[time=3356] Then God hits the automatic eject button. Here comes Jonah, boom, on dry land.
[time=3362] He's walking along the shore, and ahead of him there is this Ninevite surf fisherman just out there, minding his own business, fishing, trying to catch some of the bigger fish.
[time=3372] And behind him, he hears this, squish, squish, squish, squish. And he turns around, and here's this guy, completely bleached white from the whale's stomach gases.
[time=3389] He's wearing half-digested clothes. He's got a half-eaten piece of seaweed draped across his head. His clothes are soaking wet and he walks up and says, "Repant."
[time=3404] You got to admit, that is great staging. Now, to be honest with you, it didn't happen that way because there are no Ninevites who surf fish.
[time=3412] There is no surf in Nineveh. It's an inland city. But the point is still valid. No doubt Jonah's story came to them as rather impressive.
[time=3425] And of all the people that it would impress, it would be the Ninevites because they had created their own God, and the God that they created was the God Dagon that was half man, half fish.
[time=3437] And now this man from the fish comes and they're primed. You know, the real reason why they repented is the spirit of God moved in their lives.
[time=3449] And Jonah was not only a prophet who had a setback turn into a comeback. This was a wicked city who God was ready to set them back in judgment, but when they repented, God gave them a comeback.
[time=3465] Do you need to come back in your life? Four things you need to do. Number one, assume the consequences for your mistake.
[time=3474] Number two, acknowledge the calling that God has given you.
[time=3478] Number three, act on your commitment. And number four, accept the challenges of the future.
[time=3485] God will make your setback a comeback.
