[time=723] - Hello and thank you again for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=727] We look forward to these few moments that we break away from the morning worship service and talk directly with you friends.
[time=734] Joining Pete and myself is our good friend Steve Longbrake who's the administrator of our school.
[time=738] Good morning, gentlemen.
[time=740] - Morning, Rick.
[time=742] When we come together like this and break away from our regular service, we are always excited and we have special events that we can announce to you.
[time=750] We want you to take note of March 18th on Sunday morning, Steve and Maria Gardner will be our special guest.
[time=756] Steve and Maria are formerly from Fort Wayne and they now live in California, but they'll be with us at our 915 service and our 1050 service.
[time=764] I hope that you'll set that data side and join us right here at the worship center of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=770] And then in April on Good Friday, April 13th, we're having a special Good Friday service at the Grand Wayne Center downtown.
[time=779] This will be a very short service from 1215 to 1245.
[time=783] I hope you can take this opportunity to join us.
[time=787] Steve, we're glad that you can join us today.
[time=789] - I'm glad to be here also.
[time=791] I'm here this morning because I'd like to encourage you to consider Black Hawk Christian School for your young students.
[time=797] We begin our 18th year next fall as a Christian school here in Fort Wayne.
[time=801] We've had 10 years of graduates now and we're really proud of them.
[time=804] We have openings in kindergarten first and second grade yet.
[time=808] We haven't opened up applications to our general public.
[time=810] Only the church family and school family have had opportunity to do that.
[time=814] And Monday, March 12th is a day that it's available for you to come and apply to enter your children into Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=822] We have some small waiting lists and other grade levels, but there are definitely openings in kindergarten first and second grade as we begin to double track our school.
[time=831] We're looking forward to growing even more in the future.
[time=833] We need you to do that.
[time=834] Please consider our school.
[time=836] - Steve, how can our friends who are interested in their students coming to Black Hawk start that process?
[time=842] - It's very easy for you to get involved in Black Hawk Christian.
[time=845] You can call us at 4937400 and we'll be glad to send you applications.
[time=852] If you'd like to stop by, you can do that at 7400 East State Street here in Fort Wayne.
[time=857] - Thank you, Steve.
[time=858] Today we have an album to share with you that was recorded by our choir.
[time=862] This album has been a source of joy and inspiration to our family.
[time=866] This is the last week we're going to be sharing the opportunity for you to receive a copy for simply writing in and asking for it.
[time=873] It's a great majestic album that has a few songs that will quiet your heart like people need the Lord and then some that will build up to a crescendo of praise.
[time=884] You'll love the mix and you'll love the sound.
[time=886] We want to share this with you as a gift from us to you.
[time=890] - You can receive this album by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=900] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=907] - Thank you, Pete and Steve for joining us here today.
[time=912] I want to end this segment with you by sharing a personal announcement.
[time=917] Many of you, I'm sure, have heard about the changes in my life in the Fort Wayne area by simply keeping in touch with the local news.
[time=925] On Monday morning, we got up thinking that our life was normal.
[time=931] On Monday night, we received a phone call that prompted us to act on a decision that we had made a few months earlier.
[time=938] That decision was to postpone running for Congress.
[time=942] During the past week, we came to a conclusion on Thursday, the 1st of March, that we indeed thought this was our heart's desire and God's leading in our life.
[time=953] And so, we filed as a candidate for Congress.
[time=957] That means a number of things as it relates to our church and the Bible Hour.
[time=961] I have given my resignation, and it has been accepted by our Board of Elders, and it is dated for Sunday, March the 25th.
[time=971] I'll be with you a few more weeks as the voice and the teacher of the Bible Hour, and I want to thank you for all of the encouragement you've been to me over these past nine years that it's my privilege to be your pastor teacher.
[time=984] Your letters, your comments as we have met in public have been a source of great joy and strength in my life.
[time=991] Your financial support has been overwhelming to keep this ministry strong.
[time=996] I can't thank you enough for giving me the privilege of coming into your home, your hospital room, perhaps the nursing home.
[time=1003] Wherever we have been together by way of television, it has always been a joy for me, and I want to thank you for that privilege.
[time=1010] The Bible Hour will be going through some days of transition.
[time=1014] I know what that's about.
[time=1015] I remember 1981 when Pastor Jeremiah, the founder of this church in this television ministry moved to California.
[time=1022] Those were not the easiest days, but God brought us through them in a great way, and I know he'll bring us through this transition in an equally effective way as well.
[time=1032] But that means we're going to need your support, your support for the church, your support for the Bible Hour.
[time=1039] You need to tell your friends to watch the Bible Hour.
[time=1041] We need you to faithfully write letters and let us know how God's using this ministry in your life.
[time=1048] You friends that have financially supported the ministry, I hope you'll keep doing that even though there'll be a different pastor/teacher.
[time=1055] We appreciate you.
[time=1056] The decision I've come to in my personal life is one that we wrestled with for a long time and became very active in that decision during the past week.
[time=1066] I'm looking forward to serving this community.
[time=1069] But my purpose during this hour that we call the Bible Hour is not to talk about campaigns or candidacies, but to preach and to teach God's Word.
[time=1077] And that's our purpose.
[time=1079] I'm looking forward to sharing the last message out of the book of Jonah today, lessons on facing frustration.
[time=1085] I hope I'm not causing too much in the life of our church or in your life.
[time=1090] We've got some biblical principles that we want to teach, and that is the heartbeat of this ministry.
[time=1095] As we go back to our morning worship service, you're going to enjoy the ministry of Keith Brodigan, and he sings a perfect song.
[time=1101] He sings about the grace of our God, that he gives more grace day by day, and we're trusting for this ministry and in our lives that God's grace will be sufficient.
[time=1116] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 193 seconds]
[time=1317] - Our God and Father, we come to the well of your grace
[time=1327] and ask you to give and to give and to give again.
[time=1332] We ask for the strength that your grace can give this morning to John and Benetta Eastis.
[time=1338] As today they bury their son.
[time=1340] We ask you to pick them up in your arms and to carry them and to give to them the promise of your word.
[time=1347] Fulfill what you've declared that there's a peace from God that surpasses understanding.
[time=1353] Father, we ask you today to keep the hope alive on the heart of Scott Lee.
[time=1362] As he tries to fight back from an automobile accident that's devastating consequences on his body.
[time=1369] We ask you to encourage his mother and his father.
[time=1372] We ask you today to give strength to those who are walking through the hardest valleys of life.
[time=1378] We pray this morning for the family of Amy Moore.
[time=1382] We pray for little Amy that you'll give her release from the anxiety and the helplessness of her life.
[time=1388] Give her occasions of joy even in a bed that is a permanent home.
[time=1393] We ask you today to give strength to the heart of those who have learned this week, the infidelity of their spouse.
[time=1404] Others have learned that their health, they thought was so secure, it's fragile.
[time=1409] Some of us have learned that our futures which seemed obvious and clear have been radically changed and we need your grace.
[time=1417] We come to you to give to you our worship.
[time=1420] We know you don't need it, but you've made us to praise you.
[time=1425] And when we praise you, we get lifted up.
[time=1427] Thank you for the exaltation that we could give to the name of Jesus as Keith and the choir sang.
[time=1433] Thank you for the fulfillment of spirit that it gave to us to hear it.
[time=1438] And now as we open your word, we open our hearts, ask you to teach us lessons for life and lessons for eternal life.
[time=1447] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1449] If you have your Bible today, I would invite you to open it to Jonah chapter four.
[time=1456] Jonah chapter four.
[time=1460] The title of this morning's message and the study of Jonah was chosen weeks and weeks ago.
[time=1467] There was no planning to the timetable, yet the title of today's message is facing frustration.
[time=1474] Allow me to read Jonah chapter four for you.
[time=1478] But Jonah was greatly displeased and became angry.
[time=1483] He prayed to the Lord.
[time=1485] Oh Lord, is this not what I said when I was still at home?
[time=1491] That is why I was so quick to flee to Tarshish.
[time=1495] I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from Sunday calamity.
[time=1509] Now, oh Lord, take away my life.
[time=1514] For it is better for me to die than to live.
[time=1517] But the Lord replied, have you any right to be angry
[time=1526] Jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city.
[time=1531] There he made himself a shelter and sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city.
[time=1538] Then the Lord provided a vine and made it grow up over Jonah
[time=1545] to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort.
[time=1549] And Jonah was very happy about the vine.
[time=1553] But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm which chewed the vine so that it withered.
[time=1558] When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind
[time=1564] and the sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint.
[time=1568] He wanted to die and said it would be better for me to die than to live.
[time=1575] But God said to Jonah, do you have a right to be angry
[time=1581] about the vine?
[time=1582] Why do he said, I am angry enough to die?
[time=1586] What the Lord said, you have been concerned about this vine
[time=1592] though you did not tend it or make it grow.
[time=1595] It sprang up overnight and died overnight.
[time=1600] But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left and many cattle as well should I be concerned about that great city.
[time=1614] Jonah's life as it's portrayed to us in these four chapters are a case study in frustration.
[time=1623] Let me illustrate what I mean.
[time=1626] Do you remember the old country comedian, Grandpa Jones, usually did his routine without his teeth?
[time=1633] He had a, that's good, no, that's bad.
[time=1636] Oh, that's bad, no, that's good routine.
[time=1640] Let me do that with the life of Jonah.
[time=1642] Jonah had a happy and content life.
[time=1646] That's good, no, that's bad because God called him
[time=1652] from that happy and content life to go to Nineveh.
[time=1657] Oh, that's bad.
[time=1660] No, that's good because Jonah decided not to go to the Nineveh Northeast but the Tarshes Southwest.
[time=1667] Phew, that's good, no, that's bad because while he was on a ship heading to Tarshes, God had a great storm in the sea blow up.
[time=1677] Oh, that's bad, no, that's good.
[time=1681] God called him the sea back down.
[time=1684] Oh, that's good, no, that's bad.
[time=1687] God had the sea calm down by having the crew throw him overboard.
[time=1692] Oh, that's bad, no, no, that's good because God rescued Jonah miraculously.
[time=1699] That's good, no, that's bad.
[time=1704] God rescued him by having a whale come along and go Trump and swallow him whole.
[time=1710] Oh, that's bad, no, that's good because the whale regurgitated him right back up safe and alive on dry land.
[time=1718] That's good, that's bad.
[time=1722] Now he had to go to Nineveh and preach.
[time=1725] Oh, that's bad, no, that's good.
[time=1730] The people of Nineveh repented and God showed mercy.
[time=1734] Oh, that's good, no, that's bad because Jonah wanted God to zap him in Nineveh.
[time=1741] Oh, that's bad, no, that's good.
[time=1747] Jonah just went out of town, sat down and pouted about it and got out of that city.
[time=1752] Oh, that's good, no, that's bad because he got hotter than he could stand.
[time=1759] Oh, that's bad, no, that's good because God miraculously caused a vine to come up, grow over him and give him shade.
[time=1766] Oh, that's good, no, that's bad because the next morning a worm ate the vine.
[time=1773] Oh, that's bad.
[time=1776] No, that's good because God taught Jonah a lesson that if he could care about that vine, he sure ought to care about the people of Nineveh.
[time=1784] Is that ever sound like your life?
[time=1785] As soon as you think something's good, you find out that it's bad.
[time=1790] As soon as you think something is bad and you make plans to change it, you find out, it was good.
[time=1795] And your life is filled with frustration and change and things out of your control.
[time=1800] How do you face that?
[time=1802] Another writer illustrated his disappointment in frustration with these words.
[time=1808] "On ever from this childhood hour, "I have seen my fondest hopes decay.
[time=1814] "I never loved a tree or a flower, "but it was the first to fade away.
[time=1819] "I have never nursed a dear gazelle "that gladdened me with its soft eye, "but when I came to know it well, "and love it, it was the first to die." Let's filled with frustrations and pains and the sudden loss of the things that you love the most.
[time=1839] Amongst all of that despair, someone put it humorously this way.
[time=1845] I never had a piece of bread, particularly long or wide, but it fell upon the sandy floor and always on the buttered side.
[time=1854] Never happened to you.
[time=1856] You had a good grip on life and it got away and before you could pick it up, your life was dusty and dirty and it just seemed unusable.
[time=1865] It's called frustration.
[time=1867] Jonah's life in the fourth study is a window into the soul of a human being to see the causes of frustration.
[time=1876] As I've studied Jonah chapter four, I have found five causes of frustration in Jonah's life that I'd like to share with you.
[time=1885] And then I'd like to draw us back to a little bit of hope with three cures that you can take.
[time=1889] Cause of frustration number one in Jonah's life is this one.
[time=1894] He had an unbowed will.
[time=1902] Chapter four is nothing more than the reoccurrence of chapter one with all of the shopping and the window dressing changed.
[time=1909] Chapter one is that God had a will for the city of Nineveh.
[time=1913] And Jonah said, no, I won't do it.
[time=1917] And they had quite a tug of war whether Jonah was gonna serve God or not.
[time=1922] And somewhere between the time that the seaweed wrapped around his neck at the bottom of the ocean and the whale swallowed him whole, he decided there are worse places to be the Nineveh.
[time=1933] And he bowed his will to God.
[time=1938] But as soon as he got back on land and things started getting back to normal, so did his heart.
[time=1946] And the heart that was surrendered on the depths of the ocean was now rebellious on dry land.
[time=1952] And God still had a plan for Nineveh and Jonah didn't like it.
[time=1957] And he wasn't about to bow his knee again to the will of God and he was frustrated.
[time=1963] He was a man torn up on the inside because he didn't surrender his life to God's will.
[time=1971] As a follower of Jesus Christ, surrendering our will to him is a constant daily struggle.
[time=1983] We cannot simply bow our heads and say, Lord Jesus, I'm 37 years old.
[time=1990] I want you to take over my life and I surrender my will to you, amen, and get it and say, phew, glad I've got that done.
[time=1997] Life's gonna be a breeze between now and age 65 when I retire, doesn't work that way.
[time=2003] It is a daily struggle.
[time=2006] Let me illustrate it this way.
[time=2007] Have you ever had any small children in your home?
[time=2011] I ever said to them on one morning and said, you know, you need to keep your room cleaned up and then said to your wife or your husband, phew, I'm glad we've got that important lesson of childhood learned and completed.
[time=2025] Doesn't work like that.
[time=2027] Neither does the surrendering of our will to God.
[time=2032] It is a daily struggle to help children realize that it is easier to hang clothes back up than to dig through the pile the next morning.
[time=2043] And it's a lot easier if they do it than if they're forced to do it.
[time=2049] It's a lot easier if you surrender your will to God and follow him.
[time=2054] Life works better.
[time=2057] I didn't say it's easy and it's always pleasant.
[time=2059] Life works better.
[time=2062] If there wasn't a God and if there wasn't a Jesus, I'd be a Christian.
[time=2066] Because the Christian principles make life work.
[time=2070] But there is a God and there is a Jesus and that takes those principles and gives them power and dynamics, but we've got to surrender to him.
[time=2079] And like children, it's a lot easier if we do it than right with God and him make us do it.
[time=2085] Jonah's first problem was that he had an unbowed will.
[time=2092] His second problem was this one.
[time=2094] He had unbridled emotions.
[time=2098] Look at chapter four, verse one.
[time=2100] And you can see the building to a crescendo of his emotions.
[time=2107] But Jonah was greatly displeased.
[time=2111] And then became angry.
[time=2115] And after he became angry, he come to verse four.
[time=2119] He became totally despondent and said, I'd rather die.
[time=2122] Emotions have the ability to exaggerate the problem.
[time=2129] What is a problem on the scale of one to 10
[time=2135] should register as a two, register as a three.
[time=2140] And then you get the mulling it over in your heart and your mind and all the complications and all the ramifications and it becomes a five.
[time=2147] And then when you think of what life's gonna be like since it's no longer two, it's gonna be a five, you suddenly realize it's really more like a seven.
[time=2154] And when you think of how am I gonna live with this problem at a level of seven, you say, it's a 10.
[time=2158] I might as well die.
[time=2160] Life has a way of snowballing on us and it happens when our emotions are out of control.
[time=2170] Wonderful book has been written.
[time=2172] Tell yourself the truth.
[time=2174] Let me illustrate this away.
[time=2176] A friend of mine who's quite an actress does.
[time=2178] Her father is one of these guys who, whatever little problem happens, he makes it bigger.
[time=2184] And then he thinks of what worse could happen.
[time=2186] And if that happened, what the consequences will be on the national economy.
[time=2190] So it's a 10 o'clock at night, living out in the country.
[time=2193] He opens up his refrigerator to get a glass of milk and he goes, oh no, we don't have any milk.
[time=2198] Oh no, we don't have any milk.
[time=2201] We won't be able to eat breakfast.
[time=2203] We live way out of the country.
[time=2204] We're never gonna have breakfast again.
[time=2205] We're gonna starve.
[time=2206] We've got all these responsibilities.
[time=2207] We don't have any food now.
[time=2209] And suddenly, he's gonna die.
[time=2212] No milk.
[time=2212] You might want some milk for breakfast.
[time=2217] You're not gonna die.
[time=2218] But you can get your emotions cut loose out of control and in serious trouble.
[time=2226] The third thing that caused his frustration was he had unbecoming responses.
[time=2235] Life was not working out the way he wanted it.
[time=2238] His agenda had been changed.
[time=2241] His values had been interrupted.
[time=2243] And he said, I don't have to put up with this.
[time=2247] I don't have to take this.
[time=2249] And he solved his problem.
[time=2251] He said, I'm just gonna leave Nineveh.
[time=2253] I'm gonna walk out in the debtors and I'm just gonna sit down.
[time=2257] That'll change the world.
[time=2259] You know, that's not very foreign though.
[time=2262] How many of you have had some cross words exchanged by your spouse?
[time=2267] And so you just walked out of the room.
[time=2269] You sat down, looked at the TV.
[time=2272] Never turned it on, but you just looked at the TV.
[time=2274] They know that they're being punished.
[time=2278] You just look at the TV.
[time=2279] And they say, what's wrong?
[time=2282] And you say, nothing.
[time=2283] What are you doing?
[time=2286] Watching TV.
[time=2288] You're gonna sit there.
[time=2289] That's gonna solve the problem.
[time=2291] We're gonna pout.
[time=2292] Others of us respond this way.
[time=2294] Oh yeah, you said that fine.
[time=2296] I have a master card.
[time=2297] Charge.
[time=2299] You know, I'll punish you.
[time=2300] You know, there's no problem in the world that can't be compensated by a new purchase.
[time=2305] I'll feel better.
[time=2306] That'll make things work.
[time=2309] And our attitude is to give the most unbecoming of responses.
[time=2314] It is so childish.
[time=2316] I remember being somewhere around eight to 10 years old.
[time=2319] It's a beautiful summer day.
[time=2322] The neighborhood swimming pool is calling, Rick, come swim, Rick, come swim.
[time=2327] And at the lunch table, my mother announces that we, my mother, my sister, and myself, we are going shopping.
[time=2335] I've shared this with you before.
[time=2336] I don't believe that there's purgatory, but if there is one, it's a mall.
[time=2340] (audience laughs) And I asked in a very responsible way if I could just go to the swimming pool and I would stay there and, you know, the lifeguard could be the unofficial babysitter and she said, no, and I asked in a very nice way.
[time=2353] And then I asked in a very inappropriate way and she said, you're going shopping.
[time=2358] That really bothered me because the way I talked to my mother, I knew when my father came home, whatever I did between then and my dad came home would be my last act on earth and I didn't think that should be shopping.
[time=2371] (audience laughs) And she said, you are going with us.
[time=2375] You're not old enough to stay by yourself.
[time=2377] Solve that problem.
[time=2379] Went out the house, slammed the back door, went into the woods behind our house and I got in my tree fort and I sat down.
[time=2385] Solve the problem.
[time=2388] So my sister came along and said, here's your dog, if you're running away from home, she's your responsibility.
[time=2396] (audience laughs) My sister always was that way.
[time=2400] And sooner or later, the dog got hungry and we came home.
[time=2407] And our response caused more problems than the original situation.
[time=2413] And every time Jonah makes the wrong response, he gets in deeper.
[time=2420] The next cause of his dilemma was his unbending expectations.
[time=2428] Jonah had his heart set on how life was gonna go.
[time=2433] He was mining his own business, living in the land of Israel, serving as a part-time prophet, getting into the baits over on Arraria, thought he had worried things worked out and suddenly God's gonna send him as an ambassador to the hostile Ninevites.
[time=2448] And that wasn't on his agenda.
[time=2451] He flipped open his day timer, checked the calendar and he was busy.
[time=2455] This isn't what he had on his schedule.
[time=2457] And when he finally bowed to God's will and he went to Nineveh, he had expectations of what was gonna happen.
[time=2465] And when those expectations didn't plan out.
[time=2468] And when those didn't pan out, he went out in the desert and sat down, enjoyed this vine that grew up and he had expectations that it was gonna be there.
[time=2476] Nothing worked out the way he expected it to work out.
[time=2480] And that's the way life is.
[time=2483] Things don't work out the way we expect them to work out and we must learn to bend and to give.
[time=2493] And Jonah didn't know how to do that.
[time=2495] He only knew how to pout.
[time=2498] He only knew how to complain.
[time=2499] And his expectations was God will leave me alone.
[time=2502] I don't have to go anywhere I don't wanna go.
[time=2504] His expectation was if I go to Nineveh, Nineveh, God's gonna zap him.
[time=2510] If I go out in the desert, God will leave me alone.
[time=2513] None of his expectations worked out.
[time=2516] Life is full of surprises.
[time=2518] Life is full of change.
[time=2520] Things happen out of our control.
[time=2522] Car accidents kill our sons.
[time=2524] Other ones put them in intensive care.
[time=2526] Cancer creeps into our body when we are the image of perfect health.
[time=2531] Companies close, factories shut down, unemployment lines become realities.
[time=2538] All of these things happen and they're outside of our control, they're outside of our expectation and we are so frustrated.
[time=2545] The fifth and final cause of Jonah's frustration
[time=2551] was his unbiblical priorities.
[time=2555] He cared about things, about comfort, about vines.
[time=2560] More than he cared about people.
[time=2564] It was a real big deal to Jonah that this vine was gone.
[time=2570] But it was no big deal to him that he wanted a whole city to be destroyed.
[time=2575] He didn't care about those people.
[time=2579] He cared about his comfort, taught out here.
[time=2582] What happened to my vine?
[time=2583] And God says, "Jona, how can you care so much about a vine when in the city of Nineveh there are 120,000 people who don't know their right hand from their left hand?"
[time=2599] Now there's an interpretation to be debated.
[time=2603] Was God saying that means that in Nineveh there were so many people that there were 120,000 infants, toddlers and small children who hadn't learned their right from their left yet?
[time=2614] Possibly that's what it means.
[time=2616] It's just as possible that God was not talking about them intellectually, but he was talking about them spiritually.
[time=2621] He was saying these people are absolutely spiritually ignorant, don't you care about them?
[time=2627] Don't you want them to know spiritual up from down, right from wrong, left from right?
[time=2632] How can you care so much about your botany?
[time=2638] And not about the people.
[time=2639] A girl by the name of Lana Young came here as a teenager
[time=2645] and she sang a song, the basic thing was this, using people and loving things, that's not the way it's meant to be, but loving people and using things, that's the way it ought to be.
[time=2662] Jonah was a man who cared about his things, he didn't care about people.
[time=2668] What caused his frustration?
[time=2671] Probably the same things that caused our frustration.
[time=2675] An unbowed will, unbridled emotions, unbecoming responses, unbending rigid expectations, unbiblical priorities.
[time=2690] What can we do about him?
[time=2693] I want to share three very simple, obvious, straightforward principles.
[time=2698] Let me give them to you in descending order, three, two, one.
[time=2703] Number three, strengthen your acceptance
[time=2709] of the unexpected.
[time=2712] Strengthen your acceptance of the unexpected.
[time=2717] If you have a Bible, flip back to the book of Psalms, Proverbs, right there in the middle of the Old Testament, Proverbs 27, verse one, teaches us the uncertainty of life.
[time=2731] Do not boast about tomorrow,
[time=2739] for you do not know what a day may bring forth.
[time=2742] James in the New Testament says the same principle in a different way, he says, don't say tomorrow, we're gonna go to this city, we're gonna go to Indianapolis, then we're gonna go over to South Bend, and we're gonna do business here, and we'll take the market to the new area, and boy, we're just gonna franchise this, it's gonna go tomorrow.
[time=2760] We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
[time=2764] We have no idea what tomorrow will bring.
[time=2768] Yet, we hold on to our calendar for tomorrow,
[time=2777] as though if everything doesn't happen according to this calendar, the world will spin off of its orbit, and the whole thing will be lost in space.
[time=2785] It's not true.
[time=2788] And the wisest thing we can do is live our life with a divine sense of contingency.
[time=2796] Say, if God wills tomorrow, that doesn't mean you just simply say, all right, here's my agenda, if God wills.
[time=2803] It means saying, whatever God brings for tomorrow, that's what it's gonna be.
[time=2809] To me, it looks like the plan is eight o'clock be here, nine o'clock be there, ten o'clock move to the other side, eleven o'clock jog, twelve o'clock.
[time=2818] You gotta make your plans.
[time=2820] But you need to say, God, here's my calendar, here's what I think I ought to do, but if you've got some changes, I can live with a sense of contingency.
[time=2830] That's how Paul conducted his life.
[time=2833] He said, I'm going to Jerusalem, and I don't know what's gonna happen there.
[time=2838] And certainly, yet confidence.
[time=2842] He wrote Philippians from a Roman prison, and he said, I don't know whether I'm gonna live or die, but if I live, it's opportunities from Christ.
[time=2849] If I die, I'm gonna be with Christ.
[time=2851] Whatever he wants, I'm available.
[time=2853] That's living your life with a sense of contingency.
[time=2859] Second principle I would suggest to you is this one.
[time=2864] Start telling yourself the truth.
[time=2874] I'd like to move from the life of Jonah to the life of another prophet by the name of Elijah.
[time=2880] Elijah was a powerful man of God.
[time=2883] God miraculously worked through him.
[time=2885] He had great confrontation with the prophets of the false gods, and he won, and he was a victorious man, but the federal government was after him, and he fled to the desert.
[time=2896] He sat down under a tree, and he uttered the exact same words as Jonah did.
[time=2901] He said, I've had enough.
[time=2903] I can't take it, Lord.
[time=2905] I want to die.
[time=2907] Please, if you are really God in your merciful, take my life.
[time=2911] And God says, Elijah, what's the problem?
[time=2918] What's the big issue here?
[time=2920] And he said, everyone is defected.
[time=2923] Everyone has gone to the other side.
[time=2927] There isn't anybody left in Israel who has not bowed their knee to the idols of the pagan gods.
[time=2935] And God did a stage production.
[time=2940] I mean, he sent a whirlwind, and he sent a fire, and he got Elijah's attention, but he spoke to him in a still small voice, and he said, there are not all defectors.
[time=2952] There are thousands who have not yet bent their knee.
[time=2956] The truth of the matter was he was filling down,
[time=2962] he was filling discouraged, but the lie that he told himself was, I am the only one.
[time=2967] Have you ever told yourself that lie?
[time=2969] I am the only one who can save this person.
[time=2973] I am the only one who can get this job done.
[time=2975] I'm the only one who stands for the truth.
[time=2978] I'm the only one in this organization that really knows what needs to be done.
[time=2982] We're not.
[time=2984] We need to tell ourselves the truth.
[time=2988] I'm one person that God may use.
[time=2991] He may use somebody else.
[time=2994] I'm not the only one here.
[time=2995] I may feel that, but there are others who are committed to Christ.
[time=2999] Important principle of life is if you're gonna bridle
[time=3005] your emotions and if you're gonna behave appropriately, then you must tell yourself the truth.
[time=3013] Don't exaggerate it.
[time=3015] Typical response to tragedy and disaster is this one.
[time=3019] I can't live like this.
[time=3021] We understand there's a need and a time of immediate response to ventilate.
[time=3027] There also comes a time when we have to tell ourself the truth, you not only can live like this, you don't have any choice, you will live like this.
[time=3036] Now, instead of saying, I can't live like this, tell yourself the truth and say, I don't wanna live like this.
[time=3046] This isn't my choice, but I don't always get my choice.
[time=3051] I wish it could be different, but it can't.
[time=3055] So now, how do I make the best of what I've got?
[time=3059] That's what Jonah needed to do.
[time=3060] Instead of saying, I want it this way, and I want it this way, and if it's not that way, I wanna die is to say, I want it to be different, but God didn't.
[time=3071] Now, how can I live with life the way it is?
[time=3074] Tell yourself the truth.
[time=3078] The first, three, two, one, the countdown, the first and most important principle is this one.
[time=3084] Surrender your will to God.
[time=3094] We talked about his unbound will at the beginning.
[time=3097] He was in a battle with God.
[time=3099] God wanted him to do one thing.
[time=3100] He wanted to do another, and there was a spiritual war going on with him again and again and again, and what he needed to do was to surrender.
[time=3110] In Luke chapter nine, verse 33, Jesus is recorded as saying, "If any man will come after me, let him take up his cross "and follow me daily." If you don't remember any word, remember daily.
[time=3130] Every day of your life, you must surrender your will to Christ.
[time=3134] Every day, and those are the good days.
[time=3138] On the bad days, you must do it hourly.
[time=3140] And on the real bad days, you just gotta keep saying yourself whatever the Lord wants, whatever the Lord wants, whatever the Lord wants, and it is a constant spiritual battle.
[time=3152] The apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 31, "I die daily." This commitment to Christ is not a commitment that we make.
[time=3166] And then a few weeks later, we say, "I'm glad I did that." That was a good experience.
[time=3171] It's a daily experience.
[time=3172] It's not a transition.
[time=3174] It is not a chapter of our lives.
[time=3177] It's the commitment of our lives on an ongoing basis.
[time=3181] Turn if you roll to Romans chapter one.
[time=3183] Famous, I'm sorry, Romans chapter 12, verse one.
[time=3188] Romans 12, one and two, some classic verses of the scripture.
[time=3191] Reads like this, "Therefore I urge you, brothers,
[time=3198] "and view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies "as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.
[time=3206] "This is your spiritual act of worship.
[time=3210] "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of the world, "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=3216] "Then you will be able to test and approve "what God's will is, his good pleasing and perfect will."
[time=3228] The central theme of that is that we are to give our bodies as a living sacrifice on God's altar.
[time=3237] Someone wisely noted that the problem with living sacrifices is they keep crawling off the altar.
[time=3244] The dead ones stay there.
[time=3246] The living ones keep getting off.
[time=3248] And what we have to force ourselves to do is get back on the altar and say, "God, not your will, but mine." William Henley penned these words.
[time=3258] I care not how charged with punishment, the scroll.
[time=3263] I am the captain of my faith.
[time=3266] I am the master of my soul.
[time=3270] And if you have that heart and if you have that spirit, you will live your life miserably and frustrated.
[time=3277] But if you say, God is the captain of my faith.
[time=3283] And Jesus Christ is the master of my soul.
[time=3286] You will ease your frustration level significantly.
[time=3291] I close with this illustration.
[time=3295] It's a number of years old.
[time=3297] It's the story of a man by the name of Bill Mansdorfer.
[time=3302] Bill Mansdorfer lived in Northern California.
[time=3306] His life was filled with frustration and despair.
[time=3309] He drove 25 miles north of the city to a famous spot called the Devil's Slide.
[time=3316] And there he parked his car on the 200-foot cliff of the Pacific Ocean.
[time=3322] And he walked out and he looked over the cliff to take his own life.
[time=3329] He reflected for a moment, turned on the radio in his car.
[time=3333] It happened to be tuned into a Christian station.
[time=3336] And he heard a song, "These are the words." God understands your heartache.
[time=3342] He knows the bitter pain.
[time=3345] Oh, trust him in the darkness.
[time=3348] You cannot trust him in vain.
[time=3351] God understands your sorrow.
[time=3354] He sees the falling tear.
[time=3357] And whispers, "I am with thee." Never falter, never fear.
[time=3366] Feeling pretty frustrated.
[time=3370] Feeling completely isolated.
[time=3372] Surrender your will to God.
[time=3378] What causes frustration?
[time=3380] Five things, not just in Jonah's life, but ours.
[time=3384] An unbowed will.
[time=3387] Two unbridled emotions.
[time=3393] Let it all fly.
[time=3395] Unbecoming responses, number three.
[time=3400] Number four, unbending expectations.
[time=3404] Legidity, number five, unbiblical priorities.
[time=3409] Your agendas and gods cannot be harmonized.
[time=3414] What's the cure?
[time=3416] Number three, strengthen your acceptance of the unexpected.
[time=3422] Number two, start telling yourself the truth.
[time=3427] And number one, surrender your will to God.
[time=3432] And today, can I add just an appendix, a fourth one, sing.
[time=3437] I will rejoice in him and be glad.
[time=3442] Our father, our lives are yours.
[time=3446] This church is yours.
[time=3448] Today, we want to recommit our lives to you.
[time=3453] Resurrender our wills to your glory and your kingdom.
[time=3457] Today, we want to turn the reins of our life over to you and ask you to work in Jesus' name.
