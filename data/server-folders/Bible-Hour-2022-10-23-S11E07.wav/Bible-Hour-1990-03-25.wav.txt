[time=86] On this last Sunday of which it is my privilege to serve you as pastor and teacher, there are three points I would like to share with you.
[time=95] Number one, Jesus Christ promised that he would build his church.
[time=100] Number two, Jesus Christ has built his church.
[time=105] And number three, Jesus Christ is not done building this church yet.
[time=110] (music)
[time=120] Welcome to the Bible Hour with Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=124] Thank you for joining us.
[time=126] Today is Rick's final message as the pastor of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=130] His message today is entitled, "God Built His Church, and He's Not Finished Yet."
[time=136] In this lesson, we will be reminded that Jesus Christ has promised that he would build his church.
[time=142] By a brief look back, we can see that the Lord has kept his promise.
[time=146] He has built his church.
[time=148] But if we also look forward, we can see just as clearly that the Lord is not done building his church.
[time=154] Locate your Bible and open to Matthew 16 to follow along in our study today.
[time=160] Our special music today includes a solo from Kathy Hawks and a song from Reflection.
[time=168] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "This is the King of Glory."
[time=176] (music)
[time=201] Who is this man feeling the poor?
[time=211] Open your eyes and you will see.
[time=215] Who is this man, this children of the Lord?
[time=218] Jesus Christ, he is the King.
[time=222] Who is he holding the debt from the grave?
[time=225] And who is the one who loves his friends?
[time=230] He is the King of Glory, the Lord of strong and holiday.
[time=237] Open your doors and you will see.
[time=240] And He will tell.
[time=249] (music)
[time=257] Open your hearts and you will see.
[time=261] Who is he holding the debt from the grave?
[time=268] He is the King of Glory, the Lord of strong and holiday.
[time=275] Open your doors and you will see the King and you will see.
[time=288] Who is he holding the debt from the grave?
[time=303] Who is this man feeling the poor?
[time=306] Who is he holding the debt from the grave?
[time=319] He is the King of Glory, the Lord of strong and holiday.
[time=327] Open your doors and you will see the King and you will see.
[time=334] Who is he holding the debt from the grave?
[time=341] He is the King of Glory, he is the King of Glory.
[time=349] Who is he holding the debt from the grave?
[time=378] He is the King of Glory, the Lord of strong and holiday.
[time=401] My hope is built on nothing less than that King of Glory and his blood and righteousness.
[time=406] Yes, him number 402, please.
[time=408] We'll sing the first and second stanzas together of him number 402.
[time=436] Who is he holding the debt from the grave?
[time=494] Thank you very much for worshiping the Lord together through music.
[time=499] We appreciate it when you participate with us.
[time=502] We continue with music now as we draw our attention to a special number today by Kathy Hawks.
[time=507] Listen to her as she sings for us right now.
[time=523] As I walked through the door, I sensed his presence.
[time=535] And I knew this was the place we love about us.
[time=549] For this is the tickle to hold upon our eyes.
[time=563] And we are standing in his presence on holy ground.
[time=578] We are standing on holy ground.
[time=589] And I know there are angels all around.
[time=602] Let us praise Jesus now.
[time=613] For me are standing in his presence on holy ground.
[time=628] In his presence there is a joy beyond all the joy.
[time=642] And that his feet, peace, love, can still be wrong.
[time=654] If you haven't, I know he has been so good.
[time=666] Let's reach out and claim it, O child, you are standing on holy ground.
[time=677] We are standing on holy ground.
[time=689] And I know there are angels all around.
[time=700] Let us praise Jesus now.
[time=711] For we are standing in his presence on holy ground.
[time=723] We are standing on holy ground.
[time=735] And I know there are angels all around.
[time=746] Let us praise Jesus now.
[time=757] For we are standing in his presence.
[time=769] We are standing in his presence on holy ground.
[time=782] Holy ground.
[time=792] [APPLAUSE]
[time=799] Hello again and thank you for joining us here today for the Bible Hour.
[time=805] I am so grateful on this beautiful sunny Sunday morning we have this opportunity to talk directly with you friends.
[time=811] This beautiful day reminds us of the resurrection of Jesus Christ when life eternal became a reality.
[time=818] And with Easter are some great events in the life of our church.
[time=821] Rick, indeed this is an exciting time for the Christian church because we do celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday morning.
[time=830] And those dates are coming up, we want to begin with April 13th, that's Good Friday.
[time=835] We will be sponsoring a service at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne at 1215 until 1245.
[time=843] Just a half hour service where we commemorate the death of Jesus Christ and mention the great resurrection.
[time=849] There will be music and drama and a short message to commemorate these days.
[time=855] And then just a couple of days later on April 15th Easter Sunday morning we'll have a grand celebration right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=863] The great deal of music from our sanctuary choir in brass and we will be sharing the message with two of our associate pastors,
[time=870] Pastor Jim Pearson and Tim Teder.
[time=873] If you don't have a church home we invite you to come.
[time=876] We have two services, one at 915 and the other at 1050. Come and join us for that day.
[time=882] I hope those of you who do join us week by week for the Bible Hour and do not have a church home will make every effort to come out and to worship in person on Easter Sunday morning.
[time=892] April the 15th.
[time=895] If you have missed the Bible Hour over the last few weeks you may not be aware of the fact that for Sundays ago I announced my resignation as the pastor of Black Hawk Baptist Church and the leader of all of its ministries including the Bible Hour.
[time=909] It is with a bittersweet heart that I made that decision.
[time=913] It is bitter because we love this church and every one of its ministries particularly the Bible Hour and we are going to miss this opportunity to serve the church, you and this community.
[time=924] But it's also sweet because we are taking a new direction in our life.
[time=928] The one we believe is well we should invest the next chapter of our life.
[time=933] I have resigned because I am now a candidate for the United States Congress and I don't think it would be fair or appropriate for me to run for Congress while serving on the television ministry or in a church.
[time=945] I wouldn't want anyone to think that I was using my position as a clergyman to influence my opportunity to become a congressman.
[time=953] So today is my last day in the pulpit of Black Hawk Baptist Church and this broadcast will be the last one with which I will have the opportunity to share God's Word with you.
[time=963] I want to thank you for your friendship, your financial support, your letters of encouragement, all the things you've done to make this ministry strong.
[time=971] I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss this opportunity.
[time=974] But we're going to be living right here in Indiana and Fort Wayne and still be a part of this community and we'll look forward to seeing you in a lot of different ways.
[time=982] Again, I want to say thank you and farewell.
[time=986] Because this is my last day, there will be a number of people who will be filling the pulpit here at Black Hawk.
[time=992] Sometimes it will be staff members who are part of the team that has worked side by side with me.
[time=997] At other times it will be outside guests who will be coming in to fill our pulpit.
[time=1001] Pete, tell us a little bit about those guests and who will be filling the pulpit over the next two weeks.
[time=1006] Rick, just before I tell them about some of the events, I just want to review our friendship together.
[time=1011] I remember in 1978 when I was leaving the Midwest, we sat in one of the local restaurants and you said if you ever had a church that could merit a full-time minister of music you would call me.
[time=1023] And I had that privilege in 1983 to come back to what surprised me, Black Hawk Baptist Church, where I had been and share with you now these seven years, as long as I've been here,
[time=1035] a great time of fellowship as staff members and friends, and it's been a really wonderful time.
[time=1041] And while we're going to miss you, we really wish you well in your new endeavor, and I'm sure that you're going to prosper along with your wife, Kathy, and we're looking for great things.
[time=1051] But we want to publicly thank you for your friendship, as well as the great preaching that we've heard in the last several years.
[time=1058] Thank you very much.
[time=1059] Peter, I remember that time at the restaurant. I remember it as clear as if it were yesterday.
[time=1065] I can't believe it's been seven years that we've served together, and I love you. I love this church and can't thank you enough for your partnership in the gospel.
[time=1072] Thank you, Rick.
[time=1073] We do want to encourage you to stay tuned to the Bible Hour on April 1st, one of our associate pastors, Jim Pearson, will be speaking in the morning service and on the Bible Hour.
[time=1084] Stay tuned for that and put it on your calendar. And then on April 8th, the following week will have Dr. David Fetser.
[time=1091] Dr. Fetser is the Director of Communications at Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, Illinois.
[time=1097] He is a great communicator, and he will give you a great experience as you listen to him speak the word that Sunday, April 8th.
[time=1105] So we hope that you will join with us on those coming Sundays.
[time=1109] Before we go, we do have a book to share with you. Its title is "Great as the Lord." This is a book that I had the privilege of putting together in my last months here at Blackhawk.
[time=1119] It is a book designed to introduce you to the study of the person of God himself.
[time=1124] His great attributes, his unchanging character, the fact that he is one God, but he manifests himself in three persons.
[time=1132] This is a detailed study, but it's easy reading, and I know it will strengthen your faith.
[time=1137] We've printed these so that we have enough copies not only for the church, but to share with you friends by way of television.
[time=1144] If you would like a copy, we'll send it to you free. You simply write for it today.
[time=1149] You can receive a copy of the booklet "Great as the Lord" by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1161] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1170] Thank you, Peter, and thank you for joining us here today on the Bible Hour.
[time=1175] As we go back to our morning worship service, we're going to hear from the group Reflections.
[time=1179] Kathy has a final song for you, and I have a final message today.
[time=1191] [MUSIC - 284 seconds]
[time=1480] (audience applauds)
[time=1486] - Thank you, Reflection.
[time=1491] Triumphantly, the church will rise for Jesus Christ as promised that he would build his church and nothing.
[time=1499] Nothing, including the gates of hell, could prevail against it.
[time=1503] They have sung of the scripture that we'll study this morning.
[time=1506] If you have a Bible, I invite you to open it to the book of Matthew in the 16th chapter.
[time=1512] I would like to read for you Matthew 16 verses 13 through 20.
[time=1517] When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi,
[time=1523] he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of man is?" They replied, "Some say John the Baptist.
[time=1532] Others say Elijah.
[time=1534] And still others, Jeremiah are one of the prophets."
[time=1540] "But what about you?" he asked.
[time=1543] "Who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus replied, "Blessed are you Simon's son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my father in heaven." And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
[time=1576] I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1579] Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
[time=1586] Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
[time=1593] Our God and Father as we open up your word, we also open up our hearts to you, and our wish this morning is that which filled the heart of John the Baptist.
[time=1605] We wish that we might decrease so that in our lives Jesus Christ might increase.
[time=1612] We ask you to meet with us this morning and to point every eye, to tune every ear, and to seize every heart's attention and focus them all on the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1624] We ask you to use your word to build up our faith.
[time=1627] We ask you to use your word to strengthen our commitment.
[time=1630] We have heard the choir sing.
[time=1632] He is the King of glory.
[time=1634] And Lord Jesus, we now say that you are the King.
[time=1638] You are the King of who I am, amen.
[time=1644] My days are filled with laughter.
[time=1666] My heart has known your peace.
[time=1671] I've traveled far, still there is far to go.
[time=1678] But in my heart there is a longing to look upon your face.
[time=1688] This is where you are, is where I want to be.
[time=1696] You are my King.
[time=1702] You are the land of the two.
[time=1709] The seed of Abraham, the Holy One, God's only son.
[time=1722] You are the King of who I am.
[time=1738] And every road I've traveled down.
[time=1743] You have walked before you.
[time=1746] You made the light too shine in the darkness.
[time=1754] I am looking for the day when I bow before you.
[time=1763] They are my friends, I told you.
[time=1769] Oh Jesus, you are my King.
[time=1779] You are the land of the two.
[time=1786] The seed of Abraham, the Holy One, God's only son.
[time=1799] You are the King of who I am.
[time=1806] You are my King.
[time=1811] You are the land of the two.
[time=1818] The seed of Abraham, the Holy One, God's only son.
[time=1830] You are the King of who I am.
[time=1848] And we do announce on this Sunday morning that Jesus Christ is King.
[time=1863] And more than anything else would you take home the message of the choir, that he is the King of glory, and take home the message of this song that he can be your King.
[time=1875] Oh Lord Jesus, today meet with us.
[time=1878] Teach us your word, root us in the confidence that you are God.
[time=1883] For it's for your name and for your glory that we meet today. Amen.
[time=1889] I'd like to give you three simple points of our outline of study this morning.
[time=1894] Point number one, Jesus said, I will build my church.
[time=1901] Point number two, he's already done that and point number three is he's not done yet.
[time=1908] If you have your Bible, look at that passage that we read aloud a moment ago.
[time=1912] Matthew chapter 16, where Jesus made that statement, I will build my church.
[time=1922] The setting is in the city of Caesarea Philippi.
[time=1925] It's at the uttermost north of the land of Israel.
[time=1928] If you can picture Israel, there is the Dead Sea to the south and very close to that,
[time=1934] the cities of Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
[time=1936] Follow the waters upstream of the Jordan River and you'll come to the Sea of Galilee towards the north.
[time=1943] And even beyond that is the city of Caesarea Philippi.
[time=1947] What was Jesus doing way up there?
[time=1951] He was on the first ever staff planning retreat.
[time=1956] Jesus had been out amongst the people day after day and performing miracle after miracle.
[time=1963] And the more people he helped, the more people who were there wanting help.
[time=1967] And the more he helped them, it seemed to multiply until one occasion, 4,000 people skipped lunch, skipped dinner, sat down all day just to be around Jesus
[time=1978] and they hadn't had food to eat for the entire day.
[time=1981] They do a quick inventory and the marketing department came back and said, "We've got a market here." The supply department said, "We've got nothing to feed him.
[time=1990] We've got one boy, he's got to carry out lunch from Arthur Treacher's.
[time=1993] What are we going to do?" And Jesus said, "That's plenty.
[time=1997] Break it and pass it around." Well, Jesus miraculously multiplied that one little boy's lunch, fed 4,000 people and they had enough for leftovers.
[time=2008] He did that same thing not just once but twice.
[time=2012] Once there were 4,000, he did it again with 5,000 people and everywhere that Jesus went, people were saying, "Help us, teach us, heal us, feed us, take care of us."
[time=2023] And even though he was God, the drains upon his human emotions were taxing beyond anyone's imagination.
[time=2031] And there came not just this time but many times when Jesus literally had to get away from the crowd and the press of people.
[time=2039] And he retreated to the far north, the Caesarea Philippi.
[time=2043] But he turned that retreat into a strategy session and he began to ask questions.
[time=2049] Someone said that Jesus was taking a poll.
[time=2052] He was not.
[time=2053] Polls are taken by politicians who are insecure.
[time=2057] Jesus was not a politician and he was not insecure.
[time=2061] He gathered his disciples around them and he asked them a very simple question and a very safe question.
[time=2068] He said, "Who do people say that I am?" That was very safe.
[time=2073] It was not threatening.
[time=2074] He wasn't pointing at them.
[time=2075] He was talking in very general terms.
[time=2078] What did the Bethlehem Gazette have to say?
[time=2080] What did the Jerusalem Journal have to say?
[time=2082] What did the word of mouth have to say?
[time=2085] And so they instantly responded and everybody chimed in.
[time=2088] One of them said, "They think you're John the Baptist." Well, maybe it was because they had heard John the Baptist message and now they heard Jesus' message and it sounded so similar.
[time=2100] Maybe they were confused and thought it was the same guy.
[time=2103] Maybe from a distance they had seen John and now from a distance they had seen Jesus
[time=2109] and these two cousins may indeed appear to look somewhat similar because they were relatives.
[time=2116] I looked across the auditorium today and saw one of my sisters in law here but I wasn't sure which one of them it was because they looked similar.
[time=2124] Maybe Jesus and John looked just a little bit similar.
[time=2128] Someone else said, "Nog, they think that you're Elijah." Elijah had been dead and gone 900 years but the prophet Malachi said, "Before Messiah comes Elijah will return." And some of them said, "This is it.
[time=2143] This is Elijah made good sense but it wasn't quite accurate." Others said that you're Jeremiah.
[time=2150] Jeremiah was a prophet that lived around five to 600 years before Christ.
[time=2156] He preached a strong message of repentance.
[time=2158] Jeremiah was known as the weeping prophet.
[time=2161] He had one of those tender hearts.
[time=2163] Jesus stood over the city of Jerusalem with this tender heart and said, "Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem." How often I would have liked to gather you as a mother can gather or chicks unto herself but you would not.
[time=2179] And you wept over the city of Jerusalem.
[time=2187] So some thought that Jesus was Jeremiah the prophet.
[time=2191] Others said, "We don't know who he is but he must be one of those prophets." But as the disciples answered the question, public opinion said that Jesus was a man.
[time=2202] They said that Jesus was a good man.
[time=2204] That Jesus was even a man sent from God.
[time=2208] But their definitions all stopped there.
[time=2211] Well having gotten the conversation flowing, Jesus now changes the question only slightly but so significantly.
[time=2219] Instead of saying, "Who do they say that I am?" He looks them straight in the face.
[time=2226] Eyeball to eyeball and he says, "Who do you say that I am?"
[time=2233] He went from the general to the specific.
[time=2236] He went from the nebulous to the personal.
[time=2238] He went from the indirect to the direct.
[time=2240] He went from them to you.
[time=2244] "Who do you say that I am?" Well if you know anything about the disciples, you don't have to read on to guess which one of them was the first one to speak.
[time=2254] It was Simon Peter.
[time=2255] John MacArthur said, "Simon Peter was the disciple with the foot-shaped mouth." Because his foot was constantly going in and out of his mouth.
[time=2262] This is one of those occasions where Peter was absolutely right.
[time=2267] Impulsively yes, instinctively yes, but accurately yes.
[time=2272] Peter says, "You are the Christ.
[time=2276] You are the Son of the living God." Peter could not have picked more precise or more specific terms to identify that Jesus was God.
[time=2289] Some have misunderstood the phrase, "Son of God." And they've tried to add three parts of water to the message and weaken its strength.
[time=2297] You cannot do that.
[time=2299] When Peter used the phrase, "Son of God," he didn't mean that up in heaven there was this great big God and Jesus was this kind of teeny-weeny little God.
[time=2310] No, the word "son" means to be of the same order and the same substance.
[time=2315] We know that biologically and we know it biblically.
[time=2318] Biologically, we know that if a cow has an offspring, it's a cow.
[time=2322] We know that if a dog has an offspring, it's a dog.
[time=2325] And if a human has an offspring, it is a human.
[time=2328] And if God has a son, then God's son is just like him, he's God.
[time=2333] But we also know it biblically.
[time=2335] Because on another occasion, when Jesus referred to himself as the Son of God and he looked at heaven and called God his fathers, his enemies bent down.
[time=2344] They picked up stones and they were ready to stone him to death.
[time=2347] And Jesus said, "For what good deed do you stone me?" And they said, "For no good deed do we stone you." But because you, being a man, make yourself equal to God by calling God your father.
[time=2363] Don't water it down because you can't mix the oil of the deity of Christ with the water of the wisdom of man.
[time=2371] He was God.
[time=2374] At the University of Akron where I attended school, one of my professors stood up in a class that was called Western Cultural Traditions, talked about religion and said emphatically, "Jesus never claimed to be God." Hundreds of years after Jesus died, his followers tacked that title on to him.
[time=2394] Let's see if my professor was right.
[time=2397] Here's a question.
[time=2398] Who do you say that I am?
[time=2400] Here's the answer. You are God. Let's see how Jesus answered it.
[time=2404] Did he confirm it or did he deny it?
[time=2409] Verse 17.
[time=2412] Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my father, who is in heaven."
[time=2428] The question? Who do you think that I am?
[time=2431] The answer? You are God. Jesus' response is this.
[time=2435] You are absolutely right.
[time=2438] This phrase, "Blessed are you" could be paraphrased in modern English to say, "Right on."
[time=2445] When Jesus said, "Blessed are you," he was saying, "You are right on."
[time=2451] And then he takes that and he underlines it twice.
[time=2454] He underlines it first by saying, "You are right, Simon, son of John."
[time=2461] Why did he include that in there? Because he was making a parallel statement.
[time=2466] Peter had just said, "You are the son of God. I know your origin."
[time=2472] And Jesus was saying, "You are the son of Jonah. I know your origin." By calling me the son of God, you are absolutely right.
[time=2479] It's called parallelism. It's a way of emphasizing in literature.
[time=2483] The second way Jesus underlines it is this. He says, "Peter, you're bright, but you're not that bright.
[time=2488] You're smart, but you're not that smart. This thought didn't come to you by any form of human insight.
[time=2494] You didn't come to the conclusion on your own, and no one else gave it to you on earth.
[time=2499] But that insight that I am God originated from my father in heaven, and you are absolutely right.
[time=2507] But not only did he say that he was right, Jesus went on to confirm it with several more statements.
[time=2514] He also said this statement, "You are Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my church."
[time=2528] Jesus said that he was about to build his church, and that this church would withstand anything.
[time=2539] There would not be any human force. There would not be any natural force.
[time=2548] There would not be any social force. And there would not be any demonic force.
[time=2552] Nothing on earth or something coming out of the gates of hell itself would be able to stand against Christ
[time=2559] and the building of his church.
[time=2563] And then we come to this statement, "You are Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my church."
[time=2571] There are three different interpretations of what it is that Jesus said was the rock on which he would build his church.
[time=2578] Interpretation number one, "The rock is Jesus." Peter said, "You are the Christ, and it is Christ who is the rock of the church."
[time=2589] Interpretation number two, it's not Christ, but it's Peter's confession of Christ.
[time=2595] It is the statement, "You are the Christ." The third opinion is that the rock is Peter, and my opinion is clearly and unequivocally all three of them are right.
[time=2608] That's not because I'm running for political office. I said that in April of 1987.
[time=2614] It was a famous politician who was put on the spot, and he said, "What are you going to do about this situation?"
[time=2620] There's so much turmoil, and he said, "Well, some of my friends are against it, and I want you to know that I am for my friends."
[time=2629] Well, I'm not trying to do that to you today, but there's an element of truth in each of those three lines of reasoning.
[time=2636] First and foremost, if you learn nothing, learn this, that Jesus is the cornerstone.
[time=2644] He is the rock, and my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=2650] I dare not trust the sweetest fame, but holy lean on Jesus' name. On Christ, the solid rock I stand, he is the rock.
[time=2661] But for you to have a piece of the rock, you've got to come to the personal confession that Peter didn't say.
[time=2670] Yes, Jesus is the Christ, and that's how you get a piece of the rock by your personal confession that he is the rock.
[time=2679] And I think the third thing is true, because there was a significant play on words here.
[time=2684] Now, you've got to picture the background. They're in Caesarea.
[time=2689] Caesarea Philippi is 1,150 feet above sea level. It's perched up upon a rock, and sits at the foot of Mount Herman.
[time=2700] And with that backdrop of a huge rock, Jesus said thou art petros. That means a rock.
[time=2710] And upon this rock, petro, that means a rock. I will build my church.
[time=2719] Peter isn't big enough, he's just petros. Jesus said I'm going to build my church on petro.
[time=2725] But also know this, I really believe that Jesus was saying, is I am going to build my church on the rock of who I am.
[time=2734] People are going to have a piece of the rock by coming to faith in who I am.
[time=2738] But Peter, I'm going to build my church out of men and women just like you, people who are a piece of the rock.
[time=2747] And when Jesus started calling him Peter, it was just like us calling someone today, Rocky.
[time=2757] And so, if you're ever quizzed in the Bible, this man's actual name in English is Rocky Johnson, Rocky the son of John or Jonah.
[time=2768] And what Jesus was saying is confirmed by the disciples in Ephesians where the Bible tells us that the Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets.
[time=2782] They're part of that rock foundation, but Jesus Christ, he is the cornerstone.
[time=2789] And this church, Jesus promised that he would build it and the gates of hell would not prevail against it.
[time=2798] Then Jesus took it a little further and he said I'm going to give to you the keys of the kingdom.
[time=2806] Keys represent two things, they represent a trust and they represent authority.
[time=2814] These are the keys to our church, this to the north building on state and this to the worship center we're in right now.
[time=2821] These keys were given to me as a trust.
[time=2825] I'm allowed to come in and out of these buildings whenever I want to, I'm trusted.
[time=2830] But also with that trust came the responsibility that I didn't come into the building and say boy, we could use a refrigerator, I'll just haul this one out of the kitchen home.
[time=2839] Boy, it'd be nice to have some whole movies, I'll just wheel the Bible, our camera's home.
[time=2843] But with these came a trust of popular, proper use.
[time=2848] With these also came authority, we don't give these out to just everybody.
[time=2853] I've been here 13 years and two months ago I got these keys.
[time=2857] (Laughter) But the key represents authority, our building is well keyed, there are certain keys that will get you into the front door but not into offices.
[time=2868] There are other keys that will get you into the front door and into the outer offices but not the inner offices.
[time=2873] There are keys that will open every door.
[time=2876] Peter was given a key.
[time=2878] The key that he carried was not cut out of metal but it was the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2884] And he was to take the key of the gospel and he was to preach it.
[time=2887] And wherever he preached it a door would be open.
[time=2890] And if he failed to open the door it would never be open.
[time=2895] So Peter preached the gospel to a group of Hebrew brothers and sisters on the day of Pentecost and the door was open.
[time=2903] Then Peter preached the gospel to a group of Samaritans and the door was open to those who were half Gentile and half Jewish.
[time=2910] And then in Acts chapters 10 and 11 Peter opened the last door so that every Gentile could come in.
[time=2917] But you know what? Peter wasn't the only one with the keys.
[time=2922] Lots of people have keys to this church and almost everybody knows how to find a key.
[time=2928] A friend called and said, "I want to use some of the books out of your library." He said, "All right." And I said, "Sure." But the church is locked.
[time=2934] He said, "Well, do you want me to come over and get your key or do you want me to use the key that you have here outside your office that everybody knows about?"
[time=2943] And I said, "Well, just go ahead and use the one that everybody knows about." And you know what? The keys to the gospel are for everybody.
[time=2952] Not just one man, not just one officer, but for everybody.
[time=2957] Jesus Christ, He holds the keys and He says, "I want you to hold the keys and open the door of heaven, preach the gospel."
[time=2970] Jesus made this promise, "I will build my church."
[time=2978] Second thing I want to say to you this morning is this, Jesus has already built His church.
[time=2985] Whatever you do, don't understand this steel structure covered by brick and block is not the church.
[time=2996] The church is not its property. The church is its people.
[time=3002] Almost every day someone says to me, "I saw your new church." And I graciously try not to offend them, but correct them. First of all, it's not my church.
[time=3013] And secondly, I want to know where they saw my church.
[time=3016] Oh, I saw it at the corner of state and lame-ire. That's not the church.
[time=3021] Our church are the men and women who work at Magnavox.
[time=3024] Our church are the lawyers and the doctors who work in the offices of Fort Wayne.
[time=3028] Our church are the people who work on the assembly lines at General Motors and in Dana and Ray Magnetwire.
[time=3034] Our church are the salesman and the struckbrokers, the secretaries, the moms and dads who live on the streets and the cul-de-sacs of Fort Wayne.
[time=3042] The people are the church. The building is not the church.
[time=3049] And God has been building His church here, year after year after year.
[time=3057] When I think of the church, I think of the men and women's lives who have been changed.
[time=3061] And as I look out across this auditorium at this very hour, I can see more than a few people whose lives have been hooked on drugs
[time=3069] who've come to obedience to Jesus Christ and have been rebuilt, and that's the church.
[time=3076] Oh, I hope you were here two Sunday nights ago when John gave his testimony of how he had known about Christ. He had grown up and he'd heard all of it, but he went into the drug culture, but he's given his heart to Christ.
[time=3088] And now he wants to become a youth pastor. That is the church.
[time=3093] Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did.
[time=3098] The church or the men like Tom. Tom was a Bible hour viewer who wrote in from a state prison.
[time=3108] He said, "I'm here in prison in Michigan City and I watched the Bible hour and I wanted you to know that this week I asked Jesus Christ into my heart." That is the church.
[time=3120] But the best letter was the one that Tom wrote a few months after that when he wrote back and said, "I just wanted you to know that I've gathered an audience to watch the Bible hour with me and you're a grandpa. I was 31 at the time." He said, "Because today I led somebody else to Christ."
[time=3140] That's the church. Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did.
[time=3149] The church are the men and women who have gone through the hardest times of life, and I think of Jean McCoy. Jean taught evangelism, explosion, hearing.
[time=3158] He knew he had a bad heart and he died teaching the class that he loved.
[time=3163] That's the church. And his wife Judy, a single adult, raised a daughter on her own after Jean's death,
[time=3173] and she comes here week by week and she serves and she worships.
[time=3177] That's the church. Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did.
[time=3187] The churches are the John sutches and the Tim All-Wines, those young guys that come through this building
[time=3193] and while they're here, they accept Christ and they follow Him fully.
[time=3197] And now John's a pastor in Wallen and Tim's a pastor and a boy.
[time=3201] That's the church when Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did.
[time=3211] The church are the Mary cruises who have gone to Japan.
[time=3216] The Mike and Carolyn Ballas who will not return home from Manila, even though there are bombs bursting in air over their house.
[time=3224] The church is the Lori E.B. Huns who are working with students in California schools
[time=3230] and the Jim Seer Stads up in Minnesota and the Mary Ann Gandalfo is all who came to know Christ because of people here. And now you've sent them out and you support them as missionaries.
[time=3241] That is the church. And Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did.
[time=3254] The church is a group of men and women who gather to pray on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings, and who pray for people to come to Christ, and who for years prayed for a friend named Joe, and a friend named Don,
[time=3270] and a friend named Norm, and Norm accepted Christ, and Don accepted Christ,
[time=3276] and Joe accepted Christ, and every one of those men have made public their faith in Jesus Christ
[time=3282] in this building, and that is the church.
[time=3287] And Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did.
[time=3296] The church are the men and women who serve in the shadows.
[time=3301] I stand under the floodlights. They work administrating the business office,
[time=3309] administrating the school, running the youth ministry, running the associate pastoral responsibilities, running the music.
[time=3319] They are the ones that God uses to build the church.
[time=3326] The church are the men who have served as elders who have never received pay
[time=3333] other than to hear their Lord say, "Well done, now good and faithful servant." They are the church.
[time=3340] The church are the deacons and their wives who, with their hands, provide the meals and take them to homes and babysit children and visit in the hospital.
[time=3349] They are the church.
[time=3354] The church is the volunteers who work in the nursery, who usher, who operate a camera, who sit behind the scenes in the toddler Sunday school, who work on a computer, who volunteer to stuff an envelope, who help to build a living Christmas tree.
[time=3367] They are the church.
[time=3369] And Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did.
[time=3377] The final thing I want to say to you this morning is this.
[time=3381] Jesus said, "I will build my church," and he did, but he's not done yet.
[time=3388] Although we have had these years together of sharing the gospel, of reaching out to the loss, of trying to feed the hungry through the living Christmas tree, of trying to shelter the homeless through the work of the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission, of helping those in the crisis of pregnancy through the crisis pregnancy center, we have not yet won this world the Christ.
[time=3411] And the greatest lesson I have learned in my spiritual life is one that I've tried to teach you again, and again, and again.
[time=3420] It is this simple lesson.
[time=3424] It is too soon to quit.
[time=3429] I remember David Burnham standing in the pulpit at the Chapel University Park, telling you about a football coach who would go back and forth on the sidelines when a team thought they were about to be beat.
[time=3441] He would just say, "Man, it's too soon to quit.
[time=3443] All that echoes in my ears." And I remember wanting to quit a job at a camp because I thought I'd been mistreated, and David said, "Rick, it's too soon to quit." May my last words to this church, as your pastor be, this simple statement.
[time=3464] Jesus said, "I will build my church." He has built his church, and he's not done yet, and it is too soon to quit.
[time=3475] Oh, God today, be glorified in this place, in these people who are your church,
[time=3484] not for our sake, but for your sake.
[time=3488] Jesus be glorified. Amen.
[time=3493] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir,
[time=3501] soloist Kathy Hawks, and reflection.
[time=3504] The message today was the final message for our pastor, Rick Hawks.
[time=3509] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3517] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that you sent your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3525] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3528] I ask you to come in, and forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my savior today.
[time=3535] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3539] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3543] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3552] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the study booklet entitled, "Great is the Lord," please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
