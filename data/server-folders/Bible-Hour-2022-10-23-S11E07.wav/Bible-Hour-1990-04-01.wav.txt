[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=60] There are few things in life which, with, there is greater difficulty to cope than change.
[time=73] The average person changes their residents at least ten times in their lifetime.
[time=78] They change their occupation five times.
[time=81] They change their shirt every day and they change their opinion about every other moment.
[time=87] [MUSIC]
[time=97] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=102] Thank you for joining us.
[time=104] Rick's message today is entitled "Courage in Changing Times." Change is one of the most, if not the most, difficult situation with which to cope.
[time=113] It is traumatic for a school child to have a change of teacher in the middle of a school year.
[time=118] It is difficult for an adult to cope with a change at work when a new boss takes over and it can be trying for a church when a leader leaves.
[time=127] Today Rick's message is designed to be a reference point in days of change.
[time=132] Open your Bible with us to Joshua 1 and study along for today's lesson entitled "Courage in Changing Times."
[time=140] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=144] Rick's text is taken from the book of Joshua 1 verses 1 through 9.
[time=149] Our special music today will be provided by our special guests, Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=156] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a number entitled "There is Power."
[time=164] [MUSIC - 251 seconds]
[time=420] (audience applauds)
[time=431] - That's the message that we proclaim that indeed, because Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins and rose again, there is indeed power in his blood.
[time=443] I mentioned in the first service that Rick Hawks has improved considerably over the years in his singing, and while he does well here, when we all get to heaven, perhaps he'll even be leading the choir.
[time=454] (audience laughs) I also suggested that I wouldn't be preaching.
[time=458] (audience laughs) Him number 542, please, let's sing enthusiastically in anticipation of that day when we meet together in heaven.
[time=467] 542, we'll sing the first, third, and fourths stands us together.
[time=472] (orchestral music)
[time=502] (singing in foreign language)
[time=562] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language)
[time=597] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) Amen, thank you for your good singing.
[time=623] We are always grateful when we have people that were formerly from Black Hawk Baptist Church come back and minister to us.
[time=630] We still claim Steve and Maria Gardner as our dear friends and even a part of this church, although they've been in Fresno, California for a number of years.
[time=639] We're delighted that they're here today to minister to us.
[time=642] I apologize that the bulletin says Steve and Maria will be singing, but really it's Mandy Gardner with Steve and Maria.
[time=651] Mandy has grown up quite a bit and we're just delighted to see her and see how beautiful she is.
[time=656] She's joined them to sing on several of the numbers they'll be singing this morning.
[time=660] We're just delighted to have Steve and Maria Gardner here this weekend at Fort Wayne and at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=666] Welcome.
[time=667] Thank you, Pete.
[time=668] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 132 seconds]
[time=809] [APPLAUSE]
[time=817] I'm sure you've already enjoyed the Ministry of Music, provided by Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=823] It is great to have old friends back.
[time=825] That's right, Rick, they've been gone for a number of years now, but we're regular attenders and in fact, members of our church for a number of years.
[time=832] They now live in California and we do welcome them back to Blackhawk for this special day.
[time=838] And in a few moments, you'll have the privilege of hearing them sing again, but we want to take just a brief moment to tell you of some coming events that we want you to be a part of.
[time=847] On Friday the 13th, that sounds a little suspicious, doesn't it, Friday the 13th?
[time=852] But in April, on Friday the 13th will be Good Friday, and we are hosting a Good Friday service in the heart of our city at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=863] It will be conducted over the lunch hour from 1215 to 1245.
[time=868] We move into the Grand Wayne Center so that all of the community can come to one central spot so that people working in the downtown area can just walk in over their lunch hour, and that is a great opportunity for you to come on Good Friday and worship the Lord Jesus Christ with us.
[time=884] So we hope you'll take advantage of that, and then we'll have our special Easter service on Easter morning.
[time=889] I know you're working hard on music for that day.
[time=892] We have a great day planned for Sunday morning, April 15th.
[time=895] A lot of music that day that reflects actually starts kind of with Jesus' triumphal entry into the city a week before his death and resurrection, and then some of the pathos and the sorrow that was experienced, as people changed, they were rooting for him for one day, and just seems like a couple days later, they were hollering crucify and crucify him, and that's very poignant and very important part of the history of what Christ did for us.
[time=924] And then we will talk, however, not only about that death and sing about the grand resurrection, which is the combination of everything that Jesus stood for and the reason that He came to earth to die for our sins.
[time=936] So there will be some beautiful music and some resurrection spirit that will be there.
[time=941] Well, we hope you'll set those dates aside, and if you do not have a church home, make every effort to join us here at Black Hog for Good Friday at the Grand Wayne Center and for Easter Sunday morning right here in our worship center.
[time=954] Today we have a booklet to share with you on the greatness of our God.
[time=958] We've titled it, "Great is the Lord." One of the joys of my life has been the opportunity to dig into God's Word, study it, and prepare this booklet for you.
[time=968] In this booklet we talk about evidence so that we have a reason to demonstrate to a watching world why we believe God exists.
[time=976] We study through the details of what is God like, that He's omniscient, He knows everything, that He's omnipotent, that He's all powerful, that He's omnipresent, He's everywhere.
[time=987] It's very much of a study, but it's very practical as well.
[time=991] And we want to give you a copy if you'll simply write to us and ask for it.
[time=996] You can receive a copy of this helpful booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1008] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1017] Thank you, Pete, and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1022] If perchance you have missed the past two weeks, I've been sharing an announcement that I would like to repeat for our television viewers today.
[time=1029] A few weeks ago, I offered my resignation to the Board of Elders of our church, and it was accepted.
[time=1036] I have resigned as the pastor of Blackhawk Baptist Church and as the voice of the Bible Hour.
[time=1041] I have done that in order to seek the Republican nomination as a congressman for the 4th Congressional District of Indiana.
[time=1049] I believe it would be inappropriate for me to stay in a church in a pulpit and on a television ministry while seeking public office.
[time=1056] So my last Sunday is a part of this wonderful church and great television ministry will be next Sunday.
[time=1062] We will record one week and play at the next week, but the last Sunday I will be in the pulpit is Sunday morning, March the 25th.
[time=1070] I want to thank you for your letters, your support, your encouragement over all the years that we've shared this ministry together.
[time=1077] And more than anything else, I hope you'll dedicate yourself to keeping Blackhawk strong and keeping the Bible Hour strong.
[time=1084] Rick, we're deeply grateful for the amount of years and the time that you've spent at Blackhawk Baptist Church, and we want to invite those of you that are a regular part of the Bible Hour to come and join us on Sunday evening, March 25th for us Farewell Service for Rick and Kathy Hawks.
[time=1102] That'll be right here in the worship center at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1106] If you're watching this and you have time to come and you'd like to show your appreciation to Rick and Kathy, join us that evening at 6 p.m. again.
[time=1114] That's March 25th Sunday evening at 6 p.m.
[time=1117] for our Farewell Service for Rick and Kathy Hawks.
[time=1121] We do appreciate them, we love them, we wish them well in their continuing efforts to run for Congress, that'll be exciting time for them.
[time=1130] We go back to our live service now and join Stephen Maria Gardner as they sing for us.
[time=1152] [MUSIC - 219 seconds]
[time=1376] We so much appreciated being back home here this weekend and turning on the television early this morning and seeing the Bible hour and hearing Rick's message of last week about discouragement and doubt.
[time=1388] How much we're thankful for the fact that God knows our emotions, he knows our needs, he knows when we feel alone, he can take our honesty, he is a rescuing God.
[time=1405] Oh Lord, my soul longs for you, in this my time of great need.
[time=1417] I fear you have left me alone.
[time=1423] There is no one who cares who can answer my prayers.
[time=1429] Lord, I feel I am sinking like stone.
[time=1435] But Lord, you've promised to hear when I cry out in prayer, when I search for you with all my might.
[time=1445] So please hear me now in this hour of despair.
[time=1450] Turn light darkness into your light, you are a rescuing God, you are a saving Lord, and you delight in the sound of your children's faith.
[time=1462] You are a rescuing God, you are a saving Lord, and I will praise your name through all my days.
[time=1470] Oh Lord, my eyes can now see, the sin that I've hidden from you, the price that it's caused me to pay, all the pain and despair, even sickness to bear, and the shame and reproach of this day.
[time=1498] But now I open my heart and I humbly repent of the sin I've committed against you.
[time=1508] And for the time that I have so foolishly spent in hiding from your holy view, you are a rescuing God, you are a saving Lord, and you delight in the sound of your children's faith.
[time=1525] You are a rescuing God, you are a saving Lord, and I will praise your name through all my days.
[time=1531] You are a rescuing God, you are a saving Lord, and you delight in the sound of your children's faith.
[time=1538] You are a rescuing God, you are a saving Lord, and I will praise your name through all my days.
[time=1545] And I will praise your name through all my days.
[time=1553] Oh praise your name.
[time=1555] Thank you, Stephen Maria, and God we thank you that you are a rescuing God.
[time=1568] And we ask you today to take our hearts and to rescue us from the pain and the sorrow of loved ones lost.
[time=1577] We ask you to take our hearts and to rescue us from the preoccupation of money and how we'll acquire it and how we'll spend it and how we'll invest it.
[time=1587] We ask you as our rescuing God to rescue our hearts from our own appetites, we ask you as our rescuing God to take our hearts and to rescue us from the emotional burdens and turmoil that hold us hostage, enemies like bitterness, anger and resentment, lack of self-esteem and self-depreciation.
[time=1610] Oh God rescue us today, by your word give us principles that will give insight for living, give us food and not just milk but meat, give us strength and courage as we face uncertain days.
[time=1625] We ask you to be a clear light in the sheer direction.
[time=1629] Thank you for reunions today that Ken and Marlene Nichols could be here, that Steve and Maria and Mandy could be back.
[time=1637] We are grateful. Thank you for old friends and new faces.
[time=1642] Thank you for the inspiration that comes when we lift up your name and then we get lifted up.
[time=1648] We love you and ask you about your spirit to work in our hearts.
[time=1653] We pray like David created me a clean heart, oh God, renew a right spirit within me and restore unto us the joy of our salvation.
[time=1663] Direct our lives now, we ask it in these changing times for Jesus' sake, amen.
[time=1672] There is little, if not nothing at all, that is more difficult with which to cope than that of change.
[time=1680] Someone has said that the average American changes their residence every ten years, their employment every seven years,
[time=1688] their car every three years, their shirt every day and their mind every other minute.
[time=1695] I don't know if you're that prone to change but I am going through a lot of changes and I know that you are.
[time=1701] And some of those changes I'm coping with very well, others of those, I'm not coping with them so well.
[time=1707] For seven years I have driven a white car.
[time=1711] I came out of a meeting the other day, I walked right over to where I had parked my white car and it was gone.
[time=1717] And I thought and I retraced my steps and I knew that I parked here and it had to be in one of these three places.
[time=1724] My white car was gone and I was thinking, how do you call the police and say someone has stolen my car?
[time=1730] And as I paced back and forth, I remembered I don't have a white car anymore, I changed, I have a red car and it was right there where I parked it.
[time=1738] I don't know how you're coping with change, some of them I'm just handling like that and then those big decisions are like,
[time=1745] what colors my car I'm struggling with from time to time.
[time=1749] Change is one of the hardest things to cope with in life.
[time=1754] And I think one of the biggest changes in history occurred in Joshua chapter one.
[time=1760] So if you have a Bible this morning, I invite you to open it to Joshua chapter one.
[time=1765] Let me read for you the first nine verses.
[time=1770] After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, the son of none, Moses aid.
[time=1780] Moses my servant is dead.
[time=1783] Now then you and all these people get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I'm about to give them to the Israelites.
[time=1793] I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.
[time=1800] Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, from the great river of the Euphrates all the way to the Hittite country, to the great sea on the west.
[time=1811] No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life.
[time=1815] As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will never leave you. I will not forsake you.
[time=1825] Be strong and courageous because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.
[time=1835] Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you.
[time=1844] Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful whatever you do.
[time=1855] Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth but meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.
[time=1865] Then you will be prosperous and successful. How am I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous.
[time=1872] Do not be terrified. Do not be discouraged. For the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
[time=1882] Before I give you three principles allow me to give you the situation.
[time=1887] Moses has led a group of slaves, out of Egypt.
[time=1893] He has demonstrated God's blessing with miracle after miracle when they were pinned with the Egyptian army pressing them against the Red Sea.
[time=1904] God worked through Moses and the Red Sea opened and the Israelites scurried through safe and then the wall of water crashed down on the enemy.
[time=1913] Moses was a dynamic leader. Moses went up on top of the mountain and he descended from that mountain not only with two tablets of stones, the Ten Commandments,
[time=1926] but his face reflecting the Shekinah glory of the Lord. He was a dynamic leader.
[time=1933] For 40 years these people had followed him through the desert. Moses had provided the water. Moses had provided the food.
[time=1943] Moses had provided the courage and the insight and the strength and now you come to this phrase.
[time=1950] Read it with it's dripping finality. Moses is dead.
[time=1959] If you've lost a loved one you understand the echoing ramifications of that single sentence. Moses is dead.
[time=1972] It's not that Moses is retired. It's not that Moses is on a leave of absence. It's not that Moses will be back after a holiday.
[time=1982] He is dead. He is gone. We will never see his face. We will never hear his voice.
[time=1990] We will never be able to draw on the wisdom of one who lived 120 years and died with his eye still being bright and his arm being strong.
[time=2002] He is gone. For 40 years he had led these people and this is the only leader they have ever known and he is gone.
[time=2016] In the verses that follow that gripping statement I believe that there are three very practical principles for us.
[time=2025] Let me give them to you. Principles we live by. Courage for changing times.
[time=2032] Principle number one is this. Assume your responsibilities. I've heard people saying I'm sure their intentions were right.
[time=2041] Just let go and let God. I don't know how to do that and I don't know when you're supposed to do that.
[time=2048] I like the old Arabic proverb that says trust in the Lord but tie up your own camel. I think that's good advice.
[time=2057] We are to be responsible to assume our responsibilities and that's what this passage teaches.
[time=2067] God teaches them three ways that they're to assume their responsibilities. Here's responsibility number one. Hard work.
[time=2076] If you look at verses two and three it says this. Moses my servant is dead.
[time=2084] Now then you and all these people get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land.
[time=2090] Now notice this that I'm about to give to them. Merry Christmas.
[time=2094] God's going to hand over to you the land wrapped up in a package with a bow on it and all you have to do is untie the string.
[time=2101] Wrong. I will give you every place where you set your foot.
[time=2110] It wasn't signed sealed and delivered. They couldn't just simply let go and let God.
[time=2116] God said I'm going to give it to you but you've got to take it and they had to go eyeball to eyeball with the city of Jericho.
[time=2124] They had to go sword to sword with the city of AI and they had to go spear to spear with the Gibeonites.
[time=2132] I don't know about you but that's not exactly what I call a gift.
[time=2138] It's what we call in theological words the law of appropriation or the divine cooperative.
[time=2148] That God says I will do for you what you can't do for yourself but I will not do for you what you can do for yourself.
[time=2159] God says I'm going to give you the land now you get out there and take it.
[time=2165] For these people to go through the times of transition and the days of change they had to assume their responsibility and their first responsibility was hard work.
[time=2177] God was not simply handing them the land but you know God did that in his wisdom.
[time=2183] He said you have to go in and conquer the land because if I drive all the inhabitants out then the land will go to waste before you can occupy it.
[time=2192] So I'm going to drive them out one at a time and they'll keep the property values up until you're ready to move in.
[time=2198] You've got to take it hard work.
[time=2202] There's a story told about this pastor who hitched up his horse to his buggy.
[time=2206] Took a buggy ride out and was visiting his parishioners in the country.
[time=2210] He came by one of his parishioners and they had the most beautiful farm you can imagine.
[time=2216] I mean his fields were lush and weedless, his barns were painted, his fences were whitewashed, his silos were full, his yard was trimmed.
[time=2226] It was gorgeous. The pastor looked at the farmer and said this is a beautiful farm you and the Lord have here.
[time=2236] The farmer said sure is and you should have seen this place when it was just the Lord's.
[time=2244] That's the divine cooperative.
[time=2247] God doesn't whitewash fences, he doesn't paint barns, he doesn't plant fields, he doesn't weed or harvest.
[time=2254] But he gives us the strength to do everything we need to do and then he does for us what we can't do.
[time=2262] There's a balance in this law of appropriation, in this concept of divine cooperation.
[time=2269] Charles Haddon Spurgeon, the great preacher of a century ago, said I work like it's all up to me and I pray like it's all up to God.
[time=2277] I don't think it can be put any better than that.
[time=2281] But we have to assume our responsibilities and the first one of those is hard work.
[time=2287] You know when change takes place, it's very easy to become discouraged or to be filled with doubts or to be burdened by things aren't the way I wanted them to be.
[time=2298] What happens is with the change comes discouragement.
[time=2301] With the discouragement comes inactivity.
[time=2304] With inactivity comes more problems, with more problems comes more discouragement, with more discouragement comes more inactivity, with more inactivity comes more problems, with more problems comes an even greater amount of discouragement.
[time=2317] With an even greater amount of discouragement comes less activity, with less activity comes more and we get caught in this cycle and it all starts if we think this is supposed to be easy, this is supposed to be automatic, this is supposed to be the way it always was or the way I dreamed it would be.
[time=2333] It's going to take hard work in the days of transition.
[time=2337] Some of you are serving faithfully and you can turn down your hearing aid right now.
[time=2343] When I go like this, I want you to turn it back up though.
[time=2346] If you're not serving, find a place to serve in this church.
[time=2350] The urgent need for somebody to teach children today, this hour, find Linda Pearson, sign up on the back of a card and say, "I'll help with children Sunday school."
[time=2360] There's a need for nursery workers and we pay combat bonus to those who work in the nursery.
[time=2366] Sign up and help out.
[time=2368] We need ushers.
[time=2370] We need people to work in the office as volunteers.
[time=2373] We need people to visit the people who visited Blackhawk in evangelism explosion.
[time=2379] Work hard.
[time=2381] Give faithfully and generously to this church that you call home.
[time=2386] Assume your responsibilities.
[time=2388] The first one is the work hard.
[time=2391] Responsibility number two is found in three different phrases.
[time=2396] Repeated.
[time=2397] Verse six says, "Be strong and courageous." Verse seven says, "Be strong and very courageous." Verse nine, "Have I not commanded you?
[time=2411] Be strong and courageous." Now let me give you a little wow factor today.
[time=2416] Having studied two plus years of Hebrew, let me tell you what this phrase means.
[time=2421] It means, "Be strong and very courageous." Isn't that a deep insight?
[time=2428] If nothing else get from the fact that God repeated it three times, how important it is that we be strong.
[time=2435] That means that we are planted.
[time=2437] We are rooted.
[time=2438] We are firm.
[time=2439] Courageous means from that position we are alert and poised for action.
[time=2445] Our second responsibility in the days of change are to be courageous.
[time=2452] You may not feel courageous, but if you think about being courageous, then you will act courageously and then you will become courageous.
[time=2462] It's simply a matter of think, act, and become.
[time=2465] My favorite story of all time, this lion is prancing his way through the jungle with his head high and his chest extended
[time=2472] and he comes into the face of the hugest ape in the jungle.
[time=2476] And he roars right in his face and he says, "Why aren't you the king of the jungle?" The big ape drops his head in embarrassment and runs off and hides in the weeds.
[time=2486] The lion moves his way through the jungle and he comes right into the face of a huge rhinoceros
[time=2492] and puts his nose right on his single horn and roars and says, "Why aren't you the king of the jungle?"
[time=2499] The rhino drops his head and runs and hides in the cave.
[time=2502] The lion pranced his way through the jungle, intimidating one animal after another and they all ran in flat
[time=2509] until he came to this little mouse.
[time=2511] And he roared into the face of the mouse and he said, "Why aren't you the king of the jungle?" The little mouse said, "Because I've been sick."
[time=2523] There's a little critter who thought courageously.
[time=2527] And when he thought courageously, he acted courageously and he became courageous.
[time=2533] If you start thinking strong and thinking courageous, if you'll venture into the deep water,
[time=2539] if you'll climb the high mountains, if you'll tackle the big obstacles with strength and courage, you will not only think about being courageous, you will act courageously and you will be courageous
[time=2550] and you'll back down the lines that want to roar in your face.
[time=2556] Our second responsibility is this one.
[time=2560] It is to be courageous.
[time=2564] Have courage.
[time=2566] The third responsibility we have is this one.
[time=2569] Hold on to our principles.
[time=2576] Allow me again to direct you to verse 7.
[time=2578] It says, "Be strong and very courageous.
[time=2581] Be careful to obey the law.
[time=2588] Be careful to obey the law my servant Moses gave you.
[time=2593] Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left hand that you may be successful wherever you go.
[time=2598] Do not let this book or the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it." Third responsibility we must have in changing times is as everything else changes, we don't.
[time=2614] Our character is the same and our principles are the same.
[time=2618] He gives an excellent reference point.
[time=2621] Hold on to God's word and don't turn to the right and don't turn to the left.
[time=2629] In the days of transition are the times when many people want to get their hand to the helm
[time=2636] and they want to steer the ship.
[time=2638] There will be those that will say, "You know this church has never been strong and they've got their own little agenda.
[time=2642] One, two, three, four." Boy, we've got a correct liberalism in the church right now.
[time=2646] Boy, we're going to go after these things and we're going to steer this thing back over here more conservatively where it needs to be.
[time=2653] There are going to be other people going to say, "You know this church has always been a little bit too rigid for me.
[time=2658] A little too legalistic." Boy, you know what we need to do is loosen things up here and we've got to steer this ship a little bit to the left.
[time=2665] Simply steer the ship according to the word.
[time=2671] Steer it according to the word. It says, "Moses, my servant is dead."
[time=2680] It doesn't say, "So remember everything that Moses did and do it exactly the way Moses did it."
[time=2688] It says, "Moses is dead. Do it the way I have said it in the book of the law."
[time=2696] And he unfolds for us how we're to approach this.
[time=2700] He says that we are to do three things with this book.
[time=2704] First of all, we are to meditate on it.
[time=2709] By meditate, it means give more than casual reading.
[time=2712] It even means more than academic study.
[time=2715] It means to study with the purpose of self-application.
[time=2721] If I meditate on a verse, I read it and say, "What does it say?" Then if I meditate on it, I read it again and I say, "What does it mean to me?" Then I read it again and I say, "How can I weave that into the fabric of my life today?" That's meditation.
[time=2737] First thing we're to do is we're to meditate on it.
[time=2739] Secondly, we're to not allow it to depart from our mouth.
[time=2744] We are to speak of it day and night.
[time=2749] Talking about God's word reinforces it not only in the ears of the ones hearing it,
[time=2755] but in the heart of the ones speaking it.
[time=2758] We are to teach it to our children, teach it to our family, teach it to our friends.
[time=2762] We are to make it the issue of our life.
[time=2766] And thirdly, we are to do it.
[time=2770] Meditate in it, talk about it so that you may be careful to do according to all that's written there in.
[time=2778] You see, it's not how much are you into the word, it's how much is the word into you.
[time=2783] It's not what do you know, but what do you do with what you know.
[time=2788] You see, I know an awful lot about how much to eat and how much not to eat.
[time=2795] But in about one hour, we're going out to lunch with some friends at a nice buffet.
[time=2800] And for an hour, I will have amnesia and I will forget everything I know about what is healthy
[time=2806] and what are the right amounts.
[time=2809] So then it doesn't matter what I know, if I don't act on what I know.
[time=2814] It doesn't matter whether you know how many kings there were in Israel and how many kings there were in Judah and which one died first.
[time=2822] If you don't know the lives of Godly men and how to form your life after their pattern.
[time=2829] We have to be people who hold on to our principles.
[time=2834] We are to meditate on it, we are to talk about it, and most of all, we are to walk it.
[time=2843] Principle number one is this, assume your responsibility.
[time=2850] Three of them.
[time=2852] Principle number one, assume your responsibility.
[time=2855] They are hard work, have courage, hold on to your principles.
[time=2860] Here's the second principle, access your resources.
[time=2866] Access your resources.
[time=2869] Dale Carnegie in one of his books tells the story of Hedy Green.
[time=2873] Hedy Green lived in absolute poverty.
[time=2875] She made a few pennies to live off of by collecting rags out of other people's trash than sorting them
[time=2881] because she got a few pennies more for a rag that was white having never been dyed than a rag that had color in it from previous dies.
[time=2889] She took a trip across the Midwest on a train, couldn't afford the price of a sleeper, couldn't afford the price of a seat and stood the whole way.
[time=2901] When Hedy Green died, they went into her impoverished home and found in her possession a sizable number of stocks and bonds,
[time=2911] and she literally was a major shareholder in the railroad that she stood up on the car to ride to Chicago.
[time=2921] She had all kinds of resources, but she didn't know it and she didn't access them.
[time=2927] This passage tells us of our two greatest resources and to access them.
[time=2934] Resource number one is the presence of God. Look at verse five.
[time=2940] As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
[time=2947] I will never leave you nor forsake you.
[time=2953] God says, I will be with you.
[time=2958] Isaac was afraid in a foreign country and God said, Isaac, don't be afraid.
[time=2963] I am with you.
[time=2965] Jacob was afraid when his brother sold him into slavery and he was shipped off to Egypt and God said, Joseph, don't be afraid.
[time=2972] I am with you.
[time=2974] Gideon was called by God to fight the entire army of the medianites with 300 men and God said, don't be afraid.
[time=2982] Gideon, I am with you.
[time=2986] Jeremiah, the prophet was pushed up against his will to speak to the people and God said, don't be afraid of their faces.
[time=2992] I am afraid of their faces, for I am with you.
[time=2997] Shadmak, Meshach and Abednego went into the fiery furnace because they knew that God said, I will be with you.
[time=3011] Jesus' last words before his ascension to heaven were these.
[time=3018] Behold, I am with you.
[time=3024] Always, always.
[time=3030] Moses is dead, but Joshua, I am with you.
[time=3036] Church, you'll go through change of leadership and change of leadership, but Jesus said, I am with you.
[time=3046] And I will never leave you, and I will never forsake you.
[time=3052] Jesus said, I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
[time=3061] Here's the second resource we have to access.
[time=3064] It's an allusion to what we've already studied.
[time=3067] It is the power of the Word of God, the power of the Word of God.
[time=3076] It says study God's Word, meditate on God's Word because it is the power that you need to make your way successful.
[time=3085] He says, you're going to go into the land, you're going to have the land, you simply stick to my Word because it has power.
[time=3093] Hebrews 4.12 says, the Word of God is living.
[time=3097] It is powerful.
[time=3099] It is sharper than a two-edged sword that pierces even to the dividing and two of joints and moral.
[time=3106] And it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intention of the heart.
[time=3113] God's Word is alive and it is powerful.
[time=3116] I love to tell a story.
[time=3118] You've probably picked that up even if this is your first day here.
[time=3121] But you know, there's no story out of history.
[time=3123] There's no humor that can make you laugh.
[time=3125] There's no poetry that can make you cry that has any power to change a life.
[time=3130] But God's Word has life-changing power.
[time=3135] And if we access its resource, we will have power in this church.
[time=3142] Romans 10-17 says, faith comes by hearing and hearing by.
[time=3150] God's Word.
[time=3154] We have this responsibility to make God's Word the very foundation of all that we do, of every decision that we make, of every value that we have.
[time=3169] It's got to be our reference point.
[time=3172] And we have these two resources to access the presence of God.
[time=3177] I am with you in the Word of God that is alive and powerful.
[time=3181] Here's our third principle for today.
[time=3183] And that is we can't anticipate the results.
[time=3188] God said to the nation of Israel, I'm going to give you this land.
[time=3191] He says to the church of Jesus Christ, I will build my church.
[time=3198] He said to Joshua, I'll be with you.
[time=3201] He said to the church, I'll never leave you nor forsake you.
[time=3205] Now look at what he says in verse 7 and 8 again.
[time=3210] Be strong and very courageous.
[time=3214] Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you.
[time=3218] Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left hand.
[time=3221] Now notice this, this is called a purpose clause.
[time=3224] Everything that he has said so far is to bring us to this statement that you may be successful.
[time=3233] Do you want to be successful in your private life?
[time=3236] Obeyed God's Word and launch out into the deep and be courageous.
[time=3241] And you'll be successful.
[time=3243] You want this church to be successful in the days ahead?
[time=3248] Then simply obey God's Word and courageously step out into the deep.
[time=3254] Trust him because he said he will make our way courageous.
[time=3260] A friend told me a story which is a great testimony for our church but for our Lord most of all.
[time=3269] Nearly a decade ago our church was going through times of change.
[time=3275] We had had a pastor for 12 years and he had moved and gone to California.
[time=3280] And the room around town was well, Black Hawk was a one man operation and it'll never last.
[time=3287] A man in this town said I was one who said that.
[time=3290] When I saw Black Hawk stay strong and then it stayed strong and then it grew and then it built a new building.
[time=3296] He said I had to admit that the power of that church was not its preacher, it was something else.
[time=3303] And that man said that's why I gave my heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=3310] That's why I gave my heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=3315] Pastor Jeremiah was a great and dynamic leader of this church.
[time=3320] He was used by God to found it and to direct it for 12 years and he left.
[time=3328] God had a different plan and we did okay.
[time=3333] Next Sunday will be my last Sunday in this pulpit and I will be gone.
[time=3338] Don't fill in the first verse, don't say hawks my servant is dead.
[time=3342] I'm not dying but I will be gone.
[time=3346] It won't be my voice, it won't be my personality and you know what?
[time=3352] It'll be okay because we are the church of Jesus Christ and he promises that he will never leave us.
[time=3367] To him be the glory both now and forever more.
[time=3371] Our God and Father as we bow our hearts before you today, we are convinced that your hand has uniquely blessed this church.
[time=3381] It is not because of its board art staff and I'm certainly aware that it's not because of any of the pastors this one in particular.
[time=3390] But you have blessed it because it's your church and your board has been honored.
[time=3397] And Father today in these days of transition help us to anchor our hope and our souls into Jesus who said I will never leave you.
[time=3409] The one who is described as the same yesterday, today and forever.
[time=3414] God anchor us to that, give us confidence, make of us bold in our decisions, make of us servants who work hard, who have faith
[time=3426] and who stick to your principles.
[time=3429] And now we ask you to move into the hearts and the minds of each one that's here or may have heard by way of television
[time=3437] to bring them to a point where they surrender their life to Jesus Christ.
[time=3442] For it's in his name that we pray. Amen.
[time=3447] This morning.
[time=3477] It's been our privilege to share the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir and special guests, Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=3484] The message today was from our pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=3488] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, just before we close I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3497] Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3504] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3508] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3513] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3517] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3522] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
