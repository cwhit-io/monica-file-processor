[time=1829] This passage that we just read in Matthew chapter 16 has an awful lot of detail in it.
[time=1834] A lot of things happening here that we've talked about over the years, the centuries, but it seems to me the obvious here is that Christ is announcing to this group of men called disciples that He's going to build His church, and He's going to use people like them to do it.
[time=1850] I will build my church.
[time=1852] Now, I'm not so sure how obvious that announcement was to this little group of disciples.
[time=1857] They heard Him say He would build His church.
[time=1859] I'm not sure they had any idea how that would happen or what their role would be.
[time=1864] Perhaps that seemed like just another announcement.
[time=1867] He had made many of them, you know, or did they realize that they were indeed in the presence of the master builder who was outlining not only His, but their future as well.
[time=1882] Now, you recall in the passage here that Peter, as he had expressed, had just begun to realize that this person was the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of the Living God, and that He would build His church.
[time=1895] Well, I'm sure these disciples figured that if He's going to build this thing called a church, we'll have some part in it.
[time=1901] Hopefully, in the ruling part, you know, the management aspects, we'd like to be a part of that.
[time=1908] Little did they realize that He would be the contractor.
[time=1912] He would be the designer, the architect, the contractor.
[time=1916] They would be the builders.
[time=1918] They would be the craftsman who would do the work of building His church.
[time=1923] I purpose this morning in tying together this passage in Matthew 16 with some other passages in the book of Acts is simply to stimulate you in your role of the building of His church.
[time=1938] We've talked about the who of the building of His church.
[time=1941] We've already noted the first who.
[time=1943] It's Jesus Christ, isn't it?
[time=1946] It's His church.
[time=1948] It's not Your church.
[time=1951] Not the elders' church.
[time=1952] It's not some pastors' church.
[time=1954] The church doesn't belong to the Pope.
[time=1956] The church is the church of Jesus Christ.
[time=1959] It's His church.
[time=1960] And if it is, it ought to be built His way.
[time=1964] According to His plans and by means of His instructions, by His criteria, with His methods, and certainly with His people.
[time=1973] And if we who build His church are going to do the work correctly as He designs, then we must be accountable to His standards too.
[time=1983] But there's a second who in the building of His church that is equally important.
[time=1988] And that is who He will build this church with.
[time=1991] I picture this scene here in Caesarea Philippi when Christ is with those disciples.
[time=1999] And you know, He's conversing with Peter.
[time=2001] And yet, as He answered Peter, I wonder if He didn't let His eyes drift
[time=2007] to all of the disciples that were standing there.
[time=2010] And I also wonder if He didn't at a point in time just lift His eyes up a little bit higher and kind of picture all of us, all of us who will follow in the centuries after Christ and who are willing to follow Him and to choose a cross way of life willing, as He says here, to take up a cross, deny self and follow me.
[time=2033] If I wonder if He said to all of us, I'm going to build my church.
[time=2037] And you have a part.
[time=2040] You've paused some time, haven't you, to think about His choice of craftsmen?
[time=2045] Christ seemed to be intent on carrying out Zechariah's contention,
[time=2051] not by might or by power or by skill or reputation or expertise
[time=2057] or credibility, but by My Spirit, Seth the Lord.
[time=2064] He built His church then, and He builds His church today with people whom Peter Marshall called disciples in clay.
[time=2074] Men fresh up from the beach with rough, worn hands that still smelled of fish.
[time=2082] You say, well, they were young men ready to go and qualified and expert at what it takes to do the ministry.
[time=2090] Well, I'm not so sure of that. History suggests that they were not all young.
[time=2095] In fact, many were very possibly older, certainly middle-aged, and definitely were ignorant and inexperienced in what it takes to build a church.
[time=2107] But He chose them, and they followed.
[time=2112] Men like Nathan, handsome, refined, you know, a gentleman,
[time=2118] but at the same time, very possibly an introvert, a bit of a dreamer,
[time=2124] not the type with which you would build a great church, but Jesus Christ chose Him, and He followed.
[time=2135] And there was some businessmen in that crowd amongst the twelve.
[time=2138] You remember a tax collector, probably, you know, a walking computer, the kind of man who drew numbers from the air and flow charts in the sands of Galilee.
[time=2147] A man who was impressed with evidences of wealth, he won't do in the building of the church, will he?
[time=2155] But Christ chose Him, and He followed.
[time=2160] And some of the women in His church, some with position, most of them rather non-descript, others, however, with quite a reputation.
[time=2169] You see, the point is they all believed in Him, they all trusted Him, they all made their commitment to Him, trusted Him, though not equally, and with these kind of people.
[time=2182] He began to build His church.
[time=2184] But wait, He began to build His church with them after.
[time=2189] After they were changed by the regenerating, filling, life-altering power of the Holy Spirit of God, the same Spirit that was spoken of in Zechariah's day, the same Spirit who came into our world at Pentecost, this same Spirit who was the glue as well as the explosive power
[time=2211] in the early church of Christ is the same Spirit that is available to us to do the work of building the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2220] He will give us a perspective.
[time=2223] He will give us an intensity.
[time=2225] He will give us a concern.
[time=2227] He will give us a tenacity to stick with the work of building the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2233] He can give you a picture of the worth of people.
[time=2236] He can give you a glimpse of what our building work will be worth when it is put here in the text to the fiery test to see what our work will be.
[time=2246] It reminds me of the snail who set out on a chill winter morning
[time=2252] to find the trunk of a rather bleak and for-lorn-looking cherry tree.
[time=2257] As he painfully began to inch his way up the trunk of the tree,
[time=2263] a little beetle poked his head out of a knothole up at the top and scornfully advised him, "Hey, you're wasting your time, friend.
[time=2272] There are no cherries up here." The little snail didn't stop moving for a second.
[time=2279] "It's no matter," he said, "there will be when I get there."
[time=2285] That's the kind of people with whom Christ builds His Church, isn't it?
[time=2289] The kind of people who trust Him.
[time=2292] The kind of people who have made a lifelong commitment to Him, people who have been willing to take up a cross way of life, deny themselves and follow Him, people who love Him, and have responded to His love.
[time=2308] In the land of Java, they tell of a young man who spied an incredibly beautiful maiden on the high road one day, and he followed her very deliberately for a mile or so.
[time=2319] Finally, she wheeled about and demanded, "Why do you dog my footsteps?" "Oh, because," he said, "you are the loveliest, most beautiful woman I have ever seen, and I have fallen madly in love with you at sight.
[time=2335] Be mine." She said, "You have merely to look behind you
[time=2344] to see my young sister, who is ten times more beautiful than I am."
[time=2352] Well, the gallant gentleman hesitated and then wheeled about and his gaze fell upon the homeliest, most unattractive sister,
[time=2364] as ever drew a breath.
[time=2366] "Gross," he said.
[time=2368] "Gross, what mockery is this?" he said to the beautiful girl.
[time=2372] "You lied to me." "So did you," she replied.
[time=2378] "If you were so madly in love with me, why did you turn around?"
[time=2385] It reminds me of the hymn writer who said, "Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=2392] Look full in his wonderful face, and all the other building projects of this earth will grow strangely dim
[time=2402] in the light of his glory and his grace and his beauty, and my friend, if you're going to make an impact on your world, if you're going to touch your community, if you're going to make an impact on your family, if you're going to build his church and make a difference, because we love him, we need to keep focused on him.
[time=2422] We've seen whose church it is, it's his church.
[time=2425] We've seen who it is that he's going to use to build his church, changed, committed disciples in clay, people like you and me.
[time=2434] Let me begin to wrap this together this morning by showing you who becomes his church, who are the building blocks in his church.
[time=2442] Now to do this, we leave the gospel of Matthew and turn over to the Acts of the Apostles.
[time=2448] I understand that some of you have just finished a study in the Book of Acts,
[time=2454] and so you're perhaps aware of the fact that the Book of Acts is kind of a photographic resume of putting together of the early life of the church.
[time=2468] I remember a few years ago being part of a building project, several of us went together and built a little cabin, and as we built the cabin, we took photographs.
[time=2478] And now we have one of those photographic albums that when you're beginning to be at the beginning, there's just bare ground, and then there's a hole in the ground, and some cement walls, and some two-by-fours, and some trusses, and some shingles, and then some siding, and as you go through the album, why the building begins to come together, and that's just what the Book of Acts is.
[time=2499] There are some interesting pictures in this photograph album called Acts.
[time=2503] I want you to look at three pictures with me.
[time=2505] Actually, several collections of pictures.
[time=2508] Number one, picture number one, I hold in my hand here, you see some pictures of some individuals.
[time=2515] There's a gentleman here, and there's a lady here, and a teenager here, and an older fella here, just some individuals, because Jesus Christ builds his church with individuals, doesn't he?
[time=2528] They say, "Well, I knew that. That's obvious." I only say that this morning to remind us that none of us came to Christ as a group.
[time=2539] None of us became a part of the Church of Jesus Christ, and had our names recorded on the Book of Life because we were a part of some group, because we had joined a church, or been baptized, or categorized into some church.
[time=2553] That isn't what brought us to Christ.
[time=2555] Maybe that church was the instrument that brought us to the place where we individually, personally, responded to the offer of Christ,
[time=2566] to forgive our sins if we would trust Him.
[time=2569] And individually, one at a time, we said yes to Jesus Christ.
[time=2575] We said, "I need a Savior. I want you in my life." Now, that's what was happening here in the Book of Acts, right at the beginning in chapter two.
[time=2584] Peter is preaching there on the day of Pentecost, you recall, to a group of people called Yiman of Israel.
[time=2591] He addressed them.
[time=2592] But I'm interested to notice in chapter two, in verse number 21, he says, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." He didn't say anything about the nation or the church calling on the name of the Lord.
[time=2606] He said, "Everyone individually who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." He tracks it through in verse number 38.
[time=2614] When they said, "What are we going to do?" He said, "Repend and be baptized." Every single one of you in the name of Christ so that your sins may be forgiven.
[time=2623] And then I notice in verse number 41, the response, "Those who accepted His message," and the Greek text leads us to suggest here
[time=2633] that that's an individual thing, "those individuals." As they personally accepted His message and were baptized, they were added to the number of the church that day.
[time=2645] Individuals singled out were added.
[time=2649] You see, there's two parts to this matter of individuals.
[time=2652] Number one, if you would be a part of His church, you will do so only as you make your personal commitment to Jesus Christ
[time=2661] and experience the forgiveness of your sins and the addition of your name to that number that are counted in His church.
[time=2669] But there's a second factor in this matter of individuals being a part of His church, and that is this.
[time=2674] If we as the church of Christ would build His church, then we need to focus on lost individuals.
[time=2682] Your role may not be up here in preaching.
[time=2685] It may not be in the classroom in teaching.
[time=2687] It may not be in the music ministry.
[time=2689] It may not be in the TV or the radio.
[time=2692] I don't know what your ministry is.
[time=2694] Perhaps your ministry, your role, is in the area of touching and reaching lost individuals for Christ.
[time=2704] I've spoken in so many smaller churches around the country, both in the West Coast and here in the Midwest, where I've heard the people pray so many times in so many different ways.
[time=2718] Lord, we need some workers.
[time=2721] We need some leaders in our church.
[time=2723] We need some deacons and some teachers and some musicians.
[time=2727] They've asked God for workers in their church.
[time=2731] How many of you, when you decided it was time to think about building a family,
[time=2738] went to God and began to pray, "Oh God, send us a teenager.
[time=2743] Lord, we need a boy to mow and a girl to mop.
[time=2747] Lord, send us some workers in this family." Well, of course not.
[time=2753] We ask God for a baby.
[time=2757] It reminds you that growth to families and growth to the church, the family of God is best accomplished through babies, through new believers meeting Christ and coming into the fellowship and beginning to grow in grace.
[time=2773] They've got to be discipled.
[time=2775] They've got to be taught.
[time=2777] They've got to be pampered a bit perhaps.
[time=2779] They've got to be worked with.
[time=2781] Oh, it takes work.
[time=2782] Sure, it takes work.
[time=2784] How much work?
[time=2785] Ask my wife in our middle age.
[time=2787] If she'd like to have another baby, you'll find out how much work it takes.
[time=2792] I'm not sure every church is willing to do that anymore.
[time=2795] I just spoke last week with the president of one of our fine evangelical seminaries who has also spoken in hundreds of churches and he admitted to me.
[time=2806] He said, "Dave, I have discovered that in my years of preaching, I used to think that churches wanted to grow.
[time=2814] Now I'm afraid that I'm beginning to think they really want to be comfortable."
[time=2820] It takes a lot of work to do the job of reaching new believers for Christ and then bringing them into the assembly and discipling them to the place where they can handle responsibility too.
[time=2833] I don't suspect that we have any grandmas and grandpas out here this morning, you know, maybe in your 70s who would be willing to have a new baby in your home.
[time=2843] Do I have any grandma that say, "Yes, I'd like a new baby." I'm not talking about the grandkids.
[time=2847] I'm talking about your own 24 hours a day.
[time=2850] Are you ready?
[time=2851] I have only had one grandmother who responded positively and they carried her out with the service.
[time=2856] It's too much work.
[time=2860] Another church needs to do that.
[time=2862] Let that young group, let them handle that.
[time=2865] Will you mark it down?
[time=2867] If and when that attitude ever begins to dominate a local church,
[time=2873] that part of the church of Jesus Christ is dying.
[time=2880] You see, we've begun to see that Jesus Christ is interested in building His church by reaching individuals.
[time=2887] But I want you to see, secondly, another photograph in my hand of family units.
[time=2893] You know, here's the Jones, I guess, in ancient Jerusalem.
[time=2897] It would be the Zacchaeus family or the Malachi family.
[time=2901] You know, here's a picture of families, lots of pictures of families.
[time=2905] God works in families.
[time=2908] If we're going to build His church, we need to reach family units.
[time=2912] Dr. Gene gets in his book, sharpening the focus of the church observes, the primary target for evangelism should be adults and consequently, whole households.
[time=2924] Christ and New Testament believers had high regard for children and their faith, but in the book of Acts sequentially, they went after adults in order to reach a whole family.
[time=2936] Family units are the basic building block for a healthy church.
[time=2941] Another scholar in the area of church growth observed that only churches that are built out of the basic social unit of the family have the true health and potential for rapid growth and steady, strong expansion.
[time=2954] Churches founded by families have the potential to flourish.
[time=2960] You say, well, is that true in the book of Acts?
[time=2963] Was that the pattern?
[time=2965] Oh, sure it was.
[time=2966] Look with me in chapter 10 of the book of Acts and see what was happening here in the building program of the church.
[time=2972] Chapter 10, verse number 24.
[time=2977] Peter is speaking and traveling and following day, verse 24 tells us he arrived in Caesarea.
[time=2984] Cornelius was expecting him and called together his relatives and close friends.
[time=2990] And then I drop over to verse 44, while Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message, all who under the influence of the preaching of Christ in Cornelius' family, his relatives even met Christ that day.
[time=3006] But then I scan over to chapter 16 in the book of Acts.
[time=3011] And notice with me, verse number 14.
[time=3015] One of those listening, as they were speaking, was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God.
[time=3023] The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.
[time=3027] When she and the members of her household were baptized.
[time=3031] And they were baptized because they believed in Christ.
[time=3035] The same thought you see is tracked over across the page with the Philippian jailer in chapter 16, verse number 31.
[time=3041] Believe in the Lord Jesus and you'll be saved, you and your household.
[time=3045] Then they spoke the word of the Lord to them.
[time=3047] And then I'll drop down to verse 34 and read, the jailer brought them to his house and set a meal before them.
[time=3053] And the whole family was filled with joy because they had come to believe in God.
[time=3059] And finally, chapter 18, verse number 8.
[time=3064] Christmas, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord.
[time=3071] Many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.
[time=3075] God works in family units.
[time=3078] We're going to build his church. We need to reach out and touch individuals.
[time=3082] And we need to reach out and touch whole family units and claim them for Christ.
[time=3086] Work with the children, but work with the moms and dads so that the church will grow as a result of family units being one to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3095] Because the church is built of individuals and family units.
[time=3099] But I've got one more picture for you.
[time=3101] It's my favorite. I get excited about this one.
[time=3104] It's simply a couple of photographs of some groups of people.
[time=3108] Here's one of a dozen people that you look at it, why they're all of a similar age.
[time=3113] Here's another one of about seven people, and they have a similarity to them.
[time=3117] But, you know, it's just a mixture. Here's another group of 20 or so.
[time=3122] You say, "Well, who are those people?" Well, they're what we call subgroups of society.
[time=3128] Social groups.
[time=3130] Groups that have come together for some special purpose and they have a certain contact and a certain friendship and somebody touched them with the message of Christ.
[time=3141] And we have a whole part of that group in the body of Christ.
[time=3146] You know, every one of us is a part of some segment, some subgroup of society.
[time=3151] Every one of us have some grouping in society that we touch that perhaps no one else does.
[time=3158] We fellowship with them. We bowl with them.
[time=3162] We work with them. We study with them. I don't know what it is, but there's some group beyond here that you touch that maybe no one else does.
[time=3171] I'm glad it's back with me in Acts to the sixth chapter.
[time=3176] And to kind of find a couple of very interesting verses here in Acts chapter 6.
[time=3183] In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against those of the Aramaic speaking community
[time=3195] because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
[time=3201] So the 12 gathered the disciples together and said, and we know there that from that came a group in the church of leadership, but I hope you notice there in verse number 1 of chapter 6, we had the number of the disciples, we have the Grecian Jews, we have the Aramaic speaking community, we have the widows, we have the 12, all these different little groups in society.
[time=3227] All these different subcultures at our church in Wheaton recently,
[time=3233] we have started in English as a second language course because we have a tremendous number of Laotian and Cambodian people who have moved into our area.
[time=3243] And lo and behold, we've discovered that as these people initially began to meet in our church, they then began to come back to some of the services, and someone in the church began to minister to them, and now we have a fairly sizable group of folk who came there actually for another reason, but found Christ through the ministry of the church.
[time=3263] Don't you imagine that Peter went back to his fishing buddies and said, fellas, I've got to tell you who I met, a person that changed my life.
[time=3273] Don't you imagine that Matthew went back to the money men of his day, the people who he used to work with, don't you imagine that Nathan went back to the yuppies of his culture
[time=3284] and said, let me tell you who I discovered, let me tell you who set me free,
[time=3290] let me tell you who I met, who gave my sins, and gave me a life worth living.
[time=3298] See, my question to you this morning is, what group do you touch that perhaps no one else touches like you do?
[time=3310] No pastor of this church or any church touches them, no missionary touches them, they may not turn on the radio or the TV or the gospel message, you may be the only contact they ever have with anybody that knows Jesus Christ.
[time=3328] Perhaps it's some professional group, perhaps it's some social group, some academic group,
[time=3334] some athletic group, perhaps it's that group of people we know
[time=3340] and in Chicago is the baby boomers and they're just changing a whole family structure and you're right in the middle of that group, and hey, I'm too old, I don't mix with them, but you do.
[time=3352] Did you notice here in Acts chapter 6 and verse number 7, there's a fascinating verse that tells us that the Word of God spread the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
[time=3367] What a tough group to reach for Christ, but somebody that had a contact
[time=3373] went back and shared the gospel of Christ with these people.
[time=3378] You see, we can't miss the obvious, can we?
[time=3382] Jesus Christ is building His church.
[time=3385] And the Lord Jesus Christ has designed that He would build His church through people like you, people like me.
[time=3394] He would build His church through this congregation and through believers who know Him.
[time=3399] May I remind you, with or without a pastor, He's going to build His church through you.
[time=3404] I can't help but notice that the greatest building in the Church of Jesus Christ took place just after the chief shepherd left.
[time=3412] He wants to do the work of building His church through His disciples in clay.
[time=3418] People have made commitment.
[time=3420] People who've said, "I believe, but more than that, I will follow.
[time=3424] I will take up that cross way of life, and I'll make an impact on my community for Jesus Christ."
[time=3433] I can't find in the Scriptures where the plan has changed.
[time=3437] All I can find is that if necessary, He will change us to be a minister for Him.
[time=3446] Have thine own way, Lord.
[time=3450] You're the potter, you're the master builder, I'm the disciple in clay.
[time=3456] Mold me, make me, after your will, while I'm waiting, yielded and still.
[time=3466] Thank God for using disciples in clay to build His church.
[time=3471] Amen?
[time=3472] [AMEN] Gracious Heavenly Father, we are so thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ who loved us and died for us,
[time=3482] and then gave to us the fantastic opportunity of building His church.
[time=3489] Lord, to those of us who have said yes to Christ, we accept that awesome opportunity,
[time=3496] to those who have never taken Him as their Savior.
[time=3499] May they say yes today.
[time=3501] Reach out and accept the gift and become a part of this fantastic body of Christ, His church.
[time=3513] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir, the Men's Singers, and Soloist Kevin Roll and Karine Sickafoos.
[time=3521] The message today was from our special guest, David Fetser.
[time=3525] David is in the communications department at Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, Illinois.
[time=3530] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3538] Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=3540] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3547] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3550] I ask You to come in and to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3554] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3558] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3563] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3573] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the pamphlet entitled "What the Bible Says About Jesus Christ",
