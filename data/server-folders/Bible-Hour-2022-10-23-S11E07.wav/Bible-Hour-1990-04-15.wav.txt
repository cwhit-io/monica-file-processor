[time=17] When the Declaration of Independence was issued, the 13 independent colleagues were declaring their independence from Great Britain.
[time=24] But, you know, just declaring independence did not mean they had independence.
[time=28] They first would have to win a war.
[time=31] Benjamin Franklin, the great states, knew that it would take unity and togetherness if this war would be won.
[time=37] And so he stood up and said to the group of gentlemen there, "Gentlemen, we must all hang together, or most assuredly, we will all hang separately." You know, that is so true today for the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=52] As we go against our enemy, Satan, we must indeed all hang together in the local church, or we will indeed all hang separately.
[time=63] [MUSIC]
[time=74] >> Welcome to an hour of Bible Study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=78] Thank you for joining us.
[time=80] Today, Associate Pastor Jim Pearson will be bringing us a message entitled, Paul's recipe for a unified Church.
[time=87] In 1776, the signers of the Declaration of Independence decided it would be better to hang together than to hang separately.
[time=95] That message is equally applicable for the Church in the 1990s.
[time=99] On today's program, Jim Pearson will be sharing some advice from the Apostle Paul on the subject of Church unity.
[time=106] His text is taken from the book of Philippians, chapter 2, verses 1 through 4.
[time=112] Our special music today includes a solo from Keith Brodigan, a duet from Keith and Star Brodigan, and a solo from Lisa Reniker.
[time=127] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir and orchestra brings us a song entitled, "Make a Joyful Noise."
[time=136] [MUSIC]
[time=144] >> Praise Him, Praise Him, Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=159] [MUSIC]
[time=189] >> Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=199] [MUSIC]
[time=219] >> Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=235] [MUSIC]
[time=257] >> Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=270] [MUSIC]
[time=292] >> O Zion, haste, thy mission, high fulfilling, publish glad tidings of redemption and release.
[time=300] That's our message today, hymn number 298.
[time=303] Hymn number 298 will sing, verses 1, 3, and 4.
[time=308] [MUSIC]
[time=325] >> O Zion, haste, thy mission, high fulfilling, do so to own the world that we saw.
[time=343] [MUSIC - 118 seconds]
[time=490] >> Amen, thank you very much for your singing.
[time=495] We do appreciate the orchestra as they lead us in worship as they proclaim through their instruments and you through your voices that great message that Jesus is alive and is our redemptive power.
[time=507] We continue with music now. Keith Rottingham is going to come and minister to us. Let's listen as he has a message for us in song right now.
[time=515] [MUSIC]
[time=527] >> In his love and in his pity, he redeemed us. In his love and in his pity, he provided him.
[time=550] Never has another loved us like the same your loves. How could anyone suspend himself upon the cross and die for me?
[time=577] Die willingly to set us free.
[time=590] But he did love. He had pity on us. He redeemed us through his blood.
[time=613] Shall we not return the favor? Live each day for a great savior and one day he will return for us.
[time=641] How he suffered in the garden for your sin and mine.
[time=655] See him shrugs up Calvary's mountain, not my will, but mine, cursing moms and angry soldiers spit upon his face.
[time=678] Then the sky in darkness grew and proved a death to which Manson would go.
[time=694] When Jesus died, he loved the soul. Yes, he did love.
[time=713] He had pity on us. He redeemed us through his blood.
[time=732] Shall we not return the favor? Live each day for a great savior and one day he will return for us.
[time=788] Hello again and thank you for joining us for the Bible hour. Our basis for fellowship today is our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=803] In the coming weeks I will be announcing and introducing to you special guests that will be speaking on the Bible hour.
[time=810] I hope that you will stay tuned each week. My guest today is Jim Pearson. Good morning Jim.
[time=815] Good morning Pete, how are you? I'm just fine. Jim is a member of our staff here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=822] And Jim as well as the rest of us on the staff have taken on new responsibilities in recent weeks since our pastor Rick Hawks resigned.
[time=829] Well Pete, that's very, very true. But I have enjoyed some of my new responsibilities.
[time=834] I have had more chance to get out into the local hospitals and I've had opportunity to meet so many of our Bible hour viewers who have been in for various ailments.
[time=842] It's been my pleasure to pray with you and minister to you at those times. But Pete, here at the church I've also been doing additional responsibilities.
[time=849] More teaching, more preaching. I'm looking forward to preaching again today.
[time=853] Yes, you are preaching in our morning and evening worship service. Jim, tell us a little bit about your message for this morning.
[time=859] Well this morning Pete, I'm preaching about the importance of unity and harmony in the local church of Jesus Christ if we are going to go ahead in our battle against Satan.
[time=868] Well we're looking forward to Jim's message. I'd like to tell you that on April 8th on Sunday morning we will be having a special guest.
[time=876] His name is David Fetser. David is a member of the faculty at Moody Bible Institute Chicago, Illinois.
[time=883] Please tune in especially for that date. You'll enjoy his preaching.
[time=887] And then I'd like to tell you about some coming events that are taking place in the life of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=893] On Friday April 13th, that's Good Friday, we'll be having a community-wide Good Friday service at the Grand Wayne Center downtown.
[time=902] That'll begin at 1215 and end promptly at 1245. And during this service we will have some special music, some drama and a message from one of our associate pastors Jim Teder.
[time=914] Again, that's April 13th, Good Friday, 1215 to 1245 at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=922] And then on Easter Sunday morning we will be having two services here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=928] In the morning we will have one at 915 and one at 1050. There will be a lot of music representing the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=936] We're going to do something a little bit different. We've invited two associate pastors Jim Pearson and Tim Teder to speak to us that morning.
[time=944] So it's at 915 and 1050. And then a great way to end Easter Sunday is to join with us at 6 p.m. in the evening for our Bespers service.
[time=954] We will have a lot of special music from our ensembles. We will have a special guest, Lynn Ford, who is a member of the staff at WBCL FM Radio here in town.
[time=964] She'll be doing a monologue for us and then we'll conclude the evening with a communion service.
[time=969] That's going to be a grand day and a good way to end, so we hope that you will join us at 6 p.m. April 15 for that service.
[time=977] And just before we go back to our live broadcast, I'd like to take a moment and tell you about a booklet that we'd like to offer you.
[time=984] This booklet is entitled What the Bible Says About Jesus.
[time=988] And this booklet says, Who is Jesus? What does He mean to you? Is it really important that you know Him?
[time=995] These are questions and other questions that are answered for you in this booklet and we'd like to send it to you today.
[time=1002] Pete, this booklet is so good and I think it does such a great job of explaining about our wonderful Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1009] All of our viewers today can get that book. All they need to do is write to us here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1015] The address is 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1028] Thank you, Jim, and now we go back to our live broadcast for some music and then the message by Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=1045] We'll give back to you, of course, what we are showing our love for you.
[time=1056] We would just ask now that you had blessed us offering to the attendant used in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1072] What language shall I borrow to thank the dearest friend?
[time=1086] For this thy dying sorrow thy pity with old hand.
[time=1099] We'll make thee die forever, and should I fainting be?
[time=1113] O'er that we never, never, ever, out live thy love for thee?
[time=1137] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[time=1149] He bore our sins in his body on the tree.
[time=1160] For our guilty gave us peace, from our bondage gave reliefs.
[time=1174] And with his stripes, and with his stripes,
[time=1185] and with his stripes, our souls are healed.
[time=1208] He was numbered among transgressors.
[time=1219] We did esteem him forsaken by his God.
[time=1230] As our sacrifice he died, that the Lord be satisfied,
[time=1244] and all our sin, and all my sin, and all our sin was laid all in.
[time=1275] Who can no longer, is there no ray songs?
[time=1287] Who shall declare of the triumphs of his cross?
[time=1298] Millions did not live again.
[time=1304] Millions follow in his tree.
[time=1312] Victoria's Lord.
[time=1328] And come in, in.
[time=1347] Thank you, Keith, and Starr, let's pray.
[time=1350] Father, we just thank you this morning for an opportunity to gather together to worship, but most of all to call glory to you.
[time=1358] Father, I just thank you that we can praise you, glorify you, by way of song.
[time=1363] I just thank you that we can hear your word proclaimed, then we can read it, internalize it, and make it a part of our lives.
[time=1370] But Father, this morning I also thank you that we can come to you in prayer, that we can bow before you humbly, petition you, and ask you to be a blessing in our life.
[time=1381] Father, I just want to lift up the family this morning of William Bennett. I lift up his son, his daughters.
[time=1389] I just lift up the rest of all those that are left behind, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, as Bill is now in your arms.
[time=1396] I thank you for the way that he served you, for the testimony that he had here at Blackhawk, and although we will miss him, I just praise you and thank you that he is with you today.
[time=1406] And Father, I would pray that you would give strength, encouragement to Tony and Betty Woods this morning as Tony's mother lies near death.
[time=1415] Father, she's 97 years old, and she has loved you and trusted you for many years.
[time=1420] But Father, we would pray that if it would be your will, that you would intervene into that situation.
[time=1425] But Father, I would just ask that you would give encouragement and strength to Tony and Betty, give them the strength that they need during these times of trial.
[time=1433] Father, we just ask your blessing upon our church as we go through this transitional time.
[time=1438] We thank you for the bond of unity that is ours today, for the harmony, the oneness that our church has.
[time=1444] We praise you for that. We thank you for your Holy Spirit who, through his power and the fellowship that we have with him, helps us to be a unified body of believers.
[time=1453] We just ask your blessing upon the remainder of our time together, upon me as I proclaim the word, upon the singers as they sing.
[time=1460] But most of all I would pray that those who need to know you before they would leave today would turn to you and trust in you as their Savior and Lord.
[time=1468] In Christ's name, amen.
[time=1473] Our Father, we chart in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[time=1498] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=1522] Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors,
[time=1541] and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[time=1553] For the line is the kingdom and the power in the glory for you.
[time=1575] [AMEN]
[time=1586] Thank you, Lisa.
[time=1591] It has been almost exactly a year since I joined the senior staff here at Black Hawk as an associate pastor.
[time=1597] It has been an eventful, but also very enjoyable and quick year in my life and in my new career as a minister.
[time=1605] There have been several firsts in this past year.
[time=1609] A couple of weeks ago, as many of you know, I performed my first baptism.
[time=1613] And as I said that night, those that were being baptized deeply coveted, your prayers for their protection during that time.
[time=1620] I later saw the chairman of the board, Bill Archer, out in the foyer, and he looked at me and said, Jim, it was a success.
[time=1625] Five went down, five came up. What more could we ask?
[time=1629] But what you don't know is that at about five minutes to seven, just as I was getting ready to pray and go in to do the baptisms, Bob Roddenbach came in, dressed up like a navy frogman, walked into the baptismal, and it was there to save any who might go under that I might lose.
[time=1646] It's been a very eventful year, my first baptism, first wedding, also my first staff retreat.
[time=1652] We went on a staff retreat and I had a picture of a staff retreat as being something serious where we took out our legal pads and sat at a table and just banged out the church schedule with our calendars for hours and hours and hours.
[time=1666] And there was definitely some of that involved, but the highlight of our retreat was the night that we played laser tag with all the senior staff.
[time=1674] Tim Teder was able to get six laser tag guns. That was the most important thing we brought along.
[time=1679] And that night we went out into the woods around Clear Lake and under the cover of Darkness with our targets flashing on our chests and our laser tag guns, we all went out and I learned a few things about our staff.
[time=1690] You know, we're a very harmonious and friendly group, but we turned into survivalists that night.
[time=1697] I don't know if it was the competitiveness of the moment or what it was. I thought Steve Longbreak was going to lose his sanctification that night.
[time=1706] We had to grab a flag to win the game and as I finally got, was undetected, I grabbed the flag and I began to run back into the territory where I might get and we would win the game and I tripped and fell on my way.
[time=1719] And Rick walked up to me and said, Jim, are you okay? And I said, yeah, he said good, you're dead.
[time=1729] Had our first staff retreat, first baptism, first wedding. It's been an enjoyable time. Not too long ago, I heard a story about a pastor's wife.
[time=1738] This has been an important year in my wife's life also. I heard a story recently, though, about a pastor's wife who was out in the foyer after church.
[time=1746] And one of the ladies in the church walked up and put her arm around her and said, oh, I just want you to know that I'm praying that there will be a special place in heaven reserved for pastors' wives.
[time=1758] This woman looked at her and said, oh, I hope not. I want to spend eternity with my husband.
[time=1767] Well, if you have a Bible with you, I invite you to open it with me to the book of Philippians, the book of Philippians, and as you're turning, let's just ask the Lord to bless our time together one more time.
[time=1779] Father, thank you for your word. Thank you for the blessings of life. Thank you for the way that you give us the things that we need.
[time=1786] We just ask your blessing now in Christ's name. Amen. When the Declaration of Independence was signed, the United States of America had not yet been created, but there were 13 original colonies that had declared their independence.
[time=1804] Benjamin Franklin, the great statesman, knowing that it would take more than just a declaration to have freedom.
[time=1811] He knew that those 13 original colonies would have to band together. They would have to have a unity and a harmony of spirit that would allow them to fight that foe of Great Britain and throw off the shackles and win their freedom.
[time=1826] Benjamin Franklin, knowing how important unity was, stood up at that great meeting at the Second Continental Congress, and he made this statement.
[time=1835] He said, "Gentlemen, we must all hang together, or certainly we will all hang separately."
[time=1845] Benjamin Franklin knew something about human nature. He also knew something about life, and that is that no matter what institution it is, whether it be a family, or a school, or a corporation, or a church, there must be unity, there must be harmony.
[time=1863] If we are to survive and to go on and to be successful in life.
[time=1871] Most of us, as parents, know this also, and we have tried to teach our children as best we can, the importance of getting along.
[time=1879] I suppose that most of us, at a very young age, take our children and begin to teach them the importance of getting along with others.
[time=1888] We tell them things like share your toys. Don't hit your friends. Andrew, don't be selfish with that cookie, share it with your next-door neighbor.
[time=1898] We say all of these things because we want them to live in harmony and unity with their fellow man.
[time=1906] One of the things which we taught our son Drew was several of those things, but we also taught him that one of the things that you have to do to obey or to get along in society, you must obey the laws.
[time=1918] You must do what the policeman tells you, and we told him that if you do that, the policeman will be your friend, and you'll get along in harmony and unity with your friends and with society, and everything will be just fine.
[time=1930] When he was about two and a half years old, that law came out which required children to be in a child restraint seat whenever they were in the car.
[time=1939] Well, we went and took Drew and got him his infant seat, and we sat him down and we taught him the rules.
[time=1945] We said, Andrew, it's very important that whenever you see a policeman, it's important that you be in your car seat.
[time=1954] He nodded his head as best as he could understand, but we told him, Andrew, it's not up for question.
[time=1960] You must be in your car seat when you see a policeman.
[time=1963] He understood. We later found out he understood too well.
[time=1967] One day he was going through the grocery store with his mother, and he was riding along in the cart.
[time=1972] And all of a sudden he started jumping up and down, and terror came on his face.
[time=1977] And Linda said, Andrew, what's wrong? He said, there's a policeman over there, there's a policeman over there.
[time=1982] And Linda said, Drew, that's okay. The policeman are your friends. We told you that.
[time=1987] You don't have to worry about that. And he said, no, no, you don't understand.
[time=1991] There's a policeman over there, and I'm not in my car seat.
[time=1994] He had learned so well the importance of doing what he was told of getting along with his friends and his neighbors.
[time=2003] Perhaps one of the great authors of our time, Robert Fulghum, has summed up this same idea of unity.
[time=2010] He says that everything that he ever really needed to know, he learned in kindergarten.
[time=2016] He wrote a book by that same name, and in that book he shares some great insights for getting along in the world,
[time=2023] getting along in peace and harmony with our fellow man. Fulghum writes this.
[time=2029] All I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be, I learned in kindergarten.
[time=2035] Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school mountain, but there in the sandpile at Sunday school.
[time=2042] These are the things I learned. Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people.
[time=2051] Put things back where you found them. Clean up your own mess. Don't take things that aren't yours.
[time=2059] Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody. Wash your hands before you eat. Flush.
[time=2068] Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you. Take a nap every afternoon.
[time=2075] Live a balanced life. Learn some and think some. And most importantly, when you go out into the world, watch out for traffic.
[time=2083] Hold hands and always stick together. You know, everything you need to know in life is there.
[time=2092] The golden rule, love, basic sanitation, ecology and politics and equality, same living.
[time=2100] It's all there, writes Robert Fulghum.
[time=2103] Well, you know, getting along with people, being able to live in unity and harmony, is so important for us to have success in life.
[time=2111] But perhaps nowhere is it more important than in the Church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2117] Perhaps nowhere is it more important than in the local church body where we exist today at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2126] Oh, I've been thrilled by the harmony and the unity that we have seen in our church over the past months and years of time.
[time=2134] But it's my prayer that as we go on in the days and the weeks and the months ahead,
[time=2140] the week would continue with that spirit of unity, holding on together.
[time=2145] In our text this morning, Philippians chapter two, Philippians chapter two, the great apostle Paul,
[time=2152] gives what I have called a recipe for a harmonious church, a recipe for a harmonious church.
[time=2160] And in these verses of Scripture, I would like to give you six ingredients for a harmonious, unified church.
[time=2169] Six ingredients, which if we will make sure are here being practiced at Black Hawk Baptist Church,
[time=2176] then the great unity and harmony that we have had will go on in the days ahead.
[time=2183] I'm going to read verses one through four, and as I do so that there's no confusion, I'd like to point out one thing.
[time=2189] Verse one is written in a special type of indirect fashion that was common in the time of Paul.
[time=2196] All of these clauses are in Greek, what is called first class conditions.
[time=2200] That means that although they are in the form of uncertainty, it is presumed that they are true.
[time=2207] And so don't be fooled by what Paul says, he is saying that all of these things in verse one are true.
[time=2213] I'm going to read it, paraphrase it in such a way that that will be clear.
[time=2218] Paul writes, "If you have any encouragement for being united with Christ, and you have,
[time=2224] if any comfort from his love, and you have had that, if any fellowship with the spirit,
[time=2231] and you have had that fellowship, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.
[time=2244] Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.
[time=2252] Each of you should not only look to your own interests, but also to the interests of others."
[time=2258] From these great words of the great Apostle Paul, as we point out the ingredients of a harmonious church,
[time=2265] I would first like to point out in verse one, the first ingredient, and that is lots of encouragement.
[time=2272] The first ingredient for a harmonious church is lots of encouragement within the body of Christ.
[time=2279] Paul writes to them and says, "If you have been encouraged by Christ, and I know that you have,
[time=2286] then encourage all of those in the church at Philippi, encourage all of those around you."
[time=2294] That word there, encouragement, is an interesting word.
[time=2297] It means called alongside of, called alongside of to give comfort, to give encouragement to.
[time=2306] Also, that same word came to mean person-to-person counsel.
[time=2312] And so, when Paul says, "Give lots of encouragement within the body," he is saying, "Go alongside someone who's hurting. Put your arm around their shoulder.
[time=2322] Speak to them in one-on-one counsel and encouragement.
[time=2327] Speak to them the words that they need to hear." That's encouragement. And Paul says, "Christ has done it for you.
[time=2336] Do it now for your brothers and sisters who are down and who need encouragement."
[time=2342] Dr. Larry Krab has written an excellent book on this subject of encouragement.
[time=2347] And in his book, he gives a definition to the term that, at first as I read it, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but the more I thought about it, the more I do.
[time=2356] Dr. Krab defines encouragement this way.
[time=2359] He says, "encouragement is the kind of expression that helps someone want to be a better Christian,
[time=2365] even when life is rough." It helps someone want to be a better Christian because you have lifted them up by your encouragement.
[time=2376] I have permission to use this illustration this morning because it meant so much to me, but I wanted to make sure that those involved understood why and that I had their permission.
[time=2387] Most of us know that Wayne and Debbie Moore for several months went through a long struggle as they watched their daughter Amy struggle against the cancer that finally took her.
[time=2397] Many times as a pastor it was my privilege to have a chance to minister to Wayne and Debbie and Amy
[time=2404] first at a local hospital and then at hospitals in Indianapolis and then back in home over Amy's last days.
[time=2413] Many it was a time that I stood and tried as best I could to give words of encouragement,
[time=2421] to give words of encouragement to somebody who was going through the roughest time that a parent could ever go through.
[time=2428] But you know, many a time it was by the joy and peace and contentment that I saw in their lives.
[time=2437] Many a time it was I got back in my car to go home and as I went back home I realized that it was me who had been encouraged by them.
[time=2446] And many a time I looked through the windshield of the car as I drove and I just said, "Oh God, make me a better Christian.
[time=2453] Make me a better believer. Help me to have the peace and the contentment that I see in Wayne and Debbie."
[time=2461] Yes, encouragement is building each other up. It's counseling, but it's also making each other want to be a better believer.
[time=2470] This morning at Blackhawk it would be my prayer that you would look out and see those that need encouragement
[time=2476] and that you would reach down and give them a comforting word.
[time=2480] And then secondly Paul says in the same verse he says, "We are to give lots of loving comfort." A second ingredient of the recipe is lots of loving comfort.
[time=2494] Paul goes on to say, "If there has been any comfort from the love of Christ then give that to your fellow believers."
[time=2503] Loving comfort is kind words, it's deeds, it's actions whereby we reach out in love.
[time=2511] And Paul says, "Pattern your behavior toward your brothers and sisters after the way that Christ has first loved you."
[time=2520] You know, to understand the full importance of that verse we have to understand the depth of Christ's love.
[time=2528] Christ's love is two things. First of all, it is continual.
[time=2533] Christ does not love us this morning and then tomorrow morning when we get up find that He doesn't love us anymore.
[time=2541] Oh no. Christ's love is continual. Christ's love never changes.
[time=2546] He is the same in His love and His promises yesterday, today and forever.
[time=2551] Not only is it continual, but secondly it is unconditional.
[time=2556] Christ's love for us is not determined by how we treat Him.
[time=2561] Christ's love for us is not determined by the things that we do in our service to Him.
[time=2567] He loves us unconditionally no matter what when we are His children.
[time=2572] You know, that lesson is so important as we reach out to those in the body of believers that we reach out to them continually in our love and unconditionally.
[time=2582] I got a phone call one day at work many years ago, about 14 years ago, but I'll never forget it.
[time=2589] I got a phone call at work. My secretary said, "Jim, I think you ought to take this call. It's your wife."
[time=2595] Well, I always took my wife's calls, but I said, "Is there anything wrong?" She said, "Yes, your wife's crying."
[time=2601] I got on the phone and Linda was sobbing very, very loudly and all I could hear her say was, "Jim, the car, the car."
[time=2611] Now, I want you to know that it wasn't just any car. It was the car.
[time=2619] This was the most beautiful car Detroit, Michigan ever created.
[time=2626] My love for this vehicle in these days before I had children and pets bordered on idolatry.
[time=2636] I loved my car. It was so beautiful, gleaming white paint, black pinstripes, a black vinyl top.
[time=2647] I still remember it in its new condition.
[time=2652] That day, I drove down the highway toward home, and as I pulled in the driveway, I immediately saw what had happened.
[time=2660] My wife had gotten out of the car, had not put it in park as she thought that she should. It had slipped back into drive,
[time=2666] and as she was going in the side door to the house, the car had continued on and had knocked down the garage door.
[time=2673] The garage door was resting on my beautiful, brand new car, but that's not where it ended.
[time=2682] The car had continued on and had gone through and knocked out the back wall of the garage, and now the whole garage practically was caving in around my car.
[time=2692] A dagger was stabbing me in the heart as I drove down the driveway, but as I got out of my car, the worst thing was my insurance agent,
[time=2700] who happened to be a friend of mine. My soon-to-be former insurance agent was laying on the ground, laughing like a hyena, as he saw me get out of my car.
[time=2711] I said, "Vick, what is so funny?" He just laughed. He said, "Well, you're a junk dealer, aren't you?"
[time=2717] I said, "Yes." He said, "Well, I know we can get two tons of junk, real cheap."
[time=2723] But you know, as anger might have been in my heart at that moment, my love for my wife is not conditional,
[time=2733] and the Bible teaches me it is to be continual, even in those times when something happens that hurt me or I don't agree with.
[time=2743] When I took an oath to love my wife, I took an oath to love her until life death do us part.
[time=2750] And I walked up to her, and I put my arms around her, and I said, "Linda, don't worry about it. That's why we have insurance. We'll get a new car. You're never going to drive it, but we're going to get a new car!"
[time=2768] That is the way we are to love our brothers and sisters here at Blackhawk. Unconditionally, continually, reach out, love your brothers and sisters here today.
[time=2780] Moving on, thirdly, we are to have in our recipe for a harmonious church lots of tenderness and compassion.
[time=2788] Paul writes, "If any tenderness and compassion, as a body of believers, we are to be unified in a church that is tender and caring."
[time=2800] You know, caring is the opposite of indifference. And Paul is teaching us there that we are to be a caring, unified body of believers.
[time=2811] The two words there, tenderness and compassion. Compassion in the King James Version is translated "mercy." And I like that.
[time=2820] "Tenderness" means a very deep affection. "Mercy" means the love of God, the love that God has for us, and the things that He does to manifest it in our lives and upon us.
[time=2835] Paul says that we are to love in tenderness and compassion. We are to care deeply for our brothers and our sisters.
[time=2846] We have in our church an adult Bible fellowship program, and it's a good one.
[time=2853] We have a system which helps us to create a church within a church. It helps us to take the large church and make that church small.
[time=2862] One of the great joys for me has been watching the ABF's work on Sundays and then work throughout the week out there where the rubber meets the road.
[time=2871] The way that they minister to those in their classes that are in need, the meals that are provided, the counseling that is done.
[time=2878] It has been my thrill many times and was this week to go to the hospital to pray with one of our people who was having an operation
[time=2886] and to find that even though I got there at seven o'clock in the morning, there were two members of an ABF that were already there praying with that person.
[time=2894] I want to thrill it was for me to see that, that we could pray together.
[time=2898] We are to be a caring church, a tender church, full of compassion.
[time=2904] And I praise the ABF's and the deacons and the elders and all of the people involved for the work that they do.
[time=2911] And I want to thank Mark Clough for the great work that he has done and the time that he has been the director of our adult Bible fellowships
[time=2918] and as he leaves that position, just like to thank him for a job well done.
[time=2922] We have caring adult Bible fellowships.
[time=2925] We're taking the teaching of Paul and putting it to work in the New Testament local church.
[time=2931] It's such a thrill for me.
[time=2933] And then, fifthly, Paul says that we are to have lots of oneness among our members, lots of oneness.
[time=2943] Notice what he says in verse two.
[time=2945] He says, "If all of these things have been true, then make my joy complete." How? By being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit, and purpose.
[time=2957] Paul says that for our church to be harmonious, we need one more ingredient in the recipe, and that is lots of oneness among the members.
[time=2967] He says that we are to be like-minded.
[time=2971] He says that we are to have a oneness of purpose.
[time=2975] And that purpose is always to be to glorify God and to win as many as we can to him before our Lord returns.
[time=2983] All we are to march on as a mighty, closely knit army together for the purpose of doing God's work.
[time=2992] One in spirit, one in purpose, one in unity, and harmony.
[time=3000] I remember ninth-grade basketball so well.
[time=3004] I played on the worst ninth-grade basketball team in the history of Ohio High School basketball.
[time=3011] It was terrible. We won one, maybe two games the entire season, never by more than one point.
[time=3018] You know, it was torture going through that season, and we eventually got better as we got older.
[time=3023] But there was something that I noticed and something I thought back on.
[time=3028] The reason that we had such a poor team is that we were not knit together as a unit.
[time=3034] We did not have any oneness in spirit.
[time=3038] We did not have any togetherness and joy of a spirit of team unity.
[time=3045] Many of you have probably been watching the NCAA basketball tournament.
[time=3049] And one of the things that has stuck out to me has been the team spirit, the team unity that the teams have had.
[time=3056] Oh, we didn't have any of that.
[time=3058] We had a lot of selfishness on our team.
[time=3061] You know, on our team, nobody wanted to take the ball out of bounds.
[time=3065] If they were afraid, if they passed it in, they wouldn't get it back.
[time=3068] That's how selfish we were.
[time=3070] Our team, one time our coach said to me, "Piercing, you know, we have a given go offense on our team.
[time=3075] Give Pearson the ball. Everybody else might as well go home." You just keep the ball to yourself all the time.
[time=3081] But, you know, as we grew together, they're developed a oneness and a knitting together of spirit.
[time=3089] And as we got along later into the years, oh, we didn't win every game, but we won many.
[time=3094] We played more together as a team.
[time=3097] Paul says we already have lots of oneness in our membership.
[time=3101] We are to focus on the great commission.
[time=3105] We are to always to be looking out for our fellow man.
[time=3111] And then lastly, Paul tells us we are to have lots of heism, not meism.
[time=3121] Let me explain that.
[time=3126] In the last verse, Paul says, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit.
[time=3132] But in humility, consider others better than yourselves.
[time=3136] Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others."
[time=3144] Paul is warning here against the dangers of meism.
[time=3149] The dangers of selfishness, where we look to ourselves in our own interests first and only.
[time=3157] Where we allow ourselves to divide up into divisive groups and factions, where we look out only for ourselves and what we can have.
[time=3166] Paul says to them, "Oh, avoid that.
[time=3169] Don't develop this meism of looking out for number one." I believe he is speaking here about a group type of selfishness, where groups gather together
[time=3179] and then don't look out for their fellow man.
[time=3183] It is a me-centered thinking that doesn't look out for others.
[time=3188] Paul says that's not the way it should be.
[time=3190] Don't be selfish.
[time=3192] Don't act out of vain conceit or ambition.
[time=3194] But humbly consider others better than yourselves.
[time=3199] Look out not for your own interests, but for the interests of others.
[time=3204] You know, I think that many times a church functions much like a family.
[time=3209] And you all know that in a family unit we must function together.
[time=3214] What does that mean?
[time=3216] It means many times we don't always get our way.
[time=3219] It means many times we don't get to do what we want to do.
[time=3224] It means that many times we have to give of ourselves to give in and be humble and submit to the rights of other members of our family.
[time=3233] We ask our children to do it.
[time=3235] Hopefully we as husbands and wives do it to each other.
[time=3238] But we cannot let factions and sides develop in our marriages and in our families.
[time=3243] We must be willing to give.
[time=3245] To do things that we don't want to do.
[time=3247] To do things that aren't convenient.
[time=3252] One of the things which I hate to do is shovel snow.
[time=3258] Two of my neighbors, Larry and Julie Suttner, here this morning, and they know what I say about snow.
[time=3263] They know how much I don't like to shovel snow.
[time=3265] I figure God put it there.
[time=3267] Let God take it away.
[time=3270] I don't like the effort of shoveling snow.
[time=3272] It's not something that I really enjoy doing.
[time=3275] I like that commercial for diet Pepsi on TV.
[time=3278] I would like you to know I would rather eat lint than I would shovel snow.
[time=3284] But you know I can't take that attitude.
[time=3287] I have a role in my family as a family leader.
[time=3291] I have a role that says that certain jobs are mine to do.
[time=3295] And the safety and the appearance of my home and the safety of my family.
[time=3301] My testimony as a Christian and as a good neighbor are all at stake.
[time=3307] As I go out and do the things sometimes that I don't like to do.
[time=3312] I pray for winners like we have had this year.
[time=3314] I only had to shovel snow one time.
[time=3316] It was great.
[time=3317] It made me a real happy camper.
[time=3319] I want you to know.
[time=3320] But you know it's the same in the church.
[time=3323] We cannot allow divisions and factions to occur in the church where we put ourselves first
[time=3331] and don't put the needs of others before our own.
[time=3335] Many times groups in churches become divided over issues.
[time=3339] One of those issues we talked about in the Bible Institute some weeks back.
[time=3343] One of those things that has caused a great deal of division within churches is that of the doctrine of predestination versus free will.
[time=3351] Very simply put the doctrine of predestination is that doctrine that states that God has chosen all who will come to him.
[time=3359] And in his own time he draws the elect to him.
[time=3363] Truly they are ordained by God for salvation.
[time=3366] The other side says that they believe in free will.
[time=3370] That they believe that any and all can come to Jesus Christ.
[time=3374] And as they hear the word proclaim many will come to Jesus Christ as they are drawn by the Spirit.
[time=3381] But they come not because they are of the elect.
[time=3383] They come because it is of their own free will.
[time=3386] Oh that's one of the issues which has torn apart many churches.
[time=3390] Oh it has never been an issue here and I praise God for that.
[time=3393] Let me tell you the story about a church.
[time=3395] I read a book this week which I thoroughly enjoyed.
[time=3398] It was called Great Church Fights.
[time=3400] And it talks about some of the great fights that have taken place in church history.
[time=3405] And one of the anecdotes which the author tells is this.
[time=3408] I want you to picture a group in a church that have been arguing over predestination versus free will.
[time=3414] And finally they have split apart and they have got their camps drawn.
[time=3417] And they're not going to let anybody in who doesn't see things exactly their way.
[time=3421] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir in Orchestra.
[time=3430] Solar was Keith Brodigum and a duet by starring Keith Brodigum and a solo by Lisa Reniker.
[time=3437] The message today was from our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=3441] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3449] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I have this opportunity to pray to you today.
[time=3455] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3459] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3464] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3468] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3473] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3481] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the pamphlet entitled "What the Bible Says About Jesus Christ"
