[time=1048] Thank you, David.
[time=1051] We have the privilege of having a great guest with us this morning.
[time=1054] Someone that many of us will remember because we were pleased to have Dr. Carl Savoy in here in the summer for the summer Bible Conference.
[time=1062] This morning I asked one of our school teachers as I walked by after the first service, so the message was he said it was a banquet and I couldn't wait for the next helping.
[time=1072] I'm looking forward to hearing this message this morning.
[time=1075] Before Dr. Savoy comes to speak to us what God has on his heart, reflection is going to come and sing for us.
[time=1083] And a member of reflection, Wayne Moore, has had some trauma in his life in this last year.
[time=1089] He's going to give a testimony for us.
[time=1092] The Lord giveth and the Lord takeeth away, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[time=1097] This morning I want to share with you a couple of things and my goal this morning is that first of all and foremost our Savior be lifted up and he be praised.
[time=1107] And the second thing that I want to accomplish is I want to encourage those of you that may be hurting, those of you who have had hurts in the past.
[time=1116] God uses those hurts that adversity in our lives and I'm convinced it's his best tool that he uses to make us and conform us into his image so that we can then be used of God to accomplish his purposes.
[time=1130] There are three things this morning that I want to share with you, but before I do for the benefit of those who don't know me or who don't know Amy or for those of you who may be visiting I want to share with you a little background.
[time=1142] Back in September my daughter was diagnosed as having a rare type of cancer
[time=1148] called Burkett's lymphoma.
[time=1150] After three weeks of extensive treatment we rejoiced with the fact that we thought that that cancer was gone.
[time=1157] However with continued extensive treatment it left her paralyzed and unable to breathe and on a ventilator.
[time=1164] And we had to discontinue those treatments and very quickly her cancer came back and about six weeks ago Amy went to be with the Lord.
[time=1172] And I share with that I share that with you because there are three things that I want you to be aware of
[time=1178] that as I thought what I was going to say this morning I would hope that this would encourage you.
[time=1183] The first thing I want to assure you of is that God is sovereign.
[time=1187] He is in control, he is in charge and he will bring into our lives and he will allow things into our lives
[time=1194] for his own purposes.
[time=1196] And though that attribute may seem harsh one of his other attributes will balance that and that is the attribute of love
[time=1204] because the same Lord that allowed that to happen to Amy allowed those things into our family's life
[time=1210] is the same God that went to the cross and died for her sins, my sins and your sins.
[time=1215] So I was comforted with that.
[time=1217] The second thing that I want to share with you is and I want to assure you of is God's peace.
[time=1224] Isaiah 26 3 says that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee.
[time=1231] And I want to assure you of that this morning those of us who are believers and have Christ in our heart
[time=1237] already have have already obtained that peace because it says in John 1633 that he is our peace.
[time=1244] It's not something that he sprinkles from heaven whenever we think we need it.
[time=1248] It's something that we have with us at all times.
[time=1251] Many of us have obtained that peace but many of us don't know how to access it.
[time=1256] And I want to encourage you this morning to access that peace by doing two very simple things that we've been taught as we were little children.
[time=1264] You need to develop and nurture that relationship with your heavenly Father.
[time=1268] And you do that by praying and you do that by reading his word.
[time=1272] I can't tell you how precious his word became to me during these past months.
[time=1277] I can't tell you how precious my prayers to him and how that brought peace and contentment to me
[time=1283] in some of the darkest hours of my life.
[time=1286] Third thing I want to assure you of this morning is God's grace.
[time=1290] You folks have been a part of that grace.
[time=1293] I wrote it on every thank you note that I wrote that God's grace is indeed sufficient.
[time=1297] Paul in the 2 Corinthians chapter 11 goes through all those experiences in life that he went through
[time=1303] the shipwrecks, the beatings and the stonings and all those events.
[time=1307] And yet he assured us in his word that his grace is indeed sufficient.
[time=1312] And I could give you story after story and I won't do that this morning that would assure you of God's grace.
[time=1319] But I can assure you that it is real and that he will give it to you when you need it.
[time=1324] And that that is one of the most precious things about our relationship with our heavenly Father.
[time=1330] We need to make sure folks that we take our time and develop that relationship.
[time=1335] He is our sufficiency. He is all that we need.
[time=1338] We spend a lot of time advancing our careers and buying our homes and buying our cars.
[time=1343] We don't spend a whole lot of time many times developing the most important relationship that will take you through those tough times.
[time=1350] And Christ is our sufficiency. He is all that we need.
[time=1354] Even our loving human relationships will disappoint.
[time=1358] Spouses will die. Parents will die. Even children will die.
[time=1362] But our relationship with our heavenly Father goes on.
[time=1365] So this morning I want to assure you of those three things.
[time=1369] And the song we're about to sing is called "Hurt by Hurt." And I want to assure you that God indeed will take those hurts and he will heal every single one of them.
[time=1388] [MUSIC]
[time=1405] Nobody saw, nobody noticed. Just how it started.
[time=1417] Wounds that were silent, wordless and cruel, tore me apart.
[time=1430] And nobody saw how I died.
[time=1437] Died inch by inch on the inside, hurt by hurt.
[time=1450] The painful memories waited in line, hurt by hurt.
[time=1464] I built them all, one hurt at a time.
[time=1478] Chantless raindrops, the good as morning, after the darkness.
[time=1492] Without a warning, love broke right through, invading my heart.
[time=1504] You walked hurt by hurt through my past, and you melted the barriers at last.
[time=1518] The painful memories waited in line, hurt by hurt.
[time=1538] You healed them all, one hurt at a time.
[time=1545] I prayed your name, and I'm so glad you came.
[time=1558] Oh Jesus, where would I be without you?
[time=1568] You knew, you knew that hurt by hurt.
[time=1579] The painful memories waited in line, hurt by hurt.
[time=1592] You healed them all, one hurt at a time.
[time=1659] I think it's a real blessing when you already have a cup that's flowing over by the time you get to the message.
[time=1666] I think that's what we experienced here this morning.
[time=1671] My family and I grew up in this area, but then we moved away and were away for 15 years.
[time=1677] One of the enjoyable things that I experienced when I came back was going to the Auburn Corps Duesenberg Festival.
[time=1685] Having been raised in the mid-50s to mid-60s, I'm kind of into the classic car era.
[time=1691] In fact, I have a 1964 two-door Chevrolet Super Sport, four on the floor, bucket seats, all of that, sitting in my garage.
[time=1700] That's about as much as I do with it, but I really enjoy doing that type of thing.
[time=1705] The first year back, we went to the car show, and I was kind of impressed with the fact that there was a Duesenberg there that had a price tag of a million plus.
[time=1716] The story behind that Duesenberg was that in the 1950s, someone had found just basically the shell of that Duesenberg in a junkyard in Chicago.
[time=1726] They took it out of that junkyard and restored it to its beauty and its luxury, making it worth that type of money today.
[time=1734] I'm sure some of you here can remember the term "boy, that's a doozy." That comes from the expression of seeing the awesomeness of a Duesenberg.
[time=1744] I found in our culture that we not only restore old cars, but we also are into restoring a lot of antiques.
[time=1753] That seems to be a national pastime.
[time=1756] I think as a culture, we're into about anything we can.
[time=1761] Putting it back to its original condition, restoring to what it once was, except our national pastime seems to fall a little short when it comes to restoring people.
[time=1773] Who have fallen, and their lives have been shattered and broken.
[time=1778] I'm speaking of Christians who have started out walking with the Lord, but then something has happened, and they find themselves faced down in life.
[time=1788] I'm not so sure at that point that we're quite as effective at restoring.
[time=1794] Many times, those people find themselves remaining broken and battered and in the junkyard of life.
[time=1801] And if they are restored, we basically restore them to a second-class citizenship.
[time=1807] And I'm really at a position to say if each one of us as individuals could get as excited about restoring human lives that have fallen and broken.
[time=1819] As we are about restoring furniture and cars and houses, I think we live in a drastically different world.
[time=1827] I'd like for you to turn in your Bibles to a very familiar passage of Scripture.
[time=1832] It's the book of Luke, and it's the story of the prodigal son.
[time=1838] Luke chapter 15, and I want to begin reading with verse 11.
[time=1845] And he said, "A certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me.'
[time=1855] And he divided his wealth between them. And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant country.
[time=1864] And there he squandered his estate with loose living.
[time=1867] Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to be in need.
[time=1872] And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
[time=1879] And he was longing to fill his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him.
[time=1885] But when he came to a census, he said, "How many of my father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger?
[time=1893] I will get up and go to my father and will say to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
[time=1900] I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.' And he got up and came to his father.
[time=1908] But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
[time=1915] And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.
[time=1920] I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' But the father said to his slaves, quickly bring out to the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet
[time=1930] and bring the fat and calf, kill it and let us eat and be married.
[time=1934] For this son of mine was dead and has come to life again. He was lost and has been found.
[time=1939] And they began to be married.
[time=1942] Restoring someone who has blown it in life. Someone who has fallen. Someone who started out with the Lord.
[time=1952] But then something happened and they found that they made shipwreck.
[time=1958] Now I believe there are a few Christians that are going to start out with the Lord and they'll make it from wire to wire without ever blowing it.
[time=1964] But I don't believe there are going to be that many.
[time=1968] And probably for most of us here this morning, we will either experience something like this or we will have a family member who experiences something like this
[time=1976] or we'll have a friend or someone that we know that finds themselves broken and faced down in life.
[time=1983] And I believe that we need to go through the process of restoration.
[time=1987] And it begins with this process of accepting forgiveness.
[time=1992] What happens to us when we blow it in life?
[time=1996] And by the way, I'm not talking here about missing daily devotionists.
[time=2000] I'm talking about those things that happen in our lives that just literally tear us apart within.
[time=2006] I think first of all, whenever we have that experience in our lives, we go through an emotional response.
[time=2013] And that emotional response goes a little bit like this.
[time=2017] You have a real sense of guilt and regret.
[time=2021] A real sense of having blown it brings guilt and regret.
[time=2025] The Bible says in verse 17, but when he came to his senses, he woke up and all of a sudden he realized what he had done.
[time=2034] And then from the sense of guilt and regret comes this sense of worthlessness.
[time=2039] I believe there are a lot of Christians who would honestly say this, I am what I was.
[time=2045] I am what I was because what I am right now is of no value.
[time=2050] I've lost my worth and my significance because I've blown it in life.
[time=2056] And then comes the third stage, the anger of being upset with self, the anger that says how could I have blown it?
[time=2068] I think there are mental responses that come when you come to your senses after having blown it in life.
[time=2075] And the first one is things can't go on this way.
[time=2079] I can't keep living this way. I can't keep doing this.
[time=2082] I can't keep in the same situation that I've been in, but then comes the second thought right behind it.
[time=2089] I can't go back to the way things were.
[time=2093] And so we come to the third point in the mental response, resignation to second class citizenship.
[time=2100] And I believe the churches are filled with Christians who have resigned themselves to second class citizenship.
[time=2107] Something has happened in their life and it's torn their lives apart.
[time=2111] And so now even though they are still involved with going to church, they're basically sitting back because they believe that they're no longer usable by God.
[time=2119] They are now second class citizens. There's no way back to restoration.
[time=2125] And they say to themselves if only it would have never happened.
[time=2131] I think the prodigal son must have said that to himself several times.
[time=2135] If only it would have never happened.
[time=2137] If only I could undo what's gone wrong.
[time=2140] If only the prodigal son could have seen the end from the beginning.
[time=2146] I think those are probably two of the saddest words in the English vocabulary.
[time=2151] If only. If only it had never happened.
[time=2156] I see what we tend to do is we tend to go through experiences in life where we fall face down and our lives are torn apart.
[time=2163] And we think that what we can do is just kind of bury that on the inside and with a little bit of time it'll go away.
[time=2169] Let me tell you something. Time doesn't heal anything. Time by itself is not a healing agent.
[time=2175] And that'll lay inside and hurt and tear you apart years down the road.
[time=2181] If only the prodigal could have seen the end from the beginning.
[time=2186] Several years ago now there was a movie that came out that ties into this whole idea.
[time=2191] And I wanted to see the movie for two reasons. The movie was Superman One.
[time=2196] Now one of the reasons I wanted to see that movie I grew up in the in the in the mid 50s that was on black and white TV.
[time=2202] Superman was my hero. I watched him as a little kid. So I wanted to go see my hero again.
[time=2207] But also wanted to go see it because at that time it became the number one box office seller in our culture.
[time=2215] And I was interested in why in the world a movie where a man artificially flies through the air would captivate our entire culture.
[time=2224] And you know I watched that movie all the way through and it wasn't until the last sequence in that movie that I began to understand why everybody was wanting to see that movie.
[time=2234] Lex Luthor the villain has Superman and bad condition his Kryptonite around his neck Superman is laying in a small shallow pool of water no strength whatsoever.
[time=2245] Lex Luthor's plan to take over the west coast is going to be achieved by releasing a missile to the east coast and simultaneously one to the west coast.
[time=2256] Now the missile going to the east coast was supposed to land on Hackensack New Jersey.
[time=2262] Now Lex Luthor's girlfriend's mother lived in Hackensack New Jersey.
[time=2266] So she made a deal with Superman she said if you promise to go to the one to the east coast and spare my mother's life she said I'll take the Kryptonite off your neck.
[time=2275] Superman made the deal flew to the east coast flung the missile into outer space it harmlessly explodes no damage.
[time=2284] But at the same time the one lands in California right on the Andreas fault and there are tragedies going on everywhere.
[time=2292] Superman is racing all over saving people saving a train from going off of a broken trestle saving a village where damn has broken and the waters are flooding down to destroy the village.
[time=2303] He's saving everyone now in the meantime Lois Lane you remember her she's Clark Kent's girlfriend some of your so young you don't even know about Superman.
[time=2313] She's driving through the desert right across where the Andreas fault is and as she's driving down the road the fault opens her car falls in the crevice the dirt rushes in through the open window Lois Lane suffocates and she dies.
[time=2334] And right after she dies Superman arrives on the scene pulls her out of the car and he holds her there and lets out this unmerciful scream in agony.
[time=2347] And then he laid her down and did what sold that movie to our entire culture.
[time=2353] He raced into outer space and he went around the globe backwards and he spun time backwards and then they show Lois Lane driving down that same road and just before the crevice opens up and swallows her car and she dies.
[time=2369] Superman comes underneath and puts the fault back together Lois Lane gets her car stopped and she lives.
[time=2378] And you know the vast majority of people in our culture would give anything if they could spend time backwards and make certain events come out right.
[time=2388] If only I could go back and turn it all around I would give an awful lot in my life if I had the ability to do that.
[time=2397] The problem is that only happens in the movies.
[time=2400] I think David would have done that had he had the opportunity after he got involved with Bathsheba and sent the letter out for Uriah's death.
[time=2410] And I think David was broken and torn apart by his realization of what he had done in his life. Psalm 3810 David said even the light has gone out of my eyes.
[time=2420] The twinkle is gone.
[time=2423] My life is faced down and I am broken and torn apart.
[time=2428] But this is not a story about failure. It's not a story about blowing it in life.
[time=2433] This story in Luke chapter 15 is not about sorrow and defeat.
[time=2437] Thank God it's a story of overwhelming victory. It's a story of beauty for ashes, a story of the oil of gladness instead of mourning.
[time=2445] As you see the story moves from the mistake from the failure from the sin to the recovery.
[time=2452] And it starts with the prodigal son having a brokenness over his sin.
[time=2457] And I really don't believe that there's any real freedom from sin. There's any real victory or restoration without that brokenness over sin.
[time=2465] Psalm 51 verse 17. A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise.
[time=2472] You see brokenness over sin is a sign of repentance. And as a pastor once said there is no disgrace in coming out of sin.
[time=2480] And yet I work with people and I've talked with people and I've been involved with people that once they get tangled up in things that are tearing their lives apart.
[time=2488] Somehow they don't have that sense of it's okay to come out of that sin. They feel trapped and they stay there.
[time=2494] Instead of confessing and admitting that they have blown it.
[time=2499] No rationalization, no blaming of others, no excuses, just plain simple truth, I blew it.
[time=2507] And I find a lot of Christians who never really get to the point of being able to work through, to confess, to get free from.
[time=2517] Many, many Christians carry secrets of things that have gone wrong in their lives. They carry them within 10, 15, 20 years.
[time=2526] And they're still tearing them apart. Let me tell you something. If you're carrying a secret this morning, it's the heaviest thing you'll ever pick up in your life.
[time=2535] It just keeps weighing you down. I'm sure some of you've heard this illustration but it's an excellent illustration for this point.
[time=2543] I heard it from Vance Havner years ago. He gave the story about two little children, a brother and a sister who went to visit grandma at the farm.
[time=2553] And in the afternoon they were out in the barnyard playing with the barnyard animals and little Johnny accidentally killed the barnyard duck.
[time=2562] And he was scared, he didn't know what to do, so he took the duck and he hit it in the wood pile.
[time=2567] Now Susie, his little sister, she's standing there and she's watching all of this.
[time=2572] A little bit later, grandma calls him into the house and says, "It's time to get ready for the evening meal." And she turns to Susie and she says, "Susie, I'd like for you to set the table." And Susie gets this little smile on her face and she says, "Oh, grandma, I think Johnny would like to set the table for me, wouldn't you, Johnny?"
[time=2590] And Johnny says, "Yeah, grandma, I'd like to do that." After the evening meal, grandma said, "Now Susie, since Johnny set the table, I think it's only right for you to clean things up."
[time=2601] And again, here comes the little smile and again Susie says, "But grandma, I think Johnny would like to do that, wouldn't you, Johnny?"
[time=2608] "Yeah, grandma, I would." And this went on for three days. Every time there was something to do, Johnny ended up doing it.
[time=2617] And finally, after three days of this blackmailing process, he couldn't handle it anymore.
[time=2622] So he went to grandma with tears, streaming down his face, he said, "Grandma," he said, "I've got to tell you something."
[time=2629] He said, "I didn't mean to do it, but he said the other day I was playing with the barnyard duck and I accidentally killed it and I put it in the wood pile because I was afraid."
[time=2638] And he says, "Susie saw me doing it and every since then I've had to do everything and I can't take it anymore."
[time=2645] And grandma put her arms around Johnny and she said, "Johnny, I want to tell you something." The other day, I was standing at the kitchen window and I saw you accidentally killed the barnyard duck and I saw you hide the duck in the wood pile and I knew Susie was doing this to you.
[time=2661] I just wondered how long you would allow this to go on before you came to me and told me what happened.
[time=2669] How long before you get free? How many ducks are in the wood pile?
[time=2676] How long before we experienced the restoration back to first class citizenship?
[time=2681] A brokenness over sin? It's a sign of repentance. It brings within an expectation, a judgment.
[time=2688] I like the idea in this passage in Luke 15 that the son went back expecting that the father was going to only take him back as a servant.
[time=2696] It wasn't this hardy attitude you owe me. You need to restore me.
[time=2701] It was going back in brokenness and humility and said, "Even if he only takes me back as a servant, that's just and that's righteous."
[time=2709] But there was also an acceptance of forgiveness on the part of this son.
[time=2715] I believe he was willing to take the father, it is word, and I find that's hard to do as Christians.
[time=2720] I find many Christians today, even though they know 1 John 1-9, if you confess your sin, he's faithful and just forgive your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.
[time=2729] I know that many Christians, even though they know that, do not actually believe that enough to live it.
[time=2734] Isaiah 1-18, "Come now, let us reason together, though your sin be a scarlet, it shall be white as snow, though it's red like crimson, it shall be as wool."
[time=2742] And I ask myself the question, "Why in the world is it so difficult for Christians to accept forgiveness, to really be free, to really be restored?"
[time=2752] And I've come up with at least three reasons.
[time=2755] I find one of them is pride. It's the type of pride that says, "I can't have done that."
[time=2761] I know that maybe someone else could have sinned that way or fallen that way or blown it that way, but not me.
[time=2769] My pride makes it difficult for me to accept forgiveness because it's an omission I really did do it.
[time=2776] Number two, I find it's hard to accept forgiveness because of a thing I call self-attonement.
[time=2783] I think most of us as Christians after we really blown in life believe that we have to somehow pay for our own sin.
[time=2792] I had a lady in her early 30s who came to me one time. She had been living in an alternate lifestyle from a Christian home.
[time=2801] And she came into my office and she said, "I am so tired of living this way and so tired of being out of step with God and so tired of living in sin."
[time=2809] She said, "I want freedom from this." And I said, "We can get that freedom to you."
[time=2816] And we worked on it for quite a while and she was right at the point of accepting the freedom and the real forgiveness and being able to enjoy life again.
[time=2824] And she came into my office one day and she said, "That's it." She said, "I'm not coming back anymore." She said, "I'm not going to keep working on this." She said, "I am feeling like I could really accept forgiveness and I can begin to smile and rejoice and enjoy life again."
[time=2838] And she said, "Then I became aware that if I do that, if I put a smile on my face someday somebody is going to walk up to me and say, "How in the world can you be so happy and so positive?"
[time=2847] "I know what you've done." And she said, "That would devastate me." She said, "I can't run that risk."
[time=2854] I told that young lady this. I said, "I'll tell you what, you go ahead and take the forgiveness and the victory.
[time=2861] You get free from all of this and you take my telephone number and if you ever run into that situation simply reply by saying here, please call this individual at this number and I'll vouch for the fact that you spent three years in major depression over what you went through."
[time=2877] Isn't it amazing how we believe that we have to somehow pay for our own sin.
[time=2882] Self-attonement.
[time=2884] We confess our sins and yet right after that we still carry the guilt. We confess again and we still feel it.
[time=2891] We're confessing two or three days later because somehow we really don't believe it's gone.
[time=2895] Teaching colleague of mine was talking about that area one day and he said, "You know, if you confess your sin before God."
[time=2901] He said, "God removes it and then if you come back and confess the same sin because you're still carrying a sense of guilt, God leans over the banister of heaven."
[time=2908] He says, "Carl, what are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about. You're sin and iniquity. I've remembered no more. That's gone."
[time=2915] The third reason I believe that it's tough to forgive ourselves is because we all believe in some form of double jeopardy.
[time=2924] How many of you've ever heard this whole idea that when we get to heaven our life is going to all go up on a screen and everybody's going to get to see it?
[time=2930] You ever heard of that?
[time=2931] I used to believe that.
[time=2933] I don't really believe it's scriptural, but one of the things I do in my seminars, I decided to try to dispel that.
[time=2940] So what I did in my seminar, I took slides of my own life and I did a first person.
[time=2947] God says, "Carl, so vine, this is your life. Come forward and reveal what's coming up on the screen."
[time=2953] Well, the first 18 slides on the screen were all white because I wasn't saved till I was 18 years of age.
[time=2960] And hardly any Christian will argue with the fact that before you're saved any sin that you commit goes under the blood of Christ and it's all washed whiter than snow.
[time=2970] And then up comes the first slide and back then I had long hair laid down. It was acceptable back then, okay?
[time=2979] And people see that slide of how I looked and there's a little bit of laughter and humor in that and I talk a little bit about what God was doing in my life at that point.
[time=2987] And then comes the next slide and my wife is wearing this yellow dress and this big yellow hat and that looks rather funny and everybody kind of enjoys that slide.
[time=2998] And I go through three or four slides talking about what was going on in my life and then here comes another white slide.
[time=3005] Lord, I remember what happened there.
[time=3008] I remember how I fell flat on my face. I remember the sin that I committed.
[time=3012] But you have taken that sin as casted as far as the east is from the west and I'm free from that and I thank you for that and I go on to the next slide.
[time=3020] And after four or five slides of what's been going on in my life then here come two more white slides.
[time=3027] And you know when I do that in a seminar most people start out laughing and they see the hairstyles and they see the clothes and it's an enjoyable time.
[time=3034] We're all having a good time here.
[time=3036] But about halfway through they begin to realize the point.
[time=3041] And I tell them when it's all over even though I don't believe that'll ever happen.
[time=3045] If it did happen I believe we'll experience two things.
[time=3048] Number one would be an enjoyable time.
[time=3051] And number two, every time a white slide came up after I was saved you all wondered what in the world I did and your curiosity got the best of you.
[time=3060] And I said if this happens in heaven you're just going to have to learn to live with your curiosity because God's not going to tell you what I did and neither am I.
[time=3067] It's been removed. It's gone.
[time=3071] You know I often wondered how did we get under this idea that we had to pay double jeopardy that even though we confessed and repented of the sin we're still going to pay the price.
[time=3081] And I was playing at that time I was playing softball for a church team.
[time=3086] And the twins my twin boys were about seven or eight years of age at that time and they would go with me the softball games.
[time=3092] And I told them you don't have to sit in the bleachers you can go anywhere in the softball complex except stay out of the woods.
[time=3100] And right before a game began one day I was looking around I couldn't find the boys and I saw some children over in the tree line so I ran across the open field there my boys right inside the tree line.
[time=3109] And I said to them boys you disobeyed me you need to come back and sit in the bleachers and don't move till the game's over.
[time=3115] And after the game was over we got in the car and first thing I said to them I said guys because you disobeyed me you can't come back to the softball games with me anymore.
[time=3124] And we hadn't gotten even a block out of that part till one of them with all the brokenness and sincerity you'd ever hear in a little boy's heart was saying as he was crying dad.
[time=3132] I'm sorry I disobeyed will you forgive me.
[time=3136] And this is what I said in return to that little boy.
[time=3140] I said son I forgive you but you still can't come back to the softball games with me anymore.
[time=3146] Now I've never heard God audibly speak but that's about as close as I came because right after that God was like God tapped me on the shore and he said you've been wondering where this idea that even though you confess your sin you still have to pay for it comes from.
[time=3157] You just build it into that little boy's mind.
[time=3160] And at that point I turned back to him and I said you know because you really repented you were really sorry that you disobeyed you can come back to the softball games with me again.
[time=3169] Now the other little guy he hadn't said a word this whole time but when he saw how well that worked he decided he'd try the same thing.
[time=3178] You see I really don't believe that once you confess and turn from repent of your sin I don't believe that you ever have to pay a spiritual or nor should you pay a mental emotional consequence for your sin.
[time=3192] You may have to deal with physical consequence and social or relational consequence but let me tell you something if I'm free spiritually before God and I'm restored to first class citizenship
[time=3204] and if I'm free in my own mental emotional state knowing that my slate is clean and I'm forgiven and I'm restored to first class citizenship I can handle the social or the physical consequences of sin.
[time=3218] The Bible says that Noah was drunken and yet Noah made the Old Testament Hall of Faith in Hebrews 11.
[time=3224] Moses directly disobeyed God's order and yet he was one on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[time=3230] David committed adultery and murder and yet after he repented the Bible says of David in the book of Acts in the New Testament he's a man after God's own heart.
[time=3238] Peter outright denied Christ but he became the basis of the New Testament church and I believe that God's designed for all believers is to give them the beauty for ashes.
[time=3247] The oil of blandness instead of morning.
[time=3250] As the psalmist says weeping may last for the night but a shout of joy comes in the morning and it's all because of God's amazing grace.
[time=3259] Now I know none of you out there can see it but I have a scar across the knuckle of this thumb.
[time=3266] I can remember how that thumb was torn apart.
[time=3270] I can recall it happened 1981 I can recall digging a stone out of the yard one that took both my hands to pick it up and as I went to throw the stone it had a razor edge that was buried in the ground that I wasn't aware of and it sliced that knuckle wide open.
[time=3284] I can relive and recall today everything that I experienced there with that brokenness and that tearing I can recall the blood going everyplace I can recall going to the emergency room getting it scrubbed out getting the shots to make sure it was numb.
[time=3298] I can recall the doctor putting in the stitches and taking taking out the stitches a couple of weeks later but you know when I look at that scar rather than reliving and re hurting all of that pain I look at that scar and I rejoice in the healing.
[time=3314] Thank God it's healed it was broken it was torn but it's healed and I rejoice in that healing.
[time=3324] I ran into a cartoon strip several years ago it's a cartoon strip with Garfield a good old Indiana kid.
[time=3332] Garfield's in a pet store and he realizes that all of these pets are imprisoned they're all caged and Garfield goes around and he sets all of the animals free.
[time=3343] He throws open the cage doors and he keeps shouting you're free you're free.
[time=3351] And when he gets every cage door open he turns around and looks and none of the animals have moved they're all shuttering in their cages.
[time=3362] This folks must not be into freedom these days and so he goes back and he slams all of the cages shut re-imprisoned them and shouts you're secure you're secure.
[time=3379] And a lot of people are living with a lot of brokenness in their lives that happened years ago but they're too afraid to step out and to experience the freedom and the victory that is provided by God.
[time=3391] He stored the first class citizenships to put a smile on their face and go on with life and say I'm free.
[time=3399] We'd rather live with the brokenness and the pain because at least we know where we are there we have that sense of security.
[time=3410] I think all Christians need to experience the phrase that came from Martin Luther King Jr. when he gave his speech in Washington DC free at last.
[time=3425] Thank God Almighty free at last. If you're here this morning and you're carrying things in your life or your life has been torn apart or if you have a child a teenager an adult child whose life has been torn apart.
[time=3440] There is a way to restore and to restore to first class citizenship to experience the victory that God has provided so that someday they too or you too will be able to cry free at last free at last.
[time=3460] Thank God Almighty free at last. I want my children to know this message. I have a 21 year old son and I want him to know Todd I don't ever want you to blow it in life but if you do I want you to know.
