[time=0] (mysterious music)
[time=60] - Thank you very much for tuning in to the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=84] Today's program that you will see is recorded on Easter Sunday, that's one of my very favorite Sundays as we worship the risen Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=94] I have the opportunity to describe to you right now what will be taking place in just a few moments on the Bible Hour.
[time=101] As you that have watched every week know that we have an interlude in the middle of our program, we'll not be doing that today because of the nature of our program.
[time=109] We're going to begin and talk to you as well as sing to you about the events from Palm Sunday to the resurrection a week later.
[time=117] You must realize that there were unbelievable circumstances and different amounts of stress on each person as they reacted to Jesus coming into the city
[time=126] with the great anticipation of the Messiah finally coming, and then just a few days later realizing that Jesus was dead.
[time=134] And what a sad day that was, but for us when He said, "Tis finished," we realized that that was just the beginning.
[time=141] Because Jesus said, "Tis finished," meaning that He had carried across those events that would assure us of our salvation.
[time=149] So as you watch today, I hope that you will realize that Jesus Christ is a risen Savior, and that there are things in this world that draw us to material things.
[time=158] We are thankful that Jesus Christ alone, through His death and resurrection, give us eternal life and assure us of heaven to come.
[time=167] And we're delighted that you've joined with us today, and I hope that this will be a very special presentation for you,
[time=173] and we'll be a blessing in your life.
[time=176] And now we will begin with the musical entitled "Crown Him with Many Crowns,"
[time=182] presented by our sanctuary choir and orchestra.
[time=197] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=390] In the midst of the parade and the praises, only Jesus knew where the path of palms would lead him.
[time=396] Deliberately, he washed their feet, teaching them humility by his humility.
[time=402] Gently he spoke the mysteries of his invisible kingdom, teaching them love by his love.
[time=409] But we were slow to understand.
[time=412] [MUSIC]
[time=423] You do not see, you do not understand it now.
[time=430] You look for signs, you search the skies above.
[time=436] Yet I say again, my kingdom is within, whereby my spirit, I will reign in love.
[time=454] Oh, sir, then a heartbeat, I will be through you.
[time=462] Oh, sir, then a heartbeat, in everything you do,
[time=471] nearer than the breath you take, when you sleep and when you wake,
[time=479] ever, never to forsake my own.
[time=486] I'll be closer than a heartbeat.
[time=491] Oh, sir, then a heartbeat, or your heart will be my home.
[time=500] [MUSIC]
[time=503] Or like a seed that's sewn into the fallow ground.
[time=511] He comes a tree with branches wide and strong, I will sow in you.
[time=521] I'll love that grows and blooms, and fills your silent spirit with my soul.
[time=535] Oh, sir, then a heartbeat, I will be through you.
[time=543] Oh, sir, then a heartbeat, in everything you do,
[time=552] nearer than the breath you take, when you sleep and when you wake,
[time=559] ever, never to forsake my own.
[time=567] I'll be closer than a heartbeat.
[time=572] Oh, sir, then a heartbeat, for your heart will be my home.
[time=581] [MUSIC]
[time=587] I'll be closer than a heartbeat.
[time=593] Oh, sir, then a heartbeat, for your heart will be my home.
[time=612] [MUSIC]
[time=620] Jesus' earthly ministry was rapidly drawing to a close, and after the last supper, Jesus went out to get seminy.
[time=629] He was an agonizing time of waiting, just a few hours left, hours of infinite loneliness between freedom and suffering.
[time=638] Then came the betrayer's kiss, the guards took him away.
[time=643] [MUSIC]
[time=655] I was there when they brought him to the chargement hall.
[time=663] I, the centurion at Pilate's instant call,
[time=670] a leader of Romans trained as fighting men.
[time=677] I, the centurion, had a Pilate man.
[time=685] [MUSIC]
[time=692] Hand of courage, man of skill.
[time=697] Hand of battle, trained to kill.
[time=703] Hand with skill and sword and shield, bearing stars from battle field.
[time=714] [MUSIC]
[time=720] I was there when they brought him to the chargement hall.
[time=728] This conflict woman did follow her to call.
[time=735] This prisoner, this malefactor,
[time=742] this Jesus so called care.
[time=751] Then to Pilate him.
[time=760] [MUSIC - 486 seconds]
[time=1252] It was the morning before Pan Am Flight 103 would leave Frankfurt, West Germany on its way back to the United States.
[time=1263] On that day before 270 passengers were rejoicing with the anticipation of going home for the holidays.
[time=1272] Some of them were soldiers in service to the United States.
[time=1275] They were stationed in West Germany.
[time=1278] They were looking forward to coming home, to seeing wives that they hadn't seen for so many months.
[time=1284] Some were looking forward to coming home and seeing children that had been born while they were on their tour of duty.
[time=1292] The soldiers were looking forward to seeing moms and dads and brothers and sisters.
[time=1298] There would also be on that flight students coming back to spend a Christmas break.
[time=1304] Finished with final exams, they joyously looked forward to the time of a break and just a time to relax and enjoy life
[time=1313] before they would return to their studies.
[time=1316] Across the ocean, parents and family members were filled with happiness and joy as they looked forward
[time=1322] to sons and daughters coming home to spend the holidays with them.
[time=1328] But the next day as Pan Am Flight 103 left Frankfurt, West Germany, it wasn't long until over Lockerbie, Scotland, a terrorist bomb exploded
[time=1339] and hundreds of passengers lost their lives.
[time=1343] One day they were looking forward with joyous anticipation to the joy that would be there as the following day.
[time=1353] But as the news came to the loved ones who waited on the other side of the ocean, happiness turned to tears.
[time=1363] Joy turned to agony and hearts full of anticipation of a joyful time turned to emptiness, trauma and agony.
[time=1378] What a difference a day can make.
[time=1382] What a difference one day in our lives can make.
[time=1387] This morning the choir has been presenting the story of our Lord.
[time=1392] We have reached the point where he has gone to the cross and has suffered and he has died.
[time=1398] On that Friday morning Jerusalem was ablaze with emotion, with emotion, with vengeance, with hatred, with tears.
[time=1409] It was filled with emotion throughout.
[time=1413] Everyone knew what was happening. Everyone had an opinion.
[time=1419] The word spread into the marketplace, the word spread into the homes and shops throughout Jerusalem.
[time=1425] Have you heard? They've crucified the Galilean.
[time=1430] Have you heard the Nazarene is being put to death?
[time=1434] Have you heard? It was his own man who betrayed him.
[time=1441] Soon an earthquake would take place and graves would burst open.
[time=1445] The temple veil would be rent from top to bottom.
[time=1449] Jerusalem was ablaze on that Friday.
[time=1453] But just one day before the Jews had been celebrating the Feast of Passover.
[time=1460] They had been going about their religious duty, joyfully looking forward to the Passover Feast.
[time=1467] It was a happy time as they commemorated their freedom from bondage in Egypt
[time=1473] and the fact that they had been let out and they gave thanks to God for that freedom.
[time=1479] Happiness and joy, but the following day, hatred, emotion, vengeance, anger.
[time=1487] What a difference one day can make.
[time=1492] What about the lives of the biblical characters which we have read and heard so much about?
[time=1498] What about Mary, the mother of our Lord?
[time=1502] The day before she had prepared a Passover Feast for her family.
[time=1507] She had looked forward with anticipation and happiness toward the celebration, having her family there.
[time=1515] But on that Friday morning she stood three feet from the cross looking up at the torn punctured body of her son.
[time=1525] What a difference one day can make.
[time=1533] Or Peter and John the day before had been sent to the upper room by Jesus to prepare the Passover Feast.
[time=1540] Jesus has said go there, prepare the feast and then the other disciples and myself will come later in the day.
[time=1547] We will celebrate together.
[time=1549] Peter and John had gone to prepare the meal.
[time=1552] They looked forward to the fellowship.
[time=1554] They looked forward to the time of being with their Lord.
[time=1558] Or it was going to be a time of great fellowship of great joy.
[time=1563] Peter didn't know that before the day was out the following day,
[time=1569] he would deny his Lord three times.
[time=1573] John who the Bible says Jesus loved, the beloved disciple as he prepared that meal,
[time=1582] did not know that the following day he would be anointing and preparing the corpse of his Messiah.
[time=1590] What a difference a day can make.
[time=1594] Or Pontius Pilate as he stood the day before as the procurator over all of Judea.
[time=1601] Oh he was a government official, he was famous in his territory, he was well known by all of those in his kingdom.
[time=1610] But you know Pilate the day before would have passed from the scene had he died.
[time=1617] Few would have ever have remembered the name Pontius Pilate.
[time=1622] Oh he was well known in his day, but his name would not be remembered in the pages of Scripture,
[time=1629] would not be remembered in the history books or in the classrooms of today.
[time=1634] But you see the next day on that Friday morning, Pilate passed judgment on the very Son of God.
[time=1642] What a difference one day can make in a life.
[time=1650] No one in Jerusalem was untouched that morning.
[time=1655] There was no neutrality when it came to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1659] They looked at him on the cross and they either weaved because their Messiah had died.
[time=1665] Or they ridiculed through stones or spit on him because they didn't believe that he was the Messiah.
[time=1676] There was no neutrality on that Friday in Jerusalem.
[time=1681] No neutrality.
[time=1683] But you know as we look back on that event, 1900 years later as we look back to the cross we can see
[time=1694] that either people were compelled to come to the cross or they were repelled away from the cross.
[time=1703] The same is true for all of us today as we sit here.
[time=1708] Many of you are in town today, you're visiting with relatives and friends.
[time=1713] You're anticipating a great time on this Easter Sunday.
[time=1717] Perhaps yesterday you visited together, you drove over from another city or state.
[time=1722] You look forward with great joy and anticipation to this time together with your family.
[time=1728] Oh, we pray here today that you've had a great time of fellowship with loved ones.
[time=1734] And I pray that yesterday was a great day for you in your life.
[time=1738] One of those great times when we share those moments that God gives us together with family.
[time=1745] But this morning, as we have heard the choir sing and the word proclaimed,
[time=1752] I would remind us all that we can't be neutral toward the cross.
[time=1758] Just as all who stood before the cross over 1900 years ago had to make a decision,
[time=1764] had to determine who that Jesus Christ was who was crucified on the cross.
[time=1771] The fact that they had to either accept Him as Messiah or reject Him as something less than the Son of God.
[time=1780] That same choice is ours.
[time=1782] This morning, it's ours today.
[time=1787] This morning, God looks down and He tells us again as He reminds us on this Easter Sunday.
[time=1794] I gave my Son willingly.
[time=1797] I gave my Son that He might come, live for you, and then die on the cross in your place that you might have everlasting life.
[time=1809] Perhaps yesterday was a day for you of celebration. I pray that it was.
[time=1814] But today, as you come to our service this morning, I would pray more than anything else,
[time=1822] that if it has not been your privilege and joy to reach out to the cross,
[time=1828] to receive Christ as your Savior and as the Lord of your life, that you would make that decision this morning.
[time=1835] You see, not only in the days of Jerusalem, the day of the crucifixion,
[time=1841] not only in the time of Mary and Pilate and Peter and John, but today, what a difference a day can make.
[time=1851] What a difference just one day can make.
[time=1858] The Bible teaches and says that God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son,
[time=1868] that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1875] What a day, what a difference a day can make.
[time=1884] God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son,
[time=1912] that whoso believeth beeth in Him should not perish,
[time=1930] should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=1942] For God said that His Son into the world, to God and the world.
[time=1964] But that the world through Him might be saved.
[time=1978] God so loved the world,
[time=1988] that He gave His only begotten Son,
[time=2005] that whoso believeth beeth in Him should not perish,
[time=2023] should not perish but have everlasting life.
[time=2033] Ever lasting life, ever lasting life.
[time=2053] God so loved the world.
