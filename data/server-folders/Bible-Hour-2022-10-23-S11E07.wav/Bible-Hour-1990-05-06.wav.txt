[time=30] - In 1982, a book was published entitled, "In Search of Excellence."
[time=48] The book was an instant runaway bestseller.
[time=51] The book was a study of the best-run American corporations, and the book explained the various principles that these companies had in common.
[time=59] American businessmen searching for excellence embraced the book.
[time=64] But you know today Americans are in search of excellence in many areas of their lives.
[time=69] They're in search of excellence in personal finance, in personal fitness, and of course in their own personal business.
[time=76] But you know the Bible teaches that we are to be in search of excellence in one other area.
[time=81] That is the area of our Christian life.
[time=84] Oh, if you're a believer today, it's great to be in search of excellence in our personal fitness, our personal business, or our personal finance.
[time=92] But are you in search of excellence in the area of your Christian life?
[time=97] (music playing)
[time=107] - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=113] Thank you for joining us.
[time=115] Today's message will be brought to us by Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=119] He has entitled his message, "In Search of Excellence." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Philippians chapter 1.
[time=128] We will be looking at verses 9 through 11.
[time=131] Our special music today includes a solo from Marilyn Wong, a song from Reflection, and Denise Mitchell.
[time=142] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "Crown Him with Many Crowns." (music playing)
[time=172] (music playing)
[time=381] (applause) - We serve a risen Savior. He's in the world today. He lives.
[time=390] I know he lives within my heart.
[time=392] Him number 220, a song of personal testimony.
[time=395] Let's sing it together as we believe indeed that Christ is our Savior.
[time=399] 220, we'll sing verses 1 and 3.
[time=403] (music playing)
[time=541] Amen. Thank you for your very good singing.
[time=543] We continue in music now as we draw our attention to Marilyn Wong and she sings for us a song that will inspire us.
[time=549] Let's listen as we sing, as we hear her sing about Jesus Christ.
[time=554] (music playing)
[time=699] - Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=702] I have with me in the studio our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson. Good morning Jim.
[time=706] - Good morning Pete. It's always a pleasure to be with you.
[time=708] - Jim, in just a few moments you'll be preaching the morning message.
[time=711] Tell us a little bit about the content of your message.
[time=713] - Pete, I'm very excited about the message this morning.
[time=716] I've titled it in search of Christian excellence.
[time=719] You know American Christians today are pursuing excellence in many areas of their lives.
[time=723] Personal finance, personal fitness, perhaps even personal business.
[time=727] But you know the Bible teaches that we are to also be in search of excellence in our Christian life.
[time=733] And that's what I'm preaching about today Pete.
[time=735] - Jim, I'm looking forward to the message. Thank you for joining me today here.
[time=739] And we are also very thankful that you have indicated that you're watching the Bible Hour by writing to us.
[time=745] We've had many letters this week and in particular we've had a lot of prayer requests.
[time=749] And Jim in our staff meeting last week we had a good time in sharing the requests that have come in through the Bible Hour
[time=755] and praying for each one of those requests.
[time=757] - Pete, that was a pleasure to see that people are writing to us and asking us to join in prayer with them.
[time=763] Well I hope that many of your requests have been answered and God has been helpful in your particular circumstance throughout this last week.
[time=771] If you're watching the Bible Hour today it's one week delayed so this is Mother's Day.
[time=775] And if you're watching in the Fort Wayne area you still have time to get up and get ready and join us for our worship service
[time=781] in the sanctuary of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=784] I hope that you'll do that.
[time=786] And looking ahead on May 20th we will have as our special guest Dr. David Burnham.
[time=791] He'll be speaking in our morning worship service and then he'll be here for our special graduation ceremonies for the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=799] That's going to be a great week and I hope that you will stay tuned for Dr. Burnham's message.
[time=805] Jim you've been preaching on Sunday evenings also.
[time=808] We've had a series of messages and you have a booklet that you've prepared entitled Confronting Casual Christianity.
[time=815] What is the content of that book?
[time=817] Well Peter bought a month or so maybe two months ago.
[time=820] I read a book called Hot Tub Religion by an American theologian by the name of J.I. Packer.
[time=825] And in that book J.I. Packer said that he thinks that American Christianity has turned into kind of a hot tub religion.
[time=832] We want it to feel good, we want it to be relaxing, we want it to be casual.
[time=836] And so as I thought about that I came up with the idea of writing this booklet called Confronting Casual Christianity.
[time=842] It's a challenge to total commitment, a challenge to commit ourselves to Jesus Christ.
[time=847] Well Jim while we're grateful for the ministry of the Bible Hour because there are so many shut-ins that are out there that can't come.
[time=854] We are also encouraging those that are watching and can fellowship in local churches to do that.
[time=860] And we'd like to make this booklet available to you so you can receive Confronting Casual Christianity by writing to the Bible Hour today.
[time=868] That's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=887] We hope that we will hear from you today and throughout this week, write us and tell us that you are watching the Bible Hour, we'd appreciate that very much.
[time=895] We go back now to the live portion of our service as we listen to the Reflection Minister to us singing "Come and Worship."
[time=925] We'll call to every tribal nation, worship you.
[time=931] The land who sits upon the crown, come and worship.
[time=937] Royal priesthood, come and praise Him.
[time=943] Holy nation, show forth His grace, show forth His power.
[time=953] This is the day, this is the hour, for this is the day that the Lord has made, let us enjoy it to declare.
[time=967] All rise, rise, worship Him, and bow before His throne.
[time=978] All rise, rise, lift your voice, and make a story known, come and worship.
[time=993] Royal priesthood, come and praise Him.
[time=999] Holy nation, show forth His grace, show forth His power.
[time=1009] This is the day, this is the hour, for this is the day that the Lord has made, let us enjoy it to declare.
[time=1022] Coming to His grace, with thanksgiving in your heart, enter His course with grace.
[time=1034] For this is the time and the hour, as a kingdom of priests we will reign, come and worship.
[time=1049] Royal priesthood, come and praise Him.
[time=1055] Holy nation, show forth His grace, show forth His power.
[time=1065] This is the day, this is the hour, for this is the day that the Lord has made, let us enjoy it to declare.
[time=1078] For this is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and make love.
[time=1095] Father, thank you this morning that we might come to worship.
[time=1100] Remind us again of what our duty is to you.
[time=1104] Father, through the words of the songs that have been sung today, through the words of the hymns, so many great truths have come back to us this morning.
[time=1112] Thank you for that great grace that was poured down upon us that we might have everlasting life.
[time=1119] Thank you for that reminder that we are to come and worship, that we are indeed a royal priesthood.
[time=1124] Oh Father, thank you for that.
[time=1126] Thank you for the way that you have ministered to us already today.
[time=1130] And Father, thank you this morning that we can come to your throne.
[time=1133] Come with praise, come with thanksgiving, but also come with prayer requests for those who lie in beds of affliction today.
[time=1141] Father, I would thank you for successful surgery this week for Chuck Hughes.
[time=1146] Father, I would thank you that you gave wisdom to doctors, that you provided technology that a heart could be repaired.
[time=1153] Father, I would just pray for the family, that you would give them comfort, you would give them strength.
[time=1157] I pray that you would help Chuck to be up and about as soon as possible, back with his family and friends again.
[time=1163] Father, I thank you for successful surgery for Genevieve Lowering.
[time=1167] Father, I thank you that Don Broad could be home again with friends, home, where she's comfortable after a few weeks in the hospital.
[time=1175] And Father, most of all this morning, I would just thank you for new life in the Bland family.
[time=1179] Thank you for a new baby. Thank you for the joy that can be ours as we dedicate this beautiful child to your service in your life.
[time=1187] Thank you for a Christian home that a child could be raised up in the nurture and admonition of your word.
[time=1193] Father, we just come this morning, give you all the glory, ask you to bless the word as it's proclaimed, ask you to bless the singers as they sing.
[time=1201] Father, thank you for the way that you've met with us. In Christ's name, amen.
[time=1231] When no word would rain, emotions run together in a flood of doubt and pain, we pray as best we can.
[time=1253] Now we must leave it in. Yet I know when my eyes fail to see, he's able.
[time=1274] And even though it seems impossible to me, he is able.
[time=1291] For if he chooses not to move in the way we pray to hold, comfort in his working altogether for our good, I will stand behind his word for his neighbor.
[time=1321] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=1334] Questions seem to haunt us night and day.
[time=1343] How could God allow my heart be torn this way? Does he listen when I call?
[time=1359] Is he even there at all? Yet I know when my eyes fail to see, he is able.
[time=1380] And even though it seems impossible to me, he is able.
[time=1396] For if he chooses not to move in the way we pray to hold, comfort in his working altogether for our good, I will stand behind his word for his neighbor.
[time=1425] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=1445] To place another day, and I will stand behind his word for his neighbor.
[time=1462] He is able, he is able, he is able.
[time=1482] Indeed, he is able. He is able to give us everlasting life. He is able in the twinkling of an eye to change a heart, to transform a life, to give us everlasting life and all eternity with him.
[time=1494] Oh, indeed, he is able. He is able today to comfort hearts if you are here today and you are hurting. He is here today to give you strength.
[time=1503] Father, in your word this morning we have already seen the blessings that you give us in this life.
[time=1509] Thank you so much for your word. Bless us now as we proclaim it in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1515] It has indeed been a joy in the time over the last several weeks to continue as one of the pastors here at Blackhawk and to have the opportunity to minister to you.
[time=1525] It has just been a joy to have the opportunity to take God's Word to open it and to share the truth, the rich and deep truths of it.
[time=1533] We had a good time in the first service. We had a sparrow that was fluttering around back and forth around the front. I believe he is gone.
[time=1540] I told the congregation I have always known that Pete Coby had bats in his belfry, but I did not know there was a sparrow in his worship center.
[time=1548] If you have a Bible with you this morning, I would like you to turn with me to the first chapter of the Book of Philippians, the first chapter of the Book of Philippians.
[time=1557] And I want to speak to you this morning on the subject in search of Christian excellence, in search of Christian excellence.
[time=1566] Many of us in America today are searching for excellence, excellence in our lives, excellence in our business, excellence in our personal finances, excellence in our business life.
[time=1580] But the Bible teaches that we are also to seek excellence in our Christian living.
[time=1587] The year was 1982. A book came out that year, an epic work that would go on to sell more than two and a half million copies.
[time=1601] The book was all in search of excellence. The book was written by two men who had taken years to study the very best of American corporations.
[time=1612] They had studied those corporations with the purpose of trying to see, trying to find out what it was that made those companies so successful.
[time=1623] As they studied, they learned that there were certain principles, certain practices that successful corporations used.
[time=1631] And as they implemented them into their business, they were able to achieve excellence in Christian living.
[time=1641] And so as a result, they achieved excellence in their businesses. Since that time, many more books have come out showing how we can receive excellence in business.
[time=1652] How corporations and business management, they will study, can learn to have excellence in their business.
[time=1660] But you know, it doesn't stop there. No matter whatever it is, no matter what it might be.
[time=1666] If you're looking for excellence in an area of your life, someone has a prescription that if you will follow will give you that excellence.
[time=1675] It doesn't just have to be a book like in search of excellence, but if you go into the bookstores today, if you read the papers, if you watch television, you will see that no matter what it is, that you're trying to achieve excellence in, someone has a prescription for you.
[time=1691] If you're trying to achieve excellence in your personal finance, if you watch television, you will find that there are many gurus on television who are there to help you to achieve that success.
[time=1702] They will tell you that if you read their books, if you listen to their tapes, if you come to their seminar, you can receive excellence in your personal finances.
[time=1713] Now you'll notice it's usually in real estate, it's always with no money down, except of course for the $400 for the books and tapes in the seminar.
[time=1723] But the fact of the matter is someone out there is trying to help you achieve excellence in your area of finances.
[time=1730] And then if it happens to be in the area of physical fitness, one just needs to turn on the television and you can see various product line that's out there to help you.
[time=1739] Treadmills and stationary bikes and health spots, which advertise their words.
[time=1744] And then of course there are the ever present diet supplements, which you can take, which will help you achieve excellence in weight control.
[time=1751] There's some that I really enjoy, but one product is called Calban.
[time=1755] A man comes on and talks about how he lost 160 pounds using Calban, and just the very title of that product gives you the idea that the calories will be forever banned from your body.
[time=1766] If you eat their product, if you use their product, then there was another one that I saw one day.
[time=1771] It didn't last very long, but it was called dream away. That was my favorite.
[time=1775] You could lose five to seven pounds, you could just dream it away by taking this product and then going to bed at night.
[time=1781] That sounded like a good one if it really worked.
[time=1784] Well, someone out there is looking to give you a prescription.
[time=1789] Someone is out there helping you achieve excellence in your personal life, no matter what it might be in.
[time=1796] But you know the Bible teaches in the book of Philippians, and Paul proclaims to us this morning that we are also to put that same effort or more into achieving excellence in our Christian life.
[time=1809] Excellence in our Christian living, in verses nine through eleven of that first chapter of Philippians this morning, I would like us to see three ingredients of Paul's prescription for Christian excellence.
[time=1823] Three ingredients that if we will take from the words of scripture and apply them to our hearts and our lives, then we can achieve excellence on not perfection, but we can achieve excellence in Christian living.
[time=1837] In verses nine through eleven Paul writes, and this is my prayer, that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory of God.
[time=1861] In verse nine and in the first portion of verse ten, I would like to point out first of all the first ingredient in that prescription, and that is we are to have excellence in our love.
[time=1872] Excellence in our love for our fellow man, excellence in our love for God, excellence in our love for our brothers and sisters in Christ, excellence in our love for those who we reach out to, who may not be believers.
[time=1887] In that verse Paul begins to speak about the importance of love.
[time=1892] Christ taught that there were many virtues, but that the most important of all virtues was that of love.
[time=1899] He spoke about people having faith, having hope, having love, but he said the most important of these is love.
[time=1908] In first Corinthians Paul wrote, "If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, but have not love, I gain nothing.
[time=1921] Love is the most important of all the virtues." Jesus said that love is the great identification mark of all Christians.
[time=1929] It is the thing that we are to be known by in our Christian life, that love is evidenced in us each day.
[time=1937] How important was love to the Apostle Paul? He wrote about it often.
[time=1941] In the introductions to many of his epistles, study them and see how many times Paul refers to the importance of love in the Christian life.
[time=1949] In 2 Thessalonians he wrote, "We ought always to thank God for you brothers, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love every one of you has for the other is increasing.
[time=1961] It was important to him." In Ephesians he writes, "I, since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus, and your love for all the saints have prayed for you continually."
[time=1974] Yes, it was very important to Paul, but he doesn't just stop there.
[time=1979] Paul doesn't just say that we are to have love and drop it at that.
[time=1983] He gives us some very clear and concise instruction on what is to make up that love that we show to all those around us.
[time=1991] And if we are to achieve excellence in our love, we need to heed what Paul says.
[time=1996] First of all, Paul says that love is to abound more and more.
[time=2001] It is to be abounding.
[time=2004] The idea that's being taught there is that of a river overflowing its banks.
[time=2010] The idea is that of a torrential rain that swells up a river, causes it to overflow its banks and spread to all the area around it.
[time=2019] Paul says that our love is to abound more and more.
[time=2022] It's not to be a trickle.
[time=2024] It's not just to be a little stream.
[time=2026] It's to abound in greatness overflowing its banks flowing to touch all those who are around us.
[time=2033] In many ways, Paul is saying I pray that you might be more loving.
[time=2037] That more and more you might be characterized by love.
[time=2040] A love that is dynamic and growing.
[time=2043] A love that is never static.
[time=2045] A love that is abounding and reaching out to others.
[time=2050] Yes, it is to be abounding.
[time=2054] Let's take a moment though and define what Paul means by the word love.
[time=2059] I believe that a good concise definition of love is this.
[time=2062] When a person acts in order that another may benefit.
[time=2068] That is love.
[time=2070] When a person acts in order that another one may benefit.
[time=2075] That is love reaching out.
[time=2077] The greatest example of that is God looking down from heaven, giving his son Jesus Christ.
[time=2084] For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
[time=2091] The ultimate act of abounding love.
[time=2095] Yes, it is to be abounding.
[time=2097] But then notice as he goes on in verse 9 he says that it is to abound more and more but he doesn't stop there.
[time=2103] He said it is to abound in knowledge and depth of insight.
[time=2108] Now what does that mean?
[time=2110] Knowledge and depth of insight.
[time=2112] What Paul is saying here that our love is to abound.
[time=2116] It is to be poured out.
[time=2118] It is to go to all of those who are around us.
[time=2121] But it is to go under control.
[time=2124] Even though it overflows its banks it is always to be under the control of the word of God.
[time=2131] It is to be under the control of the wisdom and the insight that we receive from a study of God's word.
[time=2139] When he says it is to abound in knowledge he is talking about having a mental grasp of the spiritual truth
[time=2146] that we learn from a systematic study of God's word.
[time=2151] It is the understanding of biblical standards.
[time=2156] And so when our love abounds more and more, Paul is saying it is to abound, oh yes, but it is to abound within the realm of biblical teaching within the realm of biblical standards.
[time=2169] It is to abound in knowledge according to what the Bible teaches.
[time=2174] And then secondly he says it is to abound yes but in knowledge and depth of insight.
[time=2181] That word there really means with good judgment.
[time=2184] Paul is saying that we are to use discernment.
[time=2187] We are to use judgment.
[time=2189] We are to take the knowledge that we have here in our study of God's word.
[time=2194] We are to take it and to make decisions and judgments with insight, with discernment as we pour our love out to those around us.
[time=2205] And so it is to be super abounding but always under control.
[time=2210] One of the great rivers of the world is the Nile River of Egypt.
[time=2215] The Nile River of Egypt in its mainstream is over 4,000 miles long.
[time=2220] Normally the Nile is not any kind of a raging river.
[time=2224] But every spring as the spring rains come, the Nile River begins to grow and to swell.
[time=2231] And it overflows its banks and as it is carried along by the tremendous spring rains,
[time=2237] the Nile River spills over its banks floods that great delta region, that great agricultural region
[time=2244] and gives it the nourishment through the sediment that it carries down from the lush fertile mountain ranges.
[time=2252] As that river overflows its boundaries, as it overflows into the Nile delta, it doesn't do so out of control because it is all within God's perfect plan.
[time=2263] All within God's perfect control that as the Nile River carries that rich wonderful soil in its water,
[time=2271] it overflows the banks that it deposits the needed dirt in the Nile River delta area.
[time=2276] So that agriculture can continue.
[time=2280] The farmers can grow their crops and it can continue to be one of the great agricultural regions of the world.
[time=2287] All that illustrates, I think so well, super abounding water but under God's control.
[time=2296] The Bible teaches that our love is to be just like that.
[time=2300] Abounding but under the control of the knowledge of God's word, using the insight and the judgment that we can get from a knowledge of that word and through the illumination of the Holy Spirit in our Christian life.
[time=2312] But let's bring that down to earth, let's bring that down to where we live.
[time=2317] Let's give a few examples of what we can do here in Fort Wayne in 1990 to use this love wisely.
[time=2325] I believe that it means that I am to pour out my love for my unsaved neighbor.
[time=2331] My love for my unsaved neighbor is to be abounding.
[time=2334] It is to abound in every respect.
[time=2336] I am to pour out my love to my unsaved neighbor to an attempt to reach him for Jesus Christ.
[time=2343] But as I do that, I am to do it within proper biblical standards.
[time=2348] I am not to compromise my Christian testimony or my Christian witness, but I am to pour out that love within the bounds of wisdom and knowledge and standards that are laid out in God's word.
[time=2362] The Bible teaches that I am to love my children and I want them to be happy.
[time=2366] I want my children to be happy and pleased with me.
[time=2369] I want to pour out my love to them and to have them have the joy of living in my home and being loved by me.
[time=2377] But I believe that this verse teaches that I am to pour out that love with godly knowledge and godly wisdom and it's not love out of control.
[time=2387] It's love that's controlled within the bounds at times of biblical discipline.
[time=2393] I reach out to them with a corrective hand and bring them back along the path to which they are to go.
[time=2400] Abounding love, but through the wisdom and knowledge of God's word.
[time=2405] I can love my brother in Christ aboundingly and I am to reach out to him.
[time=2410] I am to put my arms around him and I am to hug him and I love him unconditionally because he's my brother.
[time=2417] But the Bible teaches here, I believe, that that love that I pour out also at times will bring a gentle rebuke or may bring a gentle confrontation when I need to confront a brother or a sister in Christ.
[time=2432] I need to use it with proper love.
[time=2436] I love my church and my ministry here at Blackhawk.
[time=2440] It's my responsibility as a minister of the gospel to pour my love into this church and into its people.
[time=2446] It's my job as a minister to pour myself into the ministries of the church to support them, to pour out a love and a dynamic love in an action that gets things done.
[time=2457] It's important that I pour myself into it, but it's important that I pour myself in within the knowledge and the wisdom that the Bible can give me.
[time=2467] For it's important that as I pour myself in, I do not pull myself away from my family which needs me, that I do not neglect them and violate God's word by love out of control in one area of life, not properly spread among the areas where it needs to be.
[time=2486] Oh, those are just a few of the important areas I believe that show that our love is to be abounding, but within knowledge and wisdom.
[time=2495] The first thing that we are to have is excellence in love, excellence in love, but secondly this morning in verse 10, the second half of verse 10, the Bible teaches we are to have excellence in our daily walk.
[time=2507] Excellence in our daily walk, read the second half of verse 10 so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ.
[time=2520] Paul is saying to the Philippians that it is my prayer for you that you walk righteously every day, that you have an excellence in your daily walk, that you be pure and blameless until the day when Christ returns.
[time=2534] That means that we are to live our Christian life with an absence of hypocrisy.
[time=2540] We are not to live our Christian life with a hypocrisy that epitomizes our daily living.
[time=2546] Paul is saying that we are not to live with an outward sign of godliness, an outward sign of purity when deep down within is hidden sin, hidden flaws.
[time=2559] He says we're not to do that because that's hypocrisy.
[time=2562] Paul says that we are to be pure and we are to be blameless.
[time=2567] The first word there, he says, we are to be pure.
[time=2571] We are to be sincere, the King James Version says, and I like that there.
[time=2576] The Greek word actually means sun tested, tested by the sun.
[time=2581] There's an interesting story behind that.
[time=2584] In the times of Paul, fine pottery that was made was a very, very thin walled pottery.
[time=2591] Much like our fine china today was very, very carefully made.
[time=2596] And as a result of that, when the pottery was finished, it would be fired in a furnace and then it would be taken out.
[time=2603] And if there were any cracks or any imperfections in it, this proper, honest merchant would take that piece of pottery and throw it away and start over.
[time=2611] He wouldn't sell that piece of pottery.
[time=2614] But an unscrupulous merchant holding up that piece of pottery, seeing the cracks that were in it, seeing the hidden flaws,
[time=2622] would take some pearly colored wax, would fill in the cracks, and then he would market the pottery as perfect pure to the people in the marketplace.
[time=2634] Well, there was only one way of finding the cracks.
[time=2638] If a person wanted to purchase the pottery and make sure that it was pure, not only on the outside, but pure on the inside, he would have to take it and hold it up to the sun.
[time=2647] And as he held it up to the bright sunshine, the inner flaws and cracks would show through in the pottery, and he wouldn't be fooled.
[time=2655] And he would know that the merchant was not being totally honest with him.
[time=2659] That's the word that Paul uses here.
[time=2661] He says that we are to be sun tested.
[time=2663] Our lives are not only to be pure on the outside, but when held up to the sun, when held up to close examination, the flaws and the imperfections are not to be on the inside either.
[time=2676] He says to we are to be pure inside and out, inside, we are to be pure outside.
[time=2683] We are, of course, to be pure.
[time=2685] And so he says we are not just to show an exterior shell of purity and beauty in our lives, but also inside we are not to have ulterior motives.
[time=2698] We are not to have sinful desires, we are not to have conduct or thoughts or true agendas that are not what God would want us to have.
[time=2709] Our motives are not to be self-centered and selfish.
[time=2713] The inside is to be as pure as that that we show the world around us.
[time=2719] Many years ago I came home from work one day.
[time=2722] Linda had come home from work after a long day. It was her first day in the classroom several years ago.
[time=2729] And as I came home, it was late for both of us. There was no dinner ready.
[time=2733] And as I bounded in the door, she caught me at the door and said, "Wait. We are not having dinner home tonight. I am taking you out to dinner."
[time=2741] I thought, "Well, that sounds good. Where do we get the money? Don't worry about it. I got it covered."
[time=2747] Okay, let's go. Well, I didn't know where the money had come from, but as we got in the car and traveled to the restaurant, I was really glad to go.
[time=2755] You know, she just kind of looked up at me with this shining smile and innocence and said, "I just want to take you out to dinner.
[time=2762] I just want to show you a nice relaxing time after your hard day of work." Oh, it was great. We got to the restaurant and the waitress brought the menus.
[time=2770] And I'm still trying to figure out where the money is going to come from for this great meal that she's going to take me.
[time=2775] So I turned in the menu and I began to look at the, you know, the 4.95, 5-ounce cut steaks and things like that, the cheaper ones on the menu.
[time=2783] Linda said, "Hey, no problem. I've got it covered. It's all taken care of. Order whatever you want."
[time=2791] Well, I turned and ordered a large top sirloin. Oh, it was great. And then as we went through the meal, I couldn't help but think to myself, "What's going on?"
[time=2801] Well, the waitress came with the check and Linda said, "I'll take it. I'll take it. No problem. Put the check down and said, "Why don't we have dessert?"
[time=2808] I said, "Honey, those desserts are about 4.95, a piece for the cheesecake and all that." Do you think, "Don't worry about it. I got it covered. It's all taken care of. I just want you to have a good time." So we ordered. Well, we enjoyed our dessert and then the waitress came to collect the money and Linda said, "Oh, let's have another cup of coffee and relax.
[time=2825] Let's just enjoy being together." So we did. Finally, the waitress came to pick up the check. Linda reached in her purse and pulled out my Visa card and handed her the card.
[time=2838] And then added a little tip on top of that. I kind of felt like Ricky Ricardo when he got duped by Lucy, you know?
[time=2846] Oh, on that particular day. What I saw on the outside, that smile, that purity interface was not really what was going on inside her heart at that moment.
[time=2861] You know, we've joked about that many, many times and we've had a good time remembering that and again yesterday as we spoke about the message today.
[time=2870] But the fact of the matter is, it says our motives are to be pure. Our thoughts are to be pure. We are to have times when we examine what's going on inside of us.
[time=2881] Take a step back. Retire for a moment from the fight and look inside of ourselves and say, "What sins are there in my life that I need to take care of?
[time=2890] What is going on inside of me that I need to change?" And then we need to confess it to God and be willing to turn from that.
[time=2899] Yes, we need to be pure. It also says we need to be blameless. That means without offense. In other words, not causing another brother or sister to stumble.
[time=2911] What Paul is really saying there is, our outward acts, our outward behavior, our daily lives are not to lead others into sin by what they see us do.
[time=2924] Our daily lives are to be one of godliness and righteousness so that those who watch us, those who imitate us, our friends, our children and any others who may be watching us from afar are not led into sin by what they see in you and I.
[time=2942] We are to be pure. We are to be blameless. We are to have excellence in Christian living. Excellence in our daily walk. Yes, we need to examine ourselves at times.
[time=2955] Look for areas of hypocrisy and then be willing to deal with them before God and rid our lives of them. We need to have excellence in our daily walk.
[time=2966] And then thirdly, in verse 11, we will see that we need to have excellence in fruit bearing. Excellence in fruit bearing, verse 11, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and the praise of God.
[time=2985] The end result of a life of love and a blameless walk is our third point today and that is that we will have an excellent life that bears fruit for Jesus Christ.
[time=2998] Jesus said, "My disciples will be known by the fruit that they bear in their lives for me."
[time=3006] The Bible teaches that what at the time that we are born again, at the time that we believe, we stand righteous before God. In a judicious sense, we have been declared righteous before God. We have received eternal life.
[time=3020] It also teaches that at that time, the Holy Spirit comes upon us and begins to work a great transformation in our lives.
[time=3028] And as we go through our daily lives, it teaches that the Holy Spirit transforms us, changes us, and begins to make us godly and holy in our ways that we might bear fruit for our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3042] Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we begin to bear our fruit for Jesus Christ.
[time=3048] Now, what are these spiritual fruits that are to be manifested in our lives? Well, first of all, of course, there is the fruit of the Spirit.
[time=3055] There is the fruit that we have spoken about so many times. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[time=3067] All of those godly attributes are the fruit of one who walks for Christ and who allows his precious Holy Spirit to come in and transform his life.
[time=3077] But there are others. Another is the fruit of soul winning. That's one that's not thought of too often.
[time=3084] But Paul reminds us that there is to be fruit born in our life, and that is to be that of winning souls to him.
[time=3091] In Romans chapter 1 in verse 13, Paul writes this, "Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, and often I purpose to come to you, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
[time=3106] What Paul is saying there is that he had hoped that he could come to them, to proclaim to them the Word of God, to have souls won to Christ because of his witness that he might be bear fruit in his life by the leading of other souls to Christ.
[time=3123] All we all know that Paul was a great soul winner, and that he personally led and discipled so many to Jesus Christ throughout the years of his ministry.
[time=3131] But his word teaches today that we are also to have that great, great soul winning fruit born out in our life.
[time=3142] We are to have the fruit of soul winning. And then he says in Romans chapter 6, "We are to have the fruit of holiness."
[time=3150] In Romans chapter 6 verse 22, "We are to have the fruit of holiness in our lives. But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is everlasting life."
[time=3171] He says that there is to be a holiness, a sanctification. There is to be a godly walk in our lives.
[time=3179] And the Bible teaches that as we go about our life, living for him, walking for him every day, that that sanctifying process takes place, and it says that more and more we take upon us, the image of Christ in our daily life, that as we walk for him, we can become more and more godly.
[time=3198] Yes we stumble. Yes we fall. Yes we do sin. But we can get upon us a holy and godly perspective. We can be transformed into the likeness of Jesus Christ.
[time=3213] And then the Bible in Colossians talks about the fruit of good works. We are to do good works. And that is part of this fruit that we are to bear.
[time=3222] It also talks about a fruit of thanksgiving. We are to be thankful in our life. We are to go to Christ with thanksgiving, and that is one of those fruits which we will have in our life.
[time=3236] As Christians, we are to have an excellence in fruit bearing. We are to have a time when we come to Christ, when we are changed dramatically, and that it is to be a life of sanctification as we walk daily with him.
[time=3250] Several weeks ago, a man who I admire and respect very much came to town for a rally. His name was Charles Colson. Charles Colson, of course, is the president of prison fellowship.
[time=3261] And he came for a rally here in Fort Wayne and spoke and challenged our hearts to support his ministry, one that goes into the prisons of America and changes lives for Jesus Christ.
[time=3273] But after that rally and after a luncheon that Colson attended, I began to think back anew, back several years to when I had first become acquainted with Charles Colson.
[time=3283] And I went back and read a couple of his books through again. And a few of the thoughts I think that I had about him illustrate the change that comes over a life as we seek Christian excellence in the area of fruit bearing.
[time=3298] For there was a time when Chuck Colson was known as the White House Hatchet Man, the one who was in charge of dirty tricks in the White House, the one who was in charge of doing whatever it took to get the job done.
[time=3311] The Wall Street Journal said of him one time that he was willing to walk on his grandmother if that's what it took to get things done.
[time=3318] But then something happened to him. As he came face to face with Jesus Christ at the height of the Watergate scandal, it teaches that Charles Colson was transformed.
[time=3330] He had a time when he trusted Christ as Savior and at that moment he was declared righteous in his standing before God.
[time=3338] But more than that, in the 17 years since then, his life has changed and he has grown and the sanctifying process has worked upon his life.
[time=3348] Ruthlessness has changed to righteousness. Toughness has been replaced by tenderness.
[time=3356] Blind loyalty to a man has been replaced by blind loyalty and love to his God, to his Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=3365] The great ministry of prison fellowship has gone on and that life has become one of the fruit of the Spirit, a holy and godly life, one of good works.
[time=3377] The Bible teaches very simply that we are to have excellence in our Christian life, excellence in the way that we apply our love, excellence in the way that we walk on a daily basis so that hypocrisy is not a part of that life.
[time=3394] And lastly, as we go through that Christian life, it says that we are to bear fruit in our lives. Spiritual fruit, but not just the fruit of the Spirit, but that of winning souls, that of walking and godly and holy way, that of being righteous.
[time=3409] It would be my prayer this morning that we would heed the words of Paul and as we close this morning, I would just ask that we would all examine our lives and think about the things that we cherish in this life.
[time=3422] What is it that you're pursuing? What is it that you and I are trying to be excellent in?
[time=3428] I would pray that we are seeking excellence in our Christian life. Let's pray.
[time=3455] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our sanctuary choir in orchestra, soloists and the ensemble reflection. The message today was from our associate pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=3466] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3475] Dear Heavenly Father, I've come to the point in my life that I know that I need a Savior and I know that I've sinned against you.
[time=3484] And I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3495] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3499] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
