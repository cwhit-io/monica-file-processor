[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=61] (dramatic music) - Welcome to an hour of Bible Study,
[time=71] music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=74] Thank you for joining us.
[time=76] Today, Tim Teder, our Minister of Youth, will be bringing us a message he has entitled, Finders Weepers, Losers Keepers.
[time=83] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along as Tim shares with us.
[time=88] Our special music includes a selection from the handbell choir, an organ solo from Scott Schindler, and a vocal solo from Ed Richard.
[time=98] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a number entitled, "Thou Art Worthy." (upbeat music)
[time=120] ("Thou Art Worthy") [MUSIC - 201 seconds]
[time=329] - It's wonderful every once in a while,
[time=341] just to take a phrase and to think of the Lord as you're singing it and reflecting on the worthiness of our Lord and the honor, do His name.
[time=350] Let's sing together two hymns, 105 and 106.
[time=354] We're singing just the chorus of He is Lord, and we're going to praise Him, praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer.
[time=361] He is Lord together on the chorus.
[time=364] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=498] - Continue praising.
[time=499] We'll learn together as we listen to the handbell perform for us.
[time=515] (gentle piano music)
[time=695] - Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=698] Last week I was gone, I had the privilege of going to a music conference in California,
[time=710] and then spending five days with my folks in Northern California, and that was a great opportunity to see the Bible Hour, one week delayed, out there in California, and we are thankful for those of you that watch out that far away from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=728] That was a beautiful time of the year to be in California.
[time=731] God has certainly blessed your state, and it was just blooming with gorgeous flowers, and we had a wonderful relaxing time.
[time=738] But we're very glad to be back here at the Bible Hour and Black Hawk Baptist Church serving the Lord.
[time=743] I want to thank our Associate Pastors, Steve Long.
[time=746] and Tim Teder for assisting us last week on the Bible Hour.
[time=750] It's been a wonderful month.
[time=752] We appreciated Easter Sunday and the chance to celebrate the risen Lord with music and testimony from our Associate Pastors.
[time=759] We've had some great speakers, and I hope that you will continue to watch us and to join with us in our worship services here on the Bible Hour.
[time=767] As we look forward to May, our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson will be speaking, and on May 13th we'll have a guest speaker, Dr. Don Gehrig from Summit Christian College right here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=779] And then on May 20th we'll have Dr. David Burnham from Florida, and rounding out the month we'll have Associate Pastor Tim Teder speaking.
[time=787] It should be exciting Sundays, they'll be packed with music, and it'll be a great time of fellowship, so continue to watch the Bible Hour and join with us.
[time=796] And we are also glad when you respond and tell us that you've been watching, and that is a great encouragement to us, and we're grateful for that.
[time=805] If you have the opportunity and don't usually attend church on Sunday nights, let me tell you about a great event that's coming up in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=814] On May 6th, our children's choirs, the King's Kids, will be presenting a musical entitled The Greatest Show on Heaven and Earth. That's May 6th at 6 p.m. here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=827] These young people, they're in grades one, two, and three, have been preparing for several months, and it's a delightful time to see these young people present this musical.
[time=836] So if you don't normally attend church on Sunday nights, join us May 6th at 6 p.m.
[time=842] And then, as I mentioned, we'll have a special guest on May 13th, that's Mother's Day, and we'll have a special guest on Mother's Day, and we will especially honor our mothers on that morning.
[time=855] Dr. Donald Gehrig, the President of Summit Christian College here in Fort Wayne, will be speaking.
[time=860] That's a special time, and if you don't normally attend church, get someone, call up your friends or relatives, and ask them to bring you to the Black Hawk Baptist Church on Sunday, May 13th, and join us.
[time=873] We'd love to have you for that time.
[time=876] Throughout the past month, we've been offering a booklet entitled What the Bible Says About Jesus Christ.
[time=883] This is a great booklet, and we offer it to you today.
[time=886] It talks about answers concerning who Jesus really is.
[time=890] And this is our last opportunity to offer it to you, so I hope that you will write this week for What the Bible Says About Jesus Christ.
[time=898] You can receive this helpful booklet by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=910] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=920] Once again, it's a delight to just share with you events that are taking place in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church and to tell you again how thankful we are that you watched the Bible hour daily.
[time=931] And please write to us and let us know what God is doing in your life.
[time=935] We'd be delighted to hear from you.
[time=937] If you go back now to the live portion of our broadcast, I trust that God will bless you in a particular way this week.
[time=965] [MUSIC - 153 seconds]
[time=1129] Five days at a music conference, I listened to a lot of musicians perform and go through new music that we'll be presenting many of the pieces in our services here at Black Hawk.
[time=1140] But each time someone performed or some choir saying, I was deeply grateful that I'm a part of Black Hawk Baptist Church and thankful for our musicians, for Scott and for the choir and for the handbells rich and the other ensembles that we have and indeed grateful to have these people perform and serve in this way.
[time=1161] We're also grateful for our staff.
[time=1163] We thank Steve Longbrake for assisting last week in the service and Jim Pearson and Tim Teder and Dale Johnson and our deacons and elders that work to continue the ongoing of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1178] We are very grateful for these men and thank them.
[time=1181] Once in a while it doesn't pay to be gone because one of your associates will be able to get back at you, so it's better off that you stay home.
[time=1189] But if you have not seen a Jogathon and seen Steve Longbrake run around that track, you ought to be here Tuesday afternoon at Black Hawk Christian School having their annual Jogathon and watch that senior citizen soon to be running around that track.
[time=1209] The only thing is there will be a couple others that are a little older and running quite a ways behind him.
[time=1216] Let's bow in prayer please.
[time=1220] Father again we are just grateful for the fellowship that we have here and Lord we pray that we will not take it for granted.
[time=1228] We will realize that there are places all over the world and all over the United States that churches that are troubled
[time=1237] do not have the same fellowship that we experience Sunday after Sunday here at Black Hawk.
[time=1243] Lord we are thankful that we have these people that have joined together that look forward to coming to worship you.
[time=1250] We thank you for our staff that prepares messages and meets the needs of the people.
[time=1258] We thank you for Jim and Tim.
[time=1260] We pray that you will bless Tim as he preaches in just a few moments that God will honor what he has to say and that we will take it in and use it for our edification and glory.
[time=1270] And Lord as we gather here today we know that there are people that are hurting in our church.
[time=1275] We perhaps have financial situations and they do not know how they are going to get out of them and how they are going to handle tomorrow morning when Monday comes.
[time=1283] We pray that you will just give them a certain amount of peace today and some wisdom in the decisions that they need to make tomorrow that will help them.
[time=1291] And Lord there are people recovering from situations that we're not honoring to God but they've turned their lives back over to you.
[time=1299] And we are aware that that's an everyday difficult thing for some people.
[time=1304] And we pray that you will continue to give them strength to honor your name and keep their lives pure.
[time=1310] Lord there are families in our church today that are hurting because of deaths.
[time=1314] We pray for Marv Dagot's family.
[time=1317] Pray for his wife that you'll give her comfort today.
[time=1321] Pray for Jan Vantil and her family and Marilyn Knudsen and her family as they've lost a father.
[time=1328] And we do want to thank you for the great legacy that he left and the strength that he's given his family because of his love for the Lord and his faithful witness.
[time=1337] And may that be our challenge today as we continue to live as you will.
[time=1342] And we will be those people that will live and stand out for you.
[time=1347] And we pray for Brad Ball and his family as they sorrow over the loss of his mother.
[time=1352] And if there are others that we know not of that you will just give them strength in this day.
[time=1356] And that there will be strength and encouragement in our service today that will carry us through the week.
[time=1361] That will make us Christians not only on Sundays that are alive and well a lighthouse that will be a beacon that will shine in this dark world.
[time=1372] And Lord we heard from the handbells that you are a river of life and we thank you that that river flows and that you give a spiritual refreshment from your river.
[time=1381] And we pray that we'll draw on it today and that will prepare us for the week ahead and for the many conflicts that we'll experience.
[time=1389] And we pray as we continue this service that your name will be honored and glorified in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1418] [MUSIC - 227 seconds]
[time=1650] I'm so thankful to be part of a church that has known more for its fine facilities and its excellent programs, so thank God for that, but it's known as a congregation of people that love and care, and that was a good reminder that we need to maintain that priority.
[time=1672] You've heard the phrase "finders keepers, losers weepers."
[time=1678] I don't remember the first time I heard that or became aware of what it meant, but I know that during the course of my life, I've put that to good use.
[time=1688] I remember when I was in junior high and I attended a fair, and I was standing in the game, the arcade room, the fair, and I looked across, and I noticed something on the floor.
[time=1699] It was small, it was green, it was kind of dirty, and I wandered over to see what it was, and it was money.
[time=1707] And it wasn't just one dollar, it wasn't five, it wasn't even ten, it was a twenty dollar bill.
[time=1714] And I'll tell you, for this seventh grader, that seemed like enormous riches.
[time=1719] And I remember walking over and stepping on that twenty dollar bill
[time=1726] and standing, trying to look as unexcited as possible for about five minutes, making sure no one noticed, and then reaching down to tie a shoe that was already tied and getting that twenty and slipping in my pocket and quickly walking out of the game room because finders keepers loseers weepers.
[time=1743] And I remember being in high school at a summer Bible camp and meeting this girl that was there and being quite interested in her, and as I got to know her a little more, I found out she had a boyfriend back at home.
[time=1756] Back at home.
[time=1759] She was at camp with me, finders keepers loseers weepers, right?
[time=1766] And we are told, over and over in our society, that if we're going to make it in this world, we need to be finders.
[time=1775] In fact, we need to find as much as we can, and we're told that the most important thing that any of us can find is to find ourselves.
[time=1784] Find yourself.
[time=1786] If you're going to enjoy life, you've got to find yourself.
[time=1790] If you're going to accomplish anything in life, you need to first of all find yourself.
[time=1793] If you're ever going to be somebody, if you're ever going to realize your potential in this life, you need to find yourself.
[time=1801] But one voice speaks out against all the others.
[time=1805] It's the voice of Jesus.
[time=1807] And Jesus says that if you really want to count, if you really want to count,
[time=1814] you've got to lose yourself.
[time=1817] The finders aren't the keepers, the losers are.
[time=1821] If a Bible turned to Mark 8.
[time=1824] And this message this morning is not one of those "feel good" messages necessarily.
[time=1829] Jesus was not always a "feel good" teacher.
[time=1832] Jesus was a truth teacher.
[time=1834] And sometimes the truth made the people feel good.
[time=1837] Sometimes it comforted them.
[time=1839] Other times it made them angry, made them upset, made them discouraged, made them puzzled.
[time=1844] We consider the subject of self-denial.
[time=1847] That bothers us, bothers me.
[time=1850] Because I know how inadequate I am.
[time=1852] But it's the truth.
[time=1853] What does Jesus say?
[time=1854] In Mark 8, beginning in verse 34, it says, "Then Jesus called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said,
[time=1863] 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[time=1868] For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.'"
[time=1876] What good is it for a man to gain the whole world and yet forfeit his own soul?
[time=1882] Jesus said that if we're going to follow after him, we have to lose our life.
[time=1886] If we're going to be his disciples, then we have to deny ourselves.
[time=1890] What does that mean?
[time=1891] What does it mean to deny ourselves?
[time=1894] Well, it's important for us to consider the topic of self-denial because we have a problem.
[time=1899] We all have a problem and it's a problem of pride.
[time=1903] Pride is the complete opposite of self-denial.
[time=1906] Pride focuses attention to ourselves.
[time=1909] Self-denial focuses attention away from ourselves, but we all have this problem.
[time=1913] We all have this pride problem.
[time=1915] In fact, in many senses, pride is a very common problem that we all have.
[time=1922] From the time of Adam and Eve when they chose to follow their own selfish, self-motivated inclinations
[time=1930] and to eat of a fruit that got it forbidden, from that time on, we have all struggled with an attitude that says, "I love myself.
[time=1937] I want to do good things for myself.
[time=1939] I want to pay attention to myself.
[time=1941] I think a lot about myself." I consider myself probably more important than other people.
[time=1951] And we struggle with that.
[time=1952] And we don't want to admit there's anything wrong with that.
[time=1955] We react against the idea that somehow we've got to give that attitude up.
[time=1959] But it's our pride that keeps us from God, and we need to understand self-denial.
[time=1964] It's a common problem.
[time=1965] But in many ways, I think the problem of pride that many of us struggle with is a contemporary problem too, because being a Christian in our culture in the 1990s has its own uniqueness.
[time=1979] I think we live in a generation that places great emphasis on self-love.
[time=1987] We're told to love ourselves.
[time=1990] We're told that if you're going to live up to your human potential that you've got to give attention to yourself, you've got to find yourself, you've got to love yourself.
[time=1999] You can just go to a bookstore and look through the psychology or self-help section,
[time=2005] and you'll see a lot of books given to this subject, learning how to accept and love yourself.
[time=2011] You may find titles such as these, trusting ourselves, how to be your own best friend, honoring the self, total self-confidence, pulling your own strings, celebrate yourself, stand up, speak out, and talk back.
[time=2024] And you may not necessarily find these titles in a Christian bookstore, but you would find their counterparts.
[time=2029] In fact, the author of Stand Up, Speak Out, and Talk Back co-authored a religious book on the same subject entitled The Assertive Christian.
[time=2038] We see that it's important in our culture today to place great emphasis on ourselves.
[time=2043] Even in Christian literature, a lot of Vimpsis is being placed on self-acceptance and self-reliance and self-assertiveness.
[time=2050] And I can understand that a recent poll among youth workers reported that these workers felt that the number one problem students had to face had to deal with was poor self-image, having a bad self-image.
[time=2065] And it's important that we deal with that.
[time=2069] But sometimes I think we've been too quick to accept the wrong counsel that is so often given.
[time=2077] In our culture, self-denial confuses the Christian.
[time=2083] Philip Yancy once told about the discussion group he was part of, and they were discussing the topic of sacrifice.
[time=2090] And one girl in the group spoke up and she said, "The Bible says I'm supposed to give up myself, but I spend $60 an hour to pay a counselor who tells me that I crucially need to find myself." He tells me, "I let people walk all over me that I need to become more aggressive and not let others dominate me." So it's a confusing issue.
[time=2111] Let me give you one other example of this contemporary problem as it relates to the church.
[time=2115] Not too many years ago, a prominent Christian leader in America authored a book on the subject of self-esteem.
[time=2122] And the contents of this book were considered so important, so relevant that copies of this book were distributed free to religious leaders throughout the country, tens of thousands of copies.
[time=2133] I got three of them in the mail myself.
[time=2135] And it was interesting to read what was being taught about self-esteem.
[time=2140] And I had problems with it.
[time=2142] Let me just read a few quotes from this book.
[time=2144] First of all, the definition of what sin is.
[time=2147] Sin is any actor thought that robs myself or another human being of his or her self-esteem.
[time=2153] And what is hell? It's the loss of pride that naturally follows separation from God.
[time=2158] A person is in hell when he has lost his self-esteem.
[time=2162] Self-esteem then, or pride in being a human being, is the single greatest need facing the human race today.
[time=2168] And what is the central underlying theme of the Lord's prayer?
[time=2171] It is the priceless value of every person.
[time=2173] We must tell people everywhere that God wants all of us to feel good about ourselves.
[time=2179] Who we? That's not the gospel. That is not the gospel.
[time=2183] The gospel is not God wants you to feel good about yourselves.
[time=2187] The gospel tells me that I really don't have that much reason to feel good about myself.
[time=2193] The gospel tells me that I am really inadequate when it comes to things that are important, but the gospel tells me that that doesn't matter because God places great worth and importance on me
[time=2203] that God is a gracious and loving God and accepts me and sacrificed himself for me.
[time=2207] That's the gospel.
[time=2211] Well, because of the contemporary pressure to spend so much energy in finding myself and loving myself, I need to give attention to what Jesus said about denying myself.
[time=2222] Before we talk about what self-denial is, let me just quickly mention three things that self-denial is not.
[time=2227] Self-denial does not mean rejecting personal effort.
[time=2231] Sometimes we get the idea that denying myself means that I realize that I am totally inadequate to live the Christian life and so I just sit back. I let go and let God. I wait for him to work in my life.
[time=2241] So we find people sitting and waiting for God to perform some wonderful thing in their Christian lives.
[time=2248] The Bible doesn't tell me that our Christian life works that way.
[time=2251] The Bible tells me that Christian life is a life of effort and work.
[time=2254] The Bible tells me that I am supposed to work at avoiding every kind of evil, that I am supposed to make every effort to add to my faith goodness and to goodness, knowledge, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2263] It tells me that I am supposed to pursue righteousness and holiness.
[time=2267] You see, the Christian life is a joint venture between God and ourselves.
[time=2272] God does things that we cannot do. I could never live the Christian life by myself.
[time=2276] God by His grace and by His power enables me to be a Christian to live the Christian life, but then He expects me to do something with that.
[time=2284] He expects me to work. He expects me to be disciplined. He expects me to be obedient.
[time=2290] And that does take work. That's an improper idea of what self-denial is when we think it's just rejecting personal effort.
[time=2298] Also, self-denial does not mean rejecting personal worth.
[time=2302] Denying myself doesn't mean that I just think I'm just some nobody that's not worth anything.
[time=2308] I think we have to have a right concept of what it means to have worth and value.
[time=2314] We'll talk about that a little bit, but don't be one of those people that is always putting yourself down, always creating or sizing yourself, and somehow you think that's spiritual.
[time=2322] "Oh, such a worm am I." You know, God just hasn't given me any gifts, and I'm just a miserable reprobate.
[time=2331] Nothing good in me at all. We're just always condemning and putting it.
[time=2335] I don't think that's what God intends.
[time=2337] In fact, I think the person is constantly criticizing themselves and talking about how lowly they are and all the problems that they have probably has a problem with pride.
[time=2346] They're focusing their attention on themselves, their own inadequacies, what they think they deserve and they're not getting, and how weak, and they're always focusing attention on themselves and complaining about themselves. That's pride. It might be disguised as something different, but it's pride.
[time=2360] That's not self-denial.
[time=2362] Self-denial takes the focus off ourselves and puts on something else.
[time=2366] And thirdly, self-denial does not mean rejecting personal pleasure.
[time=2370] I mean, this view equates self-denial with the total loss of personal enjoyment.
[time=2374] You think that denying yourselves means you're resigned to living a life of misery.
[time=2378] In fact, denying yourself probably means you'll end up doing the thing, the very thing that you hate.
[time=2383] I mean, do you hate bugs? The self-denial means you're going to be out somewhere dodging big fuzzy spiders and some foreign jungle is a missionary somewhere because God's going to make you do that.
[time=2392] That's not self-denial.
[time=2394] What does it mean then? How do I deny myself?
[time=2398] Let me suggest five ways that I must work at denying myself.
[time=2402] First of all, I deny myself by focusing on a proper God concept instead of myself concept.
[time=2412] I deny myself by focusing on a proper God concept instead of having a good self concept.
[time=2418] See, it doesn't really help for me to discover who I am in myself.
[time=2422] It's infinitely more important for me to discover who God is.
[time=2428] Some people would tell us that we can't really know God until we know ourselves.
[time=2435] That we can't really love God until we learn to love ourselves.
[time=2438] See, it starts with ourselves first and then we can learn to do all these other things.
[time=2443] What does God say?
[time=2445] Let me read one example in Scripture, someone who suffered from a sense of inadequacy.
[time=2451] And how did God deal? You don't need to turn there.
[time=2453] You'll be familiar with the story. Just let me read it.
[time=2455] Now, Moses was tending the flock of Jethro and led the flock to the far side of the desert.
[time=2460] There, the angel of the Lord appeared to him and flames a fire from within a bush.
[time=2465] Moses, Moses, and Moses said, "Here I am."
[time=2471] And the Lord said, "Now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
[time=2478] So now go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people out of Egypt."
[time=2484] But Moses said to God, "O God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
[time=2493] I mean, what if they don't believe me?
[time=2496] Why should they listen to me?
[time=2499] And God said, "I see that you're suffering from a poor self-image, Moses.
[time=2504] Come into my office. Let's try to build up your self-esteem so that you can be successful in the work that I'm going to give you."
[time=2510] And God didn't do that.
[time=2514] Moses felt inadequate, like we all do at times.
[time=2518] But God's response was not a course on self-concept.
[time=2522] God's response was a quick course on what Moses' God concept should be.
[time=2528] God said to Moses, "I am who I am." So you say to the Israelites, "The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob has sent me to you."
[time=2539] God focuses the attention of Moses on God himself.
[time=2544] Some of you may be in an endless pursuit to find yourself, to accept yourself, to know yourself.
[time=2550] Let me tell you this.
[time=2552] Make it your first priority.
[time=2553] Make it your first priority to know God.
[time=2556] So that's the first step in self-denial, knowing God.
[time=2561] When we know God, we learn to depend on Him instead of ourselves.
[time=2565] When we know God, we learn to trust Him instead of trusting ourselves.
[time=2569] And when we really know God, we learn to focus our attention, to give attention to Him instead of giving attention to ourselves.
[time=2578] To deny ourselves, we must have the right understanding of who God is.
[time=2582] Secondly, I deny myself by admitting and letting go of my pride.
[time=2587] The pride is that subtle trick of the heart that convinces me that I'm doing and thinking the right thing, even when God says I'm not.
[time=2593] That's what pride does to me.
[time=2595] But when I start with the proper God concept, who He is and how I relate to Him, then I begin to see myself the way He sees me.
[time=2606] And I see my pride for what it is.
[time=2610] Something not to boast in, but something to deny.
[time=2613] In His book, Mirror Christianity, C.S. Lewis wrote, that pride is a spiritual cancer.
[time=2619] It eats the very possibility of love or contentment or even common sense.
[time=2623] Pride leads to every other vice.
[time=2625] It is the complete anti-God statement of the mind.
[time=2629] Pride is self-glory.
[time=2632] Pride causes us to want to draw attention to ourselves.
[time=2637] I'm that way. I like people to recognize me.
[time=2639] I like attention to come out my way.
[time=2642] We're like the little frog who went up to the two geese and asked if he could fly with the two geese if they'd take himself for the winner.
[time=2648] And the two geese kind of puzzled about that, what they were to do.
[time=2651] And they said it a little frog, "Well, I'm sorry, there's no way for us to fly yourself." But the frog, being the smart little frog that he was, came up with a plan.
[time=2658] And he hopped over and got a big stick and placed the stick between the beaks of the two geese.
[time=2663] And then he himself opened his own mouth and held on to the stick.
[time=2666] And the geese took off and flew into the air.
[time=2668] And oh, what a sight it was.
[time=2670] These two geese flying through the air with this in-between frog hanging.
[time=2674] And people looked up and they were amazed astounded.
[time=2677] And one person remarked, "How wonderful!" "Well, who would have been so wise to think of a way to travel such as that?" And the frog opened his mouth to respond proudly, "I did!"
[time=2690] And we respond the same way.
[time=2692] We want to be quick to accept the tension and the credit.
[time=2696] We got to keep our mouths shut.
[time=2698] But pride is the thing that seeks for that self-glory.
[time=2703] Pride is doing things my way.
[time=2705] And we listen to old blue ice singing, "I did it my way." And the chills run up and down our spine because we think, "Yes, yes, I can be that kind of man.
[time=2713] I can be that kind of woman.
[time=2714] I can pick myself up by my own bootstraps.
[time=2716] I can make it myself in this life." When you think about it, that is pride.
[time=2725] Pride is considering myself better than others.
[time=2728] Oh, and this attitude comes so easy to me to think that I'm better than other people.
[time=2733] A few years ago, I was given a car.
[time=2736] It's a two-door, new, old's 98.
[time=2741] It looks sporty.
[time=2743] It looked good.
[time=2745] And you know what?
[time=2746] I looked good during it.
[time=2748] Now, it didn't matter.
[time=2749] The car didn't belong to me.
[time=2750] I was just giving it to you for a year or so.
[time=2753] But that didn't matter because when I pulled up to the stoplight, I looked over and here's this guy in the 76th Nova, that poor sap over there.
[time=2761] You know, I look at him.
[time=2762] My mouth would kind of smirk up as if to say, "Boy, I know you wish you were as successful as I am."
[time=2769] And I would think I was pretty hot stuff.
[time=2772] Isn't that amazing how we can even let things affect how we feel we're better than other people?
[time=2779] So pride does.
[time=2782] When you begin to think that you're better than other people, then you'll find reasons to use people.
[time=2788] It won't bother you so much that you heard others to help yourself because after all, you think you deserve it.
[time=2793] It's pride.
[time=2795] Pride is expecting to have what I deserve.
[time=2798] Pride is demanding my rights and we live in a society that places a premium on the right of the individual.
[time=2805] And everything from equal rights to the freedom of choice communicates this message that each person deserves those things which will bring happiness and peace and prosperity
[time=2815] and the individual has the right to pursue them without hindrance.
[time=2819] My intent this morning is not to discuss the rightness or wrongness of the issues, but the attitude behind the issues many times seems to be my right.
[time=2828] I have an individual to write to these things, and if I have the right, then I am going to exercise the right.
[time=2835] And the question that we ask to determine the decisions of our life seems to be, "Well, do I have the right to do it?"
[time=2844] And less and less do we hear, "Is it the right thing for me to do?" Pride demands rights.
[time=2851] Pride makes me feel like I expect to have what I deserve.
[time=2856] Pride is the very root of sin.
[time=2859] And we have very, very big sin problem because of the pride that's naturally a part of me, that's a part of you.
[time=2866] If I'm ever going to follow Christ and I need to be willing to admit my pride and to give it up, I need to deny myself, to deny myself.
[time=2874] Third, I deny myself by seeking approval from God rather than approval from others.
[time=2880] I want people's attention.
[time=2883] I want people to notice me.
[time=2886] I want people to approve of me.
[time=2888] I want people to think I'm worth something.
[time=2891] In fact, perhaps my greatest fear is to think that I might be ridiculed or ignored or put down by others.
[time=2902] But you know, Scripture tells me that God's kingdom isn't built on human measures or standards.
[time=2907] And I need to realize if I'm going to be Jesus's disciple, then there will be many people who don't approve of me.
[time=2911] In fact, it was Paul who said that if I start trying to please men, then at that point, I'm no longer being a servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=2924] See, in order to be approved by God, I've got to give up my personal desires for fame and for recognition, for popularity and success.
[time=2932] Now, those things may come to me in my life.
[time=2934] They may not.
[time=2935] But they cannot be my passion.
[time=2937] They cannot be what I long for.
[time=2939] I long for God's approval.
[time=2942] I long to be obedient.
[time=2944] And obedience is not easy.
[time=2947] Obedience is not an easy thing.
[time=2950] When it is my priority to obey God, then that means at times that I will have to give up relationships.
[time=2956] That means that I may have to be less financially successful because in my business practice, I will no longer do some of the things that previously brought in income because it's not right before God's eyes.
[time=2968] That means if I'm going to be obedient, then I'm going to give up things that I like doing that are pleasurable for me, but God says are wrong.
[time=2976] Obedience isn't easy.
[time=2978] But if it is my priority to please God, first of all, before having desire to please other people, then I begin to be denying myself.
[time=2988] Fourth, I deny myself by considering others more important than myself.
[time=2992] Now this is a very basic teaching in Scripture.
[time=2998] Philippians 2, 3 says, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourself."
[time=3005] Romans 12, 10, "Honor one another above yourself." Someone came to Jesus and said, "What's the greatest command, Jesus?" And Jesus said, "The greatest command is to love God with all your heart, soul, and mind." And the second command is just like the first, like to it.
[time=3020] It is love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[time=3024] Now what I understand Jesus to be teaching in that verse is that Jesus is telling me how I am to give an outward expression of love, and He's telling me the standard by which that love is to be expressed.
[time=3035] I am to love my neighbor in the same way that I love myself.
[time=3040] The focus is on the outward expression of love, but somehow today we've twisted that all around.
[time=3045] And how many times have I read or heard it taught from that verse that what Jesus is teaching is that Jesus is saying that first of all you've got to learn to love yourself.
[time=3053] And then once you learn to love yourself, then you can begin loving other people.
[time=3058] Honestly, folks, when I look at the verse, I don't think Jesus is teaching that at all.
[time=3062] Jesus is assuming, and rightly so, that I already love myself.
[time=3067] I may not feel all mushy about myself, but I love myself, and I show it every day because I care for myself.
[time=3072] I give attention to myself. I talk about myself.
[time=3075] I do all these things for myself.
[time=3077] And what Jesus said is, hey, in the same way now you need to be caring for and giving attention to other people.
[time=3089] We need to consider other people more important than ourselves.
[time=3092] I appreciate one counselor's frankness in this regard.
[time=3095] He tells of a college student that came to him and he suffered with great feelings of inferiority.
[time=3103] And the student came back to the counselor over and over again suffering from the same thing.
[time=3107] They talked about the same things over and over, and nothing seemed to be happening.
[time=3110] And finally, out of frustration, the counselor said to the student, you know, I don't think your problem is one of poor concept at all.
[time=3117] I think you're actually quite proud.
[time=3120] And the reason you feel inadequate and wretched is because you are, just like all of us are.
[time=3126] Forget yourself, accept yourself as who you are, and get on with your life.
[time=3131] Forget yourself and begin giving time to serving other people instead.
[time=3135] And you know, I think that may be good advice.
[time=3138] Too many times our feelings of inadequacy come because we focus so much of attention on ourself, and we need to deny ourself and begin serving others and loving others and giving attention to that.
[time=3149] We won't have time for sitting around in depression and misery.
[time=3156] Jesus calls us to serve others.
[time=3157] Finally, I deny myself by being willing and ready to suffer for Christ's sake.
[time=3162] You won't necessarily be required to suffer greatly because you're a Christian, but you might.
[time=3167] You won't necessarily suffer physical pain because of your faith, but you might.
[time=3173] You won't necessarily face personal persecution because of your trust in God, but you might.
[time=3179] And denying yourself means you're willing to do that.
[time=3183] Denying yourself means you're willing to give up even your physical and emotional safety in order to follow Jesus Christ.
[time=3190] And that's what Jesus meant when he said, "Take up your cross and follow me.
[time=3195] Be willing to suffer." What results when I deny myself?
[time=3202] When I deny myself by focusing on a proper God concept instead of a self-concept, this is when I learn true value.
[time=3211] This is when I discover how valuable I really am.
[time=3215] This is the real source of self-acceptance.
[time=3218] See, I can accept myself because God who made me and God who knows more about me than anybody else chooses to accept me.
[time=3228] And if he can do that, I can do that.
[time=3231] Now we need to be careful we don't twist this around.
[time=3233] I can never come to God and think, "You know God, I'm just a valuable person." I have intrinsic value that demands that you accept me.
[time=3242] That's not what the Bible teaches.
[time=3244] The Bible teaches that because God accepts me, even though I don't deserve it, that gives me great worth and great value.
[time=3254] And it does. That gives us great assuredness.
[time=3258] If I suffer from a bad self-concept, I won't help myself by concentrating more on myself.
[time=3263] I need to concentrate on my relationship with God.
[time=3266] And if he accepts me, then that settles it. That settles the matter.
[time=3270] And if I refuse to accept what God has already accepted, then I'm ignoring his grace.
[time=3275] And I think I believe that sin.
[time=3278] Someone might ask, "Well, how would you help somebody that suffers from a bad self-concept who isn't a Christian?" As you said, our self-acceptance comes from the fact that God accepts us and the value he places on us through Jesus Christ and his sacrifice.
[time=3292] What about someone who doesn't trust in Jesus Christ?
[time=3294] I'll just warn you.
[time=3296] Don't send anybody who is not a Christian to me to be counseled to build up their self-esteem.
[time=3301] I'm a lousy counselor when it comes to things like that.
[time=3303] I'll tell you why.
[time=3305] Because if a person comes in and they're without Christ and they have a feeling of inadequacy and they have a feeling of need
[time=3315] and they have a feeling of low self-esteem, I think maybe they're right where they ought to be.
[time=3321] Because without Christ, we are hopeless.
[time=3325] And if we were to try to build out the self-assuredness and the confidence and the security and individual without Christ, then it's a false confidence and it's a false security.
[time=3334] The Bible tells me that I first of all have to come before God and I humble myself before him.
[time=3339] And when I do that, what happens?
[time=3341] Humble yourself before God and God lifts you up.
[time=3345] Now that's not to say that a person that's not a Christian has nothing of value in their life.
[time=3349] I'm not saying that.
[time=3351] But when it comes to my real worth that comes through Jesus Christ.
[time=3357] It comes through Jesus Christ.
[time=3359] So when I deny myself, I find value. When I deny myself by letting go of my pride, I find freedom.
[time=3364] I'm not bound by pride.
[time=3366] That makes me bound to sin. That leads me into pursuing the things that I never can have.
[time=3371] And I never get the satisfaction. Ultimately I'm seeking for.
[time=3374] But when I let go of my pride, when God gives me the ability to recognize my sin and my pride and to let go of that, that I am free.
[time=3381] And I no longer have to sin.
[time=3383] And I no longer have to be compelled to do the things that my own desires and lust drive me to do.
[time=3388] I'm free from that.
[time=3389] And if Jesus Christ sets me free, then I'm free indeed.
[time=3394] When I deny myself by seeking God's approval rather than men's, I find peace.
[time=3399] Doesn't competition drive you nuts?
[time=3402] Doesn't the need to be better or accepted by other people bring tension in your life?
[time=3408] It does mine.
[time=3409] I'm always worried that I'm going to say or perform the right way.
[time=3411] I'm always concerned that I'm going to do or say something that other people will look at and gasp and think, "Oh, that was improper." And the need to compete and to be better and to perform well.
[time=3422] You know, if our first desire is to please God most of all, that releases us from that tension.
[time=3428] And we have a peace that comes with wanting to please God.
[time=3433] I want to please Christ and not seek the approval of other people.
[time=3437] And if that is my goal, and if that is my one objective to please God in all that I do, and be faithful in doing that, then I don't have to worry about the consequences.
[time=3447] I know that God accepts me and loves me the way that I am.
[time=3469] We've been sharing with you music from our sanctuary choir, the handbell choir, Scott Schindler at the piano and soloist, Ed Richard.
[time=3477] The message today was from our associate pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=3481] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray a prayer with you.
[time=3489] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3491] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for Jesus Christ.
[time=3496] And I thank you for sending your Son to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3501] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3504] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my Savior today.
[time=3510] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3514] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3518] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
