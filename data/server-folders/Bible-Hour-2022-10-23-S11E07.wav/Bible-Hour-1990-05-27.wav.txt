[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - What we leave is that the work is all done before anybody thinks about it.
[time=65] I have the privilege of a godly heritage, but really it's now that I have begun to reflect back on it and the input of that heritage was all done years ago.
[time=77] That reminds me that we today are living the sort of lives that is going to leave the heritage somebody will look back on someday.
[time=85] The question now is, what is the heritage we are leaving?
[time=90] (dramatic music) - Welcome to an hour of Bible study,
[time=101] music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=104] Thank you for joining us.
[time=106] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. Donald Gary, president of Summit Christian College.
[time=112] We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study along with us.
[time=116] Our special music today includes solos from Susan Toyrak, Kevin Rowe, and a song from the Men's Singers Quartet.
[time=125] We now join our worship service as the Men's Choir brings us a song entitled, "Great is Thy Faithfulness." (gentle music)
[time=140] [MUSIC - 171 seconds]
[time=323] (audience applauds) - Special thanks to our men.
[time=334] We appreciate their faithfulness at our church and their willingness to come yesterday at a wonderful breakfast men and then a good time of rehearsal and we appreciate our men so much.
[time=344] Him number 256, continue giving thanks to God and we'll sing verses one and three of 200, I'm sorry, five hundred fifty six.

[time=356] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=458] - Thank you very much for your singing.
[time=459] We continue in music now.
[time=461] The scripture says that the Lord Jesus said, "Upon this rock I will build my church, "and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Susan Toyratt comes now to minister to us in song.
[time=472] And let us open our hearts to the message that she has.
[time=475] (piano music)
[time=494] [MUSIC - 278 seconds]
[time=776] (audience applauds)
[time=786] - Thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=791] At the time of this recording, it's Mother's Day at Black Hawk Baptist Church, and we wanna wish all of you mothers a very happy Mother's Day.
[time=799] This tradition began about 1907 when a lady named Anna Jarvis decided that she was not going to forget her mother and encouraged her family and friends to wear flowers on Mother's Day as a remembrance.
[time=811] So we're really glad that we have this observation today and that we can tell you that we love you, and especially my own mother as she watches.
[time=818] I am grateful for the heritage that I had in a Christian home that led me to Jesus Christ.
[time=825] And we're glad that you're all tuned in and I trust that this will be a very special day for you.
[time=830] If you're watching in the Fort Wayne area, you still have time to come to Black Hawk this morning.
[time=835] Our services are at 9.15 and 10.50, and we have a very special guest.
[time=839] His name is Dr. David Burnham.
[time=842] Dr. Burnham was formerly the pastor in Ohio.
[time=845] When our former pastor Rick Hawks lived there and was saved under his ministry.
[time=850] We're delighted to have Dr. Burnham back with us.
[time=852] And then on May 20th at 6 p.m., we have the commencement exercises for the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=860] If you're in the area and you'd like to join with us, you'll hear a tremendous message in the morning and that a great observation of kids who have culminated 12 years of schooling right here at Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=871] We invite you to come and join with us.
[time=874] Last week I talked to you about the letters that we received and we really appreciate it when you write in and tell us that you've listened to the Bible hour and that you've had some response.
[time=884] And we're grateful for the encouragement that gives.
[time=887] This week, if you're a member of the Founders Club, I sent you a letter, just a letter of encouragement talking about the fact that we are glad, again, that you support us and that we have special needs here at the Bible hour and we ask you to continue supporting us in a financial way.
[time=903] We're very grateful for that.
[time=905] Today we have a special guest who's from right here in our own city, Dr. Don Gary.
[time=911] Good morning, Don.
[time=911] - Good morning, Pete.
[time=913] - And Don is the president of Summit Christian College right here in Fort Wayne and we recognize Summit Christian College in some ways by WBCL radio station.
[time=923] Don, I know a lot of our listeners and viewers watch that or listen to that station.
[time=927] - Yes, and we're happy they do.
[time=929] We have a very loyal and large listening audience around the Northeast part of Indiana.
[time=934] - And Don, you have a tremendous format there on the program.
[time=938] Sharp Binkley does a wonderful job and all of that.
[time=942] Carlson, I lost his name for him, Jeff Carlson, that's right.
[time=948] He attends our church and is an inspiration to a lot of people on the morning hour when we're just a little grumpy.
[time=954] He gets us into the swing of things.
[time=956] - He's very much one of a kind, yes.
[time=958] - Well Don, we're grateful that there's a school such as Summit Christian College right in our city.
[time=963] Can you tell us a little bit about some of the advantages we have in having a school such as this in our town?
[time=970] - Well Summit is a school which specializes in training people for ministry and service.
[time=975] We've done this now for almost 100 years.
[time=978] We'll be celebrating our centennial in 1995.
[time=980] So we're already starting to think about that.
[time=983] I think one of the things that we find especially helpful to our students and to the community is the fact that we emphasize practical service as well as classroom experience.
[time=995] So all of our students are required to do service in the area this past year.
[time=1000] They served in over 90 different churches and social service agencies.
[time=1005] We did a little computation one day and found out that they're donating something like 30,000 hours of volunteer labor a year in just in the Fort Wayne area.
[time=1014] - Well that's great Don, and let me ask you this.
[time=1017] Sometimes this is a question that comes up in the minds of even our own people.
[time=1022] Summit Christian College is a Christian college as the name connotes.
[time=1025] Does that mean that it's just a Bible college or how do you explain that?
[time=1030] - Well we are a Bible college in the sense that every student carries a double major in addition to whatever professional major they choose.
[time=1038] They also get a major in Bible.
[time=1040] And we think that's a very important integration of truth.
[time=1043] All truth is God's truth after all.
[time=1045] - Well I think that's wonderful and we thank you for being here today.
[time=1048] And in a few moments we look forward to your message and you were talking about those people that are in the various churches and we're very grateful.
[time=1055] A lot of our viewers know of Scott Schindler, our organist and he came that way.
[time=1060] He started as an intern and just worked a few hours a week and now he's full time at the church and we're just delighted with Scott, a graduate of Summit Christian College and he's a wonderful example of some of the graduates that have come from Summit Christian School.
[time=1074] We're grateful for that.
[time=1075] Thank you very much. - Thank you Pete.
[time=1077] - As I said, we'll be looking forward to Dr. Gehrig's message in just a few moments.
[time=1082] Throughout this last month, Jim Pearson, one of our associate pastors, has been presenting a series in the evening in our services entitled Confronting Casual Christianity.
[time=1092] This booklet is a series of four messages that have been presented here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and are available to you now.
[time=1100] If you'll just write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1110] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1118] Thank you again for joining us here on The Bible Hour and we go back to our live portion of the service now as we listen to Kevin Rowe minister to us in song.
[time=1127] (upbeat music)
[time=1136] [MUSIC - 172 seconds]
[time=1314] (soft music) - As I listened to Kevin, the first service I was reminded
[time=1323] of Jim's series confronting casual Christianity and the fact that so many times we expect God to be a cheerleader to get us all excited about what's going on and that's the way we respond, but we forget too that we have the Holy Spirit that is quietly prodding us and encouraging us and reminding us that we need to serve the Lord.
[time=1342] I appreciate that message and song.
[time=1344] And we mentioned at the beginning of the hour that this is Mother's Day and we're certainly glad that you mothers are here.
[time=1350] I'm gonna take a moment and this was exciting in the first service to see all the great grandmothers that were in our service.
[time=1356] If you're a great grandmother, would you stand right now, please?
[time=1361] A great grandmother, look at that, that's great.
[time=1364] (audience applauds) That's wonderful.
[time=1371] Grandmothers, would you stand at this time, please?
[time=1374] Grandmothers.
[time=1376] Ah.
[time=1377] (audience applauds) And mothers, would you stand now, mothers?
[time=1384] That's great.
[time=1387] (audience applauds) Thank you very much.
[time=1392] There's a gift for you in the foyer.
[time=1395] Back in about 1907, there was a lady named Anna Jarvis that was determined that she was gonna give on to her mother and insisted that her family do the same.
[time=1404] That began in Philadelphia and by 1910, that was a national holiday and we're certainly grateful for it and realize that you are very important in our lives and also very grateful for your ministry and families and at Blackhawk, the number of children that have been taught by our mothers in the Sunday schools has just been great.
[time=1426] Now some of you, while they were standing, got a little bit complacent, so you need to stand just for a moment and greet those around you and tell them you're glad that they're here.
[time=1434] Will you do that, please?
[time=1435] Very quickly, right now.
[time=1437] (gentle music)
[time=1463] [MUSIC - 160 seconds]
[time=1631] (audience applauds) [AMEN]
[time=1640] We had a good time with Dr. Don Gary, as we did the insert this morning, and we were talking about WBCL and all the very well-known personalities that are on that program, and I said Char Binkley and got that really well, and then I was going for Jeff Carlson, and I said that Carlson guy.
[time=1660] I really couldn't think of Jeff's name, I can't imagine how I would forget that, but we do appreciate the ministry of WBCL in our community and also Summit Christian College, and we are grateful for the fact that Dr. Gary, the president of the college, is a neighbor of Black Hawk, and has attended here occasionally, and we're grateful for that, and we're also grateful that he has the opportunity to speak to us today.
[time=1684] So I'd like to have you give a Black Hawk welcome to Dr. Donald Gary, the president of Summit Christian College.
[time=1690] (audience applauds) I had heard the quartet in the first service,
[time=1703] so I knew what was coming, and I don't know which was better, listening to the quartet or watching Jeff.
[time=1708] He enjoys quartet music, we have found that out, and was doing well.
[time=1713] The other observation I've made this morning is, grandmothers are getting younger.
[time=1718] (audience laughs) I don't know what that says.
[time=1726] Okay, I understand last Sunday, you had a bird in the sanctuary, and I'm glad that was last Sunday.
[time=1734] I was speaking in a little church south of Fort Wayne some months ago, and before I was to speak, a young lady was singing a solo, and a bat got loose in that church, and that gave new definition to distraction.
[time=1749] (audience laughs) It was interesting, you could watch the flight pattern of the bat by just watching the heads in the congregation.
[time=1756] (audience laughs) What was terribly disconcerting, though, was that I had to get up and preach, they were going right on with the service, I was introduced, had no idea how I was gonna try to keep everybody's attention under those circumstances, but when I got up to preach, this is the honest truth, as soon as I started to preach, the bat went over to one of the windows, attached itself to the leaded part of the stained glass window, and went to sleep.
[time=1783] (audience laughs) That's exactly how my son responded,
[time=1793] (audience laughs) as he reminded me that I'd been doing that for years.
[time=1797] (audience laughs) Well, I'm glad we're not bothered here today.
[time=1803] Some months ago, we were having an administrator's meeting at the college, and one of them, who was in charge of the devotional time that morning, started with the most fascinating question.
[time=1814] It was this, what would you like to have written on your tombstone? (laughs) I have to admit that none of us had given just a great deal of thought to that before, but it did make a great conversation starter, I wanna tell you, as we tried to think about what we'd like to have remembered about us that would be short enough to put on a tombstone.
[time=1837] Kinda took my mind back to the first pastorate that we held out in central Illinois.
[time=1843] It was one of those little white frame country churches, picture book, the sort of thing that literally artists came to paint, and of course behind it was the typical cemetery.
[time=1857] And my wife and I used to enjoy going out sometimes just walking through and reading the inscriptions.
[time=1864] My, that cemetery dated back about 125 years.
[time=1867] It was like following the history of the community, as you went through it.
[time=1871] I guess it also said something about our entertainment budget in those days, but we did enjoy doing that, and it told us a lot about people, but what would you like to have on yours?
[time=1885] You know, that gets it a lot more personal.
[time=1888] The trick of this of course is that the legacy we leave is something we can't decide on when we get to the end.
[time=1897] When it comes time to do the inscription, it's too late to do anything about it.
[time=1903] Whatever has gone into a life to bring us to that point is already over with.
[time=1909] We are right now living whatever will turn out to be our legacy someday.
[time=1919] So we have to think about it now, or it will be too late.
[time=1923] I doubt seriously that the Apostle Paul had a tombstone.
[time=1927] I, the circumstances of his death, at least as much as we know about it through history, would not have suggested that.
[time=1935] But if he had, I would guess that the words for it would have come out of his final words in 2 Timothy the 4th chapter.
[time=1946] This book which scholars generally agree was probably the last book he wrote, at least the last one that we have recorded in scripture, brought to a conclusion a great, great life.
[time=1958] And beginning with verse six, he talks about that in just a brief moment of reflection.
[time=1963] He says, "I am already being poured out "like a drink offering, and the time has come "for my departure.
[time=1971] "I have fought the good fight.
[time=1974] "I have finished the race.
[time=1976] "I have kept the faith.
[time=1978] "Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, "which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me "on that day, and not only to me, but also to all "who have longed for his appearing." My guess is that if there were a tombstone for the Apostle Paul, the inscription would be that seventh verse.
[time=2001] "I have fought the good fight.
[time=2003] "I have finished the race.
[time=2005] "I have kept the faith." I want to suggest to you very simply this morning that that little verse gives us three goals toward which we should be moving in our lives.
[time=2017] That that verse itself is a goal that might be good for us to think about as we think about our legacy, the heritage we are leaving.
[time=2026] I'm thankful to God on this special day that I can point to a heritage of godliness.
[time=2034] My mother, who's now with the Lord, was one who always exemplified Christ, who helped to train us as a family.
[time=2042] As a result, I think partially of that, all four of the children in our family, my siblings, all of us, are involved in ministry today.
[time=2050] My dad, who's 90 and still living, to this day exemplifies Christ.
[time=2055] I enjoy that heritage.
[time=2059] But I am now in the process of leaving a heritage.
[time=2063] And these are goals toward which I want to work.
[time=2065] The first phrase in that verse suggests this goal to me, that we should choose our purpose wisely.
[time=2073] Paul says, "I have fought the good fight." That statement is not really a victory statement as it looks on the first blush.
[time=2084] It's not somebody standing in the corner of the ring saying, "I fought a good fight." Rather, the emphasis is on the word good.
[time=2094] And it's really a statement about the quality of the priority, the quality of the priorities that Paul lived with.
[time=2101] I have fought, he says, "The good fight." Out of all of the choices I had, I picked the best.
[time=2109] I fought the good fight.
[time=2111] And that's the clue I'd like to share with you in this first goal.
[time=2117] You see, all of us have something for which we live.
[time=2120] Many of us do that quite intentionally, some quite frankly, by default.
[time=2126] Maybe the best way to help identify that would be to ask the question this way.
[time=2132] What is it that would make you say, "Aha, that's it.
[time=2137] "I did it." I don't know.
[time=2143] For some people, that turns into a level of income.
[time=2147] I'm gonna be a millionaire by such and such a day.
[time=2150] Aha, I made it.
[time=2151] For some, it's a job, a position.
[time=2156] By such and such a time, I wanna move up to be a vice president of whatever.
[time=2160] Aha, I made it.
[time=2161] I've known people for whom you could have inserted a trip.
[time=2167] That really became the center of a life.
[time=2168] I'm gonna get a trip to Europe.
[time=2171] I'm gonna work for that.
[time=2172] Aha, I finally made it.
[time=2173] I have enough collected to go.
[time=2176] I don't know.
[time=2177] I don't know what it is that you insert there, but Paul's suggestion would be that we ought to be careful that whatever that purpose is, that goal, we wanna make sure it's worthy, that when it's all over, it will be worthwhile.
[time=2193] Will it be something worth remembering?
[time=2197] For him, he could say he had fought the good fight.
[time=2201] He had made wise choices in how he invested his life.
[time=2206] He talked about that one other time in writing to the Philippian Christians.
[time=2213] Great couple of verses in the first chapter of Philippians.
[time=2217] Verses nine and 10, it's a sequence where he keeps adding on to the issue.
[time=2225] This is my prayer, he said, that your love may abound more and more.
[time=2231] That's a pretty worthy goal, but not real well-defined, is it?
[time=2236] What does that mean?
[time=2238] That your love may abound more and more, and I've heard people preach on themes like that, and it's about as far as they get, and I always feel good and it's sort of squishy, but when it's all over with, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do about it.
[time=2251] I like nailing jello to a wall.
[time=2254] Well, Paul doesn't do.
[time=2255] He doesn't leave us there, he leads us on.
[time=2258] Says that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight.
[time=2263] Oh, no, we're getting somewhere.
[time=2266] If I really love God, I will want to know more about God.
[time=2273] So love for God is not just a nice feeling, it's not just experiential, it's something that involves the discipline of coming to know more and more about him.
[time=2289] But even that is not the end.
[time=2290] He says that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight.
[time=2295] So that purpose, you may be able to discern what is best.
[time=2300] See, we're coming to this choice idea again.
[time=2305] Most of the choices as Christians that we make that really make a difference aren't really between good and bad, but between better and best.
[time=2318] And Paul says, I want your love for God to lead you to know more about God so that you'll make the best choices to reflect that love for God.
[time=2329] And he adds one more line to it after that, that you may discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ.
[time=2337] Well, there it starts to fit together, you see.
[time=2340] And Paul had done that.
[time=2341] His life was consumed with the desire to serve God, to see the gospel spread.
[time=2347] In his case, it was very direct involvement.
[time=2350] For others, it may be more indirect, but it doesn't change the purpose.
[time=2356] One of the realities I'm discovering
[time=2362] about being a college president is that fundraising is high on the agenda.
[time=2367] I've told people I feel like I've become a professional beggar.
[time=2370] But in that process, I've met some very wonderful people.
[time=2377] And there's one gentleman I think of this morning.
[time=2379] And I use him as an example, because if I use a minister or a missionary, some of you are gonna say, well, that doesn't apply to me.
[time=2388] I wanna show you that God's purposes can be in the center of every life.
[time=2393] This gentleman has a real gift for making money.
[time=2398] Incredible.
[time=2399] I mean, everything he's touched in his life has turned good.
[time=2408] But what I've discovered as I've gotten to know him is that he's used that for a purpose.
[time=2415] That making the money was not his first purpose.
[time=2420] His first purpose was to bless the work of God.
[time=2424] Now, never forget the first time he gave me a check
[time=2430] for Summit Christian College, because he did it with tears in his eyes, and before you laugh, it wasn't tears that he had to let go of it.
[time=2438] But these were genuine tears of joy, because this was what his life was about.
[time=2445] You see, he was using the gifts that God had given him
[time=2451] for the purpose that was central to him, and that was to see the work of God go forward.
[time=2457] And he gave it with joy.
[time=2459] That's what I'm talking about.
[time=2461] Investing our lives in something that matters for eternity.
[time=2467] Choose your purpose wisely.
[time=2470] For the purpose you're choosing today will make a difference, whether someday somebody could say, "You fought the good fight." Now, the second phrase, I have finished the race.
[time=2486] I don't know about you, but I, for some reason, the first image that pops in my mind with that phrase is the old story about the tortoise and the hare.
[time=2497] The rabbit goes shooting off in the race and gets so far ahead, decides he can stop and rest, and the turtle just keeps plotting along, and finally ends up winning.
[time=2506] Now, that's not in the Bible, but it sure contains a good illustration of truth in the Bible that I think is reflected here.
[time=2515] I've finished the race.
[time=2517] Some of us get so excited about beginnings that we forget that the real test is the ending.
[time=2524] In the parable of the sower, the issue wasn't as much the seed sown as it was the fruit produced.
[time=2531] That's where the test came.
[time=2532] In the book of Revelation, over and over, early in those messages to the churches, the key is he who overcomes, you know, getting to the finish line.
[time=2543] There's a consistency of life that is suggested
[time=2549] in that little phrase, "I finished the race," that we ought not to miss.
[time=2553] As a pastor, I found that sometimes people
[time=2560] would come into the church with great excitement, and boy, they'd jump in with both feet.
[time=2565] What can we do?
[time=2566] This is a great place.
[time=2567] I love it.
[time=2568] Give me a job.
[time=2569] I want to be involved.
[time=2570] And then a year later, what I discovered to is
[time=2577] they were down the street at the next church, saying, "Well, this is a great place.
[time=2580] Give me a job.
[time=2581] What can I do?
[time=2581] I want to be involved." And that wasn't how we built a church.
[time=2588] In fact, I was invited back just a few weeks ago to that church where I had pastored up in Chicago.
[time=2594] They were celebrating their 75th anniversary, and they asked me to come back and preach.
[time=2598] And for some reason it hit me that day, more than it ever had in the 10 years that I had pastored there.
[time=2606] But as I looked around the congregation, I realized that there were certain families that I could pick out that had been the backbone of making that church great.
[time=2615] And the key was they had stuck it out.
[time=2618] They were consistent.
[time=2619] They were faithful.
[time=2621] I could call off the names.
[time=2623] My guess is the same thing could happen here.
[time=2627] That there would be families.
[time=2628] People could say the reason Blackhawk Baptist Church is what it is today is partially because that family and that family and that family have faithfully stuck by it all these years.
[time=2640] Consistency.
[time=2641] You know, we honor being busy today.
[time=2646] If you don't believe that, find out what you do when the boss shows up.
[time=2652] I mean, even if you have nothing to do, you try to look busy then.
[time=2657] Because it's important to be busy.
[time=2659] That's success.
[time=2661] The real question is busy doing what?
[time=2666] So the second goal that we're talking about here is that we invest our energy efficiently.
[time=2674] Choose our purpose wisely, but also invest our energy efficiently.
[time=2680] We need to make sure that the energy of our lives is directed toward our purpose.
[time=2685] What happens is there is one part of us, the inside part of us that knows what it wants to do,
[time=2696] but there's that outside part of us that's doing and we need to make sure they match.
[time=2701] Sometimes our day timers don't match our purposes.
[time=2706] I want to be a good mother.
[time=2712] I want to be a good husband.
[time=2714] I want to be a good wife, but I open up the daytime and I don't see any place where I did it.
[time=2718] I don't see any time that I took.
[time=2720] In fact, days like today can sometimes be bad because what we do is try to pour everything into today to honor our mothers that we ought to be doing all the time.
[time=2731] And we do that with the Lord sometimes.
[time=2737] We pour into moments what really ought to be happening all the time.
[time=2742] I think a lot of the frustration that Christians face today is that conflict between the reality of their day-by-day existence as it matches up to their purposes.
[time=2754] And when those don't agree, when we know inside, we ought to be doing one thing but we see on the outside we're actually doing something else we get into conflict.
[time=2762] Investing our energy for the purpose that really matters
[time=2769] and then keeping at it.
[time=2772] I don't think it's accidental that probably the prevailing picture in scripture about our relationship with God is the picture of walking with God.
[time=2784] Are there a few times when you have other images?
[time=2787] Hebrews 12, running the race.
[time=2789] But most of the time, the picture is that we walk with God
[time=2796] and I suspect that's fairly intentional, consistent day-by-day.
[time=2801] Paul could say that.
[time=2809] Paul had a way of not letting up and it was wonderful.
[time=2813] He kept pushing and pushing and pushing so that there came a point where he could honestly say, "I have finished the race." Well, there's two-thirds of the goal setting this morning.
[time=2825] Choose your purpose wisely, invest your energy efficiently.
[time=2829] There's one more to go.
[time=2831] "I have kept the faith," Paul says.
[time=2834] And that suggests to me the goal of following the truth carefully.
[time=2841] Truth is interesting.
[time=2844] I don't know of anybody.
[time=2846] Now, that isn't to say that they might not exist somewhere, but in my acquaintance, at least, I don't know of anybody who rejected the truth all in one big step.
[time=2859] Just woke up one day and said, "I'm gonna be a heretic." Boom.
[time=2865] I look at schools.
[time=2867] You see, I'm involved in that now and I see around the country today, college after college, universities, that I know in their history started off to honor God, to train people for service for God.
[time=2881] This was the core of what they were about and today.
[time=2884] Why?
[time=2885] There isn't anything that even resembles that kind of purpose left.
[time=2888] Now, that didn't happen because one day somebody walked onto that campus and said, "Let's leave the truth." No.
[time=2898] What happens is truth is sacrificed in bits and pieces.
[time=2904] A little here, a little there, until it finally collects into heresy.
[time=2912] What I'm suggesting this morning on the positive side of that picture is the truth is also secured in bits and pieces.
[time=2922] It never stops being our goal.
[time=2926] The best way to follow the truth carefully, the best way to keep the faith is to make sure that we continue to be eager students of the truth.
[time=2938] As I mentioned earlier, my dad is still living.
[time=2943] He's 90, he's blind, but other than that, sharp as a tack, God's really blessed him with great health and quick mind.
[time=2953] All of my life, I have remembered Dad and Mom reading the Bible through.
[time=2959] That's been their goal every year.
[time=2961] I just, that just goes on like clockwork, as far back as I can think, Dad and Mom read the Bible through every year.
[time=2968] When Dad lost his eyesight, we went and bought him scripture tapes so he could keep up his practice.
[time=2977] And I remember one time visiting with him, it was about three or four months after we had gotten those tapes for him.
[time=2985] And I happened to say, how do they work?
[time=2988] How do you like the tapes?
[time=2989] He says, "Oh, they're great, I'm already through them once." He's 90, he's never quit.
[time=2998] He always wants to know more.
[time=3001] That has to be what drives us if we're gonna be faithful to the truth over the long haul.
[time=3009] You never quit.
[time=3013] Paul could honestly say that had been what he committed his life to for a whole lifetime.
[time=3020] And my, how he exemplified that in his life, as he shared the truth, proclaimed the truth all over his world.
[time=3027] As a church, I think that has to be something we keep pointing toward.
[time=3032] Churches don't leave the faith in big jumps, but by bits and pieces.
[time=3037] Churches aren't known for their commitment to the truth unless they keep pushing, keep growing.
[time=3045] I get a little frightened today.
[time=3047] I now have the opportunity to travel in churches.
[time=3050] I'm preaching different places every week.
[time=3053] And you know, sometimes I sort of agree with one description I heard.
[time=3059] Fellows said that the truth of the church today is a mile long and an inch deep.
[time=3064] And I'm afraid there's a little too much truth to that.
[time=3068] That kind of scares me.
[time=3069] We're sort of surface Christians.
[time=3072] We're satisfied with just kind of feeling good about it.
[time=3076] One of the things that blesses my heart about this church is that it's known for its commitment to the Word.
[time=3082] And that has to be the case.
[time=3085] Stay strong.
[time=3087] Well, 75 years from now when other people are celebrating the anniversaries of this church, I hope they can look back to today and understand that this church stood firm for the truth.
[time=3101] Well, what a goal, there it is.
[time=3104] Choose your purpose wisely.
[time=3106] Invest your energy efficiently.
[time=3109] Follow the truth carefully.
[time=3111] Those, my friends, are life goals.
[time=3114] Those are goals that have to consume us now.
[time=3118] If someday we'd like to have put on our tombstone, I fought a good fight.
[time=3126] I finished the race.
[time=3128] I kept the faith.
[time=3129] When I moved to our church in the Chicago area of Park, Illinois, one of the first ladies I met was the name of Ruth.
[time=3140] I met her because she was at the church a lot.
[time=3143] She was the teacher of the five-year-olds.
[time=3147] I suppose a lot of people would think that's kind of a throwaway job, you know?
[time=3151] And other people like me would say it's the worst job in the church to have to work with five-year-olds, but that's 'cause I don't know anything about working with kids, she loved them.
[time=3162] And she was at the church almost always at the church a couple of times a week working in her room.
[time=3170] I want to tell you that five-year-old room was something to behold.
[time=3174] It was great, an exciting learning center 'cause Ruth kept it that way.
[time=3183] Remember, the first time I visited in their home, it was sort of like sitting in the middle of a supply center.
[time=3188] Wasn't completely neat, but Ruth was the kind
[time=3194] who saved anything that might work with five-year-olds.
[time=3198] So everything from pictures out of magazines to milk cartons to whatever else was around the place.
[time=3204] She always had her supplies.
[time=3210] Few years after we were there, Ruth discovered she had a malignant brain tumor.
[time=3215] And from the point of the discovery of that, it really didn't take too long until she had gone home to be with the Lord.
[time=3222] Then the dog huntest thing happened.
[time=3226] I've never seen anything quite like it because at the wake and the next day at the funeral for Ruth, people came back from all over the place.
[time=3238] I didn't see anything like this.
[time=3240] Missionaries home on furlough who heard about Ruth's death made a point to get back for her funeral.
[time=3247] College kids took off school to come back for Ruth's funeral.
[time=3253] And what I began to discover that I hadn't really known
[time=3259] before was that Ruth never let go of any of those five-year-olds.
[time=3266] She invested her life in those people.
[time=3270] And I had missionaries telling me, oh, Ruth was the one who was our favorite prayer lawyer.
[time=3277] She kept writing letters and encouraging us.
[time=3280] College students would say, boy, we had to stay close to God in our walk because we knew Ruth was gonna ask us when we came back home.
[time=3290] She'd keep in touch.
[time=3292] And here was a lady who at the end of her life had the tribute of all of these other lives who had been influenced by her.
[time=3303] Now, you know, Ruth wouldn't win many awards today
[time=3310] in terms of human success.
[time=3313] She wouldn't push Donald Trump off the cover of Ford's magazine.
[time=3318] And a lot of people never did or will
[time=3325] know of her, but I submit to you today that if I'd have had the chance, I could have easily put on her tombstone.
[time=3336] I fought the good fight.
[time=3338] I finished the race.
[time=3341] I kept the faith.
[time=3345] I don't know about you, mom's dad's.
[time=3355] But I somehow hope that somewhere in the 21st century, if the Lord terries and somebody walks through a graveyard
[time=3367] down the line someday, and they come across the name of Don Gary on one of those stones, I really would hope that without any hesitation,
[time=3380] they could think back, even if it is, doesn't happen to be actually written there.
[time=3385] They could think back and honestly say, there was a fellow who fought the good fight, who finished the race and who kept the faith.
[time=3393] If you don't know Christ today, today is the day to start preparing that legacy.
[time=3402] If you do, but you're not walking close to Him, today is the day to get back in line and begin to write that chapter of your life.
[time=3413] If you are following Him today is the day to renew that commitment, choose your purpose wisely, invest your energy efficiently, follow the truth carefully.
[time=3424] That's the way to glorify Him.

[time=3483] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3490] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3498] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3501] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3506] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3509] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
