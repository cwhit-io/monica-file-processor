[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - Every one of us at some point in our lives comes to a crossroads.
[time=66] It's a place where you have to make decisions.
[time=68] A decision about your job.
[time=70] A decision about relationships.
[time=72] Where are you going?
[time=74] Jeremy?
[time=75] Oh, my gosh.
[time=76] It's a place where you have to make decisions.
[time=83] A decision about your job.
[time=84] A decision about relationships.
[time=86] Where are you going?
[time=88] Jeremiah talked about a crossroads for a nation, but he also talked about a crossroads for the individual.
[time=94] We'll examine that in a time when we make decisions about our life.

[time=606] (soft music)

[time=724] (soft music)
[time=730] Do you want to follow Jesus if it goes against the flow before you hold and follow him? There's really something you should know before you go?
[time=747] Is Jesus more than heaven? He's more than heaven. Held in your head. A real disciple. A real disciple that is the plan.
[time=764] Where your treasure is laid, that is the plan. Where your heart will be found too. Where your treasure is laid, that is the plan.
[time=789] (singing in foreign language)
[time=826] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour Today. We've had a number of special services and special days at Blackhawk Baptist Church and this day is no exception.
[time=835] Today we are honoring all of our graduates from high schools and colleges and universities in our area. It's a great number of young people and we're looking forward to seeing great things from them as they go on in their education and they go out into the world and further prepare for the ministries that they might have.
[time=853] So we're glad that you've joined in today and we're also thankful as I've said many times about your letters and having them come into us and reading that you are watching and that you have needs.
[time=864] And we have shared those needs with our staff and have prayed faithfully for you. One letter came in this week and asked if the Bible Hour was going to continue.
[time=873] Let me assure you that our staff is in place and we have a search committee that is looking right now for our new pastor and we are just trusting the Lord that that time will come when we'll have a new senior pastor.
[time=885] But right now our staff is in place and we continue to want to minister through the Bible Hour and we hope that you'll stay with us.
[time=892] Our special guest today is David Burnham. Good morning, David. Peter, it's good to see you. We're glad to have you back. David was the speaker at our dedication of our new building just about a year and a half ago.
[time=905] And David is the pastor teacher of the Day of Discovery Television broadcast from the Radio Bible class. David, you travel a great deal.
[time=914] Tell us about some of the events that you've been involved in in recent days. Peter, it's a joy to be back here at Blackhawk.
[time=921] And we've been traveling. So my wife and I have been traveling a great deal together and sometimes I go alone.
[time=926] But we had the ministry with the International Sports Coalition where at the Olympics we brought together teams and ministries and chaplains to serve in an outreach at the Olympic time in Seoul, Korea.
[time=939] And that was a great experience. And then since that time I've been working with Dave Discovery and Radio Bible class and they're good people.
[time=946] But Peter, it's really good to be here today. You talked about graduation. I remember when a young man graduated from high school in Akron and his name was Rick Hawks.
[time=956] And I remember how God had his hand upon his life. David, Rick is a very exciting young man. I think he was very energetic in those days having been involved in camp ministries and really was under your ministry for a number of years and had a profound effect on his ministry now.
[time=972] Not only as a pastor, but as he seeks a new career in the coming months. And we're grateful for your ministry to Rick Hawks. That was really wonderful.
[time=981] Well, ministry is a good word and it includes sometimes different areas of life than what we always define as ministry. But God uses them as ministry for his glory.
[time=990] Rick's one of those unusual guys that comes along. He was a leader even as a young man.
[time=995] Well, that's great. Thank you for saying those good words about him. In just a few moments, David Burnham will be speaking to us in our morning service. If you're in the area, he will also be speaking tonight at 6 p.m. in our service.
[time=1007] And we want you to come and join with us. We've been talking about a booklet that's been available the last month here during the month of May that's entitled Confronting Casual Christianity.
[time=1019] This has been a series of messages from our associate pastor Jim Pearson and they're available in booklet form and we'd like to send you this booklet if you'll just write to us today.
[time=1029] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1048] We hope that you will write it for this booklet. It'll help you in just really identifying your dedication to the ministry and to the work of the Lord.
[time=1057] It's very easy to get caught up in events that take place among the family and in your work and we just don't take the time to really get alone with the Lord Jesus Christ and ask him to guide us and strengthen us.
[time=1069] So I hope that you will write for that booklet today. We're going back to our live service now. We hope that you'll stay with us.
[time=1075] Let's join the service now as we hear the string quartet play for us.
[time=1105] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=1165] Our Heavenly Father, we bow before you right now, thanking you for the privilege of just simply meeting together in this sanctuary, a place of refuge, a place where we can put away our cares of the day and just centralize our thoughts on you.
[time=1185] May we continue to worship you, and may we be in awe of what you've done for us.
[time=1191] May we be thankful, Lord, that you've given us a place in heaven. You've promised that you've gone there to prepare a place for us, and we're grateful for that.
[time=1199] But as we get to know you, may we go beyond that and not only be grateful for eternal life, but for the fellowship that we can begin to experience right here among Christians and because of your Holy Spirit.
[time=1210] We're also thankful, Lord, that you intercede when we have difficulties every new day brings different circumstances for people in our church.
[time=1221] Lord, there have been deaths among our church members this week. We pray that you'll continue to comfort the hackleys and the loss of Pam Hackley's mother.
[time=1230] We pray that you'll give that extra comfort in peace. As we anticipate the funeral of Mr. Lots tomorrow, we pray that you will just continue to uphold Mrs. Lots.
[time=1242] Thank you for the fact that they know you as Savior, that Mr. Lots is in heaven and that Mrs. Lots can rejoice because of that.
[time=1250] And Lord, there are people in our congregation that have experienced operations in the last week, some of whom have already come home, and we're grateful for that.
[time=1259] Thank you for your healing power and the wisdom that you've given the doctors to correct situations that were malfunctioning.
[time=1268] We plead with you to protect and to heal and to continue to give strength in bodies that have been repaired in recent days.
[time=1278] And now we pray as we continue to worship you that you'll open our hearts to the message that God has for us.
[time=1284] We pray that we might rejoice in you that we indeed know you as Savior and can meet this way in this house of the Lord.
[time=1290] Bless us as we continue to worship in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1314] A great day is coming, Heaven's gates will open wide, and all who love the Lord will enter in.
[time=1334] And join with their loved ones who in Jesus Christ have died. Our eternal life in Heaven will begin.
[time=1351] And the Lord Himself will greet us, O a joy will feel that day. And with a smile of the proudest Father, He looks at us to say.
[time=1373] Welcome home children, this is the place I've prepared for you. Welcome home children, now that your work on Earth is new.
[time=1402] Welcome home children, you have follows of faithfully. Welcome home children, welcome home children, you where I am.
[time=1431] You will always be forever rejoicing with me.
[time=1462] Welcome home children, this is the place I've prepared for you. Welcome home children, welcome home children.
[time=1485] You where I am, you will always be forever rejoicing forever rejoicing forever rejoicing with me.
[time=1514] Welcome home children, welcome home children, welcome home children.
[time=1534] This morning it's possible that you've already seen our speaker. If you watch television this morning and having to watch Day of Discovery, Dr. David Burnham was speaking to us from Israel.
[time=1545] First my wife was a little worried that that was live and that something was amiss here in the church.
[time=1552] I am grateful for the ministry that he has there. And as you recall, when we dedicated our building here a year ago last October, Dr. Burnham came, and at that time he was busy working with a coalition
[time=1563] to reach athletes at the Olympics to make sure they heard the gospel of Jesus Christ. I know that was a successful venture, but more than that we are indebted to him because of his ministry prior to leaving Akron.
[time=1578] Remember Rick Hawks has mentioned his name several times because David Burnham was pastor at the church Rick attended, and I remember these words. He said at camp, he met a man that was a man's man and a God's man.
[time=1595] That impressed him so that he came to know Christ, and then he was shepherded by Dr. Burnham and wise enough to follow the leading and the type that Dr. Burnham set for him there in Akron.
[time=1608] And we have the privilege of being the beneficiary of that. So we're grateful for what you do, but more than that we're grateful for what you've done. Thank you very much for coming. Dr. David Burnham.
[time=1625] It is a joy for my wife and for me to be here this morning, and to have songs that tell us that there is a spirit of worship. O come, let us adore him, Jesus Christ the Lord.
[time=1648] The ministry of music is able to reach into our hearts. It reached mine this morning. And then to hear the declaration that we are welcome home. We are welcome into a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. That's a great privilege.
[time=1664] And I'm thankful this morning to come to Blackhawk and to be a part of a fellowship that would desire to worship the Lord Jesus Christ and to provide a church home, a place where we can serve the Lord with the abilities and gifts that God has given to us.
[time=1681] It's a joy to see Rick and Kathy. And I am thankful for the heritage of this church from the time with Dr. Jeremiah and the foundation of preaching the Word of God with authority.
[time=1695] For the ministry of Pastor Hawks, as he faithfully taught the Word of God, and even as I stand at this pulpit this morning, not only to build a pulpit, but to build a foundation of honoring the Word of God.
[time=1708] And the ministry that God would give us is truly a high calling. That ministry includes music. The ministry includes proclamation. The ministry includes the outreach to athletes at the Olympics.
[time=1723] The ministry includes the privilege of the printed page through radio Bible class and Day of Discovery. God uses many forms of ministry. And God is able to use our lives in ways we never dreamed.
[time=1738] And I am confident of the high calling of God upon Rick's life. And for your prayers and for my prayers as this ministry that God opens in serving in government would be fulfilled to honor him with that which would please God by being faithful.
[time=1757] We live in an interesting world and the times in which you and I would use our gifts and our abilities to serve him, our ministries provide us this day with one of the great periods and mankind.
[time=1770] I say that because we live in a world of change. Change brings opportunity. This morning in an area of the world there are elections being held for the first time.
[time=1782] There are portions of the world that at Easter time for the first time in a generation were able to declare publicly. He is risen. He is risen indeed.
[time=1793] For a generation they had only done that in private in secret. And from their long tradition they long to declare it publicly. We have lived in a time of change where they could actually do that publicly.
[time=1808] Change is a part of our world. But in the midst of change whether it be in governments, in our economics, in our own community, whether it be the changes that are taking place in your life.
[time=1820] My wife and I now have grandchildren. That's quite a change. I even get to change diapers. I had never made that change. It seemed like in a long time. It's a wonderful change.
[time=1831] But in the changes that occur in our life, in our government, those changes should not affect us in our relationship with God. But I'd like to ask you a question today.
[time=1845] Do you share with God how you honestly feel? Do you tell Him what you like and what you dislike?
[time=1858] We were visiting in England with our son and had the privilege of just spending a few days there and learning a great deal about England that we as Americans sometimes forget.
[time=1871] One of the things that came back to my mind very vividly was that the English drive on the wrong side of the road. I don't know if you have been to England or not, but they drive on the wrong side of the road.
[time=1881] Now you would think as old as history they are, they would learn the right side to drive on, but they don't. When you sit in the driver's seat, you sit on the right-hand side. It's very awkward.
[time=1891] And when we arrived in England, we decided to rent a car. That was not a good decision. Because the car that we had had to also shift. Do you know how to shift and drive on the wrong side of the road?
[time=1905] It's shifting with a different hand, driving on the wrong side, and you have to look the opposite way than what you normally look when you come to an intersection.
[time=1914] And you know when you're walking or even driving, you just automatically do what you have done for all your lifetime and you basically look to the right and they're coming from the left.
[time=1925] There are dead Americans all over England as a result of looking the wrong way. But as we were driving and I'm trying to work out this shift, we came to a thing that they call a roundabout.
[time=1939] Do you know what a roundabout is? A roundabout is an intersection without lights. And you come to this intersection, there may be one, two, three, four other roads there.
[time=1952] And for you to get to your destination, you might want the first road to the right, well then you stop. You pull out into the traffic in the far lane and get off at the first intersection to the right.
[time=1962] If you want to go all the way around the intersection to across from where you're entering it, you get into the middle lane and then work your way back out and go back on your way at that second intersection.
[time=1974] If you want to come three quarters of the way around, you've got to get to the inside of the roundabout and then work your way back out.
[time=1983] Now, I had heard this, but when you get to that roundabout and there's a car behind you honking, you're shifting with the wrong hand, you start to pull out and your wife says, you're looking the wrong way.
[time=1995] And you look back and see a semi there and another one and just a little space in between them and you ram that gear in to the first and you move out into that intersection, it is quite an experience.
[time=2008] I got out there and I had to go three quarters of the way around so I got to the inside and now I know why they call it a roundabout because on the inside I couldn't get out and I went round and around and around the roundabout.
[time=2024] I don't know if you've ever been on a roundabout or not, but in each of our lives when we have to make decisions, even when we come to church, we're used to hearing someone talking about deciding for God.
[time=2037] You're used to that intersection and so you don't pay much attention to it.
[time=2044] But if you come to an intersection you're not familiar with like a roundabout and you're shifting with your left hand and you're not used to that, then you become very conscious of what you do and where you look and how you drive.
[time=2057] Friends this morning I'd like for you to come to a roundabout, a crossroads that is not just a common crossroads, it's not just a decision that you make today as to what you're going to eat.
[time=2070] But there are decisions you make about relationships, decisions about your job, decisions about how you think that are found in this text.
[time=2080] Will you turn in your Bibles to the Old Testament, to Jeremiah the sixth chapter?
[time=2085] And here is a prophet that did not drive in England, but he did speak to the children of Israel about decisions and a crossroads.
[time=2095] And he wanted them to stop, to look, to listen and to act properly.
[time=2103] Jeremiah chapter 6 verse 16, this is what the Lord says, stand at the crossroads.
[time=2113] Look, ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.
[time=2129] Stand at the crossroads, when you come to this ancient roundabout, a place where you have to make a decision, stand at the crossroads.
[time=2142] Look, be realistic about where you are, ask for the ancient paths.
[time=2150] This simple verse that speaks about a decision and a direction of life actually has a context to it.
[time=2159] There are conditions that surround this decision, and in a moment we'll look and examine some of the conditions that caused him to make this statement.
[time=2168] Jeremiah was a tremendous prophet of God, they call him the weeping prophet, but Jeremiah wept because he saw that people did not follow God, they made bad decisions.
[time=2181] But I like to study Jeremiah because Jeremiah also was the realistic prophet.
[time=2188] Jeremiah told God exactly how he felt. He told him his frustrations.
[time=2194] He told him about the things that he didn't understand, why God would permit someone to prosper that was not a good person that lied, and why seemingly those that were innocent didn't receive any help.
[time=2207] Jeremiah had trouble putting the pieces together. I don't know if you ever have that difficulty or not.
[time=2214] Even with God, do you understand how God is working in your family right now? Is it really clear how God is working in your job situation?
[time=2224] Jeremiah expressed reality. He did it right here.
[time=2230] And he gives to us a series of conditions, the context of the times.
[time=2236] And then with a strong and I believe positive statement, he gave a challenge. He wasn't trying to be negative, he wasn't trying to be pious, he gave a challenge to them, and then he said you must make a choice.
[time=2252] From this verse, we'll examine that condition. We'll see the challenge that he gave and then the responsibility of a choice. Stand at the crossroads and look.
[time=2266] When you come to those roundabouts, those times of decisions, when you're making a decision that is maybe even awkward, what are the conditions that you find yourself in?
[time=2277] If you go back to the 13th verse of this same chapter, you find Jeremiah giving these words of introduction.
[time=2284] He said that from the least to the greatest, everyone in our community is greedy for gain.
[time=2292] From the least to the greatest, all are greedy for gain. Greed is something that characterized their community.
[time=2302] A man recently can stand on Wall Street and later declare greed is good. Is greed good on Wall Street if you can get away with it?
[time=2313] Is it something that we can declare in a movie that greed is good? I mean grab all you can grab. Not new.
[time=2323] It says in the day of Jeremiah, from the least to the greatest, they had one thought in mind, greed.
[time=2332] They were grabbers, manipulators. It goes further.
[time=2337] Prophets and priests alike all practice deceit.
[time=2342] You can't trust anyone. Even the religious leaders practice deceit.
[time=2348] And Jeremiah says everybody is in it for themselves and even our religious leaders are deceitful.
[time=2355] In the 7th chapter we find out some of the things that they were doing.
[time=2359] He says there was no justice between man and man. Their dealings were not right.
[time=2365] Their greed, their deceit, even in their litigation, their dealings with one another. There was no justice.
[time=2372] He said there was no compassion. They didn't care about the homeless. They didn't really care about the poor.
[time=2378] There were greed. And there were elements of deceit that were far more important than those that were homeless and in need of their compassion.
[time=2388] There were those that needed protection, not only the widows, but even those innocents. They were shedding the blood of the innocents.
[time=2395] That's all in chapter 7. No justice, no compassion. They had no protection for the innocent and the weak.
[time=2406] And it said they also worshiped other idols. They followed after other gods.
[time=2413] They created a group of slogans. We discover here in the 6th chapter that it says in verse 7,
[time=2419] "They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious." And they say peace. Peace. When there is no peace.
[time=2429] Oh, they have a wonderful slogan. It sounds like the harmonic age in which they wanted them to live. Peace, peace.
[time=2436] Do you want health and wealth and success? They dress the wounds of the people, but they don't get to the core of the problem.
[time=2444] They have religious vocabulary. They want everything to sound like it's good, but underneath there's something that's wrong.
[time=2453] Over in the 7th chapter, turn there, if you will. You notice something about this. For it says in verse 4,
[time=2459] "Do not trust in deceptive words and say, 'This is the temple of the Lord.'" The temple of the Lord. The temple of the Lord.
[time=2468] They were using slogans. Peace, peace. The temple of the Lord. They wanted to act like they had religion. They had quite a heritage.
[time=2478] You see, Jeremiah, when he would write these words, had watched the people that had seen reform come to their land.
[time=2486] There'd been a time that had been great disobedience and a forgetting of God, but then a young man by the name of Josiah came to the throne.
[time=2494] And Josiah was a godly king. And government and people are always benefited when there are those that honor God.
[time=2503] When they honor the principles of God, great is that nation that honors the Lord. Josiah honored God.
[time=2511] They started cleaning up the temple. They restored it. And they restored the beauty of the temple.
[time=2517] While they were restoring it, they discovered that there was a scroll of the Torah from the Book of Deuteronomy.
[time=2524] And they again brought the scroll of Deuteronomy to read it. And the people said, "The law of God is good."
[time=2531] And they read, "The Lord our God is one God, the great Shema. I shall love the Lord thy God with all your heart, your soul, your mind."
[time=2542] We have the law. We have the temple. The temple, the temple. They had slogans.
[time=2551] But Jeremiah said, "You have greed, and your words are deceptive." Notice what it said in verse 8.
[time=2560] But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless. Will you steal and murder?
[time=2569] Commit adultery and perjury. Will you lie? Burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known.
[time=2579] And then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my name and say, "We are safe."
[time=2587] We are safe to do all these detestable things as this house, which bears my name, become a den of robbers to you.
[time=2597] But I have been watching, declares the Lord God.
[time=2601] You use slogans. You even come to the temple. But your lives have not changed.
[time=2609] You say, "We're safe." And there are many people who have had a religious heritage.
[time=2615] There are those that follow religious practices. They even go to church and say the church, the church, the book, the book.
[time=2624] Christian nation, Christian nation, but our daily lives have no integrity. There's greed. There's deceit.
[time=2634] There's the breaking of the commandment of God. We lie. We steal. We commit immorality. Are we safe?
[time=2643] And Jeremiah says, "These are the conditions that I find." As we stop at the crossroads of where we are as a nation, where are we going?
[time=2655] Israel has a tremendous heritage. We've had restoration. We've had rulers that told us about God.
[time=2662] We've had the law of God to teach us. We even know the vocabulary. But how do we live?
[time=2670] This church has had a great heritage.
[time=2675] This church knows how to sing the songs of the faith.
[time=2679] You know the sound doctrines of the Word of God, the law, the church.
[time=2686] But what about your daily life? What about the conduct at your business, in your school?
[time=2693] Your relationship with one another. Does it honor God? Does it please God?
[time=2700] Jeremiah said, "Stand at the crossroads and look."
[time=2707] Ask for the ancient paths. He gives them a challenge. Ask for the ancient paths and ask where the good way is.
[time=2716] Ask. Are you willing to humble yourself and seek an answer? Ask. That's what it really amounts to.
[time=2725] This is really quite difficult for most men to do.
[time=2729] When I was in England and trying to drive with that wrong side of the road, behavior and shifting roundabouts, I would get lost.
[time=2739] And I discovered the English don't like to give you directions.
[time=2743] Somehow they feel the country's been there long enough. You should know where it is historically.
[time=2748] And so you'd ask directions and for me to even stop and do that was a big step.
[time=2754] And I think our wives know this. Men don't like to let the wheels stop turning.
[time=2759] There's something that happens to us when we get behind the wheel and our foot is on the gas, we don't stop and ask anybody.
[time=2766] My wife would say, "Why don't you check at this service station? Just keep those wheels moving, baby. That's what you want to do."
[time=2773] I don't know if we don't want to admit that we don't know where we're going or we don't want to humble ourselves, but I got so lost I would ask.
[time=2781] And they would say, "The second light to the right." They didn't tell me that the second light was seven miles down the road.
[time=2788] But the English always in their directions this way. You can't miss it. You can't miss it.
[time=2796] I miss it every time.
[time=2799] And friends, sometimes when we do our ministries and our proclamation of the Word of God and we say, "Stop at the crossroads.
[time=2807] Here are the conditions. Ask for the ancient paths. You can't miss it. What is it?
[time=2814] What is the ancient path? What are those good ways that God has said? Do you know what it is? It's not 1940.
[time=2822] It's not the Church of 1950. The good old days are not what is being emphasized here, but the ancient path became a way of direction.
[time=2834] Turn over to the seventh chapter, verse 22, "For when I brought your forefathers out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, but I gave them this command.
[time=2850] Oh, baby, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Walk in all the ways I commend you. The ancient paths.
[time=2863] The way that is the way that is good is the way of God and His commands. The way that God led them into life, not death, and the way that God provided and protected them."
[time=2877] Go back to the second chapter of Jeremiah, Jeremiah chapter 2, verse 6. He said, "They did not ask where is the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness."
[time=2893] Verse 17, "Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the Lord your God when He led you in the way?" Now why go to Egypt and drink the water from that black Nile?
[time=2905] Why go to Assyrian, drink water from the river Euphrates? Why go back to Egypt? Why go to Euphrates? I let you out of bondage in the way. What is the ancient path?
[time=2919] It was the way that led them out of bondage into a land of blessing. It was a way where God had protected them, provided for them, where God's presence was with them.
[time=2930] And God said, "I made this known to you by my commands. The law of God becomes a direction for life." Psalm 1 declares, "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the council of the ungodly, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful, but his or her delight is in the law of the Lord."
[time=2954] And in his law that he meditate day and night, you're like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth fruit in its season. The leaf does not wither, and whatsoever you do, it will prosper, it will know its full potential.
[time=2970] The ungodly, not so. But they're like the chaff, which the wind driveth away. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish. There are two ways.
[time=2984] There is a way that seems right unto man, and when you come to the crossroads, when you come to the roundabouts of life, you make decisions. There is a way that seems right, but the end thereof is destruction and death.
[time=2999] Moses said, "I set before you this day good and evil, life and death, choose life, choose life. What is that life? What is that way?
[time=3015] Unless it is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly, who does not walk following the advice of those who have loose themselves from God's standard, but his delight is in the law of the Lord. The law is not some kind of a straight jacket.
[time=3033] The law was able to give us the character of God. What's the first commandment? "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Do you know what it is when man walks the road of honoring the God who created him, designed him for a purpose?
[time=3053] To honor God so that I do not take his name in vain, to honor God so that I build a relationship and trust is there, that my word is my bond. I don't lie.
[time=3065] The tenth commandment, "Thou shalt not covet, when man's heart is lifted up and pride for his envy of what he wants."
[time=3073] Even Paul said it would slay me, but God would teach me that if I would honor him, it would build a relationship with him and with others.
[time=3085] And then when I find I so fail to walk that way, one day there came one who said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[time=3097] Come walk and follow me where you fail, I'll forgive, and when you're not able to go on, my spirit will give you power.
[time=3106] Come walk and follow me." But what is that way? What is the way that Jesus Christ offers? He offered the fulfillment of the law.
[time=3116] Jesus Christ did not destroy the law. He fulfilled the law. Why? Because the law is the character of God.
[time=3123] And when you walk and follow God, you don't follow disaster. You follow life. What is your concept of God?
[time=3133] Are you accountable to him as your creator? Does his authority, from his word, the Holy Bible, direct your decisions?
[time=3145] I'm talking about your moral decisions. I'm talking about how you look and how you act and what you say.
[time=3152] I'm talking about what decision you make when you're adding up the figures, the decision you make when you make a choice and a partner, what you do on a date.
[time=3162] What determines your behavior? The authority of God's word that says that if you honor him with your life, if you're trustworthy in your morals, that you'll find rest for your soul, you'll find peace and not a vacuum.
[time=3181] He issues a challenge. Stand at the crossroads. Ask for the ancient paths. The way that brings life not death. See that good way.
[time=3194] That good way that is found in the command of God, the character of God, but fulfilled in the person of his son, Jesus Christ.
[time=3205] And now the choice. Walk in it. Walk in it. It's not just slogans. It's not just coming to church.
[time=3215] The word walk means it becomes your life. It means now that I've committed myself to not only saying I'm a Christian, but through the power of Jesus Christ my life.
[time=3227] I walk in obedience and I follow him. Do you honor God? First command as your creator? Do you honor his word and what he has said? Does it have authority over your life?
[time=3248] Do you honor his son by receiving Jesus Christ as your savior and serving him with the abilities that he has given you? Do you follow him?
[time=3264] One of the privileges of being with day of discovery and radio Bible class is to know the integrity of a ministry on television and radio and printing for many years.
[time=3276] And one of the privileges of standing in this pulpit today is to stand behind a pulpit where the young man who stood here and preached the Word of God preached with integrity of life and of purpose and of morals.
[time=3293] But we visited on day of discovery on location in South America and we had the privilege of bringing the story again of the five young missionaries who had been martyred by the Oka Indians in Ecuador.
[time=3308] I had been a student at Wheaton College when those five young men had gone into those jungles and that morning when Dr. Edmond announced that five young soldiers of the cross had fallen, it affected each of our lives.
[time=3323] Three of those men were from Wheaton, one had been a captain of the football team, a national oratory honor student and winner, brilliant, powerful, a leader of men.
[time=3337] Another was a brilliant genius pilot because his genius could create things that were practical. Pilots still use it today for safety.
[time=3349] The third was a man of God who wrote deep words who said a man is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.
[time=3362] A man is no fool to be a minister, a flame of fire, all that God would make me dangerous. Jim Elliot, Nate St, Ed McCauley, five young men went into those jungles.
[time=3375] They befriended the Indians, but in a surprise attack before they ever were able to preach to them, they were martyred for the cause of Christ, brutally killed.
[time=3386] Two months later, two women, the wife of Jim Elliot, Elizabeth, and the sister of Nate St, Rachel, went into the Aka Indians.
[time=3398] Elizabeth stayed a few years, Rachel stayed 32 years. We flew in to see Rachel and the Akais. Now the killers have become believers.
[time=3410] Now there's a new generation of believers and over a hundred believers met as they came from their various housing areas and they came from their little huts and clearings into one for a service.
[time=3423] They sang the praises of God, but the most moving of all was when we stood by the banks of the river where they had murdered those missionaries, the son of Nate St had come back for the first time since he was 15.
[time=3438] When he was 15, he had gone to that area and with his aunt, he had left the men that had killed his father, baptized him and his sister.
[time=3448] The men who had murdered his father baptized him. Now he was back for the first time and he said, "Kimo, Comey, Dewey, since you baptized me, I have walked the trail for God.
[time=3464] Do you still walk the trail for God?" And old friends to hear those Akais.
[time=3472] To hear them say 32 years later, "Kimo, I walk the trail for God. Comey, I walk the trail for God. Dewey, I walk the trail for God."
[time=3491] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our sanctuary choir in orchestra, mirror, Brian Loessett and our string quartet.
[time=3499] The message today was from our special guest Dr. David Burnham.
[time=3503] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your Savior, just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3512] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3519] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to forgive me of my sins and be my Savior today.
[time=3527] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3531] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
