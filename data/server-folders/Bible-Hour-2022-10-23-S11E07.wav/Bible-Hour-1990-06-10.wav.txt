[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=60] (bells ringing) You know, reading the paper today can be frightening experience.
[time=89] Sometimes it seems like the world is out of control.
[time=93] But is it really, or are there forces happening that influence or even determine the events that happen around us, or even the things that happen in our own lives?
[time=102] And in the middle of all that, what park is God play?
[time=105] How much does he influence?
[time=108] How much does he control?
[time=110] These are some of the questions we wanted to discuss today as we consider the topic holding the hand of Providence.
[time=117] (bells ringing) - Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music
[time=128] and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.

[time=857] They've been great messages and we've been delighted to share them with you and I hope that you've stayed tuned to the Bible Hour each week.
[time=864] If you're in the Fort Wayne area today, there's still time to get to the Black Hawk Baptist Church for a special event.
[time=871] We're having the Light International's Ensemble with us today.
[time=875] They're from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.
[time=879] Recently they traveled to Eastern Europe and South America and they'll be presenting a multimedia presentation tonight in our evening service at 6 p.m.
[time=889] So if you're in this area, come and join us for our morning worship services at 9.15 and 10.50
[time=895] and then we'll be here tonight at 6 p.m. for Light International's presentation of Eastern Europe and South America.
[time=903] It's not too many weeks away before we celebrate our annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=909] This year's Patriotic Panorama is entitled "I Believe in America" and will be given on Sunday, July 1st at 4 p.m.
[time=917] Our choir will be singing "We Will Have a Special Guest" Gary McSpadden will be with us.
[time=923] If you remember that name, he's sang for a number of years with the Gather Vocal Band has been involved in praise gatherings in Indianapolis and also has sung several times right here in our own Coliseum in Fort Wayne.
[time=935] So set that date aside, that's July 1st at 4 p.m.
[time=939] for the annual Patriotic Panorama "I Believe in America" We've had a number of guests on here and we've had some of our own staff with me here in the insert and today I'm delighted to introduce to you again Tim Teder, our youth pastor.
[time=953] Good morning Tim.
[time=954] Morning Pete.
[time=956] When you look at our bulletin, you see a number of ministries that are listed, Tim.
[time=960] And one of those is Turn Point Ministries and you're very much involved in that.
[time=965] That's your area. Tell us what Turn Point Ministries is all about.
[time=968] Pete, we're excited about our youth ministry and the things it does for junior and senior high students.
[time=973] We've called our youth ministry Turn Point youth ministries taken out of an Old Testament passage where Solomon is praying, dedicating the people to God.
[time=981] And in this prayer he says, "May God turn our hearts toward him to walk in all his ways." And the purpose of our youth ministry is to create a youth group in which God will turn the hearts of students to love him and to change their world for him.
[time=993] And we're excited to see that happening in lives of students.
[time=996] That's really great Tim and we are grateful for your ministry and your wife Connie's ministry to our young people.
[time=1002] There's a great need out there for people to love them and to be concerned about them and to have a continual growth in their lives.
[time=1009] You have a lot of special events.
[time=1011] We enjoy them when the young people come back from various operation, outreach from the south and hear about other events that we don't get to see but happen.
[time=1020] Are there some specific events coming up?
[time=1022] Well, we always look forward to summer because of some of our big trips and fun events.
[time=1027] Two of the primary events coming up this summer.
[time=1029] For senior high we've got a rafting and camping trip out in Pennsylvania and that happens the end of June.
[time=1035] And then end of July, beginning of August, the junior hires will be going to Upper Michigan spending a week canoeing and camping along the Osaboe River up there.
[time=1043] Tim, do you have to be a member to get involved in those kinds of activities?
[time=1048] Well, of course, we would encourage students to be involved in their own youth group but if they're free and they want to be a part of what we're doing they're welcome to come along.
[time=1055] Oh, that's great.
[time=1056] And those are exciting events for teenagers.
[time=1058] Not only does Tim work with our youth but he's a great pastor teacher and often he speaks in our evening services and in the next two weeks we have the privilege of having Tim on the Bible hour and I'm sure in a few moments you're looking forward to his message as I am.
[time=1074] Tim, tell us a little bit about the next two weeks and the topics that you'll be speaking on.
[time=1079] Well, the topic is holding the hand of Providence.
[time=1082] Today you want to look at a little bit of learning about what the province of God means and then next week how does that apply in the way we go about making decisions in our own life?
[time=1091] Well, Tim, we're delighted that you're speaking and we look forward to those messages and we're also delighted that you're part of our staff.
[time=1099] The men on our staff have just done a valiant job in keeping the ministries of Black Hawk Baptist Church
[time=1105] and the Bible hour going and we're delighted that they've just taken on extra staff responsibilities
[time=1111] and are continuing all of the ministries here that we have at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1116] This is the last time that I'm going to tell you about the pamphlet we've been advertising in May entitled Confronting Casual Christianity.
[time=1124] Once again, this is a series of messages by our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=1129] If you'd like to receive a copy of Confronting Casual Christianity, simply write us right here at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1143] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1152] Thank you, Tim, again for joining me on this insert and we look forward in a few minutes to your message.
[time=1157] But before Tim speaks, let's listen to the ensemble from Black Hawk Christian School as they sing for us.
[time=1174] So far, it's been so good so far.
[time=1181] Through all the joys and scars, you find the battles in my heart.
[time=1192] I long for unto you having stored another open door.
[time=1202] Should I stay here or look for more?
[time=1208] So far you've brought me, so far you've dropped me, so far that everything I need.
[time=1222] You are new, and now we're never trying to tell.
[time=1231] I've got the choice to make.
[time=1235] I can't believe we've come, so far.
[time=1245] You say the fight has just begun, and yet the battle's won by trusting in your whole reason.
[time=1264] You know the plans you have for me.
[time=1271] I'm trying to believe that my eyes can only see.
[time=1279] So far, so far you've brought me, so far you've dropped me, so far that everything I need.
[time=1293] You are new, and now we're never trying to tell.
[time=1303] I've got the choice to make.
[time=1307] I can't believe we've come, so far.
[time=1323] Through, through, through, through.
[time=1329] And now we're never trying to tell.
[time=1335] I've got the choice to make.
[time=1339] I can't believe we've come, so far.
[time=1353] So far.
[time=1367] Let's pray.
[time=1372] Sometimes that seems so far that you have brought us.
[time=1377] It's easy to sometimes become discouraged with where we are and who we are, but when we look back at where we've been and how far you've brought us, we're thankful for your guiding hand and your providence.
[time=1388] And when we see what you've done in the past, it gives us confidence for tomorrow, for our lives, once ahead,
[time=1394] because we know that in you we find the ability and the strength to press on, and we thank you for that.
[time=1401] [AMEN]
[time=1412] When the valley is deep, when the mountain is steamed, when the body is weary,
[time=1441] when we stumble and fall, when the choices are hard, when we're battered and scarred,
[time=1463] when we spell our resources, when we've given our own.
[time=1476] In Jesus' name, we press on.
[time=1550] In Lord with the prize, give it one.
[time=1564] We'll find that strength to press on.
[time=1603] Great assurances we've heard in the last two songs that have been sung, that God is at work leading us and guiding us and bringing us to where we are,
[time=1612] and that God is at work and determining where he will be and giving us the strength to be the kinds of people he wants us to be, to go where he wants us to go.
[time=1622] Have you ever thought about this question, why do things happen?
[time=1629] What makes things happen?
[time=1633] And have you ever had a circumstance in your life that when it occurred, you stepped back and thought, well, the chances of that taking place?
[time=1640] What a coincidence.
[time=1642] 1979, I spent a summer at a missions program in Europe, especially spending time in Turkey.
[time=1651] One Friday, I was with my team of four other guys in our van waiting in a fuel line in the city of Istanbul.
[time=1659] There was a shortage of fuel, and so we were in a long line waiting for our van to be filled up.
[time=1665] And the past the time we got out of the van and began meeting some of the people around us, and there were some students behind our van that were able to speak some English, one in particular.
[time=1675] Our college student was able to speak English rather well, so we began talking with him, and sharing with him who Jesus Christ was, what he had come to do, again witnessing to him.
[time=1685] Well, he was very interested, and after both our vehicles had been fueled up, he invited us over to his apartment, and we spent the next three and a half hours conversing with five Turkish students sharing the message of Jesus Christ.
[time=1699] The one especially Marat was very interested, wanted to know more, and we told him what we could, and we needed to leave, so we prayed for him and asked that God would continue to show him truth, gave him some literature, and we left during the course of the next week.
[time=1712] We left Istanbul and traveled a full day's journey to the large city of Izmir, and continued our work there.
[time=1722] It was a week later from our meeting Marat, we were in Izmir, it was late in the day, we were fixing our meal by a campfire, and things had been drawn out during the course of the day, we were late in our schedule, we needed to get out and do a few last things in our work before the day ended.
[time=1740] We finally got things packed up in the van, took off, headed into the city again, stopped at a stoplight, as we stopped at the light, we noticed the car in front of us, a little white car with a hand reaching out, the wind waving wildly, and we thought, well this is kind of strange, and then the head poked out, and it was Marat.
[time=1756] We didn't know he was going to be there, he didn't know we were going to be there, but he motioned us over and said, "You know, I've been thinking about what you told me, and I wanted to know more about this Jesus, and been hoping I could find you again."
[time=1768] Now the chances of his finding us again would be something similar to you going down to Indianapolis today, and wandering around, pulling up to a shell station or other gas station, and getting out and meeting someone that you didn't know, striking up a conversation, developing a little bit of a friendship, and then during the next week you travel to Pittsburgh.
[time=1787] And you're traveling next Sunday afternoon around Pittsburgh, and you stop at a stoplight, and there in front of you is the person that you just met a week ago in Indianapolis.
[time=1797] How do you look at a situation like that? Do you think, what a coincidence, isn't that amazing? Or is there a force of power that comes into play beyond coincidence and chance?
[time=1808] What about the kind of person you are seated in that pew today? Why are you who you are? Why do you look the way that you do, and some of you ask that same question every morning?
[time=1823] Some time back, your father felt a little romantic, and fortunately your mother didn't have a headache that day, and there's two sets of very unique chromosomes came together and formed a new set of chromosomes that was going to end up being someone unlike anybody else.
[time=1845] And you were born with the hair, the eyes, the health, the body build, because of these two sets of chromosomes that came together.
[time=1856] You were born and given a name that you didn't choose, you were born into an environment that you couldn't control, and all those things together have, in a large part, made you the kind of person that you are today.
[time=1867] Why? Is it simply natural cause and effect, principle, human effort? How do we explain these things?
[time=1877] Just chance, or is there something even bigger that comes into play into making you who you are?
[time=1885] What about something less significant? What about the throwing of a die?
[time=1892] If I throw this die on the platform and it comes up a one, why did it come up a one?
[time=1901] Chance? You throw it enough times and probably one out of six times it's going to come up a one.
[time=1908] Or is there even in this a power that comes into play that governs even the small aspects of life?
[time=1915] What we're talking about here is the question of control. What controls the events and the circumstances and the things around this?
[time=1922] Is it nature and the laws of nature that control these things?
[time=1926] Is it human effort that brings about change that controls events?
[time=1930] Is it some impersonal fate that causes things to happen?
[time=1934] Or is there a God that decrees that certain events will take place, certain things will happen?
[time=1942] Of course, we're talking about providence.
[time=1946] This morning I'm going to talk about holding the hand of providence.
[time=1952] Actually, this is the first of four sermons I'd like to preach on this topic of holding the hand of providence.
[time=1958] And today, I want to specifically look at learning about the providence of God.
[time=1965] Now, when I first titled this, I gave the title understanding the providence of God.
[time=1969] But I thought that was a little presumptuous to think that we'd all be able to leave here in 30 minutes and walk out the doors and understand the providence of God.
[time=1977] But at least we can learn something of what God's providence is and what it means in our life and in the world around us.
[time=1983] And I want to ask three questions. First of all, what is providence?
[time=1986] Secondly, what is affected by God's providence?
[time=1990] And thirdly, why should I be concerned with God's providence?
[time=1995] First of all, what is providence? We ask that question and some might say, "Well, providence means that God sees everything and we know that's true."
[time=2007] Matthew chapter 6, it tells us that God sees the things that even we do in secret, the things that no one else sees, God sees.
[time=2015] It tells us in Matthew chapter 10 that God sees every detail of our life.
[time=2019] He even sees the hairs of our head and numbers them.
[time=2024] For some of us, that's harder than for others. But God does that.
[time=2027] You think of how difficult that would be to pick one person with an average set of hair in this audience
[time=2033] and how long would it take for us to count the number of hairs than that person said?
[time=2037] How many hairs would we lose in the process and have to subtract?
[time=2040] And then as that person went about the course of the day and brushed their hand through their head and the hairs fall and we're subtracting
[time=2047] and as they brushed their hair in the morning, we count the hairs surrounding the drain after a shower and we're constantly throughout the day adding and subtracting the hairs on the head.
[time=2054] See, God does that not just for one person, but for everybody in this audience, for everyone in the world, and it's not even hard.
[time=2060] He doesn't sit around, "Oh, here, Angel, make that other calculation." He just does it because God sees everything. He knows when it happened. He sees it take place.
[time=2069] It doesn't take any effort because God's God.
[time=2073] Hebrews 4-13, it says, "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight." Everything is uncovered. God sees everything.
[time=2080] God is provident, but God's providence is more than His seeing.
[time=2087] They say, "Okay, God knows everything." Providence of God means that God knows everything that has happened, that will happen, knows everything about everything.
[time=2098] And we know that's true as well.
[time=2101] Romans 11, "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how insertible His judgments."
[time=2109] And it goes on to say, "Who can know the mind of God? Who can be His counselor?" God knows everything. He's provident, but providence is more than that.
[time=2118] Let me suggest this definition of providence.
[time=2121] Providence is the control of God.
[time=2125] Providence is the control of God directing everything to its appropriate goal.
[time=2131] Let me say it again. Providence is the control of God as He works to direct everything to the goal that He has said is good and appropriate.
[time=2141] That's what providence is.
[time=2143] And it leads us to the question, "What is affected by God's providence?" Is God concerned about the big issues, the big details, the big events of life and creation in the cosmos?
[time=2154] And the little things kind of slip in there where they will, or is God's hand of providence even directing even the little minute details of life?
[time=2163] What is affected by the providence of God?
[time=2165] We go to Scripture and I would suggest these things are affected by God's providence.
[time=2168] First of all, natural events are affected by the providence of God.
[time=2174] Nature around us, the things that we call natural circumstances, natural causes, natural events.
[time=2180] You know, there was a time when there were a lot of things that we'd look around and people would see the lightning, people would see famine and disease.
[time=2187] They'd see the things that would happen and they would attribute supernatural causes to these things because we couldn't understand them.
[time=2193] We couldn't explain why light flashed across the sky.
[time=2196] We couldn't understand why someone would get sick and that sickness would be passed on to someone else.
[time=2201] So they attributed it to a work, an act of some supernatural being, either God or demonic, good or evil.
[time=2208] These are supernatural things, but now, hey, we live in an age of discovery.
[time=2212] We live in an age of understanding.
[time=2214] We know that these things have cause and effect and we can understand something of their cause.
[time=2218] It's no mystery for us for lightning and thunder.
[time=2221] We can explain these things in scientific terms and we can test these things.
[time=2225] We can even recreate them to some extent in laboratories.
[time=2230] And so we begin to think that things happen just because of the natural laws of nature.
[time=2235] When certain things are established they run that way and because of certain causes there are certain effects.
[time=2240] And if we're not careful as Christians we begin to think that way even as Christians we begin to think that somehow, maybe God had his hand in the beginning in the creation of everything.
[time=2249] Somehow we got it all started, but now he's removed from it and he sets certain laws and certain principles and motions
[time=2255] and now they just continue to go on and God sets back and lets it happen, sometimes stepping into intervene when things get a little bit out of hand.
[time=2262] But in the course of events he just lets things go along according to the natural laws and principles that he's established.
[time=2268] It's like God is a cosmic watchmaker who has gone into great detail,
[time=2275] created this magnificent watch and he's winded it up and set it up, thrown it out into space and there it goes and it's ticking and it's running and God lets it happen.
[time=2284] And somehow if God were removed from the scene the watch would continue to tick at least for a while until someone needed to wind it up again.
[time=2291] But I suggest that what Scripture tells us about God's provenance even in natural events is more than that.
[time=2300] God not only created but God as it works sustaining continually keeping together and moving everything that he said in motion from the beginning.
[time=2310] You see we can look at a tree and we can try scientifically through biology, explain the course of events, why that seed bursts open and how it begins to grow. But where does the life come from?
[time=2321] And I suggest that behind every cause that we can measure by science there is a greater cause and that is God is at work.
[time=2328] And if God stopped to be at work for an instant there would be no nature.
[time=2335] If I take a hymnal and I hold it up and I let go of it you know it's not just going to stay up here in space,
[time=2345] it's going to fall to the ground because of gravity.
[time=2348] We know the law of nature, we know gravity is at work but why does gravity work?
[time=2353] What is the force behind the cause? That's something we can't even understand or explain.
[time=2357] What it is that makes gravity work and I suggest that God is the cause behind the other causes that bring events to play.
[time=2364] In Scripture it tells us that God is the one who covers the sky with clouds.
[time=2369] God is the one who brings rain, God is the one who causes the grass to grow.
[time=2373] And more importantly, Colossians 1-17 is talking about Jesus Christ.
[time=2377] It says that Jesus was before all things and in him all things continue to be held together.
[time=2384] It says the same thing in Hebrews when it says that the sun is the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.
[time=2394] Now by his word he created all things but not only did he create them but he continues to hold them together
[time=2400] and move them according to his purpose.
[time=2404] Natural events.
[time=2407] God controls natural events directing everything to its proper goal.
[time=2412] I believe God controls world events. World events are affected by God's provenance.
[time=2419] Daniel realized this.
[time=2422] In Daniel chapter 2, Daniel is praising God and he says, "Praise be to the name of God forever and ever.
[time=2428] Wisdom and power are his. He changes times and season. He sets up kings and deposes them."
[time=2434] It goes on to say later that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.
[time=2444] World events are affected. When we think of world events, we're brought to mind the great wars of the history of our world.
[time=2453] And we think of wars, when we think of nations going to wars, we think of the leaders as they sit down to strategize and to plan
[time=2460] and to figure out how they can be equipped, best equipped to win the war.
[time=2464] And yet how is the outcome of the war determined?
[time=2467] We might measure it by military strength or planning or cunning and yet even this is guided within the providence of God.
[time=2475] It says in Proverbs 21, "The horse is made ready for the day of battle but victory rests with the Lord."
[time=2482] God controls world events directing everything to its proper goal.
[time=2486] Even small events, things that we would think insignificant even these are affected by the providence of God.
[time=2493] We're told that not one sparrow falls to the ground unless the father wills it.
[time=2501] In Proverbs 1633 it says that the lot, the dice are cast into the lap but its very decision comes from the Lord.
[time=2513] God controls even the small events directing everything to its proper goal.
[time=2518] We may think why should God care?
[time=2520] Why should God care?
[time=2523] Maybe we'll understand that a little bit more as we go on.
[time=2528] Personal events I believe are affected.
[time=2530] Personal events of your life are affected by the providence of God.
[time=2533] David realized this and he said in Psalm 139, "All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."
[time=2542] In Proverbs it tells us that a man's steps are directed by the Lord.
[time=2545] How can anyone understand his own ways?
[time=2550] I think James had this in mind when he told us how we ought to think about our lives and how we plan for the future.
[time=2557] He said you need to recognize the role of God's providence in your life.
[time=2561] You may go about planning to do certain things using your effort to bring certain things about
[time=2567] but you understand that you are working within the providence of God and God determines God wills whether things will happen or whether they won't happen.
[time=2574] And he says instead of saying, "Well tomorrow I'm going to go to such and such a city.
[time=2577] I'm going to set up a business and get all kinds of money during the course of the next year." James says you ought not to talk that way.
[time=2582] You ought to talk instead if God wills these things will happen.
[time=2588] We recognize the providence of God.
[time=2592] God controls your personal events directing everything to its proper goal.
[time=2597] We could sum it up saying this that I believe all things are affected by the providence of God.
[time=2605] God directs all things directing everything to its proper goal, controls all things.
[time=2614] See, I don't think there's anything that frustrates God.
[time=2616] I don't think there's anything that happens that God steps back and goes, "Whoa!" Boy, I didn't plan on that.
[time=2622] Now what are we going to have to do?
[time=2623] Angels come around here, little meeting, the triune God has a little huddle.
[time=2628] The side boy, what's the next plan of action?
[time=2630] Because we've got to work through this one. This was unexpected.
[time=2633] Nothing frustrates God.
[time=2635] Nothing florts or messes up God's plan or God's purpose.
[time=2640] Nothing is out of his control or beyond his control.
[time=2644] Nothing.
[time=2645] R.C. Sproul explains it in these terms. He says there's not even one maverick molecule in the universe doing its own thing.
[time=2654] Everything is under the control of God because if there was just even that one maverick molecule or one apparently insignificant event that is outside of the control of God,
[time=2664] then there is the possibility that that one molecule or that one event can change the course of history and alter things in such a way that God's purpose is sidetracked.
[time=2674] There's that possibility. You might say, well, that's so minute to one molecule.
[time=2678] What difference is it going to make? Is it possible even if you're talking about such an infinitesimal chance possibility?
[time=2687] Is it possible? Yes. If there's even that little of a possibility, that means that there is something that is outside of the control of God.
[time=2694] It means there is some area that God is not sovereign in.
[time=2697] I suggest it means that God, if he is not sovereign, is not God. Everything fits within the provenance of God, all things.
[time=2708] I don't know about you, but when I consider this truth, when I looked at Scripture to an understanding what it means that God is a prominent God,
[time=2717] in his sovereignty, as he moves and directs things, a lot of questions came to mind.
[time=2722] And this one that I want us to consider this morning is the question of if it is true that God in his provenance moves and controls and directs in all things, what about things that aren't good?
[time=2733] What about things that are bad? Does God's provenance even include evil? Does God control and direct events that are wrong, that are evil, that are bad, does God cause people to sin?
[time=2745] It's a hard question to answer, isn't it? And we're not going to do it in 10 minutes.
[time=2749] Certainly something that is thought about and written about and debated over the course of centuries, but I do think we can think about some things when it comes to this question.
[time=2758] Some things we do know. We do know that God has no evil, badness, sin in him. We know that, don't we?
[time=2766] The Bible says God is perfectly holy. He's righteous. There is no trace of sin. There's no shadow of turning within God.
[time=2773] We also know that God does not tempt us or direct us or cause us to sin or do evil or to do bad, don't we?
[time=2780] James tells us that God does not sin, nor does he tempt anyone else to sin.
[time=2785] But somehow in the midst of all this, I believe God's provenance even governs evil.
[time=2792] It even oversees and directs in the things that are wrong and bad so that they will achieve his good purpose and his good ends.
[time=2800] See, God in his provenance ordained and decreed that creatures would be created with the capacity for evil.
[time=2810] And that fits within his sovereign provenance. Why would he do that?
[time=2817] Why would he create a universe, create a world, create creatures like angels and men and women with a capacity for evil?
[time=2824] When that question is asked, one of the first answers I hear from many people is this.
[time=2830] See, God had to create us with the freedom of choice or else we'd be robots.
[time=2838] And God didn't want to make us robots.
[time=2842] And I understand the intent of that statement but I'm a little bit uncomfortable with it. Let me tell you why, let me ask you a question.
[time=2847] In heaven will we sin? In heaven will we want to sin? In heaven will we have the choice to sin?
[time=2861] We won't. In heaven will we be robots? No.
[time=2867] You see, we look at freedom of choice, we look at the freedom to choose to sin as a virtue, as if somehow that makes us better, more free.
[time=2875] But when I look at Scripture I see sin as a slavery, as a bondage.
[time=2879] When I'm really free I will no longer be hassled by temptation and hassled by sin.
[time=2884] That isn't more, that doesn't make me more, that makes me less.
[time=2888] And someday I will be free from that and I will be perfectly free to worship God in perfect obedience.
[time=2894] Never bothered by sin anymore and I won't be a robot.
[time=2897] Now why couldn't God just made us that way from the very beginning?
[time=2900] Could He have? I believe He could have.
[time=2903] I believe He could have. Why didn't He? Was it so there'd be a time of testing, a time of choosing?
[time=2909] Why didn't He just from the very beginning make us creatures like we will be eventually?
[time=2916] And here's my answer.
[time=2919] I don't know. I wish I did, because you know, it just doesn't make sense to me.
[time=2927] But here's where we can have confidence in the provenance of God.
[time=2932] When we can look at circumstances that are not good, that are wrong, that are evil, and yet know that somehow God's purposes and all that are good.
[time=2940] What God is leading to, what God is directing to is good, even though we look at the moments of evil and badness and wrong, and it doesn't make sense to us.
[time=2948] We can still have confidence that God is achieving His purpose to a good end.
[time=2953] Let me just mention a few examples in Scripture when God used evil and bad to accomplish His good end.
[time=2960] You're familiar with the story of Joseph, who was looked at with great jealousy by his brothers, because he was favored by his father.
[time=2971] The brothers were so jealous that they decided to kill him, and one of the brothers kind of thwarted that plan, and it changed, so they decided they'd sell him into slavery.
[time=2980] Joseph was sold in the slavery through the jealousy, through the jealous motives, the hatred of his brothers.
[time=2986] And you know the story, he went to Egypt, he was falsely accused by his boss's wife, he spent time in prison, until eventually Joseph became second in command of all the land of Egypt.
[time=2998] Down the road years later, his brothers are sent by their father to Egypt to get food during the famine.
[time=3008] And during a course of events, Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, and his brothers are terrified.
[time=3013] Here's this one that they sold in the slavery, and now he is a ruler in Egypt.
[time=3019] And Joseph says a very interesting thing to them.
[time=3022] Genesis, chapter 50, verse 20, he said, you know what you intended for evil, and it was evil what they did, but what you intended for evil, God intended for good.
[time=3034] See, God's providence worked even through the wrong to bring about God's good.
[time=3039] I mean, the brothers weren't forced coerced by God into doing something wrong, but he did it willingly, and yet God in his providence worked even through that to bring about his good.
[time=3050] And it was God's providence and his plan for those things to happen to bring about what he wanted.
[time=3059] So Joseph and his brothers and his family came to Egypt, and they grew, and during the course of time they grew into the nation that we know of Israel.
[time=3067] And over a few hundred years later, no longer are they the welcome guests in Egypt, but they are the slaves of the Egyptians.
[time=3074] And God raises up a leader, Moses, to lead his people out of Egypt.
[time=3078] And remember the story? God tells Moses to go to Pharaoh and say, let my people go, and what happens to Pharaoh?
[time=3085] Over and over in Exodus we see the phrase that Pharaoh hardened his heart.
[time=3089] And right along with that we see the phrase that God hardened Pharaoh's heart.
[time=3094] We need to understand that. Sometimes that confuses us and we think, you mean God?
[time=3098] God made Pharaoh disobey his own command?
[time=3102] And the heartening of Pharaoh's heart by God was not that God went in and caused Pharaoh to sin, it simply means that God stepped back.
[time=3110] And he withheld his grace from Pharaoh's heart, and he let Pharaoh do what his heart inclined him to do.
[time=3115] And that was rebelled against God's decree and God's command, and his heart was hardened.
[time=3120] And it was something that was wrong, his disobedience to God, and yet God used that as a vehicle to bring about his purpose, his ends.
[time=3130] Now let me ask you a question. Could God have moved Pharaoh's heart to compassion?
[time=3135] Could God have done that to allow the Israelites to go instead of stepping away and hardening Pharaoh's heart?
[time=3141] Could God have moved his heart to compassion? Yes.
[time=3144] We see that sometime later in Israel's history that Cyrus, King of Persia, it tells us that God moved in Cyrus's heart so that he would build the temple in Jerusalem.
[time=3157] God could have done that for Pharaoh, he didn't. Why didn't he do it?
[time=3161] Perhaps it was to raise up stronger a leader like Moses.
[time=3165] Perhaps it was to help the Israelites trust in this God that they were following, that they couldn't see, but learn to trust in him.
[time=3170] I don't know, but all I know is God had his good ends. He had his good reasons, and God in his providence even used a wrong decision of Pharaoh to bring about his good ends.
[time=3181] Probably the most significant example of God using evil to bring about his good and his providence is the example of the cross.
[time=3188] Because what was the motive of Judas? It was betrayal.
[time=3194] What was the motive of the religious leaders of Jesus' day? It was hatred, it was jealousy.
[time=3199] What was the motive of the people that yelled out crucify him? It was hatred.
[time=3203] What was the motive of Satan? It was to thwart the plan of God, to kill the son of God, to put an end of this thing that God was doing.
[time=3213] And you know what God used every one of those motives to bring about his intention.
[time=3220] And God decreed that all those things would happen to bring about his intention.
[time=3227] God's providence ruled even in disobedience and evil to bring about what he had decreed would be good.
[time=3236] We have to be careful. We can't use this as an excuse to sin, or to have a fatalistic approach to things.
[time=3242] Well, you know, God just kind of decrees what's going to happen.
[time=3245] We still have an obligation. We still have a responsibility, and God holds us accountable.
[time=3249] And God hates sin in our life. And yet we have this assurance that even disobedience and sin is not out of the control of God,
[time=3256] that frustrates him and he thinks, "Oh, what are we going to do now? Better stamp out these fires that are starting to be scattered around."
[time=3262] Even these things work within the plan and the purpose of God.
[time=3266] We may not understand how or why, but we can have every assurance and every confidence that it works together for a good ends, a good purpose.
[time=3277] So what? What difference should that make to me that God is a provident God?
[time=3284] Well, if you are away from God, if you are apart from God, then his providence to you is your fear.
[time=3294] It really should be. When you recognize that God is this kind of God, and you have no relationship with this kind of God,
[time=3300] then it should strike some kind of fear into your life to know that you cannot hide from this kind of God,
[time=3306] to know that you cannot undo his purpose, to know that you can't set his course aside, to know that you cannot somehow get out of judgment and facing this God.
[time=3317] His purposes will be accomplished. You will face this kind of sovereign God, this God of providence someday.
[time=3325] God and his providence made a way for you to escape judgment.
[time=3328] God and his providence sent Jesus Christ to come, to die on a cross, to be the sacrifice, to take the place, the penalty for our disobedience.
[time=3338] God and his providence did that. God and his providence brought you here today, each one of us in his providence.
[time=3345] God and his providence did all that, and yet you have a responsibility of what you do with that kind of God.
[time=3351] Do you reach out to hold his hand? Do you respond in repentance and fall down before God and beg his mercy?
[time=3360] Or do you react against that kind of God and run away because you want to control your own life?
[time=3365] If it won't happen, God's providence is certain. His ends are sure.
[time=3371] How about for those of us who trust in God, who have that desire to be close to God and we draw close to Him?
[time=3377] What does it mean to us? You know, for us it's our comfort.
[time=3381] To know that all things are under the hand of God is our comfort.
[time=3386] It is only if God is a control of every situation, that God is provident in every situation, is only then that Romans 828 can be true.
[time=3397] Romans 828 says that everything, all things work together for good.
[time=3404] For those that love God to those that are called according to His purpose, everything.
[time=3411] You guys with that saying that there's not one event in your life that comes into your life without passing through the sovereign, provident hands of God.
[time=3420] And every event in your life has a purpose and it directs towards an end that is good.
[time=3426] Now that doesn't mean that every event in your life is good. It certainly doesn't mean that.
[time=3431] It doesn't say in Romans 828 we know that all things are good, that all things aren't good, but it says that all things work together for good.
[time=3438] And why? Because God is a provident God. That's the only way that that promise can be possible.
[time=3446] If God is provident in every circumstance of life.
[time=3452] You know what that means? It means we don't have to despair.
[time=3456] It means that we don't have to be bitter when things don't go our way.
[time=3460] The pains come to us we want to give up. Instead we can turn to a provident God. We can say I can trust you.
[time=3469] I trust you. I know you're good and I know you're in control.
[time=3489] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir, the ladies ensemble from Blackhawk Christian School and soloist Bob Vanetta.
[time=3498] The message today was from our associate youth pastor Tim Teder.
[time=3502] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3510] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm grateful that I can bow today and ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed
[time=3518] and ask you to come into my heart and be my Savior today.
[time=3523] I thank you for this opportunity and I thank you for the privilege that I have of knowing you as my Savior.
[time=3530] Come into my heart today in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3535] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your prayer?
