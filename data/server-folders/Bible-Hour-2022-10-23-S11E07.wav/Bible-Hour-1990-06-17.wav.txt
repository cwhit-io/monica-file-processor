[time=915] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour again.
[time=921] If you turned on your TV set last week and expected to see the Bible Hour, no doubt you were surprised that there was some other programming going on.
[time=930] That was the children's miracle network and we were just pre-empted for one week and we're back on at our regular time and we're glad that you tuned in today.
[time=939] You've already heard our special group today, Light International.
[time=943] They're a group of young people from Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia and they are going in about one week.
[time=949] They will be going to Eastern Europe and South America for a missionary endeavor and we're just delighted that we have the opportunity to have them here before they leave on that international trip.
[time=961] For a number of you, we have had prayer requests that you've sent in and as a staff, we've prayed for you and those specific requests.
[time=969] Now today, I'd like to tell you about a request that we'd like to have you pray for.
[time=974] In a few moments, our youth pastor, Tim Teder, will be speaking and his little daughter, Alia, is very ill.
[time=981] She's only six months old and I'd like to have you say a special prayer for her and the family, the Teder family, throughout this week that God will intervene and just strengthen that little baby right now.
[time=993] That's a very difficult time for the Teder's and we want to call on you to just pray for them right now.
[time=999] I'm kind of excited about the special guests that are coming during the month of June, one in particular, his name is Dr. Charles Wagner.
[time=1007] Dr. Wagner is the president of Grand Rapids Baptist College in Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[time=1014] I've known him for many years.
[time=1015] When I was on the West Coast, he was also on the West Coast in Tacoma, Washington at the Temple Baptist Church and Northwest Seminary.
[time=1023] He's a prolific writer and we have some literature that we're going to introduce to you throughout this month of June on the Bible Hour.
[time=1030] One in particular this morning is Reflections in Verse.
[time=1034] These are short commentaries that he's written and we'd like to share this booklet with you.
[time=1040] I'd like to share one of the little vignettes from the booklet for you.
[time=1045] It's entitled, "Little Things Do Count." A garment tears from one week thread.
[time=1051] A heart is torn by one word said.
[time=1054] A gossiped word passed on can grow for little things do count, you know.
[time=1059] A pleasant smile, a heartening word can set a saddened heart a stir.
[time=1064] In spite of bane and bitter blows for little things do count, you know.
[time=1069] A mighty minute in our prayer for loved ones low in deep despair could mean a victory or the full for little things do count, you know.
[time=1079] These are the types of Reflections in Verse that are available in this booklet and that's what it's entitled, "Reflections in Verse" by Charles Wagner.
[time=1087] We'd like to offer this booklet to you free of charge if you'll just write to us here at the Bible Hour.
[time=1092] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1100] Once again, that's the Bible Hour.
[time=1102] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1110] And then just a couple months ago, I was up in Dr. Wagner's office and we were talking about his ministry up there and I invited him to come and speak and he'll be with us on June 10th in our morning worship service and on the Bible Hour and he gave me his most recent book.
[time=1125] It's entitled, "Winning Words for Daily Living." And this is a booklet that takes its theme from Isaiah 40-31 and there are four divisions in this book, "Strength for Growing and they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
[time=1140] Truth for soaring, they shall mount up with wings as eagles, training for running, they shall run and not be worry, and light for walking, they shall walk and not faint." This is a booklet of daily devotions that will really make a difference in your life.
[time=1158] I've really enjoyed it and we'd like to offer this booklet to you during the month of June also.
[time=1163] If you will send us $15 or more, we'll send you this booklet, "Winning Words for Daily Living." I'd like to give you the address once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1178] 46815.
[time=1181] We've offered you the booklet free of charge, reflections in verse, and then the booklet, "Winning Ways for Daily Living," you send us $15 or more and we'd be happy to send this booklet to you.
[time=1193] And now just before we close, I want to remind you again that on July 1st, we'll have our annual Patriotic Panorama, "I Believe in America." Our special guest is Gary McSpadden.
[time=1204] He's a former member of the Gather Vocal Band and he will thrill your hearts with his music.
[time=1209] Also, the choir will be singing some great majestic pieces concerning the patriotism of our country and our love for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1218] So that date again is July 1st on Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1225] I hope you'll set that date aside and join us.
[time=1227] We go back now to our live broadcast with the light international singers.
[time=1232] I hope you enjoy their ministry with us and then the message from our associate pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=1241] [MUSIC - 198 seconds]
[time=1463] - There is too much death and darkness around us, and we need to be faithful in holding forth the light.
[time=1471] And letting people see the truth of Jesus Christ in our own lives, and I don't know about you, but I look forward to the day when Jesus Christ, the true light comes and dressed in His white raiment, His powerful steed, and darkness is dispelled thrown away forever.
[time=1489] I know it's gonna happen.
[time=1491] I know the day's coming because God is a God who brings all things to their destined end.
[time=1498] God is a God who sovereign, God is a God who's provident.
[time=1502] Last week we began talking about this providence of God in a series entitled "Holding the Hand of Providence." In case you weren't with us last week, or in case you just need a little refreshing, let me just quickly go through a review of some of the things we talked about last week as we tried to learn something about the providence of God.
[time=1521] We tended to answer these three questions.
[time=1524] First of all, what is providence?
[time=1525] Secondly, what is affected by God's providence?
[time=1528] And then what difference should God's providence make in my life?
[time=1532] When we asked what is providence, we tried to define providence by saying this, providence is the control of God, directing everything to its proper goal.
[time=1544] Providence is the control of God directing everything to its proper goal.
[time=1549] Then the question, well, what is affected by God's providence?
[time=1552] And we talked about a number of things.
[time=1554] We said that natural events are affected by the providence of God.
[time=1557] World events are affected by the providence of God.
[time=1561] Even small, seemingly insignificant events are affected by the providence of God.
[time=1567] Personal experiences and events are affected by God's providence.
[time=1571] In fact, all things are affected by the providence of God.
[time=1576] God controls all things, bringing everything to its proper goal.
[time=1581] And we talked a little bit about the question, if God's providence covers all areas, what about the problem of evil?
[time=1588] What about this difficulty of badness in the world?
[time=1591] Does God's providence mean that he even ordained that those things be?
[time=1595] And it's a tough question.
[time=1596] We talked about that last week.
[time=1598] These things we know for sure, these things that we have confidence in.
[time=1602] God does not do evil.
[time=1604] God does not direct us to do evil.
[time=1607] But at the same time, we have an assurance that in God's providence, evil, even evil, is governed by his sovereignty.
[time=1616] He uses evil to accomplish his ultimate good.
[time=1619] And I don't understand how all of that takes place, but I know it's true.
[time=1622] And we looked at the example of Joseph.
[time=1624] We looked at the example of the hardening of Pharaoh's heart.
[time=1627] We looked at the example of the cross.
[time=1629] And if you would, I'd like you to turn to the fourth chapter of Acts, as we just remember, being reminded that God does use badness.
[time=1637] God uses evil.
[time=1639] God uses wrongdoing to accomplish his good.
[time=1642] That's the providence of God, to bring those things about.
[time=1645] And we see it in the example of the cross.
[time=1647] And here we have the believers praying in Acts chapter four.
[time=1651] And I want you to notice a particular part of their prayer.
[time=1655] Acts chapter four, beginning with verse 27.
[time=1659] It says, "Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together
[time=1665] "with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city "to conspire against your holy servant, Jesus, "whom you anointed." Now, it was the conspiracies that took place here.
[time=1675] Were these things good?
[time=1678] Were they morally right?
[time=1681] No.
[time=1683] Yet here's an example of how God uses something that is bad, that is evil, to accomplish his good.
[time=1688] Because see what happens in the next verse, see what they say in their prayer.
[time=1691] It says that they did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
[time=1698] Even the death of the cross, especially the death of the cross, fit within the providence of God.
[time=1706] It's true that in our life we may not understand all the hows and the whys of why things happen.
[time=1712] When events come to place, we don't have God's sight into all of that, but we can have this confidence.
[time=1719] But the things that come to pass, even the bad things that come to pass work towards God's good purpose.
[time=1728] Why should we be concerned about God's providence?
[time=1732] Well, to the person who has a love relationship with God, to those of us who are Christians, God's providence is our comfort.
[time=1743] Because it's only a provident God who can say that all things work together for good, for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=1754] When we began this last week, I didn't, the series last Sunday, I didn't know that this week would be the kind of week that it's been for my family.
[time=1763] And our seventh month old daughter, Aliyah, this past week, this past Tuesday afternoon, went into seizures, her fever went up, and just had all kinds of complications during the night Tuesday.
[time=1780] And we thought for sure that Tuesday was gonna be the night that she died.
[time=1784] Now, she has rallied back and forth during this whole week.
[time=1788] It just amazes me.
[time=1789] Here's this little baby in an oxygen tent in our living room, and she just comes back.
[time=1794] She may outlive us all.
[time=1797] I don't know, but I doubt it.
[time=1800] But I think this last week, especially of Tuesday night, of just pacing all Tuesday night, wondering when the end was gonna come, and holding this little baby that wasn't pink anymore.
[time=1812] She was kind of ashen, and she was burning with fever and restless, and seemed like she was in so much pain.
[time=1819] And as a parent, the way that that affects you, some of you know how you feel when a child goes through that.
[time=1829] And that hurt, and we cried a lot Tuesday night.
[time=1833] And I remember holding a Lee and walking back and forth, and just over and over saying, knowing that she didn't understand, but from my benefit as well, just saying over and over again, it's gonna be better soon.
[time=1847] It's gonna be better soon.
[time=1852] See, I can say that with every confidence.
[time=1854] But if the Lee dies today, it's gonna be better soon.
[time=1859] 'Cause God's a God of providence.
[time=1861] I'm sure I'm not the first father, and the last father who will say those words.
[time=1868] And I know a heavenly father that I'm sure many times throughout the course of human history has looked down and said it's gonna be better soon.
[time=1876] I'm sure as you look down on Joseph, and saw the trials that Joseph was going through, and the frustrations that must have been in Joseph's life, I'm sure God was saying, it's all right, it's gonna be better soon.
[time=1888] And as the disciples sat in a room, frustrated and worried and fearful because this master and teacher and lord that they'd followed for three years was now gone, he was dead.
[time=1899] I wonder about the ministry of God's spirit in their hearts, assuring them, it's gonna be better soon.
[time=1905] And that's what we wanna think.
[time=1908] That's what we wanna believe that soon that's going to be better, and God gives that promise.
[time=1913] We need to know that our soon isn't always God soon.
[time=1916] Our soon, we want it to be tomorrow.
[time=1917] We want it to be now.
[time=1919] We want it to be better in what we can see in the short term.
[time=1924] It's not always that way.
[time=1926] Hebrews, chapter 11 tells about the great men and women of faith, and it says that these men and women suffered great things, it says their bodies were torn apart, they were tortured, all for the sake of what God had promised them.
[time=1937] And yet it goes on to say that in their lifetime, they never realized the promise of God.
[time=1942] They never realized it.
[time=1945] Yet at the end of chapter 11, Hebrews, it says that these things were accomplished so that God could bring about a greater good.
[time=1951] And even in their life, the Father was looking down and saying it's gonna be better soon.
[time=1956] And when John stands before the throne of God in his revelation, he hears the souls of those who have been tortured and killed for the sake of Jesus Christ crying out and saying, when will our blood be avenged?
[time=1969] How long will this go on?
[time=1970] And God says, in a while, it'll be a while.
[time=1976] Just a little longer.
[time=1977] And the Father says, it's gonna be better soon.
[time=1982] See, that's what the providence of God can mean in our life.
[time=1986] It's what it should mean, our comfort.
[time=1989] Well, today I wanted to discuss another aspect of God's providence and how it relates to us, and that's the question of how do we understand God's will?
[time=1998] How do we understand God's will?
[time=2002] And again, wanna look at three questions.
[time=2004] What is God's providential will?
[time=2005] What is God's moral will and what is God's will for me?
[time=2008] Because sometimes when we talk about this question of God's will, and almost every question is concerned about what is God's will for me.
[time=2017] But when we talk about it, we need to realize that there is a distinction, there is a difference.
[time=2020] When we talk about some of the different ways the Bible refers to the will of God.
[time=2025] And if we don't see a difference, many times will be confused and maybe be led to wrong conclusions.
[time=2030] What is God's providential will?
[time=2033] We've been talking about providence so we don't need to spend a lot of time on this.
[time=2036] But when we talk about the providential will of God, we're talking about God's hidden plan that determines everything that will happen in the universe.
[time=2046] God's hidden plan that will determine everything that will happen in the universe.
[time=2050] Now let's look at that definition and just notice some things about it.
[time=2053] First of all, it's God's hidden plan.
[time=2056] God's providential will is confidential, it's hidden.
[time=2061] I can't know it, you can't know it.
[time=2063] The only way that we can know what God in his providence has ordained for the universe is that if he in some extraordinary or supernatural way reveals that to us.
[time=2074] Deuteronomy 29 says the secret things belong to the Lord.
[time=2080] And Romans 11, it says, who can map out?
[time=2084] Who can trace out God's paths?
[time=2086] We don't know.
[time=2089] Most things are secret to us.
[time=2091] We don't know what is providential will is until something happens.
[time=2094] And when something happens, we can say with every assurance somehow that fits within the providential will of God.
[time=2101] Not only is it confidential, but it is complete.
[time=2104] It's God's hidden plan that determines everything.
[time=2106] There's nothing that is outside the scope of God's providential will.
[time=2110] Ephesians 11, it says, in Jesus Christ,
[time=2116] we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him.
[time=2119] Now listen how it describes God.
[time=2121] According to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will.
[time=2127] God doesn't work out some things.
[time=2128] God doesn't even work out most things.
[time=2131] God works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will.
[time=2135] It's confidential.
[time=2137] It's complete.
[time=2138] Not only that, but it's his hidden plan which determines everything that will happen in the universe, it's certain.
[time=2147] It's gonna happen.
[time=2148] If God in his providence has decreed that something will come to pass, it's going to happen.
[time=2154] And Isaiah chapter 14, it tells us this of God.
[time=2160] It says that this is the plan determined for the whole world.
[time=2163] This is the hand stretched out over the nations.
[time=2165] For the Lord almighty has purposed and who can thwart him, his hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back, it's certain.
[time=2174] Gary Friesen in his book, "Decision Making in the Will of God" has a chart that really helps to see the distinction, this distinction, as we describe and define these aspects of God's will.
[time=2186] And I would like you to imagine this morning since you don't have that chart in front of you, I just want you to represent in your mind the providential will of God by a large circle up here on the stage.
[time=2197] And this circle, we'll go from the end of the stage about two thirds of the way of the cross till about here, just a huge circle.
[time=2204] And in this circle, everything contained in the providential will of God, everything that has happened in the universe and times past, everything that is happening now, everything that God decrees will happen in the future is contained within the scope of God's providential will.
[time=2221] Now we look at God's providential will, and sometimes if we're not careful, we can come to wrong conclusions, and we can be led astray, we can come to the feeling of, well if God is a sovereign God who has his providential will and everything he's decreed will come to place, well then why should I bother with being too concerned about making decisions?
[time=2243] Because no matter what I do, it's what God ordained already.
[time=2246] It's what he's decided is going to happen anyway, so I don't need to be too concerned about it.
[time=2250] We take kind of a fatalistic approach to things.
[time=2253] Or it can become an excuse for us to make dumb decisions.
[time=2259] You know we do something that's totally, don't see too many small children here, stupid.
[time=2265] And then we say, well you know somehow in all of this, it's in God's providential will, and that's true, but that's no excuse for dumb decisions, that's no excuse for doing things that are unwise or even wrong.
[time=2281] So we need to be sure that we keep this in focus, God's providential will.
[time=2289] We need to realize that his providence doesn't release us from responsibility as we exercise our freedom and our wills, because these things work together, it's a doctor and it's a study that's called concurrence.
[time=2301] As God exercises his will and his providence and somehow the will of man is in control and under the direction of God's providence, and yet we have responsibility in exercising our freedom and our choices.
[time=2312] So just keep this big circle in mind behind me, all right?
[time=2318] Providential will of God, and let's talk about the next aspect, what is God's moral will?
[time=2322] When we talk about God's moral will, we're talking about those things that God declares as being good or bad, being right and wrong, being righteous and evil, light, darkness, however you wanna describe it, that's God's moral will.
[time=2337] And God has told us what is moral will is, you don't have to wonder what God's moral will for your life is, God has given you everything you need to know in this book.
[time=2348] He's told us what he wants of us.
[time=2350] Second Timothy tells us that all scripture's given to us, is God breathed and given to us, it is profitable to us, it's useful to us, it's good for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training and righteousness, and it says that we can be fully equipped for every good work through this book, the scripture of God.
[time=2371] We don't have to wonder about what God's moral will is, he's told us what it is.
[time=2376] We need to understand too that obedience in our life brings about successful living.
[time=2381] Obedience to this word results in successful living.
[time=2384] Obedience, you want success in life?
[time=2388] You're concerned about doing God's will, then obey this?
[time=2391] All these people come to me and say, I wanna know God's will, how do I know God's will about where I should go to school, who I should marry?
[time=2397] And it just astounds me, and how many people are concerned about these big issues of life when through the daily pattern of their lives, they show very little concern being obedient to the things that God has told us.
[time=2407] And I suggest to you that God is more concerned about our character and obedience in everyday living than he is in the big decisions of our life.
[time=2416] God told Joshua, he said, don't let this book of the law depart from your mouth, meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful, do everything that's written in it, then you will be prosperous and successful.
[time=2430] And it says in Psalm one that the person who obeys and follows this word of God is like a tree planted by water, whatever he does, prospers.
[time=2441] Successful living comes through obedience of this word.
[time=2444] Now I wanna give you another circle.
[time=2448] Put it on this side.
[time=2449] It's another big circle and it stretches from that into the stage about two thirds this way.
[time=2453] And it's a big circle and within this circle is everything that fits within the moral will of God.
[time=2457] Everything that God says is right and good and proper and righteous.
[time=2461] And if you'll notice these two circles about the place I'm standing now, they overlap.
[time=2466] There's a commonness.
[time=2468] And you need to realize that in the course of the history of the universe and the future of the universe there are things within God's providential will that fall outside of his moral will.
[time=2478] There are things that God says morally are wrong and yet somehow they fit within his providential will.
[time=2484] And you need to realize too that there are things that are morally right fit within his moral will that never come to pass.
[time=2489] They're outside of his providential will.
[time=2491] And there's this area in between that is commonness.
[time=2493] Now help us understand, let me just make some statements.
[time=2495] Let's go back to our illustration, our story of Joseph in the Old Testament.
[time=2500] Let me make some statements.
[time=2501] You're probably familiar with the story of his life.
[time=2504] Let me say some things about it.
[time=2505] And you try to guess where would these statements fit in these different areas?
[time=2512] For instance, I say to you, Joseph's brothers became jealous of him and sold him as a slave.
[time=2518] Now where would that event, where would we place this on the grid here?
[time=2525] The jealousy of Joseph's brother and they're selling him into slavery, was that within the moral will of God?
[time=2533] No, was it within the providential sovereign will of God?
[time=2538] Yes, Joseph said later on to his brothers, you know what you intended for wrong, God intended for good.
[time=2544] So it's outside of this circle, but it's over here in the providential will of God.
[time=2548] It would be over in this area exclusively within the providential will of God.
[time=2553] Another statement.
[time=2553] Joseph's brothers repented of their wrong doing immediately and turned back to God.
[time=2559] Now where would we put that?
[time=2561] Were that fit within the moral will of God?
[time=2564] For them to repent of their wrong doing, yes.
[time=2567] Was it within the providential will of God?
[time=2569] Did it happen?
[time=2570] No, we would place that event over here somewhere.
[time=2574] It never happened.
[time=2574] If it did happen, God would have been pleased with it.
[time=2577] It would have been morally right, but it never came to pass.
[time=2580] Let me give you another statement.
[time=2583] Joseph was faithful in his servant, in his service to his Egyptian master Potiphar.
[time=2588] Joseph was a faithful servant to his Egyptian master Potiphar.
[time=2594] Was that within the moral will of God that Joseph be faithful in what he was doing?
[time=2597] Yes, definitely.
[time=2598] Did it happen?
[time=2599] Yes, it did.
[time=2601] That's something that comes within the commonness of his providential will and his moral will.
[time=2605] Do you see the difference here?
[time=2607] One more.
[time=2608] Joseph gave in to the seductions of Potiphar's wife.
[time=2612] Joseph gave in to the, where would that fit?
[time=2616] Would have been within God's moral will?
[time=2617] No.
[time=2618] Did it happen?
[time=2619] Was it within his providential will?
[time=2620] No, we would place that somewhere outside of the sphere of both circles.
[time=2624] It's something with outside of God's moral will that never came to pass.
[time=2627] And so you see the difference as we look at making decisions, where are we supposed to look?
[time=2632] Where are we supposed to look to when it comes to how I make decisions for my own life?
[time=2638] Yes.
[time=2639] This question of what is God's will for me is important for us to understand.
[time=2646] And one reason it's important for us to understand is because I believe there's so many misconceptions concerning God's will for our life.
[time=2654] And I'd like to mention just a few of them.
[time=2658] And start off with one that's rather important.
[time=2663] You read a lot of books.
[time=2664] You hear a lot of teaching regarding God's will.
[time=2666] This often comes out at least this idea.
[time=2669] And that's what I believe to be a misconception that God has a blueprint for your life that you must first of all discover and then follow.
[time=2679] God's got this hidden plan, this blueprint.
[time=2682] And as you come to decisions of your life, you need to discover whether that fits God's blueprint and then decide if you are going to follow it or not.
[time=2689] And if you follow God's blueprint and the decisions of your life, then you will know the perfect will of God in your life.
[time=2695] And if you get away from the path, if you get off the blueprint, if you fail to follow it, then it may mean that you have to accept God's second best for your life, his permissive will, maybe his third best for your life.
[time=2706] I have problems with this blueprint view of God's view for a number of reasons.
[time=2713] First of all, consistency is impossible.
[time=2718] If you really believe that God has a blueprint for your life that governs the decisions of your life, where do you draw the line when you stop asking God is this decision you want me to make or not?
[time=2728] I mean, most of us would agree, God must be concerned about who we marry, where we go to school, what kind of vocation we have.
[time=2733] Those are important things.
[time=2734] We need to go to God and seek his will.
[time=2736] But what about things that are a little dropped down the list from that?
[time=2739] Is God concerned about where I live?
[time=2742] Is God concerned about the church I attend?
[time=2744] Yeah, well, that's important too.
[time=2746] If that fits the blueprint, okay, does it, is important whether I go to church on a particular Sunday?
[time=2753] Yeah, is it important what clothes I wear to church on that Sunday?
[time=2757] Well, isn't it important what color socks I wear to church that's?
[time=2762] No, come on, you're getting re-- is it important which sock I put on first in the morning?
[time=2767] Now, you're being absurd now.
[time=2769] I mean, of course, God, I want you to understand if you are consistent in the belief that God has a blueprint, then where do you draw the line of what decisions are important to be concerned about and what are not?
[time=2781] And if you're consistent, let me suggest that every decision is an important decision.
[time=2784] It's not just the big things we can get off base on.
[time=2786] It's the little things too.
[time=2787] It's the little sins that can get us off course.
[time=2790] And some people who take this view of God's will realize the need for consistency and become so overwhelmed with it that they will not allow themselves to do anything without first consulting God.
[time=2801] True, there's a woman not too long ago.
[time=2806] The story was told about her.
[time=2807] She was so spiritually oriented that before she would get out of bed in the morning she would pray and ask God, what side of the bed?
[time=2815] She should get out.
[time=2817] And before she'd get dressed, she'd ask God, what should I wear today and what shoe should I put on first?
[time=2823] I don't know about you, drive me nuts.
[time=2824] Can't be consistent.
[time=2830] Another reason I have a problem with this view is that my chances for success might be ruined by someone else's disobedience.
[time=2835] I mean, I understand that my disobedience might get me away from the blueprint, might ruin my chances for being within the perfect world of God.
[time=2843] But I also realize that maybe someone else is gonna mess up my life.
[time=2847] This used to frustrate me.
[time=2849] I worry me when I came to thinking about who I was gonna eventually marry.
[time=2852] And people would tell me often, you know, God's got that one special one picked out for you and you just need to make sure that you find her.
[time=2860] And you need to make sure that you're living obedience to God and you're making the right choices because if you don't marry that particular one you're gonna be accepting God's second best for your life.
[time=2871] Well, I didn't want God's second best.
[time=2873] I want it his best.
[time=2874] But I thought if it's possible for me to mess up and have to re-resign to God's second best in my marriage, what if I'm doing everything right and my wife to be is out there messing up?
[time=2886] What does she marry somebody else?
[time=2888] Then where does that leave me?
[time=2890] I'm stuck.
[time=2891] And I just don't think God works quite that way.
[time=2897] Another reason I'm bothered by it is that results in the second best mentality we've been talking about that somehow if I get off track I've gotta accept God's second best in his will for my life.
[time=2908] I just, you know, this causes us to focus on the big sins of our life and what I really think it does is diminishes the grace of God.
[time=2916] Because what God's grace says is that despite our failures and our weaknesses and our sometimes great sin God can work to achieve great things in our life still.
[time=2925] And you look through the characters of the Bible and you see that God, those that God used most were oftentimes those that had the largest failures in their life, David.
[time=2935] God told David, "Don't you number the people of Israel?" And David did it anyway.
[time=2939] And David committed adultery with Bashib and then went on ahead to make plans that would result in the murder of her husband on the battlefield.
[time=2946] If anybody would accept God's second best in their life, it would be David.
[time=2950] And I acknowledge that David did suffer consequences for a sin.
[time=2954] But he was still one mightily used of God who God says that he was a man after God's own heart.
[time=2960] Let's not get the idea that boy, if I messed up,
[time=2966] somehow God can't work through that.
[time=2968] God's grace is bigger than our sin.
[time=2970] One other thing I'll say, one of the reason that this blueprint view bothers me a little bit is, you know, God just doesn't promise that he's gonna reveal his will in every decision of our life.
[time=2982] Now, I know we'd like to look at verses and we go to verses in the description.
[time=2985] We don't have time to go all, to all those verses that people sometimes use.
[time=2989] And we say, well, see, God promises that he will direct in the decisions of our life.
[time=2992] I just wanna suggest to you that those verses are usually just taken out of context or use wrong, I believe, in when we teach that God directs the decisions of our life.
[time=3000] Let me just mention one, for example, 'cause it's oftentimes used in Isaiah chapter 30.
[time=3004] Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you saying, "This is the way, walk in it." And we get the idea that as Christians, we walk along the course of our life somehow there's this voice that directs us and helps us understand, this is the way you should go.
[time=3019] This is the way you should turn.
[time=3020] That's not what Isaiah is saying.
[time=3022] You read that passage.
[time=3023] And God is saying that he's gonna raise up teachers and prophets to teach and lead the people.
[time=3030] It's not this quiet, mystical voice of God that's somehow directing every individual in the particular decisions of their life.
[time=3038] It's those teachers that would guide them in the moral rightness of obedience to God.
[time=3043] So I think we misuse scripture.
[time=3044] And so many times we do look at those instances in the Bible where God did give specific direction and choices of life and it happens over and over again in the Bible.
[time=3052] We see that God did specifically give direction and we say, "Well, that must be what God wants to do to me too." But we need to realize that those are the exceptions.
[time=3060] God never says that's the norm of how he deals in our life and helping us make decisions.
[time=3064] And when it happened, it happened in an extraordinary or supernatural way.
[time=3068] And God never promises that those things will happen in our life.
[time=3073] Well, that's one misconception.
[time=3074] Just quickly, I mentioned some others.
[time=3076] I think a misconception regards to God's will as the inner promptings reveal his will in our life.
[time=3082] You know how many people say, "Well, God told me.
[time=3084] "God led me to do this." And please don't get me wrong.
[time=3088] I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3089] I believe God can nudge and God can prompt and do all those things.
[time=3092] But I think that most of the time, when we use that phrase, "God told me to do this," we misuse it.
[time=3097] And we think these inner promptings must be from God.
[time=3101] And when someone else says that God has told them to do this, we think, "Well, what can we say to that?" If God told them, "How can we dispute it?
[time=3109] "How can we argue with it?" And I've had a young man that came to me a few years back in the ministry.
[time=3116] He said, "You know, God's leading me in to be a pastor." And here's someone who had difficulty expressing loved other people, was not too gifted in teaching and not even that consistent in living out obedience to God in their everyday life.
[time=3132] And yet God's telling them they ought to be a pastor.
[time=3135] This person had about as much tactfulness as a porcupine and a balloon factory, and they're going to go out and shepherd the flock.
[time=3141] And I thought, "Really, God's leading you.
[time=3143] "How do you know that?" "Well, God just let me know, He's told me." You know, I sense it.
[time=3149] And that's about when I was being questioning the kind of pizza they had to eat the night before because I really think sometimes these inner promptings may have other causes besides God telling us, "What He wants us to do?" I mean, we let our emotions get away with us and I don't know about you, but I have promptings all the time.
[time=3168] And almost always, it's, you know, nothing happens as a result of them.
[time=3172] Oh, but if it does, boy, I've got a good testimony.
[time=3175] Yes, I just sense that God wanted me to do this certain thing and lo and behold, and I'm not trying to diminish again the work of God of the Spirit.
[time=3181] I just want you to realize that most of the time we feel those things that does not guarantee.
[time=3185] In fact, you know, Moses said of the people of Israel that they were under no obligation to follow the words of the prophets unless the things that the prophets prophesied came to pass.
[time=3195] Now, if that's true of a prophet, then certainly it's true of the person that comes to you and says, you know, God told me to do this and I want you to help me and support me in it.
[time=3203] Listen, if you want to help and support someone who says God told them to do something, do it because you think it's biblically right and spiritually wise.
[time=3210] Don't do it because you're obligated by God's directive.
[time=3215] Another misconception, outward signs reveal God's will.
[time=3219] You know, we think of Gideon and the fleece and you need to realize again, Gideon, that was an exception.
[time=3224] The angel of the Lord had already come to Gideon and told him face to face what he wanted him to do.
[time=3228] And Gideon, it was not an act of faith, it was an act of doubt that Gideon laid this fleece out, this proof of what God wanted him to do.
[time=3235] Well, we get the idea, well, you know, I look for outward signs as evidence that this is really what God wants.
[time=3240] You know, God, if this is really what you want, I'm gonna flip this penny three times, it comes up heads every time and I know it's your will.
[time=3246] Okay, well, four times, it comes up a fourth time, God.
[time=3248] I really know, and you know, we play games with God and we look for evidence.
[time=3251] Oh, sometimes we just abuse this so much.
[time=3253] I had a couple in my youth group in Michigan a number of years ago.
[time=3258] And after all the times that we had spent talking about what God wants in a relationship and what honors God in a relationship, especially when it comes to facing sexual pressures, they have the audacity to come and say, you know, we sat in our car one night and we just loved each other so much.
[time=3273] We wanted to express ourselves completely, physically, sexually with each other.
[time=3277] And so we prayed about it.
[time=3280] And we asked God, God, would this be your will for us?
[time=3284] And we looked up and there as the sun was setting and the sky was a rainbow.
[time=3290] That was it.
[time=3295] Must be okay if the rainbow is in the sky, you know?
[time=3300] And again, God can use outward signs and things to reveal His will, but I just, I want you to understand that that's not, that's the exception.
[time=3309] That's not the rule.
[time=3310] We need to be careful.
[time=3312] Another misconception, open doors indicate God's will.
[time=3315] I'd suggest that Satan can open doors too.
[time=3318] And sometimes there are closed doors that God wants you to kick open.
[time=3322] And there are times when there are open doors that God does not want you to go through.
[time=3324] That was true of Paul when God opened the door to Troaz and Paul chose not to go that way.
[time=3329] And that was perfectly within the will of God for him to do that.
[time=3332] Final misconception is inner peace indicates that I'm following God's will.
[time=3335] Isn't this a big one for us?
[time=3337] We think if I feel right about it, that indicates that it's okay with God.
[time=3341] I want to tell you, when I moved to Fort Wayne two years ago from nine and a half years of ministry in Michigan, for the first two months of my being here, I did not have inner peace about being here.
[time=3351] I had a lot of turmoil.
[time=3352] I went home almost every day.
[time=3353] And my daughter went to my wife one afternoon and says, why does Papa come home and just stare out the window when work is over?
[time=3362] Man, I was discouraged and I was depressed.
[time=3365] I wanted to be back home with the people that I knew.
[time=3367] I didn't have inner peace, but you know what?
[time=3369] I was convinced and I still am convinced that it was the right time and it was the right move.
[time=3374] But I didn't always feel that inner peace about it.
[time=3376] And sometimes we feel peace about things we shouldn't feel peace about.
[time=3380] Alan Peterson, who does a lot of counseling, says in his book, The Myth of the Greener Grass, talks about a man who comes in and describes to him an affair that he was having.
[time=3390] And he goes on to describe, he says, you know, things weren't working out in my marriage and I came to church and I started spending time with this woman who had been divorced in the church.
[time=3399] We spent time together.
[time=3399] You know, things just clicked.
[time=3401] And pretty soon we were involved.
[time=3404] Pretty soon we were physically involved.
[time=3406] And I struggled with the love and the guilt and I said, I prayed to God, I said, God, if this is wrong, take these feelings away from me.
[time=3413] You know what, God didn't take the feelings away.
[time=3414] So, God must want it to happen.
[time=3416] How do we know God's will?
[time=3422] How do we know God's will for our life?
[time=3426] Most importantly, God wants us to live within his moral will.
[time=3433] We have got to be obedient to this book.
[time=3437] He will never ask you to do anything that is outside of his moral will.
[time=3442] Most importantly, there's one thing that you must do to follow God's will, to follow his directive.
[time=3449] Know this book?
[time=3452] Live by it, do it.
[time=3456] 'Cause when those things are true, when those things are accomplished in your life, God will bless you.
[time=3463] And you will be living within the will of God.
