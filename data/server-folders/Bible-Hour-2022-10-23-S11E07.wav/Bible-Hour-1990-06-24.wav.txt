[time=61] Is there a secret for the successful Christian life?
[time=64] Hudson Taylor thought there was.
[time=68] As a matter of fact, in the book about Hudson Taylor, called Hudson Taylor's Spiritual Secret, a chapter entitled The Exchange Life, Hudson Taylor gives the secret of success that turned his life around.
[time=83] I've been dealing with that subject this morning.

[time=760] - Thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour today.
[time=764] I'm very excited about an event that's coming up and I want you to mark your calendar now so that you'll be with us on July 1st.
[time=772] That's our annual patriotic panorama.
[time=774] It'll be called I Believe in America and begins at four o'clock in the afternoon on July 1st.
[time=781] Our special guest that day is Gary McSpadden and Gary is a former member of the Gaither Vocal Band, an outstanding soloist and he will really contribute to that program.
[time=792] Our sanctuary choir and soloist will be singing also.
[time=795] So I encourage you to mark that date, plan ahead now to join with us on July 1st at 4 p.m.
[time=802] for our annual patriotic panorama, I Believe in America.
[time=807] On next week's program, we will be having a special guest.
[time=809] His name is Dr. David Drolinger.
[time=812] Dr. Drolinger is a friend of mine from the West Coast who has just recently relocated in the Midwest at Cedarville College in Cedarville, Ohio.
[time=821] He's professor of Bible there and you will enjoy his speaking to us next week on our program.
[time=827] Last week I read from a booklet entitled Reflections Inverse by Dr. Charles Wagner.
[time=834] We made that booklet available to you and it's available again today and I hope that you'll take the moment to write down the address and ask for this wonderful booklet.
[time=844] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=854] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=864] And as we mentioned the booklet, I have the special privilege today of having with me in the studio, Dr. Charles Wagner.
[time=872] Good morning, Dr. Wagner.
[time=874] - Good morning, great to be here.
[time=875] - Our acquaintance goes back a number of years ago when you were passed her out in Washington and I was in music at Los Angeles Baptist College and we had the privilege of being at your church a number of times with groups and that was always a delightful time to be in Tacoma, Washington with you.
[time=892] - Well, it was good to have you there.
[time=893] You were much younger, a few years.
[time=895] - You know, years do kind of creep up on us, don't they?
[time=898] - Yeah, indeed.
[time=899] - You now are not in Washington but you are also in the Midwest and you are president of Grand Rapids Baptist College in seminary.
[time=906] Tell us a little bit about the school, Dr. Wagner.
[time=908] - The college is a Christian liberal arts college, a college of arts and sciences and the seminary of course is a graduate school training men and women for the pastorate and for the mission field.
[time=920] And it's in Grand Rapids, a delightful place to be and God is blessing.
[time=925] - We had a wonderful time not too many months ago by taking a group up from Black Hawk and singing in your chapel and I have to tell you that I love our work here but I also just have a little tinge when I see all of those young people and the excitement that's generated there and it looks like a wonderful place in which to minister and work.
[time=945] - Well, it's a challenge because these young people are preparing, many of whom are preparing for the ministry but many are lay people who will prepare to be full-time Christians and who will serve the Lord in various fields of the arts and sciences down through the years and the future and we're encouraged.
[time=966] - We can really relate to that, Dr. Wagner because of having the local church here we count on a great deal of number of men who are in secular jobs but really are dedicated to serving the Lord here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=980] In fact, many of them are right behind cameras today, all lay people who give of their time to present to you the Bible hour.
[time=988] One more book that I'd like to offer, we mentioned it last week, it's called Winning Words for Daily Living and I mentioned to you that Dr. Wagner is the author of this book and it's a rather recent book and what is the content of the book?
[time=1002] - Well, Pete, the book is a devotional book published by Krigel and Winning Words for Daily Living is based on Isaiah 4031.
[time=1012] They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint and actually there are four parts to the verse.
[time=1023] They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength, the first part is strength for growing.
[time=1028] They shall mount up with wings as eagles, that's truths for soaring.
[time=1032] They shall run and not be weary, training for running and they shall walk and not faint, it's light for walking.
[time=1039] And it's a devotional book, really.
[time=1042] Primarily of things that I've done in years gone by for the radio and it's a compilation of those and I hope you'll enjoy it.
[time=1052] - Well, I've begun to read it and again, we'd like to make it available to you.
[time=1056] This book you can receive by writing to the Bible hour and sending us $15 or more.
[time=1062] The booklet can be received by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East state, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1073] This is daily devotions that will change your life.
[time=1076] I'm confident of that.
[time=1078] I'd like to give you that address one more time.
[time=1081] That's the Bible hour, 7,400 East state, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1089] Dr. Wagner, it's a delight to have you here today and we look forward to hearing Dr. Wagner in our service as he preaches to us and for the Bible hour today.
[time=1098] God bless you as you continue to watch the Bible hour.
[time=1100] (gentle music)
[time=1109] [MUSIC - 192 seconds]
[time=1305] - Music can be such an encouragement.
[time=1318] Thank you very much, Starr, for the words of that song.
[time=1321] There are people in our congregation right now that need to be held up by the almighty hand of God because of illness, even death in their families, whether you know specifically of the needs.
[time=1333] I hope that you're faithful and just praying for all the families of Black Hawk Baptist Church and encouraging them, as you hear, of instances where they really need our support.
[time=1343] And that is true in the lives of many of our people today and we have prayed for them throughout this week.
[time=1349] It's my privilege today to introduce to you, Dr. Charles Wagner.
[time=1352] He's the president of Grand Rapids Baptist College in Seminary.
[time=1356] I've known him for a number of years as he was on the West Coast when I was out there and I had the privilege of bringing corals and singing groups to his church in Tacoma, Washington.
[time=1366] He's been a great speaker and a great support to Christian education as he was a member of the board for a number of years at Los Angeles Baptist College.
[time=1375] He was the president of Northwest Seminary and now is ministering at Grand Rapids Baptist College.
[time=1380] It's just a delight to introduce him to our family.
[time=1383] Please welcome Dr. Charles Wagner to our pulpit.
[time=1386] [ Applause ]
[time=1393] >> Thank you, Peter.
[time=1395] I remember Pete when he had black hair.
[time=1398] [ Laughter ] And he remembers me when I had hair.
[time=1403] [ Laughter ] And it's a delight to be here.
[time=1407] I'm reading this morning from the fourth chapter of Philippians.
[time=1412] Will you turn with me, please, to the epistle, which Guy King called "The Joy Way." And he called it that because this is the epistle of rejoicing.
[time=1423] It's a very positive epistle.
[time=1426] You might not expect that from a man who wrote it in prison, one of Paul's prison epistles, which goes to show that our joy does not depend
[time=1437] on externalities upon environmental surroundings but upon the indwelling Christ.
[time=1445] And in Philippians chapter 4, we have some of the most quoted verses in the Bible.
[time=1451] I dare say that outside of John 3, 16 and maybe the 23rd Psalm,
[time=1457] the verses most often quoted in the Bible include these.
[time=1461] Philippians 4, beginning with verse 6, "Be careful for nothing."
[time=1468] That means don't worry about anything.
[time=1471] But in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God.
[time=1479] That is, pray about everything, be thankful for anything.
[time=1482] And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
[time=1489] Many a weary head has found a pillow on these verses.
[time=1494] Don't worry, just pray and thank God and surround yourself with an awareness
[time=1503] that His peace is there to sustain us and garrison us.
[time=1508] However, verse 5 is the verse I would have us consider this morning.
[time=1512] We don't genuinely quote 5, 6 and 7, generally 6 and 7.
[time=1517] Like who knows John 3, John 3, 15?
[time=1522] Or who quotes Psalm 22? Or who quotes John 1, 11?
[time=1526] But verse 5, I think, is very important to this paragraph.
[time=1531] I'll go so far as to say that unless you have verse 5, you can apply verses 6 and 7.
[time=1538] So let's look at the fifth verse.
[time=1540] Let your moderation be known unto all men.
[time=1544] The Lord is at hand.
[time=1548] Now, if we have that premise, that verse, only then can we say,
[time=1554] don't worry about anything, pray about everything, be thankful for anything and know His peace.
[time=1561] That's how important verse 5 is.
[time=1563] Look at it again with me, let your moderation be known unto all men.
[time=1568] The word moderation here is one of the most untranslatable words in the Greek New Testament.
[time=1576] That's why it's translated so many different ways.
[time=1579] Let your moderation, let your gentleness be known.
[time=1583] Let your sweet reasonableness be known unto all men.
[time=1586] That's the idea.
[time=1588] Let your flexibility be known unto all men.
[time=1591] The Lord is at hand.
[time=1594] All of those things are good.
[time=1595] It speaks of that which is not self-seeking.
[time=1599] I am sweet.
[time=1601] I am reasonable.
[time=1602] I am moderate.
[time=1603] I am pliable.
[time=1605] I am flexible.
[time=1606] All of that goes along with that word.
[time=1609] Then He said this, let your moderation be known unto all men.
[time=1613] The Lord is at hand.
[time=1616] Now, what does that mean?
[time=1618] Well, you say the Lord is at hand.
[time=1620] That must mean the Lord is coming.
[time=1623] Well, that's a good thought.
[time=1624] I don't think that's what this means.
[time=1627] I believe He's coming all right.
[time=1629] The Bible teaches that if I go away, I will come again and receive you unto myself.
[time=1634] He's coming.
[time=1635] Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus
[time=1641] Christ, He's coming.
[time=1643] Our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior who shall change our vile bodies, that it might be fashioned like unto His glorious body.
[time=1653] He's coming.
[time=1655] Waiting for His Son from heaven, He's coming, even so come Lord Jesus, He's coming.
[time=1661] But I don't think that's what this particular verse means.
[time=1665] The Lord is at hand, I think simply means this.
[time=1669] The Lord is near.
[time=1671] He's at hand, nearer than hands and feet.
[time=1676] He is with us.
[time=1679] God is with us.
[time=1682] And when you zero in on that and when you are conscious of that and when that becomes a reality to you, then the following verses make sense.
[time=1690] God is with us.
[time=1692] Don't worry about anything.
[time=1694] The anxious for nothing.
[time=1695] God is with us in everything by prayer and supplication.
[time=1699] Pray to Him.
[time=1700] How can you do that?
[time=1701] He's with us.
[time=1703] The peace of God which pass it all understanding shall keep our hearts and minds.
[time=1709] I mean when you know His presence, you know His peace.
[time=1713] The Lord is at hand.
[time=1716] I hope that before the service is over, that little phrase rings loud and clear in your
[time=1722] mind so that when you leave, you'll know what it means.
[time=1726] He is with me.
[time=1727] That's not just a nice little phrase to say, a cliche among Christians.
[time=1733] It's a reality.
[time=1735] Paul said that when he was in prison, he said, "The Lord is at hand." Now what I like to do this morning is to focus your attention on three Old Testament passages
[time=1747] that illustrate that New Testament truth.
[time=1751] So let's begin.
[time=1752] Take our Bibles and turn to Daniel chapter three.
[time=1755] And I'm aware of the fact that most of these verses I'm going to read, you are most familiar
[time=1761] with.
[time=1762] I mean for example Daniel three, remember when you were a child in Sunday school and you heard about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego being cast in the fiery furnace.
[time=1772] It's a well-known story.
[time=1774] But look at it please.
[time=1775] Daniel chapter three verse one, "Never Knesser the king made an image of gold whose height
[time=1782] was three score cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits and he set it in the plain of
[time=1788] Jura on the province of Babylon." Now what happened here was very clear.
[time=1795] Nebuchadnezzar built a golden image and everybody was to bow down to it.
[time=1801] I mean if you wanted to live and survive, you bow down.
[time=1808] Everybody does it.
[time=1809] That's the end thing to do, it's the Vogue thing.
[time=1813] It's the right thing.
[time=1814] It's obeying the law of the land.
[time=1816] He said bow down to the golden image.
[time=1820] There were three young men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and when we were kids we would say Shadrach, Meshach, and to bed we'd call.
[time=1829] Now three young Hebrews who said, "I can't do that because it violates my commitment
[time=1836] to the only true God, Jehovah.
[time=1839] She will not bow down." And I'm sure their friends said now just a minute, "You'll have no ability to witness unless you're alive." So the situation calls to bow down, "Do it, just get it over with.
[time=1852] You can have mental reservations if you please, but bow down." And they said, "No, we'll not do it." And in verse 16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, "Oh, Nebuchadnezzar,
[time=1865] we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
[time=1870] If so be our God whom we serve as able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace,
[time=1876] and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king, ah-ha, but what if he doesn't?
[time=1884] But if not, be it known unto the O king that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the
[time=1891] golden image which I have set up.
[time=1894] We're not going to do it.
[time=1895] No way.
[time=1896] Thumbs down.
[time=1898] Negative." Well, you know what happened.
[time=1902] Nebuchadnezzar commanded that these men be taken and bound and cast into the fiery furnace,
[time=1908] verses 21-22.
[time=1911] And verse 24, Nebuchadnezzar, the king was astounded and rose up in haste and speak and
[time=1920] said unto his consulars, "Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?"
[time=1928] And they answered and said unto the king, "True, O king." He answered and said, "Lo, I see four men, not three, four men, loose, walking in the
[time=1939] midst of the fire, and they have no hurt, and the form of the forth is like the Son
[time=1946] of God." Well, he was the Son of God, we call this a Theophany in the Bible, an appearance of
[time=1953] Christ in his pre-incarnate form, a number of times that happened in the Old Testament.
[time=1959] Walking with these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego was the Lord.
[time=1964] He was in their presence, and they were singing.
[time=1967] So how do you know that?
[time=1968] Didn't say that in the text.
[time=1970] Well, I believe they were, and I'll tell you what I think they were singing.
[time=1974] He goes like this, "The Lord is at hand!" Because he was.
[time=1981] He was with them in the fire.
[time=1984] The Lord is with us.
[time=1988] And may I suggest to you this morning that when you know that he's with you, I mean with
[time=1995] you, when you know God is with you, you can say no to the golden images.
[time=2003] And everybody else is saying, "Yes," and bowing down to them.
[time=2008] That's called Christian commitment and conviction.
[time=2012] We have a lot of golden images today.
[time=2014] People say, "Go ahead and conform.
[time=2018] Just get with it." And the image may be a drug scene, it may be a liquor scene, it may be a promiscuous living.
[time=2028] It could be any compromise.
[time=2031] And everybody does it, so you say that's the thing to do.
[time=2034] But praise God for men and women whose value system is based upon the word of God, and
[time=2040] who will say no to the golden images.
[time=2044] When everybody else is saying, "Yes," and bowing down to them.
[time=2048] May I suggest that that comes to us not because of some innate fortitude which we have, not
[time=2054] because of my stock.
[time=2056] It comes because I know he's with me, and when I'm aware that God is with me.
[time=2063] The Lord is with us when you know God is with you.
[time=2068] You can dare to say no, no to the golden images.
[time=2073] When everybody else is conforming and bowing down.
[time=2079] How will you take your Bibles and turn to the second passage, this time please, the book
[time=2085] of Numbers chapter 13, Numbers 13.
[time=2090] And once again, this is a familiar passage so we can take the known and move into maybe
[time=2096] the unknown.
[time=2097] In Numbers 13, God told Moses at Cateish Barnia to go spy the land out and to see what
[time=2107] it is.
[time=2110] And now he didn't need to do that for God's benefit.
[time=2112] The Lord knew what the land was like, but the Lord wanted them to search the land with
[time=2118] a reconnaissance group and then come back and report.
[time=2121] And in Numbers 13, verse 17, Moses sent them to spy out the land and unto Canaan, and he
[time=2127] said unto them, "Get you up this way, southward and go up into the mountain and see the land
[time=2135] what it is and the people that dwell therein, whether they be strong or weak, fewer, many,
[time=2142] and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad, and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds.
[time=2151] And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein or not, and be of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land."
[time=2162] In other words, look it over when you find the fruit, bring it back, and give us a report about Cateish Barnia.
[time=2170] So they went up, verse 21, and searched the land, and in verse 23 it says, "And they came
[time=2177] unto the brook of Eschol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes,
[time=2184] and they bear it between two upon a staff." Now my dear friend, them's grapes, pardon the English.
[time=2192] I mean that.
[time=2193] Take two men to carry one bunch of grapes.
[time=2198] One of the first mistakes I made when I went to Michigan from Washington State is in a public meeting in our college to brag about the apples of Washington.
[time=2209] That was a no-no.
[time=2210] And I went on and on and talked about the succulent, Macintosh, and the beautiful apples, a little luscious fruit, and Dr. Welch, who was the chancellor of the college, came to me after
[time=2221] the service and said, "Dr. Wagner, we have apples in Michigan, too."
[time=2227] And then every morning for a week I had an apple on my desk.
[time=2231] Are apples, oranges, you name it, nobody grew grapes like this.
[time=2237] Took two men to carry one bunch of grapes, and they're bringing them back to show Moses
[time=2243] and the others the fruit of the land.
[time=2247] Well, in verse 27, it says, "And they told him and said, 'We came unto the land whether
[time=2253] thou sendest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey.
[time=2259] And this is the fruit of it, and they're grapes.'
[time=2265] Nevertheless, oh my, that's a word of unbelief.
[time=2270] The grapes are luscious, however.
[time=2273] I mean, they're fruit of succulent, but I haven't told you the whole story.
[time=2279] Nevertheless, are you ready for this?
[time=2282] The people be strong dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, oh my, and very great,
[time=2289] and moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.
[time=2294] The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south, the Hittites, and the Jubbusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan,
[time=2303] and we can't do it." What about the grapes?
[time=2307] Didn't you hear what I said?
[time=2310] We have a formidable enemy.
[time=2314] And in verse 32, it says, "And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, 'The land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof.' And all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
[time=2334] And there we saw, this is the bottom line, 'We saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which
[time=2342] come of a giants, and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so were we in their sight.'
[time=2350] There were giants there.
[time=2352] Of course there are giants there.
[time=2354] Are you surprised?
[time=2359] Whoever said this Christian life was easy.
[time=2363] If you want to taste the grapes, you've got to face the giants.
[time=2367] No sweat, no sweat, no pain, no gain, no cross, no crown, no giants, no grapes.
[time=2377] And if you want to reach for the grapes and taste them, you've got to be willing to face
[time=2383] the giants." Well, in chapter 14 of Numbers, the next chapter, Caleb and Joshua, who are bringing
[time=2392] a minority report, they approach the people and they say in verse 8, "If the Lord delight
[time=2400] in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it us a land which flows with milk
[time=2406] and honey, only rebellion out against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the land.
[time=2413] Don't worry about the giants, for they are bred for us, the bigger the giants, the bigger the loaf.
[time=2420] I mean, we can do it." It doesn't seem to be arrogant to say you can do it, not when you read the next phrase.
[time=2430] It says, "Their defense is departed from them," here it is, "and the Lord is with us."
[time=2436] That's the difference.
[time=2439] That makes a minority a majority, the Lord is with us.
[time=2444] Fear them not.
[time=2448] May I suggest to you today that if you know that God is with you, you can say no to the
[time=2456] golden images when everybody else is bowing down to them and saying yes.
[time=2462] And if you know God is with you, you can say yes for the grapes and reach for the grapes
[time=2468] when everybody else is looking at the giants.
[time=2471] The difference is His presence.
[time=2476] Now I think we need to be negative sometimes.
[time=2478] I think we need to be negative enough to say no, no way, I won't bow down, but God wants
[time=2484] us to be positive in our Christianity.
[time=2487] He wants us to have faith, faith mighty faith the promises and looks to God alone, laughs
[time=2495] at impossibilities and cries that shall be done, and cries and cries that shall be done,
[time=2504] and cries and cries that shall be done, faith, faith laughs at impossibilities, and laughs
[time=2513] at the giants and cries that shall be done.
[time=2520] That's not cockiness, that's not arrogance, that's not presumption, that's faith.
[time=2525] And it's based upon the fact that God is with us, the Lord is with us.
[time=2534] Now one more passage, will you turn with me please to Psalm 46, the 46th Psalm.
[time=2543] And you know, this is a Psalm that we usually read when people die, it's a shame because
[time=2551] it'd be nice for living people to hear it.
[time=2554] So I'm going to read it here this morning so you can hear it and apply it.
[time=2560] Psalm 46, beautiful Psalm.
[time=2563] Now the Psalms were songs.
[time=2566] And I think in this particular Psalm you have a verse in the chorus, a verse in the chorus,
[time=2575] and let's read the chorus first, all right, that'll help us understand the verse.
[time=2580] Psalm 46 verse 7, the Lord of hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge, Cela.
[time=2590] See what that says, God is with us, drop down to verse 11, same thing.
[time=2596] The Lord of hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge, Cela, you had that same verse
[time=2605] quoted twice, God is with us.
[time=2610] Now when you understand that, the rest of the Psalm makes sense.
[time=2615] Look at verse 1, God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
[time=2626] He's with us.
[time=2630] He's a present help.
[time=2633] He's a present help in trouble; therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed, and
[time=2642] though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, you say that's poetry, it's more than poetry, it's reality, it's an earthquake.
[time=2650] Peter, were you in earthquakes at all when you were out there in California and in Washington
[time=2657] we had earthquakes all the time.
[time=2659] As a matter of fact, I have a good friend John White who was with me in California, holding meetings at Los Angeles Baptist College as a matter of fact, and John White and I got
[time=2670] into a little friendly argument, you know how preachers do this, they get together and they talk and discuss theology and you think we're all nice, but I mean we were getting
[time=2681] at each other there in a nice way, and we differed in something.
[time=2688] And White said to me, "I've written books on that," and I said, "Ho hum," and then it
[time=2696] was just great.
[time=2697] And then we went to bed, he went to his room and I went to mine and God sent earthquakes.
[time=2704] And I said, "Give it to him, Lord." And you know, I don't know whether you've been around with earthquakes, genuinely when I preach a message like this, I illustrate it, but I can't do it very well here.
[time=2716] But an earthquake is, generally there are 15 or 20 little ones, and one comes and the
[time=2723] bed shakes and everything is moving, and then another one comes and it's a little longer and another one, and you're sitting there waiting for the biggie.
[time=2730] So the next morning I said to White, "Well, that'll teach you to argue with me."
[time=2738] But seriously, have you had earthquakes in your life?
[time=2742] I mean, have you had experiences in your life where it felt like the earth was moving?
[time=2748] And you say, "Oh Lord, I didn't plan on this.
[time=2752] I hadn't planned on this reversal, or this death, or this disappointment, or this problem."
[time=2759] And it feels like everything's caving in, and the Psalmist describes there, he said,
[time=2766] "Though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried in the midst of the sea,"
[time=2773] I mean the most stable thing, we know anything about our mountains.
[time=2778] I am from Washington state where we had Mount Rainier, and I had a chalet there on the near the mountain, and I look out at that fixed final stable, unshakeable, unmoveable mountain,
[time=2791] and the Bible says even when your stability is gone, and the thing that seems most stable
[time=2799] has eroded, and you say, "What can I do?"
[time=2806] And the psalmist says, "Here is what you do.
[time=2810] The Lord of hosts is with us.
[time=2816] He's a very present help in trouble." And then later on in this chapter, look at it, please, in verse 10, he said, "Be still and know that I am God," and you say, "How can I be still when the ground is moving?
[time=2835] How can I be still when the mountains are shaking?
[time=2840] How does God expect me to be still?" I could be done in the midst of trauma, in the midst of cataclysmic movements, in the
[time=2852] midst of vicissitudes of life, in the midst of sickness and threat of cancer, in the midst of death.
[time=2859] All of these things can be realized because he is with us.
[time=2865] And when you know that God is with you, are you with me?
[time=2870] When you know God is with you, you can say, "No," to the golden images, when everybody
[time=2876] else is bowing down and saying, "Yes," to them.
[time=2881] You can say, "Yes," to the grapes, and "Reach," for the grapes, when everybody else is looking at the giants.
[time=2888] And you can be still and know that he is God.
[time=2896] When the earth is moved, the mountains are carried into the sea.
[time=2900] See, that's what it means to be a Christian.
[time=2904] You understand that this morning?
[time=2905] There's no Christ as Savior.
[time=2907] It's to know that he is with me.
[time=2910] My father, Charles Wagner, was a monotone.
[time=2917] He couldn't sing.
[time=2918] And I remember when I was in Permany with him back in Hazel Park, Michigan, as a kid, I'd stand by Dad, and my father would sing, but I was always proud of him.
[time=2927] He'd rare back and sing, and he was loud, too.
[time=2930] But I'll never forget, I can almost hear his voice this morning.
[time=2934] He'd sing, "And he walks with me, and he talks with me, and he tells me I am his own,
[time=2944] and the joy we share as we terry there, none other has ever known."
[time=2951] And those weren't just words.
[time=2952] My father walked with God.
[time=2956] And I always said as a kid, "I want to be like Dad.
[time=2959] I want to walk with God like Dad walks with God." And you can know that, to be a born-again Christian means that he is with us.
[time=2969] I walk with him, and I talk with him, and I converse with him.
[time=2974] He's my friend.
[time=2976] He's with me.
[time=2979] And because he's with me, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou it with me.
[time=2990] Fear thou not for I am with thee, be not dismayed for I am thy God.
[time=2994] I will strengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will poll thee.
[time=2999] With the right hand of my righteousness, Isaiah 41 dead, he's with me, let your conversation
[time=3005] be without covetousness, and be content with such things as he have, for he hath said,
[time=3012] I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, "The Lord is my
[time=3019] helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me," Hebrews 13-5, in that great God
[time=3025] is with us.
[time=3027] And when you know that he is with you, you can say no to the golden images, yes to the
[time=3035] grapes, and be still and know that he is God.
[time=3039] Now, if you're here unsaved, may I suggest to you, this is not something that just comes because you're a Baptist, or because you're religious, or because you believe the Bible even.
[time=3050] It comes with a personal relationship with him.
[time=3054] And there's nothing worse in this world than being alone, really alone, to fight your
[time=3060] threats, and to hold your own, and to struggle.
[time=3065] But once you come into a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, from the moment you lift your heart to God and say, "Lord, save me." He comes within me to live, and I can know on a day-by-day basis that God is with me.
[time=3081] And I think most of the great heroes of the faith have been aware of that presence.
[time=3089] I was at Moody Bible Institute preaching there at their pastor's conference just a little over a week ago.
[time=3096] And in the president's dining room one night, before we went out to the meeting, a number of speakers got together, and one man who had just returned from Romania.
[time=3107] And he was telling about the great revival in Romania, and how God was working in unique ways.
[time=3113] He said a man would come out to preach, and the people would gather around him, protecting
[time=3119] him from the enemy, the communists.
[time=3123] And it got to the place where the enemy even opened fire on the students and the boys and girls and the adults around the pastor, and blood began to shed, and all of a sudden that whole nation was united with one united force against the enemy.
[time=3141] But it started with preaching.
[time=3144] And the preacher would go to a town and he'd preach, and the people would gather hundreds of thousands of them in various towns and villages, would gather around the preacher, and they would, in unison say this, there is a God, there is a God, there is a God.
[time=3162] Can you imagine in that country for 45 years it was against the law to believe in God?
[time=3167] And they're saying there is a God, and then they change their words a little bit, and they would go like this, God is with us, God is with us, God is with us, and so it is.
[time=3183] God is with us.
[time=3184] John Patton, the great missionary to the New Hebrides, was asked the question, how is it possible for you to bury your wife and your children in one grave with all the nationals
[time=3194] gathered around?
[time=3196] And he said, one thing brought me through, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end
[time=3205] of the age." David Livingston in Africa was asked, "How is it possible for you to endure Africa all
[time=3213] alone for so many years?" He said, "I had the promise of a gentleman, Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end
[time=3223] of the age." And Hudson Taylor, I don't know whether you know that much about Hudson Taylor or not.
[time=3231] He was from a bygone era, the founder of the China Inland Mission, and a great hero of
[time=3237] the faith.
[time=3238] When I was a kid, Hudson Taylor, that was just something very special.
[time=3242] And you look at him as being extraordinary, almost superhuman, his ability to work and
[time=3248] preach and disseminate the word throughout China, but Taylor had his problems.
[time=3255] Taylor had his pressures, like we have them.
[time=3258] And he got to the place in his life where he just almost came to an end of himself.
[time=3262] He said, "I just can't go on." And he began to search for answers.
[time=3267] And he found the answer.
[time=3268] Interestingly enough, it was in a book written by a man whose name was McCartney.
[time=3272] And in Hudson Taylor's spiritual secret, in the chapter entitled "The Exchange Life,"
[time=3278] Hudson Taylor gives the secret to a victorious Christian life, and I want to leave it with you this morning.
[time=3283] I hope you'll still read the book, but I'm going to give you the kernel of that book,
[time=3290] Hudson Taylor's spiritual secret.
[time=3291] He wrote to his mother.
[time=3292] He said, "Mother, I have found the secret to the victorious Christian life." And I found it in one little saying, and I want to give it to you.
[time=3301] I'd like to have you write it down, if you will, on pencil and paper, because I think the more you reflect on it, the more precious it will be.
[time=3309] It goes like this, and I quote him, "The Lord Jesus received his holiness begun."
[time=3315] Now, let me stop right there and say, "Don't be afraid of that word holiness." It's a wonderful, wonderful word.
[time=3322] We need holiness of life.
[time=3323] The Lord Jesus received his holiness begun.
[time=3326] All right, line number two.
[time=3328] The Lord Jesus cherished his holiness advancing.
[time=3335] You have that?
[time=3338] The Lord Jesus received his holiness begun.
[time=3341] The Lord Jesus cherished his holiness advancing.
[time=3344] All right, here's the bottom line and the most important line.
[time=3347] The Lord Jesus counted on as never absent his holiness.
[time=3358] Complete.
[time=3361] What does that mean?
[time=3362] If I can count on him as never absent, what does that mean?
[time=3366] He's with me.
[time=3369] The Lord is at hand.
[time=3371] I think the epitome of holiness in the Christian's life is to be able to live in that aura,
[time=3381] to live with that atmosphere, to live with that consciousness, that God is with me.
[time=3387] The Lord is with me.
[time=3392] And to live with the conscious knowledge that God is with me is complete holiness.
[time=3397] I want you to leave here with that on your heart and that on your mind.
[time=3402] And as you drive your car today or tomorrow, or as you work around the house, or as you meet the crisis of the day, or as you come to cataclysmic situations, just remember,
[time=3412] the Lord is at hand.
[time=3414] No wonder Paul can say, all right, he's at hand.
[time=3417] Don't worry about anything.
[time=3418] Be anxious for nothing.
[time=3420] But in everything by prayer and supplication we're thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God, and his peace will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
[time=3431] The Lord is at hand.
[time=3433] Let's say it together.
[time=3434] Out loud.
[time=3435] Ready?
[time=3436] The Lord is at hand.
[time=3437] One more time.
[time=3438] The Lord is at hand.
[time=3440] God is with us.
[time=3441] [AMEN] Thank you, Father, for that promise.
[time=3456] We've been sharing with you this morning the ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra,
[time=3462] a solo from Star Bratagum and a duet from Keith and Star Bratagum.
[time=3467] The message today was from our special guest, Dr. Charles Wagner, President of Grand Rapids Baptist College and Seminary.
[time=3475] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior, just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3485] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for
[time=3491] my sins, and today I have a need for Christ to come in and be my Savior.
[time=3496] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3501] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
