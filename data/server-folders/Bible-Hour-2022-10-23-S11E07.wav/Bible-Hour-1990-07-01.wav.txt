[time=0] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=60] In a day of high-tech families and high- pressured living, dads everywhere are looking for models.
[time=73] Is it Bill Cosby, Dr. Benjamin Spock, James Dobson, all of the above? None of the above.
[time=81] I believe the Bible has the answer to the role model search by every dad.
[time=86] [MUSIC]
[time=96] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=101] Thank you for joining us.
[time=103] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. David Jullinger, Professor of Bible at Cedarville College.
[time=109] We encourage you to open your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=113] Our special music today includes a solo from Allison Heckerman, a song from Rejoice,
[time=123] and a solo from Denise Mitchell.
[time=126] We now join our service as the ladies' choir brings us a song entitled, "O Glorious Love."
[time=135] [MUSIC]
[time=142] In my darkness, Jesus found me, touched my eyes and made me see.
[time=153] Rotten, strange and long have found me, gave me life and liberty.
[time=165] O Glorious Love of Christ, my Lord divine, that made it soon to save us all and mine.
[time=177] Through all my days and living with the love.
[time=183] My soul was silent together, I worship Him forever and raise Him for His glorious love.
[time=194] O amazing truth to ponder, be whom angels hosts attend.
[time=209] More of them got sun but wonder.
[time=215] He became the sinner's friend.
[time=221] O Glorious Love of Christ, my Lord divine, that made it soon to save us all and mine.
[time=232] Through all my days and living with the love.
[time=239] My soul was silent together, I worship Him forever and raise Him for His glorious love.
[time=263] And raise Him for His glorious love.
[time=289] [AMEN]
[time=298] Thank you ladies for that wonderful ministry.
[time=301] I remarked in the first service that the last two rows of the choir are much better looking than on normal Sunday morning with those men back there.
[time=309] Then I had to apologize to about ten men for doing that.
[time=312] Men we will be singing again with the choir next week.
[time=316] Ladies that was a special tribute to the fathers and an announcement that we love the Lord and praise Him for the love that He gives back to us.
[time=324] God of our fathers, him number 573, will be singing the first, second and fourth stanzas with the trumpet fanfare before each verse, him number 573.
[time=346] [AMEN - 112 seconds]
[time=468] Thank you very much for participating in our singing.
[time=471] We continue with music now as Allison Heckerman comes to sing for us.
[time=475] Allison just recently graduated from Carroll High School and the privilege of singing for their graduation has been singing in our choir this entire year.
[time=485] We appreciate her and we appreciate her ministry that she has today, especially for fathers.
[time=490] Let's listen as she sings for us.
[time=494] I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl.
[time=508] My face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world, but that's all right.
[time=517] This long is I can have one wish I pray.
[time=523] When people look inside my life, I want to hear them say.
[time=531] She's got her father's eyes, her father's eyes.
[time=540] Eyes to find the burning things so the road is not around.
[time=547] Eyes to find the source of help when help just can't be found.
[time=555] Eyes full of compassion, seeing every pain, knowing what you're going through and feeling it the same.
[time=569] Just like my father's eyes, my father's eyes, my father's eyes, just like my father's eyes.
[time=595] On that day when we will pay for all the deeds we have done, food or bed they'll all be had to see by everyone.
[time=610] When you stand and tell all the things you see in me, more than anything I know I want your words to be.
[time=626] She had her father's eyes, her father's eyes.
[time=635] Eyes to find the burning things when the road is not around.
[time=642] Eyes to find the source of help when help just can't be found.
[time=650] Eyes full of compassion, seeing every pain, knowing what you're going through and feeling it the same.
[time=664] Just like my father's eyes, my father's eyes, my father's eyes.
[time=696] Just like my father's eyes.
[time=709] We've had a lot of very warm days recently in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and not only do we have the warm days, but we give you a warm welcome.
[time=722] We're glad that you're watching the Bible Hour today.
[time=725] This Sunday is Father's Day.
[time=727] You'll be watching this one week delayed, but we want to just take this moment to wish all the fathers a very happy Father's Day
[time=734] and hope that while you're receiving accolades and praise from your family, that you'll be reminded again that it's your responsibility to raise your family
[time=743] and to strengthen your family and encourage them.
[time=746] And I hope you're doing that on a regular basis and that you're making God the head of your household.
[time=752] Next Sunday, our speaker will be one of our associate pastors, Jim Pearson.
[time=756] I hope that you'll join us and continue to watch us weekly.
[time=760] I've been telling you for a number of weeks now about a special event that's going to be taking place at Blackhawk Baptist Church on July 1st at 4 p.m.
[time=769] That's our 17th annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=773] I hope that you'll take the time to come and join with us.
[time=776] We'll have a number of our local politicians here with us as our special guests and we'll introduce them.
[time=782] We'll also have a special musical guest, Gary McSpadden.
[time=786] Gary is a former member of the Gather Vocal Band and has sung a number of times in our community and I know that many of you have enjoyed his music.
[time=794] He has now chosen to do a solo ministry and he's coming to our church on July 1st at 4 p.m.
[time=801] as a part of the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=803] He now has a ministry that focuses on the family and the healing of hurting hearts and souls
[time=810] and getting them involved not only knowing Jesus Christ but knowing him in a personal way.
[time=815] He'll have a wonderful ministry with us and I hope you'll come and join us again that Sunday July 1st at 4 p.m.
[time=823] I've also been mentioning the booklet Reflections in Verse.
[time=827] These are marvelous little quotations that were written by our speaker from last week, Dr. Charles Wagner.
[time=834] We want to encourage you to write today for this booklet.
[time=837] It's absolutely free. You can just simply write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=848] Just ask for the booklet Reflections in Verse and write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=860] Our special speaker today is Dr. David Drelinger and again I have the privilege of having him in the studio and I want to welcome him to Blackhawk today. Good morning, Dave.
[time=868] We've had a privilege of being together a number of years on the West Coast.
[time=872] I was just thinking this morning as I was preparing for the services that we've been involved in weddings,
[time=878] gospel team outreach, church services, planning at the local, at the college there at Western Baptist College,
[time=886] and we've had some wonderful times together.
[time=888] That's right. It's good to be together again. It's hard to believe that now we're so close in the Midwest.
[time=892] Yeah, it's amazing. We have so many friends out on the West Coast and yet sometimes the Lord just happens to call us back here
[time=899] and in spite of the heat and everything, I'm glad to be back here and ministering here at Blackhawk
[time=905] and I know that you are happy in your work at Cedarville College. How long have you been at Cedarville, Dave?
[time=910] We've been at Cedarville just one year. We just completed our first academic year.
[time=915] In fact, the year ago, Monday, we got in our truck and headed for Cedarville, Ohio, and it's just been an intensely exciting year for us.
[time=924] That's great. In your major responsibilities there are what?
[time=927] Teaching in the Bible department, we've expanded our Bible program to give every student a Bible minor.
[time=933] And so in the expansion of our faculty, I was asked to come and teach many of the Bible courses required of all students.
[time=939] You're certainly qualified. We remember while you're teaching in chapel messages as well as visiting your church from time to time
[time=947] and hearing you speak, you had a tremendous ministry just outside of Salem, Oregon and the community Baptist Church there and that was great. Dave is not only a great speaker, he's a wonderful organist.
[time=958] I remember it's been almost four years now, Dave, that you were the organist at my daughter's wedding there in Salem, Oregon.
[time=964] I didn't realize it was that long ago. Time really does fly. It really does. But we're glad that you're here today and we look forward in just a few minutes to David Drelinger speaking in our morning service and on the Bible hour.
[time=976] Just before we close, I'd like to offer one more book and make you aware that it's available.
[time=982] It's called Winning Words for Daily Living. This again was written by Charles Wagner and it's a compilation of the number of his radio broadcasts.
[time=990] He's been on the radio for a number of years and these are just playing down-to-earth simple messages that are short
[time=998] but will encourage you on a daily basis. There are some 200 daily devotionals that will really change your life.
[time=1005] I hope that you'll take advantage and write for this booklet today. You can receive this booklet by writing and sending $15 or more
[time=1013] and write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1022] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1031] We really appreciate the fact that you've been watching us weekly and supporting us in your prayers and in your financial giving.
[time=1038] We appreciate that very much. We go back now to the live portion of our service and I hope that you will stay with us for this important message on this Father's Day.
[time=1068] [MUSIC - 183 seconds]
[time=1279] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1286] Thank you, Rejoice.
[time=1288] I talked with one of the men this week in our church and he was reading in 1 Timothy and he told me about one of the words that really stuck with him and I haven't gotten it out of my mind either this week. It was the word absorbed.
[time=1302] When you listen to that song and you talk about Jesus Christ being more than wonderful being more than miraculous, that's what Jesus means to me, you've got to have a relationship with Jesus Christ to experience the power that he has in our lives.
[time=1317] And I hope right now in your life that you're not only just reading the scripture or that you're not just coming to church and fellowshiping on Sunday, but you're literally being absorbed. God promises also in Philippians that he says, "I want to help you. I want to help you grow in the things of the Lord." That's when you can experience those wonderful things that Jesus promises he has for us.
[time=1340] My privilege again to introduce to you our speaker, Dr. David Drolinger was a very dear friend of mine. We taught at Western Baptist College together for five years.
[time=1350] I remember when he took over the reins of the community Baptist Church in a town near Salem, Oregon and revitalized that small church and made it into a large church with a great number of people coming to the Lord.
[time=1363] We've been on gospel teams together. We've been in business meetings together about the existence of the college and we've had some wonderful times together serving the Lord.
[time=1373] Dr. Drolinger has recently moved from Oregon to Ohio and he is a professor in the Bible department at Cedarville, Ohio.
[time=1382] In a moment, he's going to come and minister to us, but I'm just so glad that he and his wife have the opportunity to be with us today and we certainly are privileged for the fact that he is here and able to speak to us today.
[time=1393] Just before he comes to speak to us though, let's draw our hearts again once again to music as Denise Mitchell sings for us.
[time=1412] [MUSIC]
[time=1422] Singing them over again to me. Wonderful words of life. Let me more of their beauty see.
[time=1438] Wonderful words of life. Words of life and beauty teach me faith and beauty.
[time=1454] Beautiful words. Wonderful words of life. Beautiful words. Wonderful words. Wonderful words of life.
[time=1475] Christ the blessing one gives to all. Wonderful words of life. Listen well to the louding call. Wonderful words of life.
[time=1496] Jesus only save your sanctify forever. Beautiful words. Wonderful words. Wonderful words of life. Beautiful words. Wonderful words of life.
[time=1524] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=1572] Wonderful words. Wonderful words of life. Beautiful words. Wonderful words of life. Beautiful words. Wonderful words of life.
[time=1595] [MUSIC]
[time=1616] Thank you Denise. We express our gratitude today for all of the beautiful music and all of the times contributed to our love for God and our ability to worship Him together today.
[time=1624] What a privilege it is for my wife and me to be with you at Black Hawk Baptist Church. She's sitting way in the back over here, a beautiful lady accompanying me.
[time=1632] I don't know where I'd be today if it wasn't for her and I hope that you might have opportunity to meet her after the service.
[time=1639] This is my second visit to Black Hawk Baptist Church. I was here in 1975 when you were in the building across the street and I was here with the band from Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1650] And we had a good time. It was a day kind of like today where it was hot and humid and we had on tuxedos and the gals had on formals and I think I lost 14 pounds in the service that evening as we got through the concert but it was at some expense.
[time=1665] It's a delight to be with you on this Father's Day and I wish all of the fathers who are here a very happy Father's Day. It's a special one for me.
[time=1673] It's my first Father's Day as a grandpa. Our grandson was born last November and we're just excited about being grandparents.
[time=1682] My wife has pictures if you'd like to see them. She'll be available.
[time=1687] Pastor Kobe asked me this morning if we had a picture large enough that the TV camera could pick it up and I wish I'd known that I have one about this big.
[time=1694] I would have been happy to bring and share with you.
[time=1697] Father's Day is a special time. Someone has said that Father's Day is like Mother's Day but the gifts are cheaper and I do.
[time=1707] I do hope dads that you got some kind of gift. I got a Paisley tie regardless of what Hallmark cards say about Paisley ties.
[time=1714] I think they're wonderful to my wife even let me pick it out and I'm not wearing it today but I do have one and I really appreciate having it.
[time=1722] I read this past week of a Texan who was interested in buying a gift for his dad. He had a reputation for finding some really exotic gifts for his father.
[time=1731] One year he gave them hang gliding lessons and another year he gave him the complete collection of slim Whitman recordings.
[time=1739] And he was just scratching his head and he finally found a bird that could speak five languages and could sing the yellow rose of Texas while standing on one leg.
[time=1751] And the thing cost him ten thousand dollars. He said well you know my dad's worth it so he paid the money and packed up the bird and shipped it off to his dad for Father's Day.
[time=1761] About a week later he was talking to his dad on the phone and he said by the way how did you like the bird? His dad said it was delicious.
[time=1773] Oh we don't know what happens to some of those gifts we give doing. But in all seriousness on a day like today I think it's important for us to address ourselves to the need to find a model father.
[time=1791] In a highly pressurized society and high-tech living there's a search on by men today as they try to figure out how to be a good dad.
[time=1801] And this is Father's Day so I apologize to single moms I am not trying to leave you out or to families who don't have children but I trust that you will join me in appreciating the problem that men have if they try to figure out what would be a good model to follow.
[time=1820] I'm going to go over here to Georgetown Square and take your clipboard and pencil and attack people walking through the mall like they do sometimes figure out what kind of gum you're chewing or what kind of pop you like.
[time=1830] And try to find out from them whom they would identify as a model father you probably get some surprising answers no doubt somebody would pick Bill Cosby after all he is the father that entertains us all every Thursday night at eight o'clock isn't he?
[time=1844] Very long running television program focusing on the family and having some good laughs and after all he's written the book entitled Fatherhood and I did reading that book and as I read it I get the idea that Bill Cosby's concept of fatherhood is something like listening
[time=1861] to an entertaining cassette on a walk man while walking through a minefield.
[time=1866] You try to get as many laughs out of it without stepping on a booby trap. Some might pick Dr. Benjamin Spock who is the very popular author of Baby and Child Care.
[time=1877] Dr. Spock has an unusual philosophy of child rearing and fathering and in a recent interview for Newsweek magazine which published a special edition on the future of the family and the family of the future.
[time=1890] Dr. Spock almost suggests that it's too risky to be a father today after all with nuclear holocaust hanging over our head and overpopulation and global warming and homelessness and all of the social ills that threaten us.
[time=1904] Maybe it's just too big a risk but if you're going to be a father you need to appreciate that you need to have children that you don't talk down to but you'd be friends with.
[time=1915] And I almost come away from the interview thinking that Dr. Spock's philosophy of fatherhood is something like how to raise friends and obligate people.
[time=1924] No doubt if you talk to a Christian they would say well James Dobson that's the guy he's the model father that two children of his own founded focus on the family rights books magazines articles has radio broadcast all of that to help the family.
[time=1937] And I agree James Dobson is a monument to the Christian father but as I read his articles and listen to his broadcast and read his books and watch the videos I'm convinced that James Dobson is very transparent about his own concerns.
[time=1954] His own sense of inadequacy is very transparent about the question that he has about fathering and no doubt James Dobson would be very uncomfortable wearing the title model father.
[time=1966] And so the search goes on and we may not ask ourselves well what are we looking for anyway is a model really all that important.
[time=1974] Well Bruce Lockerbie and his book father love suggests that it is. He says some of the modern attitudes toward family structure and fatherhood are apparent in popular representations of fathers.
[time=1986] Judging from weekly television programming both reruns and current series the unfavorable portrait of fathers remains a constant ingredient of drama and entertainment.
[time=1997] The features of a father seen on television are often those of a simpleton or a lot a stumble bomb and incompetent the object of his children's well deserved disrespect.
[time=2009] So papra fathers are almost uniformly doctors or lawyers to preoccupied with their professional concerns to know or care about their wives and children.
[time=2018] No wonder then that these neglected women and teenagers wander into disastrous love affairs and juvenile delinquency.
[time=2025] Domestic comedies may offer greater variety in the occupation of fathers but these men whether blue collar workers or wall street bankers are among most universally portrayed as nincompoops.
[time=2036] Formals among them stands Archie Bunker as the prototypical father in American culture a bigot and a racist a hypocrite and chauvinist.
[time=2044] The foil for all of his wife's virtues the dark corner into which the light of his daughter's liberal education must shine.
[time=2052] On the whole fathers have been subjected to more than enough ridicule in father knows best my three sons Sanford and son and all in the family.
[time=2061] What today's father needs isn't further abused from smart Alex on television or feminists on soapboxes instead every father needs encouragement to do and keep on doing what his heart tells him is right to love his wife and children to teach his sons and daughters to become persons of characters.
[time=2078] To help him be this kind of man every father is looking for a model to emulate an original pattern to copy in his own life but in a world of cheap shots and caricatures demeaning to fathers where is a man to find what he's looking for.
[time=2092] And I would suggest this morning that the place to find the answer is in the word of God.
[time=2098] God portrays himself in the scripture as a father a father who loves his children a father who relates to his children.
[time=2106] He welcomes their fellowship he entertains their questions he nurses their hurts he confronts their disobedience all that they might grow up to be mature sons and daughters in the family of God.
[time=2117] There are many scriptures to which we could turn this morning to describe or to define this model father that is set forth for us so perfectly.
[time=2127] We're not talking now about trying to be ideal fathers men we're talking about following the example of the model father that we might be effective fathers successful fathers godly fathers.
[time=2141] Will you turn with me this morning to 2 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 3 looking at the first verse that we would consider today as it portrays for us the model father.
[time=2152] Here Paul suggests for us that our father is one who is lavish in encouragement.
[time=2160] In a day when our children are desperately searching for a sense of work and a personal identity they need a lot of encouragement.
[time=2171] And I believe that God the father sets that example for us as is described by Paul here.
[time=2177] In verse 3 Paul writes praise be to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of compassion and the God of all comfort.
[time=2185] Who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.
[time=2192] For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow into our lives so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
[time=2198] First of all the term comfort could be just as well and I believe appropriately translated encouragement.
[time=2205] See we're not talking here about comfort being that syrupy sentiment that oozes out in time of tragedy where one may come along and pat someone and say everything's going to be alright.
[time=2217] This is the idea of drawing alongside being available when needed speaking an appropriate word where one's very presence contributes to the stability and the growth and the encouragement and the challenge and the confidence of the one being encouraged.
[time=2232] And God the father relates to us in that way he is a great encourager.
[time=2238] Notice the words that suggest that.
[time=2240] First of all in verse 3 has described as the God of all comfort.
[time=2244] There is no dimension there is no nuance of encouragement that we might want for but God is able to provide it.
[time=2251] It also says that he's able to comfort us in all our troubles.
[time=2256] There has no need come into our lives. There is no experience with which we are confronted but God is capable of encouraging us and delivering us through it the better for it.
[time=2268] I also noticed in the last verse that we read in verse 5 just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives so through Christ our comfort overflows.
[time=2278] How exciting it is to know that the encouragement that comes from God is available it's adequate it's abundant and it's there for every kind of pressure which is the word for trouble here every kind of pressure that we might encounter.
[time=2292] And I'm suggesting man that if we're going to relate to our kids in a way that ensures their presence survival and their future success we must be men of encouragement.
[time=2303] We must be available drawing alongside to help our kids cope with pressure.
[time=2309] I am convinced that the success of peer pressure in influencing our kids is directly proportionate to the failure of parental encouragement.
[time=2322] I believe that parents stand at the ready to defend their children against the effective influence of peer pressure when they are available to encourage and stand alongside and speak the word and just be present with their kids.
[time=2340] To be willing to enter into what they're going through to try to understand not to just put your arm around them and say you'll survive everything will be alright I went through it when I was a kid everybody grows up everybody has to face this that's not what we're talking about.
[time=2355] It's a willingness to be there a willingness to listen with a non judgmental attitude saying tell me what's on your heart I want to know I'm interested in who you are.
[time=2368] To be alongside when it's time to dream the army ought not to be the one singing the song be all that you can be and do it in the army.
[time=2377] Parents ought to be the ones relating to their kids saying be all that you can be and I'm here to help you succeed.
[time=2384] God is that kind of God God suggests that he believes that you and I are capable of becoming like Jesus Christ.
[time=2394] Isn't that a lofty dream isn't that a great goal and God says go for it and I'm convinced that parents today need to encourage their kids to go for it.
[time=2405] It's a lot easier to steer some child toward a lofty goal than it is to try to perform a resurrection to get them to set a goal.
[time=2414] They need encouragement and God models that for us he is lavish in encouragement.
[time=2421] The story is told of Michael Elmore a gastroenterologist out in California I believe who when he was six years old was tested in his school and his parents were told he had an IQ of 90.
[time=2434] He bordered on mental retardation. His parents were flabbergasted and they went to the teacher and said couldn't he be tested again and the teacher said no he can't be the test is accurate it'll be all right.
[time=2449] The mother went home devastated and she and the father counseled together that they would not relate this to their son but they would encourage him to be all that he could be.
[time=2459] And they moved to Fort Wayne Indiana in 1962 and their son went through high school here Christian high school in your community went on to Indiana University and ultimately to medical school and on the day that he graduated from med school and received his MD.
[time=2475] His parents congratulated him and told him the story that while he was boasting an IQ of 126 from a college testing he had been diagnosed with an IQ of 90 when he was six years old.
[time=2492] And as Dr Elmore refers to that today he says my parents never told me I couldn't be a doctor until after I graduated with my degree.
[time=2501] Those parents believed in that kid and they encouraged him and no test would convince them that their son couldn't be all that he could be.
[time=2510] Folks our kids need encouragement like that. Dad's our kids need us alongside challenging them with that kind of encouragement.
[time=2521] Encouragement in times of problems assuring them that they can survive. Encouragement in times of dreams assuring them that they can succeed.
[time=2530] Our God who is lavish in encouragement however is also revealed in Hebrews 12 to be a God who is loving in discipline.
[time=2539] A very familiar passage to many parents probably you've read it again and again no doubt as you have struggled with the balance of discipline in your home.
[time=2548] But the writer says in verse 5 you've forgotten the word of encouragement that addresses you as sons my son do not make light of the Lord's discipline and do not lose heart when he rebukes you because the Lord disciplines those he love and he accepts every and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.
[time=2563] Indoor hardship is discipline God is treating you as sons for what son is not disciplined by his father.
[time=2569] If you are not disciplined and everyone undergoes discipline then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.
[time=2575] Three things I observe about our father who disciplines us first of all he disciplines us in love that's what the writer says in verse 6 he disciplines the son he loves.
[time=2587] What does that mean? Well the word translated love there excuse me as the idea of seeing the highest good and desiring the highest good for the object of one's love.
[time=2600] That means that when God disciplines us he does it not to try to destroy us not to crush us not to break our will but rather with the idea of moving us along toward the ultimate good that he knows we're capable of and that he knows his best for us.
[time=2619] Maybe your parents disciplined you that way mine did they would lay it on thick you know and the pain was agonizing and my mom would say two things she often would say I'm doing this because I love you as a right mom how about loving you a little less intensely.
[time=2634] Other times I'm doing this for your own good great the good that I need right now is to be relieved from pain.
[time=2643] But you know what I found out when I was about 18 years old and I left home to go to college and ultimately went into the service my mom had in those early days of my life perceived my future good.
[time=2658] And was determined that whatever means it took to keep me free from the distraction to keep me free from going off the path and protecting me.
[time=2670] She was willing to take the risk of disciplining me even as our Heavenly Father does.
[time=2675] The second thing that we read is that God disciplines us for our good verse 10.
[time=2680] He not only perceives the good he then meets out the discipline in order to minister to that good and channel us toward that good that we might at the end of verse 10 share in his holiness which means we've now grown up to experience that good.
[time=2697] And I believe that today's families call for that kind of discipline. I understand we live in the day of child abuse.
[time=2705] A time when abuse takes the form of physical beatings and verbal berating and I'm not talking about that.
[time=2713] I'm talking about biblical balanced discipline that is worked in the context of a godly concern for the good of our kids.
[time=2722] The solution to child abuse is not throwing away discipline.
[time=2727] The solution to the mistreatment of our kids is not to lift all of the restrictions.
[time=2734] The restrictions need to be there.
[time=2737] The balanced discipline needs to be there.
[time=2740] But we take our cue from God the Father who never beats us up.
[time=2746] Who never crushes us. Who never destroys us.
[time=2751] But rather disciplines us for our own good that we might ultimately mature.
[time=2759] And partaking his holiness where magic though it seems.
[time=2764] I come to the place where I obey him not because I'm afraid he might spank me.
[time=2770] But I obey him because I want to.
[time=2774] And every parent who disciplines their child every dad who disciplines his child ought to be motivated by that kind of biblical example.
[time=2782] He sees the highest good in his child. He is willing to minister to the highest good of that child.
[time=2788] And enjoy the fruit and the benefit of that one day when the child obeys not because he's afraid of what dad might do.
[time=2796] But because he wants to and he loves his father.
[time=2802] That is biblical balanced discipline.
[time=2805] And God suggests to us that he does whatever is necessary to enable us to succeed in the pursuit of the right priorities and the accomplishment of the highest good.
[time=2817] A God who is lavish in encouragement is also loving in discipline.
[time=2823] And there is a third characteristic of our father that I believe also warrants our attention today in light of current pressures on our homes and families.
[time=2831] And that's given to us in 1 John chapter 1 and verse 9.
[time=2835] This God who is lavish in encouragement.
[time=2838] This God who is loving in discipline is a God who is also liberal in forgiveness.
[time=2845] In 1 John 1 9 we read if we confess our sins. He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2854] That tells me of a God who is eager to hear my confession of wrongdoing.
[time=2859] He wants me to have the security and the confidence of being able to come into his presence relate to him exactly what happened and he promises to forgive.
[time=2869] The Ithae clause in 1 John 1 9 is not whether God will forgive our sin based upon its gravity.
[time=2877] The Ithae part of 1 John 1 9 is whether I will avail myself of the privilege God has afforded me to come in to make it known and make it right.
[time=2890] And he has promised me that when I do this God who is eager to listen to my confession is liberal in the forgiveness.
[time=2899] He goes beyond what I confess to him to the eradication of every other evidence of sin and disobedience.
[time=2909] Wow, what a father who not only forgives me what I did but goes beyond that and says I promise to never bring it up again. How about that?
[time=2921] We need to be parents who are willing to forgive our kids with the built in assurance that we give up the right to ever bring this up again.
[time=2932] We've talked about it. We've settled the issue. It's over.
[time=2937] I'm not suggesting here that God says that if I will confess my sin I am free of any discipline that might be warranted.
[time=2944] Forgiveness does not supplant discipline. There are many times when our actions eventually inconsequences.
[time=2951] And the forgiveness does not relieve us of the consequences.
[time=2955] But the forgiveness does make certain that my fellowship with my father is intact as I live out or through the consequences.
[time=2964] And that's the kind of climate that we as dads need to create in our homes.
[time=2969] Where our kids have the security and the confidence of knowing that once the discussion is finished,
[time=2975] once the discipline is prescribed, and once the experience is over with, we never talk about it again.
[time=2982] I know it's dads. It's hard sometimes to forget, isn't it?
[time=2986] We have those perfect computer memory banks that record every data bit and it's precise and it's accurate.
[time=2994] And we know the date and the time that the entry went in and we can call it up in microseconds.
[time=3001] But the Bible says that forgiveness means I refuse to bring it up again, even though I may remember it.
[time=3009] That suggests that I may even give up the right to say, will you never learn?
[time=3015] Have you done this again? How many times do I have to tell you?
[time=3021] Will you ever grow up? I've told you 500 million times not to exaggerate.
[time=3030] We have all those little frustrated expressions, don't we, of reminding our kids that they aren't perfect yet?
[time=3037] And we're wringing our hands because of it.
[time=3041] The Bible portrays for us a father who's liberal in forgiveness.
[time=3045] And I believe dads, what our kids need in a culture that puts a premium on revenge, that's behind the gang activity in our cities.
[time=3055] A culture that puts a premium on vengeance and getting what's mine and having my rights and exerting my influence,
[time=3063] our kids need to learn about forgiveness and they need to learn about it at home.
[time=3068] And I believe that we need to create a climate of forgiveness that is modeled after the forgiveness you and I have experienced from our Heavenly Father.
[time=3078] For we have gone into His presence over and over again, haven't we, and confess the same sin?
[time=3084] When's the last time God said to you, are you here again?
[time=3087] Are you bringing that same sin back? Haven't we been over this before?
[time=3092] God doesn't treat us that way.
[time=3095] And I'm suggesting men that in our homes, as we assume our place of authority and responsibility, as we give leadership to our families,
[time=3104] as we try to model for our kids, we concern ourselves with creating a climate that is similar to that created for us by God.
[time=3114] Statistics say that children form their opinions of God as a result of the influence of their dads.
[time=3123] I believe that our dads today need a role model and that model is God the Father.
[time=3129] I believe that our kids need a translation of what God is like in the flesh and blood of their dads so that they grow up with a balanced, appropriate view of what God is like.
[time=3143] A God who is lavish in forgiveness, a God who is loving in discipline, a God who is liberal in forgiveness.
[time=3153] I know that as I address you this morning, I'm talking to people of different varieties of experiences in your lives.
[time=3160] I may even be talking to some single moms this morning who are facing the struggle of rearing children without the benefit of dad being available.
[time=3170] And my heart goes out to you moms, and I wouldn't leave you out of our discussion this morning.
[time=3176] For I believe that the same God the Father that models for dads, models for single moms too.
[time=3183] And my prayer for you would be that you would avail yourself of this model,
[time=3189] and that you would create a climate in your home where there is lots of encouragement, where there is balance discipline, and where there is always forgiveness in response to confession.
[time=3202] That your children also might grow in their love and appreciation for God the Father.
[time=3208] And he wants to help single moms.
[time=3211] He is the husband to the widow and the father of the orphan, and he wants to be available.
[time=3217] No doubt I'm talking to some dads this morning who are experiencing the frustrations of fatherhood without the benefit of knowing the Heavenly Father
[time=3226] because you've never accepted Christ as personal Savior.
[time=3230] Whether you're a dad or a mom or maybe a non-parent, if you do not know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior today,
[time=3238] the Bible says God is not your Father.
[time=3241] He becomes your Father as the result of you being born into His family by believing that Christ died for your sins,
[time=3248] that He was raised again on the third day.
[time=3251] And He did that in love so we who were alienated from God might be born into His family, claim His name, know His goodness, experience His grace, and know that encouragement, discipline, and forgiveness that flows from the heart of God.
[time=3268] To everyone, grandparents, parents, moms, dads, Bill Cosby is alright.
[time=3276] I think a good dose of Bill Cosby is healthy.
[time=3279] He reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously.
[time=3283] I think Dr. Benjamin Spock has some good ideas.
[time=3287] Before our child was ever born, we received two copies of Baby and Child Care.
[time=3292] We gave one away and we wore the other one out.
[time=3296] I believe Dr. Spock has a point when he says we have to be friends of our children.
[time=3301] And certainly the contribution that Dr. James Dobson has made to the stability and the survival of the Christian family in a secular culture
[time=3311] can be evaluated only by God and only eternity will reveal the contribution that He has made.
[time=3318] But I am convinced this morning, friends of mine, at Black Hawk Baptist Church, that the model father who is worthy of our emulation is none other than God himself.
[time=3333] The story is told of four ministers who sat around a table one day discussing their preferences for translations of the scripture.
[time=3342] The first one to speak was partial to the King James Version.
[time=3346] Does I love the King James? I love the Old English. I love the poetic style. It's easy to memorize. People are familiar with it.
[time=3353] I really love the King James Version.
[time=3356] And the second gentleman sitting there in the circle said, "Well, I really like the New American Standard Bible.
[time=3361] It's faithful to the Greek and the Hebrew. It makes contemporary translations of words that may be lost in their meaning
[time=3369] in the Old English of the King James Version. It's kind of stilted in its reading, but it's accurate.
[time=3375] And I really get a lot of benefit from using the New American Standard Bible." The third man there said, "I like the new international version myself. It's very contemporary. It's easy to read.
[time=3386] It speaks in the vernacular of our name, and my kids can understand it." The fourth young minister sat there for a while and didn't speak.
[time=3396] And then he said, "I guess when it comes to translations and paraphrased editions of the Bible,
[time=3403] I like my dad's translation best." He put the Word of God into practice every day.
[time=3411] It was the most convincing translation I've ever seen.
[time=3416] Dad's may we commit ourselves this morning to translate the Word of God
[time=3422] and the character of God into flesh and blood that our children may see us
[time=3431] and come to know and love Him.
[time=3434] Will you join me in prayer?
[time=3436] All our heads are bowed and no one is looking around to fathers, mothers, non-parents, grandparents.
[time=3446] What is your relationship with Jesus Christ this morning?
[time=3451] On this Father.
[time=3461] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our ladies' chorus, soloist Allison Heckerman, rejoiced and soloist Denise Mitchell.
[time=3469] The message today was from our special guest, Dr. David Drolinger, from Cedarville College, Cedarville, Ohio.
[time=3476] If you've had time to think about the message today and you've responded to it and you'd like to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, just before we close today, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3488] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3490] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3498] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3501] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3506] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3510] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3514] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance, to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
