[time=0] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=2] Thank you, you may be sure.

[time=52] That wise old man Solomon had everything that this world could possibly offer.
[time=58] Riches, fame, beautiful homes, all of the material goods that money could possibly buy.
[time=64] Yet with all of that around him, in the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon wrote these words.
[time=71] "Meaningless, meaningless, utterly meaningless, everything is meaningless."
[time=79] Solomon learned the lesson that many of us learned today, that riches and fame and fortune do not bring true contentment.
[time=89] True contentment comes only through a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=94] Do you know Jesus Christ today?
[time=96] He's here waiting to come into your heart.
[time=100] (Music)
[time=110] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=114] Thank you for joining us.
[time=116] Our speaker today is Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=119] His message today is entitled, "True Contentment That Elusive Desire." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Philippians chapter 4.
[time=129] We will be looking at verses 10 through 13.
[time=132] Our special music today includes a solo from Kevin Rowe, a song from the Men's Singers Quartet,
[time=140] and a solo from Marilyn Wong.
[time=144] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "My Faith Still Holds."
[time=159] (Music)
[time=171] I thought I had to see and feel, to prove that what I loved was really real.
[time=193] A passion turned to precious things I held to dust.
[time=205] I got reality this simple time.
[time=218] My faith still holds on to the rise of God for me.
[time=230] Oh, blessed God of ages well, for me is near me.
[time=242] I clap your hands, I trust in things I cannot see.
[time=254] My faith still holds on to the rise of God for me.
[time=267] And oh, a joy to walk this way, I'll follow this, help this good place,
[time=286] oh where I am, oh where I'm home, I may not see.
[time=302] I choose to place my trust in God for me.
[time=315] My faith still holds on to the rise of God for me.
[time=327] Oh, blessed God of ages well, for ages well, for me is near me.
[time=339] Oh, blessed God of ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well,
[time=365] for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well,
[time=400] I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus, the Nazarene, and wonder how He could love me
[time=406] a sinner condemned unclean.
[time=408] I'm number 512, please, we'll sing the first and fourth stanzas, then we will go to five hundred thirteen and sing both verses of that chorus.
[time=417] Oh, blessed God of ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well,
[time=444] for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well, for ages well,
[time=1247] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=1257] (audience applauding) - Well, if Sunday school didn't perk up your spirits
[time=1268] or the bright sunshiney morning, I'm sure that song did.
[time=1271] Thank you to the men's singers, to Kevin for all the music this morning, for creating such a great mood for worshiping the Lord.
[time=1277] Let's pray.
[time=1279] Father, thank you so much this morning.
[time=1281] Thank you so much for a simple song and yet a profound song.
[time=1285] Can he, could he, would he?
[time=1288] Can he, oh yes you can, because we know Father that you are omnipotent.
[time=1292] You can do anything.
[time=1293] We thank you for the miracle of regeneration, the way that you could give us everlasting life.
[time=1298] Could you, oh yes Father, we know that you could.
[time=1301] You sent your son to die on Calvary's cross that we might have everlasting life.
[time=1306] And did you, oh yes we know you did.
[time=1308] We thank you for that.
[time=1310] We thank you for the fact that we can have everlasting life today by coming to you and trusting in you.
[time=1316] But Father, we also thank you for the fact that we can come to you this morning.
[time=1320] We can ask your blessing upon our service, but we can also come to you with our needs.
[time=1324] Father, I would pray for the continued recovery of Betty Mahoney, one of our super sixties.
[time=1330] I would just pray that the surgery on her hip would be completely successful, that you would continually heal her and bring her back to our program.
[time=1338] Father, I would pray for Esther Crawford and her family in the loss of a mother.
[time=1342] I would just pray that you would continue to comfort her, comfort their family in Toledo as they go through this time.
[time=1349] Father, I would pray for all that are here this morning.
[time=1351] Some suffering from cancer, some from arthritis, some from diabetes.
[time=1356] Father, whatever the ailment might be, I know that you are here, that you have the power to wrap your arms around us, to give us peace and contentment, peace in the midst of a storm, but we can always know that you are with us and here for us today.
[time=1369] Father, we ask your blessing upon the remainder of our service, we ask you to bless me as I preach, bless Marilyn as she sings in Christ's name, amen.
[time=1379] [MUSIC - 147 seconds]
[time=1535] - Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=1540] Indeed, I wanna thank Him for the fact that He gave His life on the cross.
[time=1547] And then, that we might come to Him and have everlasting life because of the power of that shed blood.
[time=1554] It has been several weeks since I've had the opportunity to share with you on a Sunday morning.
[time=1558] And I'm glad for that that I have the opportunity today.
[time=1561] But I know that I have enjoyed over the past few weeks because I'm sure you have the various speakers that we've been able to bring to Blackhawk, like to thank Pete and the pulpit supply committee for the fine men that they've brought to share from the word of God with us.
[time=1574] Some of them have been from within the Baptist church, from various institutions, but others are our friends from some other denominations of like faith and they have come and they've shared with us.
[time=1584] It's been a joy to share with them, to get to know them a little better, to have fun with them before the service and after it's just been a good time in the Lord.
[time=1594] You may have heard the story about the little rural city in Indiana that didn't quite always have that type of relationship between the different denominations.
[time=1602] In fact, there were only two churches in this town, a Methodist church and a Baptist church.
[time=1606] And the two ministers didn't get along real well and there was kind of a rivalry there.
[time=1611] So the congregation had kind of spilled over into their lives and so they had very little to do with each other.
[time=1617] Well, the inevitable happened.
[time=1618] One day, the Baptist minister was away on vacation and couldn't be reached under any circumstances and one of the members of this local Baptist church passed away.
[time=1627] The family didn't know what to do.
[time=1629] They were in a turmoil.
[time=1630] There was no pastor to bury their beloved father.
[time=1633] What would they do?
[time=1634] Well, they swallowed their pride.
[time=1635] They walked across town to the parsonage of the local Methodist church, knocked on the door.
[time=1640] They said, Reverend Jones, we're from the Baptist church down the street and we know that you're not our pastor, but we have a pastor who's on vacation and we've had a death in the family.
[time=1650] Would you bury our father tomorrow afternoon?
[time=1653] Well, the pastor thought about it for a moment and he said, well, indeed I would be glad to bury your Baptist father tomorrow afternoon, but I'm going to have to get permission from the local bishop.
[time=1663] So he went down to the local Western Union office and began to tap out the message and the message was sent and it said, may I have your permission to bury a Baptist man tomorrow afternoon?
[time=1674] Well, before Reverend Jones could turn and leave, the message came back very quickly.
[time=1678] Just one line on the telegram from the bishop it said, bury all the Baptist you can.
[time=1683] (audience laughs) You may have also heard the story about the lady from another church in the neighborhood who came into the local Baptist church.
[time=1691] The pastor was in his office studying and she came in.
[time=1695] She said, pastor, we've had a death in our family.
[time=1698] Could you do a funeral for us?
[time=1700] Pastor said, oh, it's certainly, I know you're not from my church, but it's not necessary to be a Baptist.
[time=1705] I'd be glad to do the burial for the member of your family.
[time=1709] She said, well, pastor, it's not a member of our family, it's my dog.
[time=1712] The pastor looked at her kind of sternly and he said, well, madam, I'll have you know, I don't do funerals for dogs at this church.
[time=1720] She said, well, that's too bad.
[time=1722] I was gonna pay the pastor who did it $500.
[time=1725] Do you know another pastor who would be going to do it in town?
[time=1727] He straightened up in his chair quickly and said, well, ma'am, why didn't you tell me this was a Baptist dog?
[time=1732] (audience laughing) Enjoyed the men.
[time=1736] Also, since the time when I shared with you last, our family had a great opportunity for about 10 or 11 days in Florida, had a great time of relaxation.
[time=1745] One of the things that I learned from that vacation was that children have a totally different perspective of what vacation is to be than what adults do.
[time=1755] My idea of vacation is relaxing in a motel room or a condominium and reading, watching television, doing whatever I wanna do.
[time=1763] But I noticed for our four-year-old Kyle, it was vacation this year was to stay up as late as he could, to never have to go to bed unless he decided and to just stay up as late as he wanted.
[time=1774] Well, one night as four-year-olds can get, he was basically out of control in the room that we ran.
[time=1780] He was about 10 o'clock or 10.30 at night, he was bouncing up and down on the bed that was in the room and finally, Linda had to get a little stern with him 'cause he just wouldn't settle down.
[time=1789] So finally, she said, Kyle, we want you to get your rest.
[time=1793] Four-year-old boys need their rest.
[time=1795] And if you don't get your rest tonight, tomorrow you'll be tired, you'll be cranky, you won't be easy to get along with and we don't wanna have an unhappy boy tomorrow.
[time=1805] Well, the message got through.
[time=1806] It got through a little stronger than what we thought.
[time=1809] The next morning, we got up and we got dressed and we were going down the hallway to have breakfast and these two or three men came out of this room.
[time=1816] They were staying at the same place that we were and they were obviously on a golf trip.
[time=1821] Well, they hadn't gone to bed early that night.
[time=1822] It was obvious.
[time=1823] One of them was kind of bleary-eyed and he had a cup of coffee in his hand, was looking very tired, kind of leaning against the wall.
[time=1830] Kyle looked at him and looked at his mother and looked back at the man and said, "You should have gone to bed last night "when your mama told you to." (audience laughing) We learned from our children every day.
[time=1844] It was a great time.
[time=1846] But it is always great to share from the word with you.
[time=1849] If you have a Bible with you this morning, I'd like you to turn with me to the fourth chapter of the book of Philippians.
[time=1855] The fourth chapter of the book of Philippians in this morning, I want to speak to you for a time on the topic of true contentment, that elusive desire.
[time=1865] True contentment, that elusive desire.
[time=1869] Everyone in the world today and for all the ages has been seeking contentment.
[time=1873] The Apostle Paul gives us great truth and insight into true contentment.
[time=1878] This morning from the word.
[time=1880] Father, thank you again for your word.
[time=1882] Thank you for the way that you bless, the way that you lead.
[time=1885] Thank you now for the fact that we can study your word.
[time=1888] Give me wisdom, give me insight to proclaim it truly.
[time=1891] Help me now in Christ's name.
[time=1894] [AMEN] A couple of weeks ago, I read a great inspirational book.
[time=1899] I am not one who was generally given to great shows of emotion.
[time=1903] But as I read the book a couple of weeks ago, I found that on probably three or four occasion, tears were in my eyes, as I read a book called Come Back, the story of a baseball player by the name of Dave D'Ravecki.
[time=1915] Dave D'Ravecki was a fine, up-and-coming Major League baseball star.
[time=1920] A fine left-handed pitcher, blessed with pinpoint control and a 90 mile an hour fastball.
[time=1925] He was on his way to start him.
[time=1927] He had already had two or three great seasons.
[time=1930] He had won games in the Major League Championship Series.
[time=1933] He was on his way to a great future, a million dollar contract.
[time=1937] Perhaps 20 game seasons, Dave D'Ravecki was going to be a star.
[time=1942] But then disaster struck.
[time=1944] One morning, he discovered that there was a lump on the bone of his throwing arm.
[time=1950] He didn't think too much about it at the time, but it kept growing.
[time=1954] He finally realized he needed to get it checked.
[time=1957] When he went to the Cleveland Clinic to have it checked, the doctors told him they would watch it for a period of time, but to go ahead and play and come back at a later time.
[time=1966] But it continued to grow.
[time=1968] When he came back, they did a biopsy.
[time=1971] The biopsy came back malignant.
[time=1973] As the doctors came into the room, they told Dave D'Ravecki this.
[time=1978] They said, "Dave, we have found a cancerous tumor "on the bone of your arm, your pitching arm.
[time=1983] "In order to get that tumor out, "we will have to take away a lot of the bone "on your throwing arm.
[time=1989] "We will also have to take away probably at least 50% "of the deltoid muscle in your arm.
[time=1995] "Dave, your pitching days are over.
[time=1998] "You're gonna have to find another career." Dave D'Ravecki said that for a time he was devastated, but he quickly made up his mind that that wouldn't be the end of his career.
[time=2007] He would pitch again.
[time=2009] The surgery was performed, the tumor was removed.
[time=2012] But Dave D'Ravecki refused to accept that his career was finished.
[time=2016] And in a great comeback, he went through months and months of grueling physical therapy.
[time=2021] He worked on his muscles and tried to teach himself to pitch with a different set of arm muscles.
[time=2027] Finally, he came back.
[time=2029] And after a few tune up games in the minor leagues, he came back, and on August 10th of 1989, the sports world was flabbergasted by the return to the major leagues of this great Christian believer and pitcher, Dave D'Ravecki.
[time=2043] He pitched his first game.
[time=2045] It was a shutout.
[time=2046] He won the game two to nothing.
[time=2048] The sports world was amazed.
[time=2050] Dave D'Ravecki said he was high as a kite.
[time=2053] He had seen the down times of cancer surgery, the pain, the grueling rehabilitation.
[time=2060] But now he was back on top.
[time=2062] He had made it back to the major leagues.
[time=2065] But then unexpectedly, disaster struck again.
[time=2069] Five days later, Dave D'Ravecki started another game.
[time=2072] And in this game, he uncorked with his pitching arm a 90-mile-an-hour fastball.
[time=2076] And as he did, the audience watched as the pitching bone and his pitching arm shattered.
[time=2082] And he catapulted, head over heels off the pitching mound, in horrible grueling pain.
[time=2088] The bone had broken right at the spot where the surgery had been performed.
[time=2092] It was casted, it was x-rayed.
[time=2095] The story got even worse.
[time=2097] The growth was coming back on his arm.
[time=2099] Dave D'Ravecki realized this time that his career was over.
[time=2104] And in 1989, he retired.
[time=2108] For Dave D'Ravecki, disaster had struck.
[time=2111] But Dave D'Ravecki had a great insight into the scriptures and great contentment in his lord and in his service to him.
[time=2119] Dave D'Ravecki said in his book that he had seen the bad times, he had seen the good times.
[time=2125] But even though he was forced to retire from baseball, like other players, he was not going to get angry toward God and disappointed with life.
[time=2134] He was not going to fall into depression.
[time=2136] He was not going to turn to drugs or suicide, like so many others.
[time=2140] In fact, Dave D'Ravecki said this.
[time=2143] He said, "I'm clearly not done with adversity.
[time=2149] "My future is as unknown as before.
[time=2152] "All I can say for certain is that I'm done with baseball.
[time=2156] "When I think back on my career, "I do so with a big fat smile on my face.
[time=2161] "How could I feel anything else?
[time=2164] "I'm one of the fortunate few who was able to realize "the dream of playing in the major leagues.
[time=2171] "I got to play with the big boys, "and for that, I'm grateful." Dave D'Ravecki is an outstanding illustration
[time=2182] of what the Apostle Paul is speaking about in our text this morning in the fourth chapter of Philippians.
[time=2188] True contentment, a contentment that can only come from a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2195] This morning, as we read these verses, I would like us to see three aspects of true contentment.
[time=2202] Three aspects of the true contentment that the Apostle Paul had, that Dave D'Ravecki has today, and that all of us, as believers, can have if we have embraced Christ as Savior and are willing to walk with Him in our daily lives.
[time=2218] Beginning with verse 10 of chapter four, Paul writes, "I rejoice greatly in the Lord, "that at last you have renewed your concern for me.
[time=2226] "Indeed, you have been concerned, "but you had no opportunity to show it.
[time=2231] "I am not saying this because I am in need, "for I have learned to be content "whatever the circumstances.
[time=2238] "I know what it is to be in need, "and I know what it is to have plenty.
[time=2243] "I have learned the secret of being content "in any and every situation, "whether well-fed or hungry, "whether living in plenty or in want.
[time=2254] "And then I think to add on to the fact "that Paul does not want anyone to think, "that that contentment came from within himself, he adds, "I can do everything through him who gives me strength." Three aspects of the contentment that Paul had, the first one I would like to point out is found in verse 11, and that is that it is acquired over time.
[time=2276] It's acquired over time.
[time=2279] At the time that we trust Jesus Christ as Savior and are born again, there is a great regeneration which takes place inside of us.
[time=2287] The Holy Spirit comes, takes up residence within us, and we are filled with that Holy Spirit, with great power for living and contentment.
[time=2295] And yes, we can feel contentment, enjoy, and peace on that very moment when we are born again.
[time=2303] But the type of strong and rugged, persevering contentment that Paul is speaking about here, the one that takes us through the tough times of life, Paul says is learned or acquired over time.
[time=2316] It didn't just happen in a quick moment of time.
[time=2320] Paul says, "I have learned." The one word there that I think is important is that word that's translated learned.
[time=2328] The idea there is that it is learned over time.
[time=2332] It is learned over a period of time in life.
[time=2336] The apostle Paul was saying that through the trials and tribulations and the troubles of life, through all of the things that have come my way, as I have walked for Jesus Christ in my daily life, as I have trusted in him, I have learned that if I am obedient to him, and I take him at his word, and I test him in those times of struggle, he's faithful, and he's shown me that.
[time=2362] And for that, I have a contentment that no one can take away.
[time=2367] The apostle Paul was giving a great teaching.
[time=2372] He said, "I have the kind of contentment "that does not depend upon situations.
[time=2377] "Indeed, I have learned to be content." How had Paul learned it?
[time=2382] He had learned it through determination, through obedience to the word, through diligence, through practice.
[time=2389] But as he had walked with Christ, that contentment had grown.
[time=2393] And by this point in the apostle's life, nothing was gonna come his way that could shake his confidence, his contentment in Christ.
[time=2403] He said he had learned it over time.
[time=2406] This past week, the staff had the opportunity to go up to Dallas Lake for our staff retreat.
[time=2412] We went up and we planned a lot.
[time=2414] Spent a lot of time mapping out the programs and things that will take place in the church over the next several months who had a good time of fellowship as we did that.
[time=2423] But I realized very quickly after I got up there with them that they were all looking forward to going water skiing the next afternoon.
[time=2431] Now, I have never water skied in my life and I was slightly apprehensive as to what it would be like to go water skiing that next afternoon.
[time=2439] We got up the next morning, went about our job of planning and discussing and philosophizing about the various affairs of the church, but pretty soon it came time for a break and then it was time to water ski.
[time=2451] It was gonna be time to go out and do the lake.
[time=2454] (audience laughs) Now I have, you know, I do lunch.
[time=2458] I do coffee.
[time=2461] I don't do lakes.
[time=2463] (audience laughs) Well, the staff went out and I was immediately overwhelmed because Tim Teder, I quickly nicknamed him Mr. Cypress Gardens.
[time=2471] This guy was wonderful.
[time=2473] One ski, not two, doing all kinds of things.
[time=2476] He just sailed all over the lake smoothly.
[time=2478] I was impressed, but I also became more apprehensive.
[time=2482] I had never water skied, but I knew I was gonna have to that day.
[time=2485] Well, the rest of the staff got up and they all did great.
[time=2488] They just all got up the first time and they were out there skiing and finally it came my turn.
[time=2494] Well, I died over the side of the boat to swim out to the rope and, you know, I've heard that it takes 10 or 15 minutes to get up for the first time.
[time=2502] Well, after the first 15 minutes, I did have one ski on, was getting ready to put on the second one.
[time=2508] What would happen was I had one ski on and it was making me float and I couldn't get my foot up to get the other one on.
[time=2514] But Tim, being the encourager, over the side of the boat, came out, helped me get the second ski on.
[time=2520] Then Tim began to give me some instructions.
[time=2523] Bend your knees, lean back, hold your arms out straight.
[time=2526] Let the boat pull you up, it's no problem.
[time=2530] (audience laughs) 15 attempts later.
[time=2534] (audience laughs) I wasn't up yet.
[time=2537] I finally swam back to the boat and gave up.
[time=2540] Then they continued.
[time=2543] I decided, if Steve Longbrake can do it, I can do it.
[time=2546] (audience laughs) Back into the water I went.
[time=2549] This time I got into the skis much quicker.
[time=2551] I was already learning.
[time=2553] Got up, they continued to shout instructions like move your tongue over to the other side of your mouth.
[time=2558] (audience laughs) All kinds of meaningful things that would help.
[time=2562] I tried it, it must affect 25 more times.
[time=2565] That night when I went to dinner, I couldn't lift up my fork.
[time=2567] (audience laughs) I finally swam back to the boat.
[time=2572] I felt bad, I apologized to the rest of the guys and said, "I'm sorry, I took up all of your recreational time "for me to learn how to ski." Steve said, "Jim, don't worry about it.
[time=2581] "It was tremendous entertainment.
[time=2582] "Just watching you make a fool yourself." (audience laughs) I never did learn how to ski that day.
[time=2588] I never got up, but I'm gonna tell ya, I'm gonna do it.
[time=2591] And when I do, I'll report back to you at some time in the future.
[time=2595] My point is this, there are certain things that I needed to do to learn how to ski.
[time=2601] I needed to listen to the instructions.
[time=2604] I needed to learn to be obedient to them.
[time=2607] I needed to diligently work at it and practice to try to develop a level of ability on the skis.
[time=2614] I needed to diligently, in a determined way, stay with it.
[time=2619] And I will, and at some later time, I'll learn how to ski.
[time=2623] Think that in a way illustrates what Paul is saying here.
[time=2626] When Paul says, "I have learned the secret of being content." I've learned it over time.
[time=2632] Through diligence, through obedience, through faithfulness.
[time=2636] I've taken God through the trials of life, and He's been faithful.
[time=2641] No one can take it away.
[time=2643] Oh, if you're a new believer here this morning, and you're struggling with a lack of contentment in your life.
[time=2648] If you've been a believer for years, and you're struggling with a lack of contentment in your life, I challenge you this morning to walk closer with the Lord.
[time=2656] Be obedient to His word, trust in Him, diligently practice that.
[time=2661] Paul says that we can learn to be content, to have a contentment that no one can take away from us.
[time=2669] But that's just the first point.
[time=2670] Let's move on.
[time=2671] In the next verse, Paul gives us this.
[time=2673] First of all, it's acquired over time.
[time=2675] Secondly, it's available in all circumstances, verse 11.
[time=2680] Paul says, "I am not saying this because I am in need, "for I have learned to be content "whatever the circumstances." The Apostle Paul knew that he had had times in his life of serving Christ.
[time=2693] When he had had plenty of food, plenty of money, because of the contributions that had been made to his ministry, there had been times when all of his material needs had been met.
[time=2703] The Apostle Paul also knew that there had been times when his material needs had gone wanting.
[time=2708] In fact, he had gone hungry, he had struggled for food.
[time=2712] There had been times when in his ministry he had been praised by men for his great preaching, but there had been time when he had been stoned and taken out of the city and left for dead.
[time=2721] The Apostle Paul said, "In all of those circumstances, "that same contentment was available to me, "and I seized it, and I'm content today." The Apostle Paul had a contentment that worked in all circumstances.
[time=2737] This morning, you may be going through one of those trials of life that the Apostle Paul went through.
[time=2742] It may be a trial that's peculiar to your situation, but Paul says, "Walk with God, trust in him, "and no matter what circumstances come your way, "whether they be good or bad, you can have contentment." You know, at first, when I read that verse, I thought to myself, "Well, that's easy for Paul to say." God, that's easy for Paul to say.
[time=2763] Because, you know, in our society, we're taught that unless you have certain things, contentment doesn't come.
[time=2771] If you watch television, you hear the commercials, and they tell us that if we work hard, and we can finally build a bigger and better house, that one day in that bigger house, we'll find contentment.
[time=2782] And then we get that big house and contentment doesn't come.
[time=2786] And the advertisers will tell us that if we work hard and progress, we'll be able to buy a more and more expensive car and all that car.
[time=2794] The final step up, that will bring contentment, and then we get there and we find out that it doesn't bring contentment.
[time=2802] Solomon found it out.
[time=2804] Millions have found out through the ages that gaining things does not bring contentment, the true contentment that lasts in the times of struggle.
[time=2815] For our human nature is that when we get something, our nature is to want more, to not be satisfied, but to always want more.
[time=2824] It's not long before we're wanting something more and something more.
[time=2827] Paul says that will never bring contentment, but Christ will, whether you have little or whether you have a lot.
[time=2834] We're never satisfied.
[time=2837] This past two weeks we went on vacation, and it was a great time on vacation, but one of the days Linda and I woke up and said we were gonna make this the boy's day.
[time=2847] We were gonna give them everything they wanted to make this their day on vacation.
[time=2852] Well, we took them out and the first thing we did was take them for breakfast where they wanted to go.
[time=2856] Where would they want to go?
[time=2858] Need I even ask?
[time=2859] McDonald's.
[time=2860] We went to McDonald's for breakfast.
[time=2862] Then we decided we were gonna take them to the nicest, what we think is the nicest water park in all of Florida.
[time=2867] And it was a great time.
[time=2869] We got there early and the boys went in and they just had a great time running around all morning on the giant slides, the giant flumes and the waterfalls and the places where you just dive off into the deep water.
[time=2879] Oh, it was great and they were enjoying it.
[time=2882] And then lunchtime came.
[time=2883] They didn't want to eat at the place where we were staying.
[time=2886] And so we took them wherever they wanted to go, obviously wherever they wanted to go.
[time=2891] We went there, brought our lunch, and then decided we would go back and let them have the rest of the afternoon at this beautiful lots of fun water park.
[time=2900] Well, they went back and they just had a great time.
[time=2903] Well, finally we were all worn out and burnt from the sun and we decided it was time to leave and well, where do the boys want to go to dinner?
[time=2910] After we left there we stopped at one of the little shopping malls on the way back to the condominium and my son Drew wanted a book that he saw.
[time=2922] It was a good book about a nice Christian athlete and I bought it for him and said, Drew, don't ask for anything.
[time=2929] The rest of the time we're on vacation.
[time=2932] He said, okay, I won't.
[time=2934] Drove back to the condominium and stopped at this little gas station.
[time=2938] And as I turned off the engine to go get gas, the first thing both of my boys said was, can we get candy?
[time=2943] I said, no, you've had enough today.
[time=2947] Nine-year-old folds his arms across his chest.
[time=2951] We never get anything.
[time=2953] (audience laughs) Four-year-old looks at his older brother, folds his arms across his chest and says, we never get anything.
[time=2961] Then they looked at me a few moments later and I could tell that they weren't real happy.
[time=2965] But you know, that's what happens.
[time=2968] The more we get, the more we want.
[time=2971] Contentment becomes harder and harder to come by.
[time=2975] Well, the Apostle Paul had it right, but he said that it's available in all circumstances.
[time=2981] You know, I believe the Bible teaches us that our goal should not be to have much, but it should be to be much.
[time=2988] God is not worried or concerned about the things that we have.
[time=2993] God is concerned about our character.
[time=2996] God is concerned about the type of person that we are and how we're serving him.
[time=3001] Bill Heibels is one of my favorite authors and he has written a great book.
[time=3006] And from that book, he says this.
[time=3008] Character, a wise person once said, is what we do when no one is looking.
[time=3014] It's not the same as reputation.
[time=3016] What other people think of us.
[time=3018] It is not the same as success or achievement.
[time=3021] Character is not what we have done but who we are.
[time=3026] The Apostle Paul knew a secret of contentment.
[time=3030] It worked in any and all circumstances.
[time=3033] It was not in achieving all of the material things of life.
[time=3037] It came from serving Jesus Christ on a daily basis, walking with him over time.
[time=3044] And the contentment was Paul's.
[time=3046] No matter what might come his way.
[time=3048] Are you struggling with the circumstances of life this morning?
[time=3051] Oh, we all do from time to time.
[time=3054] But if you're struggling with the circumstances of life, I would challenge this morning to walk with Christ.
[time=3060] Trust him.
[time=3061] He is sufficient.
[time=3062] He will bring contentment in any and all circumstances.
[time=3066] Whether they be days of having little or days of having much.
[time=3070] The Apostle Paul knew the contentment that Christ could give.
[time=3075] But then lastly, for our last point this morning, the Apostle Paul goes on, as I said at the beginning, I think Paul did not want anyone reading to think that perhaps this contentment had come with his own strength.
[time=3088] And so the Apostle Paul put down verse 13.
[time=3091] He said, I can do everything through him who gives me strength.
[time=3096] In the King James version it says, I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me.
[time=3102] My third point is that this contentment is available only through Christ.
[time=3108] The Apostle Paul knew that it was only through Christ and through his profound trust in him that he had the confidence and the contentment and the power for living that he had.
[time=3121] The Apostle Paul knew that it would only be through the strength of Christ that he could make it.
[time=3128] Now let's not misunderstand.
[time=3130] Paul is not saying here that God could turn him into some kind of cosmic Superman.
[time=3134] He's not saying that through Christ he could do all things.
[time=3137] Therefore he could run the 100-yard dash in nine seconds flat.
[time=3140] That's not what he was saying.
[time=3141] Paul was not saying that because Christ could-- he could do all things through Christ, that he could long jump 35 feet.
[time=3147] No, that's not what he was saying.
[time=3149] But what Paul was really saying was not a statement of self-sufficiency or great human achievement.
[time=3155] It was a statement of God-sufficiency.
[time=3159] And what Paul was saying was this.
[time=3161] I can face all of the situations of life-- pain, persecution, poverty, illness, and still maintain a positive perspective on life.
[time=3174] My contentment does not depend upon men.
[time=3177] It depends upon Christ.
[time=3181] Did Paul know that contentment?
[time=3184] Oh, yes, he certainly did.
[time=3187] Paul wrote in 1 Timothy, God was his great enabler.
[time=3191] In 2 Timothy, he wrote that God was a helper standing by him
[time=3197] daily.
[time=3199] In 2 Corinthians, he wrote that when his strength failed, God's strength was there to pick him up.
[time=3206] Yes, the great apostle had trusted in Christ, had that contentment, knew that his source of power was Jesus Christ and Christ alone.
[time=3216] Paul said, I don't stand alone.
[time=3219] He is there.
[time=3220] His power is my source of contentment.
[time=3224] Several hundred years ago, a great man by the name of Martin Luther, who almost single-handedly launched the Protestant Reformation.
[time=3232] Martin Luther stood before a church council.
[time=3237] Luther, through his own study of the Bible, had come across the doctrine of justification by faith alone, that we are saved only through our faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3246] And he had began to write about that and to speak about that and that had gotten him in trouble with the church to which he belonged.
[time=3254] But Luther, when he was called before them to answer for this, Luther was strong.
[time=3261] The papal legate who questioned him said, Luther, we don't want to argue, we're not here to debate.
[time=3268] All we want you to do is take back what you've said, recant of what you've said, go back to the monastery, live the rest of your life.
[time=3278] Just do it and everything will be forgotten.
[time=3282] But Luther knew that he couldn't do that.
[time=3285] Luther knew that he believed what he believed.
[time=3288] He also knew that the God that he served would deliver him one of two ways.
[time=3293] He would either deliver him from death or he would deliver him through death for Martin Luther knew that he would either be at the least excommunicated, at the worst, imprisoned, or even burned at the stake.
[time=3307] But Martin Luther stood firm.
[time=3309] And when they asked him one last time to recant, Luther said this, he said, I will not recant anything.
[time=3317] For to go against my conscience is neither right nor safe.
[time=3323] I cannot and I will not recant anything.
[time=3327] Here I stand.
[time=3329] May God help me.
[time=3331] Martin Luther, the apostle Paul, Dave Dravicki, you and I,
[time=3338] all have the same power for living that comes from our relationship with Jesus Christ and knowing that from him we can learn to be content, that it is available to us under any circumstances.
[time=3352] And because of that and the power of Christ, we can live for him.
[time=3356] Let me leave you with one final thought this morning, one final application.
[time=3362] We can trust in Christ in this life.
[time=3364] We can have the contentment that we have.
[time=3367] And it's a wonderful piece and contentment that we can have deep within our heart.
[time=3371] We can clutch it, hold onto it, and no one can ever take it away from us.
[time=3377] But I believe the Bible teaches that that contentment, as great as it can be, is merely a foretaste, merely a foretaste of what will one day be.
[time=3389] It is merely a foretaste.
[time=3393] The banquet is going to be in heaven.
[time=3396] The banquet one day will be in heaven.
[time=3399] And then we will have the perfect contentment, the perfect contentment, as we spend all of eternity with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, having trusted in him, walked with him in this life.
[time=3413] Are you struggling today with contentment in your life?
[time=3418] Are you struggling as a believer, or perhaps as an unbeliever today, struggling with contentment?
[time=3423] There are trials and tribulations that are tearing you apart inside.
[time=3428] The Apostle Paul says from the words of Scripture, come to Jesus Christ.
[time=3432] Learn the secret of being content.
[time=3434] Learn the secret of the power for living that can be yours today.

[time=3488] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
