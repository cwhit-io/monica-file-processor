[time=1236] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1240] Thank you very much for your participation in music.
[time=1243] It sounds wonderful to hear you singing together with the choir and congregation joining together. That's great.
[time=1250] We have a great special guest with us today.
[time=1252] We've been announcing it for a number of weeks.
[time=1254] Gary McSpeddon has sung across the country.
[time=1257] We've heard him many times in our own Colosseum here in Fort Wayne when he was with the Gather Trio and later the Gather Vocal Band.
[time=1264] He's a wonderful man of God that has a great message, a great song to sing.
[time=1268] We're glad that he's able to be with us this morning and then for our patriotic panorama this afternoon.
[time=1273] Let's give a good Black Hawk welcome to Mr. Gary McSpeddon.
[time=1276] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1280] Thank you very much. Thank you, Peter.
[time=1283] So good to be here in this great church.
[time=1285] You've heard about it for many years and it's my first opportunity to be with you today.
[time=1289] It is great to come into a place like this, a beautiful room and realize that the Spirit of the Lord is here.
[time=1295] On this Sunday which is just before our Independence Day celebration.
[time=1300] We have to remember that the greatest independence that all of us have experienced if we know Christ is the independence of our soul freed from the bondage of sin.
[time=1308] And Jesus is promised to come into this place with us where we are gathered in His name on a morning like this, to meet with us, to touch us and to change us, and to move us closer to Himself, and to make a difference in our lives if we will only let Him.
[time=1324] He is here with us this morning.
[time=1326] In this very room, there's quite enough love for one like Him.
[time=1339] Yes, in this very room, there's quite enough joy
[time=1348] for one like Him.
[time=1352] And there's quite enough hope and quite enough power
[time=1359] to change the way of the years.
[time=1367] Jesus, my Lord Jesus, Jesus is here in this very room.
[time=1389] But it doesn't come into a place like this for just one of us this morning.
[time=1393] Not when we're gathered in His name, in this very room,
[time=1399] there's quite enough love for us.
[time=1408] Yes, in this very room, there's quite enough joy,
[time=1416] joy for all of us, and there is quite enough hope
[time=1424] and quite enough power to change the way of the years.
[time=1435] Jesus, my Lord Jesus, Jesus is here in this very room.
[time=1457] And if you really believe that He's here in this place with us this morning, then we can't keep what we find in this room inside these walls when there's a world outside that's lost in dying and needs to know that in this very room, there's quite enough love for one.
[time=1479] Yes, in this very room, there's quite enough joy,
[time=1486] joy for the world, and there's quite enough hope
[time=1494] and quite enough power to change the way of the world.
[time=1509] Right here in this place this morning with us, there's enough power and joy and hope and love to chase away the gloom of all the world.
[time=1518] Because the King of Kings, Jesus the Master, the Savior has chosen to come here
[time=1524] indeed with us, where we have gathered in His name.
[time=1528] All my friend, we can touch in this morning, and we're in the place where He can touch us.
[time=1533] So let's reach for Him as He reaches back to us.
[time=1537] Jesus is here, He's in this very room.
[time=1544] Thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour today.
[time=1558] For a number of weeks we've been talking about our annual Patriotic Panorama, and on the Bible Hour today we have our special guest, Gary McSpadden.
[time=1567] You just heard him sing, and he'll be singing a little bit later in our program, and then we'll be giving the message.
[time=1572] We're glad that he's here, and we're glad that we have the opportunity to say that we believe in America.
[time=1578] Along with millions of citizens that came across and braved the storm he sees, my ancestors came and established their home right here in Indiana.
[time=1587] It was a home where they believed in God and established the fact that they wanted to worship Him and live for Him faithfully.
[time=1594] And I'm glad for that.
[time=1595] I'm glad that we have the freedom right here in America to worship the Lord as we please.
[time=1600] I do believe in America.
[time=1603] In the next coming weeks we're going to have some special speakers, and I'd like to announce them to you.
[time=1608] I hope that you will tune in each week for the Bible Hour.
[time=1611] Next week we'll have our Associate Pastor, Jim Pearson speaking.
[time=1615] He has spoken before, and he will be here on next Sunday on the Bible Hour.
[time=1620] And then for the following two weeks we will have Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1624] Dr. Nichols is the Director of the Live Counseling Center in San Diego, California.
[time=1630] He also is a former member of our staff right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1635] On his first Sunday with us he'll be talking about the New Age movement, and then the second Sunday he will be talking about fears and how to alleviate fear in our lives.
[time=1646] I hope that you will continue to let us know that you are watching the Bible Hour and will be faithful in receiving inspiration from it.
[time=1654] And then I want to talk to you about a new gift offer.
[time=1657] We have been giving you some books and booklets to receive, and this month we have a cassette.
[time=1663] It's a study on the book of James entitled "Dina Moments" with Dr. Warren Wiersby.
[time=1669] Dr. Wiersby has been a member of the Radio Bible Class radio program for a number of years, and has written this book of James the study of the book of James.
[time=1680] This cassette is a great study in the trials and temptations that Christians go through.
[time=1686] It seems that in the study of the book of James that people were having trouble living the life that they profess to believe.
[time=1693] Sounds familiar for this day and age.
[time=1695] So I'm telling you today that this is a great study in the book of James and is very practical for your Christian living.
[time=1703] I hope that you'll write for this cassette today.
[time=1705] Write to us at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1716] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1726] When you write to us, just tell us that you're watching the Bible Hour and then ask for this gift offer.
[time=1731] We are really encouraged when you do write and tell us that you're watching faithfully and have received inspiration from our program.
[time=1738] We're going back to the live portion of our service now and enjoy the musical ministry of Gary Mcspadden.
[time=1752] [SILENCE]
[time=1764] This morning is a very special time in the lives of 21 of us who will be leaving very shortly Saturday morning to be exact at 4.30 from the church parking lot headed for Jamaica.
[time=1781] It was last January that this group of people began the preparation for this trip.
[time=1789] This morning we want to be able to say thank you to all of you who have had a very major part in our going to represent you and the Lord Jesus Christ in the nation of Jamaica.
[time=1803] As I looked at the records this last week, over 300 people have given, have indicated that they will be praying specifically for us as we go and as we represent Blackhawk in this coming two week period.
[time=1820] Thank you.
[time=1825] We are delighted today to present these people to our church and we want to take a moment and just ask God's blessing
[time=1831] on their ministry in Jamaica.
[time=1833] As you recall a couple years ago when we went there we established some churches we want to strengthen those churches and we just trust that God will use these people mightily as they show forth the love of God as representatives of our Lord and Savior in a Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1849] Let's just bow in prayer please.
[time=1852] Our Father we come before you and we just quiet our hearts now and thank you that you are our Savior
[time=1858] and that we know you as a personal Savior and we've accepted you and you've told us to go and teach and preach to all nations.
[time=1867] Today we are grateful for these people who have committed their lives to spend this extra time as laymen
[time=1873] to go to Jamaica and to minister there.
[time=1876] We pray that you'll already be preparing the hearts of the people that will hear the message and that they'll respond with gladness to the great gift of eternal life and we pray for everyone on our team that you will just watch over and care for them and you'll give them boldness and courage to witness for you and we pray that you will keep them strong and healthy physically.
[time=1897] They might have an enjoyable time in one where they'll anticipate the joy of the Lord as they minister.
[time=1903] Give them a oneness as they go from here this week and we pray that your work will be done and the honor and glory will be given to you.
[time=1911] Thank you for Dick Kelly and his preparation and the work that he's done in leading this team.
[time=1916] Please bless them in a special way this week.
[time=1919] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1924] In a moment I'm going to ask Gary McSpadden to come back and sing for us and then he's going to preach from God's Word.
[time=1931] Tell us a little bit about his ministries.
[time=1933] Again, I want to encourage you to bring your friends and join with us as we minister this afternoon in the patriotic panorama.
[time=1940] It's a delight to have you here, Gary, the Lord bless you as you minister again to us.
[time=1945] Thank you so much, Peter.
[time=1948] It's good to be here today and my wife Carol is with me.
[time=1951] She's upstairs.
[time=1952] I'll introduce her to you this afternoon and we'll share a little bit together.
[time=1956] I hope you are planning to come back this afternoon at four o'clock.
[time=1960] I was moved by this.
[time=1963] I have been involved in missions most of my life in various ways.
[time=1967] I was just a kid when I first went to Jamaica with my parents who were ministers and we spent time there and in Haiti and Cuba.
[time=1975] About a month of my life was spent there and it turned my heart toward missions.
[time=1979] Just to share a little bit about what Peter was talking about, Carol and I, many of you know as he said I was with the Gather Trio.
[time=1985] How many of us saw us with the Gather Trio and the Gather Vocal Band?
[time=1988] Oh, many of you.
[time=1989] I've been away from the Gathers for about a year and a half now.
[time=1992] Carol and I prayed for a long time about God's moving in our heart concerning that.
[time=1997] We felt like it was time to leave.
[time=1999] Carol and Gloria had been a great 11 years but I'd carried them about as far as I could and that was up to them to try to make it on their own.
[time=2006] I think they might do all right.
[time=2009] They're good Indiana folks.
[time=2010] We'll probably go by and see them tomorrow and our way back down to Indianapolis.
[time=2013] And it is a joy to be here.
[time=2016] Carol and I spent two weeks in New York City last summer on the streets and God stirred our hearts while we were there working with unfortunate people and spending time there and this year he's moved us more into missions.
[time=2028] September will be back in New York.
[time=2030] In October will be in Haiti and in November the day after Thanksgiving heading for Romania to minister the Word of God and to sing and to tell people about Jesus.
[time=2038] And I think that's the mission for all of us.
[time=2041] I think the thing that we must do is realize that the power of the Lord rests upon us by His Holy Spirit so that we might go tell the world.
[time=2048] And maybe it's just a small world for you and for some of us it's a larger world but we all have that same commission to go and to tell and to spread the gospel.
[time=2057] This morning at the conclusion of this service I will be out in the lobby.
[time=2060] I'd love to shake hands with those of you who are not going to be able particularly to be back here this afternoon at four o'clock.
[time=2065] We're going to have a wonderful time. It's going to be a very very special time and I hope you'll be able to be back.
[time=2070] Those of you who cannot come back and would like to be a participant in our ministry.
[time=2074] We're funding our Romania trip and our Haiti trip by some of our tape sales and we have those in the lobby and I'll explain to you how you can get a free tape this morning and order some others and help us go on this missions project that we believe God is sending us on.
[time=2088] And I believe there are other things for many of us to do.
[time=2090] You know the one thing that I grew up learning my dad is a minister.
[time=2093] I grew up learning that the witness does not have to take place always from the pool pit.
[time=2097] That it can take place almost anywhere.
[time=2099] My dad used to witness to those highway patrolmen who used to stop him as he drove too fast.
[time=2103] And folks like that you know are back at the service station you know when my dad would pull up the service station.
[time=2109] Now this is back when they did something for the money at the service station.
[time=2112] You know what I'm saying the guy would come out and you know fill this car with gas and wash the windshield and he would invariably talk to those folks wherever he went in the grocery store and whatever else he might be doing.
[time=2123] He always found a way to tell people that Jesus loved them.
[time=2126] And sometimes I think that maybe we don't know all the theology.
[time=2129] We don't know all the right answers.
[time=2130] We don't know all the things that we might need to know but I'll tell you this.
[time=2133] You can say with the blind man in the Bible who once said I don't know how it happened.
[time=2137] I only know that once I was blind now I can see.
[time=2141] And that may be your testimony.
[time=2143] So don't ask me to explain for you how one can start again.
[time=2151] How hardened hearts can soften like a child.
[time=2159] And don't ask me how to reason out the mysteries of life.
[time=2169] How to face life's problems with a smile.
[time=2175] Here's what you do my friend.
[time=2177] Go ask the man who's found a way through tangled rose back home to stay when all communications were destroyed.
[time=2195] Go ask the child who's walking now who once was crippled.
[time=2202] Then somehow her useless legs were made to jump for joy.
[time=2212] Go ask the one who's burned out high has been restored.
[time=2218] I think you'll find the questions not important as before.
[time=2229] Don't ask me if he's good or bad.
[time=2233] I only know the guilt I had is gone.
[time=2239] And I can't tell you anymore.
[time=2246] And don't ask me how to prove to you why I know God is there.
[time=2255] And how I know that he could care for you.
[time=2263] And don't ask me why someone so great would choose to walk with me.
[time=2271] And trade my broken life or one that's new.
[time=2282] Just go ask the child who's got a dead to love away the herd he had before this man called Jesus touched their lives.
[time=2296] Go ask the one whose fears had fled whose churning heart was quieted when someone whispered peace to all her strife.
[time=2313] Go ask the man to tell you more whose life was just a raging war and silence him until the Savior came.
[time=2330] I don't pretend to be so wise I only know he touched my eyes and nothing else will ever be the same.
[time=2361] Oh no, nothing else will ever be the same.
[time=2374] [AMEN] It is a joy to be, excuse me, I need to turn this on.
[time=2386] Is this one on on front here? I knew I was going to forget to do that.
[time=2393] If you're not hearing me, thank you very much Peter for allowing me to speak from this pulpit this morning.
[time=2403] It is a joy always to open the Word of God.
[time=2406] I have my Bible open to Proverbs 16-18 and it is a scripture that I believe we can find some truth in this morning.
[time=2415] And then another scripture in Jeremiah, the 18th chapter, the first for the fourth verses.
[time=2420] Minister once said the greatness of a man is to be found in the measure of his surrender.
[time=2427] William Booth of the Salvation Army summed it up in this way.
[time=2432] When asked about the phenomenal growth of the Salvation Army, the group that he founded, he simply said God has had all of me.
[time=2441] Now if we want to look at submission to God, I believe God is not looking for men and women who have greatness of stature in terms of economic wealth.
[time=2451] God is not looking for people with great personalities.
[time=2454] God is looking for people who are simply totally yielded to his will, instruments with which he can work.
[time=2461] In this day and age in which everything seems to be immediate fulfillment, instant gratification,
[time=2468] we have to look at the Word of God and we'll find some truths in Proverbs 16 verse 18.
[time=2473] Pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.
[time=2479] Now the same principle is emphasized in 1 John 2 and 16 where it is said for all that is in the world,
[time=2486] the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world.
[time=2493] The Lord Jesus included a proud spirit in his list of sins which stem from the evil heart of man and in the same breath he linked pride with conceit, covetousness, wickedness, blasphemy, murders and on and on in Mark 7.
[time=2506] In the beginning of chapter 3 in Luke's Gospel I find some things that we might look at, that we might see ourselves in along the way.
[time=2513] The names that are being mentioned in Luke chapter 3 are names of great men of Scripture,
[time=2519] Tiberius Caesar the Roman Emperor, Pontius Pilate the governor of Judea, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee,
[time=2526] Philip the tetrarch of Iteria, Anasen, Caiaphas the high priest, all leaders among the people of their day.
[time=2534] The world's greatest and most brutal empire was at that time intact.
[time=2539] These men were leaders of that empire but God ready to begin a new work in the earth passed over all these men
[time=2547] that were great in the eyes of the people.
[time=2550] We live in a nation today that is the greatest nation on the face of the earth and yet we have seen in the last few weeks and months what I believe is the hand of God at work in this world.
[time=2561] I could never have thought to have seen what has happened since last fall, have transpired and just as late as yesterday I suppose or this morning possibly,
[time=2572] Germany is now one nation again, the iron curtain has fallen, their Berlin wall is down, all these things that are transpiring so quickly says to me that God is doing a work
[time=2583] and it is July 4th coming up and we look at Independence Day and we think of this nation and we think of the greatness of the nation
[time=2589] and then we look back at the Roman Empire and we realize that although there were great men and great leaders and the empire was probably the greatest of all the world as far as control of the world that was known at that time,
[time=2601] God passed over all the men that were in that great leadership and he went to an obscure man in the wilderness of Judea.
[time=2610] God's not looking for a wealthy man, God's not particularly looking for a mighty man, God's not looking for a talented man or a man of great wealth or personality or natural gifts,
[time=2622] God is looking for a vessel that is totally yielded to himself, yielded submissive and of a broken and contrite spirit.
[time=2632] Let's take a look at John the Baptist who was one of these men that God reached for.
[time=2637] If John the Baptist had wanted to speak of himself he could have done so very easily, for he had done some wonderful things in his life and God had touched him in a very unique way.
[time=2646] He could have said the Old Testament had prophesied of his ministry.
[time=2649] He could have said he was the immediate forerunner of the Messiah to introduce Christ to the nation of Israel.
[time=2654] He was an Azerite, a very holy person from infancy.
[time=2657] Jesus had said of him among all the men of the world that existed.
[time=2662] There had not risen a greater man than John the Baptist.
[time=2665] He had been given his name John by an angel before he was born.
[time=2669] He was the messenger to prepare the people for the coming of the king.
[time=2673] Yet here was John the Baptist, the man who could have said all these things of himself, but rather than speak of himself, he simply said to those who question him, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness." And he pointed to the Lord Jesus Christ saying, "He must increase, and I must decrease."
[time=2692] Another in the New Testament of kindred spirit to John the Baptist is Paul, sometimes known as Saul of Tarsus.
[time=2699] When on that Damascus road that day, he began to see the beauty of Jesus, and he was never the same again.
[time=2705] I'm here to tell you something this morning.
[time=2707] If you see Jesus, you'll never be the same again.
[time=2710] If Paul had been so disposed and his spirit had been one of ego and bragging, he could have said a lot of things about himself.
[time=2717] He'd gone through all the required Jewish ceremonies in his infancy.
[time=2721] He was of the stock of Israel.
[time=2723] He was of the tribe of Benjamin, the best love of the tribes.
[time=2726] He was the Hebrew of the Hebrews, one with status and importance in the nation.
[time=2730] He was a Pharisee, one of the leading religious bodies, the Orthodox faith, believing in the coming of the Messiah.
[time=2736] He lived his life above reproach in that he had kept the law as few of them in had kept it.
[time=2741] But in all these things that Paul had done, he gloried not in himself.
[time=2745] He found that to be of little worth or of no value.
[time=2748] He valued only what Christ had done.
[time=2751] Today's culture calls for instant gratification, immediate satisfaction, but submission and surrender seeks long range objectives.
[time=2758] And in our lives, if we are to do what God is calling us to do, if this nation is to remain great, if we are to be the people of God, then we have to do what God has called us to do, which is submit to him and be yielded with our daily lives, daily dying to sin.
[time=2774] And it comes down to a decision.
[time=2776] I think of Moses, and I think of the decision he had to make.
[time=2779] He had to make a choice, which road to follow, which course to go on.
[time=2783] Let's look at his choice.
[time=2785] By faith, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[time=2789] By faith, he chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[time=2797] By faith, he esteemed the reproach of Christ, greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt.
[time=2804] No one who totally comes to God in submission comes out on the short end of choosing, my friend.
[time=2810] If you'll choose the will of God in your life, if you'll find that God, what God wants you to do, and follow that as your course that you choose, you'll always be right.
[time=2820] Let's go on a short journey for just a moment.
[time=2823] Down with an ancient prophet to the house of the potter, in Jeremiah 18, we'll find these scriptures, the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying, "Arise and go to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words." Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrote a work on the wheels, and the vessel that was made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter.
[time=2844] So he made it again, another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
[time=2849] As Jeremiah walked down that street to the potter's house and stood in the doorway, we stand beside him this morning and we watch.
[time=2856] And as he watched this potter work to the work on the wheels, as the Bible says, it was a serious work, work with a purpose.
[time=2864] The potter with his wheeled and the clay in his hands and in the potter's mind a purpose.
[time=2870] The clay doesn't know the purpose.
[time=2872] Jeremiah didn't know the purpose.
[time=2874] The wheel didn't know the purpose, only the potter knows the purpose.
[time=2878] And I think for us, with hands of clay, that God begins to take us and shape us and form us.
[time=2884] And I realize that sometimes it's not a pleasant experience, but still God does His perfect work and His perfect will in our lives.
[time=2892] Those that refuse to be molded by the potter's hand are cast away, discards in the potter's field.
[time=2899] But those who are submissive and totally, completely, continually yielded to the hand of the potter,
[time=2905] to the hand of the master, will be used in His glory and for goodness.
[time=2911] With His purpose in mind, that's how He molds us this morning.
[time=2914] That's how He begins the work in our lives.
[time=2917] I believe in great families because great families make great churches.
[time=2921] Great families make great nations.
[time=2925] Great families are what this life is all about, my friend.
[time=2929] We have two children.
[time=2930] Carol and I have been married a number of years.
[time=2932] Sean has tried to play baseball and basketball and football and all these different kinds of sports that he's been in.
[time=2939] And along the way, he wanted to play Little League.
[time=2942] He moved to Nashville, Tennessee from down in Texas about 11 years ago, 12 years ago.
[time=2947] And he was just a kid about 11, 12 years old and he kept begging us to play ball.
[time=2951] And finally, we kept saying we can't.
[time=2952] We just don't have the time.
[time=2953] You know, they play 78 practices a week in 5,000 games every week or something like that in Little League.
[time=2959] I don't know, it's just ridiculous.
[time=2961] Finally, we signed him up for it after he begged and pleaded.
[time=2964] And I went to all those practice games like a good dad does and they won 10 in a row.
[time=2970] Sean was chosen to be pitcher in first baseman.
[time=2972] He's a left-hander, a good kid, a good throwing, a left arm, you know.
[time=2976] I was proud of him.
[time=2978] And I figured we'd win all 14 games in the regular season.
[time=2982] Well, we lost the first one though.
[time=2984] I was kind of pumped still.
[time=2985] I thought, well, we'll win the rest of them.
[time=2987] Then we lost the second and the third and the fourth and the fifth.
[time=2991] In fact, we lost 13 in a row out of the 14.
[time=2995] I was kind of nervous because Sean was going to pitch this last game.
[time=2999] And we were playing a team that hadn't lost a game all year.
[time=3002] And our team hadn't won a game all year.
[time=3004] And you can kind of see why I was nervous.
[time=3006] I went up to his room before the game and I said, "Sean, are you nervous?" And he said, "No, I'm not nervous, Dad." Well, I was nervous.
[time=3013] I said, "Well, you ready to pitch?" And he said, "Yeah." I said, "You want to pray?" He said, "Yeah, Dad, let's pray." So I bowed my head and he stood beside me and I said, "Lord, thank you for letting Sean play baseball this year.
[time=3027] None of the boys have gotten hurt.
[time=3029] And Lord, don't let anybody get hurt tonight and just let the best team win." When I said that, he went, "Ugh." I knew exactly what he meant.
[time=3040] We went to the game, they warmed up, they looked good, Sean pitched a great game.
[time=3044] It was pretty special.
[time=3046] Because in the fifth inning, they played seven innings and the fifth inning, he had pitched a masterful game.
[time=3050] We're leading nine to five.
[time=3052] I'm doing backflips off the top of the stands.
[time=3054] I'm so excited.
[time=3055] We was going to make our season, we're going to beat this team that hadn't lost a game.
[time=3060] And then he walked a couple of guys in the sixth inning.
[time=3063] A guy hit a homerun, the same thing happened in the seventh, and we lost ten to nine.
[time=3069] And it kind of made a perfect season for both teams.
[time=3071] They won them all, we lost them all.
[time=3074] And the coach had the meeting they have, I don't know what they say, but the coach had a little meeting with the boys.
[time=3079] Set them down, talk to them.
[time=3082] It didn't take long, he probably said, "I don't want to see any of you boys ever again as long as I lay up or something like that." But Sean came back to the car.
[time=3090] And as he made his way back to the car, I could see the weight of the world on his shoulders.
[time=3093] He got to the car, he opened the door and he threw his glove inside, and he sat down and closed the door.
[time=3099] And I said, "Tough loss, buddy." And he just blurted out, "Just a stupid game, I hate this game, I'm never ever playing it again.
[time=3104] I don't care what you say, I'm never playing it again, it's just stupid." I said, "Sean, you can't have that kind of attitude, son." "It's stupid, I hate this game, I'm not ever playing it again. You signed that car, I never signed up for it, I never wanted to play it anyway, you forced me to work."
[time=3119] I got tough with him, I said, "Sean, you can't have that kind of attitude, you did the best you could, but you can't have that kind of attitude about it."
[time=3126] And he looked at me in tears in his eyes and he said, "But dad, I wanted to win that game for you." Well then I cried.
[time=3133] And I put my arms around him, I told him I loved him.
[time=3136] And I told him this, I said, "Sean, look, I want you to win that game more than you wanted to win it, but I couldn't love you anymore if you'd want it, and I wouldn't love you less if you'd lost it."
[time=3147] Because my love doesn't change with winning and losing, I love you because you're my son.
[time=3152] I think God wants us to know something this morning.
[time=3155] I think God wants us to know that his love doesn't change with our lack of submission.
[time=3160] God wants us to know that his love is always consistent. God wants us to submit to him as clay in the potter's hand.
[time=3168] But God's will for us is that we give our lives to him.
[time=3172] God's will is that we turn over everything to him, that the controls are completely his.
[time=3178] Not folks who hold back, but folks who give it all to Jesus and say, "Lord, I'll serve you with my life."
[time=3186] Maybe this sums it up best this morning.
[time=3190] Father, the more you've given me your love and told me, the more my grace is not enough.
[time=3213] Just not enough, Lord. You said you said to me, "He who would go first go last, and so I pray that you'll be first in all I ask."
[time=3238] That's what he wants by praying.
[time=3242] And the highest praise for them spoken words, it's what my heart will say.
[time=3251] All I have to offer you in my song is just to live for you.
[time=3264] Oh, the highest praise not to see, and yet believe you died for me.
[time=3277] Sometimes in the night I thank you silently for all you do.
[time=3291] Yes, and the highest praise that I give today is just to give my life to you.
[time=3318] Sometimes we think if we could just do something great for God, then he'd accept it.
[time=3324] But my friend, all he wants is us and father, your father.
[time=3331] If you had asked for some great thing, don't you know I would have tried, and yet you only wanted me.
[time=3348] You see, that's all he wants, it's just you and me.
[time=3374] Sometimes we always think we have to win, but the highest praise is not to see, and yet believe you died for me.
[time=3387] And sometimes in the night I thank you silently, I thank you Lord for all you do.
[time=3401] And the highest praise that I can give today is just to give my life.
[time=3421] Lord, help me heal my life, I want to give my whole life to you.
[time=3438] Oh yes I do, yes Lord, the highest praise, heal my life for you.
[time=3451] So let's commit this morning to give our lives to Jesus Christ.

[time=3482] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3491] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3499] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3502] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3508] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
