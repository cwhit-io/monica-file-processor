[time=60] Early in elementary school, we learn what antonyms are. Antonyms are opposite words. If I say hot, you say cold. If I say black, you say white. If I say slow, you say fast. But what if I were to say to you faith? What word would you pick to be the opposite of that word? Perhaps after a moment, you might say doubt.
[time=87] But our faith and doubt truly opposite words. Or is it possible that faith and doubt can coexist in the life of the believer at the same time? Today let's deal with those nagging doubts.
[time=104] [MUSIC]
[time=114] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us. Associate Pastor Jim Pearson will be bringing a message he has entitled, dealing with those nagging doubts. We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=132] Special music today includes songs from celebration and lin roll.
[time=162] [MUSIC]
[time=166] From the start, you held a place in my heart, a place that no one else could feel.
[time=178] Sing kept your spirit from working with me. I couldn't look at life honestly. Until the day my will gave away to the truth that I found in you.
[time=203] I never knew how good it could be to stand in your presence totally free.
[time=215] Now I'm forgiven, now I have a reason for a living, living. Jesus keeps giving and giving, a given, giving till my heart overflows.
[time=240] Now I can see you as a person who's real, given when I slip and fall, because he's a God who forgives and forgets.
[time=258] Now I want to give him my own. Now I'm forgiven, now I have a reason for a living, living. Jesus keeps giving and giving, a given, giving till my heart overflows.
[time=287] I know this love, he's placed in my heart, oh is the love that will never depart.
[time=303] Sing from me here to the end of my role. Now you've given me a brand new hope. Unforgiven, forgiveness.
[time=321] Unforgiven, unforgiven.
[time=345] Now I have a reason for a living, living. Jesus keeps giving and giving, a given, giving till my heart overflows.
[time=393] Now I'm forgiven.
[time=403] It's wonderful to meet in here in this worship center and to sing collectively, and yet also be reminded that Jesus Christ does forgive our sins.
[time=412] And many of us come today with sin in our lives, things that we've done that have disobeyed Jesus, and not all of us have done the same thing and need the same forgiveness.
[time=422] We do need to come to God and we can do that in any part of our service because that's what this worship service is all about, of getting that right relationship with the Lord through the singing and through the message through our prayer time that will be refueled and encouraged to go out and to serve Him next week.
[time=440] We believe that Jesus Christ saves, the song says, Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Him number 306. We'll sing the first, third and fourth stanzas together.
[time=465] Learn to find Jesus saves, the word of God. Jesus saves, the word of God. Jesus saves, the word of God.
[time=482] I must feed the cross to it, walk your ears on what's aware. Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
[time=496] Sing the word of God. Jesus saves, Jesus saves, the word of God. Jesus saves, Jesus saves, the word of God.
[time=516] I must feed the cross to it. Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
[time=529] Learn to find God. Jesus saves, Jesus saves, the word of God. Jesus saves, Jesus saves, the word of God.
[time=547] I must feed the cross to it. Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
[time=564] Oh, victory in Jesus, our song of victory is in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=570] Then roll comes now to continue with our music. Let's listen to her and her message in song right now.
[time=591] You can anchor for those who are hurting. We will harbor for those who are lost.
[time=606] Sometimes it's not always easy. Bearing power is cross.
[time=620] We've been ridiculed by those who don't know Him and not by those who don't believe.
[time=635] Still I love standing up for my Jesus because of all that He's done for me.
[time=649] That's why I am not ashamed of the gospel, the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=664] No, I am not afraid to be counted. I'm unwilling to give my life.
[time=678] I'm ready to be, all He wants me to be. Give up the love for the end.
[time=691] No, I am not ashamed of the gospel. No, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=707] For every moment His hand has held mercy for all the love He has shown all my life.
[time=734] This simple thanks doesn't say what I'm feeling. I get tears in my eyes.
[time=748] So as for me I'm going to keep on believing in the one who's been so faithful to me.
[time=762] I'm not out to please this whole world around me. I've got my mind on eternity.
[time=775] That's why I am not ashamed of the gospel, the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=790] No, I am not afraid to be counted. I'm willing to give my life.
[time=803] See I'm ready to be, all He wants me to be. Give up the love for the end.
[time=817] No, I am not ashamed of the gospel. No, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=856] I've got so much behind me to let this world line me to some His name.
[time=869] But to me He's my everything. I am not ashamed of the gospel. No, I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[time=885] No, I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[time=896] Jesus Christ
[time=923] We're glad that you joined us for the Bible Hour today. Thank you for tuning in and we are privileged to share with you our Morning Worship Service here.
[time=931] I have a special privilege of having with me today my friend Jim Pearson and Associate Pastor of Black Walk Baptist Church. Good morning Jim.
[time=938] Good morning Pete, it's always great to be here with you. We've had some very busy weeks lately. Things have slowed down just a little bit however.
[time=945] Yeah, they sure have slowed down but just a little bit as you said. Pete, right now we have going on here at Black Hawk our practical living seminars.
[time=952] The practical living seminars during the month of July meet every Wednesday night at seven o'clock. They're a great tradition here at Black Hawk.
[time=960] We try to give our people some practical Christian living guidance and so we have several different seminars going on.
[time=967] Disappointment with God. Christian financial concepts. How to live from a biblical healthy perspective. We have a lot going on in our practical living seminars but you just finished up with the panorama.
[time=978] Yes, we were delighted to again present the panorama. It's hard to believe it's been 17 years. We had a great friend Gary McSpadden with us and he certainly was an inspiration.
[time=988] It is a relief to have that gone but we are always thankful for the people even that watch in the Bible Hour that make a special point to come to events such as the Patriotic panorama.
[time=999] Last week we talked about a group that was going to Jamaica. 19 men and women met Saturday morning at 4.30 a.m. here in the parking lot of Black Hawk Baptist Church headed for Jamaica.
[time=1010] A great time two weeks of ministering down there helping the churches that we support. Jim you'll be joining them in just a couple days. Tell us a little bit about what's going to take place.
[time=1020] Pete we're leaving early Wednesday morning for Jamaica. We'll be joining the group. We'll be going to three different churches and three different cities in Jamaica ministering there and also working with the people in the communities. We're going to be going door to door witnessing for Christ.
[time=1034] I'm looking forward to a great time in the Lord. Well, it's very exciting for our people to go down there and see firsthand what we support financially.
[time=1042] I think it really encourages our people when they come back and they hear the good reports of things going on and lives being changed as far away as Jamaica.
[time=1051] Oh, that's so true, Pete. First of all, we had Jamaica 88 and a group from our church went down. This is Jamaica 1990 but our church has really developed a heart for the Jamaican people.
[time=1061] Well, that's really great. We're going to have a guest with us. It's a former member of our staff. His name is Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1068] Dr. Ken Nichols now resides in San Diego, California and is in charge of the alive counseling ministry.
[time=1075] He's going to be talking about the new age movement next week in our morning worship service and on the Bible hour.
[time=1082] I hope that you'll tune in for that very important topic. And then the following week he'll be talking about fear.
[time=1089] It's a very much a part of our life today. Fear of other people. Fear of the city and its environment and drugs and so many things that are commonplace now in this world.
[time=1103] And he can help you with just the fears that you have inside you of going to work, of working out and communicating with your children.
[time=1111] That will be an excellent time. Ken Nichols is a very outstanding speaker and I hope that you will join with us in the next two weeks of the Bible hour to hear Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1121] And then last week we introduced to you a cassette tape about the book of James. Jim James is a very important practical Christian living type book.
[time=1133] It has a lot of topics. I could think of the fact that he talks about temptation and all the problems that come along with the temptations of sin.
[time=1144] And yet those fears and those temptations can be overcome in triumph, he says in the book of James.
[time=1149] Oh yeah Pete. He also talks so very, very much about controlling our tongue and the dangers of not controlling our tongue and how important that is for successful Christian living.
[time=1158] I've heard that that's the world's smallest yet largest troublemaker, the tongue. And certainly we can all use a little control when it comes to being careful about what we say with one another.
[time=1169] There's also another topic in there about the relationship of rich people and poor people and how they are equal in the sight of God.
[time=1176] And I think that's a very important topic too.
[time=1178] James has to be one of the most practical books in the New Testament, Pete. And we have the writer of the study from Dr. Warren Wiersby on this tape, "Dina Moments in James."
[time=1189] We'd like to offer to you today, please write to us at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1201] Just ask for the cassette on the book of James. Again, the address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1213] We go back to our live portion of the broadcast now and we look forward to the message from our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=1221] The highest call is on my life, living for Jesus, no matter what Christ.
[time=1247] There's a crowd of life for those who give their all, living for Jesus, except in the highest call.
[time=1271] The coming of God's Kingdom has surged it as the dawn, but stands upon this dark and dying man.
[time=1291] Lord, God, I hear your calling me, my faith are you by all.
[time=1302] And in your strength I vow to make life stand, the highest call is on my life, living for Jesus, no matter what Christ.
[time=1331] There's a crowd of life for those who give their all, living for Jesus, except in the highest call.
[time=1383] Father, thank you so much this morning for the music that we have heard.
[time=1400] Thank you so much for the ministry that it has as we walk the Christian life.
[time=1405] Thank you for the truths that we can glean from it.
[time=1408] I thank you for a song this morning that would say yesterday you died for us, died for each of us that we might have everlasting life.
[time=1416] And yet today you live for us, you're here for us, we can gain strength for living, we have power for life because you live today.
[time=1426] Father, we thank you for that resurrection power.
[time=1429] And Father, I also pray that someday you will come for us, you will come for us again as you have your great second coming.
[time=1437] Father, I praise you for that truth.
[time=1440] It just aughs me as I face you this morning in prayer, knowing that you are indeed the sovereign Lord of our universe.
[time=1448] But Father, as we come to you in prayer this morning, we also come confidently and yet humbly with so many prayer requests for you.
[time=1456] Father, we would pray so fervently for the McCord family in the loss of a young mother, a young wife.
[time=1463] Father, we would pray for Craig and for the young girls that are left behind, that you would give them strength.
[time=1469] Father, there's little lives right now that are asking why.
[time=1473] But Father, I just pray that you would reach down, that you would comfort them, wrap your arms around them, comfort girls that have lost a mother.
[time=1481] Comfort a man that has lost a life's partner at such a tragic age of just 30 years old.
[time=1487] Father, thank you so much for the way that you can minister, but we just ask that you would be with them in the weeks, days, and months ahead, and even years.
[time=1497] And Father, we would continue to pray for Marv Eastland.
[time=1500] We thank you for the surgery that he had, but we pray as he is back again in the Mayo Clinic.
[time=1505] We would pray that you would give wisdom to doctors and pray that you would give them the insight to deal with the problems that Marv is having.
[time=1512] They would be back from the Mayo Clinic, back with us at Blackhawk, so soon again.
[time=1517] Father, I pray and thank you for those that are here this morning who just in recent days and weeks were in beds of affliction, either at home or in the hospitals throughout Fort Wayne.
[time=1526] Father, thank you for the way that you've healed us.
[time=1528] Thank you for the way that you've healed them, that you've brought them back to us.
[time=1532] Most of all, Father, thank you for your word this morning, and I ask that you would bless me as we proclaim your word to the congregation today.
[time=1540] Prepare our hearts, prepare our ears to hear that we might apply your truths to our lives.
[time=1545] In Christ's name, amen.
[time=1550] Earlier this week, my wife came up to me and asked me what I was going to preach on, and at that time I wasn't sure.
[time=1557] She informed me that I had preached five out of the last six messages on Sunday mornings that I had been here from the Book of Philippians.
[time=1564] And I liked the Book of Philippians, but she said, of course I thought about that, and I thought, well, the only reason it wasn't more was at Christmastime.
[time=1572] I preached out of one of the gospels as I preached the Christmas story.
[time=1576] But she suggested I try something from the Old Testament, and that got me thinking.
[time=1580] I started asking myself why it is, don't preachers preach more out of the Old Testament than what they do.
[time=1585] I had a Hebrew professor at seminary who said that it was his theory that the reason that ministers didn't preach more out of the Old Testament was that they didn't learn anything.
[time=1593] They didn't learn Hebrew well enough in seminary to feel comfortable with the Old Testament.
[time=1598] He then felt that he was going to be extremely difficult and hard to force us to pick up Hebrew that we might preach more from the Old Testament.
[time=1606] I guess my lack of preaching in the Old Testament lets you know how well I did in Hebrew.
[time=1610] Well, I'm not really sure what the reasons are, but I was thinking this week about a time that might trace it back.
[time=1616] It was about two years after I had become a Christian, and I had given a testimony in a couple of churches, and one in Southern Ohio invited me back to preach.
[time=1625] I had never preached before. I really didn't know what I was doing, and all I know is that I thumbed through the Old Testament,
[time=1631] and I finally found some verses in Obadiah that I thought that I would preach.
[time=1636] Well, I went down to that church, and the time I got ready to preach and got up to the pulpit and began, and as I asked them to turn to the book of Obadiah, I couldn't find it.
[time=1647] And I began to scan through the Old Testament quickly, looking for the book of Obadiah.
[time=1652] And the more I looked, the more frantic I got, because I realized that although it was only seconds, they would soon realize that I didn't know where the book of Obadiah was.
[time=1660] Well, I tried that little song you learn in Sunday school, you know, singing my way through. I couldn't figure it out.
[time=1666] So finally, I stopped, and I said this. I said, "Perhaps there are some who are with us today that are new believers."
[time=1673] And it's possible that you cannot find the book of Obadiah. Don't feel guilty about that.
[time=1678] I'd just like you to turn with me to the table of contents, and let's look together at where the book of Obadiah is.
[time=1684] If you'll look in my Bible, it's found on page 1,212. You can look and see where it's found in your Bible, and we'll all turn to it together.
[time=1694] That got me out of that moment. But with that in mind, if you have a Bible with you this morning, turn with me to the book of Habakkuk in the Old Testament.
[time=1705] I didn't trust myself. I have a paperclip where Habakkuk is in my NIV Bible. But I would like to preach this morning for a while.
[time=1713] From the book of Habakkuk, we'll also be moving into some New Testament scripture, but I want to deal this morning on the subject of dealing with those nagging doubts.
[time=1722] Let's ask the Lord again to bless our time. Father, thank you so much for your word. Thank you that I might open your word today.
[time=1730] Thank you that we can all read it, study it, meditate upon it, learn from it, and impart it into our lives.
[time=1736] Father, thank you for the way that you bless and lead. Bless us now in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1743] I had the privilege this year of managing a little league baseball team.
[time=1749] Had a great deal of enjoyment out of working with those young lives. We lost a lot. We won some.
[time=1755] But we had a good time and we all learned a little bit. Hopefully we all gained in baseball ability and learned a little bit about character facing the adversities of life and losing and all of those things that athletics can help us with.
[time=1769] But as I was going through the tournament in Little League up until about a week ago when our team was eliminated, I began to think back to my own Little League times.
[time=1779] And I remembered one year as a ten year old where we had a tremendous Little League team that I played on.
[time=1786] We kind of sailed through the season with only one or two losses. We went into that postseason tournament and we were just full of confidence and faith in ourselves.
[time=1795] We were downright cocky is what we were. We believed that we had all that it took to win. We were going to win the City Championship.
[time=1802] And as we began to go through the tournament and win a few games, we got even worse. Confidence began to rise up in us and faith in ourselves.
[time=1810] We not only believed in ourselves as individuals, but we believed that our team was invincible.
[time=1816] Then as you go along in the tournament, you know, you start to play teams from other parts of the city that you're not familiar with.
[time=1823] And as we watched this one team warm up one day, we realized that they had a pitcher and we had never seen anybody throw a baseball as fast as him.
[time=1831] To a ten year old, he looked like Nolan Ryan coming at you with a 90 mile an hour fastball. Well, we were confident.
[time=1839] We had faith in ourselves. But I believe that a few nagging doubts began to creep in as we watched him fire the ball toward home plate.
[time=1848] I remember the first time I went up to bat against him. I wasn't going to let him beat me. I had faith in myself, faith in my own abilities.
[time=1855] And as I went up there three pitches later, I sat down. Never took the bat off my shoulder. Well, a few winnings later, I got my second time up.
[time=1864] And I have to let you know that although I still had confidence in my ability to hit this pitcher, a few nagging doubts were beginning to creep in.
[time=1873] Well, this time I was able to get a little piece of the ball and trickled it back to the pitcher and he threw me out at first, but at least I hadn't struck out.
[time=1880] At least I'd hit the ball. Maybe next time it would be better. Well, later in the game we were losing and I'd like to see I came up and won the game, but I didn't.
[time=1889] But as I came up for my last time, I remember strongly two forces at work inside me. One was a faith that I wasn't going to let this guy beat me and that I had the ability to hit him.
[time=1901] But also at work were those growing now nagging doubts and a beginning to doubt my faith and my ability in myself to hit this pitcher.
[time=1911] Well, I went up and I remember I swung mightily on the first two pitches and got nothing but air. Two strikes. I was in trouble.
[time=1918] Well, I decided to dig in and I remember well on that last pitch as the ball left his hands. I mustered up all the faith and courage and confidence into myself that I could close my eyes and swung the bat as hard as I could.
[time=1933] I heard the crack of the bat on the ball and I looked up and there was the ball heading out toward right field and it was going to be a good hit and I began to run.
[time=1941] I think I got all the way to third base before the ball got back into the infield, but I was ecstatic. I had gotten a triple off this guy.
[time=1950] Well, I believe that that story illustrates well what I want to talk about this morning because at work inside that 10 year old baseball player were two things.
[time=1961] First of all, faith. Faith at work in his life that he could perform as a baseball player, but at the same time nagging doubts that were creeping in that perhaps this guy was a little better than I was and I would have a little trouble.
[time=1978] I believe that illustrates in many cases the way it is for us in our spiritual lives because I believe that it's often true in our spiritual lives that faith and doubt can go hand in hand in the life of the believer.
[time=1993] I believe that in the life of the believer, although we have our faith in Jesus Christ, we've trusted in him, there are times for many of us when nagging doubts come in and begin to cloud us a little bit in our mind.
[time=2008] Perhaps it's because of the loss of a job and we say to ourselves, well, I have faith in God and the Bible says that he is good, but perhaps we say to ourselves, but God, if you're good, why did you have to let me lose my job?
[time=2025] How am I going to feed my family?
[time=2029] Perhaps it comes when we lose a loved one and we can't understand it and we say to ourselves, God, I know that you love me, but if you loved me, how could you let this tragedy happen in my life?
[time=2043] Perhaps it might be a missionary and his wife who comes home from 40 years on the mission field and not too long after they come back from their retirement.
[time=2051] The husband dies and a wife is left behind and perhaps she says, God, I served you faithfully for 30 years and I know that my faith is strong, but God, your Bible promises that you'll be faithful, that you'll reward us for our service.
[time=2068] Why did you let that happen?
[time=2072] I believe that many times as these doubts come in, we begin to feel guilty because we are taught at a very young age that faith is the way it should be and that doubt is always wrong, and many times we begin to feel guilty.
[time=2087] Perhaps we keep it to ourselves and keep the doubt internalized and don't face up to it because we're afraid of what it means in our life.
[time=2097] Well, I want to talk this morning about dealing with those nagging doubts, and if you are dealing with those nagging doubts this morning, my premise is that we should not feel guilty about that.
[time=2108] What I want to talk about this morning is dealing with those doubts, admitting them, bringing them out into the open, and when we have those times in our lives when things don't seem to add up and we come to God with doubt in our minds, I believe that we need to deal with that.
[time=2125] For I believe that doubt, if dealt with properly, can be a time of spiritual growth in the life of a believer.
[time=2133] Doubt, if dealt with properly, can be a time of great spiritual maturing as we walk through the steps of dealing with that doubt.
[time=2142] Oh, make no mistake, in no way do I say that doubt is good, and in no way am I saying that we should ever allow it to take hold of our lives and allow it to overcrowd our faith.
[time=2153] Oh, no, but I do believe that we need to deal with it, and I do believe that it's a part of this life that we walk as believers in Jesus Christ.
[time=2163] In the book of Habakkuk, I want to talk about our first point this morning, but before I do that, let me tell you that this morning I'd like to make three suggestions for handling those nagging doubts that come into our lives.
[time=2176] I'd like to give you three suggestions that I believe will be helpful in dealing with those nagging doubts that many times come our way as we walk this life as a believer.
[time=2187] In the book of Habakkuk, we have the first point this morning that I'd like to make, and that is this, realize that even great people of faith can have doubts.
[time=2197] Realize that even great leaders of the faith can have times in their life when nagging doubts creep in, and they have to face them.
[time=2207] In the Old Testament in the book of Habakkuk, we have this great prophet. He's known as one of the minor prophets. That doesn't mean that he is something less than what we call one of the major prophets. He was a great servant of God.
[time=2219] God used Habakkuk mightily to prophesy his word, to send his word out to a generation in which Habakkuk lived. He was a great servant of God, but as we turn to the book of Habakkuk, we see that doubt has crept in to Habakkuk's life.
[time=2236] He is looking around, and he sees evil triumphing over good. He sees treachery winning out over faithfulness, and he begins to question God, and he comes to God with a complaint.
[time=2248] I believe that nagging doubt was creeping in to Habakkuk's mind. He says this, "How long, O Lord, must I call for help, but you do not listen, or cry out to you, violence, but you do not save.
[time=2261] Why do you make me look at injustice? Why do you tolerate wrong? Destruction and violence are before me. There is strife and conflict abounding. Therefore, the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails.
[time=2274] The wicked hem in the righteous so that justice is perverted." In the life of Habakkuk, as he looked around at what was going on around him, doubt had crept into his life, and he brought it to God's attention.
[time=2289] In the New Testament, of course, we have that story of John the Baptist. John the Baptist, that great forerunner of Christ, who had proclaimed that Messiah was coming.
[time=2298] But then you'll remember a time when John the Baptist was in prison. In the seventh chapter of the book of Luke, he's discouraged, he's down, he's wondering.
[time=2308] And I believe that nagging doubt had begun to creep in, and he sent his men to ask Jesus, "Are you really the one who was to come, or should we be looking for someone else?"
[time=2321] Even great men of faith can have doubts. Jim Conway is one of my favorite authors. Jim Conway and his wife wrote one of the classic books in Christian counseling called Men in Midlife Crisis.
[time=2334] It's a great book. Jim Conway has been a pastor for over 30 years. He was a professor at Talbot's Seminary. He has spent his entire life as a minister, ministering to those in need, ministering, consoling, helping those going through these times of doubt and struggle.
[time=2353] But Jim Conway writes in his book what God gives when life takes, that when he had to face a malignancy in the life of his daughter, that it kind of knocked the props out from under his faith.
[time=2365] He said that as he prayed, he prayed with all confidence that God would heal his daughter. But as the time came and the surgery came and he realized that God was not answering his prayers. For a time, he became bitter. His daughter's leg had to be amputated. And he had a hard time as he struggled with that.
[time=2383] He said that he went to the elders of his church and he began bombarding them with questions. He said, "Where was God when Becky was having her leg cut off?" He asked a close friend, "How can I go back into the pulpit and teach that the Bible is true?" How can I tell others that prayer works?
[time=2401] Well, fortunately, Jim Conway came to grips with those doubts. He admitted them. He went to the Word and he worked his way through them. And of course, he is a strong and vibrant minister and author today.
[time=2412] But even great men of faith can have doubts. If you're dealing with doubt in your life this morning, don't feel guilty about it. Admit it, face up to it. Prepare to deal with it.
[time=2425] For that's the first step in dealing with doubt. Realizing that great people of faith doubt and that admitting the doubt yourself and facing up to the doubt that's in your life.
[time=2437] Secondly, this morning, I want to say that after we have realized that even great people of faith have doubts, after we have dealt with the doubts that are at work in our lives, secondly, I believe that we should seek to find the source of our doubts.
[time=2452] As I stated before, many experience times of doubt in their lives. Doubts concerning questions of the sovereignty of God in certain situations, we become troubled over some of the events of life and circumstances cause those doubts to come in.
[time=2472] Well, I believe that many times those thoughts can creep in and when they do, they result in anger toward God, anger toward others. Sometimes they result in guilt feelings inside of us as we keep them to ourselves.
[time=2487] But I believe that there are definite sources of doubt in our lives and I believe that if we try to seek the source when those doubts come, we can help ourselves.
[time=2496] The first thing that I would like to tell you today is that weak foundations are a source of doubt. Weak foundations are a source of doubt. Many times in evangelical churches across America and around the world, we proclaim the gospel and we must do that.
[time=2513] We invite people to come forward and to pray a prayer. We invite them to come and be baptized and to trust Christ as their Savior and as their Lord.
[time=2522] And all we need to do that and to continue to invite and to proclaim the word that we can bring as many into the kingdom.
[time=2529] But we must be very careful that we don't stop there. For I believe that a weak foundation can be a source of doubt in the life of a new believer.
[time=2538] We need to make sure that as new believers come into the kingdom, that we ground them in the word, that we disciple them.
[time=2545] That's why our ABF classes are so important and our new believers class is so important. That's why it's so important that each of us reach out to new believers, to disciple them, to ground them, to help to build them up in the Christian faith.
[time=2559] I believe that when people have weak foundations, when that root is weak, as we talk about in the parable of the sower, that when the storms of life come, nagging doubt can creep in.
[time=2571] Yes, the first one is weak foundations. We must be very, very careful to ground new believers in the word. In Acts chapter 11, Barnabas goes to Antioch and he sees a great work in the church at Antioch.
[time=2585] Many are being saved. The Holy Spirit is being poured out. Things are going great. But what did Barnabas do? He went to get Paul.
[time=2593] And he and Paul came and they stayed for an entire year and they worked with those people in Antioch and they grounded them in the faith and taught them daily, getting them prepared for the storms of life that would come their way.
[time=2607] One source of doubt, weak foundations. Are you grounded in the word today? Oh, I'd pray that we all are. A second cause, I believe, is unrealistic expectations.
[time=2619] We might subtitle that in proper theology. Unrealistic expectations.
[time=2625] I believe that there are times when nagging doubts come into our life and frustrations come and we get angry with God because we expect God to do things that we have no right to expect him to do.
[time=2636] I believe that at times it can be even our parents who are looking out for us, who can be a source of bad theology. Sometimes it's a friend who comes and who tries to encourage and he says things to us about what God will do.
[time=2652] Perhaps it's some presuppositions that we come to the Christian faith with that cause us to have problems.
[time=2659] But when we have an improper theology, when we expect more from God than what he has promised to do, then when he doesn't come through for us, we can have times of doubt and nagging, nagging doubt.
[time=2674] Let me just give you a couple of examples of what I'm talking about. It's very common among some new believers especially, but among some mature believers to believe that as long as they are faithful and are serving God well, that nothing bad will ever happen to them.
[time=2688] And the converse they believe is that when they are bad, when they're not walking with Jesus Christ, that God somehow will punish them.
[time=2696] Oh, that sounds good, but that's not what the Bible teaches. Oh, yes, God does chasten those who love him and those who he loves.
[time=2704] But I believe that to try to say that as long as we do good, God will bless us in our lives. Oh, that's bad theology that sets us up for disappointment and for nagging doubt.
[time=2715] Some have come with an idea that when we believe in Jesus Christ, God somehow puts a protective bubble over us.
[time=2723] And as we go through life, all of the trials and tribulations that come will not touch us because we are believers.
[time=2730] Well, that's not what the Bible teaches. The Bible teaches. In Philippians chapter 3, Paul said, "I have suffered the loss of all things, and yet Paul was faithful.
[time=2742] Paul was solid in his faith and his belief and in his service to Christ." Unrealistic expectations.
[time=2749] And then thirdly, wearying situations. Let me explain that. I'm not speaking here about the major traumas of life that come our way.
[time=2761] I'm not speaking about the death of a child or the death of a spouse. I'm not speaking here about some of those tragedies that come into our life, like the loss of a career at an age when it will be hard to replace that job.
[time=2774] Now, when I talk about wearying situations, I'm talking about day-to-day stresses of life. Day-to-day stresses of Christian living in suburbia, where most of us are today.
[time=2786] You know, many times as believers, men and women are at work in the corporate world. And there's tremendous demands that are put upon your lives.
[time=2794] You're demanded 40 hours and sometimes 45 and 50 and 55 hours. And as you go through those stresses of life in the marketplace, it's easy to get weary.
[time=2806] It's easy to get down. And then you come home and there's of course the problems of the home to deal with.
[time=2812] There are of course all of the obligations of your children and all of the activities that they're involved in. And sometimes you can just feel like the reserves just aren't there to kick in.
[time=2824] Wearing situations, I believe, are times when doubt can creep in for we get discouraged. We get frustrated. We feel like giving up and we say, "I've just got to get off of this merry-go-round." And doubt can creep in.
[time=2839] I think one of the toughest jobs on earth is that of a homemaker. That of having to go through the rigors of raising a family of children.
[time=2848] And if you're at home raising children today as a homemaker, God bless you for all that you do. But I know what a stressful life that can be.
[time=2856] Life for us in America today, as you cart those children back from little league to soccer practice, to wildcat, to swimming lessons, to dancing lessons, to singing lessons, to piano lessons.
[time=2868] And then come home and try to do all of the responsibilities that are there. The cooking and the cleaning and all of those things.
[time=2875] All this tremendous stress. I believe that can be a wearying situation. It can get us down in our faith.
[time=2882] One of America's funniest and best writers is Irma Bombak. Irma Bombak has endeared herself to us as Americans so well by her great insights into the family.
[time=2893] And she just itches us right where we are in life. Irma Bombak wrote a book not too long ago called "Motherhood, the second oldest profession."
[time=2903] But in that book she has a story here about Mother's Day. Mother's Day. And she said that Mother's Day is that one day when mothers get a chance to relax tongue in cheek.
[time=2915] That's one of those days when mothers get a chance to just kind of kick back, chill out, and relax and let their children serve them.
[time=2924] She writes this about Mother's Day. On this day, all over the country, mothers are pushed back into their pillows, their bird of paradise, which blooms every year for 15 minutes, is snipped and put in a glass.
[time=2936] And a strange assortment of food comes out of a kitchen destined to take the sight out of a good eye.
[time=2942] A mixer whirs out of control and then stops abruptly as a voice cries. I'm telling a dog barks and another voice says, "Get his paws out of there. Mom has to eat that."
[time=2957] Minutes pass and finally another voice says, "Dad, where's the chili sauce?"
[time=2964] Lastly, one of the children has heard to say to the other, "Don't you dare bleed on mom's breakfast."
[time=2972] The result is a blur of banging doors, running water, rapid footsteps, and finally you started the fire, you put it out.
[time=2980] The breakfast is fairly standard. A water tumbler of juice, five pieces of black bacon that snap in half when you breathe on them,
[time=2988] a mound of eggs that would feed a marine division, and four pieces of cold toast.
[time=2993] They line up on the bed to watch you eat, and from time to time, they ask you why you're not drinking your Kool-Aid,
[time=3000] or touching the cantaloupe with the black olives on them that spell "mom."
[time=3007] Later that night, after you have decided it's easier to move to a new house than to clean the kitchen,
[time=3013] you return to your bed and you encounter beneath the blanket either a black jelly bean, a planter's wort, or a black olive that put the "o" in mom.
[time=3024] And if you're wise, you'll reflect on this day.
[time=3028] For the first time your children gave instead of received, they offered up to you the sincerest form of flattery, trying to emulate what you would do for them.
[time=3038] They gave you one of the greatest give people can give themselves.
[time=3043] Oh, it's just too bad that Mother's Day can't come 52 times a year instead of once.
[time=3049] But as we go through those wearying, stressful days of our lives, no matter what be our circumstances or our situation or our particular job,
[time=3058] whether it be in the home or in the marketplace, I believe that wearying situations take their toll.
[time=3064] And when we get down and stressed out, they can cause us to have nagging doubts as we get discouraged and wonder.
[time=3072] Oh, if you're going through that today, there's no magic formula for dealing with that.
[time=3077] Our lives are all one of three things. They're all busy or they're busy or they're busy.
[time=3084] But I believe that it's necessary for all of us to slow down, to take a time and step back,
[time=3091] to make sure that we take that quiet time with God, that we renew our spiritual energies and juices and prepare for those tough days.
[time=3100] Yes, a second thing is seek to find the source of our doubts.
[time=3105] There, I believe, are three of them. There are, of course, more.
[time=3109] Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, seek diligently to overcome the doubt.
[time=3115] It's very critical that as we go through these steps of seeing the doubt, admitting the doubt and dealing with the doubt,
[time=3123] that we don't allow that doubt to overcome our faith.
[time=3127] It's important that we seek the help and that we deal with the doubt and work our way through it,
[time=3133] so that we can get back to that victorious Christian living that God has called us to.
[time=3139] I believe that in Mark chapter 9, we have an example of someone who was trying to work his way through a doubt.
[time=3146] Remember in Mark chapter 9, a man brings his son to Jesus. His son is demon-possessed,
[time=3152] and he's asking Jesus about whether he can heal his son or not.
[time=3156] And Jesus said, "If you have faith, I can heal this man." And the man reached out to Jesus, and he said, "I believe, please help my unbelief."
[time=3169] I believe that there were two forces at work in that man's life.
[time=3174] On one hand, faith that Jesus Christ was who he said he was.
[time=3178] Yet at the same time, some nagging doubts that were still being carried along as baggage in this man's life.
[time=3184] But notice that he didn't keep them to himself. He reached out to Jesus, and he said, "Please help me."
[time=3190] "Help me with my unbelief." "Oh, I believe, but help me." I want to suggest four things to you this morning that I believe will help you work through your doubts and help you to overcome them.
[time=3205] First of all, find a friend who walks with you.
[time=3209] Find a friend that you can reach out to.
[time=3212] This man reached out to Jesus for help.
[time=3215] Find someone that you can reach out to.
[time=3218] Find a friend, someone that you can trust in, someone who will keep your confidence, someone who will sit up with you into those long hours of the night and discuss the trials and tribulations that you're going through.
[time=3231] Someone who will share his innermost feelings with you, someone who will be there for you.
[time=3237] Find a friend to walk with and share your doubts and your concerns with him.
[time=3243] Bring them out to him, discuss them, listen to his input, listen to his encouragement and his advice.
[time=3251] Find a friend who walks with you.
[time=3253] Secondly, find the word which speaks to you.
[time=3258] Find the word that speaks to you.
[time=3261] And by that I mean the word of God.
[time=3264] I believe that one of the steps toward working through those nagging doubts is to reach for God's word, to search his word,
[time=3272] and look and relate to those who went through those same trials and tribulations and nagging doubts that you're going through.
[time=3280] And watch the victory that they had and read about it in God's word.
[time=3286] In the book of Habakkuk, he started out with the complaints and as he went on he mentioned three more complaints.
[time=3292] But God dealt with him and we see Habakkuk at the end of his book saying this.
[time=3299] The sovereign Lord is my strength.
[time=3302] He makes my feet like the feet of a deer.
[time=3305] He enables me to go on the heights.
[time=3307] Habakkuk as we used to say had gotten back the victory.
[time=3312] He had overcome his doubts.
[time=3314] He had reached out to his Lord.
[time=3317] We can reach out to God through his word.
[time=3320] By studying those who suffered, by studying those who also doubted the great men of faith and seeing how they worked their way through.
[time=3328] Those times.
[time=3330] And then thirdly, find a mentor who walks with you.
[time=3335] And by that I mean find an example.
[time=3338] Someone that you can look up to.
[time=3340] Someone who you can put your faith in.
[time=3342] Someone who has walked in those same steps that you have and who can help you and be a role model to you.
[time=3350] Most of you know that we have two boys, one four and one nine.
[time=3360] He wants to do everything that his older brother does.
[time=3364] He doesn't want to do anything that his older brother doesn't do.
[time=3368] A couple of weeks ago I shared with you my four year old's ideas of what a great vacation was.
[time=3374] That he could stay up as late as he wanted.
[time=3376] That was vacation to him.
[time=3378] On that same vacation we found out that for our nine year old, vacation to him is to not have to do anything that he normally does.
[time=3387] One day we were getting ready to go out and Linda said to him, "Andrew, have you changed your clothes?"
[time=3393] And he said, "Yep, I'm ready to go." He says, "You have your shoes on." He said, "Yep, I'm ready to go." She said, "If you washed your face," he said, "Yep, I'm ready to go." She said, "Drew, have you brushed your teeth?" And he just kind of stared at her.
[time=3409] And she said, "Andrew, I asked you, have you brushed your teeth?" And he looked at her rather quizzically and he said, "Brush my teeth, brush my teeth.
[time=3418] I haven't brushed my teeth since we went on vacation." His four year old brother had been watching him.
[time=3424] He hadn't brushed his teeth either since we went on vacation.
[time=3427] Sometimes he's a good role model.
[time=3429] Sometimes he's a bad one.
[time=3431] I guess that's the case with all of us.
[time=3433] But the fact of the matter is, in working through our doubts, we need to find a role model, a mentor, someone that we can look up to, somebody that we can follow.
[time=3444] And then lastly this morning, find the God who waits for you.
[time=3449] If you're working your way through those nagging doubts, God is there waiting for you today.
[time=3461] [MUSIC]
[time=3477] We've been sharing with you the exciting musical ministry of celebration and soloist Lynn Roll.
[time=3483] The message today was from our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=3487] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3496] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3503] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3507] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3512] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3517] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3521] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3530] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the cassette tape by Warren Wiersby, please write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
