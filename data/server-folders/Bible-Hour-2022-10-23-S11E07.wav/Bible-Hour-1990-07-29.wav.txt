[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] The New Age movement is rapidly becoming one of the most interesting topics in Christian
[time=74] circles today.
[time=75] Every Christian bookstore is filled with books and tapes and literature that introduces us to the New Age strategy.
[time=81] I believe that Satan is behind much of the New Age movement, and I've often said that the closer to truth a lie becomes, the higher the probability of deception.
[time=92] And so in our service this morning, I want to alert the believer in how to understand and know the truth, and thereby be free of deception.
[time=102] (music playing)
[time=110] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=116] Thank you for joining us.
[time=118] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=121] Dr. Nichols is the Director of the Alive Counseling Ministry.
[time=125] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=130] Special music today includes a duet from Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowell, and an organ solo
[time=137] from Scott Schindler.
[time=140] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a medley entitled "The Lord Thy God."
[time=149] The Lord Thy God, in the midst of he is mighty, is mighty, he will save, he will rejoice,
[time=174] he will rejoice, he will rejoice, he will rejoice, he will join, he will sing.
[time=181] The Lord Thy God, in the midst of he is mighty, he is mighty, he is mighty, he will save,
[time=234] he is mighty, he is mighty, he is mighty, he is mighty, he is mighty, he is mighty,
[time=391] I am thankful for the living river of life that the Lord Jesus Christ gives us through
[time=412] the Holy Spirit, the living life that He gives because of the life that He is given in us.
[time=419] Let us continue praising the Lord together as we confirm our belief in Jesus Christ by
[time=449] the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit,
[time=568] Thank you for your good singing, the Bible indeed talks about singing in a number of passages and Psalms, he says, "Sing to the Lord and be not silent." Kevin Rowe and Denise
[time=578] Mitchell will be singing in a moment and their text comes from Psalm 30, listen to these words as I read them to you, "Sing to the Lord, you saints of His praises holy name,
[time=588] for His anger lasts only a moment, but His favor lasts a lifetime.
[time=594] Weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.
[time=599] You turned my wailing into dancing, you removed my sackcloth and hold me with joy, that my
[time=605] heart may sing to you and not be silent.
[time=609] O Lord, my God, I will give you thanks forever."
[time=637] Sing to the Lord, He is worthy of praise, raise up your voices in song, sing to the
[time=649] Lord for the rest of your day, tune in your praises law, sing, sing to the Lord, he's
[time=662] done marvelous things, creation renounces his name, sing to the Lord, he's the Savior and
[time=674] sing to the Lord, he's the Savior, he's the Lord, he's the Lord, he's the Lord, he's
[time=702] the Lord, he's the Lord, he's the Lord, he's the Lord, he's the Lord, he's the Lord,
[time=723] sing to the Lord, he's worthy of praise, raise up your voices in song, sing to the
[time=735] Lord for the rest of your day, tune in your praises law, sing, sing to the Lord, he's
[time=751] the Lord, he's the Lord.
[time=766] I want to say a very special thank you today for those of you that watch the Bible hour faithfully each week.
[time=772] And I like to make a request of you.
[time=774] If you have been watching for a number of weeks now, would you take a moment this week and tell some of your neighbors and friends and even relatives about the Bible hour and ask them to tune in?
[time=784] We'd really appreciate that.
[time=786] Our speaker for the next two weeks is Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=789] Dr. Nichols is no stranger to Blackhawk Baptist Church in the Bible hour because he was a member of our staff for a number of years.
[time=796] Good morning Ken.
[time=798] It's nice to have you back in Fort Wayne today.
[time=801] Ken is now out in San Diego, California and is involved with the live counseling center
[time=807] out there as you were here.
[time=809] How long has it been Ken since you were a member of our staff here at Blackhawk?
[time=814] I left Blackhawk about seven years ago Pete and since then I have been involved at Christian Heritage College in San Diego, California.
[time=821] As you know with Pastor Jeremiah, the former pastor here at Blackhawk and he is the president of the college there and the pastor, senior pastor of the church.
[time=830] And so I continue to be in the classroom and teach and still am involved quite a bit in counseling and some seminars.
[time=836] So just much the same as I did when I was here.
[time=839] That's great.
[time=840] Your wife Marlene was involved in a lot of activities in the church.
[time=843] How is your family doing and update us a little bit on them?
[time=846] All right.
[time=847] My two older children of course are in college there at Christian Heritage.
[time=849] My daughter is going to be soon 20 years old.
[time=853] She's majoring in counseling and home economics and my son is majoring in business and he'll be a senior this coming year.
[time=859] And then our youngest daughter Cara will be in the fifth grade coming up soon.
[time=864] And Marlene is doing well.
[time=866] She is the secretary in the counseling department and provides help for us there and she's also involved in music as you know.
[time=873] She sings and plays the organ and we love it there.
[time=875] We enjoy the ministry and the church and being with Pastor Jeremiah.
[time=878] Well, I'm sure Pastor Jeremiah appreciates having you on his staff and the friendship that you've cultivated over the years.
[time=885] Ken, you're going to be with us for the next two weeks on the Bible Hour.
[time=888] We have kind of a unique title, Age Old Truth for the New Age Movement.
[time=892] Just give us a little synopsis of what you're going to be speaking on.
[time=895] Okay.
[time=896] In the first service this morning, I want to spend most of my time trying to at least introduce the people to the basic concepts of the New Age Movement.
[time=904] It is quite complex and in order to be involved in successful spiritual warfare, you must understand the dynamics and the strategy of the enemy.
[time=913] So today I want to introduce the people how I believe that the New Age Movement is in
[time=919] fact preparation for the appearance of the Antichrist.
[time=923] I think this is all part of Satan's strategy to gather followers for his final attack against
[time=929] God.
[time=930] And so believers need to be alert and aware of how it's happening and how to be equipped to deal with it.
[time=935] Well, these will be two important messages and if you're watching us today, I hope that you will make it a point to stay tuned for this morning's broadcast and then be with us next week for Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=946] You'll enjoy these very informative messages for the next two weeks.
[time=951] I'd like to take a moment and tell you about a concert that's coming up on Sunday night, July 29th.
[time=956] We'll be having with us the White Family.
[time=959] Clifford White and his family live right here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=963] They have five children and they all sing, all do solo work.
[time=968] They sing together as a family of very exciting time of music on Sunday evening, July 29th
[time=975] at 6 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=979] I hope that you'll set aside that evening, join with us for a delightful time of entertainment and music from the White Family from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=989] And then we've been offering to you a new cassette entitled "Dina Moments in James" by Dr. Warren Wiersby.
[time=997] These are 31 separate segments of devotions by Dr. Wiersby that you can use on a daily
[time=1003] basis.
[time=1004] Excellent, excellent studies in the book of James.
[time=1007] I hope that you'll write for this cassette today.
[time=1010] And you can receive "Dina Moments in James" by Dr. Warren Wiersby by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1024] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1033] I hope that you'll write today and tell us that you're watching the Bible Hour and ask for that gift offer.
[time=1039] We're going back to the live portion of our program today and we look forward to the messages in the next two weeks from our special guest, Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1072] [MUSIC - 268 seconds]
[time=1344] Special thanks to Scott Schindler for his ministry on the organ.
[time=1348] I really do appreciate his faithfulness.
[time=1351] He's a great team player and has a great ministry and a great ability at the organ.
[time=1356] We are very, very fortunate at Black Hawk to have a man of his skill and his ability and dedication.
[time=1364] And we're grateful for you, Scott, for that.
[time=1368] Some of our men in particular, Jim Pearson and John Verspot have been very faithful in visiting people in the hospital.
[time=1375] One of the things that you could do for us is if you know of someone that's going in for an operation or has a need and will be in the hospital, if you can let our office know, we are very anxious to pray for them
[time=1387] and to be aware of the needs of our people.
[time=1390] A couple weeks ago, we mentioned to you that Marv Islin was going in for surgery and he had that surgery
[time=1396] and he was progressing well, has taken somewhat of a setback recently and has gone back into the hospital.
[time=1403] However, we are encouraged by the doctor's comments that it will take time, he has a blood infection
[time=1409] and it will take time for him to heal.
[time=1411] While he is a very ill man right now, the doctors are encouraged that he will indeed begin to heal.
[time=1417] That will be a long process.
[time=1419] So I hope that in this particular week, you will keep in mind Marvin and Phyllis Islin and their family
[time=1425] and pray that Marv will receive the exact antibiotics and medicine that he needs to strengthen his body
[time=1434] and that he will be encouraged throughout this week.
[time=1437] I'd like to take this moment right now and pray especially for that family. Will you bow with me, please?
[time=1442] Our father were humbled and we just thank you that we can sing that you are such a great God
[time=1450] and that you can just take time for individual families and individuals and intercede in their time of need.
[time=1458] And this is particularly true as we think of Dr. Marv Islin and the surgery that he has just recently gone through
[time=1464] and the seriousness of this surgery.
[time=1468] And we pray now as his body reacts from the surgery and begins to heal again
[time=1474] that you will give the doctor's wisdom in the medicine that they give him.
[time=1478] You will give them patience and him patience as well as the family to see that healing process take place in your good time.
[time=1486] We pray particularly for Phyllis as she stands by her spouse, her loved one,
[time=1492] give her an added amount of support and strength physically to endure during this time.
[time=1499] We pray for Shelly and the rest of the kids that you'll just watch over and care for them and strengthen them and give them confidence that you are indeed interceding in their father's life and that you will guide and direct and you will heal him in your good time.
[time=1513] And we ask Lord for good reports if it be your will throughout this week.
[time=1517] If there are others about whom we don't know that are ill today and in the hospital from our family,
[time=1523] we pray that you will just encourage them and strengthen their bodies right now.
[time=1529] Thank you for our family of believers who are faithful in praying for one another.
[time=1534] We pray that that will continue even in greater force this week.
[time=1538] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1542] I hear so many of you talk about praying for Black Hawk Baptist Church and for individual people
[time=1548] and your ABFs and we're really grateful for that.
[time=1551] We want to thank you again as a staff for your great support and encouragement throughout the weeks as you have encouraged us giving us suggestions, some good ideas that we can implement
[time=1562] for the betterment of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1565] We're really very pleased to have with us Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=1568] If you've been around Black Hawk for a while, you'll know that he was a part of our staff here for about five years and left in 1983 to go to Richland, Washington.
[time=1577] And for a number of years now has been in the San Diego, California area, working in the Alive Consoling Ministries there in Christian Heritage College.
[time=1585] He's part of the staff along with Dr. David Jeremiah at Scott Memorial Baptist Church in Oklahoma, California.
[time=1592] He has a great message for us today and that will continue on next week, so set your calendars that you'll be with us.
[time=1599] Let's give Dr. Ken a good Black Hawk welcome as he comes to the program.
[time=1603] (Applause)
[time=1611] I bring you greetings from our family who wanted to be with me this time for our visit because it's obviously Black Hawk Baptist Church has a very special place in our hearts.
[time=1621] We have a deep gratitude and love for the ministry here.
[time=1624] God allowed us the years of ministry which were delightful.
[time=1628] My son Mark is a senior this coming year at Christian Heritage College, graduating as a business major.
[time=1634] My daughter Kendra will be a junior at Christian Heritage College.
[time=1637] She's majoring in Counseling and Home Economics.
[time=1640] And then my younger daughter Kara will be going into the fifth grade.
[time=1643] Marlene continues to participate in the music program and plays the organ at the church from time to time and sings.
[time=1650] And of course my great love is to be involved in teaching.
[time=1653] I'd love to teach at Christian Heritage College in the area of Counseling.
[time=1657] But thank you so much for the invitation to be here today and then again next week.
[time=1661] Now I need to tell you that the structure that we've used here is that in these two lesson series both this morning and next Sunday morning as well as tonight and next Sunday night you need to come back.
[time=1672] Because today we want to talk about the problems and then next week we want to talk about the principles.
[time=1677] So I don't want you to just be able to come for one message and get discouraged.
[time=1681] I want you to be able to get the full impression of our intention in these series.
[time=1685] The title of the message today is "Age Old Truth for New Age Times."
[time=1691] I want you to understand that I come today not with necessarily a word of encouragement or how to be a successful, happy Christian.
[time=1699] I believe that the context of our message today is absolutely, positively, irrevocably, and alterably an urgent message for believers today.
[time=1708] You must be introduced to the New Age movement and its various organizations and strategies
[time=1715] because it is my belief, and I will demonstrate later this morning, it is my belief that behind many of the activities of the New Age movement
[time=1725] is the adversary, the devil, who goes about like a roaring lion
[time=1731] seeking whom he may devour.
[time=1734] We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and spiritual wickedness and supernatural power.
[time=1744] And I believe that Satan is cleverly and cunningly preparing in these last days
[time=1750] the kind of setting that is absolutely essential in the world for the presentation of the Antichrist.
[time=1758] Now I need to say parenthetically, I'm not on a hate campaign against New Ageers.
[time=1763] I don't believe that many of the New Age activities are in and of themselves evil or wrong.
[time=1770] It would be a fair assumption on my part that the greater percentage of people who are championing the New Age agenda are sincere, well educated, capable people
[time=1782] who because their hearts and minds have been blinded to the truth are doing all that they can to improve the world's condition.
[time=1792] Now you need to understand something about the New Age agenda.
[time=1795] There is a light side and a dark side of the New Age agenda.
[time=1799] Let me explain that briefly.
[time=1801] On the light side of the New Age agenda, we're talking about politics and government and education and dealing with the world hunger problem
[time=1811] and world religion and world peace and unification of the world's resources and unification of the world's governments.
[time=1819] They are by and large positive, sincere, well orchestrated efforts at dealing with the problems in life.
[time=1826] Now how can we be oppositional to some of those things?
[time=1829] I mean as a conservative Christian you don't want to stand in the pulpit and say I'm personally not for peace.
[time=1835] I mean that doesn't go over real well.
[time=1838] So we have to recognize that on the light side of the New Age agenda there are some things that are very obviously helpful.
[time=1844] However you need to understand that on the dark side of the New Age agenda it is fundamentally based upon Eastern religion and Eastern philosophy
[time=1854] and is also very clearly based upon the occult.
[time=1858] It is spiritual wickedness manifested in a very unique and clever way
[time=1864] and I believe orchestrated by Satan who is our adversary.
[time=1869] Now as we get into our message this morning I want you to turn in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 24 and you follow along as I reference a few verses there to give us a frame of reference for our study.
[time=1883] Have you ever wondered why God told us so many stories in the Old Testament and Jesus told us so many stories in the New Testament?
[time=1893] I believe that the purpose for the stories that were taught in the scriptures is to enable us to more fully appreciate and understand complex truth.
[time=1903] God uses the ability of our mind and imagination to sort through some of the complexity and he tells us a story that we can get a hold of through our imagination and thereby understand the truth.
[time=1914] For our study both this morning and tonight and the next week I want you to use the frame of reference as a soldier, a warfare.
[time=1923] Allow your imagination to think what it's like to be a called one of God to be involved in spiritual warfare, to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ and to be adequately equipped and prepared particularly in these days where the adversary and his strategies are so complex.
[time=1943] Now look in Matthew chapter 24.
[time=1947] Verse 3, "Now as he said on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately saying, 'Tell us, where will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?' Even in that time they had curious questions about how in the world do we know that the clock of time is ticking down?
[time=1964] How can I understand that truly the end times are near and so they were inquiring about that?
[time=1970] Jesus said to them, 'Take heed that no one deceives you.
[time=1975] For many will come in my name saying, 'I am the Christ and many will be deceived,
[time=1981] and you will hear of wars and rumors of war, see that you are not troubled.
[time=1986] For all of these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.'" Look at verse 11, "Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many."
[time=1998] Look at verse 23, "Then if anyone says to you, 'Look here, it is the Christ, or there, do not believe it.
[time=2006] For false Christ and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
[time=2015] The new age agenda has an uncanny appeal, yay, even to Christians.
[time=2021] And there are many believers today who, little by little, are being captured by the popularity of the movement and the promises of the movement." Now, turn to another passage of Scripture, 2 Corinthians chapter 11, if you will.
[time=2044] Verse 3, "But I fear, lest somehow as the serpent deceive thee by his craftiness,
[time=2050] so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." Look at verse 13, "For such are false apostles, deceitful workers,
[time=2062] transforming themselves in the apostles of Christ." Now, watch this, "And no wonder, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.
[time=2072] Therefore, why are we so amazed if his apostles and his prophets also
[time=2078] transform themselves into angels of light?" Perhaps more than any other time in history what John penned in 1 John, the timetable is very apparent that the preparation for the presentation of the Antichrist
[time=2094] and much of the new age movement in the new age agenda is getting this world ready to accept signs and wonders and great powers and phenomena
[time=2106] and having the needs of the world attended to by a special leader.
[time=2112] I believe those are the kind of times that we are facing today.
[time=2116] Now, there are two key words that will guide our study together this morning.
[time=2119] I want to first of all talk about Satan's strategy through the new age agenda, and the key word is "infiltration." The idea of infiltration is the ability to get behind the enemy's line undetected
[time=2133] and to do destructive damage from within to infiltrate and weaken and discourage the Christian population
[time=2143] and to infiltrate people's minds and hearts and imagination in a subtle and clever and cunning fashion so that they are not aware of the deception.
[time=2154] Listen to this.
[time=2156] If you are truly deceived, it is without your awareness.
[time=2162] Otherwise, it's not deception.
[time=2168] If we are truly fooled and deceived by some of these modern technologies
[time=2174] and modern offers of the adversary, we're not sensitive to it, and we'll address that in just a minute.
[time=2180] So the first primary strategy that Satan uses to cause to propagate the new age agenda and to cause defeat is deception.
[time=2192] Let me reveal the master motive of infiltration.
[time=2197] The story of the Gibeonites found in Joshua chapter 9 will illustrate that for us.
[time=2202] You recall that throughout biblical history, God gave repeated warnings about infiltration of the enemy.
[time=2208] Don't intermerry.
[time=2209] Don't allow them to be a part of the work of the children of Israel and God's work, but the Gibeonites were very clever, tricky people.
[time=2216] You recall that they came to the leadership team of the children of Israel and they pretended to be from a great country far away.
[time=2224] Oh, they wore old clothes and they had old food and they had the appearance.
[time=2229] They had not been shaven for an extended period of time and they came into the presence of the leadership and they told this story that we have come from a far country and we have heard of your great God and we want to serve him and to be a part of this thing.
[time=2244] And the Bible says in Joshua chapter 9 verse 9, "They did not inquire of the Lord." Now watch this.
[time=2253] "In order to detect deception, you must appreciate the master motive
[time=2259] of who you're dealing with.
[time=2261] You must understand that absolutely from the beginning of time, the motive of Satan has always been to deceive.
[time=2270] Is that not how he brought us into the fall into sin?" It was through his clever strategy of deception, the master motive by the adversary through the new age agenda is deception.
[time=2284] Let me talk for a few minutes about the modern method of infiltration.
[time=2289] You'll be surprised, perhaps, but maybe not surprised, but the modern method of infiltration today is identical to what Satan has always done.
[time=2299] Age old truth for new age time.
[time=2301] There is nothing new about his strategy.
[time=2303] It is just packaged more cleverly and creatively under the guise of the so-called new age movement.
[time=2311] In a book by Erwin Luther, he talks about the four spiritual flaws.
[time=2316] Listen to these.
[time=2318] Number one, you will be like God.
[time=2321] Is that not what the serpent said to Eve?
[time=2324] God communicated to Eve what the truth was.
[time=2327] She knew beyond the shadow of a doubt, his intention, and then the subtle serpent came in and tempted her by cleverly reworking God's truth to his advantage.
[time=2338] And Satan said through the serpent, "You will be like God." Well, one of the major principles of the new age movement at its very core is pantheism.
[time=2348] Oh, our society has come a long way.
[time=2351] Humanism says there is no God.
[time=2353] The new age agenda says that God is everywhere and everybody is God, and everything is God.
[time=2358] That's the same lie that he told Eve, and he's telling our culture and our country today.
[time=2366] Lie number two, you will not die.
[time=2369] That's what the serpent said to Eve.
[time=2371] Well, in the new age agenda, they believe in reincarnation.
[time=2375] That simply death is just a transformation into a new life.
[time=2383] Lie number three, you will know the difference between good and evil.
[time=2387] Morality and value is relative in the new age agenda.
[time=2393] And then spiritual lie number four that Satan told Eve was, "Your eyes will be opened.
[time=2399] The incredible pursuit of extending the finite limitations imposed by God on man is an illustration of their genuine desire out of control for greater knowledge, for enlightenment, for great wisdom that exceeds the finite limitations imposed by God." Well, that's the same lie that was told in the beginning, Genesis chapter three.
[time=2423] There is no new age agenda, and certainly the strategy that the adversary uses today in spiritual warfare should be very familiar to us.
[time=2433] The appeal is identical, but the approach is creative.
[time=2440] Well, if we're going to be aware of infiltration, we need to understand first of all the master mode of, and then secondly, the modern method.
[time=2448] But the second tool that Satan is using today and I think is illustrated in the new age agenda is intimidation.
[time=2458] Now, before I get into that, let me give you a couple of, very briefly, a couple of modern-day illustrations of how these four spiritual flaws are manifested in the new age agenda.
[time=2468] Are you familiar with the name Silva?
[time=2471] Silva Mind Control is a new age technique which is explosive in this country and frankly around the world.
[time=2479] Silva has become popular because of his firm conviction that anyone that takes his 48-hour course in mind control will be able to develop psychic powers.
[time=2489] You will be taught how to enter a higher intelligence of the universe.
[time=2493] You will be taught how to invite psychic guides into your life and to help you solve all of your problems.
[time=2499] Clients can have out-of-body experiences and receive communication from the minds of other men, even deceased men.
[time=2508] Silva believes, nonetheless, that God sent Jesus into this world to teach us all of this.
[time=2514] After all, did not Jesus alter physical reality by changing water into wine?
[time=2520] Silva Mind Control is an illustration of a positive principle which is taken to extreme, desperate men trying to exceed finite boundaries, and because of that they are forced to turn to psychic, supernatural powers in order to accomplish their goals.
[time=2540] Another one is Air Hard Training Seminars.
[time=2543] It's referred to now as the Forum.
[time=2546] They acquire inner spirit guides.
[time=2548] They can intuitively diagnose health problems.
[time=2551] Dream control is one of its primary issues.
[time=2554] Mind over matter, psychic powers controlling reality through thought power, trans-induction, and various forms of meditation.
[time=2563] These are the current manifestations of the same tricks that the adversary used on Eve.
[time=2570] Some of you businessmen will be familiar with and have perhaps read the book by Napoleon Hill, "Think and Grow Rich." Napoleon Hill's book has had incredible success.
[time=2581] He attributes his success to the school of the masters.
[time=2585] His works have been communicated to him through disembodied spirit, which he refers to as spiritual guides.
[time=2593] Do you believe today in demons?
[time=2597] Do you believe that Satan is real?
[time=2600] Do you believe that the adversary goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, but he also has the appearance of the angel of light.
[time=2612] These disembodied spirits, these psychic guides are demons.
[time=2618] Folks, if we're talking about supernatural power, there are only two alternatives for the explanation.
[time=2626] And if it is not of God and it is supernatural power, it is of Satan.
[time=2633] Satan keeps many of his promises if it is convenient to his agenda.
[time=2640] Can you imagine those who do not know Jesus Christ why they would be so readily attracted to and deceived by the new age agenda?
[time=2648] It offers prosperity and power and purpose.
[time=2651] The new age agenda is a positively packaged deception that has good but limited goals.
[time=2658] Second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 and 4 says,
[time=2670] "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but our mighty." This is warfare, and you cannot be involved in spiritual warfare unless you're keenly aware of the spiritual strategies which are being imposed on us.
[time=2688] Well, let me talk now for a few minutes about the second major strategy that Satan uses.
[time=2693] Number one was infiltration.
[time=2695] The master motive and the modern method.
[time=2697] And number two is intimidation.
[time=2699] Right after high school, I went into the army and I was involved in army intelligence.
[time=2703] And I had a top secret clearance.
[time=2706] I took my training at Fort Halliburton, Baltimore, Maryland.
[time=2709] The interesting thing about the intelligence training was that one major aspect was psychological warfare.
[time=2717] The advantages that you could have in any kind of warfare strategy
[time=2723] could be attributed to your ability to intimidate the enemy.
[time=2727] By the way, the very word means to cause to be timid, to manipulate with fear.
[time=2733] That's what intimidation means.
[time=2735] Can you imagine then the advantage in spiritual warfare or adversary is able to intimidate this world and culture to buy into his agenda?
[time=2745] Can I give you a couple of illustrations of how intimidation works?
[time=2750] What about the question of homosexuality?
[time=2753] What has happened over the last decade?
[time=2755] Well, high-profile, very well-known prophets and speakers
[time=2762] all over the world have given carte blanche approval.
[time=2766] The higher the profile of the man, the greater the impact of the message.
[time=2772] And there are people that are coming on our media and the newspapers and they're saying, "Homosexuality isn't the issue." I just had this driven home recently from a television commentary.
[time=2783] There are two gay women standing being interviewed by the news commentary.
[time=2786] They had their arms around each other and they were just ordained for the ministry.
[time=2791] And they're saying to the audience, "The issue here today is not homosexuality.
[time=2796] The issue here today is the honesty of the church." I thought that was rather clever.
[time=2803] And so everybody got in a debate on whether the church should be honest about ordaining homosexuals.
[time=2809] The issue has always been that homosexuality is sin and it's immoral, and that issue has been God breathed and will not change.
[time=2821] But we're intimidated to believe, well, we need to be compassionate.
[time=2825] I think compassion is appropriate.
[time=2829] I think dealing with sin is appropriate, but immorality has never been, never willed be acceptable to God's agenda.
[time=2837] Well, I could list many other current cultural things that have clearly, cleverly over the last decade, been put into place through intimidation.
[time=2846] You can't argue with it.
[time=2851] There are two ways that Satan uses intimidation.
[time=2854] One is the declaration of people, and the second one is the demonstration of powers.
[time=2863] Mark chapter 13 verse 22 says, "For false Christ and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive." Watch this.
[time=2872] False prophets and false Christ, the declaration of people, and great signs and great wonders, the demonstration of power is what Satan uses to intimidate the believer, not to be aggressive in spiritual warfare, and to cause the nonbeliever not to know the truth.
[time=2897] Probably one of the most popular spokesmen for the New Age movement is Shirley McLean.
[time=2903] The declaration of high profile people remember the higher, the profile of the man, the greater the impact of the message, and she's been going around proclaiming the New Age agenda.
[time=2913] Let's compare what Shirley McLean has said recently in light of the four spiritual flaws, or the basic method for deception used by Satan.
[time=2922] Number one, you will be like God.
[time=2924] Shirley McLean says, "We already know everything.
[time=2927] Everythingness of our own divinity is the highest intelligence." Spiritual flaw number two, you will surely not die.
[time=2936] She says death is nothing to be feared because it changes nothing in one's essential personality.
[time=2941] They believe in reincarnation.
[time=2944] You will know the difference between good and evil.
[time=2946] Now, the quote I'm giving now is from another New Age spokesman,
[time=2953] but he says, "Satanism has made me a better person and what is right for me is all that really matters.
[time=2959] Morality is relative in entirely my own decision.
[time=2962] You will know the difference between good and evil." Spiritual flaw number four, your eyes will be opened.
[time=2968] And Shirley McLean once again says, and I quote, "We must leave religion behind and venture into new dimensions of higher knowledge and enlightenment." Desire out of control.
[time=2979] These people need our compassion and our prayer in desperate pursuit of what only God can deal with and the non-Christian can approximate but not duplicate the plan of God.
[time=2992] They are doing right things on the light side of the New Age movement which clearly illustrates their need to know the truth and the author of truth.
[time=3005] Benjamin Crem, an outspoken and widely-traveled prophet of the New Age movement says, "We are about to witness the appearance of the world in the world of the greatest of all teachers, to have evolved through the human line." In fact, in 1977, this world teacher entered a well-known country in the modern world.
[time=3021] The purpose of this new world teacher is the gradual but complete transformation of all of society.
[time=3026] Perhaps some of you remember this.
[time=3028] He put full-page ads in some of the leading newspapers in the country announcing the return of Christ.
[time=3033] Listen, the New Age movement references Christ, but it's not Jesus Christ, the sovereign God that we know of in the scriptures.
[time=3041] The New Age movement is blatantly religious on the light side but it's not the commitment that you and I have to God's truth.
[time=3049] And that's why it requires of us an incredible spiritual discernment in these times.
[time=3057] Well, another demonstration of power is not only in the spokesman but in the United Nations.
[time=3062] Robert Mueller, who has served over 30 years in the United Nations and recently is, in fact, currently as the Assistant Secretary-General, I quote, "His proclamation for a global spirituality and the coming cosmic age wherein we will become the planet of God in which we will be transcended into ever higher forms of life."
[time=3084] Another area that's incredibly powerful in the New Age agenda is psychology and parapsychology.
[time=3090] Did you know that both the Soviet Union and the United States government are spending over $6 million a year to study psychic power?
[time=3097] Charles Rose, a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, says the possibility of psychic war is all too frightening.
[time=3105] There are many other serious researchers who are convinced that psychic phenomena may well involve something potentially no less dangerous than atomic energy.
[time=3115] There are secret research projects in both governments trying to figure out how to capture supernatural psychic power to be used to their advantage.
[time=3126] They believe in it, and rightly they should because it is real.
[time=3133] David Hunt in his book, America the Sorcerer's New Apprentice,
[time=3142] refers to this intimidation of power when he says, "Sourceery's promise of magical solutions to every conceivable problem makes it almost irresistible.
[time=3151] The perpetual youth offered by yoga, the miraculous curative powers attributed to crystals or herbal tea and the eternal round of second chances guaranteed by reincarnation, are typical examples of promises which are clearly an invitation to the undistcerning to become part of the New Age agenda." There has been a resurgence of interest in the occult like never before in this country.
[time=3177] You know another area that the New Age movement is demonstrating their power's education?
[time=3182] In 1940 there were 259,000 school districts in this country.
[time=3187] Today there are 1,600 school districts, and part of the clever strategy is that by centralizing the school district districts, they have taken away the power from local school boards.
[time=3199] It is incredible to me that in this society and in our country, we are no longer permitted to pray, but they promote meditation.
[time=3210] Thank God for Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=3214] This Christian school movement today is taking on a whole new essence
[time=3220] of criticalness and importance in our society.
[time=3223] In growing numbers of schools around the country, the children are being taught now to contact their spirit guides in elementary school.
[time=3231] Euphemistically these are called their higher self or inner wisdom to help them solve the problems of life, picture your elementary school child closing his eyes under the tutoring of his teacher and meditating and asking his spirit guide to lead him.
[time=3247] It opens their mind and their heart to psychic powers and the potential that is there, but the motive for that is deception.
[time=3255] Beware, be discerning parent, be discerning believer
[time=3262] because in these days the warfare is not quite as readily detected as in years gone by.
[time=3268] Well, we find it in education.
[time=3271] Don't have time to talk about the music scenario, but that's another area that their philosophy is being marketed.
[time=3278] A new television serial called Phoenix is about an extraterrestrial shaman and Messiah up on whom the salvation of the world may depend.
[time=3285] He is endowed with awesome psychic powers, not the least of which is levitation.
[time=3290] Popular movies like Star Wars, E.T., and the Raiders of Lost Ark are part of a clever conditioning process to prepare this culture and other cultures for the presentation of the supernatural.
[time=3301] We're very comfortable with it.
[time=3303] I mean supernatural powers is seen everywhere.
[time=3306] It becomes just a very normal experience and through Saturday morning cartoons.
[time=3311] Industry and not the least of which is psychology is another leader
[time=3317] in demonstration of power of the New Age agenda.
[time=3320] Did you know that Carl Rogers, shortly after his wife Helen died, went to a chama and talked to his wife after she had died through a channel.
[time=3329] Carl Rogers is one of the leading psychologists.
[time=3333] Carl Jung, as he developed his theories of psychology watch this, attributed his success to spirit guides, demons.
[time=3342] You call him what you will, you call it psychic power, you call it positive mental attitude, give it anything you wish.
[time=3350] But there are people in our culture today who have sold their souls to the devil because of the power that he promises.
[time=3358] Well in closing, I want to just close with somewhat of an optimistic number.
[time=3366] I told you today that we'd talk primarily about the problems.
[time=3369] Follow this through once again.
[time=3371] The strategy is infiltration, you need to know the master motive and the modern method.
[time=3376] The second primary strategy is intimidation, and he does that through the declaration of people in the demonstration of power, which is manifested in the so-called New Age movement.
[time=3389] As the FBI trains their people to deal with counterfeit money,
[time=3395] their strategy of training is to constantly and repeatedly expose them to the authentic.
[time=3400] Look up here a minute.
[time=3402] If I had any good word to say today, I want to say this, age old truth for New Age time, get back to the basics, get back to the book.
[time=3410] Jesus said, I am the way the truth and the life do not be consumed with a New Age strategy.
[time=3415] It simply is a depiction of God's prophecy.
[time=3419] What is happening around us, he has warned us what happened, and so I thank God that we can commit ourselves to the authentic, to the genuine, may our hearts be at peace, and at ease in these complex times,
[time=3431] not because the war is over, but because we know who wins the war.
[time=3438] The book has told us of God's final chapter.
[time=3443] Oh, thank you, God, for your word.
[time=3445] Thank you, God, for your salvation.
[time=3447] Thank you, God, for your truth. Let's pray together.
[time=3451] Heavenly Father, we lift our hearts up to you today with a spirit of gratitude and thanksgiving.
[time=3457] We love you.
[time=3458] How much you loved us to give us this wonderful book.
[time=3463] We are not in despair.
[time=3465] We are not without hope.
[time=3467] You have given us the truth, and it is a delightful thing to be able to identify in this complex society, the very things that you have taught us about.
[time=3479] We've been sharing with you the ministry of our Sanctuary Choir, a duet by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe, and a special organ solo by our organist, Scott Schindler.
[time=3489] The message today was from our special guest, Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=3493] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3502] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, and I die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3510] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart and be my Savior.
[time=3514] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3520] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3523] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3528] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
