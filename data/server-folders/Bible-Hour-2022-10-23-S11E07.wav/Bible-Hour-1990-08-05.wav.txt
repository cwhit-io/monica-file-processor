[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - Last week we introduced you to the new age movement and spent our time particularly focusing in on the problems and how our adversary utilizes the new age movement to cause deception and to defeat the believer.
[time=43] Today in our lesson we want to ask the question, how should a Christian respond to the new age movement in order to be successful in this spiritual combat?
[time=61] Welcome to an hour of Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=66] Thank you for joining us.
[time=68] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=73] Dr. Nichols will be bringing us part two of his message entitled, "Age Old Truth for New Age Times." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=83] Special music today includes a solo from Kevin Rowe.
[time=88] And a song from the Minsinger's score cap.
[time=91] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "Heal Our Land."
[time=118] (bell ringing) [MUSIC - 235 seconds]
[time=368] - When we cry to the Lord, Jesus Christ, and he hears our need, he heals the land, he changes our lives.
[time=375] The next song we're going to sing is entitled, "He Touched Me." A number of years ago, when I was on the west coast, we did the Alleluia presentation by Bill and Gloria Gaither, and this song is in that package.
[time=387] A man nearly 80 years old sang that, and his voice wasn't as strong as it formally was, but he certainly created and communicated the message that Jesus touched him and changed his life.
[time=400] You're a Christian today.
[time=401] I hope that you can sing with that great assurance that the joy overflowed as the Lord Jesus Christ came into your life.
[time=408] Him number 504 will sing both verses one and two.
[time=413] ("Pomp and Circumstance")
[time=427] [MUSIC - 117 seconds]
[time=549] - Wonderful to know that old things are passed away behold.
[time=554] All things become new when Jesus comes into our hearts.
[time=558] Kevin Rose about to sing for us now.
[time=560] His song is entitled "The Word." Speaks of the glorious power of the word.
[time=565] How the word is alight into our feet in a lamp and to our pen.
[time=570] How it can give encouragement and strength when we're weak.
[time=573] Out that you'll pay particular attention to the text and the ministry of this song, "The Word."
[time=579] [MUSIC] The Word is moving [MUSIC] The Word is right [MUSIC] The Word delights my soul [MUSIC] Preserves my life [MUSIC] Holy and given [MUSIC] Forever true [MUSIC] The perfect sacrifice [MUSIC] Our love [MUSIC] Jesus calls [MUSIC] The Word is resigned [MUSIC] The Word is true [MUSIC] The Word is all that's done [MUSIC] And makes it new [MUSIC] When hearts are broken [MUSIC] He makes them whole [MUSIC] The one who paid the price [MUSIC] Our Lord [MUSIC] Jesus calls [MUSIC]
[time=685] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=733] I'm so pleased that you joined us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=736] This has been a special week in that I had the privilege of meeting one of our Bible Hour viewers.
[time=741] She's in the hospital, unfortunately, and her name is Mrs. Swartz.
[time=745] She's 80 years old, and she had a fall this week and broke her leg.
[time=749] We're hoping that Mrs. Swartz is recuperating well and will be back to normal very soon.
[time=754] We also heard from some others of you that said you had needs, that you were lonely, that you needed prayer,
[time=760] and we appreciate those prayer requests.
[time=762] If you have a need this week, would you write us and tell us about your situation?
[time=767] We'd be glad to call you or write to you and encourage you in some way this week.
[time=772] Our speaker on July 29th will be one of our own associates, Pastor Tim Teder.
[time=778] Tim Teder is responsible for our youth ministries and does an outstanding job in that area, and we'll be preaching next Sunday.
[time=785] Also on July 29th, at 6 p.m. in the evening, we will have the White family with us.
[time=791] Mr. and Mrs. White, along with their five children, will be singing.
[time=795] They have a great enthusiastic concert, and it'll be a great enjoyment to you.
[time=800] Please mark that date July 29th at 6 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=807] In two weeks, we will have a guest that has a real friend of mine from Salem, Oregon.
[time=813] I formally taught out there and got acquainted with Phil Nash.
[time=817] Phil Nash is a dramatist, and he'll be with us.
[time=820] He usually takes a passage of Scripture and dresses up like the writer and reviews that passage of Scripture for us.
[time=829] For instance, Paul is very interesting in his prison epistles, and he reviews for us the content of his letters.
[time=837] So I hope that you will mark that date too.
[time=839] In two weeks, we will have with us Phil Nash.
[time=842] We're glad to welcome back to the studio and into our service today, Dr. Ken Nichols.
[time=848] Good morning, Ken.
[time=850] You'll recall if you were watching last week that Ken spoke, and he's finishing his series on the New Age movement.
[time=856] Ken, can you just give us a little synopsis of what you might be saying today?
[time=859] Well, I think today's lesson is so critical because as you recall last week, we talked about the problems.
[time=865] And if somebody just heard last week's message, it could be very, very awesome to think about all of the things that our adversary is doing
[time=873] and all of the strategies of spiritual warfare.
[time=876] Today is good news.
[time=877] Today we'll comfort our heart and challenge believers to understand how should I respond to the New Age movement?
[time=884] And the Bible is very, very clear on that.
[time=886] So it should be kind of exciting.
[time=887] Well, there are a number of situations that come up new, excuse me, new religions, cults that might be there,
[time=894] but we praise the Lord that those scriptures says that God never changes, and that is age-old truth for a new age.
[time=901] Ken, we talked also about the live counseling ministry.
[time=905] That's been around for a number of years, though you've changed locations.
[time=908] You have a very vital ministry as it relates to counseling to people in this hurting world.
[time=914] A live counseling ministry has actually started about 10 years ago, as you know, right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=920] It was the vision of the board and the church and the pastor to be able to minister effectively to people in the community
[time=926] and in the church regarding the counseling needs.
[time=929] Last year in April, we had our 10th year board meeting here at the church.
[time=934] And in the board summary, Pete, you'd be interested to know that just with the few people that are on the team of a live counseling ministries,
[time=942] the men provided over $58,000 worth of reduced fee and free service to those in the Christian community that could perhaps otherwise not have received help.
[time=953] Well, Ken, while you're out in San Diego, California with the live counseling ministries, we do have a vital counseling ministry right here with our own Lloyd Hicks, and we're grateful for the help that he's given so many of our people.
[time=966] And you're also involved. In fact, Vice President of Christian Heritage College, so that certainly keeps you busy too, does it not?
[time=973] It does indeed. I'm involved with the students in a very direct way in terms of administration, but I think probably my greatest love, Pete, is to be in the classroom.
[time=981] I love to teach. I love to be involved with the students, and so that's why I'm involved in the ministry there now.
[time=986] Well, we got to know one another when we were both teaching at a college, and I have to admit to you too, there are some times when those pangs come back when I really did enjoy the classroom.
[time=996] It's a wonderful, vital, alive situation to work with those young people. We're glad you're here today, Ken, and we look forward in a few minutes to your message.
[time=1004] We want to offer you a cassette that we've been talking about for the last three weeks.
[time=1009] It's entitled "Dina Moments in James" by Dr. Warren Wiersby. This is 31 about three-minute little meditations that will encourage you from the Book of James.
[time=1021] If you don't want to get on fire for the Lord and you don't want to serve him, you probably ought not to write for this cassette because it really is a great study in the Book of James.
[time=1030] I hope that you'll write for it. It's free. Please write to the Bible Hour today at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1038] and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1052] We appreciate hearing from you. Thank you for writing to us, and we hope that we hear from some of you this week.
[time=1058] We go back now to the live portion of our service. I hope God will bless in the remaining moments that we have with you.
[time=1068] [MUSIC]
[time=1083] Life is moving faster than it ever has before.
[time=1090] What tomorrow brings us isn't certain anymore. So many paths from which to choose don't know which way to run.
[time=1104] 'Cause every road leads nowhere, every road except for one raised the one.
[time=1120] He never changes. I come to him. He's always there.
[time=1132] He comes towards me on every level.
[time=1139] Takes the burdens that I bear. Praise the Lord. He never changes. He's never any other way.
[time=1160] And he will be the same. Tomorrow, as he was, and he is today.
[time=1178] Friends and faces come and go like ashes in the wind. Attitude to rise that I don't fully understand.
[time=1192] The things that you can come upon grow fewer every day. But when the number gets too hard, that one will show the way.
[time=1209] Praise the Lord. He never changes. I come to him. He's always there.
[time=1228] He comes towards me on every level. Takes the burdens that I bear. Praise the Lord. He never changes. He's never any other way.
[time=1256] And he will be the same. Tomorrow, as he was, and he is today.
[time=1300] Would you just buy your heads with me, please? It's a privilege to look over the audience and see people that have gone through real struggles.
[time=1317] People with whom we've prayed and that you've prayed for. I want to encourage you today to be faithful to our congregation.
[time=1325] When you know of hurts, not only physically but emotionally, that we join together with our prayer chains with individual friends and pray for these people.
[time=1335] A middle lady in the hospital yesterday, she's 80 years old, Mrs. Swartz fell a couple days ago and broke her leg.
[time=1343] She watches the Bible hour very faithfully but can't get out of her home and had the chance to pray with her and ask the Lord to strengthen her body.
[time=1352] We've had good news with Marv Eastland and he is recuperating well. It'll be a number of days yet before he's released from the hospital but we rejoice in your prayers and asking the Lord to heal his body.
[time=1364] Jim Hindle Sr needs our prayers as well as Harold Meiser and there are others I'm sure in our congregation about which we don't know.
[time=1374] Let's bow in prayer right now. Our Father, we thank you for this worship service.
[time=1379] And Lord as we sing that song and we realize that you're the only strength that stays sturdy and the only rock upon which we can stand.
[time=1388] And when we waver with every issue that comes along and we're swayed so easily, we thank you that we have a stalwart strength in Jesus Christ.
[time=1399] We also are thankful that you're our comfort and while those that are still hurting from past situations in their lives, from loss of loved ones, we pray that you'll continue to strengthen their lives.
[time=1410] And those that are in the hospital today, we pray that you'll just strengthen their bodies and bring them back to good health again.
[time=1417] Pray for Mrs. Swartz that you'll heal her body and strengthen her. She's so very weak right now.
[time=1423] I thank you for the report of Marviesland, continue to heal his body and bring him back with us.
[time=1429] Now we're so very thankful for Ken Nichols and his ministry not only at Blackhawk Weewings here, but in other areas where he's had the chance to minister and encourage the lives of people.
[time=1439] We know he's been needed and he has given strength to people through you and through his faithful study of the Word.
[time=1446] We pray that you'll bless him as he speaks to us today and that our hearts will be open to what he has to say in Jesus precious name, we pray. Amen.
[time=1455] Ken?
[time=1462] Just a few weeks ago in San Diego, California, over 90,000 people gathered together in the new San Diego Convention Center and the purpose for their gathering was the New Age Movement.
[time=1472] We were trying to develop the agenda for the continuation of what they are, the accomplishment of their platform.
[time=1479] It was interesting as I read over the table of contents of the program, I noticed that one of their keynote speakers was Kevin Ryerson.
[time=1486] Now Kevin as you may or may not recall was the Spiritual Medium or Channel that has provided services for Shirley McLean and Timothy Leary and others.
[time=1496] And he was one of the keynote speakers in the conference, but as I looked over the table of contents, it was just amazing to me to be reminded again that those who are involved in the New Age Movement on the light side are those who are by and large genuine, sincere, seeking people
[time=1513] who seem to have all of the pieces of the puzzle but are unable to formulate, at least in accordance to God's design, are unable to formulate what is the purpose of life
[time=1524] and how should I deal with the problems of life.
[time=1528] A true story was told about a couple of friends who were always playing practical jokes on one another and they challenged each other to see who would be able to complete a 2,000 piece puzzle more quickly.
[time=1541] Well the one guy took the puzzle and he took the top of the box off and replaced it with another picture and then covered it with saran wrap and sealed it and gave the impression that the picture and the pieces were the same but they were not.
[time=1555] So he gave the new box puzzle to his friend and challenged him to see how long it would take him to put together and he wore himself out in a hopeless struggle because he couldn't make a match, it wasn't the right picture.
[time=1567] And in many ways that captures the essence of the New Age Movement.
[time=1571] They're asking the right questions, they have in their heart a God-given dynamic and need to understand this complex world.
[time=1580] They're responding in all sincerity to the problems of this world but Satan who is the master of deceit and the father of lies has played a very evil trick on him.
[time=1592] He has changed the box top picture and they are in pursuit of a purpose in life that is not consistent with the wonderful Word of God.
[time=1602] You know one of the most miraculous illustrations of that recently in San Diego, there was a New Age church, that was their platform, that's the way they presented themselves to the community and there were about 300 members in this New Age church.
[time=1616] This happened only months ago and the pastor of the New Age church attended an evangelical conference.
[time=1624] He wanted to learn some new methodology and techniques in the ministry, he attended this evangelical conference and as a result of that came to know Jesus Christ as his personal Savior.
[time=1636] He was remarkably regenerated because of the impact of the pulpit and the message. Now watch this, he went back to his church and he began to preach from the Bible.
[time=1646] And out of that almost 300 membership, 235 people over a period of weeks committed their heart and life to Jesus Christ.
[time=1656] They were sincere seekers, why? They were faithful week after week, they would come into the church and they would carry a Bible and they would talk to each other about God and the needs of this world.
[time=1665] But you see as we pointed out last week, the adversary who goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he made of ours also a very subtle serpent and has evil strategies to blind the hearts and minds of men.
[time=1681] As a matter of fact, he probably promotes religion. As a matter of fact, he's probably pleased when people are religious in their activity as long as they do not come to know the authentic truth.
[time=1694] And thereby come to know Christ as their Savior.
[time=1699] As we get into our lesson today, I think it would be a good thing for us to review just briefly for those of you who are not able to be here last Sunday.
[time=1706] The frame of reference for our study about the New Age movement, first of all, is spiritual warfare.
[time=1713] For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickedness and principalities and evil powers.
[time=1720] The Bible warns us that in these times we will be dealing with supernatural power which is behind the orchestration of the New Age movement.
[time=1730] I believe that with all of my heart.
[time=1732] So as we come to our study together, we recognize that Satan's strategy, first of all, was to infiltrate, getting behind the enemy's line undetected.
[time=1742] And then secondly, not only was it his plan to infiltrate, but Satan utilizes the strategy in the New Age agenda to intimidate, to manipulate with fear.
[time=1754] And so people all around the world are being infiltrated, true believers, and many who are true seekers, and others are being intimidated to buy into the New Age agenda because of the declaration of people and the demonstration of power.
[time=1769] The New Age agenda works.
[time=1774] The New Age agenda can be understood as a major contributor to phenomenal human success in corporations and individually.
[time=1783] It works.
[time=1785] And so that is part of the attraction of the New Age agenda and part, I believe, also of the deceit.
[time=1791] Now, one of the ways that Satan tries to defeat us is by utilizing misinformation.
[time=1799] It's the ability to take truth and then cleverly rework it in such a way so as not to alarm us or to disarm us, but at the same time to deceive.
[time=1808] Let me illustrate.
[time=1809] Remember how he defeated Eve in the Garden of Eden.
[time=1813] He took a basic statement of truth and then cleverly repackaged it in such a way so as to give a wrong impression.
[time=1819] And so Eve responded, in her own mind and imagination, to God's truth, and then to Satan's restatement of truth, which was cleverly repackaged and disguised, and that led her to fall into sin.
[time=1832] So you see the adversary tried to trick Eve.
[time=1836] In fact, did trick Eve through the misuse of truth, misinformation.
[time=1841] Another Bible illustration perhaps that we're familiar with is Jesus Christ.
[time=1846] How was it that our adversary attempted to defeat Jesus Christ in the temptation?
[time=1853] It was through the clever reworking of truth.
[time=1858] The adversary confronted Christ with Scripture, which was cleverly reworked so as to give a wrong impression.
[time=1866] Another illustration that all of us are familiar with today is the success of the calls.
[time=1872] I'm certain that you've had that occasion where somebody will come to your door and knock on the door and they just have this glow about them and have a Bible under their arm.
[time=1881] And they walk into your house and you have a great time of fellowship and they talk about God and Jesus Christ and salvation.
[time=1888] In my, you're just feeling so comfortable and so relaxed because they are presenting, watch this, a form of truth.
[time=1897] And by utilizing truth creatively and cleverly, they disarm those who are undiscerning and you become entrapped for all of your life in a cult.
[time=1906] Have you ever tried to rescue someone from a cult?
[time=1910] Well, the reason that they are difficult to reach is because every cult that has significant success must have a large portion of truth reworked cleverly so as to disguise the deception.
[time=1923] Well, Satan is the master of deceit in the father of lies and we find that in this new age strategy, probably one of the most complex schemes that we have personally been familiar with and certainly the most dramatic in our day.
[time=1937] Now, let me encourage your heart. What is a believer to do?
[time=1941] How should I respond to this new age movement?
[time=1944] It's interesting, some of you after last week because of your personality, you have already formed clubs to stamp out the new age movement.
[time=1951] I mean, you're going to attack the new age movement and do away with it.
[time=1955] Parenthetically, I need to mention that, you know, the prophecy talks about the end times and part of the new age strategy certainly is clearly identified in eschatology.
[time=1964] So for you to come out and attack the new age movement really isn't a reasonable response.
[time=1969] Others of you by your personality style are going to be very, very passive and compliant.
[time=1974] In fact, you're a little bit angry at me because I talked to you last week about the new age movement.
[time=1978] You were going pretty good in life until you heard how bad things were last week.
[time=1982] And so you just want to continue sort of a passive attitude and you don't want to get involved.
[time=1988] Others of you are going to be paranoid in your response.
[time=1991] Some of the material that I used last week probably brought your attention to a new level of understanding about some of these things.
[time=1998] And so you are seeing the new age movement everywhere.
[time=2001] You can't escape its influence, you can't attack it, you can't counter-attack, you can't stop its progress.
[time=2008] What is a believer to do in light of that?
[time=2011] I've often said in the counseling office, more important than the circumstances in life is your response to life circumstances.
[time=2018] We cannot undo what we are currently facing in this day and an exaggerated fearful response is not appropriate.
[time=2027] But what we need to do is regulate our response to the new age strategy based on supernatural resources, age-old truth for new age times.
[time=2039] There are two principles I want to talk about this morning and recommend by way of suggestion for the believer's response to the new age movement.
[time=2046] The first one has to do with information.
[time=2049] You cannot do warfare well unless you are a student of the book.
[time=2056] Unless you become an expert and knowledgeable about truth, how in the world can you ever expect to detect error or a lie unless you know the truth?
[time=2066] And so my recommendation is that we become, once again, students of the wonderful living Word of God, this book is truth.
[time=2075] And as we gain information from this book, we are better equipped to respond to the complexity of all the things that we are trying to deal with today in this society and around the world.
[time=2086] Information provides direction. This book gives us direction in on how we ought to live from day to day.
[time=2096] Exodus 23.20 says, "Behold, I send angels before you to keep you in the way and to bring you to the place which I have prepared."
[time=2104] Isaiah chapter 30 verse 21 says, "Your ears will hear a word behind you saying, this is the way walking in it."
[time=2116] You're familiar, I'm sure with Psalm 119 and all of the scriptures that challenge us about the value of the Word, it is a light to my path.
[time=2126] This book provides direction. This is the information source that we need today as we deal with the New Age movement.
[time=2136] Proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 and 6 says, "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, lean not to thine own understanding, but in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."
[time=2148] You look in the Old Testament over and over again, you found the children of Israel in a spirit of despair and desperation, and repeatedly God would say, "Here I am, I will be with you, I will lead you, I will show you the way."
[time=2164] It was that simply what was behind symbolically and practically of the fire by night and the cloud by day. What was God doing?
[time=2174] "Follow me, trust me, I can give you direction for life."
[time=2182] So a wise person in response to the New Age movement would gather information from the truth because the information gives direction.
[time=2191] Secondly, not only does information provide direction, information produces discipline.
[time=2199] Another very, very important characteristic of a good soldier of Jesus Christ is a disciplined life.
[time=2204] Perhaps what Paul was referring to when I press toward the mark of the High Call of God, I bring my body into subjection.
[time=2211] I will discipline myself. Perhaps Moses in the same context said, "I would prefer to be obedient to God and to subject myself to his authority."
[time=2221] Then all of the good things that the other world has to offer for me, I must be a disciplined soldier if I'm going to have success.
[time=2229] You know, discipline just simply means that I have the ability supernaturally to have increased self-control.
[time=2237] One aspect of the fruit of the spirit is self-control. I must be able to be a disciplined soldier of Jesus Christ.
[time=2247] Let me give you probably one of the most classic illustrations of that. It's a true story about a marathon runner.
[time=2253] When he was a young man, he dreamed often about running in the New York Marathon.
[time=2257] He went to the Vietnam War and had a tragic, tragic consequence to the war and lost both of his legs.
[time=2264] He was just totally devastated physically and psychologically.
[time=2269] But he went through years of agonizing psychological rehabilitation and physical rehabilitation and just a few years ago, Bob Wheeling from Pasadena, California, ran in the New York Marathon.
[time=2281] How did he do it? We had leather chaps on his hands and on the stumps of his legs.
[time=2287] And little by little, he would swing his torso back and forth, back and forth.
[time=2293] An average runner might go around three hours in a marathon and it took Bob Wheeling five days, two hours.
[time=2302] He finished 19,413th. He was totally last.
[time=2308] But he won the hearts and minds of those in New York because he did it.
[time=2312] He knew what he wanted to do, and he was willing to subject his body to the discipline that was required.
[time=2317] And Bob Wheeling is a born-again Christian, and he said, "I knew that through the power of God and his grace in my behalf, I could accomplish that."
[time=2325] Well, you know what? There is no premium on slothfulness today.
[time=2329] Some of you don't even know there's a warfare going on.
[time=2332] You don't understand the urgency of disciplining your mind and your body and your heart to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[time=2340] A third characteristic that's absolutely essential as we think about information.
[time=2344] Not only does information provide direction and it promotes discipline, but thirdly, it produces determination.
[time=2353] Now, direction says, "I know where I'm going." Discipline says, "I'm willing to pay the price." And determination says, "I will not quit." I'm going to keep on keeping on in this day because I am a called one.
[time=2370] I am anointed and appointed by God to be involved in spiritual ministry, spiritual living, spiritual warfare, and I will not quit.
[time=2380] Now, there may be times when I wish to quit.
[time=2383] There may be times when I feel like that is so very attractive because of the stress and the press of warfare.
[time=2391] But according to the directions given to me through this wonderful book of information, I need to have an attitude of determination.
[time=2399] And that just simply means, "I will not quit." Well, think with me about these three characteristics.
[time=2406] First of all, the first principle is information.
[time=2408] Information, direction, discipline, and determination.
[time=2412] Perhaps one of the best Bible illustrations that we're familiar with would be the testimony of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=2418] Now, in Mark chapter 12, or in John chapter 12, it says, "My soul is troubled.
[time=2424] Shall I ask to be saved from this hour?" But it was for this purpose that I came.
[time=2430] If you've studied the gospel regarding the last hours of our Savior on this world, in this earth, he cried out, and he agonized,
[time=2438] and he was filled with despair, and he cried out, "Oh God, if there be any other way, let this cup pass from me."
[time=2445] And then he said, "But it was for this purpose that I came."
[time=2451] Jesus Christ had direction.
[time=2454] He knew where he was gone.
[time=2456] Jesus Christ had discipline, he was willing to pay the price.
[time=2459] And thirdly, Jesus Christ had determination, "I will not quit."
[time=2466] The second very, very important ingredient in response to the new age booma today is incorporation.
[time=2477] Information without incorporation has limited value.
[time=2482] We do not get credit in spiritual warfare for good intentions.
[time=2487] At the judgment seat of Christ, we're going to be challenged for what we did, not for what we intended to do.
[time=2493] And if you want to stand against the wiles of the devil in these complex days, you must not only know the truth,
[time=2500] but you must be consistent and faithful in making application of the truth.
[time=2505] Do what is right.
[time=2507] Be obedient.
[time=2508] The adversary hates obedience in the believer's life.
[time=2514] The adversary blocks obedience in the Christian's life.
[time=2520] And the Bible makes it so very, very clear that we need to be faithfully applying the truth of God day after day in our lives
[time=2528] in order to be adequately equipped to do warfare well.
[time=2538] For I know that in me that is in my flesh nothing good dwells.
[time=2543] For to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find, for the good that I will do I cannot,
[time=2550] and the evil that I wish I wasn't doing, I find myself practicing.
[time=2555] I mean, Paul knows a little bit about what it's like to live for God day after day after day,
[time=2561] to take the wonderful Word of God and its truth and make a consistent effort at application.
[time=2566] It is a tremendous challenge to do what is right and to make application of God's Word.
[time=2575] We need to incorporate God's purpose.
[time=2580] You know, I realize that what I'm saying today is at best very simplistic,
[time=2586] but I've noticed in Christian circles how eager we are to complicate the simple.
[time=2592] I want you to get the message today about doing what is right.
[time=2596] We need in order to do what is right we have to understand God's purpose and so God help us in these days to incorporate God's purpose.
[time=2605] What is His purpose?
[time=2609] From cover to cover, though there are other many, many important issues, but from cover to cover the ultimate purpose of God is to bring people who are not believers to salvation.
[time=2620] It is the gospel for God so loved the world that He sent His son Jesus Christ into the world
[time=2626] that those who need to know Him might be saved.
[time=2629] That is the ultimate purpose of God is salvation.
[time=2636] How many of you today are involved in reaching people for Christ?
[time=2645] As I travel from place to place, I have two prayers that I pray.
[time=2649] One is very evidently spiritual, you'd be proud of me.
[time=2653] The other sounds just a little bit carnal, it goes like this.
[time=2656] Now Lord, you know I'm tired and I want to study for the seminar.
[time=2660] I would love not to have a child who's never flown before in their life who loves to scream all the way from the east to the west coast or vice versa.
[time=2668] Or I would rather not sit down with somebody who just loves to talk to strangers because they're terrified about flying.
[time=2673] Could you find me a seat where I could be alone and study and meditate and rest?
[time=2678] It doesn't always go that way, but you know there's another prayer that I pray sincerely.
[time=2682] Oh God, you know that I want to be part of your program and your plan and I'm willing to serve you if there's anybody on this plane that needs to be saved.
[time=2689] Let me add them.
[time=2691] Now just I think it was about a year ago I was traveling from the west to the east coast and the plane was overbooked and people who were scheduled to be in the first class had to come back and sit with me.
[time=2704] So we're sitting there together and as I often do, I have my Bible out.
[time=2707] In fact, I always have my Bible out when I try.
[time=2710] It's a hook, a fish.
[time=2713] So I had my Bible out and I'm looking at the scriptures and getting ready for my seminar.
[time=2718] By the way, I have to share this with you parenthetically.
[time=2721] If I don't get my Bible out in the first hour or so of the long trip and they've already had their first drink, after I get my Bible out they get milk.
[time=2728] It's just incredible, you know.
[time=2730] Really makes them uncomfortable, I'm telling you.
[time=2733] They must think I'm a pope or something, I don't know.
[time=2736] Anyway, I had my Bible out, you know, and I was reading it.
[time=2739] And this lady elbows me, which was a little rude, but anyway, she elbows me.
[time=2742] And she says, "Do you have any prayers for the ill?" Well, let me check.
[time=2748] You have to admit, a rather strange question.
[time=2750] So being trained in clinical psychology, I ignored her.
[time=2753] I didn't want to say.
[time=2755] So I'm sitting there and she was persistent.
[time=2757] She elbows me again.
[time=2758] She says, "Sir, can you pray for the ill?" And I said, "You know ma'am, I don't understand your question." And she began to tell me that her and her husband were flying back from San Diego to the east coast where they lived.
[time=2768] Her husband was dying of cancer.
[time=2770] He had only a short time to live and they were seeing their family and saying goodbye.
[time=2774] And she wanted me to pray for him.
[time=2776] And I said, "Well, what is your religious orientation?" And she told me.
[time=2779] And I said, "Well, you people believe in God, don't you?" "Oh, yeah." I said, "How would you like to know from God what the Bible says about sickness and dying and to health and all of these things?" She said, "Well, sure, I'd be interested." Now, unless you think these are poor, struggling, uneducated people, she had a master's degree and was an educator and he was the third or fourth executive in a motel chain in this country.
[time=2800] So I began to, I mean, I'm telling you, I found verses, I still don't know where they are, but I found verses about suffering and pain and God's care and all, just was having a great time.
[time=2809] Well, I'm for about 30 minutes and I got a little self-conscious and I should have.
[time=2812] And I think the stewardess was afraid I was going to take up an offering.
[time=2815] But anyway, I'm sitting there, you know, and I'm preaching away and I closed the, you know, I said, "Look, I'm sorry." I said, "All you ask me to do is I pray for you, I can pray for you." But I said, "You know what, if you really are interested, let's take about a 30-minute break and after that break, I can show you from this book how you can know for sure that when you die, either soon of cancer or whenever you die, you can be with God.
[time=2836] Would you like to know that?" Sure.
[time=2839] Thirty minutes to the minute, the lady elbowed me again and they said they had to go to the bathroom, they got up and they both left.
[time=2845] I was on the aisle seat and when they come back, the lady said, "Look, would you mind sitting in the middle and telling us more about God?
[time=2850] Oh, I think I can work that in.
[time=2852] You know, we're going, can't go anyplace else." And so I took the Bible, put that little tray down and all the way across country, showed them from the Scriptures.
[time=2860] Both came to know Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=2863] I called that man before he died.
[time=2866] I got him follow-up discipleship at a local church in the east coast.
[time=2871] And I said, "You know what, I can't do anything about the reality of death." But because of God's great love and by divine appointment, I'm going to see you again sometime and you can even face death with God.
[time=2886] Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
[time=2889] I will fear no evil.
[time=2893] Well, do you know what?
[time=2894] If I get so preoccupied in carrying out the purpose of God, I'm not going to be so readily distracted from the New Age movement or all of the adversary strategies.
[time=2904] Why?
[time=2905] Because I'm doing what God has asked me to do.
[time=2907] I know what his purpose is and I'm pursuing the purpose of God and my involvement in the information and the incorporation insulates me from the wilds of the devil.
[time=2916] Some of you are slothful and you're not involved in Christian work and you're not serving Jesus Christ and you find yourself vulnerable to spiritual attack.
[time=2928] Well, not only do we need to incorporate God's purpose, we need to incorporate God's plan.
[time=2935] God's plan can be very simply stated by saying that God's plan is that we be prepared and participate in what he wants us to do.
[time=2943] Preparation is perhaps captured best in Ephesians chapter 6.
[time=2948] Therefore, take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand.
[time=2954] Stand therefore, good soldier, having girded your waste with truth, with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance.
[time=2987] Supplication for all the saints.
[time=2990] You know, a good soldier of Jesus Christ not only understands the purpose of God, but he participates in the plan of God.
[time=2996] He is equipped supernaturally with supernatural resources to stand against the evil one because he has taken on the full armor of God.
[time=3007] How ludicrous it would be in the literal warfare to have somebody go out to combat without equipment or without training or without preparation. It is foolishness.
[time=3018] The same is equally true in spiritual warfare.
[time=3024] You better get ready.
[time=3028] You better be equipped. This is warfare.
[time=3032] And you need to be an active participant in the plan of God.
[time=3035] You need to have adequate preparation for the plan of God.
[time=3041] We do this through the divine human cooperative.
[time=3043] It means you and God working together for His glory and your growth.
[time=3046] Of the 36 miracles illustrated in the Scriptures, it illustrates this idea.
[time=3051] God doing what requires supernatural power, and we doing what we are able to do.
[time=3058] Let me think with you a minute about the raising of Lazarus.
[time=3062] You remember the story. They went to the gravesite and then it was Jesus Christ who said, "Lazarus, come forth." Well, that required supernatural power.
[time=3072] But then He turned to His disciples and said, "Now take off His grave clothes and feed Him and take care of Him." The divine human cooperative recognized the wonderful supernatural resources that God has available to us, but then be a willing participant in doing our part to carry out the plan of God.
[time=3094] Well, finally, not only do we need to incorporate God's purpose and incorporate God's plan, but finally we need to incorporate God's power.
[time=3103] Do not be frightened by all that goes on around us.
[time=3108] We are the chosen ones. We are the elect.
[time=3112] We are part of God's royal priesthood.
[time=3115] Why? We share the divine nature given of God.
[time=3118] We have the presence and power of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[time=3122] No need for fear. No need to be intimidated.
[time=3126] We need to incorporate the power of God and perhaps the most classic illustration of the power of God is the power of prayer.
[time=3133] Oh, God help us, and I'm convicted in my own heart about the need to be a prayer warrior.
[time=3139] I will not have power in warfare unless I am a participant supernaturally asking God to empower me through His Spirit.
[time=3149] I need to pray.
[time=3152] In order to enjoy success in spiritual warfare.
[time=3156] And then secondly, I need to be reminded of the promises of God to be successful in spiritual warfare.
[time=3163] Jeremiah 33-3, "Call unto me, and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not." Jeremiah 32-27, "Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh.
[time=3176] Is there anything too hard for me?
[time=3179] Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding, but in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths.
[time=3186] And many of you here today have your special favorite verses of God's supernatural power." So many of the authors that I read in the New Age movement seems to attribute greater power to Satan and to discount supernatural power of God.
[time=3206] Remember I said in the first session, "Let your heart be at ease, not because the war is over, but let your heart be at ease because we have read the outcome of the war."
[time=3221] Information, age old truth for New Age time.
[time=3226] This book will give you direction, discipline and determination.
[time=3231] Incorporation, do what is right.
[time=3235] Be an obedient believer and an active participant in the purpose of God and the plan of God and the power of God.
[time=3243] These in my belief are the appropriate responses to any type of spiritual warfare.
[time=3251] It's to be faithful to these principles in the Word of God.
[time=3254] In closing this morning, let me encourage your heart because we've talked in these last two sessions about some of the senior sides of the New Age movement.
[time=3263] It's very frightening.
[time=3265] Some of the occult and some of the supernatural powers that are being demonstrated can be a little bit intimidating.
[time=3272] And then as I've talked about the principles today, it just feels overwhelming.
[time=3277] I have synthesized in just 30 minutes the summary of what God expects of us and you just kind of feel burdened down with that.
[time=3286] A true story is told about an expedition that crashed in Alaska during the putting into the oil pipeline.
[time=3292] Seven men were on the small plane and they were out doing research and an unexpected blizzard came up and down the plane.
[time=3298] It was immediately covered by snow.
[time=3300] People at the homeland thought it had Christ and they were presumed dead.
[time=3304] In fact, the headlines read that they were assumed and presumed to be dead.
[time=3308] They called in the relatives and the press.
[time=3310] Some 10 days later, these seven men showed up in the village 300 miles from the Christ site.
[time=3316] They had frostbite.
[time=3317] They were weather worn and exhausted.
[time=3320] And the interviewer said, "How in the world did you do this?
[time=3323] How did you trek some 300 miles through some of the most unforgiving terrain in the country?" He cleared his throat and he looked square in the eye of the interviewer and he said, "We didn't walk 300 miles." He said, "You didn't?
[time=3334] We walked one mile 300 times." You know, when I think of being a good soldier of Jesus Christ, I have to be reminded of the importance of patience and perseverance and doing what I know to do today one step at a time.
[time=3350] It takes forever to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ and my thoughts and in my emotions and in my lifestyle.
[time=3356] And you know what?
[time=3357] Do not be condemning of yourself if you experience difficulties and failure.
[time=3361] Is that not the nature of warfare?
[time=3364] Why are we amazed that there are casualties in warfare?
[time=3367] If you've been injured in spiritual warfare by God's grace, get up.
[time=3371] Brush yourself off and by God's grace, get back into the battle.
[time=3375] Get back to the front line and ask God for the strength to be restored so you can be a good soldier of Jesus Christ little by little.
[time=3384] One step at a time.
[time=3386] I'm going to be obedient.
[time=3388] I'm going to be a student of his word and I'm going to be equipped to do what he's called me to do in my life purpose.
[time=3394] Let's pray together.
[time=3395] Thank you Heavenly Father again today for the time of celebration that we've enjoyed this morning.
[time=3401] A celebration of your word.
[time=3403] A celebration of the privilege that is ours to make application of your word in our lives.
[time=3408] Father, I pray that the result of this message would not be to stimulate guilt or to be condemning.
[time=3414] I pray that we can be challenged each one in our spirit to be patient and persistent in what you've called us to do.
[time=3420] And then Lord, thank you for the strength and the confidence that we have that we don't have to be manipulated by the new age strategy or any other strategy that's around.
[time=3428] We are gods.
[time=3431] The great I am is with us.
[time=3434] Thank you for your great love.
[time=3436] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our Sanctuary Choir,
[time=3449] the men singers and soloist Kevin Rowe.
[time=3452] The message was from our special guest Dr. Ken Nichols from San Diego, California.
[time=3457] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3466] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3473] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3477] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3482] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3486] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3490] And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3499] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the cassette tape by Warren Wiersby, please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
