[time=85] We've often heard it said, and perhaps you've said it yourself, that prayer changes things. But when we consider the providence of God, we understand that God is sovereignly working in every circumstance to accomplish His will. And if that's true, then what implications does that have in regards to our prayers? Do our prayers really work? Are they effective? Do they accomplish anything?
[time=104] That's the question we're going to ask today and talk about as we consider God's providence and our prayers.
[time=113] [MUSIC]
[time=121] Welcome to another Bible study, Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=129] Our speaker today is Tim Teder, the Minister of Youth here at Blackhawk. Tim's message is entitled, "Probidence in Prayer and His Text is Taken from the Book of Daniel." We encourage you to study along with us as Tim shares with us what the Lord has laid on His heart.
[time=145] Our special music today includes two songs from Reflection and a solo from Lisa Reniker. We now join our service as Reflection brings us a song entitled, "Come Before Him."
[time=158] [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=200] An invitation waits for us to come into His presence to bring our joys and sorrows before Holy Lord.
[time=212] And when we wait upon our God, with honor and in reverence, He loves the perfect peace we sought that only grace affords.
[time=225] [MUSIC]
[time=253] Father waits unendingly for heart to heart commune His promises unbroken, His mercy is ever new.
[time=264] And when we meet Him face to face, in glorious reunion His words will be fulfilled to us if found His love is true.
[time=276] [MUSIC - 64 seconds]
[time=353] [APPLAUSE]
[time=359] I'd like to thank Reflection once again for the ministry today and singing that we can come before the Lord,
[time=365] regardless of our circumstances in life, we can always come to the Lord and He's there to meet our every need.
[time=371] Therefore, we can praise Him. Let's sing together number 16 in your hymnbook, number 16.
[time=376] We praise the O God, our Redeemer.
[time=379] [MUSIC]
[time=393] We praise the O God, our Redeemer.
[time=487] Thank you once again for your fine singing.
[time=490] We'll at least the Redeemer come now and sing to us. The song she's singing today is entitled "He Is Able."
[time=498] [MUSIC]
[time=513] Like peering through window bed with rain, emotions come together in the flood of darkness.
[time=531] We pray the best we can.
[time=536] Now we must leave it in His hands. Yet I know when my eyes fail to see, He is able.
[time=556] Even though it seems impossible to me, He is able.
[time=572] But if He chooses not to move in the way we pray, He would confident He's working all together for my Lord.
[time=586] And I will stand behind His world, for He is able.
[time=602] [MUSIC]
[time=609] Questions seem to haunt you all night and day. How could God allow your heart to be torn this way?
[time=626] Does He listen when you come, or is He even there at all?
[time=637] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see, He is able.
[time=652] Even though it seems impossible to me, He is able.
[time=667] But if He chooses not to move in the way we pray, He would confident He's working all together for my Lord.
[time=681] And I will stand behind His world, for He is able.
[time=695] Even though it seems impossible to me, He is able.
[time=710] I stand to face another day, and I stand behind His world, for He is able.
[time=728] [MUSIC]
[time=748] Good morning, and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=751] Pastor Kobe is away today, so I'm Steve Longbreak, the Associate Pastor responsible for the Christian School here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=759] I'm thankful that you're with us today. We're grateful to have such a good TV audience.
[time=764] And I'd just like to share a couple things with you about our school.
[time=767] We have an enrollment of more than 400 students now in grades K through 12.
[time=773] A few openings in grades K one and two as we double track those classes.
[time=779] And I'd encourage you if you're interested at all in our school to contact us.
[time=783] We have had 160 students now graduate from Blackhawk Christian.
[time=787] They're out in college at jobs, and it's a joy for me to see them in the summertime off and they come back.
[time=793] Our students are real busy in the summer, several go on missions trips.
[time=796] And I'm thankful when I get to the end of the summer like this and get ready to get back to school.
[time=801] I'm ready, and I'm sure many of our teachers are too.
[time=804] We have a tremendous faculty, people who love the Lord Jesus Christ, and who are committed to being the best professional teachers they can possibly be.
[time=812] Please call us at 4937400 if you're interested at all in enrolling a child in our Christian school.
[time=820] Or if you'd just like information about it, we'd like to share that with you.
[time=823] Please call.
[time=824] Also, I'd like to mention that we have a tape that we're offering this week, "Dina Moments and James" with Dr. Warren Wiersby.
[time=832] Please take advantage of that opportunity.
[time=834] You can write us at the Bible Hour at 7400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=842] Again, send for the tape "Dina Moments" with Dr. Warren Wiersby.
[time=846] 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=851] Also with me today, I have one of our associate pastors, Tim Teder.
[time=856] Tim has been with us a few times before and actually preached two parts of this three-part message that he's doing on the Providence of God.
[time=865] Tim, welcome.
[time=866] Really glad that you're here.
[time=867] I know you've been going through some struggles in your family since you did those messages.
[time=871] Today you're going to wrap some of that up.
[time=873] Yes, last November we had our fourth child born into our family, Alia.
[time=879] And as I began studying this sermon and series on the Providence of God,
[time=885] we realized that the illness that Alia had been born with, something very rare called Cornelia Delang syndrome,
[time=892] was kind of coming to a point of crisis in her life.
[time=896] And at the end of June, God chose to take her on June 27th, our baby Alia died at seven and a half months old.
[time=905] That's been a number of things that God has been teaching us through that whole process.
[time=909] When you're involved in a church like ours, you run into many obstacles in your Christian walk.
[time=915] It's been good for all of us to watch Tim and Connie as they've gone through the struggle of losing their child
[time=921] and yet holding fast to the truth that God is sovereign and that he loves them.
[time=926] That's been obvious.
[time=928] And I think, you know, if you think the things that God wants to teach you, and I don't know God's purposes and everything that's happened, you know, we prayed that Alia would be healed, we prayed that she would be well.
[time=938] Those things didn't happen.
[time=940] And why God allowed things to occur this way, I don't know.
[time=942] But I do know that God has been teaching us something of his sovereignty.
[time=946] It's easy to say, I believe in the Providence of God.
[time=948] But to go through something like this, at least he's been teaching me that he certainly is a God
[time=954] who cares and controls in his ways even when we don't understand our right and good.
[time=959] A number of other things too, but I just come to appreciate a new how good God is and how he really is in control of our lives and circumstances.
[time=968] I'm glad you're with us again today.
[time=970] And we're going to be joining Tim in just a few moments as he preaches on the providence of prayer
[time=976] involved in his life and the lives of us as we share what God can do from his word.
[time=982] We're ready to rejoin the Bible Hour.
[time=984] Now, reflection is singing, and we're excited to get back and hear the good music from them.
[time=989] [MUSIC - 212 seconds]
[time=1229] Father, we praise you because you are able.
[time=1233] In every circumstance of life, you can accomplish what you will because you are greater.
[time=1240] You are greater than our sin.
[time=1243] You're greater than our difficulties.
[time=1245] Your love is even greater than our love.
[time=1248] And everything you are God, and we acknowledge that this morning, and ask that from your word, you will teach us truth so that we can live differently.
[time=1261] In Christ's name, we come to you and ask these things.
[time=1265] [AMEN] As you turn to the book of Daniel, chapter 9.
[time=1274] Daniel, chapter 9, if you're not sure where to find that, turn the Old Testament Psalms and flip on a little ways.
[time=1280] Come to Ezekiel, then Daniel, followed by Hosea and Joel.
[time=1285] Daniel was a man of prayer.
[time=1289] We know that.
[time=1290] We know the story of Daniel and the lion's den when even under threat of his own life, Daniel refused to stop praying to God.
[time=1299] So it's interesting to look at Daniel's prayer to see how he viewed God and to see the kinds of things that Daniel said as he prayed.
[time=1308] As I've had opportunity to share and talk with you this summer,
[time=1314] we've talked about the providence of God, holding the hand of providence.
[time=1318] And I want to continue that theme this morning and especially consider our prayers in light of God's providence.
[time=1326] But first would you read with me, follow along as I begin, Daniel, chapter 9, beginning with the first verse.
[time=1334] In the first year of Darius, son of Xerxes, a mead by descent, who was made ruler over the Babylonian kingdom, in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet,
[time=1350] that the desolation of Jerusalem would last 70 years.
[time=1354] So I turn to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition, in fasting and in sackcloth and ashes.
[time=1361] I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed, Lord, you are the great and awesome God who keeps this covenant of love with all who love him in obey his commands.
[time=1371] We have sinned and done wrong.
[time=1373] We have been wicked and have rebelled.
[time=1375] We have turned away from your commands and laws.
[time=1378] We have not listened to your servants and prophets who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
[time=1386] And let's jump ahead to a little later on in this prayer beginning with verse 17.
[time=1390] Now our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your servant.
[time=1395] For your sake, O Lord, look with favor on your desolate sanctuary.
[time=1399] Give ear, O God, and hear, open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your name.
[time=1406] We do not make requests of you because we are righteous, but because of your great mercy.
[time=1411] O Lord, listen, O Lord, forgive, O Lord, hear and act.
[time=1416] For your sake, O my God, do not delay because your city and your people bear your name.
[time=1421] And Daniel goes on to say that while I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin in the sin of the people of Israel and making my request to the Lord my God for his holy hill, while I was still in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, he came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
[time=1439] And he instructed me and said to me, "Daniel, I have now come to give you insight and understanding.
[time=1444] As soon as you began to pray, an answer was given, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed."
[time=1452] When we look at the providence of God, and I believe Daniel has a good understanding of what providence of God means,
[time=1463] as we talked about that before, we began to understand that providence is the control of God directing everything to its appropriate goal.
[time=1475] That's the definition we gave to God's providence.
[time=1478] It's the control of God directing everything to its appropriate goal.
[time=1482] There are a number of scriptures in the Bible that talk about the providence of God, let me just mention a couple.
[time=1487] In Psalm 115 it says, "Our God is in heaven. He does what pleases him." Isaiah 46, "Remember the former things, those things of long ago.
[time=1496] I am God and there is no other. I am God. There is none like me. I make known the end from the beginning from ancient times and what is still to come."
[time=1504] And I say, "My purpose will stand and I will do all that I please." And what I have said, I will bring about what I have planned that I will do.
[time=1515] Daniel himself writes, "All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing.
[time=1519] God does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him, "What have you done?"
[time=1527] Providence is the control of God directing everything to its proper goal.
[time=1531] And when we understand the providence of God, we realize that there really is no such thing as chance.
[time=1535] There's no such thing as luck. When it comes to the workings of God, there are no mistakes and there are no surprises.
[time=1543] God is provident.
[time=1545] But when we consider God's providence, it does bring some questions to mind.
[time=1550] And one of the questions we want to talk about this morning is the question of prayer.
[time=1554] How do I understand prayer in light of God's providence?
[time=1560] Well, one thing is for sure. Prayer gives us confidence.
[time=1564] Because when we understand that our God is a sovereign God, we know that God is able to do what we ask.
[time=1572] And we can also have assurance that God will accomplish the right thing.
[time=1578] So we can have confidence in our prayer.
[time=1580] But I guess the harder question to answer is, does prayer really do anything?
[time=1585] If God is sovereign, if God is provident, and he is bringing through every circumstance his providential will, that is going to take place.
[time=1593] It will happen.
[time=1594] Then does prayer really change anything?
[time=1597] We've heard the phrase, and perhaps we've used it, prayer changes things.
[time=1602] And the question I asked this morning, does prayer really change?
[time=1608] I'm going to ask it in three regards this morning.
[time=1610] First of all, does prayer change us?
[time=1613] Secondly, does prayer change events?
[time=1617] And finally, does prayer change God?
[time=1620] First of all, does prayer change us?
[time=1623] And I answer that with an emphatic yes.
[time=1626] Prayer certainly changes us.
[time=1628] And I believe that's one of the primary reasons for prayer.
[time=1631] One of the primary effects of prayer in our life is that it changes us.
[time=1634] Looking, again in Daniel 9 at the beginning, Daniel responds to the Word and the will of God, and it drives him to action.
[time=1643] And that's one of the things prayer does to us.
[time=1646] It causes us to be active.
[time=1648] Verse 3, Daniel said, "So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and petition and fasting, and in sackcloth and ashes."
[time=1656] Now I'm sure Daniel could have read the Scripture, could have read the prophecy through Jeremiah, and could have concluded, well God has said that the desolation of Jerusalem would last 70 years.
[time=1667] Well, I guess God's going to bring it about.
[time=1669] And we can have that fatalistic view of life that, well God's sovereign, he's going to bring things about, so why bother praying about it?
[time=1678] But prayer meant that Daniel became active in the process.
[time=1685] Being involved in prayer, Daniel did something different.
[time=1689] Prayer makes us active.
[time=1691] See, Jesus didn't respond himself to with that fatalistic idea when he came across circumstances.
[time=1698] Say, "Well, this circumstance must be the will of the Father.
[time=1702] Far be it for me to do anything about it." When he approached someone that was demon-possessed, he took action and drove the demons out.
[time=1709] When he came to his temple and saw the money changes in the temple, he didn't say, "Man, what a sad thing." But somehow this fits into the providence of God, so I won't do anything about it.
[time=1718] No.
[time=1719] He says he formed a whip of cords and drove them out of there. Christ took action in the same way prayer allows us to be active in the work of God.
[time=1729] It allows us to participate in the work of God.
[time=1733] I want you to understand something.
[time=1736] God's provision without our participation would result in total meaninglessness of life.
[time=1746] I believe that.
[time=1748] If God provided without our being part of it, without our participating in it, then what would the meaning of life be?
[time=1756] We exist.
[time=1757] We live because we have some function in the accomplishing of God's purpose and plan.
[time=1763] But imagine that that wasn't true.
[time=1765] Imagine that God just decided to do everything without our help.
[time=1768] Imagine that he would just sit us on a chair somewhere and say, "Now, I've made you.
[time=1773] You don't need to worry about working to feed yourself.
[time=1777] I'll provide all that for you.
[time=1778] I'll have the food." In fact, you don't even need to work at feeding yourself.
[time=1782] I know that can be a chore sometime, especially the amount of time you spend feeding yourself.
[time=1786] So tell you what I'm going to do.
[time=1787] I'm just going to put it right there in your stomach.
[time=1789] See, you didn't have to do a thing.
[time=1791] See, I'm providing for you.
[time=1792] Isn't that good?
[time=1793] Oh, and the knowledge, the things I want you to learn, you don't have to suffer the experiences of life.
[time=1797] And you don't have to study to learn those things.
[time=1799] I'll just put it right there in that little brain of yours.
[time=1801] See, you know everything now.
[time=1803] God doesn't work that way.
[time=1805] We are part of the process.
[time=1807] We participate in the things that God wants to bring about.
[time=1810] God uses us that way.
[time=1815] We farm to eat.
[time=1818] We study to learn.
[time=1820] God wants to accomplish things through the ministry of this church.
[time=1823] And he could do it without our help at all.
[time=1826] God chooses to use the gifts of his people, the service of his people to bring those things about.
[time=1832] So it's important that we give our offerings.
[time=1834] It's important that we become involved and use the gifts he's given us to accomplish those things.
[time=1839] God uses us in the process.
[time=1843] We participate in the work of God.
[time=1846] Missions does the same thing.
[time=1848] God could just go out and reveal the message to the world, but he chooses to use us.
[time=1852] He chooses to use humans in the accomplishing of his work.
[time=1856] We see it in Scripture.
[time=1858] When God decided he was going to destroy the earth with flood.
[time=1862] And he was going to protect and save one family.
[time=1865] No, in his family, God could have if he decided, put the family in a little bubble, you know,
[time=1872] suspend them in some sort of animation, freeze them in time until the flood was gone.
[time=1879] The waters were recessed and then popped the bubble and out Noah's family.
[time=1883] But God told Noah, "Build an Ark." And it took time.
[time=1889] And it took work.
[time=1892] Noah was involved in the process of what God was going to do.
[time=1895] In the walls of Jericho coming down.
[time=1898] God accomplished that, and yet he used the participation of his people to bring it about.
[time=1903] And I can't even imagine what the people must have thought when the battle plan was shared with them.
[time=1908] You know, here's what God says.
[time=1910] We're going to march up to that city.
[time=1912] Yes, yes.
[time=1913] And we're going to march around its walls.
[time=1915] Yes, yes.
[time=1916] And we're going to go home.
[time=1918] And we're going to do that for six days.
[time=1920] But then on the seventh day, yes, yes.
[time=1922] On the seventh day, we're going to go and we're going to march around that city now at once.
[time=1925] But we're going to march around it.
[time=1926] Seven times, yes, yes, and then what, and then what.
[time=1928] And then we're going to shout and blow our trumpets.
[time=1931] That's it.
[time=1934] Why would God even ask them to do those things?
[time=1937] God was the one that caused the walls to collapse.
[time=1940] And yet he participated.
[time=1942] His people were involved in the process of what came to be.
[time=1945] And I believe prayer is that same way.
[time=1949] Prayer allows us to participate in the work of God.
[time=1954] It's the means God chooses to bring things about.
[time=1957] Prayer changes us too because prayer benefits us.
[time=1961] Prayer doesn't benefit God, it benefits us.
[time=1964] God doesn't need our prayer, we need to pray to God.
[time=1968] Perhaps you know the little acrostic that we oftentimes use when it comes to prayer.
[time=1975] Acts, the A-C-T-S.
[time=1977] A stands for adoration, C for confession, T for Thanksgiving, S for supplication, or request.
[time=1984] But art doesn't fit as well as S, so we use supplication.
[time=1988] And those are good things to look at to evaluate how balance is our prayer.
[time=1992] Because all of those elements need to be in our prayer life.
[time=1996] And in each of those areas we see that it is we who benefit and not God.
[time=2002] It is we who have needed those things and not God.
[time=2005] Adoration. Does God need our adoration? No.
[time=2010] Earlier this year my wife was doing a project around the home.
[time=2013] She was wall-papering the hallway.
[time=2015] And she spent a lot of time doing this.
[time=2017] She came home one afternoon and was all done.
[time=2021] And as is my weakness I failed to notice that the project was finished.
[time=2026] Well she quickly reminded me and said, "What do you think of the hallway?" So I stepped out and peeked on the corner.
[time=2033] Looks good.
[time=2036] It did, it looked good.
[time=2038] Well, don't you think it really looks different?
[time=2041] Yeah, it looks great.
[time=2043] You know, and I just didn't, I mean she was fishing for compliments.
[time=2048] She wanted that adoration and I have to admit it's the same thing with me.
[time=2053] Many times I go to my wife and say, "Look at this, look what I just did." She's not really excited about it.
[time=2058] But what I wanted her to say, "But that is you did a good job.
[time=2061] That was really something." And I want her to say that.
[time=2064] And we all appreciate that.
[time=2065] But that's not what God is.
[time=2067] God's not up in heaven saying, "Come on, do you see what I did?
[time=2070] Come on, tell me how good I am." See, no.
[time=2073] Come on, I want to hear it.
[time=2074] A little more, a little more.
[time=2075] Now, God appreciates our adoration.
[time=2078] God enjoys our adoration.
[time=2081] God desires our adoration.
[time=2083] But it's not because he needs it to fulfill some sort of ego trip.
[time=2087] God knows that we need to give him adoration.
[time=2090] We need to be the ones who acknowledge that God is who he is.
[time=2094] We benefit from prayer and same in confession.
[time=2096] Does God need us to confess our sin?
[time=2098] God knows my sin.
[time=2099] God knows it better than I do.
[time=2101] He will explain the details to him.
[time=2103] He already knows.
[time=2104] And the Bible also tells me that through Jesus Christ, the guilt of my sin is already taken care of past, present and future.
[time=2111] God doesn't need me to come and confess my sin to him, but I need confession.
[time=2115] I need to go to God and ask forgiveness because I know that it is my disobedience that has put a barrier between me and God that has broken our fellowship.
[time=2125] And I need to go before God and confess.
[time=2128] I need it I do, the same with thanksgiving.
[time=2131] Doesn't need our thanksgiving.
[time=2133] He wants us to be thankful.
[time=2135] He enjoys our thanksgiving.
[time=2136] But he knows we need to express our thanks to him so that we acknowledge that it is from him that all blessings flow and supplication.
[time=2146] We're good at that.
[time=2148] Spend a lot of time in that, but God doesn't need our supplication.
[time=2153] God knows what we need.
[time=2154] He already knows that.
[time=2155] We don't have to tell him.
[time=2157] God, as promised, is going to take care of our needs.
[time=2160] See, God doesn't need that.
[time=2163] But we need to do that and the Bible tells us that we present our request to God because
[time=2170] we need to realize that it is through God that these things come.
[time=2173] Not in our own efforts, not our own abilities, but it is from God.
[time=2176] And we need to acknowledge that it is the God who is provided and we need to ask it of him.
[time=2180] We're the ones that benefit from prayer.
[time=2182] So, yes, prayer changes us.
[time=2184] It makes us active in the process of God's work and it benefits us in these different areas.
[time=2190] Now, Daniel was involved in these processes of prayer.
[time=2193] Daniel started out with Adoration, O Lord, the great and awesome God.
[time=2196] And throughout his prayer, he acknowledges that God is great and God is righteous.
[time=2201] Daniel was involved in confession.
[time=2203] And we see a lot of confession.
[time=2204] It's interesting.
[time=2205] Daniel doesn't say, "God, your people have been real crummy."
[time=2211] Daniel says, "We have sinned." He includes himself, his own sin in there.
[time=2216] Daniel confesses.
[time=2218] Daniel also gave supplication and requests at the end of his prayer.
[time=2221] And it wasn't for the benefit of God.
[time=2223] It was for the benefit of Daniel and the people of Israel.
[time=2226] So, yes, prayer changes us.
[time=2229] Maybe a harder question to answer is prayer change events.
[time=2232] Does prayer change events?
[time=2236] And again, I think the answer is yes.
[time=2240] Because prayer is the means by which God accomplishes his sovereign plan.
[time=2257] God in his sovereignty has decided that he will only do certain things in response to
[time=2264] the obedient prayers of his people.
[time=2267] One thing's happened only when prayer takes place.
[time=2271] Daniel's prayer accomplished some things.
[time=2273] One of the things we see immediately when Gabriel comes to him, verse 22,
[time=2279] he says, "I have now come to give you insight and understanding.
[time=2282] As soon as you began to pray, an answer was given, which I have come to tell you." And the inference is there.
[time=2288] The answer was not given until Daniel began to pray.
[time=2292] Prayer causes things to happen.
[time=2294] Now, maybe we can illustrate it in a way that will help us understand a little bit.
[time=2299] Well, let's imagine that we take a match.
[time=2303] And let's imagine that we take this match and we walk into a forest somewhere.
[time=2308] And we strike the match against the bark of a tree and it lights, and we drop it into the dried leaves that are scattered along the ground of that forest.
[time=2318] And we leave the lit match to burn and we walk away.
[time=2322] And the fire builds, the fire grows, and the forest soon ablaze.
[time=2326] Now, there are a number of things that we might be able to look at that illustration, and we might be able to conclude.
[time=2333] A number of observations we could make.
[time=2334] Let me make three observations.
[time=2336] First of all, we know that it was the fire, that was the match, that was the means that caused the forest ablaze, that caused the forest fire.
[time=2347] The match resulted in a forest fire.
[time=2349] We also might conclude that if the match had not been dropped, if the lit match had not been dropped, then the forest probably would not have caught fire.
[time=2358] And we might also observe it, we looked at other forests around the world, that not all forest fires are caused by lit matches.
[time=2367] Some are caused by lightning, some are caused by discarded cigarette butts, some are caused by spontaneous combustion, many other things can cause a forest fire.
[time=2376] Now, prayer in many ways is like the lit match.
[time=2381] We know that prayer does accomplish things.
[time=2388] Like the match had a result of a forest fire.
[time=2393] Prayer is effective in bringing about certain results.
[time=2397] Scripture tells us that prayer is effective.
[time=2400] In Job, chapter 42, God speaks to those friends of Job.
[time=2405] Remember the ones that came and gave them all the "good advice"?
[time=2409] And God says to the friends, He says, "You know, I have not liked.
[time=2414] I have not appreciated your advice.
[time=2416] You have a wrong perspective of who I am.
[time=2419] Here's what you need to do.
[time=2420] You need to go offer sacrifice.
[time=2423] And then you need to ask Job to pray for you, and when Job prays for you, you will be forgiven." See, prayer was the means by which God accomplished something.
[time=2434] And James, it tells us that the prayer of a righteous man is effective.
[time=2441] It's effective.
[time=2442] Prayer has results.
[time=2443] And it goes on to the next verse to give us an example of effective prayer.
[time=2448] It says Elijah was a man just like us.
[time=2450] He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain in the land for three and a half years.
[time=2454] And again, he prayed in the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
[time=2458] The prayers of Elijah had an effect.
[time=2461] First of all, to shut up the clouds, and secondly, the clouds came and gave rain.
[time=2466] But it's important to realize that it wasn't something that Elijah kind of worked up in himself.
[time=2471] Elijah was praying in response to what God had said.
[time=2475] If you go back into the book of 1 Kings, chapter 18, you see that it is God who told Elijah that I am going to cause it to rain now, and then Elijah prayed.
[time=2484] It's also interesting to note that Elijah had to pray a number of times before the rain actually came.
[time=2491] It should be encouragement for us not to give up in our prayers.
[time=2496] Prayer does accomplish things.
[time=2498] But also, in the way that we could conclude that if the match hadn't been lit, most likely the forest would not have been ablaze.
[time=2505] We can also understand that sometimes certain events do not occur simply because there was no prayer.
[time=2517] Certain things do not happen because no one prayed for them to happen.
[time=2523] Again in James, chapter 4, verse 2, James writes, "You do not have because you do not ask God."
[time=2533] And for that if you had asked God, you would have.
[time=2536] But you do not have because you do not ask God.
[time=2539] In the third observation we made that forest fires are caused by other things.
[time=2543] In the same way God accomplishes his purpose and plan.
[time=2545] Through other means besides prayer, he doesn't require our prayer.
[time=2551] He chooses to use our prayer.
[time=2555] In the creation of the world, he didn't require our prayers kind of pushing and prodding him on, helping him along the way.
[time=2562] In the death of Christ and the cross we don't have any understanding that anyone was praying for all that to happen.
[time=2566] God accomplished those things without prayer.
[time=2568] But prayer is a means by which God changes events in his sovereignty.
[time=2572] So yes, prayer does change things.
[time=2577] And we need to be earnest in our prayer.
[time=2579] We need to be faithful in our prayer.
[time=2580] We need to not give up in our prayer because we realize that that is the way God uses to move.
[time=2587] I have one book that is best-seller nowadays, many of you have read this present darkness.
[time=2594] And if any book you want to read that helps give you an understanding or appreciation of prayer, you read this novel, its fiction, and yet it gives us some possible insight into the power and effectiveness of prayer
[time=2606] that God chooses to use prayer to bring about and accomplish his work.
[time=2610] The third question, before we go on, let me just ask one other question.
[time=2615] Prayer does change events.
[time=2618] Can we conclude that all events will be changed when we pray?
[time=2623] No.
[time=2625] Prayer does not change every event.
[time=2628] It does not always change the events of our lives.
[time=2631] There are some reasons for that.
[time=2632] One reason is that Christians pray in conflict with each other.
[time=2636] You know that?
[time=2637] Sometimes Christians are praying for opposite things.
[time=2640] This last spring on Operation Outreach, we were praying that God would give us sunny, clear weather
[time=2646] so that our leaders along with the high schoolers could go on the beaches of Florida and witness.
[time=2652] That's what we were praying for.
[time=2653] But when we got down to Florida, we discovered that the churches down there were praying for rain because Florida was going through a drought.
[time=2658] So sometimes we pray in conflict, so how's God accomplish?
[time=2664] Sometimes things that rule each other out.
[time=2667] But I think even more importantly than that, we need to understand that what we pray for is not always the will of God.
[time=2672] Not every prayer is going to bring about a change of events because it simply isn't God's will.
[time=2677] Now scripture supports that statement.
[time=2680] We see godly people in scripture that pray for things and they do not happen.
[time=2685] Jeremiah chapter 14, God tells Jeremiah don't even pray for the people because I have decided that I am going to judge them.
[time=2696] So don't pray for them.
[time=2697] And we find later that Jeremiah does pray for them anyway, but God still does what he says he was going to do.
[time=2703] Prayer doesn't change him from that course.
[time=2707] Prayer wasn't effective in that regard because it was not the will of God.
[time=2712] When Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 that three times he pleaded with the Lord to take away the thorn of the flesh.
[time=2720] Most people believe that was probably some kind of physical infirmity.
[time=2723] He pleaded with God three different times. Please take this away from me and God said no.
[time=2728] It has a purpose.
[time=2729] And when Jesus Christ, knowing the cross was before him, knelt in the garden and prayed, "Abba Father, everything is possible for you.
[time=2739] Take this cup from me." The God released Jesus Christ from suffering, from the sacrifice.
[time=2750] Prayer does not always change the events.
[time=2754] Scripture gives us evidence of that.
[time=2757] The examples of life give us evidence of that.
[time=2762] Now you know that there are many people today who will tell you that all is required of you is that you have faith
[time=2772] and that God will do it.
[time=2775] If you name it and claim it, God is somehow obligated to perform it because he's promised to do that.
[time=2783] You need to know that's a lie.
[time=2785] That kind of teaching, that kind of theology is wrong.
[time=2790] God nowhere promises that if you just name and claim what you want, God is obligated to do that in some way.
[time=2797] But people teach us all the time.
[time=2799] And we need to be careful that we're not gullible.
[time=2801] You know, you look on TV and you see things that take place and happen.
[time=2805] Whoa, that seems kind of, oh, there must be something to that.
[time=2809] It's reading an article by Dr. C. Everett Coop, who was surgeon general.
[time=2814] Many people believe he is the best surgeon general this country has ever had.
[time=2818] He is also a Christian and committed to believe that God is sovereign and able to do anything he wills.
[time=2825] Yet in his practice as a surgeon and pediatrician, he estimates that he has probably performed about 50,000 operations.
[time=2832] And he said, in his time of working with people who are Christians and non-believers, he said, "You know, I never came across a circumstance where God chose to perform a miraculous healing."
[time=2846] And he says, "I know that many people would come and claim that these things happen and take place, but he says, "Whenever I would investigate and search out, it wasn't the case." "Please don't misunderstand me and don't misunderstand him." We are not saying that God can't do that and doesn't do that, but I do think we need to be careful in the way that we are so flipping about, "Well, you just name it and claim it and God is going to do it." God does not make that promise.
[time=2867] I went to a concert once and the musician began speaking and teaching and eventually healing.
[time=2882] And it was really my first encounter with this kind of thing.
[time=2885] And I remember as he began to teach and to preach and began healing people, it was things like there's someone suffering from a gallbladder problem.
[time=2895] I remember him saying something about someone's big toe that they've been suffering with, "You're healed in the name of Jesus." And he started doing all these healing things and I watched all the time seated in front of the front rows
[time=2907] two guys in wheelchairs and he never said boo to them.
[time=2912] And the more that went on, the angrier I got because I knew Jesus would never have healed in that way.
[time=2920] Throughout all these suggestive things, things that we can't see, but God's healing praised Jesus and yet you avoid the things that are so obvious, the needs that are so apparent, that's not what Jesus did.
[time=2933] There's another doctor by the name of William Nolan who he was not a Christian, but he set out to investigate and try to objectively look at this whole idea of healing.
[time=2944] And he wrote a book entitled "Healing," a doctor in search of a miracle.
[time=2949] And one of the people that he studied was the late Catherine Coleman who was a healer.
[time=2953] And he gave this account of watching one of her healing services.
[time=2962] The service was over, it was done, and he was watching people leave.
[time=2966] He says, "Before going back to talk to Miss Coleman, I spent a few minutes watching the wheelchair patients leave.
[time=2972] All the desperately ill patients who had been in wheelchairs were still in wheelchairs.
[time=2976] In fact, the man with the kidney cancer in his spine and hip, the man who might have helped the auditorium and who had his borrow wheelchair brought to the stage and shown to the audience when he had a claimed cure,
[time=2987] he was now back in his wheelchair.
[time=2990] His cure, even if only a hysterical one, had been extremely short-lived.
[time=2994] As I stood in the corridor watching the hopeless cases leave, seeing the tears of the parents as they push their crippled children to the elevators, I wished Miss Coleman had been with me.
[time=3003] She had complained a couple of times during the service of the responsibility and of how her heart ate for those who weren't cured.
[time=3010] But I wondered how often she had really looked at these people.
[time=3013] I wondered whether she sincerely felt that the joy of those cured of things like bursitis and arthritis
[time=3019] compensated for the anguish of those left with their withered legs, embecilic children, and cancers of the liver.
[time=3029] He just gives us a picture of what we see so many times, contemporary faith teaching today, that it just isn't consistent.
[time=3041] It's not authentic, it's not the way Jesus, when Jesus and the apostles healed, they healed by word, they healed by touch, they healed instantaneously, you didn't have to wait a week or a month or until your faith grew.
[time=3050] They healed completely, and they healed without exception or exclusion of people or disease, in fact even raising from the dead.
[time=3057] And I would suggest to you, if the name and claim that teaching is true, and if God works that way today,
[time=3063] then all these teachers and all these churches that are proclaiming that ought to be shutting down the hospitals, but it isn't happening.
[time=3069] Please don't misunderstand, I'm not trying to belittle God, I'm not trying to lessen the possibilities, I'm not saying that God can't work,
[time=3078] I'm just saying, how does God work today? How does God work today?
[time=3083] Does he promise to work in the same way he did through Christ and the apostles?
[time=3086] Does he promise to work through the same ways that he did through other periods of history when he used miracles to authenticate his message?
[time=3092] A month ago, our seven and a half month old daughter, Aliyah, died of a disease that had been diagnosed fairly soon after she'd been born.
[time=3106] Cornelia the Lang syndrome.
[time=3109] A week after her death I was watching preacher on television, thankfully they're not all this way, but this particular man,
[time=3121] was telling me, if you're a parent with a sick child, don't accept a lie that God wills your child to be sick.
[time=3133] If you have the faith, God will make your child well, God never wills children to be sick.
[time=3139] And I listened to that and I'll admit, when he first said it, I became fearful, I became a little bit guilty.
[time=3145] What if my lack of faith in some way did contribute to the death of my daughter, Aliyah?
[time=3150] But the more I listened and the more I thought, the more I thought back of what God's word teaches the angrier I became at what was being said,
[time=3158] because it is a lie. I want you to know something that I believe God is omnipotent.
[time=3163] God can do anything he chooses to do. Nothing is out of the realm of possibility for God.
[time=3168] I believe God is able to heal anything, even death. God, if he chose, could have reached down to Aliyah's body and changed the genetic structure of her being to make her completely well.
[time=3179] I believe with every ounce of certainty that God could do that.
[time=3185] And I want you to know I prayed that God would do that. I begged God to heal our daughter.
[time=3193] But he didn't.
[time=3197] Now I am I to assume that somehow I lack the proper faith.
[time=3204] I don't believe it was my lack of faith or God's inability, it was his will.
[time=3209] And we must acknowledge the fact that God has worked in certain ways, in certain times, and he accomplishes what he pleases.
[time=3217] And I have confidence that I, as much as I am able, was obedient before God.
[time=3224] And prayed with the trust and belief that God could and was able, and yet God chose not to.
[time=3232] And I still praise him as the providential sovereign good God that he is.
[time=3240] There's a book that I'd recommend some of you might want to read that talks about this. It's fairly new, it's called The Agony of Deceit, published by Moody Press.
[time=3248] And it simply highlights some of these teachings that are coming out today and some of the prominent teachers in our country who are proposing this idea that faith, that prayer will bring about results.
[time=3259] You can name it and claim it. And it's a lie.
[time=3262] Because that view of faith is wrong. That view of faith says somehow I've got to work it up in myself.
[time=3267] Somehow I've got to believe enough, and if I believe enough and I claim it, God will bring it to the past.
[time=3271] But when we understand what real faith is, we realize that real faith is our obedient response to God despite the circumstances.
[time=3278] See, real faith doesn't initiate, and us real faith initiates with God.
[time=3282] Is God doing something first? And we just respond in obedience to what he says or what he does.
[time=3287] It's not something we work up. Faith is our response of trust to God.
[time=3294] It depends on how well I know what God wants and how willing I am to respond obediently to what he wants.
[time=3303] You see, when you look in Hebrews chapter 11, the great faith chapter of the Bible, you don't see men and women of faith who somehow decided something was right to do.
[time=3310] And so they worked up enough faith and went out and do it.
[time=3313] You see people who responded to God's will, what God decreed, what God did, and they responded in obedience to that.
[time=3320] Despite tough circumstances, that's what faith is.
[time=3325] That's what faith is. You say, I know, I know, but people say, you know, I mean, you turn to Scripture and it says, Jesus didn't Jesus say, if you ask anything in my name, I will do it.
[time=3333] If you come to the Father and ask anything in my name, he will give it to you. Didn't Jesus say that?
[time=3338] Yes. But what does that mean? Does that mean if I go to God and say, God, I need a new car and here's the kind I'd like.
[time=3345] In Jesus' name, give it to me. Does God promise that he's going to give it to me then?
[time=3350] The key phrase there is in Jesus' name. What does that mean?
[time=3354] Jesus made the promise if we pray in His name, the prayer will be answered.
[time=3358] But understanding what in His name means then is very important. And His name means that we come, first of all, with the authority of Jesus Christ when we pray to God.
[time=3365] It's not by our own right, it's by the right of Jesus Christ.
[time=3368] But secondly, I believe in His name means that we pray with an attitude of obedience to God.
[time=3374] In that same passage in John 14 through 16, it says, if you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it will be done for you.
[time=3381] That's what I think it means to pray in Jesus' name. It means that we pray when we come before God, we are coming to God like Christ would come to God.
[time=3388] We come in the name of Jesus Christ and the things that we are asking of Him because we are abiding and living Him are the very things that Christ would ask for.
[time=3396] And you see this ties in with what John writes in 1 John when he says that if you ask according to His will, He hears us.
[time=3407] Don't you let anybody tell you that whatever you ask for, if you just name and claim it in the name of Jesus, God is obligated to give it to you.
[time=3413] He is only obligated if it is His will to do it.
[time=3417] So then our obligation is to know the will of God.
[time=3420] Daniel knew the will of God when he approached him.
[time=3423] Daniel knew that God had decreed this, and Daniel went to God in prayer and said, "God, bring it about."
[time=3434] Isn't it great to know that we are used in the providence of God our prayers are used to accomplish His ends?
[time=3444] It's our obligation to be obedient to God, to trust God, and to fervently pray so that God's means that God's result will come through the prayer of His righteous and obedient people.
[time=3459] That's what God desires of us.
[time=3461] Prayer does change things.
[time=3474] If as a result of hearing this message this morning from Pastor Tim Teder, you have decided that you would like to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd encourage you please just to join with me and pray this simple prayer.
[time=3495] Father in heaven we bow before you and believe that you are our God and our Creator.
[time=3502] God, we believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins just as your word says that He did.
[time=3509] Right now Lord, we ask you please to come into our heart, save us from our sins.
[time=3516] We admit to you that we're a sinner and we need salvation.
[time=3521] We ask you please, Lord, to save us. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3528] If you prayed that prayer, we have a booklet that we'd like to send to you.
[time=3533] Please write to us and we'll send you a booklet on Lessons on Assurance, Growing in Christ.
