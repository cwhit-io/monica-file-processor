[time=0] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=56] Welcome to an hour of Bible study music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=59] Thank you for joining us.
[time=61] Our special guest today is Phil Nash, a Christian dramatist from Salem, Oregon.
[time=67] Phil's presentation this morning changed by love is a powerful performance of the lives of four eyewitnesses who heard and touched Jesus and whose hearts were changed as he touched them with his love.
[time=79] It offers a fresh and exciting spark of imaginative chipped truth to a very timeless and significant moment in biblical history.
[time=87] [MUSIC]
[time=89] Special music today includes two solos from Brian Losen and a solo from Allison Heckerman.
[time=97] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled "Great is Thy Faithfulness."
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=111] "Great is Thy Faithfulness, O God My Father."
[time=121] There is no shadow of turning with thee.
[time=131] [MUSIC - 178 seconds]
[time=333] Wonderful grace of Jesus. Him number 198, just clear your throats a little bit
[time=339] and take a deep breath. This is a powerful piece. Again speaking of the wonderful faith that the Lord Jesus Christ has and the grace that He's given us.
[time=347] 198 will sing the first verse in chorus together.
[time=351] [MUSIC - 68 seconds]
[time=431] Amen. Thank you for your good singing. We continue in music now as Brian Losen comes to minister to us.
[time=437] Just before we sing he sings we praise the Lord for in addition. Olivia Spence was born last week to the Losen family to Kim and Brian and we're just grateful for that new life in their family.
[time=449] Brian comes now to minister to us. Let's listen as he thanks the Lord for his school teachers his Sunday school teachers and workers and all of you that have been a part of teaching children this song is for you.
[time=463] [MUSIC]
[time=487] When I went to heaven you were there with me. Walked upon the streets of gold beside the crystal sea.
[time=502] Heard the angel singing. Someone called your name. He turned and saw this young man and he was smiling as he came.
[time=518] And he said friend you may not know me now but then he said but wait. You used to teach my Sunday school when I was only eight.
[time=536] Every week you would say a prayer before the class was done. One day when you said that prayer I asked Jesus in my heart.
[time=553] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am alive and was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=578] I am so glad you came. Then another man stood before you. Said remember the time a missionary came to your church and his pictures made you cry.
[time=601] You didn't have much money but you gave it anyway. Jesus took the gift you gave and that's why I am here today.
[time=619] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am alive and was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=644] I am so glad you came. One by one they came far as the eye could see. Each life is somehow touched by your generosity.
[time=667] Little things you had said and done to sacrifice is made unnoticed on the earth. In heaven now broke away.
[time=684] And I know up in heaven you're not supposed to cry. But I am almost sure there were tears in your eyes as Jesus took your hand and you stood before the Lord.
[time=708] He said my child look around you. Great is your reward. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=727] I am alive and was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am so glad you came.
[time=750] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am alive and was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=775] I am so glad you came.
[time=809] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. We're glad that you've tuned in.
[time=814] We have a number of special concerts that take place at the Black Hawk Baptist Church that you're not able to see on the Bible Hour, but from time to time we like to remind you that these events take place.
[time=825] One of those events is on August 12th at 6 p.m. We're going to have the King's Brass here. This is a number of Christian musicians who teach in various universities around the Midwest.
[time=838] They get together for the summer and they tour from New York to Florida and in the Midwest around the Indiana area.
[time=846] Again, they're going to be with us at 6 p.m. on August 12th. Some of the finest brass music that you'll ever hear.
[time=853] I hope that as you're watching today and you're able to get out away from your home that you'll set that day to side and join with us.
[time=861] And then as we have special speakers from time to time on the Bible Hour, I want us to look ahead to August 19th.
[time=868] On that day we will have Mr. Jim Rickard. He'll be speaking on financial matters.
[time=874] This man has been a consultant for Christian businessmen around the country and is now living in the Midwest having formerly lived in the California area.
[time=883] Jim is a good friend of mine and has great insight on financial matters.
[time=888] If you're needing help and in your budget, join with us on August 19th. We look forward to that time.
[time=895] For a number of weeks now, we've been telling you that we'll have a special guest today.
[time=899] His name is Phil Nash and Phil is in the studio with me today. Good morning, Phil.
[time=903] Good morning, Pete.
[time=904] It's a delight to have you again. We've had some good fellowship on the West Coast when I taught Western Baptist College.
[time=911] You were in that city and helped me. I remember in particular the Centurion that we did around the Easter season.
[time=918] That was a very delightful presentation.
[time=920] Yes, it was. Good memory.
[time=922] You did all of the drama for that and just got us excited about the prospects of combining drama and music together.
[time=930] Phil, you're in that area. You've been in the Christian drama area for a number of years. What inspired you to get involved in that?
[time=937] Well, I was a teacher for about ten years in the public school system, Pete, in Southern California.
[time=942] And after having gone through a renewal experience in my life with the Lord, I began to ask him about Christian drama.
[time=952] I didn't know what that meant. How might I love him back and share the truth that I believed in with other people somehow?
[time=963] I knew my gift wasn't in being a director of music ministry somewhere or in pastoring.
[time=969] But my training had been in drama, so I began to pray specifically about that.
[time=974] And as I did, he began to reveal a number of things, I think, that led me in the direction of experiencing some drama firsthand in the Christian world.
[time=986] Now, how are you helping churches such as ours to get inspired and incorporate drama in their worship services?
[time=994] Well, I hope that as people experience this play that I will do, one-man presentation, that they will, by the spirit carrying the message, begin to have things that are truthful things come alive in their lives.
[time=1013] They will know the Lord in a more real way than they ever have before.
[time=1017] Well, that's really exciting. We look forward to your ministry in just a few minutes.
[time=1021] Good.
[time=1022] You're here for the Bible hour, of course. We invited you, but you're also in this area for other specific events. Could you tell us about that?
[time=1029] Sure. I have an opportunity to be at a convention in Chicago that will be the Association for Theater in Higher Education.
[time=1038] And this year, for the first time, they're allowing a Christian drama presentation, a religious drama presentation.
[time=1044] And they have asked me to be one of the two presenters that will be there, and I'm excited about that.
[time=1049] Phil, you will be a very fine representation in that conference, and I'm glad that you have that opportunity to represent Christ.
[time=1057] I know you've been excited about your ministry in this area.
[time=1060] And in just a few minutes, you will hear the drama presented, "Changed by Love." And it could change your life.
[time=1067] I hope that you'll stay tuned and listen for this.
[time=1071] We have the opportunity now, this month, to offer to you a book entitled, "Living Beyond the Level of Mediocrity, A Commitment to Excellence."
[time=1080] When Rick Hawk was on the program, he often said that his favorite author, and I agree with him, is Chuck Swindall.
[time=1087] Chuck Swindall wrote this book just a few years ago, and it really is a commitment to excellence.
[time=1094] He really challenges people to go beyond their limitation and attain new heights that God had intended them to do.
[time=1101] And I especially like Chuck's writing because he is always really reliable in his insights and principles,
[time=1109] and he incorporates them right along with the bestseller in all the world, "The Bible." So if you're looking for encouragement today, I want to guarantee you that in this book, Chuck Swindall gives massive doses of encouragement.
[time=1123] If you'd like to receive this booklet, absolutely free of charge, you can write today to the Bible Hour,
[time=1129] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1137] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1146] We are very thankful and through the courtesy of Word Publishing Company to have the opportunity to offer this booklet,
[time=1154] "Living Beyond the Level of Mediocrity," or if you just asked for Chuck Swindall's book, we'll send it to you immediately.
[time=1161] I hope that you'll write us and tell us that you're watching the Bible Hour. It's a great encouragement when you write.
[time=1167] We're going to go back to our regular service now and we look forward to the ministry of music that we have, and then the drama by Phil Nash changed by love.
[time=1177] And it's fun to do that, prepare for a use for children and for adults alike to use those rooms for school
[time=1183] and for Sunday school, for adult Bible fellowships, so that's fun.
[time=1187] We also need to be realistic. And for those of us that are really aggressively in favor of building a building
[time=1193] because we want those rooms for our children and for adults, we need to make sure that we temper our thinking
[time=1199] with the fact that this may not be God's timing.
[time=1202] For people like me who are super aggressive about this, want it for a lot of reasons, we need to pray that God will just in His timing give us peace about when we should build the building.
[time=1212] Hopefully it could be this fall. I still believe it can. For others who are skeptical about that and think, boy, this is just a bad time for us to do that, we'd pray that along with the people that are aggressive,
[time=1223] they would pray for God's timing. And that if it is God's timing, they'll have the peace that comes from God.
[time=1228] His wisdom would come into their heart and they'd have peace about that. Let's pray together about it.
[time=1233] Let's develop a real spirit of unity. God has given us peace.
[time=1237] And we need to make sure that those of us that are aggressive and reticent come together in the Lord Jesus in His timing.
[time=1244] That's all we want. We want to build it when He wants us to build it.
[time=1247] And we're in the process of doing that now. Hopefully we'll be able to do it.
[time=1250] Dick Kelly's going to come. Ushers, if you would come forward, we're ready to take our offering.
[time=1254] Dick is going to lead us in prayer. He's a great elder in our church, been serving here diligently since I've been here and thankful for Dick.
[time=1261] Let's pray together. Father, we've come together today in the spirit of unity to worship You,
[time=1271] to lift up our praise, to lift up our thanksgiving, to lift up our needs.
[time=1277] And Father, even as we worship You now with our tithes and our offerings, we do it in an act of worship to You.
[time=1286] Father, thank You for giving to us that we can give back to You. Father, thank You for taking these gifts and multiplying them in their use here and around the world.
[time=1299] Father, bless both gift and giver even this day as You multiply its use.
[time=1305] Thank You Father for the privilege we have in giving to You in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1335] Age to age, You're still the same by the power of the name.
[time=1343] El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Kukonah, I don't know.
[time=1351] We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai.
[time=1358] Through Your love and through the realm, You save the Son of Abraham.
[time=1367] Through the power of Your hand, You turn the sea into dry land, to the outcast on her knees.
[time=1379] Through the God who He sees, By Your might, You set Your children free.
[time=1390] El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Kukonah, I don't know.
[time=1398] Age to age, You're still the same by the power of the name.
[time=1406] El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Kukonah, I don't know.
[time=1414] We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai.
[time=1428] Through the years You've made it clear that the time of Christ is near.
[time=1445] Though the people couldn't see what Messiah ought to be.
[time=1452] Though You would contain the plan, They just could not understand.
[time=1461] Your most awesome hope is done, Through the free tea of Your Son.
[time=1471] El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Kukonah, I don't know.
[time=1479] Age to age, You're still the same by the power of the name.
[time=1487] El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Kukonah, I don't know.
[time=1494] I will praise You till I die, El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Kukonah, I don't know.
[time=1509] Age to age, You're still the same by the power of the name.
[time=1517] El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Kukonah, I don't know.
[time=1525] I will praise You till I die, El Shaddai.
[time=1547] Thank you, Allison.
[time=1558] We are indeed blessed with talent and ministry-oriented people who sing praises to the Lord and we're grateful for our music today.
[time=1566] I have the privilege of introducing to you Mr. Phil Nash of Dramatic Word from Salem, Oregon.
[time=1571] I became a good friend of mine as I taught out there and I just appreciate the unique way in which he presents the gospel through drama.
[time=1579] We're privileged to have him here this morning and he'll be here again this evening.
[time=1584] Let's welcome Phil Nash as he comes to our platform right now.
[time=1595] Thank you, Pete. Thank you very much. Good morning to you. Good morning to you. Yes, you know.
[time=1602] Nice to see you this morning. I'm glad to be back with you at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1606] It's been about four years since I was here last and remember with me, if you will, as I shared with an earlier service.
[time=1616] The time when I was here last time, I did a character in which I just began performing as I walked down the aisle.
[time=1625] And there were some gentlemen in the back who weren't quite sure that I should walk down the aisle looking something like this and talking as loud as I was.
[time=1636] And I remember one of the gentlemen asking me if he might help me with something. And they looked at me rather strangely as I walked down the aisle and began the character.
[time=1647] It was a fun remembrance that Pete and Carol and I shared yesterday as I came into town.
[time=1654] It's great to be with you again. Now you've ordered up this rain for me since I'm from Oregon so that I'll feel a little bit like home.
[time=1664] Thanks very much. I understand that it's been very sunshiney and beautiful here.
[time=1668] Somehow that's always the way it is when I visit somewhere.
[time=1671] Yesterday it was. It's nice to be here. I know that it's beautiful.
[time=1675] I've forgotten what beautiful country it is around here and all this corn. I love it.
[time=1680] As a matter of fact, Pete and Carol said that we're going to have some sweet corn today or tomorrow, right Pete? Good.
[time=1687] I would like to share with you this morning three characters who found themselves with Jesus Christ at a time very crucial in his life and ours.
[time=1701] It was called The Last Supper Time.
[time=1704] When I first began this piece, I wondered how I might be able to perform more than one character at a time and know what they were like.
[time=1716] Since we know very little about them, the first presentation that I did when I began the ministry was called Come Before Winter, the Apostle Paul in the prison dungeon.
[time=1727] I spent much time talking to the Lord about that and then I did the Apostle Paul and I thought, well that's okay now.
[time=1735] Then it came time for me to do a presentation called Changed by Love, this one that I will share with you this morning.
[time=1742] There were multiple characters and we know very little about them, we know most about the Apostle John, the one called the Beloved One.
[time=1751] So I said to the Lord, Lord now, you're the only one who lived back then and knew them and who lives now and knows me.
[time=1759] I wonder if there's something that I might know that would help me with this.
[time=1765] Well I was impacted with the story, remember with me this story, God's selection of the Second King of Israel.
[time=1773] Samuel the prophet who anointed the first king Saul is to anoint the second king because as we remember Saul, even though early on in his kingship, things went well, soon went awry.
[time=1791] And it was time to anoint the second king.
[time=1794] So Samuel who is the mouthpiece for God comes to Jesse who is the father and he knows that from Jesse's sons he is to anoint the next king of Israel, that's the message he has received.
[time=1811] And so he stands before the oldest, Eleab was his name and Samuel looked at Eleab and the Bible tells us that Samuel thought to himself, surely I'm standing before the one God's going to choose.
[time=1831] I know that.
[time=1833] Do any of you remember King Eleab?
[time=1836] No.
[time=1837] If you remember King Eleab because there wasn't any.
[time=1840] And so David was the man who was to be chosen, we remember because he was the second king.
[time=1849] But Samuel hadn't come to David and Samuel realized by the selection that God told him that Eleab was not the one.
[time=1863] And so Samuel said, oh, I would like to say the next one please.
[time=1868] And the next one and the next one and the next one and all seven.
[time=1874] And God said no to all of them.
[time=1877] Had I been Samuel the prophet, I think that I would have thought then that I had made another terrible mistake.
[time=1885] And I might have shot those arrow prayers that we shoot to God to say, oh, God, have I gotten the wrong place, the wrong time, the wrong people.
[time=1895] And when Samuel the prophet said to Jesse the father, don't you have any other sons?
[time=1901] Had I been Jesse the father, I think I would have thought, what's wrong with these guys?
[time=1905] Here we have some fine, good looking leadership potential men.
[time=1909] What's wrong?
[time=1910] But Samuel said, don't you have any other sons and Jesse the father said, well, well, sure, I have just a kid.
[time=1920] We have a kid, but he's out in the pasture.
[time=1923] Samuel said, bring him in.
[time=1925] We won't sit down until we've seen him and then walks the kid.
[time=1930] Of course, David was his name.
[time=1932] We do remember King David and we remember that he was called a man after God's own heart.
[time=1939] Now, that would be exciting to be called a man after God's own heart, a person after God's own heart.
[time=1945] That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?
[time=1947] Well, that was David.
[time=1949] But we know the story.
[time=1951] We know that things, well, they didn't go so smoothly for David.
[time=1955] He made lots of mistakes in his life, just like you and I make lots of mistakes in our lives.
[time=1962] But he had a heart, it was after God's heart, a heart that was willing to change.
[time=1969] He wanted to know God and he wanted to live where God lived.
[time=1975] As a matter of fact, David wrote, oh God, how do we live where you live?
[time=1984] How do we live in your tent, David said?
[time=1987] Ah, yes, I know.
[time=1990] He who walks with a pure heart, with truth, he lives where you live.
[time=1996] So this morning, as we look at these characters, remember that Jesus, the Christ, God's Son,
[time=2004] would make a selection based upon the same knowledge that his father had, based upon the knowledge of the heart that was willing to change.
[time=2014] And as we look at these characters this morning, we look at them with perhaps imperfections.
[time=2021] Remember, Jesus chose them not because of the physical eyes as Samuel the prophet used
[time=2032] when he stood before Eleab the oldest son and said, surely that's the one?
[time=2037] Because you know, the Bible tells us right at the end of that section why God didn't choose that way because God says, I choose by the heart, not by what you use, the physical eyes.
[time=2051] Remember, as we see these characters this morning, the first character, he's a rather serious character.
[time=2060] We have all had very serious times in our lives and certainly very humorous times.
[time=2065] Perhaps this time for Simon the Zealot is a more serious time.
[time=2074] Reflect with me now through the imagination, the great gift that God has given to us,
[time=2081] and we look at this first character, Simon the Zealot.
[time=2089] The one who earlier in his life had to carry a knife hidden and ready for use.
[time=2095] But when he was attracted to Jesus, he was attracted to a new way of life, a new means of achieving his own goals.
[time=2105] The supper table is ready.
[time=2108] Did you care to join me for supper?
[time=2110] Supper time, we add one word, we say the last supper time, and it changes our meaning and our focus.
[time=2118] Our imagination, memory, rushed together and we see a group of friends, their good friends, glad to be together.
[time=2124] They're in a room upstairs somewhere.
[time=2127] They are here for a specific purpose because most of them have celebrated the Passover meal since they were children.
[time=2134] But somehow the time has changed.
[time=2138] Jesus begins to speak.
[time=2141] He is the potter molding the clay. He has loved these men.
[time=2144] He is loving them. He is changing them. He is making them whole.
[time=2148] And as he reveals mysteries to them, they don't quite understand.
[time=2152] He tells them how much he loves them.
[time=2154] As a matter of fact, it's the Apostle John who remembers for us how much Jesus loved them.
[time=2161] And John said, "Well, he loved us so much he washed our feet."
[time=2170] They didn't quite know how to respond to that.
[time=2173] You see, the servants were the ones who washed the feet after they came in.
[time=2178] That is, after the disciples came in from outside, and Jesus said, "Do the same for each other."
[time=2187] How was that?
[time=2190] And then a short time later, Jesus looked at his friends and he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."
[time=2201] And then he said, "I tell you the truth, I tell you the truth, I tell you the truth, I tell you the truth."
[time=2224] Well, and as Peter rises and proclaims that he will stand by Jesus until the end, the others are good friends too.
[time=2232] They want to say the same thing to Jesus.
[time=2234] Jesus, we will stand by you until the end.
[time=2239] And now, we enter into the life of one of those men who was with Jesus.
[time=2246] One of those men who was reflecting, Simon Zellat, the street fighter, the guerrilla fighter, the freedom fighter for the Jews,
[time=2259] as he reflects to the words of Jesus, "One of you is going to betray me."
[time=2271] But, through Jesus, no, it isn't me, I'm not that one.
[time=2277] Oh, I tell you, I'm the first one the rest of the friends would think, "But it's not me, I wouldn't do that." Oh, there was a time when the words of Jesus, they would have meant nothing to me.
[time=2286] That was a time of killing.
[time=2288] We killed Romans because they were spears stuck in the side of my people.
[time=2293] Pillages lazy hateful, and one of their favorite tricks was to call one of us out to carry the pack for a mile.
[time=2300] It is a law, a Roman law.
[time=2302] They can call it Jew out whoever they want to carry their pack for a mile, but I tell you something.
[time=2307] We turned this little game around on them, though.
[time=2309] At night, we wouldn't station ourselves in the city, and the soldier would be entering by the gate.
[time=2314] He would be hot and tired, not paying much attention.
[time=2317] We would get ourselves noticed.
[time=2319] He would tell us to carry his pack, and we would carry his pack, and we would lead him down the streets back into the alleyways.
[time=2327] Suddenly, there were 14 hands and seven knives, and he was dead.
[time=2333] He was dead, but I tell you, this was no longer a satisfying game of revenge for me.
[time=2338] It was more like a battle, a war.
[time=2340] Every day, every night, I couldn't sleep.
[time=2342] One night, I got up, I was wandering around the city.
[time=2346] There was some noise coming from a house over there.
[time=2350] People were pushing out of the door and the windows.
[time=2353] I went over to see what was going on.
[time=2355] There was a man inside a Jew.
[time=2357] He was talking.
[time=2358] I decided to push my way in and hear what he had to say.
[time=2361] The people, they were asking questions and laughing.
[time=2364] I tell you, I didn't hear anything very funny.
[time=2367] Until one time, one time this man said, if someone forces you to go a mile, go with him two miles.
[time=2375] Two miles, he said.
[time=2378] Then I laughed.
[time=2379] I laughed and went home.
[time=2381] What did that have to do with me?
[time=2383] Loving my enemies?
[time=2385] Being kind to the poor?
[time=2387] I am one of the poor, I thought.
[time=2390] There was no way into that life for me.
[time=2393] The next day, I was coming home from my work in the fields.
[time=2398] I was hot and tired and wanting to rest and get something to drink.
[time=2405] There was a soldier.
[time=2408] Just as I approached the gate, he was coming out of the gate.
[time=2411] I turned away.
[time=2412] I didn't want him to see me, but it was too late.
[time=2414] He saw me, carrying my pack, he said.
[time=2418] I am not even going your direction.
[time=2421] I told him, carrying it, he said, and threw down his pack, started to draw his sword.
[time=2426] I reached for my knife, but I realized there were no other knives, no darkness or alleyways
[time=2433] to help me.
[time=2436] So I leaned over and picked up his pack.
[time=2440] I began to carry his pack down that dirty, dusty road I counted every step I took.
[time=2445] I finished about three quarters of a mile.
[time=2448] All of a sudden, this buzzing in my head, it was the words from the night before.
[time=2455] It was I thinking, I just went ahead.
[time=2460] I finished my mile.
[time=2461] I turned around to give him pack his pack and all of a sudden, that bug stung me.
[time=2466] I heard the words carry the pack for him one more mile, just one more mile.
[time=2474] I didn't know why I did it then.
[time=2477] I just turned and kept walking.
[time=2480] The soldier, he followed, but slowly he was afraid.
[time=2484] He knew we had finished our mile.
[time=2486] "What are you doing?" he asked me.
[time=2488] "I'm carrying your pack a little longer," I told him.
[time=2491] "Why are you doing that?" he demanded.
[time=2494] "Why am I doing that?" "I'm following orders.
[time=2499] I'm following orders," I told him.
[time=2501] "Who's orders?" he demanded.
[time=2502] "Who's orders?
[time=2504] Who's orders?" "A man?
[time=2507] A man?
[time=2508] A teacher?
[time=2509] A teacher?" "Who said we should love our enemies?" "Aah!" he said, "Love us, you all hate us." He was right.
[time=2521] He was right.
[time=2523] I just turned and walked on.
[time=2526] I said nothing.
[time=2530] Finally he stopped.
[time=2531] He looked off into the distance.
[time=2533] I looked at him.
[time=2534] I wondered why he had even come here from Rome.
[time=2536] Why did he hate the Jews so much?
[time=2539] All of a sudden he spoke.
[time=2541] He said, "I miss my family." "Oh!
[time=2544] You miss your family?" "I miss my family too.
[time=2547] They were all killed by Romans," I said.
[time=2550] He turned and looked at me.
[time=2552] In his eyes there was some kind of understanding and compassion.
[time=2559] This was not hate.
[time=2561] And then he said something.
[time=2563] He spoke.
[time=2564] He told me he lost a brother.
[time=2567] He said he and his brother came here from Rome.
[time=2569] They were put on guard duty and the next morning he went to find his brother.
[time=2574] He found them and his throat was cut.
[time=2579] They told him, "Zellitz had done it." "Zellitz had done it." I just turned and walked on quietly.
[time=2589] We walked quietly for a long time and all of a sudden he began to speak to me.
[time=2596] He asked me about this man who said we should go the extra mile.
[time=2601] The one who said we should love our enemies.
[time=2604] He made me tell it all.
[time=2606] Everything I heard from the night before.
[time=2609] I tell you something.
[time=2611] I learned that day that enemies should never talk.
[time=2615] If you want to remain enemies, you might not look at each other with fear and hatred anymore.
[time=2623] After three miles I gave him back his pack.
[time=2627] He walked on.
[time=2629] I have not seen him since that time.
[time=2632] I threw away my knife.
[time=2633] I couldn't fight anymore after that.
[time=2635] I went back to tell this man this Jesus.
[time=2638] What happened to me?
[time=2640] And when I told him, he smiled.
[time=2645] He smiled.
[time=2648] I have not left him since that time.
[time=2652] I stand in the marketplace to talk to the Romans.
[time=2656] My friends, they spit at my feet.
[time=2658] My brother, he won't even talk to me.
[time=2660] I just wanted my people to be free.
[time=2663] I thought that killing would get us freedom.
[time=2666] But inside I was trapped.
[time=2670] I was dying.
[time=2672] And this man Jesus.
[time=2675] He set me free.
[time=2678] I am free.
[time=2681] I would not betray you.
[time=2683] No Lord.
[time=2685] I wouldn't do that.
[time=2688] It's not me.
[time=2691] Is it Lord?
[time=2696] No, it was not Simon the Zealot.
[time=2699] Someone else we remember.
[time=2701] But you see, even though Simon was a man who had certainly been touched and changed by the love of Jesus Christ,
[time=2709] he remembered his own humanity.
[time=2711] He remembered who he had been, what he had been, from that he was saved.
[time=2718] As you and I are saved.
[time=2722] Well, this next character is one I think is a change of pace, perhaps from Simon,
[time=2732] reflecting a different way as you and I often reflect differently to a different stimuli.
[time=2738] And Jesus said those words and this man reacted in a perhaps strange way.
[time=2744] I am afraid away too close to the way that I might react sometimes.
[time=2748] Have you ever looked rather humorously at yourself?
[time=2751] Well, of course you have.
[time=2753] Have you looked humorously at someone else?
[time=2756] Well, unfortunately we have done that too.
[time=2760] This man suffers from what I call the Adam and Eve syndrome.
[time=2764] He is blaming it on someone else.
[time=2767] That couldn't be my fault, must be hers, must be his, must be someone else's.
[time=2773] Bartholomew, also known as Nathaniel, I see him in my imagination, that great gift from God as a teacher,
[time=2782] a scholar of scripture, a man who knew how to debate and yet not be argumentative,
[time=2788] who spoke instructingly, persuasively, self confidently and yet without a self righteousness
[time=2795] that would keep him from hearing his students or his teachers' ideas.
[time=2800] And now rather humorously, may we look at this man whose name is Bartholomew.
[time=2810] What? Betray Jesus.
[time=2815] Betray Jesus.
[time=2817] And one of us, not very likely, take a look at us.
[time=2824] Of course there is Thomas.
[time=2832] He still argues with the Lord late at night about his plans.
[time=2837] But Betray Jesus.
[time=2839] No, it would not be Thomas.
[time=2843] Thomas is the one who said, "Let us follow Jesus to Jerusalem.
[time=2846] We will die in with him." That's what we said.
[time=2848] It's not an easy journey for Thomas.
[time=2851] It is more like clamoring over the rocks or the boulders that get in the way of the mountaintop, but Betray Jesus.
[time=2858] It would be like asking the camel to swim, it would not be Thomas.
[time=2868] James or John, on the other hand.
[time=2873] Either of them, always making issues of the kingdom and power.
[time=2878] Not long ago, John came back as if to present a prize to the master.
[time=2884] You see, John had found a man who was casting out demons in Jesus' name, but he was not one of us.
[time=2890] So John told him to stop that immediately.
[time=2893] And he came to present this to Jesus.
[time=2896] But I tell you, the master slipped right through the trap in that prize and right into John's heart.
[time=2901] So deft, so agile were his words.
[time=2904] He told John to allow others the experience of carrying Messiah's help to those who were sick, to those who were in need.
[time=2911] That has touched my friend John deeply.
[time=2914] He has changed.
[time=2916] It would not be John.
[time=2919] Peter, why would you do that Peter?
[time=2921] What am I saying?
[time=2923] No, it would not be Peter.
[time=2925] No.
[time=2926] Yes, he still argues with Jesus.
[time=2929] All right.
[time=2932] These men would rather cut off a hand than to betray Jesus.
[time=2937] Hm, betray Jesus, Jesus fall into the hands of the Romans.
[time=2943] The Romans would surely kill him.
[time=2946] Kill Jesus?
[time=2948] That would be like trying to kill God himself, eh?
[time=2953] I remember the first time I met Jesus.
[time=2956] I was standing, talking to some of my students after school.
[time=2961] My friend Philip, he was running looking for me and he was yelling, "Batholom you, Bartholom you!" Where are you?
[time=2967] We have found the Messiah.
[time=2969] It is Jesus of Nazareth.
[time=2971] My students and I relapsed about anything good coming out of Nazareth.
[time=2976] You don't.
[time=2977] All of a sudden, Philip spots me and he comes running after me.
[time=2980] All right, all right, Philip.
[time=2981] I'll go with you.
[time=2983] And Philip takes me to see Jesus.
[time=2986] As I approach Jesus, Jesus leans over to Andrew and he says in my direction, "Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile."
[time=2995] Oh, these were the very words spoken to me by the Rabbi Gamaliel.
[time=3000] The Rabbi he is my teacher and like a father to me.
[time=3003] And he had said those very words to me.
[time=3005] Now this man was saying them, "How do you know me, sir?" I asked him.
[time=3010] You, Nathaniel Bartholomew, he said, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
[time=3018] No, you couldn't see me under the fig.
[time=3023] The reason I go there, it is a garden with high walls.
[time=3028] I go there to pray.
[time=3030] So no one can see me, but...
[time=3033] Messiah, you are the Son of God, the King of Israel.
[time=3044] And he laughed, and he said, "Because I saw you under the fig tree, you believe?" Then he said, "We would see greater things than this." He said, "We would see the heavens open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."
[time=3059] Oh, his words, they rang truth in my heart.
[time=3062] I have searched my entire lifetime, a confirmation of the Scripture to find.
[time=3066] And I tell you something, his words were not the end.
[time=3069] We have seen more.
[time=3071] We have seen the lepers cleanse, the blind people seeing, the deaf people hearing, the lame people walking.
[time=3077] We have even seen Jesus walking on the water of Galilee.
[time=3083] My friend Peter walked out to see him there.
[time=3087] For a little while, he walked out there.
[time=3090] The storm, it fell to calm the Jesus' very words.
[time=3097] Just to come into the presence of this man, to talk with him, to eat with him, to touch him, to love him,
[time=3105] and to send him to the dogs to be chewed apart as scraps.
[time=3110] No, he is Messiah.
[time=3114] Who were there to touch him?
[time=3117] Well, no one did dare to touch him.
[time=3126] Then in a moment of betrayal, he was kissed upon the cheek, and we remember there was a riot.
[time=3132] A sudden hatred and fear of people broke loose.
[time=3136] Jesus was carried away in the rabble of men's misery, and there he was left to die on a cross.
[time=3141] And we say, "What about his friends? What about all his friends?" They all left him, John Simon, the noisy Peter, the unshakeable Bartholomew, they all left him to stand on his own.
[time=3155] So human those men so much like us.
[time=3160] And now the last character.
[time=3163] May I share with you someone who at the last supper table was a very young man.
[time=3170] I don't play the young man so well anymore.
[time=3174] As I told those who were in the earlier service, I now need to play the old John, the apostle.
[time=3180] We find him, perhaps 90 years old, perhaps at the end of his life.
[time=3187] We don't know for sure, in a home, his home, in a cave somewhere.
[time=3194] But one thing we do know, he loves to share the story of the time that he was with Jesus the Christ.
[time=3201] He loves to share that story to anyone who will listen into now and hear the words of the apostle John.
[time=3208] The last apostolic witness to the greatest century the world will ever know until Jesus comes again.
[time=3216] There are many more of you than there were yesterday. Come in, come in.
[time=3229] I'm glad to see you. I see you brought your friends.
[time=3233] I love to tell the story. I'm so sorry I went to sleep on you yesterday while I was telling you the story.
[time=3241] I was so tired, but I remember exactly where I was.
[time=3246] Jesus was about to reveal who it was who was going to betray him.
[time=3250] After dipping the bread in the dish, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.
[time=3256] After Judas had taken the bread, Satan entered into him, and Judas went out and it was night.
[time=3264] Jesus looked at us. He said, "I'm going away now as I told the Jew, so I tell you."
[time=3273] Peter said, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus said, "Well, where I am going, I cannot share that now, but I will tell you later a new command I give to you.
[time=3283] I love one another the entire world will know that you are my disciples." Jesus said, "If you have loved one for another." Peter said, "Lord, why can't I go with you now? I will lay down my life for you."
[time=3297] And Jesus looked at him and said, "Will you lay down your life for me, Peter?" I tell you the truth. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
[time=3309] That was very hard news for all of us, and especially for my friend Peter.
[time=3317] Jesus looked at us. He knew our hearts.
[time=3321] Let not your hearts be troubled.
[time=3324] You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house, our many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you.
[time=3331] I am going to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and get you that you might be where I am going.
[time=3338] Thomas said, "Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?" And Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life." No man comes to the Father except by me. If you had known me, you would have known the Father.
[time=3351] From now on, you have known Him and seen Him.
[time=3354] Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father, and we should be satisfied." Jesus said, "Have I been with you so long, Philip, and you have not recognized me?
[time=3361] Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, or else believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves."
[time=3367] I tell you the truth, the things that I have done, greater things will you do because I go to be with the Father.
[time=3374] Ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. The Son might bring glory to the Father, Jesus.
[time=3380] Ask me for anything in my name. I will do it.
[time=3384] I will ask the Father. He will send you another comforter, a counselor, to be with you forever.
[time=3392] The Holy Spirit, He will lead you to all the truth. The prince of this world is coming.
[time=3399] He has no control over me, but the world must know that I love the Father, and I do exactly as He bids me.
[time=3406] Come, let us go. And they went out, and it was night.
[time=3414] We remember they went from the room to the garden to pray.
[time=3419] "Father, if there's another way," Jesus said, "there was no other way." Remember, we stand on this side of the resurrection, this side of the crucifixion,
[time=3428] into the knowledge that Jesus Christ who has risen from the dead, we stand not with dreams crushed, but with the knowledge of the truth.
[time=3435] Let's pray.
[time=3437] Father, thank you for the knowledge of the truth you have given to us for embracing us.
[time=3441] We love you, Lord, in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you, my friends.
