[time=79] Have you ever tried riding a bicycle without moving?
[time=82] It doesn't work.
[time=83] You might stand there for a minute, and then you fall down.
[time=87] Church is much the same way.
[time=88] Church was never meant to be a place of inactivity.
[time=91] To work right, the church is to be a place of action, of momentum.
[time=95] Join us today as we look at the New Testament Church to see how we can be Christians who are active in our believing in Christ and belonging to the church.
[time=105] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.

[time=1858] Father there's coming a day when every leader will have fallen.
[time=1868] When every nation is ended.
[time=1872] And it's coming a time when even our own lives and the control that we try to exercise over them
[time=1878] is gone.
[time=1880] And in that day Jesus Christ will still be Lord of all.
[time=1885] We come together this morning not wanting to wait till that day to bow our knees at acknowledging that he is king of kings but today saying Jesus Christ you are our Lord today.
[time=1899] We ask that you be pleased with what we do and to take your word that also endures forever and to teach it to us so that we can be different.
[time=1909] Pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Savior and our King amen.
[time=1917] We are allowed to peek into an average home on a given evening.
[time=1921] We might see a scene something like this the family is together in a common room and all the other tasks are forgotten as they sit and they watch silently.
[time=1935] Around them are gathered all those things that are necessary for this occasion the drinks chips TV guide and most importantly the remote control.
[time=1945] And they sit there no real activity no real involvement only their observation.
[time=1953] The picture of passivity mother and father on the couch the kids sprawled out on the carpet.
[time=1960] We coined a phrase that describes these people called them couch potatoes or rug spuds.
[time=1968] Now let's look into the typical church and we see that same family sitting there they look a little different now they are dressed much finer. Instead of the chips we see a role of life savers and a mother's purse and instead of TV guide they have their Bible.
[time=1988] We look but we don't see a remote control although halfway through the service they're all wishing they had one but there is there is some similarity because this family still sits without any real activity seems the purpose of this family is not so much to participate as it is to observe and although they've replaced the couch with a pew it's different. We might need to give them a new term and we need to call these people the pew potatoes.
[time=2020] They're more interested in being spectators.
[time=2024] The pew potato lacks involvement.
[time=2028] Minister once commented to a woman in his church as she was leaving how glad he was to see her each week coming and sitting in her spot and listening so attentively to his message. She replied yes such a rest after a hard week's work to come and sit on the soft cushions and not think about anything.
[time=2052] That's the response of a pew potato not wanting to be involved. The pew potato likes to come and enjoy the performance of others the pew potatoes has come entertained me perhaps even inspire me but don't expect me to be too involved in the process of things I've come to take in not to give out too much.
[time=2072] I don't think the church was meant to be an assembly of pew potatoes.
[time=2076] It was never meant to be an organization where 90% of the members come to watch the other 10% perform.
[time=2084] The church shouldn't be a body of spectators but a body of participants. I want to look this morning at the example of the New Testament church to see some things we can learn in protest to the pew potato.
[time=2100] Would you turn to Acts chapter 2?
[time=2104] In Acts chapter 2 we see a new organization. We see the remnant of God's people now spirit filled now indwelled by God's spirit following Pentecost. Peter empowered by the Holy Spirit has just delivered a tremendous message and we want to pick up the narration as Peter finishes his sermon.
[time=2128] Acts chapter 2 beginning with verse 37 When the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter in the other apostles, "Brothers what shall we do?" Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2152] The promise is for you and your children and for those who are far off for all whom the Lord our God will call." With many other words he warned them and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation." Those who accepted his message were baptized and about 3,000 were added to their number that day.
[time=2172] They devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.
[time=2184] They were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need.
[time=2192] Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.
[time=2196] They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people and the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
[time=2210] I see in this example of those New Testament Christians, not an example of passivity but an example of action. The people were involved.
[time=2222] And I see in this passage they were involved in two primary ways.
[time=2226] They were active in their believing and they were active in their belonging. We see that they were active in their believing because this passage shows us that these were people that questioned openly. They accepted totally. They baptized publicly and they joined quickly. When they heard the message of Peter, they didn't just keep it to themselves and wonder quietly about it, but they asked out loud. They asked tell us what are we to do? And when the message was explained to them that they were to trust in Christ who is Savior and Lord, that they were to save themselves out of a corrupt generation and instead be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, they accepted that message.
[time=2274] They accepted it totally. Their acceptance of Jesus Christ was a radical acceptance. It meant for them a change of life and they were baptized publicly.
[time=2286] The conversion of these Christians was not a private matter. Too often today we hear that religion is a private affair. What someone's relationship with God, whoever, whatever that is to them is a private matter. But for these people it was a public matter and they gave themselves to baptism publicly so that people would know that they were committing themselves to following Jesus Christ.
[time=2314] To those Jews, this baptism was not easily done.
[time=2318] It was an act of humility because the Jews weren't usually baptized.
[time=2322] They were Gentiles who would be baptized to become Jews. But now the Jews were being baptized to show their loyalty to a new covenant.
[time=2330] And baptism for many of them meant they'd be ostracized. They'd be pushed out away from their families.
[time=2338] But they were baptized publicly, active belief.
[time=2342] And they joined quickly. It says that on that day 3,000 were added to their number.
[time=2350] 3,000. In one day church membership grew from 120 to 3,120. Now it is a little different.
[time=2358] Their only choice was the one church there in Jerusalem. They didn't have an option of picking, which might be the best in the community. But can you imagine the growth in one day? The percentage of growth 2,600 percent growth in one day. And the interesting thing is they didn't wait.
[time=2378] They were added that day. They joined themselves to be identified with God's people. For these people, their belief was active. We've chosen today the theme "Blackhawk, A Place to Belong." You may be a member of another church. You may be watching on television in 10 another assembly of believers. So you may put another church name in there. But the important thing is that your church should be a place to belong.
[time=2406] These New Testament Christians, in their belonging, were active.
[time=2410] When we look at this passage, we see that they were devoted, it says. It says they devoted themselves in verse 42. They gave themselves. They committed themselves.
[time=2422] And in this passage, we see that they were devoted to learning. They're devoted to fellowship, to worship, to giving, to evangelism, even to service. They're devoted to learning.
[time=2434] It's interesting to me that when you look in verse 42, it says they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching. That's the first description of the activity of this New Testament church. And it's interesting to me that as I read the account of what they did together, it seems that the learning was the priority. The church came together to learn more than to experience. Now experience is important in the life of the church. We come together to feel, to experience, to share in the emotion and the feeling of what happens. But it is more important what we know than what we feel. We ought to be guided by what we learn from God's Word than how we feel about being together, how we feel in our Christian lives. I don't know about you, but some mornings I wake up and I don't feel like a Christian. But when we come together as the body, it should be our priority to learn what God wants to teach us. And the experience comes secondary.
[time=2494] They devoted themselves to learning. And they were active in their learning.
[time=2498] Real learning takes activity. You don't come and learn just by sitting somewhere and listening to sound waves beat against your ear drum. I tried that in history class.
[time=2506] I got a D. I didn't enjoy history too much. I'd sit in class and the teacher would talk and I heard the words, but somehow they floated across this mass and my head dribbled out the other ear and it never really caught on.
[time=2518] Too often we can do that even in church. We come and we listen to the words. We hear them, but we are not really active in learning.
[time=2526] And we need to be like those Christians who are active and wanting to learn what God would teach them.
[time=2534] They're devoted to fellowship. It says that they met every day, verse 36, or 46, excuse me, every day they continue to meet together in the temple course. Devoted to fellowship, they met regularly. Regular attendance to these believers was a little different than the way we describe regular attendance today.
[time=2554] Today it might be said like the person who commented, "Yes, I attend church regularly. Every Easter, never miss one." To these people, regular attendance meant that they desired to be together in fellowship every day and that continued and continued for some time.
[time=2570] They fellowshiped together. It was consistent and they enjoyed it.
[time=2574] They liked doing it.
[time=2578] I know a man from another church who recently was in the worship service of that church and the worship director asked the people if they would stand and just welcome each other in fellowship that morning. And he encouraged them to do this.
[time=2594] He said, "Turn to those believers around you and just tell them that you love them." Well that was a little awkward, but for this man it was a little too much for anybody to tell him to love him, but that he had to tell someone that he loved them and he ended up leaving the church walking out and that coming back.
[time=2610] Do we enjoy fellowship?
[time=2614] Do we really look forward to being together? Do we love each other?
[time=2618] Or is our fellowship limited to the time we give in a service occasionally to turn and greet those around us? It ought to be more than that. They devoted themselves to fellowship. They devoted themselves to worship.
[time=2630] And as we look at these Christians we see that they worshiped in the temple courts. The temple was the formal place for Jewish worship. And when these Jews came to Christ and committed themselves to being his disciple, they didn't give that up. They continued to meet in the courts. There was a new perspective about their meeting, but they continued that formal way of worship. But it also says that they met in each other's homes. There was that informality about it as well.
[time=2658] But they continued to meet together to worship God.
[time=2662] It teaches us, and we ought to know this, that there is no set time. There is no set place. There is no particular style of worship that is the right kind of worship. Different churches worship in different ways. And usually what it comes down to is a matter of preference. I enjoy this. I see this as worship because that's what I prefer. In the choir saying this morning, right now is the right. You maybe saw my foot tapping and my hand was back there moving inside. I was dancing. I enjoyed that.
[time=2694] I could take that every Sunday morning. And when Keith sang in a more contemplative, strong way about the love of God, that has a different response. But you know what? They're both worshiped. We can worship the important thing is that we focus on God. That's what worship is.
[time=2710] Focusing on God. And we need to come together like those Christians with intent of focusing attention on God. Many times in our churches have lost that kind of focus. Chuck Swindall made the comment that we are often so caught up in our activities that we, now listen to this, we tend to worship our work. We work at our play, and we play at our worship.
[time=2734] You don't take worship seriously enough. A.W.
[time=2738] Tozier who has written a lot of profound things in their area of our commitment to God and our knowing Him and our worshiping Him had the stinging remark to say about contemporary worship. He said we have lost the art of worship. We're not producing saints. Our models are successful businessmen, celebrated athletes, theatrical personalities.
[time=2758] We carry on our religious activities after the methods of modern advertisers. Christianity is a little more than objective truths, sweetened with song and made palatable through religious entertainment. Christ calls men to carry the cross, but we call them to have fun in His name.
[time=2774] But there's nothing wrong with excellent music.
[time=2778] There's nothing wrong with enjoying our time of worship, but I'll tell you if all it is is entertainment to us, we're missing the mark.
[time=2786] Worship with these Christians was an activity where they were involved in focusing on God. They're devoted to giving.
[time=2794] I don't know about you, but when I read verses 44 and 45 it can be a little threatening to me. All the believers were together and had everything in common, selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need. See some things in that passage.
[time=2810] See that everyone gave.
[time=2814] Everyone gave. To some degree everyone was giving.
[time=2818] They didn't need the gimmicks to try to inspire people to give that we so often see today. I don't know if you're on any mailing list for churches that do this kind of thing, but I occasionally get some of these gimmicks through the mail. Let me just show you one that I've kept. I have a number of these on file, but this one came in the mail with two pieces of red yarn stuck inside, and the message of this letter is this.
[time=2842] There is a blessed red string which I've cut in half in this envelope.
[time=2846] Tie each half into a knot, any kind of knot. You hide one half of this string on you somewhere until you get the powerful good luck package from me. Rush the other half back to me today, and here's the clincher, but not later than 4.39 p.m. tomorrow with a faith donation for the ministry. Hide the other piece of the string on your body until you get the powerful good luck package.
[time=2870] I was looking for the Ginsu knives that might be offered later.
[time=2874] gimmicks because today many times were even tempted to resort to tactics because we don't seem quite as willing. Everyone here seemed to be willing to be involved in the process of the giving. They were devoted to giving, and they gave everything.
[time=2894] They gave everything. We need to understand this passage. If we get the perception that the giving was mandatory, everybody had to come, and they kind of brought everything they owned and put it in a big pile, and then everyone just took out until it was all equally distributed.
[time=2910] You got the wrong picture. When you look in verse 45, the two verbs mentioned there that they were selling their possessions. They gave to anyone the tense of those verbs seemed to indicate that this process was something that continued to happen as needs arose.
[time=2926] The important thing was the people of this church had the attitude that what I have doesn't belong to me. It belongs to God.
[time=2934] And as others have need, I'm willing to take what I have and to use it to meet those needs.
[time=2942] They were devoted in their giving.
[time=2946] In contrast to the kind of giving that so often we see today, and this can be said truthfully today that so many times when it comes to giving some people stop at nothing.
[time=2958] That's where they stop. Nothing. Well these early Christians were devoted to giving. They were also devoted to evangelism. In the last verse of that passage says the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. These Christians didn't huddle in walls of a church and say let's keep this newfound faith to ourself. They continued to affect the world with the message of Jesus Christ.
[time=2982] And when I looked at their evangelism, I see some things to be true.
[time=2986] I see that the result of evangelism here was not their responsibility but God. And that's true today. It's not my responsibility to go out and save souls.
[time=2994] My responsibility is to go out and tell the truth of what Jesus Christ has done. And God works in the hearts.
[time=3002] I also see that salvation and belonging to the church went hand in hand. When they were saved they were added and they weren't added without being saved. And that's the intent of the church today.
[time=3014] That when someone becomes a Christian that you join some assembly of believers and be a part of that.
[time=3022] I also see here that evangelism happened daily. It wasn't just delegated to some special occasion but each day they are affecting their world with the message of Christ. Finally we see that these people were devoted to service.
[time=3038] We read on and asked to see this but as the church began to develop as new believers realized their gifts they began to evolve, becoming involved in the service of the church. Later in Acts we see that seven were chosen to oversee food distribution. We see Ananias being sent to minister to Paul a new convert. We see the disciple Tabitha who is described as always doing good and helping the poor. We see God raising up prophets and teachers and the church sending out of missionaries.
[time=3070] And when we come to Acts 15 we see the description of many believers not just the apostles and those early disciples but many others teaching the word of God active in service.
[time=3082] Now what are the challenge to us?
[time=3086] Challenge to us as Christians today is not to be passive but to be active. To be active in our belief.
[time=3094] The admonishment that we give today about being involved in the church
[time=3102] is not meant for everyone here or everyone listening today.
[time=3106] It may be that you're a person who's searching in your life. You just want to understand the truth. Maybe you've been searching for a short time, maybe for a long time.
[time=3114] We're not asking you to come and get involved in the ministry of this church but I am challenging you to do this question openly like these believers did. Ask questions.
[time=3126] Usually at the end of a service we give what we call an invitation.
[time=3130] It's not intended to get people to come forward so we can take them in a back room and get them to sign to join our church and give money to us. It's intended to allow us a time when we can answer the questions you have concerning your relationship with God or your relationship to this church. I would encourage you if you hear this morning with questions to ask questions openly. Perhaps come forward or perhaps set up an appointment with another Christian just to talk about the questions you have. We need to question openly.
[time=3158] We need to accept totally. We need to take seriously the call of Christ to deny ourselves to take up our cross daily. Give up everything to follow Him. We need to be baptized.
[time=3170] That's active belief. We've become so strong in our teaching that baptism isn't what forgives sin.
[time=3178] Baptism isn't what saves that we've kind of delegated to this optional activity somewhere down the road if you're a Christian. But in Scripture it was a place of priority.
[time=3186] It was an active obedience that Christians would order to give testimony to the fact that they had made that commitment to Jesus Christ.
[time=3194] And if you're a Christian who's never been baptized, you need to consider your obedience to Christ in this regard. Maybe you've been a Christian for a short while or a long time.
[time=3202] They've been baptized. Be active in your belief.
[time=3206] Finally, like those Christians we need to join the church.
[time=3210] I know people say, is it really important to join a church to be a Christian? No, you don't. No, you don't.
[time=3218] And you don't have to be in an army, to be a soldier.
[time=3222] And you don't have to be in a band to be a tuba player.
[time=3226] You don't have to be on a team to be a volleyball player.
[time=3230] You don't get too many return serves that way. That's not the way those things are supposed to work. And God's intent as a Christian is that you be part of a body of believers. But our particular challenge this morning is to those of you who are already committed to Jesus Christ. And you're involved in a church somewhere. Our challenge to you today is to not be pew potatoes. It's also not to be church hoppers. You know, some people they go to one church and kind of try it out for a while and they go to another church and try it out for a while and they go somewhere else and it's the process of their whole life. Hopping from one church another, looking for that perfect church. And as one person said, if you ever find the perfect church, you better get out because once you're there it's not perfect anymore.
[time=3274] You need to be involved, whether it's at Black Hawk or whatever church you call home. If you are a Christian you need to be involved actively belonging to that church.
[time=3286] Devote yourself to learning the word. Do you bring the textbook with you when you come to church? Do you learn like the Bereans in Acts 17 where it says that they were of more noble character because they not only listened to what was being taught, but then they went back and examined a scripture to see if it was really true.
[time=3302] That's active learning. Are you involved in other groups in the church where you can learn? This isn't the only place where learning takes place.
[time=3310] We've got the women's home bible studies that are starting up again. We've got our Wednesday night programs that Pastor Jim Pearson coordinates and oversees and all these places and others are places where you can be involved in learning. Devote yourself to fellowship.
[time=3326] Not just formally here, but meeting together with believers in informal ways.
[time=3330] Adult bible study fellowships. The ABS are a place where fellowship takes where it happens. Much more than in a service like this because you get to know people. You get to be accountable to others and they learn your needs. You learn theirs and you develop relationships and you care for one another. You need to be involved in a place where fellowship happens. Be devoted to worship.
[time=3354] I hope you're come prepared for worship when you come to church. I hope you enjoy participating in the singing and whatever it is that we do and focusing attention on God. I hope that when it comes to times of communion that you're excited about that. We ought to be.
[time=3374] Devote yourself to giving. We need to get away from the idea that giving is allowing God to have 10% and I keep the rest of the 90% is my own.
[time=3386] Giving recognizes the fact that everything I have is given to me by God.
[time=3390] I'm a steward. I enjoy the things that he's allowed me to have, the things he's blessed me with, but I always have the attitude of generosity in how I use what I have.
[time=3402] Be active in giving. We appreciate the way that the church that you have been giving to the needs of this church, particularly in the last month.
[time=3410] And you need to continue doing that and also give to the needs of other people. What resources do you have that you can use to help meet the needs of others? Be willing to do that.
[time=3422] Be devoted to evangelism. It doesn't matter how trained you are, how much you have learned, how schooled you are.
[time=3430] If you are a Christian, you can evangelize. All that God wants of you is to tell the truth that you know. And if you're a new Christian, all you know that is Jesus died to save me from sin, tell it to people, and then they can find out the rest in this book.
[time=3446] Be devoted to evangelism. Be devoted.
[time=3450] Be active in belonging.
[time=3454] Be devoted in your service.
[time=3458] Be involved.
[time=3462] Do.
[time=3466] It is not enough that we sit and be passive. God wants us to be active in our service for him.
[time=3474] It's been a delight today to share with you the ministry of our Sanctuary Choir
[time=3494] with soloist Kevin Rowe. Other special music was from Keith Tittagum and celebration. The message today was from our Associate Pastor Tim Tittter. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to bow and pray this prayer with you. Our Father, we thank you that we can come to you and we can share the needs that we have on our hearts today. In Lord today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart and save me from the sins that I've committed. I ask you to forgive me of those sins and be my Savior today.
[time=3530] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3534] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3538] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3546] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the book by Charles Swindall entitled "Living Above the Level of mediocrity" please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
