[time=120] (bells chiming) (bells chiming) A man spent his entire life as an avowed atheist.
[time=129] When he died, his friends had written upon his tombstone.
[time=132] Here lies an atheist.
[time=135] All dressed up and no place to go.
[time=138] But you know the Bible teaches that that just isn't true.
[time=141] God's Word said that in this life, if we do not believe on Jesus Christ, then we will not spend eternity with him.
[time=148] If we don't believe on Jesus Christ in this life, we will spend eternity separated from him in a place of eternal torment and punishment.
[time=158] All dressed up and no place to go.
[time=161] I'm sure that many atheists who have passed away now wish that that were so.
[time=166] (bells chiming)
[time=169] [MUSIC]
[time=175] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=180] Thank you for joining us.
[time=182] Speaking today is our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=185] Jim's message is entitled "Life at the Crossroads." His text is taken from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 7, Verses 13 and 14.
[time=195] Our special music today will be provided by Marcia Peterson and Lisa Reniker.
[time=203] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "The Gateway to His Kingdom."
[time=211] [MUSIC - 452 seconds]
[time=673] We have the privilege this morning of welcoming back Marcia Peterson, who is formerly a member of our church and now lives in the Upper Peninsula in Michigan.
[time=682] We're delighted that when she comes back to this area we get word through her relative that she's going to be here because she has a tremendous voice.
[time=689] She loves to sing for the Lord.
[time=691] We sang and do we have the experience of knowing Christ is our Savior and that's a bit of heaven right here on this earth.
[time=697] But there are things to come when we behold him. He says he will return and come again for us.
[time=702] That's the theme of her song this morning. Let's listen as she sings for us.
[time=706] [MUSIC - 321 seconds]
[time=1040] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=1044] It wasn't that a wonderful solo from Marsha Ives Peterson.
[time=1047] Marsha was a former member of our church a number of years ago, got married and moved to Escanaba in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
[time=1055] We're glad that she's down here visiting today, and we certainly enjoyed that song speaking of the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[time=1062] And Jim, we welcome you to the insert today, and look forward to your message in a little while.
[time=1066] Tell us what you're going to speak on this morning.
[time=1068] Well, first of all, good morning, Pete.
[time=1070] It's always a pleasure to be here with you.
[time=1072] Pete, what I'm speaking on this morning is the important subject of life at the Crossroads.
[time=1078] C.S. Lewis, a great theologian, made the comment one time that every man in this life comes face to face with Jesus Christ and must make a decision to either accept him or reject him.
[time=1089] This morning, I'm preaching from the words of our Lord about that decision.
[time=1093] We must either enter through the narrow gate of everlasting life or enter through the wide gate, which leads to eternal destruction.
[time=1100] Well, Jim, Marsha talked about the fact that we shall behold him.
[time=1103] The we is those that love the Lord Jesus Christ and know him as personal Savior, and we'll be with him in heaven if we do accept that eternal life that he gives.
[time=1113] I'm looking forward to your message.
[time=1115] We've talked in the last weeks about new programs gearing up at Blackhawk this fall.
[time=1119] I know you're involved in some of them.
[time=1121] I think they're getting ready to begin this week.
[time=1123] They've already begun, Pete.
[time=1125] It's really been great.
[time=1126] Wednesday programs are in full swing.
[time=1128] Awana started with close to 300 children on Wednesday night.
[time=1132] Evangelism explosion is rolling again.
[time=1135] I've began a new Bible study from the book of James entitled "Faith That Works." I know you're involved with the choir on Wednesday nights.
[time=1142] There's a lot happening.
[time=1143] It is indeed a place to belong, Pete.
[time=1145] Blackhawk's lights are on often during the week and not just on Sunday mornings, and we're happy that we can have the ministry to people in our local area in various ways.
[time=1156] For the last month or so, we've been talking to you about a book that we'd like to offer to you entitled "Living Beyond the Level of Mediocrity." This is the last Sunday that we're going to offer this book by Chuck Swindall.
[time=1168] I remember so often when I was hearing the message and hearing from the Scripture, you shall mount up with wings as equals, you shall run and not be weary, and you shall soar.
[time=1179] And that's what this book is all about, encouragement.
[time=1182] And I know that all of us need a good bit of encouragement in this day and age, and so I am encouraging you today to write for this book "Living Beyond the Level of Mediocrity by Chuck Swindall." You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1205] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1211] The zip code is 46815.
[time=1215] Right for the book today, this will be the last time that we'll be offering this book on the Bible Hour.
[time=1220] Well, Jim, we're looking forward to your preaching today, and Tim Teder will be speaking to us for the next two weeks, our associate youth pastor, and then we'll have a guest from the Washington area, David Hegg, and then you'll be speaking toward the end of the month for a couple of weeks, and I'm really glad for our associate pastors and your abilities not only to run some of the extra programs, but to preach too.
[time=1241] I'm afraid we'd be in trouble if I had to do that.
[time=1244] Pete, I've really enjoyed having all these opportunities to speak.
[time=1247] I've also enjoyed listening to our colleague, Tim, but also to all of the people that you've brought in to speak that I had never met or heard before.
[time=1255] It's really been enjoyable.
[time=1256] Thanks, Jim, and we hope that you will continue watching the Bible Hour.
[time=1260] We go back to our regular service now as we enjoy the ministry of music from Lisa Reniker.
[time=1265] Father, we've been blessed.
[time=1274] We blessed us offering this morning that might further your kingdom through the missionaries, through the Bible Hour, through all the projects that this church advocates for you.
[time=1283] We ask this in thy name, amen.
[time=1304] [MUSIC - 122 seconds]
[time=1431] (audience applauding)
[time=1445] - Thank you, Lisa, for that wonderful rendition of a most glorious and wonderful song.
[time=1450] Let's pray.
[time=1451] Father, we thank you this morning that we can worship you in song.
[time=1455] I thank you this morning for a voice that would sound so clearly to the majesty of your name.
[time=1461] Father, thank you for that opportunity to glorify you, to worship you.
[time=1466] Father, this morning, as we present the word, I pray that you would speak to hearts who would need to hear.
[time=1472] Father, this morning, we would also want to come to the throne of grace, to come before you to both thank you and praise you, but to also ask for your healing touch, for you to give strength and comfort to S.E. York as she goes through the latter stages of cancer.
[time=1488] Father, I would just pray that you would give her strength and comfort.
[time=1492] Raise her up each day.
[time=1493] Thank you that she could be with us this morning in our first service.
[time=1497] And Father, I would pray that you would bring healing to allying lots this morning as she suffers from congestive heart failure.
[time=1504] Father, I would just pray that each day you would help her to become stronger.
[time=1509] Give strength to her through the doctors, give wisdom to the nurses and to the doctors as they treat her.
[time=1515] Father, thank you for improvement.
[time=1517] In Cathy Carey, thank you for the fact that after a head injury she can carry on conversations and answer quickly, and I've seen such a tremendous increase in ability.
[time=1528] But Father, as she goes to Indianapolis for further therapy, our prayers would be with her and with her family as she goes.
[time=1535] Father, thank you that Nick Zulman could be back with us today.
[time=1538] That a heart could be back in rhythm and controlled through medication.
[time=1541] Father, thank you and give him strength as he goes back to work soon.
[time=1546] Father, we would also pray for John Schellenbarger as he lays in a coma in Lutheran Hospital.
[time=1552] Father, I would pray that you would bless him, bless his family, but most of all, after a traumatic head injury, that you would bring him forth from that coma.
[time=1560] Father, I would pray that you would raise him up the age of 13, back to his family and friends and to school, that he might get back to those things that young boys love to do so much.
[time=1570] Father, I just ask your blessing upon us now, as we praise your name and as we proclaim the word in Christ's name.
[time=1577] [AMEN] Well, thank you so much for being with us on this most beautiful Labor Day weekend.
[time=1586] Labor Day, when I was a child, traditionally, was the last holiday weekend before you went back to school.
[time=1593] Of course, in the years that have passed since then, most of our school systems now go back before the Labor Day weekend.
[time=1600] It's been a joy to have the children here at Black Hawk Christian School for almost two weeks, and by now, all of our area of public and private schools are back in session.
[time=1609] It's the beginning of a new school year, beginning of a new time of learning, and of growth and maturity.
[time=1616] Well, this week, as I pondered that, I was reading an article written by a public school teacher, and what she had done was she was relating some of the notes from parents that she has saved over the years as a teacher.
[time=1629] Those notes that parents write to teachers to excuse their children from absences or to write and to excuse them from physical education classes when they have a problem.
[time=1639] The notes that she had saved were ones where there were grammatical mistakes or perhaps the wrong word was used, and it caused quite a different meaning from what the parent wanted to say.
[time=1649] Let me just read a couple of these to you.
[time=1652] This one wrote, "My son is under a doctor's care and should not take physical education today.
[time=1658] Please execute him." (Laughter) Another wrote, "Please excuse Mary for being absent.
[time=1667] She was sick, so I took her to the doctor and had her shot." I think that was my favorite.
[time=1674] In an extreme case of people losing things, one wrote, "Please excuse Fred from physical education for a few days.
[time=1681] He fell yesterday out of a tree and misplaced his hip." (Laughter) And lastly, "Mary could not come to school today because she was bothered by very close veins." (Laughter) Well, as we start the new school year, let's pray for our children.
[time=1701] Pray for our schools.
[time=1702] Pray that it'll be a great year of growth for them.
[time=1705] If you have a Bible with you, I'd like you to turn with me to the seventh chapter of the Book of Matthew, the seventh chapter of the Book of Matthew in a message that I have titled, "Life at the Crossroads." Life at the cross-law roads, as Jesus finishes up the Sermon on the Mount and gives a tremendous challenge to those that are within hearing of his words on that day, and a tremendous challenge for us also as we study and read his word.
[time=1734] Let's pray once again for the Lord's blessing upon our time together.
[time=1738] Father, thank you for the way that you have met with us.
[time=1741] Thank you for the joy that you bring us, and I just ask now that you would speak through me as I present your word in Christ's name.
[time=1748] [AMEN] Every day of our lives, we make many choices.
[time=1754] In fact, over the course of even one day, we make a multitude of choices.
[time=1759] Some of those choices are important, and we take time to think about them carefully, but others are really fairly simple, and we barely think about them.
[time=1768] Some of those simple choices that we make are things such as, "What time will I get up in the morning?" I want you to know that the alarm clock went off at six o'clock this morning at the Pearson House, and I immediately had to make a choice.
[time=1780] Would I get out of bed at six o'clock and take an additional 30 or 40 minutes to review my notes and smooth out my message?
[time=1788] Or would I just roll back over and get another 45 minutes of rest?
[time=1792] I'm not going to tell you what decision I made.
[time=1794] I'll let you draw that conclusion for yourself, but every day we make minor decisions.
[time=1799] We decide what we'll wear to work in the course of a day, what we will eat for breakfast.
[time=1804] As we leave the office at noon and get into our car, we make a decision as to where we will eat our lunch.
[time=1810] We make a lot of minor decisions, but we also make those major ones.
[time=1815] You can think back, I'm sure with me, as you think upon those major decisions.
[time=1819] We all make major decisions such as who we will marry.
[time=1823] We make major decisions when we decide what home we will buy or what car we will drive.
[time=1829] Those are very important decisions, and there are great ramifications and consequences that go with them.
[time=1836] I remember one day in June of 1974, I was drowned in Central Ohio, and I was interviewing for a teaching position that I wanted to get.
[time=1846] It was the day that I would graduate from college.
[time=1849] It was also the day that I would interview and land my first job as a teacher out of college.
[time=1855] Well, I went to that interview, and as I began to look at my watch, I noticed that the time was moving along quite quickly, and it was very possible that I was going to be late for my graduation if I didn't get going soon.
[time=1867] My parents and relatives were there.
[time=1870] They were going to be there expecting me to walk across the stage.
[time=1873] I kind of wanted to do that myself, and so I didn't know what to do.
[time=1877] Well, finally, the interview was over, and the superintendent shook my hand, said the job is yours, and I walked out the door and immediately thought, "How am I going to get back to Toledo in time to get out to college and walk across the stage?" It was probably about a two and a half hour trip.
[time=1893] I only had about two hours to get there.
[time=1895] It was going to be difficult.
[time=1897] Well, I had to make a decision.
[time=1899] I had to decide whether I would follow the speed limit and go 55 miles an hour, or whether I would add some miles per hour to my speed and make it back on time for graduation.
[time=1911] Well, in those days before I came to know the Lord, I made an immediate decision that I would speed and do whatever it took to get back to Toledo on time.
[time=1920] Well, I began to cruise on back toward Toledo about 75 miles an hour, and things were going very well for probably the first 60 or 70 miles.
[time=1929] But there's a little town south of Toledo, about 50 miles, and they're known for their speed traps, and I wasn't watching, and it wasn't long before I looked up in the rear view mirror quickly, and there I saw the policemen staring at me through the rear of my window.
[time=1945] If you ever noticed when you look up and see them for that first moment, they looked like they're about two inches off your bumper.
[time=1951] This guy looked like Jackie Gleason, and he was staring right at me, and I immediately knew that I'd been had because I was speeding, and so I immediately pulled over to the side of the road.
[time=1961] Well, he got out of his car, and I could tell that he was not real thrilled with me for speeding in his territory and in his little town.
[time=1969] He walked up to the side of my car, and I rolled down the window.
[time=1973] He kind of slowly took off his sunglasses, looked at me with quite a bit of disdain,
[time=1979] and said something like, "Son, I didn't know Mario Andretti had any relatives that lived in this part of Ohio." Well, I explained to him that I had to get back for graduation, that I was going through this process of getting back and trying to get to graduation.
[time=1994] I told him I had just got a job, and he kind of looked at me rather unforgivingly and said, "Oh, today's your college graduation, huh, son?" I said, "Yeah?" He said, "Well, congratulations.
[time=2006] It looks like I'm going to be the first one to give you a graduation present." Fifty-eight dollars.
[time=2012] In 1974 dollars, that was a big fine, but I deserved it.
[time=2016] I made a decision, and I had to pay the consequences, and I knew that I was wrong.
[time=2022] Well, somehow I made it back for graduation.
[time=2026] In the seventh chapter of the book of Matthew, Jesus is speaking about decision-making.
[time=2032] He is speaking about the most important decision that we will ever make as people who walk this earth.
[time=2040] For Jesus is not speaking about deciding what we will eat for breakfast.
[time=2045] He's not deciding about what we will wear or where we will go or what house we will buy.
[time=2050] He's even speaking about a more important decision than who we will marry.
[time=2054] Jesus in this text is finishing up the Sermon on the Mount, and he has been speaking about the standards of the kingdom, the standards of kingdom living.
[time=2065] And now he looks at those who are believers, but he also looks at those scribes and Pharisees who have been listening, and he tells them, "You must make a decision." In verses 13 and 14 of chapter 7 of the book of Matthew, Jesus said this,
[time=2083] "Enter through the narrow gate.
[time=2086] For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction." And many enter through it, but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life,
[time=2097] and only a few find it.
[time=2100] This morning I would like us for the next 25 minutes or so to ponder this text, and as we do, I would like to point out to you four contrasts.
[time=2110] Four contrasts found in these verses which I believe illustrate the importance of choosing Jesus Christ in this life.
[time=2119] Four contrasts that will point out to us the importance in this life of making a decision
[time=2125] to enter through the narrow gate and to choose a life of service to Jesus Christ.
[time=2132] The first contrast that I would like to point out is the two contrasting gates found in verse 13.
[time=2138] The two contrasting gates.
[time=2141] Jesus says, "Enter through the narrow gate." And then he says, "For wide is the gate and broad the road that leads to destruction."
[time=2152] Jesus points out, first of all, two gates, two very, very contrasting gates, the narrow gate and the wide gate.
[time=2160] And he says, "If you choose me, enter you through the narrow gate."
[time=2166] Notice the first word in verse 13 demands a decision.
[time=2171] It's called in the Greek language, an erist imperative.
[time=2175] He says, "Enter through the narrow gate." Jesus is saying that we must make a conscious decision.
[time=2182] We must take a definite action, and at some time in this life,
[time=2188] if we want to spend eternity with him, we must enter through the narrow gate.
[time=2194] We must enter through the gate, which is Jesus Christ.
[time=2198] Let's talk about that narrow gate for a few moments before we move on.
[time=2202] The narrow gate, the Bible says, is the way of Jesus Christ.
[time=2206] The narrow gate is the only way of salvation.
[time=2211] The Bible teaches not so much here, but in various other verses that Jesus Christ represents the narrow gate and that the only way
[time=2221] of ever knowing that we have salvation and knowing that we can have everlasting life is to trust in him and walk through that gate as we walk through these steps that we call life.
[time=2235] Now you might say, "Well, Jim, that's reading a lot into that verse." I don't see all of that said there, but you know if you take this verse and then take it and compare it with a lot of other Scripture, you'll see that that's definitely what Jesus meant.
[time=2248] For in John chapter 14, Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."
[time=2255] No man comes to the Father, but by me.
[time=2258] In Acts chapter 4, Peter said, "Salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given by men by which we must be saved."
[time=2268] There is no other way of salvation, but through Jesus Christ.
[time=2273] Then there's another question you might ask is then, if Jesus Christ is the gate and we are to enter through the narrow gate, then how is it or what is the process that we must go through for walking through that gate?
[time=2287] The Bible is also very clear on that issue.
[time=2290] It says that in this life, we must repent of our sins.
[time=2294] We must receive Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord.
[time=2298] We must turn to him and only when we trust in him by faith in his death on the cross
[time=2305] have we entered through the narrow gate and entered unto everlasting life.
[time=2311] Oh, the Bible is very clear.
[time=2313] There are many today who would teach that that isn't true.
[time=2317] There are those even within Christendom who would teach that salvation is through some good work,
[time=2323] that salvation is universal and that all someday will be saved.
[time=2328] That's not what Jesus said.
[time=2330] There are new age religions today which will teach not only are you all going to be saved but you can even become like God Himself as you go through life and as you go through life and then another life and another life.
[time=2342] All those teachings are all false.
[time=2344] Jesus said enter through the narrow gate.
[time=2347] But we need for a moment to look at what He meant by the wide gate.
[time=2350] If you reject the narrow gate, what does it mean then to enter through the wide gate?
[time=2356] What is the wide gate?
[time=2358] That's the way of the world.
[time=2360] That's the way of those who choose not to receive Jesus Christ in this life.
[time=2365] They reject Him and His claims and they go off on their own and go their own way.
[time=2371] Jesus said it's the way of the majority.
[time=2374] It's the way of self-centeredness.
[time=2377] It's the gate of self-deception.
[time=2381] It's the gate of self-indulgence.
[time=2387] Jesus said it's the opposite of what I challenge you to do.
[time=2391] It's not the narrow gate.
[time=2393] It's the wide gate.
[time=2395] And most will choose to go that way.
[time=2397] And Jesus says that is the way that leads to destruction.
[time=2405] This week as I was preparing the message, I was looking for conversion experiences of various believers.
[time=2411] And I went to the library and grabbed off the shelf many books and I read about the conversion experience of Billy Graham, the great evangelist.
[time=2418] And I read about the conversion experience of Tom Landry, the former coach of the Dallas Cowboys, of Oral Hirschheiser, the great pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
[time=2428] But the one that I felt perhaps illustrated the importance of decision-making was one that I read about a man to the name of Harold Morris.
[time=2436] Harold Morris was a man, as a young man who basically had life made.
[time=2441] He was married to a Christian wife, although he himself was not a believer.
[time=2446] He had never trusted in Christ, but he had had a pretty good education.
[time=2450] He had a very fine job at an insurance company in the city where he lived.
[time=2455] But Harold Morrison wrote in his book entitled Twice Pardon that he got restless.
[time=2460] He decided that he didn't want to stay married to one woman for the rest of his life.
[time=2465] And he went about to the other side and living a wilder life.
[time=2469] He began selling and taking drugs.
[time=2472] He began running with the wrong crowd and gambling.
[time=2475] And it wasn't long before he had completely left his former life and was deeply involved in the ways of that sordid world that he had become involved in.
[time=2484] Well, one night he unwittingly became the driver of a getaway car from a murder scene.
[time=2490] He didn't know that the people that he was with were going to do it, but they jumped in the car.
[time=2494] And as he sped away out of the city of Atlanta, Georgia, he realized that they had murdered somebody and he realized what trouble he was in.
[time=2503] Eventually he was arrested.
[time=2506] The two other men turned state's evidence and said that Harold was the one that had pulled the trigger.
[time=2510] Harold was the one who had killed this man.
[time=2513] He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to two consecutive life prison sentences.
[time=2519] Oh, at that point he was just going through the process of becoming hard and tough.
[time=2525] But he said that when he entered prison, he had no choice.
[time=2528] He had to be tough.
[time=2530] He had to be mean.
[time=2531] He was in prison serving two consecutive life terms with little or no hope of ever getting out.
[time=2537] But one day a preacher came.
[time=2540] And a preacher presented to him the word of God and said, "Harold, you might be the toughest guy on this earth, but you must make a decision.
[time=2548] And you must decide what life you will live, whether it be here in prison or on the outside." You see, Harold Morrison had to choose the narrow gate of salvation or the wide gate of destruction.
[time=2560] In his book he writes that he chose the narrow gate and he trusted in Christ as his savior and began to live for him in prison.
[time=2568] Praise God he was later pardoned of his crime and was able to get out and be free and is now a great witness for Jesus Christ.
[time=2576] But Harold Morris, like all of us, had to make a decision.
[time=2581] Everyone must make a choice.
[time=2584] If you're here this morning, I want to challenge you and ask you, have you made a decision for Jesus Christ?
[time=2592] The Bible teaches that we all must enter through the narrow gate to salvation in this life.
[time=2598] Have you made that decision for Jesus Christ today?
[time=2602] I'm not speaking about, have you been baptized?
[time=2605] Not speaking about, have you joined a local church?
[time=2609] But I'm speaking about trusting in Christ as savior, coming to him in the new birth,
[time=2615] going through the narrow gate of everlasting life.
[time=2619] Oh, I pray that you have.
[time=2620] But let's move on as we begin to continue.
[time=2623] First of all, the two contrasting gates.
[time=2626] Secondly, the two contrasting roads.
[time=2630] The two gates, the narrow gate and the wide gate lead to two different roads of life and Jesus speaks about them.
[time=2638] Enter through the narrow gate for white is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction.
[time=2644] Jesus describes a broad road, a way of life.
[time=2648] And then he says, but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to everlasting life.
[time=2655] So Jesus begins to talk about two contrasting roads.
[time=2659] The broad road and the narrow road.
[time=2662] The narrow gate leads to the narrow road, the godly road.
[time=2667] The wide gate leads to the worldly road, the road of ungodliness, the road of destruction.
[time=2675] Let's first of all look at what the Bible says about the broad road.
[time=2679] It's the worldly road, the one that has traveled, Jesus says here, by the majority.
[time=2684] It's the easy road.
[time=2686] It's the road that is perhaps the most attractive to the unregenerate person.
[time=2691] It is the one where there are the fewest rules.
[time=2694] It is the one where there are the fewest moral absolutes, if any.
[time=2698] It is the one that is very permissive and allows you to go through life basically doing as you please.
[time=2705] It's the self-centered road, the wide road, the one that says I'm going to do my own thing.
[time=2712] It's the road that has traveled, which does not have the biblical absolutes and obedience to them as the way of life.
[time=2721] Now I want to make something clear. I'm not saying that all who are traveling the broad, wide road,
[time=2727] are traveling a road of wanton sin and debauchery.
[time=2731] No, I'm not saying that this morning and please don't understand.
[time=2734] But what I am saying is that the wide road is the way that rejects Jesus Christ.
[time=2739] It's the way of the society in which we live.
[time=2742] And it's the road that many take, which leads to destruction, the wide road.
[time=2749] Jesus says no, go through the narrow gate and then walk down the narrow road.
[time=2754] I like what Chuck Swindall says about the narrow road.
[time=2757] Chuck Swindall says that when Jesus calls us to go down the narrow road, He is telling us that as individuals we must step out from the majority.
[time=2767] We must be willing to step out from the majority and to be unique and to stand firm for Jesus Christ.
[time=2774] No matter what may come our way. It's the narrow road, the road of obedience, the road of discipleship.
[time=2784] There's not a lot in this text that deals with what the narrow road is.
[time=2788] But you see the context of our message today is the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2792] Jesus is drawing to a close this great message from the Mount of Olives.
[time=2797] And so to see what Jesus meant by the narrow road merely needs to go back into the Sermon on the Mount
[time=2803] and see exactly what Jesus said was the way that we were supposed to live.
[time=2808] The narrow road is the way of humility.
[time=2811] It's the way of godliness. It's the way of looking out for others and for looking out for their good and loving them.
[time=2820] It's a way of reaching out in love to all who have need.
[time=2824] It's the way of peace, the way of righteousness, of purity in heart.
[time=2829] In essence, it's the way of discipleship, of standing firm for Jesus Christ.
[time=2836] No matter what comes our way.
[time=2839] Being willing to step out from among the majority.
[time=2842] A few years ago in a secret church in Russia, there was a small body of believers who met secretly on a regular basis.
[time=2850] One day one of them was able to smuggle into their meeting a copy of the gospel according to Luke.
[time=2856] They were rejoiced that they could have a copy of God's word from which to study.
[time=2861] But they feared that they soon might lose it.
[time=2864] And so they decided that they would tear the gospel of Luke apart and hand parts of it to each of the members of the church
[time=2871] and that they would each memorize a portion.
[time=2874] And then when they came back to church for the next Lord's Day, they would gather together and they would switch the parts then to other people.
[time=2882] And over time, they would each memorize as much of the gospel of Luke as they could.
[time=2887] And if Luke's gospel was ever taken away, they would have it committed to memory.
[time=2892] And there would be those who could repeat what they needed to hear.
[time=2896] Well, they took their parts home and they began to memorize, but finally the Lord's Day came.
[time=2902] That Sunday morning, a few began to gather at that little secret house church.
[time=2908] They didn't want to come many at a time.
[time=2911] They wanted to come one or two at a time so as not to raise a great deal of suspicion on the part of the Russian soldiers and guards.
[time=2920] But by the time the day had ended and dusk was setting in, a large group had gathered within this secret home and was beginning to worship.
[time=2929] But just as they began to worship, two Russian guards kicked in the door and with machine guns pointed at them said,
[time=2936] "All right, everyone who believes in Jesus Christ up against the wall, raise your hands." They all did.
[time=2943] The guards then said, "If you want to renounce Jesus Christ, if you want to renounce your faith in Jesus Christ, you can save your life.
[time=2952] Leave now, you have two minutes." As the clock ticked by, one left, and then another, and then another, and then several.
[time=2962] And finally, there was only a small remnant that was left behind.
[time=2967] When the two minutes were up, the guards went, slammed the door, turned to the ones that were left and said, "All right, again, up against the wall, put your hands in the air." But then they broke into a wide smile and they said, "And praise Jesus Christ our Savior because we too are believers.
[time=2983] We too are believers.
[time=2985] We once went to a house church to break in and to arrest them.
[time=2989] But when we got there, they gave their testimony to Jesus Christ and we were convicted and we became believers.
[time=2997] And so we have these jobs as Russian guards, but the only people that we can trust, the only people that we can share this with are the ones who are willing to stand firm and to die for their faith.
[time=3010] They're the only ones that can be trusted.
[time=3014] A remnant stood behind, stepped out from the majority and said, "We will stand for Jesus Christ no matter what the punishment." That's the narrow road.
[time=3024] That's the narrow road in Russia today.
[time=3027] That was the narrow road in Jesus day.
[time=3030] In our society today, for you, the narrow road might be something different.
[time=3035] Perhaps you're a businessman here today and you're attempting to walk the narrow road.
[time=3041] For you in walking the narrow road of service to Jesus Christ, it may mean that at times you may not be able to close the big deal that you wanted to close because of your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3053] It prevents you from doing something that you know is ethically wrong.
[time=3057] In the corporation that you work for, it may cause some of you, men and women who work there, to be passed over for a promotion because of a stand you take for something that you may not be willing to do because of your faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3071] It means that possibly sometimes the deal may not get done.
[time=3076] Jesus says, "Stand firm in your faith." If you're a student here this morning and you're in one of our area schools, "Oh, thank God that you're there. I thank God that you're testifying for Jesus Christ." But the Bible says, "Stand firm when the persecution comes." Stand firm that when you're teased about carrying your Bible, you can stand firm and give testimony to Him. Walk the narrow road.
[time=3101] Perhaps you're a mother and living in the neighborhood where you are.
[time=3105] And there are some activities that you don't want your young children involved in.
[time=3109] And so you control their life a little bit more than some of the others in the neighborhood.
[time=3113] And you watch what they say and what they do.
[time=3116] "Oh, I thank you for that. For walking the narrow road.
[time=3119] For knowing that there are biblical standards and raising your children up in the way that they should go. Walk the narrow road.
[time=3127] Perhaps you're here this morning. Perhaps you're here this morning and you're walking the wide road. The road that Jesus said leads to destruction.
[time=3136] It's not too late to get off the wide road and to get back to the narrow one.
[time=3141] The one that leads to everlasting life.
[time=3144] Two contrasting roads. And then thirdly, two contrasting destinations.
[time=3149] Two contrasting destinations. Notice he says, "Broad is the road that leads where? To destruction.
[time=3157] One destination. Destruction." And many enter through it.
[time=3161] But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to where?
[time=3165] To life. To life everlasting.
[time=3168] Jesus in this text teaches that there are two contrasting destinations for all of us who walk through this life.
[time=3176] Those of us that choose to walk through the narrow gate and then to walk down the narrow path of discipleship.
[time=3182] The Bible says we will go unto the destination of eternal life with Jesus Christ in a place called heaven.
[time=3190] But it also says that those who choose the wide gate, the way of the world, those who reject Christ in this life and who walk down the wide road will also have a destination and Jesus calls it a place of eternal destruction.
[time=3204] Sounds hard. The last thing that we want to do this morning is to scare or to try to be insensitive.
[time=3212] But the Bible teaches that there is a place of eternal destruction.
[time=3217] A place which the Bible calls hell.
[time=3220] It's a place where those who reject Christ in this life and who refuse to trust in him as Savior will go if they don't repent of their sins.
[time=3231] The Bible teaches very strongly that there is a place called heaven.
[time=3235] Jesus spoke about it many times.
[time=3237] In Luke chapter 23 when he spoke to the thief on the cross, he said today you will be with me in paradise.
[time=3244] Today you will be with me in a place called heaven.
[time=3247] The Bible speaks about heaven in many other areas.
[time=3251] In John chapter 14 Jesus said in my father's house or many mansions, "If it were not so, I would have told you.
[time=3258] And if I go to prepare a place for you which is heaven, I will then come one day and receive you that you might also go there to be with me." There's life everlasting for those who trust in Christ.
[time=3271] It's a place of eternal joy, a place of worship, of holiness, a fellowship, a place where there will be no sin, no pain, no death.
[time=3281] A wonderful destination for all who trust in him.
[time=3286] But he also says that there is a place of eternal destruction.
[time=3289] And did you know what the Bible speaks more about hell than it does about heaven?
[time=3296] It speaks a lot about eternal destinations called hell for those who don't trust in Christ.
[time=3303] Jesus spoke, or I should say in the book of Revelation, it speaks about the lake of fire.
[time=3308] It speaks about a place of torment where all those will go, whose names are not found written in the Lamb's book of life.
[time=3316] Oh, I don't know all of what hell will be.
[time=3320] I do believe that I have some ideas.
[time=3322] I believe that part of it will be knowing that what you're missing.
[time=3326] I believe that a part of eternal destruction will be knowing what you're missing in heaven, like the rich man who looked up and saw Lazarus and Abraham's bosom, and saw what he was missing and knew how much he was suffering.
[time=3343] Oh, as I said this morning, it's not our goal to be scaring anyone today, but I would be remiss as a proclaimer of God's word if I did not proclaim the whole counsel of Jesus' word, and it says that there is a destination for those who don't trust in him.
[time=3361] Now, what does that mean to us today?
[time=3364] First of all, let me say, if you're a believer, please don't say, well, I'm a believer, it's settled between me and Christ.
[time=3372] I don't have to listen to the words that are being spoken today.
[time=3375] Oh, I pray that you would listen, because the Bible teaches that truth, and I believe that if it truly teaches that truth and it does, that an urgency and a desire should well up in all of our hearts as believers to proclaim the gospel, to share our faith, and if indeed that destination exists for those who don't believe, then we need to be going about trying to gather as many and bring them through the narrow gate into the kingdom of God before this dispensation of grace is over.
[time=3404] Oh, I believe that you can do that.
[time=3406] I believe we need to testify of our faith.
[time=3409] This Wednesday night, we have a great program which begins once again, it's called Evangelism Explosion.
[time=3416] This morning, you can make a decision.
[time=3418] To enter into this program of EE, Evangelism Explosion, to learn how to share your faith more effectively, to learn how to share your faith in such a way that, through the Holy Spirit of God working upon hearts, you can be a part of this great harvest of souls.
[time=3433] Won't you think about evangelism?
[time=3436] Or perhaps it might be a wana this morning?
[time=3439] I'm convinced that as we open up the gates to a wana, this Wednesday night, and as perhaps 300 kids stream into our building across the street, I'm convinced that many of them will hear God's word as youngsters.
[time=3452] But I also believe that many, if we don't win them to the Lord now, as they come from the neighborhoods throughout the Black Hawk area, that perhaps they'll never come to Jesus Christ.
[time=3463] They need to hear the word now.
[time=3465] You can help with a wana this morning.
[time=3468] Oh, perhaps you are not a believer, you're an unbeliever this morning.
[time=3473] I'd just like to say, once again, the Bible speaks very strongly about the fate of those who choose not to believe.
[time=3480] It would be our prayer this morning.
[time=3483] And in a few moments as we sing, it would be our prayer this morning that you would do business with God.
[time=3489] Take that step of faith, trust in Him, walk through the narrow gate, go down that journey of the narrow way, knowing that someday you will have that eternal destiny in a place called heaven.
[time=3503] Oh, so much this morning.
[time=3505] It's my goal that that would be a decision that all who would need to make that would make.
[time=3511] But then quickly and fourthly, notice.
[time=3514] We've been sharing with you this morning the ministry of our sanctuary
[time=3520] choir and soloist, Marcia Peterson and Lisa Reniker.
[time=3524] The message today was from our associate pastor, Jim Pearson.
[time=3528] The choir sang just a few minutes ago, the gateway to the kingdom is across, accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Savior gives you the opportunity to live with Him forever in heaven.
[time=3539] I wonder if you've done that.
[time=3541] If you've not accepted Christ today, would you bow and pray this prayer with me right now?
[time=3546] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3553] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3557] I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3562] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3566] If you prayed that prayer this morning, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3571] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance, to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3579] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the book by Charles Wendell entitled, "Living Above the Level of Mediocrity," please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
