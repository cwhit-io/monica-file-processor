[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] Last year in the U.S. News & World Report, a poll was taken that showed us that the average American during his or her lifetime will spend six months waiting in a stoplight and five months waiting in some line.
[time=101] I don't know if you're like me, but many times I get impatient and even angry when I have to wait.
[time=106] I'm glad God isn't the same way.
[time=108] I'm glad that God puts His anger on hold many times when He deals with us.
[time=113] Join us today as we consider the patience of God.
[time=117] (music playing)
[time=126] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study, Music & Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=131] Thank you for joining us.
[time=133] Speaking today is our youth pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=136] Tim's message is entitled "God's Anger on Hold." His text is taken from the book of Psalms, chapters 78, verses 38 and 39.
[time=146] Special music today includes an instrumental duet from David and Debbie Johnson and a solo from Marilyn Wong.
[time=155] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled "A Mighty Fortress."
[time=163] (music playing)
[time=201] For still our ancient home, the sea to work us for, is trapped and power our great, and our withdrawal reigns.
[time=220] (music playing)
[time=242] We're not the right men on our side, the men of God's own choosing.
[time=255] (music playing)
[time=392] (applause) It is a privilege to sing of the power and the might of our Lord.
[time=401] Our Christianity and our faith is built on that solid rock, Jesus Christ.
[time=406] My faith is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[time=411] Him number 404, please, we'll sing verses 1, 3, and 4 of Him number 404.
[time=418] (music playing)
[time=528] It's a great confirmation of the chorus that we learned when we were in Sunday school that the wise man built his house upon the rock, the foolish man upon the sand.
[time=537] We need to put our trust in the rock Christ Jesus. Thank you for your good singing and that portion of our service that helps us to minister together and to celebrate the victory in Jesus Christ.
[time=550] Throughout the year we usually have David and Debbie Johnson here as David plays in the Fort Wayne Philharmonic.
[time=556] In the summertime they go to Chicago where he plays in the Grant Park Symphony.
[time=561] We're delighted though that they've come back again to Fort Wayne for the fall and appreciate their ministry and music, its quality and its very sincere and we're grateful for that.
[time=570] Let's listen as they blend their instruments together with the theme "My Jesus, I love thee, I know thou art mine."
[time=583] (music playing)
[time=731] I want to say a warm hello to you and thank you again for watching the Bible Hour.
[time=736] If you've ever written into the Bible Hour perhaps this week you received a letter from the Bible Hour talking to you about the Founders Club.
[time=744] This club is a group of people who have banded together to support the Bible Hour on a monthly basis.
[time=751] We're so grateful for those of you that continue that support month after month and even already some have raised that support for this next year.
[time=758] And if you've never become a member of the Founders Club this is a great way to support the ministry of the Bible Hour and we hope that we hear from you this week.
[time=768] With me today in the studio is Tim Teder, our Associate Pastor, good morning Tim.
[time=773] Good morning Pete.
[time=774] Tim's going to be speaking to us again today and we already heard the tease and are anxious to get into the message.
[time=780] Tell us a little bit about what you're going to be talking about.
[time=783] Well I've been thinking recently about the patience of God and what that means in our life.
[time=788] I don't know how you are as a father with your children.
[time=790] Just speaking for myself, I get frustrated at so many times when I become impatient with my own children.
[time=796] I don't want to be like that.
[time=798] But when I realize sometimes how I am makes me that much more thankful that God as my Heavenly Father doesn't become impatient with me in the same way.
[time=806] I'm just so thankful that He puts His anger on hold and deals with me in a loving, compassionate way.
[time=812] When I deserve otherwise sometimes we're going to talk about, consider that this morning.
[time=815] It sounds like a theme that all of us can use especially those of us that have children.
[time=819] It just seems like we can never get enough patience to work with our kids and even people with whom we come in contact.
[time=825] Sometimes we just get a little edgy and we need that admonition again of how patient God is with us and I too am very thankful for that.
[time=833] Last week Tim spoke on the theme "Blueprint for Building Lives".
[time=838] He talked about individual lives.
[time=840] We are also kicking off a fundraising campaign for 10 classrooms and a new gymnasium for Black Hawk Baptist Church in Christian school.
[time=849] That's going to be a great fundraising effort in the next two months.
[time=854] I hope that as we tell you about it you'll just remember to pray for us that God will give us clear direction as to when and how long we should take before we build.
[time=865] That's very important and we want to have His direction.
[time=868] And Tim while we're talking about physical structures we're also concerned about our own people and the people to whom we minister.
[time=875] I wish the Bible our viewers could see some of the excitement of our people surrounding this project.
[time=880] I also hope they understand that we're not just interested in building another building, another structure.
[time=887] But our primary goal is really to affect lives for Jesus Christ.
[time=891] I hope that always will be the goal that we have as Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=895] I think our growth has been just simply as it relates to buildings because we feel that that can be a more effective way that we can reach people and strengthen lives.
[time=906] We hope we have that in clear perspective in the coming months.
[time=910] Last week I talked a little bit about the fact that we were looking over some of the booklets that we had in our library.
[time=917] And Carolyn Dick, the lady that does all of the mailing for us and keeps track of the books that we offer to you on the Bible Hour, went through and suggested some of the most popular booklets that we've sent out in recent weeks.
[time=930] We have another booklet for you today that's entitled Self Worth.
[time=934] This booklet was written by Dr. Joseph Ulrich.
[time=937] He's the president of Multnomah Christian School out in Portland, Oregon.
[time=943] Tim, this book reminded me of a passage of Scripture in Romans, the twelfth chapter in the third verse.
[time=950] It says, "For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith."
[time=965] In the scriptures here in the King James it says, "To think soberly." In the Phillips translation it says, "To have a sane assessment of oneself."
[time=973] We're very much aware that we're really nothing but by the grace of God who saved us.
[time=978] And yet when Christ comes into our lives we become sons and daughters of the King. That's very exciting for me.
[time=984] And this is what the book talks about.
[time=987] It encourages you to get involved with other people, to have a great value system, and to love one another.
[time=994] And that love is reciprocated back to you so that you can be encouraged and experienced that self-worth.
[time=1001] So we'd like to have you write for this booklet today. I'm going to give you the address just right for the booklet entitled "Self-worth, Right to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815."
[time=1018] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1027] We're certainly grateful that you are watching and Tim we're looking forward to your message in just a few minutes and are thankful that you're a part of our staff and enjoy working with you very much.
[time=1037] We're going to go back to our live portion of the service now and we'll be soon hearing Tim Teder as he speaks to us.
[time=1053] All you children of peace and all you lovers of freedom. All you seekers of justice and all who wait for Messiah to come.
[time=1067] Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice. Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice. For soon he is coming to the earth. Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice.
[time=1088] All who trust in his love. And all who wait for his righteousness. All who tasted his mercy. And all who hope in his faithfulness.
[time=1102] Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice. Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice. For soon he is coming to the earth. Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice.
[time=1117] Hallelujah, holy is his name. Hallelujah, he will reign, forever he will reign.
[time=1140] All you children of peace and all you lovers of freedom. All you seekers of justice and all who wait for Messiah to come.
[time=1154] Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice. Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice. For soon he is coming to the earth. Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice.
[time=1189] Father, this morning we do rejoice, rejoice in the Lord. We look around and we see a lot of things that might discourage us.
[time=1197] We see the situation of the world, we see personal problems that we face. And yet in the knowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord and he rules and that he is coming again to set everything right, we rejoice in that.
[time=1212] Rejoice to your God who keeps his promises and that you are meeting our needs. We rejoice in the fact that even the lives of people in this body, in this church, you are bringing healing where there was one sickness and disease.
[time=1225] We thank you for that which has taken place in life such as Marv Eastland and Sandy Castor and others. God, you have been faithful to us and we thank you for it.
[time=1236] Rejoice because this day we have the opportunity to be together, to worship you, to praise you, to take the word that you've given us and to think about it, to learn from it, to put it into practice.
[time=1250] May that happen today. We come and we pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord in whom we rejoice. Amen.
[time=1261] I wonder what kind of day this has been for you already. We talked a little bit last week how Sunday mornings tend to be one of those mornings in the week, perhaps the worst for many of you when things get hectic.
[time=1276] And have you perhaps today been the recipient of someone's impatience, whether someone being impatient to get into the bathroom that you're occupying at the time or whether you're on the state street ready to turn in and the person behind you doesn't want to go to this church.
[time=1293] They just want to get around you. People get impatient about things. I don't like being the recipient of people's impatience. Although it happens on occasion.
[time=1303] Not too long ago I was visiting a student in our youth program and when I was leaving their home, I was on my way out of the subdivision. I was ready to turn onto a main road.
[time=1316] And as happens sometimes I pulled up behind a woman who's also turning the same direction as myself, but she's one of those people who requires about a half mile of free space before she's ready to turn.
[time=1330] So I waited and I waited and waited and waited and I was being patient, at least outwardly I was being patient.
[time=1340] But the fellow that pulled up behind me in the little red sports car was not quite so patient and didn't take him long to start laying on his horn.
[time=1350] Well this woman in front of me turned around thinking I was honking on her and leans out of her window and starts swearing at me for honking at her.
[time=1359] I was not doing a thing. In the meantime this guy keeps honking, she keeps swearing and it goes on and on. People being impatient, well finally, finally she turns and I turn right behind her and we're going down the road about 30 miles an hour.
[time=1374] And I don't like anyone thinking ill of me, especially when I haven't done anything wrong. So I decided going about 30 miles an hour, I'd pull up alongside her, my passenger window is down, her window is down because she'd rolled down to scream at me.
[time=1387] And so we're going down the road 30 miles an hour and I'm trying to explain to her in a nice calm way, yelling out my window.
[time=1396] It wasn't me meeping my hornage, I was just trying to explain this and apparently she thought I was swearing at her again because she gave me a gesture that wasn't exactly friendly if you know what I mean.
[time=1407] And by that time, all I could think of is someone from Blackhawk driving behind and seeing me and this woman going back and forth.
[time=1416] So I just went on and tried to forget the whole thing, but it bothers me. Even though I know at times I get impatient myself and it happens more often than it should certainly.
[time=1428] But we don't like to be recipients of people's impatience. We like people to be patient with us.
[time=1436] You know, one thing that we can be thankful for is that we serve a God who is a patient, God. He is patient with us.
[time=1446] If you don't know that that's true, let me just read you some examples from Scripture. Now these are passages of Scripture that you're familiar with, so you don't even need to turn to them.
[time=1455] Let me read you the stories and just think about God and how he responds to us.
[time=1463] Now Moses came to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.
[time=1469] And God called to him, "Moses, I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt.
[time=1474] Now I will send you to Pharaohs that you may bring my people out of Egypt." And Moses answered and said, "But they won't believe me. They won't listen to my voice. They will say the Lord has not appeared to you.
[time=1490] God, I am not eloquent. I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
[time=1497] And the anger of the Lord was greatly kindled, and the fire in the midst of the bush came out and consumed Moses.
[time=1506] And later on we read, "One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful.
[time=1515] David sent messengers to get her, and she came to him, and he slept with her.
[time=1520] And God saw the evil David had done, and so he caused the palace to crumble, and the king perished among the ruins."
[time=1529] And finally, you recognize these stories, don't you?
[time=1533] You look at me with some question for some reason.
[time=1536] Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him.
[time=1541] "You're with Jesus in Galilee," she said, "but he denied it before them all." "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
[time=1549] Then he went out into the gateway where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."
[time=1555] But he denied it again with an oath, "I don't know the man." After a while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."
[time=1567] Then he began to call down curses on himself and swore to them, "I tell you, I don't know the man."
[time=1575] And immediately, fire fell from heaven, and behold, Peter was fried.
[time=1581] Now, you know that's not the way those stories ended.
[time=1588] Now if God was not, it was a God who did not demonstrate patience, perhaps we would see the stories ending in these manners.
[time=1596] But we know that despite the fact that Moses doubted God, still he became the greatest leader of all time.
[time=1606] Despite the fact that David disobeyed God, broke his command, yet he became Israel's most honored king.
[time=1616] And even though Peter denied knowing Jesus Christ, still he became one of the greatest leaders, builders of the church.
[time=1626] God is a God of patience. If you have your Bibles and you turn to Psalm, chapter 78.
[time=1630] And we see something of the magnitude of God's patience to the people of Israel.
[time=1636] The writer of the Psalm begins to tell us some of the background, the historical background of the people of Israel,
[time=1643] and how they respond to God since the time of his freeing them from captivity in Egypt.
[time=1650] And it tells us a number of things in Psalm 78, and let's just look down through some of the descriptions of the people of Israel.
[time=1658] Verse 10, it says, "They did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law."
[time=1664] Verse 11, "They forgot what he had done." 17, "They continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert
[time=1672] against the most high." Verse 18, "They willingly put God to the test."
[time=1679] The next verse, "They spoke against God." Verse 22, "They did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance."
[time=1685] Verse 32 says, "They kept on sinning and that they did not believe." Now follow with me as we begin reading in verse 34.
[time=1694] It says, "Whenever God slew them, they would seek him." They remembered that God was their rock, that God most high was their redeemer.
[time=1705] But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues.
[time=1710] Their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.
[time=1714] Yet, here we have it in verse 38, "Yet he was merciful, he forgave their iniquities, he did not destroy them.
[time=1725] Time after time, he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath."
[time=1731] He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
[time=1737] Time after time, he restrained his anger, the patience of God.
[time=1743] God put his anger on hold.
[time=1746] When the people of Israel deserve to be wiped out, God was patient.
[time=1754] God was patient.
[time=1755] He put his anger on hold.
[time=1757] Let's consider the patience of God this morning.
[time=1762] What it's meant to other people and what it means to us.
[time=1767] God was patient with Moses, even when Moses doubted.
[time=1773] Moses wasn't the only person in Scripture to doubt.
[time=1777] We look at the story of Abraham and Sarah as the angel of the Lord comes to them.
[time=1782] At this time, Abraham is nearly 100 years old, Sarah is in her 90s.
[time=1788] The angel of the Lord comes to Abraham and says, "Through your wife, Sarah, I am going to give you a son."
[time=1794] Now, Sarah was past the age of being able to even give birth.
[time=1798] And we read the account in Scripture, we look in Genesis, we see it, says that Abraham fell on his face and he laughed.
[time=1806] And later, it describes Sarah as staying behind the tent flap, snickering at this news that God is going to give us a baby.
[time=1813] This is something for the national enquirer.
[time=1815] It certainly isn't going to happen to us.
[time=1817] They doubted that it could really take place.
[time=1820] And yet it did, and God was patient with them.
[time=1823] God was patient with Gideon.
[time=1825] When he called Gideon to lead the people and victory over the Midianites.
[time=1830] And yet, here in the story, when we see the angel of the Lord coming again to Gideon.
[time=1835] And the first thing is he comes to Gideon and talks to Gideon.
[time=1839] He says, "The Lord is with you, mighty warrior." And Gideon, when he heard the phrase, apparently did one of these jobs, you know.
[time=1851] Because over and over, he gives excuse to the angel.
[time=1855] He can't mean me.
[time=1856] I mean, I'm nobody.
[time=1857] I'm the least of the least of the least.
[time=1859] And he doubts that God can really mean him.
[time=1861] In fact, he doubts God so much that he says, "Okay God, if this is really true, then I want to do this thing with the fleece."
[time=1868] And you know, he said a fleece out to be dry when the ground was wet, to be wet when the ground was dry.
[time=1873] That wasn't an act of faith, it was an act of doubt.
[time=1876] And of course, when we think of doubters in the Bible, we probably most quickly think of Thomas in the New Testament.
[time=1883] Who, when he was told that Jesus Christ was indeed alive after being crucified, said, "I will not believe it unless I am able to see, able to touch." But in all of these instances and in others, God remained patient.
[time=1898] In the midst of even our doubt, God is patient.
[time=1903] And we doubt God, maybe in different ways.
[time=1906] But consider the promises that God has given us.
[time=1909] And the many times that we doubt whether he's really going to be true to the promises that he's said.
[time=1915] God has told us that he will supply every need that we have, Philippians 4 and 19.
[time=1920] And yet what do we do?
[time=1922] We redefine what our needs are.
[time=1924] And then we set ourselves to being worried that these things are really going to be taken care of.
[time=1930] And we wonder whether really God, whether God is really going to take care of everything that we need.
[time=1938] God is said he would.
[time=1939] Sometimes we doubt that.
[time=1941] God says, "I will never leave you.
[time=1943] I will never forsake you." And yet in times when God seems to be silent, times when we come into circumstances that do not make sense to us,
[time=1951] we begin to wonder whether God really is there with us.
[time=1958] When Jesus came in John 10-10, he said the thief comes to destroy and to steal.
[time=1964] "I have come to give you life." And he said, "I have come to give you life that is most abundant.
[time=1970] I have come to give you the fullest kind of life that you can possibly have.
[time=1975] I have come to give you the kind of life that God created you to have, the kind of person God created you to be.
[time=1981] And yet even as Christians sometimes we think that life would really be more fun,
[time=1988] would be more fulfilling, would be more abundant if I did what the crowd was doing over here.
[time=1995] And we doubt that Jesus is really true in what he said about giving us life abundantly.
[time=2001] And many times that we doubt God like Moses.
[time=2005] And yet God puts his anger on hold. God is patient with us. God is patient with me and my doubts.
[time=2013] And I'm thankful for that.
[time=2015] God was patient with Moses when Moses doubted.
[time=2020] God was patient with David when David disobeyed.
[time=2024] David was king of Israel.
[time=2027] He, as much as anyone, perhaps more than anyone should have known the laws and the commands of God.
[time=2034] And I'm sure he did. He certainly knew the ten biggies.
[time=2038] And right there up with them was thou shalt not commit adultery.
[time=2043] And yet David in a moment of choice chose to do what he wanted to do instead of what God said was the right thing to do.
[time=2051] And David disobeyed. David disobeyed. And this wasn't the only sin of David.
[time=2056] I mean there was murder. God had told David the leaders of Israel not to number the people of Israel.
[time=2063] David chose to do that. And all these disobediences, God was patient.
[time=2069] And I am thankful that God is patient in my disobediences.
[time=2073] I'm glad that God puts hold on his anger.
[time=2078] Now you may say, I don't have to worry about God being angry with me.
[time=2082] You see, I'm a child of God.
[time=2084] And God will never deal with me in anger. He would never do that because he loves me.
[time=2089] And a father, a perfect father doesn't deal in anger to their children.
[time=2094] I don't believe that's true. I read Old Testament, New Testament.
[time=2098] I see God in dealing with his people, and sometimes it describes God as dealing with them in anger because of their disobedience and sin.
[time=2106] I'm glad he doesn't always choose to deal with me in that way.
[time=2109] People tell me, as a father, sometimes you know you must never punish your children in anger.
[time=2116] You should hold off until you're not angry anymore.
[time=2119] Well, I take that with some mixed acceptance.
[time=2122] The Bible says there is a proper kind of anger.
[time=2124] The command that's given to us is, do not sin in your anger.
[time=2127] I'll have to admit to you as a father.
[time=2129] There are many times when I discipline my children, and I am angry.
[time=2132] And I'd like to say, well, I'm just angry about what they did, but there are many times when I'm angry at them.
[time=2137] I'm upset about the kind of character they're displaying.
[time=2140] I'm bothered by what they say or how they act.
[time=2143] Now, I'm wrong if I let that anger control what I'm doing.
[time=2148] I'm wrong if I am not responding and disciplined to them in a controlled way that gets out of hand.
[time=2153] It's never an excuse for an abusive kind of punishment at all.
[time=2157] But I do believe that anger has its proper motivation.
[time=2161] And I do believe that God can, even to His own children, respond in anger because of their disobedience.
[time=2167] I'm just thankful that God is also a patient God.
[time=2171] You see, the truth is God has every right to me, to all of us here, to right now judge us, to discipline us, if you will,
[time=2182] to respond in anger for the wrong things.
[time=2184] He would be perfectly right to do that.
[time=2185] He chooses not to because God is a God of patience.
[time=2189] And I'm thankful for that.
[time=2192] Anger and love can go together.
[time=2194] I'm thankful that God demonstrates the aspect of patience most often in my life.
[time=2199] God was patient to Moses and his doubting.
[time=2202] He was patient to David and his disobedience.
[time=2205] He was patient with Peter when Peter denied knowing Christ.
[time=2212] You know, Peter, when he stood in the courtyard, wanting to see what he could find out about the trial of Jesus Christ, find out what was happening to his Lord, his teacher, his master.
[time=2224] In that moment, when people began to question, Peter was fearful.
[time=2229] In that moment, people were afraid that they would see the difference in him, that they would associate him with Jesus Christ.
[time=2236] He was perhaps fearful for his life.
[time=2238] And in that moment, he was ashamed of being a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[time=2245] Now, our denial of Christ may not be quite as overt as Peter's.
[time=2249] We have become more subtle in the ways that we deny God.
[time=2254] And yet we still deny him.
[time=2258] We go out in a public place to eat.
[time=2261] And it's usually our customer habit to pray before we eat.
[time=2264] And for some reason, we don't want to do it because people might see us and think it's a little strange.
[time=2270] It's a little weird.
[time=2271] It's a little too religious or too spiritual.
[time=2274] It might get the wrong idea, so we don't.
[time=2277] I remember going through that conflict when I was in high school thinking, I hear in the cafeteria, I'm used to giving thanks to God for what I have, my food.
[time=2289] What do I do now?
[time=2290] What are people going to think if I bow my head?
[time=2292] And so you do one of these jobbers of slipping your fork off the table.
[time=2296] Oops, got to pick that up.
[time=2297] Dear God, thank you for this food.
[time=2298] Bless me the rest of the day, amen.
[time=2299] Oh, when you go on with your food.
[time=2302] Now, you know, there is nothing inherently spiritual or right about praying before your meals.
[time=2309] There's not.
[time=2310] You can't go to anything in Scripture that says, you know, before you partake of your foods, spend some time in prayer.
[time=2317] And if all of our prayer before meals is, if it's just a ritual, then it really doesn't mean that much.
[time=2322] I mean, we can, for some of us might as well be saying, now I lay me down in the sleep.
[time=2326] Because that's about as much thought as we're putting into our prayers before we eat.
[time=2329] Let me say, if it is our habit, as it is with many of us, to pray before our meal or perhaps to
[time=2335] pray after the meal, giving thanks to God, if that's the habit or tradition that you have to acknowledge thankfulness to God, then to not do that simply because you're
[time=2346] simply because you're concerned of what other people might think about you is a denial of Christ.
[time=2354] We're ashamed, we're fearful. Sometimes we're fearful of witnessing.
[time=2359] God provides an open door and opportunity for us to tell about the hope that we have in us.
[time=2364] And we clam up because we're afraid of what people might think.
[time=2370] We're afraid of what they might say, how we might be treated.
[time=2373] And so we deny being a disciple of Christ by our silence.
[time=2378] There are times we deny Christ, I think, in the way that we compromise our standards in order to not appear too religious.
[time=2388] It might be in a group of people that are speaking or joking in a rather coarse way.
[time=2395] And we stand there and we laugh along with it.
[time=2398] Maybe we even contribute to it because we don't want to appear too out of it, too out of place.
[time=2404] What are we denying?
[time=2405] I know for young people and for all of us, the pressure of wanting to fit in is so strong.
[time=2411] For a young person to be in a group of people going out on a night to do this or to do that.
[time=2420] Sometimes the choice between what would Jesus Christ really be satisfied with?
[time=2427] What would He be doing at this time?
[time=2430] And what is the crowd going to think of me if I go against what they are doing?
[time=2435] That's a hard one to make.
[time=2436] But I think in the times that we choose out of fear to deny what God wants in our life, we are denying Him.
[time=2444] Sometimes in business perhaps a shady deal comes across your desk.
[time=2450] And it's accepted business practice by most people and you know somewhere that's really not right, but we go along with it because we don't want to make waves.
[time=2459] We know that people ask, "Well, why can't you go along with this?" Then we'd have to explain, "Well, you know, I think it's too difficult."
[time=2468] So we deny.
[time=2471] We're saying I don't know Him.
[time=2474] I'm thankful that God has patience.
[time=2477] God has patience with me in the times of how would I feel?
[time=2481] How would you feel to walk into a room and to see a friend and to go up to that friend and want to be with that friend and that person ignores you?
[time=2489] For some reason they want to deny knowing you and so they avoid you.
[time=2492] They walk away from you.
[time=2493] They refuse to acknowledge you when they're around other people.
[time=2495] They won't talk to you.
[time=2497] How would you feel?
[time=2499] And yet we do that to God so often.
[time=2502] And by doing it we deny Him.
[time=2504] And yet God puts His anger on hold.
[time=2508] God is a patient God.
[time=2510] I'm so thankful that He's that way to us.
[time=2514] Now how do we respond to the patience of God?
[time=2517] We know He's a patient God.
[time=2518] We know that's true.
[time=2519] We know that along with His holiness and His justice and the wrath that many times He displays that as much a part of His character as His love and His patience and His mercy that we know that that patience is there and we are recipients of it.
[time=2531] How should we respond in light of God's patience?
[time=2533] Let me offer four suggestions.
[time=2535] Two do's and two don'ts in responding to the patience of God.
[time=2540] First of all a do.
[time=2542] Do thank God for His patience.
[time=2545] We need to thank God that He is a patient God because every day we are recipients of His
[time=2552] patience.
[time=2553] It says in Lamentations 3.22 it says because of His great love we are not consumed.
[time=2560] Because of God's love because of His love and His mercy and His patience we aren't consumed.
[time=2565] You see what we deserve is the instant judgment of God.
[time=2569] We deserve that and God would have the right and still be a good and right God to do that to judge us and yet because of His compassion and His love and His patience we are not consumed.
[time=2580] A lot of people ask the question and we ask it ourselves.
[time=2586] If God is really God why does so many bad things happen to good people?
[time=2594] You ever ask that question why does so many good things happen to bad people?
[time=2600] Let me suggest that the more you get to understand who God is and His holiness and His righteousness
[time=2607] and the more you get to understand who we are in our inadequacies in our sin you begin
[time=2614] to understand that the right question will be and the amazement to us will be why does
[time=2621] so many good things happen to bad people?
[time=2624] We should be amazed at the fact that we are even still alive, that we enjoy the things that we do enjoy.
[time=2631] Those things are only because of the mercy and the love and the patience of God because we don't deserve it and if you think we do then you're wrong.
[time=2639] We don't deserve that.
[time=2640] We deserve the justice, the judgment of God but He's patient with us.
[time=2644] We need to be sure that we give thanks to God for His patience in our life.
[time=2651] Secondly, another do is do be patient yourself, be patient yourself.
[time=2661] I saw a commercial on TV last night, it was a hallmark commercial, I think a father getting a card from his daughter and on the front of this card it said wouldn't it be great if life were like a VCR and then the card is open and inside it says and we could fast
[time=2676] forward through all the crummy parts, wouldn't that be great?
[time=2681] Wouldn't it be good if you could carry around a little remote control of life and you come to those things you've been dreading, those crummy parts of life and you just hit that button till it all just fast forwards out of there.
[time=2692] You come to those good parts and little rewind and let's play that one again.
[time=2696] Life isn't like that.
[time=2697] When we come to crummy parts in our life we have to live through them and we need to be patient.
[time=2704] Now, we want to be patient, I mean I want to be a more of a patient person and it bothers
[time=2711] me sometimes when I look at how I respond even to my own children.
[time=2716] Sometimes I think about how I just reacted to something they did or said or a question they asked and many times it's just much impatient shown in my response.
[time=2726] I don't want to be that way but yet we go to God and we say God make me patient, do it right now, come on.
[time=2735] In the very fact of how we want to get patients, we're not demonstrating patients.
[time=2739] We need to make sure that we're patient people.
[time=2742] We need to learn from our father just like my children, learn their patients or impatience
[time=2748] from their mother and their father, they learn it from us.
[time=2753] So we ought to be learning patients from our heavenly father.
[time=2756] We ought to be able to look and see the way he's responded to us and be willing to learn that kind of patience and to have that kind of long suffering towards other people.
[time=2765] And I do believe patience is something we can learn.
[time=2769] I believe that.
[time=2771] We can learn to be patient people.
[time=2772] When I was in junior high school I had a friend who was a year older than me and Jim Wells was always, he was always a little faster, a little better in everything that we would
[time=2784] compete in and that bothered me.
[time=2788] I always wanted to be better than him in something.
[time=2792] I grew up in Florida and part of our Jim class, very often we would put on our suits and we
[time=2799] would go swimming and I enjoyed swimming and learned to swim well.
[time=2804] But you know Jim is always a little faster and a little better and we come time for the school competitions to see who is the best and fastest swimmer and we'd get up there
[time=2814] on our blocks and we'd jump and we'd go and Jim was always a little faster and a little better and it bothered me.
[time=2821] Well one day I found out something that I thought I could beat him in.
[time=2826] It was rather insignificant but at least I could be better than Jim Wells in swimming the underwater distance swim.
[time=2833] And boy I practiced that.
[time=2835] You better believe I practiced and I already had lungs maybe from singing I don't know but I could get a lot of air in there but I practiced the technique of being able to take in a lot of air, hyperventilating to get oxygen flowing through your bloodstream
[time=2850] so you'd have a good supply as you jumped in the water but you know what I learned?
[time=2854] I learned that probably most of what it took to be good at swimming a distance underwater was mental and I had to learn to be patient.
[time=2863] You know in the New Testament the word that is most often translated patience is a Greek
[time=2869] word that comes from two words meaning to stay under means to stay under means you don't
[time=2875] keep bobbing up and as I practice swimming underwater to beat Jim Wells I learned staying
[time=2882] under because I would hyperventilate, I would get ready, I would jump in that water and I'd begin to swim and just nice steady strokes you know kind of glide along you get to one
[time=2893] in you flip you turn around go back the other way and as you get about the second lap in the pool you start thinking I should probably come up now but you got to stay under you're
[time=2904] going to beat Jim Wells you got to stay under I do another flip I turn back around you know I got to seven, seven laps in that pool being able to swim underwater because I just learned that even when I wanted to come up I stayed under and I think when it comes to the hard
[time=2921] times in our life patience can be learned we can learn to stay under and you know the
[time=2927] best model for learning that is following the example of God putting our anger on hold
[time=2937] as God does to us so we do thank God for his patience we do desire and pray and work at
[time=2947] being patient ourselves now a couple don'ts we need to be sure that we don't misinterpret
[time=2954] God's patience many times because God is a patient God people will look around and they
[time=2960] will think that God is either not here or he's not concerned about what's going on we need
[time=2967] to not misinterpret the patience of God can you flip over to second Peter chapter 3 classic
[time=2975] passage that talks about some people's misunderstanding of God's patience some people assume because
[time=2982] they didn't see God acting according to certain things he said were going to happen then he must not really care or must not really be around but in first and I'm sorry in second Peter chapter 3 we're told that it's because of the patience of God don't misinterpret
[time=2999] the patience of God second Peter chapter 3 beginning at verse 3 first of all Peter writes
[time=3006] you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and following their own evil desires and they will say where is this coming he promised I mean ever since
[time=3017] our fathers died everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation but they
[time=3023] deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of the water and by the water and by these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed people were coming on and saying you know God's you say that God is coming back you say he said that where is he there's no change in the earth time
[time=3043] goes on people live people die it's always the same where is God in this earth has always
[time=3049] been the same well Peter first of all reminds me says no that's not true first of all the earth hasn't always been this way there's a time God did destroy the people of the earth through a flood then he goes on to say starting in verse 7 by the same word the present heavens and the earth are reserved for fire being kept for the day of judgment and destruction
[time=3068] of ungodly men now I'm not anxious for that to happen verse 8 but do not forget this one
[time=3076] thing dear friends with the Lord a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day the Lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness here
[time=3089] it is he is patient he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to
[time=3099] come to repentance if there is a God why isn't he here why isn't he back why isn't he setting
[time=3108] things right why isn't he bringing to judgment those people who deserve to be judged because
[time=3115] of his patience wanting us to be saved to come to repentance God has demonstrated this
[time=3123] kind of patience throughout all his acting in human history and especially as we see his plan of salvation unfolding from the Old Testament to the time of Christ to the church today God has always acted in patience we've always seen that as a characteristic of God
[time=3140] and probably the greatest picture of the patience of God that I can think of is Jesus Christ hanging
[time=3147] on a cross God knew that in ourselves we deserve his judgment and there's nothing that we could
[time=3155] do to match his standard of holiness and perfection one sin makes us worthy of the judgment of
[time=3165] God and we send many more times than that yet because of his love God sent Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for our sin and to die and to suffer and to hang on that cross now as he hung on that cross he did not have to be there there's a hymn that has lines that go
[time=3181] like this he could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free and I believe Jesus could have done it any moment he could have called the angels I'm done come get these come get me from here destroy the world set me free but he didn't
[time=3198] the song goes on he died alone for you and me the patience of God God's anger on hold
[time=3206] it's not misinterpret God's patience thinking that he doesn't care that he's not working
[time=3212] to understand it for what it is and finally another don't don't presume on the patience
[time=3219] of God we should never think God is a God of patience he's a God of love so I can do
[time=3229] what I want and I'm going to get away with it because God's just going to let me keep going and some time later I can come back and you know say I'm sorry and God will say
[time=3239] that's all right we should never presume on the patience God is not obligated to be patient
[time=3245] with us he's not obligated to be patient even with those of us who are his children God doesn't have to exercise patience I mean he does as our father but there are times we see in scripture when God acted even in the life of his people in immediate judgment
[time=3263] I think of Ananias and Sophia in the New Testament they came in they lied about the offering they were giving and they were struck dead now we can be thankful that the God doesn't react that way in our churches today we'd be having morgues underneath you know our sanctuary
[time=3277] if that was the case probably God is patient and yet we should never presume that God is
[time=3283] obligated to be patient with us in the book of Amos the prophet is talking about the
[time=3289] call of God to his people to return to come back to the Lord over and over persistently
[time=3295] calling his people to come back to him and yet in chapter four five times it says you would not return to me God tells his people you would not come back to me and chapter
[time=3307] four verse twelve it says therefore I will do this to you prepare to meet your God and
[time=3314] Matthew we have the picture of Jesus Christ looking out over Jerusalem crying and saying
[time=3321] Jerusalem Jerusalem and in his lament saying how often I would have gathered you to myself
[time=3329] as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you would not therefore he says your
[time=3337] house is left to you desolate we cannot presume on the patience of God we cannot take his
[time=3345] grace for granted there are people in the Bible who presumed on the patience of God the people
[time=3355] of Noah's day his contemporaries presumed that nothing would happen to them that they could live the way they wanted God judged them people of Sodom and Gomorrah presumed on the patience
[time=3366] of God didn't even acknowledge God so we can live our own lifestyle we can do what we want to do and judge what's right and wrong and God judged them mentioned an anisles of fire who presumed on the patience of God we look at the Corinthian church we see a church
[time=3383] of people who seem to just presume that God would let them do what they wanted that he
[time=3389] would not punish them too badly they presumed on the patience of God and because of that
[time=3395] Paul writes many of them slept many of them were killed these are Christians and the
[time=3402] Bible tells me because I am a child of God because he loves me there's time when his patience
[time=3409] when his anger on hold when he will lift the finger up and out of love yet out of justice
[time=3417] sin will be dealt with even in my life in fact the Bible tells me if I am a Christian and I can just go on and do as I please and suffer no consequences for it I need to be concerned whether I really am a legitimate child of God let's not presume on his patience
[time=3436] there's coming a time when God will say the time of patience is done the time of justice
[time=3442] is here he's coming a time when we will face the judgment of God there may come a time in our lives there may be a time right now in your life in an area where you just presume on the patience of God an area where you continue to be disobedience and God is coming to the point when he is ready to lift his finger and he's going to deal with you let's be thankful
[time=3462] for the patience of God and yet be diligent to work in our life in such a way that we don't exercise the patience of God that we are loyal we are obedient we don't doubt we
[time=3478] live for God
