[time=0] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=76] I want to invite you today to join me for a building inspection.
[time=79] You don't even leave your seat because the building we're going to inspect is not one made out of stone or wood or metal.
[time=85] It's a building of people.
[time=87] It's the church. So join me today as we take time for a building inspection.
[time=92] [MUSIC]
[time=102] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=107] Thank you for joining us.
[time=110] Speaking today is our youth pastor, Tim Teder. Tim's message is entitled, "Taking Time for a Building Inspection."
[time=117] His text is taken from the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 3 verses 10 through 15.
[time=124] Special music today includes a solo from Read La Favor and Corrine Sykafruz.
[time=131] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir and orchestra bring us a song entitled, "Sinner Saved by Grace."
[time=139] [MUSIC]
[time=151] If you could see what I once was, if you could go with me back to where I started from,
[time=167] then I know you could see.
[time=173] [MUSIC - 72 seconds]
[time=255] How could I boast of anything I've ever seen and done?
[time=268] How could I dare to claim as mild the victories God has won?
[time=279] Where would I be had God that brought me gently to this place?
[time=290] I'm here to say, I'm nothing but a sin, a saint by grace.
[time=305] [MUSIC - 78 seconds]
[time=409] Amen. A wonderful testimony that God saves those that are at the lowest state of life and gives them new life because of Jesus Christ.
[time=418] Grace greater than all our sin. He loves us greater than anything we could ever do.
[time=423] Him number 201, please, we'll sing verses 1, 2, and 4 together. Him number 201.
[time=431] [MUSIC - 168 seconds]
[time=624] Thank you very much for your good singing. I appreciate that. Today is a special Sunday in the life of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=631] I'd like to have Steve Longbrake come and speak to us for a moment. Steve is the coordinator of our building program for this fall.
[time=640] Thank you, Pete. Perhaps this morning you noticed the banner in the foyer that illustrates for us we have a plan.
[time=647] Blue print for building lives. We need buildings because we have a lot of lives that we want to build.
[time=653] And I hope this morning that you stopped and reflected on that for a moment. If not, I'm asking you to do that right now.
[time=659] We want to emphasize a few things during this building phase of our next program.
[time=664] We are designing the congregation approve that we design a building last June, and we're in the process of designing that next phase that we need.
[time=672] Also, the congregation at that point in June voted that we would begin a fundraising program, and we're kicking that off today.
[time=679] It's an exciting day. Blue print for building lives. I'm thankful that I'm in a place where we need more buildings. We need more rooms.
[time=687] The first thing we need to do during this part of our building program is visit our congregation.
[time=693] We're hoping that half of you will become visitors so that you only have to make one visit.
[time=698] If half of our congregation will be willing to go out and visit, we'll only need to make one visit.
[time=703] We want to do that because we want to inform people about what's happened in our church in the past, what's happening now, and what our plans are for the future.
[time=710] Tonight, after the evening service, if you're interested in being one of those visitors, we'd like for you to stay and receive all the information you would need to share with those folks.
[time=719] Those visits are not going to be a time where you gather money from them. You're presenting them with some information and leaving them the information.
[time=726] Please be willing to be a visitor. We need you. Also, I want to announce to you today that October 21st, we'll have one service here in the sanctuary.
[time=736] We'll meet as one congregation rather than two, and we'll have a great day that time kicking off a two-week prayer vigil.
[time=744] We want to emphasize prayer the last two weeks of our fun drive, and so we're asking you to come whenever you can.
[time=750] Seven o'clock in the morning, and twelve o'clock at noon, this room will be open, and there will be people here praying every day for the next two weeks after October 21st.
[time=759] We're going to have a great celebration that day to emphasize our building needs and our fundraising, but we want to begin the prayer time, too.
[time=766] With our cooperative help, our working together, and God's blessing, we can build this building.
[time=773] The only part that's our responsibility is the part that He asks us to do, the work here. If we do all that we're supposed to do, and we don't get enough funds, we'll just determine that God doesn't want us to build right now.
[time=785] The only thing I'm asking is that every one of us needs to do our share. We can build this building together with God's blessing. We can't build it apart.
[time=793] We need your help. Please be a visitor. Please anticipate October 21st. Get fired up about the fact that we're going to meet together and celebrate this next phase of our construction.
[time=802] And then pray. Pray now and plan to pray every day the last two weeks of October as we finish up our building program.
[time=811] Thank you.
[time=815] Thank you, Steve. We've been talking about the wonderful grace of God. We're going to listen now as Read La Favor comes to saying for us a song entitled "What Grace Is This?"
[time=832] [MUSIC] Down from heaven's palaces [MUSIC] Splendered field and bright came the King [MUSIC] And he came to bring to our world new life and life [MUSIC] What grace is this that brought my Savior down [MUSIC] That made him leave his glorious throne in his crown [MUSIC] The one who made the earth the sky and sea [MUSIC] Who put the stars in every galaxy [MUSIC] What condescension, oh how can it be [MUSIC] What shame he suffered, oh the agony [MUSIC] And in the death he died, for sinners crucified [MUSIC] What grace is this, what grace is this [MUSIC] And what condescension, how can it be [MUSIC] What shame he suffered, oh the agony [MUSIC] And in the death he died, for we sinners crucified [MUSIC] What grace is this, what grace is this â™ª
[time=968] [APPLAUSE]
[time=974] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=977] I hope that you're acclimated to the new fall schedule and that your household is in somewhat of an order again as we begin the fall.
[time=985] This is my very favorite time of the year. The weather is so beautiful.
[time=989] We had a soccer game here yesterday with Black Hawk Christian and we also had a softball tournament.
[time=995] Just some beautiful weather this time of the year in Indiana.
[time=1000] Just this past week we sent a letter to our Founders Club members and those of you that have most recently written into the Bible Hour.
[time=1008] You probably note that we do not ask very often for money for support of the Bible Hour.
[time=1014] It is supported by members and friends of the Founders Club.
[time=1018] And I hope that as you receive this letter this week that you will seriously consider your part in supporting the Bible Hour from week to week.
[time=1027] Also, if you did not receive a letter and you would like to know how to become a Founders Club member,
[time=1033] you can write to us today. I want to give you that telephone number.
[time=1037] It's area code 219 493 7400.
[time=1043] Once again, the area code is 219 493 7400.
[time=1050] When you call, just ask for the Bible Hour office and they will tell you how you can become a member of the Founders Club.
[time=1056] It's a very helpful organization that allows us to continue to minister on the air from week to week.
[time=1063] And we thank all of you that have been so faithful in your giving to that Founders Club ministry.
[time=1069] For the next two weeks our speaker will be Tim Teder.
[time=1072] He's our Associate Pastor here and works with our youth and we're really grateful for his ministry in particular with our youth and their programs from week to week.
[time=1080] Tim, welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=1082] Thank you Pete.
[time=1083] This is somewhat of an unusual Sunday because we are talking specifically about the church and even more particularly to Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1093] We're a campaign as the viewers have already heard Steve Longbreak talk about the campaign of blueprint for building lives.
[time=1099] We're considering whether God would have a smooth ahead in building some more structures as part of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1106] Well, that can building lives and getting ready again with fall kickoff. We've talked so much about these types of things.
[time=1114] This is an ideal time not only to take a look at our church but to look at individual lives and the growth that we need in our spiritual lives.
[time=1121] And today in the sermon I want to take a look at 1 Corinthians 3 where Paul talks about the building of the church.
[time=1127] He's not talking about a physical building but about the people of the church and how we're to examine the church.
[time=1133] And so take a look not only at that church but how are we doing is Blackhawk Baptist Church and our building into lives and our ministry here.
[time=1142] Well Tim, God has really blessed Blackhawk Baptist Church and at this particular time while he's allowing us to grow we really need to be sensitive to our physical needs so we can in particular in this building program to our Christian school
[time=1155] and be prepared to accommodate those young people that want to come and be a part of our school.
[time=1161] So, thank you for speaking to that issue today and we look forward to not only today but please tune in and be with us next week.
[time=1169] Tim Teder will be speaking to us.
[time=1172] We have a library of booklets and books that we've offered in the Bible Hour and our assistant here on the Bible Hour that works with the mailing is Carolyn Dick.
[time=1183] Last week we just went through those booklets and books and I asked Carolyn what were some of the books that were most often asked for.
[time=1192] One of the most recent booklets that we offered was a booklet entitled Getting Through Depression.
[time=1198] This is a difficult time and this day and age people are lonely.
[time=1202] They need help and they need encouragement and while the church can be a great source and while Christians are supposed to have joy in their lives it's not unusual for us.
[time=1211] As mentioned even in First Peter that we are going to go through trials and temptations in our lives.
[time=1218] This little booklet written by Charles M. Sell is just a great source of hope and encouragement.
[time=1224] So, if you need some help and encouragement today why don't you write for this booklet.
[time=1229] Once again it's entitled Getting Through Depression and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour,
[time=1236] 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1244] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1253] Again I hope as you receive the letter this week that you will consider being a member of our Founders Club and helping us with the support of the Bible Hour.
[time=1261] And if you'd like to receive that booklet just write us today. We look forward to your letter this week.
[time=1266] We'll go back to the live portion of our service now and may God bless us as we continue together Worshiping the Lord.
[time=1285] Someone to go the extra mile just like a mother hearing for her child.
[time=1300] A friend who sticks through thick and thin.
[time=1308] No matter what you talk or where you bring.
[time=1316] Just like one great big family.
[time=1323] A stronger older brother he will be.
[time=1331] So quick and ready to defend.
[time=1339] The young we put to the end.
[time=1347] And he's ever interceded to the Father for his children.
[time=1377] Through him you can reach the Father.
[time=1385] So bring him all your heavy blood.
[time=1392] Yes for you he's interceded.
[time=1400] So come boldly to the Lord.
[time=1415] Just like sheep breed gone astray.
[time=1422] Struggling near the debt we could not fail.
[time=1430] Not ever hoping to renew.
[time=1437] The love and fellowship that we once knew.
[time=1445] But he began to intercede.
[time=1453] Rying Father please forgive me by running.
[time=1460] And as the nails pierced in his hands.
[time=1467] One once again reached out to him.
[time=1475] And he's ever interceded to the Father for his children.
[time=1506] Through him you can reach the Father.
[time=1514] So bring him all your heavy blood.
[time=1523] Yes for you he's interceded.
[time=1546] So come boldly to the Master of God.
[time=1569] What an amazing thing the intercession of Jesus Christ.
[time=1572] Because of him we can approach boldly the throne of God.
[time=1577] And talk to him.
[time=1579] So we pray now I'd like us to remember one of the missionaries we support.
[time=1583] Karen Elliot in Africa.
[time=1585] Tomorrow she'll be going in for some exploratory surgery to examine a uterine growth.
[time=1591] To see if it's something they need to be concerned about.
[time=1593] Let's remember that as we go to God in prayer.
[time=1597] God it is a privilege that we thank you for, that you allow us to speak to you.
[time=1603] The awesome Creator.
[time=1605] We thank you for Jesus Christ who stands on our behalf.
[time=1609] Our intercessor.
[time=1611] Our mediator.
[time=1613] So that in confidence we can pray to you.
[time=1616] And we come with this request now of Karen.
[time=1619] We pray for her and her husband.
[time=1621] Tomorrow especially is they face tests.
[time=1624] We ask that you bring healing.
[time=1626] And we ask Father the two as you meet with us here this morning.
[time=1630] That your word reigns supreme in our lives.
[time=1634] We ask these things through Christ's authority.
[time=1638] And because we believe it's what pleases him.
[time=1641] [AMEN] Blueprint for building lives.
[time=1648] That theme suggests that we at Blackhawk Baptist Church are concerned with more than just
[time=1655] the structural building.
[time=1659] It means that we're not just interested in building buildings but those are a means
[time=1665] to an end to affect lives.
[time=1669] And I want to invite you today to come along with me as we go on a building inspection.
[time=1675] And I want to look at Paul's pattern for inspecting the building of the church.
[time=1682] In 1 Corinthians 3 if you have your bio lecture to turn to that chapter.
[time=1686] 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
[time=1688] And Paul in writing to the group of believers in Corinth talks about a building and talks
[time=1697] about their need to inspect the work of their building.
[time=1701] And we want today to look at what he says to say to them and see what we can learn concerning our building and how God sees us.
[time=1710] 1 Corinthians chapter 3 I'm going to begin reading verse 10.
[time=1714] Paul writes, "By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder
[time=1720] and someone else is building on it.
[time=1722] But each one should be careful how he builds.
[time=1725] For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[time=1731] If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,
[time=1738] his work will be shown for what it is because the day will bring it to light.
[time=1742] It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.
[time=1748] If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.
[time=1752] If it is burned up, he will suffer loss.
[time=1755] He himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames."
[time=1762] Paul in this passage talks about a number of things that we want to examine today.
[time=1767] He talks about a building, he talks about an expert builder, talks about foundation, talks about workers and the material that they use to build.
[time=1776] He talks about a final inspection.
[time=1779] What does he mean by these terms?
[time=1781] What is the building that Paul refers to when he's writing this letter?
[time=1787] We need to understand the context that this passage comes from.
[time=1791] Paul is writing a letter to a local church.
[time=1794] He's writing a letter to a group of Christians who have gathered in the city of Corinth.
[time=1799] We see that as he addresses the people in chapter 1, verse 2.
[time=1802] He says to the church of God in Corinth, specifically that's who he's writing about.
[time=1807] If you know anything about the church of Corinth, you know that they had a number of problems, one of which was the problem of disunity.
[time=1813] The people of Corinth were gathering themselves around different personalities and were arguing over who was the best leader to follow.
[time=1822] Some were saying, "I follow Paul." Others were saying, "Well, I follow Paul." Still others were saying, "Well, I follow Peter, Cephas." And then others were standing back and saying, "Well, we follow Jesus Christ himself." And it was a matter of pride and divisiveness.
[time=1837] And Paul addresses that issue as he writes this church and uses, in chapter 3, first of all he uses the metaphor of a garden or field to illustrate the church.
[time=1848] And as you read his description of the field in the first part of the third chapter, we see that he is referring to the local church as a garden or a field.
[time=1859] And Paul says, "You are the field, and I am just the servant who has come to plant the seed." That's all on the hired hand, is come and planted the seed of God's Word in your lives, into the field.
[time=1869] And Paul says one, and others who have come along, who have come along and perhaps watered that seed and cultivated the soil.
[time=1875] But the point is that the field is God's, and he is the one that causes growth.
[time=1880] Don't align yourself behind personalities because God is the one who is important here, not us.
[time=1887] And then he goes on to make another illustration through the metaphor of a building, as we have just read.
[time=1892] And he says that you, the local church, are like a building.
[time=1897] Now, what Paul is talking about when he talks about the building is not the physical structure of a church building.
[time=1907] We get preoccupied with the physical structure of the church.
[time=1912] Let me do a little test.
[time=1914] I'm going to throw out a phrase, and you think about what comes to your mind when I throw this phrase out.
[time=1920] Going to church.
[time=1922] Now what's the first thing that comes to your mind?
[time=1924] For some of you, you think of maybe this morning, or a typical Sunday morning, when you're running around fighting for the bathroom, trying to throw things together, get something shoved down to eat and cramming in the car, coming to church,
[time=1937] putting on a happy face as you step out to go to your Sunday school or church service.
[time=1944] For other of you, perhaps you had the vision of a church building like ours or another church, as people walked in, and then when you think of going to church, we tend to think of things that are surrounding the place, the organization.
[time=1956] When really the Bible, when it talks about the church, it's talking about people.
[time=1960] And that's what Paul, when you talk about the building, he's talking about people.
[time=1964] When he talks about the building, he's talking about those individual Christians who make up the assembly of the church.
[time=1972] When we talk about the house of God, we often refer to the physical structure of things, don't we?
[time=1979] We refer to this building or whatever sanctuary we meet him as the house of God.
[time=1987] This is not the house of God.
[time=1989] This physical structure is not the house of God.
[time=1993] The Bible tells us that we are the houses of God.
[time=1997] Chapter 6 says that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2000] In chapter 3 here, as you get on, and you see in verses 16 and 17, Paul addresses the church that says you yourselves are the temple of God.
[time=2009] The church is the house of God.
[time=2012] That is where God's spirit dwells in lives, not in buildings.
[time=2015] In the Old Testament time, they had the tabernacle in the temple.
[time=2018] And that is where the presence of God dwelt in a very unique and special way.
[time=2022] But when Christ came, when Christ fulfilled the law, the veil was ripped in two, and God no longer dwells in that same sense in a presence in a building.
[time=2031] He dwells in our life, so this is not the house of God.
[time=2034] This is the place where the houses of God come to worship and meet.
[time=2038] We emphasize structure.
[time=2040] Paul emphasizes people here when he talks about building.
[time=2044] We need to be careful.
[time=2046] When he talks about the building, he's not talking about the individual Christian.
[time=2051] He uses the plural "you" when he says "you are God's building." He says in verse 16, "You yourselves are the temple of God." If we look at this passage as some have done, the building represents the individual Christian life
[time=2067] and the things that you're building into the individual Christian life.
[time=2070] It can lead us to a really wrong doctrine, especially as we look in verses 14 and 15.
[time=2074] What Paul is addressing here is the local church.
[time=2077] Specifically here, the church of Corinth.
[time=2080] And that shows itself again when he addresses them as "you are God's building."
[time=2086] He wasn't talking about the physical structure.
[time=2088] The Christians through time have met in many different places.
[time=2092] They've met in tombs.
[time=2096] They've met in houses.
[time=2097] They've met in theaters.
[time=2099] They've met in buildings like ours that we build for meeting together.
[time=2103] And those things may belong to a bank or to an individual or to the congregation,
[time=2109] but when Paul is addressing the church, the people, he says, "You are God's people.
[time=2112] You are God's church.
[time=2113] You are God's building." So that's what he's talking about.
[time=2116] Paul describes himself as the expert builder.
[time=2119] Or I like what the King James says here, the master builder.
[time=2123] And the Greek word that is translated, expert or master builder, is the word that we get our English word architect from.
[time=2131] And in Paul's days, the architect wasn't just the planner.
[time=2134] It was the person that would not only plan, but oversee the construction of a building.
[time=2139] And Paul says, "I was the master builder." He doesn't say it in a proud sense.
[time=2145] He's very quick to say because of the grace God has given me.
[time=2149] I was the one that came in knowing the plan of God for a church and overseeing the laying of its foundation.
[time=2157] I was the master builder.
[time=2160] We can, if you keep your finger in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and turn back to Acts chapter 18,
[time=2167] we get a little historical background of Paul, the master building,
[time=2173] the church and Corinth.
[time=2177] Acts chapter 18 says, "After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth."
[time=2183] Look in verse 4, it says, "Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue trying to persuade Jews and Greeks."
[time=2190] Then when Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia to join him, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
[time=2199] And we go on to read historically how Paul was the one who came in to establish and build the church in Corinth.
[time=2205] First of all, teaching through the synagogue to the Jews and then being rejected by most of the Jews
[time=2211] to move out next door and begin preaching to anyone who would listen the truth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2216] And he came in, began the building, began establishing the church as the master builder.
[time=2221] And he laid the foundation.
[time=2223] And we see in Acts chapter 18 verse 5, it says that Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
[time=2235] That's consistent with what he writes to the Corinthians in chapter 3 verses 10 and 11.
[time=2240] He says, "I laid a foundation as an expert builder.
[time=2243] No one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[time=2249] Jesus Christ is the foundation.
[time=2252] Now, when we say that Jesus is the foundation, and I'm sure what Paul was preaching, when he preached to the people that Jesus is the Christ, that Jesus is the Messiah, it wasn't a foundation of, "Oh, just believe that Jesus was here." Or, "Just believe that Jesus was a good guy that we should kind of emulate and follow in our lives." It was believed that Jesus is the Christ.
[time=2272] Believe that all that has been prophesied and taught concerning God in our lives and the Old Testament is pointing towards Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ is the Messiah that is foretold in the Old Testament.
[time=2287] It's the whole person, the whole teaching of Jesus is the foundation of the church.
[time=2291] And it is the only acceptable foundation for God's building.
[time=2297] Now, if that's true, then we have to say this and listen.
[time=2301] Any church with Christ as its foundation is a true church.
[time=2313] That was a relief to my neighbor who up until this past week had thought that
[time=2319] black, hot Baptist church believed that unless you were a Baptist, you weren't going to heaven.
[time=2325] She thought, "That's what we taught. I don't think our church has ever taught that.
[time=2328] I hope it never will because denominations are simply labels that we put on churches and groups
[time=2335] that help characterize the uniqueness of particular building, but they're all built on the same foundation.
[time=2343] They should all be built on Jesus Christ.
[time=2346] That should be what characterizes us first and most of all, that we are Christians.
[time=2351] How do you respond when you get into discussions of religion and someone asks you, "Well, what are you?" I'm a Christian.
[time=2359] First of all, I'm a Christian.
[time=2361] That's the most important thing.
[time=2363] I hesitate saying I'm a Baptist, but a lot of people, especially if I don't know them, because people have weird ideas of what Baptists are.
[time=2370] You know that.
[time=2371] You probably figure that out with some of the people you've talked to.
[time=2374] That's not the most important thing.
[time=2376] I'm a Methodist.
[time=2377] I'm a Catholic.
[time=2378] I'm a Baptist.
[time=2379] I'm a Calvinist.
[time=2380] I'm Pentecostal.
[time=2381] I'm charismatic.
[time=2382] All those are labels that describe something, but they don't mean anything unless our foundation is Jesus Christ.
[time=2388] If our foundation is Jesus Christ, then that church is a true church.
[time=2392] If your foundation isn't Jesus Christ, it doesn't matter if you're a Baptist or anything else.
[time=2396] You are not a church.
[time=2399] Our foundation, Jesus Christ.
[time=2402] You know a church with any other foundation is not a true church.
[time=2405] If a church is founded on tradition, it's not a true church.
[time=2409] If a church is founded first of all on issues, it is not a true church.
[time=2418] If a church is founded on personalities, many churches are.
[time=2423] I can give you examples of churches that grew in great numbers to thousands, but it was founded on a personality and once a person left, church is now down to 200 and 100 dying because they were founded on a person not on Jesus Christ.
[time=2440] Paul goes on to talk about the workers and specifically what he's talking about in this passage are the leaders and the teachers of this local church in Corinth,
[time=2451] the pastors and teachers of their church.
[time=2454] But as we read the passage, it becomes, obviously, he has something broader in mind too because it seems he refers to all the Christians there that are part of the church
[time=2462] and their responsibility in building into the structure of the church.
[time=2465] So generally speaking, we can say that the workers here refer to the leaders, the pastors, the teachers,
[time=2472] but also to all those who are part of the church and invest and contribute to it.
[time=2476] Those are the workers and what do they use to build? He talks about the materials and it's a question of quality.
[time=2482] You see the list here, he says some of you are building with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, straw.
[time=2491] There's really two groups he's referring to there.
[time=2494] The gold, silver, costly stones, that's a quality that is valuable.
[time=2499] Those are things that are not so easily obtained. Sometimes you have to sacrifice to get those.
[time=2504] Those are things that will last. They're permanent.
[time=2508] In contrast, the wood, the hay, the straw, those are things that are easily obtained.
[time=2515] They're not necessarily bad, but the things that don't demand a lot of sacrifice.
[time=2519] There are things that are cheaper. They're not quite as valuable.
[time=2522] There are things that are temporary. They don't really last.
[time=2524] And Paul's emphasis is, "Hey, you give attention to building with the things that are permanent, the things that are valuable, the things that are going to stand the test of God's inspection one day."
[time=2535] I think there are probably a number of things that we could say would characterize quality material in the church.
[time=2542] Let me just mention three that I think are important if we're going to have quality material.
[time=2547] I think these three things have to be true.
[time=2550] We have to have obedient service, pure motives, sound doctrine,
[time=2556] obedient service, pure motives, and sound doctrine. And they all go together.
[time=2560] It has to be obedient service that comes out of a pure motive that is based on sound doctrine.
[time=2568] If you lose any one of those, you have cheap material.
[time=2571] You may have sound doctrine, and you may have right motives, but unless it results in obedient service, it means nothing.
[time=2579] On the other hand, you may have sound doctrine, and you may have obedient service.
[time=2585] You may be doing the right thing, and we're being taught the right thing. It's based on sound doctrine, but if your motives are wrong in doing it,
[time=2592] if your motives are for self-gratification, or if your motives are selfish in any way, or your motives are kind of a weary, drudgery.
[time=2602] Well, I guess I have to do it. It doesn't mean anything.
[time=2608] You may have pure motives and obedient service, but unless your obedience is based on sound doctrine, it's cheap.
[time=2614] If you're being obedient to doctrine and it's unsound, it really does not count.
[time=2623] We need to have all three.
[time=2625] Paul talks to the church in Corinth saying there's going to come a day when you will face a final inspection.
[time=2633] It's going to come a day when God himself inspects your church.
[time=2638] He talks about the fire of God's judgment.
[time=2641] You've ever seen a house that has been swept through with fire, and the fire has just been allowed to have its way in the home?
[time=2649] You come to the aftermath of the burned building, and you look, and what's left?
[time=2653] I've seen many buildings that pretty much all you see is the chimney and twisted pieces of metal and brick and stone that were left there.
[time=2664] You know what's left? Only the things that the fire couldn't consume.
[time=2669] Paul says when the church of Corinth stands before God's inspection, his fire will sweep through and it will consume everything that is of no value.
[time=2677] The only things left will be those things that are permanent, those things that have value.
[time=2685] Perhaps this is why in James 3-1 we have the caution given that not many should presume to be teachers in the church.
[time=2695] I think God looks seriously at what we're investing in the church.
[time=2703] God is more concerned with the quality of our work than the quantity.
[time=2708] We may be busy doing a lot of things, but what God will test is the quality of our work.
[time=2714] We need to understand that poor material is an offense to God.
[time=2718] That's what Paul is saying when he says there will come the day when you're building your work.
[time=2724] The material you've invested in your church will be tested.
[time=2730] Let's personalize this a little bit.
[time=2733] Let's go through an inspection of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2738] We do that.
[time=2740] We're not talking about the building, again we're talking about the people, the ministry in people's lives, the building into lives of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2750] It's not always an easier, comfortable thing for us to do.
[time=2754] We'd rather be admired than inspected.
[time=2757] When you go into someone's home, you admire their home.
[time=2761] That's what they want.
[time=2762] You go in and say, "Oh, what a lovely furnishings.
[time=2764] Oh, I like what you've done to the den here." The pattern in your kitchens, that's just beautiful.
[time=2770] We like people to do that.
[time=2772] People don't take it so well when you come in and you walk in the house in the living room.
[time=2776] Color's all wrong.
[time=2777] Nope, I wouldn't have done it.
[time=2779] Joints, not quite square there.
[time=2781] Oh, this kitchen.
[time=2782] I can't believe the way it's laid out.
[time=2783] It could be a lot more efficient if you would have just...
[time=2787] People wouldn't take it too kindly.
[time=2788] We don't like to be inspected that closely.
[time=2791] I know when I was selling our home in Michigan before we moved down to Fort Wayne and people would come to our home.
[time=2796] I was hoping they'd come at night, you know, because things are a little darker.
[time=2800] They couldn't inspect quite so well.
[time=2802] Inspection is uncomfortable, but we need to do it.
[time=2807] How does our church match the inspection?
[time=2814] How we come out when we're inspected?
[time=2817] Let's look at our foundation.
[time=2818] What is the foundation of Black Hawk Baptist Church?
[time=2822] The foundation of our church should be Jesus Christ, is it?
[time=2829] Well, the foundation of our church is not a cause.
[time=2834] I don't think our church was founded on a cause.
[time=2837] There are good causes.
[time=2839] There are good reasons for Christians to be motivated and work together for a particular cause.
[time=2843] But causes come and go.
[time=2845] Even good causes.
[time=2846] Our church wasn't founded on a cause.
[time=2851] We have good programs.
[time=2853] We strive for excellence in our programs to the glory of God.
[time=2856] There's nothing wrong with that.
[time=2857] But, you know, what programs change?
[time=2859] Styles change.
[time=2862] Jesus Christ doesn't change.
[time=2865] Our church wasn't founded on a creed.
[time=2868] Now, we have a statement of belief.
[time=2871] It helps identify the uniqueness of our church.
[time=2874] But we are founded on something different than a creed.
[time=2878] And neither are we founded on a personality, on a person.
[time=2882] In the 1960s, God gave vision to a church in Fort Wayne, to a manual Baptist church, to expand the ministry.
[time=2894] And one of the results of that vision, God gave a manual Baptist church, was the beginning of what is now Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2901] And 21 years ago, on September 7th of 1969, seven families, the leadership of David Jeremiah,
[time=2909] met across the street in a little double-wide trailer that was their church structure.
[time=2917] And David Jeremiah led the building.
[time=2921] He was perhaps one of the master builders, along with those seven families, in building what is now Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2928] But, in time, in 1981, Pastor Jeremiah left, to continue ministry in California.
[time=2939] And there were people at the time, I'm sure, who thought, "Well, the church won't survive this change."
[time=2945] But it did.
[time=2947] Because the church wasn't founded on David Jeremiah.
[time=2950] The church was founded on Jesus Christ.
[time=2952] In 1983, Pastor Rick Hawks became pastor of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2956] And he continued in the building.
[time=2958] And what we so much enjoy is the ministry of this church.
[time=2961] Much of it carries the personality and the leadership of Rick Hawks.
[time=2966] And earlier this year, Rick Hawks left.
[time=2968] You know what? Our church isn't going to die.
[time=2971] Because our foundation is Jesus Christ.
[time=2974] Our foundation is not any particular person or persons.
[time=2979] Pastors of this church will come and go.
[time=2981] The leaders and teachers of this church will come and go.
[time=2985] But this church will remain as long as we continue to realize and build on the foundation of Jesus Christ.
[time=2992] That is what is most important.
[time=2996] We have so much to be thankful for.
[time=3000] To be thankful to God of what He has done in the ministry of our church.
[time=3005] And I think it can be true as we look through the history of Black Hawk, that we have been attempting to follow a blueprint that builds lives.
[time=3014] Not following a blueprint that makes us look good, that gets the most, the fanciest structure in our city or in our area.
[time=3022] That hasn't been our intent.
[time=3024] Our intent has been to follow a pattern that affect life for Jesus Christ.
[time=3029] And we have so much that we can be thankful for as a church.
[time=3032] You as a church can be thankful that you have the kind of people.
[time=3037] And I don't say this to my glorification in any way.
[time=3042] I came to this church two and a half years ago and one thing that attracted me to this church is the staff that was already here.
[time=3047] And there's a uniqueness about the staff that serves at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3051] Not only did they do well in the areas that they were responsible for, but they got along with one another.
[time=3057] Do you know how many churches have staff that really don't even get along that well together, don't enjoy being together?
[time=3063] I enjoy being with the people that serve as the staff of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3068] We have people in areas of teaching and leadership and volunteering for certain things that carry on a ministry that we have so much to be proud and thankful for.
[time=3079] I'm not proud of ourselves, but proud that we can say that by the grace of God he is building lives through Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3089] But how do we stand when we measure the material of our building?
[time=3096] If we go on an inspection of Black Hawk Baptist Church, what kind of materials do we find?
[time=3102] Honestly, now, do you know in the building, and we're talking of the people of Black Hawk Baptist Church, do you know in the building we will find gold, silver, precious stones?
[time=3116] We will also find the wood, hay, and the straw because every church is going to have mixed materials.
[time=3122] There is no perfect church existing on the earth today.
[time=3126] Now, what we want, what we want is to invest in those things that are the precious, the valuable, but we recognize that at times things that there are materials that really aren't going to stand the test.
[time=3137] I can tell you in full confidence that in the ministry of this church we do have those materials that will stand the test.
[time=3144] We do have those materials, invest in our church that are valuable, that are right and are good.
[time=3148] We do have the teachers who not only love God, but work to invest his truth in the lives of other people.
[time=3154] We have volunteers who, out of a sense of wanting to see God's work accomplished, give their time and resources to see that done.
[time=3162] We have, as part of our ministry, a Christian school that not only has a standard of academic excellence, but along with that, a desire to see these things taught from a perspective of God's view, and they do it well.
[time=3179] And what we also have students that are in public schools that are affecting their campuses and friends with the message of Jesus Christ.
[time=3188] And these are just some of the examples of the kinds of materials that are going to stand the test of time.
[time=3196] We can be thankful for that.
[time=3198] And if you're one of those workers that is investing these kinds of materials in our church, I'm sure you don't get enough praise.
[time=3205] I'm sure you don't get enough of the recognition that you really deserve, but you know what, the time is going to come when God is going to recognize that better than we're able to do.
[time=3215] But I also know that in a church like ours, there comes the danger of having material that won't last.
[time=3223] Materials that will not pass the inspection.
[time=3226] And instead of being specific, let me just give you some general things that I would be concerned about with the church, like the personality of Blackhawk Baptist Church, a church with the size of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=3238] What are some of the things that we should be concerned about?
[time=3240] Careful that we don't build into it.
[time=3244] Material that is temporary, that is cheap, might be characterized by these things.
[time=3254] Might be work that focuses on maintaining an image.
[time=3258] We have an image, Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=3260] You know, I think for the most part, for a great part in our area, in our city, Blackhawk Baptist Church has a reputation that is very positive and very good.
[time=3272] And that's nothing to be ashamed of, certainly.
[time=3274] But when our concern focuses on maintaining that image on how we look to the people on the outside, and our focus begins to be on that rather than on maintaining the purity of doctrine and maintaining the purity of motive and maintaining purity of obedient action, then our work becomes cheap.
[time=3299] God will take care of the image. You know, there may come a time when we aren't in favor of the community.
[time=3304] And I hope if that comes, it will be because of not our disobedience or lack of love and concern.
[time=3310] I hope if that ever comes, it will be because we stand for the truth and for whatever reason, in that time and circumstance, people don't like that.
[time=3317] I hope that will be the reason.
[time=3319] But the image shouldn't be our focus.
[time=3321] Cheap material will come when out of work that gives people what they want instead of what they need.
[time=3327] Now, I hope that that's the same thing in most cases, that people want what they need, but it's not true in all the cases.
[time=3333] And in a church, the size of ours begins attracting people in who are curious, and we want people to be welcome, who are searching, who want to know more.
[time=3341] But what happens many times is people come in, they're attracted by the program, perhaps they're attracted by the preaching or the music or some specific thing that they like.
[time=3350] And we get all the numbers in, and then we think, well, how do we keep all these people here?
[time=3354] We better keep all the programs going, we better keep pleasing all the people, give them what they want, you know.
[time=3359] Make sure that in your preaching or in your speaking or in your music you don't offend.
[time=3363] We need to make sure that our priorities in teaching sound doctrine and presenting Jesus Christ and glorifying God and not have the pride of pleasing people.
[time=3374] Our work will also suffer if we focus on ministry more than the master.
[time=3378] And I speak from personal experience here, I have a responsibility in the area of junior and senior hires, and it's so easy for me to say, we do what we do in our youth program because we want to give God the glory, that's our goal to do that first of all.
[time=3392] And that is true, and yet I have to admit that many times the focus of my attention gets more on the program, the ministry, than on that goal of who God is and bringing people to Him.
[time=3404] And I react at the success of our program whether people come to it or whether they liked it, you know, or whether we had big numbers.
[time=3412] I look at that as my measure of success, when really the measure of my program and of our church should be, are we focusing people's attention on God?
[time=3420] Are we drawing them closer to Jesus Christ?
[time=3424] We need to continue to do that.
[time=3428] Otherwise, our work burns away. It's easy to criticize the church, but the important question for each of us, the most important question, is what are we doing to invest in the work of the church?
[time=3444] What are you doing personally to invest in God's building? Are you investing with material that will last?
[time=3454] Are you investing with material that will be burned away when it faces the inspection of God?
[time=3462] Let us be people who build with a certainty of what is valuable.
[time=3484] We've come to the close of another Bible hour telecast, and it's been our privilege to share with you the message of music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and soloist, Karine Sykafus and Reed LeFavor.
