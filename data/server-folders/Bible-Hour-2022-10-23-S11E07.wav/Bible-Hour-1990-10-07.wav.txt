[time=60] Do you remember that little song we used to sing as children? This little light of mine? I'm going to let it shine?
[time=77] Well, according to the Lord Jesus, we are all the lights of the world, and we're to shine that light in the world.
[time=83] Join us today as we explore what the Apostle Paul meant when he told the Philippians, shine as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
