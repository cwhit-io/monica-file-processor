[time=60] - A few years back, the wire services carried a story about a woman who was brutally murdered
[time=82] on her way home from work in New York City.
[time=85] It was not that murders are unusual in New York that caused the story to be picked up by the wire service.
[time=90] It was because the police report read that over 38 people had heard the woman scream.
[time=96] Over 38 people had heard what needed to be done to call the police to save the woman, but no one had done it.
[time=104] This story tragically illustrates something about our society today.
[time=108] We often hear or see what needs to be done, but we don't take action.
[time=112] James spoke about that in his letter to the early church.
[time=115] He wrote that believers are not just to be heroes of the word, but doers of the word.
[time=120] He went so far as to say that if we are not doers of the word, then our Christian faith is dead.
[time=126] This morning, are you not only a hearer, but also a doer of the word?
[time=130] If not, then your faith in the words of James is a dead faith.
[time=135] (dramatic music)
[time=144] - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=150] Thank you for joining us.
[time=151] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=155] Jim's message is entitled "Blueprints for Conquering Kingdoms." And his text is taken from the book of James chapter one versus 19 through 27.
[time=165] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=170] Special music today includes an instrumental solo from Gary Kans, and a song from the Black Hawk Christian School Girls Ensemble.
[time=179] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled, "What Music I Hear In Your Name." (upbeat music)
[time=203] [MUSIC - 243 seconds]
[time=455] Jesus is mine. Your peace and your power. Jesus is mine. Jesus is mine. Jesus is mine.
[time=482] Jesus is mine. Jesus is mine. My Lord. My Lord. My Lord.
[time=511] Thank you, Susan and Choir. Let's continue our singing by turning to Him number 106.
[time=524] Number 106, praise Him, praise Him. Jesus our Blessed Redeemer.
[time=541] Praise Him, praise Him. Jesus our Blessed Redeemer. Sing over His wonderful love for Him.
[time=552] Hail Him, hail Him. My Lord, thank You, so glory.
[time=557] Drink their order into His holy name. I now share them, Jesus who are His children.
[time=569] In His arms, He carries them all with all. Praise Him, praise Him. Tell Him, He says,
[time=578] praise Him, praise Him, praise Him. Praise Him, praise Him. Jesus our Blessed Redeemer.
[time=593] For our sins in suffering, let it die. Be our love of the winners of salvation.
[time=604] Hail Him, hail Him. Jesus our first divine. Some His praises. Jesus our sorrows.
[time=615] God, our mountain, what it will take us strong. Praise Him, praise Him. Tell Him, He says,
[time=625] bring us. Praise Him, praise Him. Heaven, join us all. Praise Him, praise Him. Jesus our Blessed Redeemer.
[time=639] Hail Him, praise Him, praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him, praise Him.
[time=656] Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him. Praise Him.
[time=683] Very pleased this morning to have Gary Kans come and play force on his trumpet. Gary's a faithful servant with the orchestra every month and we're privileged to have him play for us today.
[time=721] [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=953] Good morning and welcome again to the Bible Hour. You may have already noticed that your usual
[time=961] host for the Bible Hour, Pete Coby, is not here this morning. Pete has been working very hard and is taking a very well-deserved Sunday morning off. But joining me this morning on the Bible Hour is my wife Linda. Linda not only is my wife and my support here in the church and the work that I do, but she is also the Director of Children's Ministries here at Blackhawk. Linda, good morning. Good morning, Jim. Linda Children's Ministries is much more than just Sunday School.
[time=986] We know that there are many programs here at Blackhawk. What's going on right this very moment for children here at Blackhawk? On Sunday mornings, Jim, we have a double hour format, which means basically the kids get three hours of instruction on a Sunday morning. For one of the hours, the very first one, we call that traditionally just Sunday School. And it's very traditional and it's methods and it's approach. And we just have excellent teachers that teach that hour. Then following the second session is Children's Church. And that's done because children have a lot of energy and have a lot of activity that they need to use up during a given morning. So that hour is just traditionally used for more activities and more games and more singing. So together, they get a really nice program on a Sunday morning here.
[time=1027] I'm really proud of the Sunday School teachers that we have here. Week after week, we have over 100 people that serve the children in our church. Well, we certainly are proud of our Children's Ministries here at Blackhawk. Linda, but I know that Sunday morning is not where it all ends. The kids come back on Sunday night and there's something for them again there too, isn't there? On Sunday evenings, we have something we wouldn't want to leave out and that's called Children's Quires. Music is just such a beautiful way of being able to teach biblical truths to children. And our music department here under Pete Kobe offers Children's Quires on Sunday night. And once again, they get an opportunity to learn biblical truths, but through a different medium this time through music.
[time=1062] And then, Linda, there's one more time when the children come. On Wednesday night, they're here for something called Awana. What's Awana? Well, I wish I had known that a year ago when we started Awana. Awana is just our midweek program that we have for children.
[time=1074] Right now, we're averaging pretty close to 300 children on a Wednesday night.
[time=1078] It's a real exciting program. You and I were in Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts when we were children.
[time=1082] And Awana is really based along that type of a format.
[time=1086] The children earn badges and earn uniforms and they're here for about an hour and a half and it's just action packed. They have a devotional time each week. They have a time when they do games. They have a time when they are together and do like a handbook type of time where they're earning badges and that. Again, we have over 100 people that work on Wednesday night with the children. So the Children's Department at this church is really fully staffed and equipped and I'm proud of the programs that we offer children here.
[time=1109] Well, we certainly are proud of the programs. Linda, thank you for being with us this morning here on the Bible Hour. Well, we want to tell you about at least one thing coming up in the life of our church that's important. On October the 21st, on Sunday evening, we will have exaltation.
[time=1125] Exaltation will be a combined Black Hawk Choir with another choir from a church in Anderson, Indiana. They're going to combine for a concert. We're looking forward to that. Also, on October 21st, if you're planning on coming to Black Hawk, we want to remind you that we will be in a one-service format on that day and that day we will begin at 10.30.
[time=1146] We'll be in a one-service format so that everyone can join together as we get an update on our Capitol Funds Drive blueprint for building lives. We're looking forward to hearing about the new and exciting things that are going on here at Black Hawk. Well, we have something for you that we'd like to offer you this week on the Bible Hour. It's called what the Bible says about Jesus Christ.
[time=1168] You know, it's very important what we believe about the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1173] Most people, if you would ask them, do you believe in Jesus Christ? They would say, "Oh, yes, we do very much." But the fact of the matter is we must know exactly what it is that we believe about Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was the Son of God.
[time=1187] He was equal to God in every sense of the Word. He is deity. He is the Son of God, the mighty King for all the ages. We'd like to send you this booklet.
[time=1197] We think that you would enjoy having it. It's written by a great pastor by the name of David Hawking. You can receive this booklet if you would just write to us at the Bible Hour. The address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard,
[time=1212] Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Well, we're glad again that you're
[time=1219] with us this morning. We're looking forward to the remainder of the time.
[time=1223] In just a few moments, I'll be bringing the morning message. But before that, let's go back to our morning worship service in the ministry of Kevin Rowe and one of the high school girls in Samples.
[time=1249] As a ruler in his dreams, his brother sold him as a slave, never more to be seen.
[time=1256] They could not understand he'd rule in each other plan.
[time=1261] And in the time of famine, he'd save them all by his hand.
[time=1266] What we meant for evil, God meant for good.
[time=1271] Doesn't Joseph find the understood? And so with us now, the things that God allows.
[time=1281] We turn into our triumph somehow.
[time=1286] Somehow, 'cause we're always triumphant.
[time=1291] Always victorious, so the storms of life they say that hope is gone.
[time=1298] Always triumphant, always victorious when our faith is anchored to the cornerstone.
[time=1308] And even in the final days of our last breath, we'll receive eternal life that covers death.
[time=1318] 'Cause we're always triumphant, always victorious.
[time=1324] Thanks be to God who causes us to triumph.
[time=1329] Jesus came to earth to destroy the work of sin.
[time=1339] When soldiers nailed him to the cross, the people would win.
[time=1344] Satan did not know, he'd been dealt a deadly blow.
[time=1349] For in the end the Christ would rise again.
[time=1354] What they did in hatred, God's love forgave.
[time=1359] And through what seemed to loss our souls were saved.
[time=1364] So with us now, the things that God allows.
[time=1369] We'll turn into our triumph somehow.
[time=1374] Somehow, 'cause we're always triumphant.
[time=1379] Always victorious, so the storms of life they say that hope is gone.
[time=1386] Always triumphant, always victorious.
[time=1392] Always triumphant, always victorious, the storms of life they say that hope is gone.
[time=1402] Always triumphant, always victorious when our faith is anchored to the cornerstone.
[time=1412] And even in the final days of our last breath, we'll receive eternal life that covers death.
[time=1422] 'Cause we're always triumphant, always victorious.
[time=1429] Let me take on who causes us to triumph.
[time=1444] Father, thank you so much this morning.
[time=1456] Thank you so much for the testimony of these girls.
[time=1459] As they would stand up and sing and radiate your praises, the love of Christ upon each and any of everyone,
[time=1465] dominating the countenance of their face.
[time=1468] Father, I thank you for their commitment to you.
[time=1471] I thank you for the clarity of the message as they sing.
[time=1474] Father, I thank you for a trumpet solo, for the musical solos, and for all of the ways that we've been able to worship you this morning.
[time=1482] Father, as we turn now to your precious word, I would ask that you would work with the power of your Holy Spirit upon all those that are present, that we would be able to hear what it is that you have for us this morning.
[time=1493] Father, I would come to you this morning on behalf of Essa York, and I would just ask you to be with her right at this very moment in the bed that she lays in.
[time=1502] Father, as she goes through these last days of her life, I would pray that you would give her strength.
[time=1507] I pray that you would give her comfort and encouragement, make yourself present to her in every way.
[time=1513] I thank you for the faith that she has had in you for so long.
[time=1516] The faith that she has given to so many, the testimony that she has given about you for so long.
[time=1522] But Father, we would also praise you.
[time=1524] Praise you for one like John Schellenbarger, who's been raised from a bed of affliction.
[time=1529] Out of a coma, back home, and soon to go through physical therapy to recover from a head injury.
[time=1535] Father, I would pray for all of those that are here this morning.
[time=1538] I'd pray that you would heal hurts.
[time=1540] I'd pray that if there's damaged emotions, if there's battered feelings, Father, I'd just pray that you would settle those nerves now.
[time=1548] I'd just pray that you would give peace within a discomforted heart.
[time=1553] I'd just pray that you would give tranquility to lives.
[time=1556] Father, most of all, I'd pray that you would speak through me now as I proclaim your word in Christ's name.
[time=1562] [AMEN] In the year 1960, the National Football League expanded.
[time=1571] One of the new expansion teams was known as the Dallas Cowboys.
[time=1575] The Dallas Cowboys had a brand new, inexperienced head coach by the name of Tom Landry.
[time=1581] They had very few veterans on that team.
[time=1584] In fact, they were made up almost entirely of untried rookies.
[time=1588] Free agents that they had been able to sign, but there was definitely a lack of experience on that young team.
[time=1594] They knew they had their work cut out for them.
[time=1597] They went through their first NFL season.
[time=1600] They didn't win a single game.
[time=1602] They were able to squeak out a tie, but their record of zero, eleven losses, and one tie was the worst in the previous 18 years in the National Football League.
[time=1613] But the young team, although disappointed, was not discouraged.
[time=1618] You see, the young coach, Tom Landry, had a blueprint.
[time=1622] Landry knew that it takes years to build a winning team.
[time=1626] And so Tom Landry, knowing that, began to implement a blueprint for building the Dallas Cowboys into the championship team that they would one day become.
[time=1637] Landry's blueprint was implemented, and it began to work.
[time=1641] Let me share some of his ideas with you this morning as we speak on the subject of a blueprint for conquering kingdoms.
[time=1650] Tom Landry said this, "No individual, no matter how great, can ever be treated as more important than the rest of the team."
[time=1659] Landry said, "Emotion is important, but emotion cannot replace preparation for its true preparation that builds confidence in a team."
[time=1671] Landry also said that when drafting players, draft those that are great players, but also look for those that have great character
[time=1679] in their lives.
[time=1680] For Landry believed that a great player, no matter how outstanding, will let you down if the character is not there.
[time=1687] But a player who's not quite as good will rise up to greatness if he has the character and the drive to make it in the National Football League.
[time=1696] Well, Landry said several things.
[time=1699] They were all part of his blueprint.
[time=1702] Slowly that blueprint began to take shape, it began to work.
[time=1706] In 1961 the Dallas Cowboys were able to win three games.
[time=1710] The next year they were able to win five, and then it was seven.
[time=1714] And then it was ten and eleven, and in 1967 they made it to the National Football League Championship game against the much feared Green Bay Packers.
[time=1724] They didn't win that game, but they would come back again, and over the next twenty years they would win two Super Bowls.
[time=1731] Then they would play in three more, and the Dallas team would never have another losing season for the next twenty years.
[time=1740] You see, Tom Landry had a blueprint.
[time=1743] He realized that blueprints are necessary, whether we're building a great team, whether we're building a great church building,
[time=1752] whether we're building a great church, or whether we're building a great golf course.
[time=1758] They must have a blueprint, a plan of action, a step-by-step process whereby that building will take place.
[time=1767] You know, James, the brother of our Lord, also knew that.
[time=1770] And in the Epistle to James, in the first chapter, James gives us what I believe is a blueprint for building a conquering church.
[time=1779] A blueprint that if we will follow will continue to help Blackhawk to be the great force that it has been for the Kingdom of God
[time=1787] in the first twenty years of its existence.
[time=1790] We have accomplished great things at our church because of the tremendous blessing of God upon our lives and our people.
[time=1798] But God has given us a blueprint, and I believe that if we will follow it, we don't have to stop here.
[time=1805] We can continue on, and as we look into the horizons of our church's second twenty years of existence,
[time=1812] I believe that there are more kingdoms that can be conquered for Jesus Christ if we will follow the blueprint that is found in His Word.
[time=1821] Turn with me if you would to James chapter one, James chapter one,
[time=1828] and in verses 19 to 27, verses 19 to 27, I want us to see three aspects of James's blueprint for building a conquering church.
[time=1840] Three aspects of a great blueprint that if we will follow as individuals in our lives first,
[time=1848] as individual believers here at Blackhawk, if we will implement these things into our lives,
[time=1854] then corporately together we will become a mighty army and will continue on with the great work that we have seen so far in the history of our church.
[time=1865] I'd like to read these verses to you, verses 19 to 27.
[time=1870] My dear brothers, take note of this. James is saying, watch this, this is important.
[time=1876] Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to become angry.
[time=1882] For man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.
[time=1887] Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the Word planted in you which can save you.
[time=1896] Do not merely listen to the Word and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
[time=1901] Anyone who listens to the Word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror.
[time=1908] And after looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
[time=1913] But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard but doing it.
[time=1921] He will be blessed in what he does.
[time=1924] If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight reign on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.
[time=1933] Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this.
[time=1937] To look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[time=1945] The first point that I would like to raise in our blueprint today for building a conquering church is found in the first three verses 19 to 21.
[time=1954] And that is we as individuals need to be receptive to the Word.
[time=1960] We need to be receptive to the inerrant Word of God so that we can take it into our lives and give it a place in our heart that we might begin there for being a part of this great blueprint.
[time=1972] We need to be receptive to the Word.
[time=1974] James gives us several commands which if we will follow, will help us to become receptive to his Word.
[time=1982] He says first of all be quick to listen, be quick to listen.
[time=1988] James is saying give your attention to the Word of God, give your attention to God's Word.
[time=1996] When it's preached, when it's taught, when it's discussed in a Sunday school class, when it's discussed among friends, James is saying be a listener, be quick to listen.
[time=2008] Don't jump, but listen because listening is the first step in the process of learning.
[time=2016] Be a good listener.
[time=2018] I have to admit to you that I am not a good listener.
[time=2021] I have a hard time following someone no matter how interesting they are for more than a few minutes without letting my mind wander.
[time=2029] That's embarrassing and I've embarrassed myself a few times on more than one occasion.
[time=2034] Perhaps you're at a wedding reception or you're at some type of social gathering and you're speaking with somebody and all of a sudden something goes through your mind that you forgot to do.
[time=2044] Have you ever had that happen?
[time=2045] Or perhaps a thought comes into your mind and it shakes you for a moment and you kind of tune out the person that you've been speaking with.
[time=2053] And I can remember having that happen and for the next two minutes I didn't hear a word those people said.
[time=2059] And then it becomes embarrassing because you realize that all of a sudden your mind comes back and the person is staring at you.
[time=2066] And it's obvious that they've asked you a question and they're expecting an answer.
[time=2071] And you realize that for the last five minutes your mind's been over at the punch bowl and you don't know what that person asked you.
[time=2077] Well, I try something tricky.
[time=2080] I'll say something like this.
[time=2082] Would you mind rephrasing your question? I didn't quite understand it.
[time=2087] And the person looks at you and says, "What are the ages of your children?" (Laughter) Didn't fool him that time.
[time=2097] (Laughter) James says we need to be good listeners.
[time=2102] Quick to listen, quick to listen.
[time=2105] Well, I have to work at being a good listener.
[time=2108] But notice as he goes on he says not only be quick to listen but be slow to speak.
[time=2114] What he is saying there is don't be ready to pounce.
[time=2117] Don't be ready to jump.
[time=2119] Don't be ready to offer your ideas.
[time=2122] Give the person a chance to speak and listen to what they have to say.
[time=2127] Process the information.
[time=2129] Don't already be thinking ahead to what you're going to say as if what you have to say is so much more important than what they do.
[time=2137] He's saying be slow to speak.
[time=2140] Listen to what the person says.
[time=2142] Be a good listener.
[time=2144] Have you ever been involved in a conversation with somebody who's not a good listener?
[time=2148] And they're always ready to jump in.
[time=2150] They're not really listening to what you say.
[time=2152] They just are automatically ready to jump in to tell you what they believe on a certain issue.
[time=2157] They don't really care what you think.
[time=2159] Oh, I've had that happen.
[time=2160] I'm sure you have to.
[time=2161] Sometimes they don't even let you finish your last sentence.
[time=2163] They finish it for you and launch right into what they believe about a certain issue.
[time=2168] James says we're not to do that.
[time=2170] We are to be slow to speak.
[time=2172] Listen carefully.
[time=2174] Two steps to becoming receptive to the word.
[time=2177] I ran across a statistic this week that I thought was good concerning being slow to speak.
[time=2183] Astronaut Michael Collins was speaking at a banquet and he was quoted there that the average man speaks 25,000 words a day.
[time=2193] The average man speaks 25,000 words a day and the average woman speaks 30,000 words a day.
[time=2200] Just leave that right there.
[time=2203] But he goes on to say unfortunately when I come home each day I've spoken my 25,000 words and my wife hasn't even started yet.
[time=2212] We need to be slow to speak.
[time=2216] Quick to listen and then thirdly in these verses he tells us be slow to become angry.
[time=2222] Be slow to anger.
[time=2224] I think what he is speaking about there is a type of angry, combative, argumentative spirit that gets in the way of us being receptive to God's word.
[time=2235] James is saying don't be that contentious type who's always ready to debate, always ready to jump in and argue over what you believe.
[time=2245] Oh I believe there's a time for debate.
[time=2248] I believe there's a time for spirited discussion and I believe that we need to believe what we believe and why we believe it.
[time=2256] But I think that James is teaching us that when we go about with this angry spirit, when we go about with this confrontive, combative type of personality, it gets in the way of our hearing.
[time=2269] Be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to become angry.
[time=2273] I think in a way James is saying get the wax out of your ears.
[time=2278] Get the wax out of your ears and be prepared to receive what it is that I have for you.
[time=2284] You know he goes on to tell us some other things here that are very important.
[time=2288] He says therefore get rid of all the moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you.
[time=2296] I believe that James is saying there get the sin out of your life that is stopping you from receiving the word of God.
[time=2304] Get those things out of your life that are poisoning your mind and are stopping you from being an open receiver to the truth that God's word has for you.
[time=2314] He's saying be receptive, be a good listener, humbly, meekly, receive the word of God.
[time=2323] I like what he says, he says receive the word planted in you.
[time=2327] That to me paints the picture of a seed that's planted in our heart and I believe that he is saying when you're going through your daily life, prepare your heart to receive the word.
[time=2339] Prepare your heart, get the weeds out, cultivate the soil, get them ready and then allow that word to come in and then cultivate it and allow that word to grow in your life.
[time=2351] Allow it to mature. Oh I believe that if we will do that as individual believers here at Blackhawk then we as a corporate body will accomplish the first great necessity for achieving greatness in the kingdom.
[time=2367] For achieving conquering Satan's kingdom.
[time=2371] We can as a body follow this blueprint, this first step and we can accomplish great things.
[time=2378] This morning if you're here, if there's bitterness in your heart, if there's bitterness in your heart for another brother, if there's bitterness in your heart toward God for something that's happened in your life.
[time=2391] Or if there is something in your life which is causing you to have a guilty conscience and it's blocking your receivers from being open to the word of God.
[time=2400] Oh I would pray that you would take the time to settle that this morning and be open to receive the word that we might have the word of God hidden in our heart as we go through this first step of the blueprint for building a conquering church, being receptive to the word.
[time=2417] But you know hearing the word and putting it into our heart is not enough. James goes on to tell us that not only do we need to be receptive to the word but we need to be responsive to the word.
[time=2430] Look at verses 22 through 25. Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror.
[time=2446] And after looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. We'll come back to that little illustration in just a few moments.
[time=2454] But he is talking here about not being a hearer only. James is saying that hearing what God has to say to us is not enough.
[time=2465] It's good and it's important that we do it. But the next step after we have internalized God's word is to be obedient to it, to respond to it and to actively engage ourselves in doing the word of God.
[time=2479] You know the King James version I think has a great way of stating it there. The King James says be a doer of the word. The idea there is be in the state of being a doer.
[time=2492] It's not just an isolated command but be in the state of being a doer. Make that your life. Make yourself a responder to the word.
[time=2502] It's not just enough to hear. We must respond. A few years ago the news reports told of a tragic story. A lady in New York City had been brutally attacked on her way home from work and she'd been killed.
[time=2517] You might say well why would that make the wire services people in New York are killed almost every day. Well the reason was that the police report had said that in the 30 minutes that this lady screamed as she fought for her life against her attacker.
[time=2531] In the 30 minutes that she screamed over 38 people reported that they heard her scream and not one responded by even calling the police and eventually after 30 minutes she succumbed to her attack.
[time=2548] Many times we can hear and we can see what needs to be done but we don't respond. James says for the believer we must not only be a hearer we must be a responder.
[time=2561] Then he speaks these two great illustrations that I think are excellent. Let's go through those. He says that anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and after looking at himself goes away
[time=2576] and immediately forgets what he looks like. James is describing there the person who hears the word only and doesn't do anything about it.
[time=2585] He says that the person who hears but doesn't react is like the man who looks into the mirror like you and I do every day who sees what needs to be done.
[time=2594] I looked in the mirror this morning and saw that I needed a shave that I needed to brush my teeth. There were things that needed to be done but James says the one who is the hearer only is like the man who sees those things that needs to be done and then just walks away from the mirror doesn't do them and forgets it.
[time=2612] You know to hear only and then not to do what we perceive needs to be done does not accomplish much is what that illustration is saying.
[time=2621] But the doer the one who both hears and then does what he is told is found in verse 25. The man who looks intently into the perfect law that's God's word that gives freedom and continues to do this not forgetting what he has heard but doing it will be blessed in what he does.
[time=2640] He will be blessed in what he does. The faith of a doer is active and it's dynamic. He is saying that the faith of a doer is alive faith.
[time=2653] James will later say faith without works is dead and what he is telling us there that as believers we must not only hear the word of God but we must react to it and our faith needs to be one of a dynamic working conquering faith.
[time=2674] This little notice was up in an office building in Detroit, Michigan and it deals with this idea of I believe faith in works because we are told in the word that if our faith is vibrant that it's alive and it will be different.
[time=2690] There will be something different about us as believers from the one who does has no faith and who has no works to go with it. Listen to this employees in a Detroit business office found the following important notice on the bulletin board.
[time=2704] The management regrets that it has come to their attention that workers dying on the job are failing to fall down.
[time=2712] This practice must stop as it becomes impossible to distinguish between death and the natural movement of the staff.
[time=2721] That's not the pastoral staff. Any employee found dead in an upright position will be dropped from the payroll immediately.
[time=2729] All that person put that up in a tongue in a cheek way but what we are really seeing here is that if we are to be alive in our faith, if we are to have a living conquering faith, then we must not just be heroes of the word but doers of the word and there ought to be something different about the doer of the word.
[time=2749] There ought to be something different that stands out in his life as he goes about doing the work of the kingdom when we would compare him to someone who is a hero only.
[time=2760] The Bible teaches that we are to be doers of the word and so we have been heroes and then we must respond to the word.
[time=2770] Thirdly and lastly this morning I believe we must be resigned to the word, resigned to the word.
[time=2780] We all know what the word resign means when reference to a job or something like that. When we resign from a job it means that we leave it or we say we no longer want to be a part of a certain group or organization or corporation.
[time=2795] But you know if you look in Webster's dictionary you'll also see that to be resigned or to resign means to surrender without opposition, to give oneself over totally without opposition.
[time=2810] I believe that in verses 26 and 27 James teaches us that we need to be resigned to the word. We need not just be heroes and doers only but he is saying we need to be totally resigned.
[time=2825] He is saying that we need to turn our life over to the word of God. We need to allow it to totally remake us as we feast upon it as we read it and hear it and do it.
[time=2837] We need to allow it to permeate us inside and out. Paul speaks about it in Romans when he talks about becoming a new creation and he talks about the renewing of the mind.
[time=2848] He says that renew your mind by the word of God and by resigning ourselves to the word we are saying that we want all that the word of God has for us.
[time=2858] We wanted to make it a part of our being. We wanted to clean us inside and out. I believe that James explains what he's talking about here in verse 26.
[time=2869] If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.
[time=2880] What is James saying there? He is saying that we can hear the word. Yes, we can do the word but unless there has been a change in our lives unless the word of God is allowed to change us both inside and out.
[time=2897] Then we have not truly become what God wants us to be spiritually. We can do good works and we can do all of these things but still not be right in our heart with God.
[time=2909] We can hear the word. We can respond and we can go through baptism. We can take communion. We can work in a Sunday school class.
[time=2918] We can go into all of the various programs of the church and we can work but James is saying that's not enough for a true religion.
[time=2928] The type of religion that God wants you to have you must be totally resigned to the word.
[time=2935] Now what does he mean by resigned? He means that we must show it on the outside and we also must show it on the inside.
[time=2943] Let's look at verse 27. He says religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this.
[time=2951] Then he gives another illustration. To look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[time=2961] James there gives us the two points that he wants to make that are needed to be resigned to the world.
[time=2966] The first thing is being responsive to the word, doing the good works. Those are all good things and we are to do those things.
[time=2974] We must do them. We are commanded to do them as a believer and he uses the example of taking care of orphans and taking care of widows.
[time=2983] And that's good. In the time that James lived that was a very important ministry of the church. It can still be an important ministry of our church today but it doesn't stop there.
[time=2993] James says that's good and that outward show of works is good but then he says but just as importantly and perhaps even more importantly you are to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[time=3006] He is saying there's an outward sign. There's an inward sign and the inward sign is to be personally personal holiness and righteous living.
[time=3016] That we are to seek to feast upon the word and to allow it to renew us so that we can walk in obedience to it and allow the word of God to transform us and to change us into that pure being both inside and out that God wants for us to be.
[time=3034] Most of you know that prior to going into the ministry I worked in the scrap iron and steel business for about eight years.
[time=3043] I remember very early in the process of learning the business the importance of the quality of the product that I was selling to a foundry or steel mill as they would then melt that product down to make new steel or new cast iron.
[time=3057] I found out how important it was as I watched in a foundry as a trained metaller just watched very closely over the formation of the cast iron as it was made.
[time=3067] They started by putting all the various grades of scrap iron and steel into a furnace and melted it down.
[time=3074] Then they added the chemicals that would give the cast iron or steel the required purity and strength and all that it needed to fulfill the specifications that their customer had given to them.
[time=3086] I watched carefully as a metaller just would take and dip from the furnace and do an instant analysis of the molten metal so that he could tell if it had the analysis that it needed.
[time=3098] Then I would watch as he would finish his job, he would then wait for the casting to harden and then he would take what was called a spectrometer and x-ray machine and would x-ray the casting both inside and out to see if it was the quality that was necessary to sell to the customer.
[time=3117] You see there was a reason for that.
[time=3119] It's very easy for a piece of steel or a casting to look good on the outside.
[time=3125] You can polish it up, you can clean it off and when it's dried, it'll look good.
[time=3130] It'll look great.
[time=3132] But on the inside, if it hasn't been made properly, there will be flaws.
[time=3137] Bubbles can develop in the process and they can dry with holes inside of it that weaken it and stop it from having the strength that's needed and what might happen.
[time=3148] If the customer, if the producer doesn't check the quality and he sends that casting out into the field, that might go onto an airplane as a casting that holds on a wing or a propeller.
[time=3159] It might go to a ski area and be the casting that holds the ski lift on as it goes up the side of a mountain.
[time=3167] It might be the casting that goes for something that holds on the brake system of a car or a truck.
[time=3173] And if that casting is not pure on the inside and is not as good on the inside as it looks on the outside, it'll fail.
[time=3181] And when that casting fails, the producer will have to be liable for any damages that are incurred.
[time=3188] You see, just like for a human, a casting has to be clean on the inside and it needs to be clean on the outside.
[time=3195] James is saying here, we must be resigned to the word. We must be resigned to the word.
[time=3203] We must be willing to feast upon the word of God and allow it to come into our body and change us from the inside out so that we will have, yes, all of the works that are necessary, but also the changed life, the changed heart, the life of purity that God wants for us to have.
[time=3224] The spirit-filled believer walks steadfastly in obedience and is firm in his convictions.
[time=3232] So what do we have this morning as we come very close to the clothes of our service?
[time=3237] We have a blueprint, I believe, for building a conquering church.
[time=3241] It begins with being receptive to the word and all of us as individuals must prepare our lives and cultivate our hearts to be receptive to the word because learning is the first step.
[time=3253] And hearing is the first step in the learning process.
[time=3256] And then we must be willing not only to hear but to respond and to go out and to carry on the great work of the church.
[time=3264] Our church has had what you might call a great run.
[time=3268] We have had two faithful pastors that have preached the word.
[time=3271] They've preached it boldly and strongly and clearly.
[time=3275] And as I look out this morning, I see literally hundreds here today that have heard the word, have internalized it and have become doers of the word.
[time=3285] I see those that have had the word of God challenged in their hearts and have taken the word of God into their heart and they have allowed it to cleanse them inside and out and they're resigned to the word.
[time=3299] Those three things I believe create a blueprint. And if we together as a group of believers, corporately at Blackhawk, will implement those three aspects into our lives, then I can believe that there are new horizons for us to conquer.
[time=3313] New things for us to do, new ministries for us to penetrate and begin and to drive into.
[time=3319] Room for expansion here that we might continue to grow as we have during these initial years of our church's life.
[time=3326] All my challenge this morning would be two things.
[time=3330] If you're here today and you're a believer, perhaps you've never been a doer.
[time=3337] You've never truly been resigned to the word. You've been a hero only.
[time=3342] All my challenge would be that you would get off the bench, get in the game and be an active part of the blueprint.
[time=3350] Be an active part of the conquering church. Join us in the various ministries and ways that you can serve.
[time=3358] But also this morning, I would challenge those that are here this morning who have never truly been receptive to the word of God when they've heard it preached.
[time=3367] Perhaps there's someone here this morning. You've heard the gospel preached many, many times, but something has presented the word of God from piercing your heart and causing you to realize your need to trust in Christ as your Savior and as your Lord.
[time=3384] Oh, it would be my prayer this morning that if that would be the case for you, that if you've heard the gospel preached that this morning you would realize that Christ died for you.
[time=3394] That he died and shed his blood that you might have everlasting life.
[time=3400] And I would pray that you would receive the word of God today and in a few moments as we sing together, I would pray that you would come, that you would give your life to Christ and become a part of this mighty army.
[time=3413] Become a part of the blueprint for building a conquering church. Join the rest of us as we go into the next several years of working for Christ.
[time=3423] Then perhaps lastly, there's someone here today and you want to join in the fellowship of our church as four did in the first service.
[time=3432] I would just challenge you to come and join and become a part of the membership of Blackhawk Baptist Church and list in the army that we might be able to do for you and help you and help you get involved in the work of the church.
[time=3445] Father, thank you so much.
[time=3462] [MUSIC]
[time=3477] This morning we have been enjoying the music of the Sanctuary Choir, Solos by Kevin Rowe, also the music of Gary Kance and the Girls Ensemble.
[time=3486] It's been my privilege to speak with you this morning from the Word of God.
[time=3490] Perhaps as I was preaching the Word, you sensed a need to trust Christ as your Savior. If you did, I would highly encourage you to pray along with me now to receive Him as your Savior and Lord.
[time=3501] Father, I know that you sent your Son Jesus Christ to die for my sins and I realize that I need to repent of my sins and receive Jesus Christ as my Savior and as my Lord.
[time=3513] Lord, I just ask you to come into my heart now, give me everlasting life. In Jesus' name, Amen.
[time=3521] If you made that decision for Jesus Christ today, I would invite you to write for the booklet Lessons on Assurance to help you get started on your spiritual walk with God.
