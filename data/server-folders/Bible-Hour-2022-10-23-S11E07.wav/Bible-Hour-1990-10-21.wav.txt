[time=60] - The internationally known artist, Gustav Doar, was traveling throughout Europe when he realized that he had lost his passport.
[time=79] As he went to the border to cross into the next country, the guard asked him to produce it.
[time=83] He said, "I've lost my passport, but I'm Gustav Doar the artist." The guard said, "Mr. Doar, I believe you, but I'll need to see evidence that you are indeed who you say that you are."
[time=94] Gustav Doar sat down and drew a marvelous picture of the room in the guard and all that was around him.
[time=100] The guard looked at the picture and said, "Indeed, this is all the evidence I need. You are Gustav Doar."
[time=106] The Bible teaches that we are to not only have a profession of faith, but there is to be evidence that we indeed are a true believer.
[time=114] In the fifth chapter of Matthew, Jesus said that we are to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[time=119] Do you know what it means to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world?
[time=123] Come with us this morning as we look at this exciting passage from Matthew and learn about evidence for our Christian faith.
[time=131] (music playing)
[time=139] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=145] Thank you for joining us.
[time=147] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=150] Jim's message, entitled "Sulf, Light, and the Influence We Have", is taken from the Book of Matthew chapter 5 verses 13 through 16.
[time=160] Special music today includes a solo from Denise Mitchell and an instrumental duet from Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=168] We now join our service as the Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra bring us a song entitled "Praise Him, Praise Him".
[time=178] (music playing)
[time=201] Praise Him, Praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer.
[time=208] Sing over this wonderful opera play.
[time=215] (music playing)
[time=244] Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=249] Help His excellent three best.
[time=253] Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=256] Never a joyful soul.
[time=262] (music playing) Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=269] Jesus our blessed Redeemer.
[time=273] O Lord our sins, He suffered and led and died.
[time=282] Be your rock, our open eternal salvation.
[time=289] Hail, hear, hear, Jesus our cursed Father.
[time=298] Love is praise Him.
[time=302] Jesus who bore our sorrows.
[time=306] Love and love them, wonderful demons come.
[time=314] Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=318] Help His excellent three best.
[time=322] Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=326] Never a joyful soul.
[time=331] (music playing) Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=338] Jesus our blessed Redeemer.
[time=343] Praise Him, Praise Him.

[time=363] (music playing)
[time=373] Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=376] (music playing)
[time=387] Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=391] Love is excellent three best.
[time=402] Praise Him, Praise Him.
[time=425] (applause)
[time=432] Let's continue our victory in Jesus by singing that song, number 473.
[time=438] Him number 473, we'll sing all three verses.
[time=443] (music playing)
[time=663] Appreciate your ministering with us this morning.
[time=665] Right now listen to Denise Mitchell if she comes to me to us in song.
[time=672] (music playing)
[time=687] Just the way that he was born, that miracle alone deserves our share.
[time=702] All the wonders he performed should stir the heart of praise in every land.
[time=713] Then he paid the final cost on a lonely Roman cross, and he reached out his hand.
[time=731] And if that's not enough, tell me who does he have to be.
[time=740] Before you will praise him, what does he have to give before you receive?
[time=752] How many struggles you face must he overcome?
[time=758] What does he have to do that he hasn't already done?
[time=772] (music playing)
[time=778] Will we ever comprehend this longing of our spirits to exalt him?
[time=793] Though the cross was not the end, it seemed we'd buried hope inside the grave.
[time=806] He left an empty tomb behind, if you go there you will find that he's worthy of praise.
[time=826] And if that's not enough, tell me who does he have to be.
[time=835] Before you will praise him, what does he have to give before you receive?
[time=847] How many struggles you face must he overcome?
[time=854] What does he have to do?
[time=861] What does he have to do that he hasn't already done?
[time=874] (music playing)
[time=903] Good morning, and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=906] Your regular host, Pete Coby, is away again this Sunday.
[time=909] He's visiting his oldest son, Peter, down at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.
[time=914] But joining me this morning on the Bible Hour is Brad Moore.
[time=917] Good morning, Brad.
[time=918] Good morning, Jim.
[time=919] Brad is our staff director of Blueprint for Building Lives.
[time=922] Brad, tell us what Blueprint for Building Lives is all about.
[time=926] Jim, the ministry here at Blackhawk, has always focused on preaching the Word and teaching the Word.
[time=933] We feel that we need extra space to do that with our adult Bible fellowships, with our children's programs, with our super-60s programs, with our school.
[time=942] So consequently, right now we're in the midst of a fall campaign that will be a three-year commitment program
[time=949] to raise money to put on this new edition for putting classrooms on right to the extension here of the worship center.
[time=958] Well, Brad, what exactly will the edition be?
[time=961] There'll be classrooms, but I think there's something else involved in that also, isn't there?
[time=964] The plan, Jim, really is to put on enough space that we can move our high school program over on this side of the street.
[time=972] They'll use it during the week, and then we will have access to those 10 or 12 classrooms and a multi-purpose gymnasium, which will be built with the same construction.
[time=982] And we'll be able to use that then on Sundays and for special events that we have here.
[time=987] Well, Brad, I know that many of the Sunday school classes that currently are moving back and forth across the street are looking forward very much to having a building on this side of the street that they can use.
[time=997] And I also know that many of the elderly in our church are looking for a building where they can go and have classes on the first floor, not having to climb those stairs.
[time=1005] Well, I'm excited about Blueprint for Building Lives, Brad. I'm sure that you are too.
[time=1010] Thank you for joining us this morning.
[time=1012] Well, we wanted to let you folks at home know about what's going on in the life of Blackhawk.
[time=1017] Blueprint for Building Lives, we're in the midst of a capital funds drive.
[time=1021] We're looking forward to that. That drive will be culminating soon, and we'll be reporting back to you on the Bible Hour about the results of that capital funds drive.
[time=1030] We're looking forward in our church to some other things also.
[time=1033] October 21st will be a very special day for us here at Blackhawk.
[time=1037] On October 21st, we will be in a one-service format.
[time=1041] We'll be meeting here for only one service rather than two.
[time=1044] We'll be meeting at 1030 together as one group glorifying Jesus together and worshiping on that Sunday.
[time=1051] We're meeting that day for a final report on Blueprint for Building Lives.
[time=1055] It's going to be an exciting morning.
[time=1057] You still have some time to plan to join us and share with us that great morning.
[time=1062] And then in the evening service, we also have something planned, especially for October 21st, and that is something called Exaltation.
[time=1070] Exaltation will be a combination of the Blackhawk Baptist Church Sanctuary Choir, but also another church from Anderson, Indiana, who will come.
[time=1078] They will unite in their voices, and Exaltation will be our tremendous presentation on that evening service.
[time=1085] Well, as you know on the Bible Hour, we like to offer you some very good things for you to read and to help build you in your Christian life, and it's no different for the month of October.
[time=1096] We have this month for anyone who will write to us and ask a tremendous book by Billy Graham entitled "Answers to Life's Problems."
[time=1104] Billy Graham is one of the fine authors of today.
[time=1107] Billy has one of those great ways of not only being a tremendous preacher of the Word and a tremendous evangelist, but he has a great way of taking deep theological truth and bringing it down to the level that everyone can understand.
[time=1121] I often, as I'm planning a study for an evening preaching service at Blackhawk, I will go and study the various reference books that I have and use the tools, but often I then turn to Billy Graham and see what he's written on that subject.
[time=1135] He's a very fluent writer, and I would just encourage you to write for this book "Answers to Life Problems."
[time=1141] If you would like to receive this book, "Answers to Life's Problems," you can write to us at the Bible Hour. The address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1159] Well, thank you for joining us again this morning for the Bible Hour. We are about to go back to our morning worship service and the live portion.
[time=1166] I'm looking very much looking forward to preaching the Word to you this morning. Let's go back to our morning service at this time.
[time=1196] [MUSIC - 356 seconds]
[time=1574] Let us remain always close to you, walking not in Ryan's hope, but in Christian hope, for our destination is heaven and not Dallas. May the mothers and fathers of our community always say to you, "Bless and protect all my children. These are truly the days of our lives." And so as the world turns, should some of us find that we need to go to the doctors in general hospital, may we always keep you, dear God, as our guiding light.
[time=1601] We will not then be concerned with a foolish search for tomorrow, waiting for the edge of night. For together, dear Lord, we will sail away from nots landing and create another world. Amen.
[time=1615] Back when Linda and I first became believers, there was a wonderful elderly lady in our church, but she had gotten to the point where she was having trouble telling the difference between reality and fantasy.
[time=1627] And she would come to our prayer time on Wednesday night, so would ask for prayer for Jesse on general hospital because the latest problem that was involved in her life.
[time=1636] Well, let's ask the Lord to bless the remainder of our time together today. Father, thank you again for the joy of serving you. Thank you for the fact that we can open your word now, we can study, and we can learn things anew in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1651] During the 1970s and the mid-1970s, a book was published entitled "Dress for Success." The book was subtitled "Look like a million so you can make a million."
[time=1663] The premise of the book was simply this, that the way that we dress, the style by which we dress, influences the way other people perceive us.
[time=1674] And so John Malloy wrote that if we dressed properly for all of the proper occasions in our business careers, that we could have great influence over those that we came in contact with, indeed, we could have great influence that would lead us to make more money, would lead us to higher levels of social prestige, would give us all of the things that we want in life, if we would just use the influence of power dressing.
[time=1700] John Malloy taught that the proper suit can intimidate, the proper suit can show authority, the proper suit can make those uncomfortable that are around us and to see the power that we exude from our person.
[time=1715] Well, a lot of what John Malloy wrote was true. The fact of the matter is, in some ways, by the way that we dress, we can influence others.
[time=1724] And we think in our society today of influencing others to benefit ourselves. The bookstores are lined with self-help books on various ways of promoting ourselves, influencing others, so that we can benefit financially, socially.
[time=1741] Whatever it might be, the bookstores tell us we can have what we want. We can have that influence.
[time=1747] Other books that are followed have been books like pulling your own strings. How to sell yourself? How to sell anything to anybody?
[time=1756] Another book was titled The Female Advantage. All of these books were written from different perspectives, but the idea was that if we would follow their plan, we could have influence over others that we came in contact with,
[time=1770] and we could be more successful and have more power and prestige and money if we would follow what these books said.
[time=1777] Well, I'm certainly not against learning how to be a better marketer or learning various sales techniques. They're good.
[time=1783] But you know, it's not just in books that they talk about that. If you watch commercials on television, they're also telling us how we can have influence over others to benefit ourselves.
[time=1794] For years, one toothpaste has advertised itself as the toothpaste that gives you sex appeal, and if you will use this toothpaste, it will give you influence over the opposite sex.
[time=1806] Of course, there are other commercials. There are the shampoo commercials that teach us that if we will use their shampoo, we can avoid the problems of dandruff, and we can have influence over others.
[time=1817] I remember one commercial, it shows an attorney, and he's having a bad day. The judge isn't giving him any respect. The jury's not giving him any respect, and his beautiful prosecuting attorney is sitting across from him, and she looks over at him, and you can hear her saying to herself,
[time=1832] "Oh, he's so handsome. What a shame that he's got dandruff." And so the idea was that if he would use this dandruff shampoo, he could have influence over the judge, influence over the prosecuting attorney, influence over the jury,
[time=1846] in every way he would be a more successful attorney, and would be more successful in life. Well, commercials, books, they all tell us these things, but all of them are to help us have influence to better ourselves.
[time=1861] Influence that will make us richer. Influence that will make us more powerful. They're teaching us to use influence to better ourselves, to better our lot in life.
[time=1873] Well, in the fifth chapter of the book of Matthew, Jesus is also speaking about influence. He's speaking about the importance that we have as believers of having influence into the world in which we go.
[time=1886] But you know, the important difference is this. We can read books, we can watch television, we can use products, and hopefully we can gain influence over others, and we can benefit ourselves in our lives.
[time=1898] But this morning, Jesus talks about being the soul of the earth, the light of the world, and he is talking about having influence, but not influence to help ourselves, but influence that will help us to bring others in to the kingdom of God.
[time=1914] Influence that will help us to be a force in the world in which we live, that we will be able to go out and be a force for good, and to turn around the corruption and the spoilage that we see in this world that surround us.
[time=1927] In our verses today, it's a very familiar scripture. Jesus is in verse 13 of the fifth chapter of the book of Matthew, and Jesus is speaking to us.
[time=1938] As we read these verses this morning, I want us to see three aspects of the influence which Christ has commanded us to have in this world.
[time=1947] Three aspects of the influence that Christ has commanded us to have, and influence for good to a dying and corrupt world.
[time=1958] And influence, whereby if we will use it, we can go out into the world and retard the corruption that is at work in this world in which we live, and can give us the power and the strength to be an influence for the kingdom of God.
[time=1972] Jesus is speaking to the disciples here, but he of course is speaking to us today. In verse 13 he says, "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
[time=1986] It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men. You are the light of the world.
[time=1993] A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[time=2004] In the same way, let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven."
[time=2012] In this original text as Jesus was delivering this great message, Jesus was speaking, and as he was, I believe he was looking at the multitudes around him, and he saw the world in which he and they lived.
[time=2027] I believe he saw the empty faces. I believe he saw the broken homes and broken families. I believe that Jesus saw the moral decay.
[time=2037] I believe that Jesus saw the religious hypocrisy and the fact that people were not hearing the message that he had for them to hear a great way, a new way, a way of coming to him and through him to the Father.
[time=2052] I believe that as Jesus spoke these words, we can also look at our world today. We can see a world that is in the same way, the same situation, a world going through decay, a world going through corruption, a world going through this throes of families that are splitting apart.
[time=2072] We're going also through a time of religious hypocrisy as they were in Jesus' day. We are going through a time of moral decay and moral values in our world where the sanctity of life and things such as that are not respected by many in this world in which we live.
[time=2088] But Jesus has given us a directive. Jesus in these words has told us three things. The first thing I want us to see is the plan.
[time=2098] Jesus says, "You are the salt of the earth. You are the light of the world." Jesus' plan to retard the corruption, to retard the spoilage in our world today in which we live is for you and I to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[time=2118] Notice in verse 13, he says, "You are the salt of the earth." In verse 14, he says, "You are the light of the world."
[time=2126] As Jesus looked out at his disciples, Jesus didn't say to them, "The scribes, the Pharisees, and all of you, you are the light of the world." No. He looked at his disciples.
[time=2138] And I believe that as Jesus speaks to us from his word this morning, he's not saying to us that the United Nations is the light of the world or the salt of the earth.
[time=2147] He's not saying that the salt of the earth is the organization of American states. He's saying it's you. He's saying it's me. And he's saying, "I have a plan and you are my plan.
[time=2159] You are to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world." Now what does it mean then? How is it then? If this is Jesus' plan, what does he mean by being the salt of the earth and the light of the world?
[time=2170] How are we to carry out his plan? Well, I believe that because it's not explained well, there's a little bit of speculation, but I believe we can really see exactly what he meant when he said, "We are to be the salt in the light." Let's look first at the salt.
[time=2185] In Christ's day, salt was a very, very valuable commodity. And I think he was telling his disciples, "You are very valuable to my kingdom. You are my plan for going out into the world."
[time=2199] Salt was a very valuable commodity for two reasons. Number one, it was valuable for preservation. Before those days of electricity and refrigeration, there was no way of keeping food from spoiling.
[time=2210] But by rubbing salt into the meat, they could retard the spoilage, they could retard the corruption, and the meat would last for several days.
[time=2220] Well, I believe that Jesus knew that. And as he told them, he realized that the disciples would see what he was trying to tell them. He said, "You are the salt of the earth. You are the salt. You are the one that I'm sending."
[time=2233] You know, the Roman soldiers, when money was tied in the Roman government, would be paid in salt. That's where we get the term that someone's not worth his salt from the fact that Roman soldiers were paid in salt. That's how valuable a commodity it was.
[time=2248] Well, Jesus says, "You are the salt of the earth." What exactly did he mean? Many have speculated many times about what he meant. Let's look at a few of the various possibilities.
[time=2258] Some have said that it means purity, that when Jesus said that we are the salt of the earth, he was talking about purity because salt is white, and white is the word for purity, and therefore we are to be the salt which purifies the world in which we live.
[time=2275] All that's possible. And then Jesus goes on to, others have gone on to say some other things. Others have said that he meant that we are to be flavoring, that salt was a flavoring agent for the food of Jesus' day, and that we as believers are to be the flavoring agent of the world in which we live.
[time=2293] And we are to give flavor to the world around us.
[time=2297] Others have written that perhaps he was talking about cleansing, for salt was used to cleanse wounds, and as the cleansing process would go on, it would sting in the wound.
[time=2308] And some have speculated that Jesus was saying that we are to be a cleansing force. We are to be a cleansing force, and as we are, we will sting as we prick the conscious of the world around us.
[time=2321] Well, perhaps all of those are correct. Perhaps some of them are. But I believe that at work here is the idea of preservation.
[time=2329] I believe what Jesus meant here was that you and I, as the salt of the earth, are to be the salt, the preserver that goes out into the world in which we live, and we are to attempt with our goodness to preserve and to retard the spoilage of the world.
[time=2346] And through the influence for good, we are to hold back the success of evil in our world, and in ways are to make it better.
[time=2355] I believe that Jesus saw a spoiling world. In many ways our society is spoiling and is corrupt today.
[time=2363] Jesus was saying, "You are the preservative. You and I go out into the world and preserve it and retard the spoiling process."
[time=2373] Well, I believe that we do that by the life we live. When Jesus said, "You are the salt of the earth," I believe that He was speaking about a godly example that we are to set.
[time=2382] I don't believe that He is speaking so much here about the words that we speak, but by the example that we set, by the way that we live, by the way that we show our love for others, by the way that we reach out and live a godly life.
[time=2396] Jesus says that if we will be attractive, if we will be winsome, if we will be godly, others will see in us what it is that they don't have, and they will want that for their life.
[time=2408] And then He goes on to say, "Not only are we the salt of the earth, but we are the light of the world."
[time=2414] To understand what He meant by the light of the world, we have to remember that Jesus was the Word of God, the living Word.
[time=2422] We have today the written Word of God, and the Bible speaks about the Word of God being the light of the world.
[time=2430] When Jesus said that we are to be the light of the world, what He was saying was that we, through the proclamation of His Word, through the preaching of His Word, through the sharing of His Word, we are to expose the darkness in the world around us.
[time=2446] We are to be the one that exposes the darkness by the fact that we proclaim His Word, make it known, and the light will expose the corruption and the sin in the world around us.
[time=2458] Jesus says that we are to live by a good example.
[time=2462] We are to make others attracted to us by the way that we live.
[time=2465] Secondly, as the light, we are to proclaim His Word, and through the power of the Holy Spirit, He has promised us that His Word, when it's spoken, will not return void.
[time=2475] We are to be the salt, we are to be the light.
[time=2478] He's talking here about our character and our communication.
[time=2482] And He is saying, "By your character and by your communication, you are to be an effective witness for me."
[time=2489] And others are to see in you an attractiveness that they want, the plan, you and I to be the salt and the light, to conquer a world, to go out and retard the spoilage of the world in which we live.
[time=2504] This week, I was reading about a great hymn writer by the name of Francis Ridley Havergall.
[time=2523] As she wrote these great hymns, she let her light shine as she would take the words of Scripture, put them to song, and many were thrilled and heard the Word of God as she wrote it.
[time=2533] And as it was sung in churches, and as people read the Word in her songs.
[time=2538] But what many don't know about Francis Havergall was that she was also an extremely godly woman, one who was deeply loved for her winsomeness and for the way that she always had time for others.
[time=2550] Francis Havergall once was invited to the Royal Palace in England for a great performance by an Italian opera singer who was going to come and sing for the King of England.
[time=2560] Francis Havergall was invited to come, and as she was there, this man was marvelous, and as he sang, the people were wowed by the beauty of his voice and a wonderfulness as he sang his songs.
[time=2572] At the end, he received a marvelous and standing ovation, and then the King surprisingly turned to her and said, "Miss Havergall, would you now treat us to one of your songs?"
[time=2584] She said she didn't know what to do. How would she follow a wonderful singer such as this man? But she got up.
[time=2591] And as the radiance of the Lord shined from her, she began to sing, "One of her great hymns, take my life and let it be consecrated all to thee."
[time=2602] And as she sang the verses of that great hymn, the people saw in her the character and the love of Jesus Christ.
[time=2610] And it was over. The first man to come to her was that opera singer, and he came to her and he said, "Miss Havergall, you have something.
[time=2617] You have something about you that's different, and I want it for myself. I need it." And she was able to lead him to the Lord.
[time=2625] It says that we are to be the salt of the earth, the light of the world, by our character, by our communication.
[time=2631] We are God's plan for preserving the world in which we live, for winning it to Jesus Christ.
[time=2639] This morning, I would challenge us all.
[time=2642] As we think about those words of salt and light, are you in the fight working as the salt of the earth and the light of the world?
[time=2651] Are you in the battle influencing others for Jesus Christ?
[time=2655] Are you using your influence that God has given you to draw others to you?
[time=2661] I would pray this morning if you're on the sidelines, if you're not a part of the salt of the earth, that you would join in the battle to be the salt of the earth, the light of the world.
[time=2671] And then secondly, as we go on in the verses, he gives us what I have called the problem.
[time=2676] Not only do we have the plan, what Jesus' plan is for us to be the salt in the light, but as we go on, Jesus says we have to be careful because there can be a problem.
[time=2685] Notice in the second part of verse 13, he says, "But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
[time=2693] It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men." And then below in verse 15, as he speaks about the light, he says, "Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[time=2706] Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house." Jesus was saying that we as believers can allow our influence to be held back.
[time=2719] That we as the salt of the earth can be contaminated by those around us if we're not careful to walk in the power of the Holy Spirit that he has given us.
[time=2729] He is also saying that we can hold back and not show our light and not let our light shine, not that we lose it, but that we keep it covered.
[time=2737] You know, it's interesting in the days of our Lord, much of the salt came from the Dead Sea area.
[time=2743] And of course, as people would take the salt and put it into their homes, occasionally that salt would be corrupted by some of the minerals that are there in the Dead Sea.
[time=2752] Be corrupted by gypsum and some of the other minerals, and it would cause the salt to be contaminated.
[time=2758] And when it was contaminated, it was no good.
[time=2760] And as it says here in Scripture, they would take the salt, throw it out on the street, and it would be trampled underfoot.
[time=2767] Jesus is saying that it's his plan for us to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[time=2772] But we must always be careful that we don't allow ourselves, as we interact with the world, to allow the contamination of the world to contaminate our testimony.
[time=2782] That we are to be the one who permeates society and that we are not to be dragged down by society itself.
[time=2790] Yes, we are to be the salt of the earth.
[time=2793] He says we are to be the light of the world, and he says that there can be a problem because we can lose our effectiveness if we cover up our light.
[time=2803] Now, why is it that we would do that?
[time=2805] Why would we not let our light shine in the world?
[time=2808] I think there are several reasons. I think there are times when we refuse to let our light shine because we don't want to offend others.
[time=2815] There are times when we don't take the time to speak the word of God when the chance comes because we're afraid that we might offend.
[time=2823] I think there are also times when we just become indifferent, and we don't have the urgency to go out into the world to be the light of the world.
[time=2831] So through our indifference, we just don't bother to shine our light.
[time=2837] We lose sight sometimes of our first love, and when we do, we hide our light.
[time=2843] Jesus said we must always be careful to never let the salt and the light be contaminated by the world in which we live.
[time=2851] This week or a few weeks ago, we sent our youngest son Kyle to preschool for the first time, and we found out some things about Kyle that maybe we hadn't known.
[time=2860] We always expect that the preacher's kids are supposed to be extremely well behaved, and I think this preacher's kids are pretty well behaved.
[time=2868] As long as I can keep them away from the deacons kids, they'll be okay.
[time=2871] But our four-year-old Kyle, as we sent him to preschool, he came home after the first and second day, and our youngest son has a problem.
[time=2879] He can't go to sleep at night until he confesses every sin he committed that day.
[time=2884] And so as we prayed that day, we spoke to him and we said, Kyle, how was preschool?
[time=2890] He said, it was fine.
[time=2892] I got in trouble.
[time=2896] Linda said, you got in trouble?
[time=2899] Yes.
[time=2900] Well, what happened?
[time=2901] Nothing.
[time=2902] I had to sit on a chair.
[time=2907] What did you do?
[time=2908] Nothing.
[time=2909] I threw toys.
[time=2914] Well, did you throw toys at some of the other boys?
[time=2917] No.
[time=2918] Did you throw toys at your teacher, we shuddered?
[time=2921] No.
[time=2922] Well, did you throw the toys at the wall?
[time=2924] No.
[time=2925] Did you throw the toys on the floor?
[time=2926] No.
[time=2927] Well, who did you throw the toy at?
[time=2929] I threw it at Melissa.
[time=2932] Kyle, why did you do that?
[time=2934] I don't know.
[time=2937] We were just throwing toys.
[time=2940] You know that drove home to me a point that no matter how good we intend to be, no matter
[time=2947] how strong we intend to be in our witness for Christ, we can be influenced by those around us.
[time=2953] Now, please, my son can instigate.
[time=2955] My son is capable of instigating bad behavior just like anybody else.
[time=2960] But I somehow believe that on those first couple of days he began to run with the wrong crowd, you know, and that crowd had an influence upon him.
[time=2970] Well, we had to correct that behavior, and we've been assured that it has been corrected.
[time=2975] But, you know, for a while he lost his saltiness.
[time=2977] He lost his savor.
[time=2979] He didn't let his light shine, and I believe that became obvious.
[time=2983] Well, we have the problem.
[time=2985] You know, we say, "Well, that happens to a four-year-old in preschool, but that wouldn't happen to me." Oh, yeah.
[time=2990] You know, pride go with before a fall.
[time=2993] Whether we're 40 or whether we are 40 or four, we can lose our savor.
[time=2999] We can lose our saltiness.
[time=3000] We can allow the world to contaminate us, and we can lose our usefulness for the kingdom.
[time=3007] Jesus said, "Walk a godly way.
[time=3010] Walk a holy life, and although you are in the world, you are not to be of the world, and I want you to maintain your godly example." Well, the plan, you and I are to be, to solve them the light.
[time=3023] The problem, we at times allow ourselves to be contaminated, and we can lose our effectiveness for the kingdom.
[time=3029] But thirdly, and lastly today, we have what I've called the purpose, the purpose.
[time=3036] Jesus says in verse 16, "In the same way, let your unlight shine before men, that they
[time=3044] see your good deeds, and praise your father in heaven.
[time=3049] In the same way, let your light shine, that they may see your good deeds, and praise your father in heaven." What is it that Jesus is saying that we are to do?
[time=3060] He is saying the purpose of being the salt and the light.
[time=3063] The purpose of everything we do is to bring honor and glory, not to ourselves, but to
[time=3069] bring honor and glory only to God.
[time=3072] Jesus is saying that as we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world, in everything that we do, as we use our influence, as we try to permeate our society and retard this
[time=3082] corruption that we see at work.
[time=3084] He is saying do it all for the honor and for the glory of God.
[time=3088] And don't ever do it for yourself or for your own benefit.
[time=3092] Do it always looking to the glory that can be given to the Father.
[time=3097] You know, as we go about, it's easy to begin to take some of the glory for ourselves.
[time=3103] Jesus says that your supreme calling is to always glorify Him, glorify the Father.
[time=3111] I suppose that some of you have heard of this person, but he'll never make baseball's Hall of Fame.
[time=3117] His name is Butch Wickensheimer.
[time=3119] Butch Wickensheimer was playing in Clinton, Iowa in the minor leagues in 1979.
[time=3126] He was a believer.
[time=3128] And as the other men on the minor league team watched him, they saw something different about Butch's life.
[time=3134] They were going, as they were going about traveling on the bus, going to the games, running around after the games at night, something was different about Butch's life.
[time=3144] Butch didn't run with the rest of the guys, but he wasn't offensive about it.
[time=3148] He was always godly and winsome and meek and gentle in his way.
[time=3153] Indeed, there was something attractive about this person.
[time=3157] He didn't try to shove his religion down anybody's throat.
[time=3161] He used his testimony, and if somebody came to him and asked him questions, he was always eager to offer what he believed the Bible taught about a certain thing.
[time=3171] Well, one of the men on the team that minor league year was Oral Hersheiser.
[time=3176] Oral would go on to be a tremendously successful Major League pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
[time=3182] What Oral writes in his book, "Out of the Blue," that there was something special, something especially attractive about Butch, and he said that he felt himself attracted to him for the person that he was.
[time=3194] Something was different.
[time=3196] He was very unassuming, very humble.
[time=3199] Oral became so attracted to the man's godliness that he said he eventually asked if Butch could be his roommate.
[time=3206] He wanted to have the opportunity to pepper Butch with questions and challenge him about the Christian faith.
[time=3212] Oral writes that as the season went on, he would have times when he would run with the other guys and do all the things that the guys did on the road.
[time=3218] But then he would come back and gravitate back toward Butch, and he kind of lived in both worlds.
[time=3225] Oral writes in his book that as time went on, he saw in Butch something that he knew he didn't have, something that he knew that he needed.
[time=3234] And one night after some of their times together, Oral Hersheiser got down on his knees and trusted Christ as his Savior and Lord.
[time=3242] Trusted in him, giving his heart to Jesus Christ.
[time=3246] You know, Butch didn't take any credit for that.
[time=3249] Butch gave all the glory to God.
[time=3251] But you see, a chain reaction was taking place.
[time=3255] Because what was happening was this.
[time=3258] As the soul of the earth and the light of the world.
[time=3261] Butch was going out and testifying and by his example, he was attempting to bring glory not to himself, but glory only to God.
[time=3271] And as the chain of events went on, as time went on and as Oral came to Jesus Christ, then Oral too could go and give glory to Jesus Christ.
[time=3281] Jesus says the purpose is to give glory to God.
[time=3286] And then to lead others into the same commitment so that they too in turn can give
[time=3292] honor and glory to God.
[time=3295] You know, we all have spiritual gifts and Butch Wickensheimer had his.
[time=3301] Oral Hersheiser has his today.
[time=3303] Butch will never make it to the Major League Hall of Fame.
[time=3309] Butch will never sign a $2.7 million dollar a year contract like Oral Hersheiser.
[time=3314] But everything that he does, he does to the honor and glory of God.
[time=3319] And because of that, he has led other men to Jesus Christ and they in turn have given Jesus Christ the glory.
[time=3326] That's the purpose.
[time=3327] That's the purpose of all that we are to say and all that we are to do by our example and by the things that we say we are to give the honor and glory to Christ.
[time=3338] There are us, all of us here today that our believers have spiritual gifts.
[time=3342] The Bible teaches that this Holy Spirit has gifted us.
[time=3346] And some of us have various gifts.
[time=3348] Some are able to communicate the gospel well.
[time=3351] Others have gifts of one-on-one evangelism.
[time=3354] But all of us have a spiritual gift.
[time=3356] And some of us here today have many.
[time=3359] Jesus says that we are to get off the sidelines.
[time=3361] We are to be the salt of the earth, the light of the world.
[time=3365] And that we are to use our influence for Jesus Christ.
[time=3369] In closing this morning, let me just once again go back to the beginning of the message when I said this.
[time=3375] That today in our world we are bombarded by the media and by books.
[time=3380] Telling us to use our influence for our own gain.
[time=3384] To use our influence that we can to build up power and prestige and a large bank
[time=3390] account that we might have influence over others and power over them.
[time=3394] Power that will help us to gain in this life.
[time=3398] But Jesus says I want you to be an influence.
[time=3401] But not the type of influence that the media would tell us to be.
[time=3404] But the type of influence that acts as the salt of the earth, the light of the world, goes out into a world that is spoiling and is corrupt.
[time=3412] And as the salt and light we are to retard the spoilage, retard the corruption.
[time=3417] And we are to be the salt and the light that leads others to honor and glorify
[time=3423] God.
[time=3424] In just a few moments we will be singing a hymn of invitation.
[time=3428] As we do that, perhaps you're here today.
[time=3431] You've never trusted Christ as your Savior.
[time=3433] You've never had a chance to be salt and light because you've never made a commitment to Jesus Christ.
[time=3439] In just a few moments we are going to give you an opportunity to do just that.
[time=3443] Perhaps you're here today and you're a believer but you've never really been the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[time=3449] You've never really actively gone in and watched as you went about your daily life
[time=3455] to be the salt and the light.
[time=3457] Perhaps you're a believer and you've allowed your witness to be contaminated.
[time=3461] You've allowed your salt to be contaminated and perhaps you have figured you're no longer of any use.
[time=3467] Jesus says you can be of use to my kingdom today.
[time=3471] This morning it has been our pleasure to enjoy the sanctuary choir and also a solo
[time=3481] by Denise Mitchell.
[time=3483] As always it has been a privilege to share God's word with you this morning.
[time=3487] If as a result of the message this morning you have sense to need in your heart to trust Christ as your Savior, why not pray with me right now?
[time=3494] As I lead you in this prayer.
[time=3496] Father indeed I sense that I need to receive your son as my Savior and as my
[time=3502] Lord.
[time=3503] I write at this moment repent of my sins.
[time=3505] I pledge that I will try to turn to the best of my ability to turn away from my sins to serve Jesus Christ as my Lord and my Savior.
[time=3513] Jesus come into my heart now.
[time=3515] Save my soul.
[time=3517] Give me everlasting life and help me to serve you for the rest of the time that I have upon this earth in Christ's name.
