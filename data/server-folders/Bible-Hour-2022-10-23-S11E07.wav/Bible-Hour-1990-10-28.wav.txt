[time=149] Our response to people who sin against us has the potential of making us a greater sinner than day.
[time=158] Whether we respond by overcoming evil with good or returning evil for evil,
[time=164] we'll best reflect the very nature of our walk with God.
[time=169] Today we look at the Apostle Paul's instructions and his own example in responding to those who would sin against us.
[time=177] As we look together at Paul's prescription for peace in having toward others a healthy, responsible attitude.

[time=1908] - Thank you, Brian, for that very sincere ministry
[time=1929] and music, great theme, the cross of Jesus Christ in giving God the glory.
[time=1934] 25 years ago, I was a very young man, very, very young man.
[time=1940] (congregation laughing) I came from California for special evangelistic meetings in the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and at that time I met Charles Lake who was the evangelist for that series of meetings.
[time=1954] We had a great time of fellowship with the people in the church and also got to know one another and that was a great privilege for me to know a wonderful man of God such as Charles is.
[time=1965] Charles is now the pastor of the community church of Greenwood, Indiana, just south of Indianapolis and has been the pastor for about 13 years and has also started some satellite churches, five of them to be exact in the area and we just appreciate the hearing throughout the years of the ministry and growth of that church.
[time=1987] Before Charles comes to speak to us, he has such a beautiful family that I just think they should be introduced.
[time=1994] So Cara and Kim and Vicki Lake are sitting right in the center section here.
[time=1999] Would you stand?
[time=2000] And let's welcome them to Black Hawk Baptist Church, please.
[time=2003] (congregation applauding) We had a very good time with them last night
[time=2012] and it is a privilege for me to introduce Dr. Charles Lake to our congregation at a great first service and I'm looking forward and I'm hoping that your hearts are open to what he says and from God's word.
[time=2024] Let's welcome Pastor Lake to our pulpit, please.
[time=2026] (congregation applauding) - If you take your Bibles and turn with me to Paul's letter to the Philippians, Philippians chapter one.
[time=2039] While you're turning to that, let me say what a joy it is to be here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2046] The reputation of your church has been known by me for a number of years and it's always been such a positive one but I counted a real honor to share today with you.
[time=2058] It's good to be back with my friend Pete and to minister with him.
[time=2064] It's been a great deal of love and respect in my life for him through the years and I sense that very strongly and warmly here as I fellowship with you.
[time=2074] Pray that God will have something very special to say to each of us today from His word.
[time=2080] Beginning our reading with the 12th verse, concluding with verse 18.
[time=2084] I want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.
[time=2091] As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
[time=2102] Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.
[time=2111] It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry but others out of good will.
[time=2118] The latter do so in love knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
[time=2124] The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
[time=2135] But what does it matter?
[time=2138] The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached.
[time=2147] And because of this, I rejoice.
[time=2152] Have you ever been hurt by someone, someone who sinned against you, by perhaps betraying your confidence and fringing upon your trust, saying the unkind word that you did not deserve?
[time=2171] I'm confident that the answer from all of us would be yes.
[time=2176] But how did you respond?
[time=2179] In what way did you handle that sin
[time=2185] that was sinned against you?
[time=2187] You see, the reality is that if we are not careful, our response to those who sin against us can ultimately make us greater sinners than they.
[time=2202] The Apostle Paul was in a Roman prison suffering for his faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2210] He became aware that while he was there, the gospel was being preached in places that otherwise it would never have been declared.
[time=2220] And as a result, he was rejoicing in the Lord.
[time=2223] But at the same time, he was keenly aware that he had some carnal colleagues who were out taking advantage of his dilemma to make a name for themselves and to seek to inflict injury upon his own pain.
[time=2241] Perhaps they were preaching a gospel that Paul was not completely sympathetic with.
[time=2247] They were trying to make a name for themselves and to debase the reputation that Paul had as the great apostle.
[time=2256] Paul said it in a very pictorial way when in the King James, he says, in the 18th verse, they were supposing to add affliction to my bonds.
[time=2270] Now in the original language of the New Testament, that word affliction has a beautiful word picture in the Greek.
[time=2277] It could be translated friction.
[time=2281] It's a vivid picture of the friction that is produced by metal chains around a man's wrist or his ankles, wearing upon the flesh until it peels the flesh and goes to the blood to induce pain to the sufferer.
[time=2300] Paul said this is what my colleagues are seeking to do to me while I'm in prison.
[time=2307] Now immediately, Paul began to compliment the situation in which he found himself.
[time=2315] He weighed his alternatives.
[time=2317] And Paul quickly was convinced that he had one of two alternatives.
[time=2323] Either he could become angry and vengeful and seek to get revenge, or he could be loving.
[time=2330] And forgiving, turning the other cheek.
[time=2333] I want to suggest to you this morning that whenever any of us find ourselves in a similar situation, our alternatives are the same numerically.
[time=2345] We can either fight back, become bitter in our spirit and revengeful in our attitude.
[time=2354] Or like Christ and Paul, we can be forgiving and loving and demonstrate something of the very attitude of Christ.
[time=2365] And so Paul weighed the alternatives and he made his choice deliberately.
[time=2371] And Paul chose to forgive those that were so obviously sinning against him.
[time=2377] Let's look at those two alternatives for just a moment.
[time=2381] Revenge, forgiveness.
[time=2385] When I think of revenge, I think of an Old Testament story.
[time=2388] It's found in the book of Genesis chapter 50.
[time=2392] Now most of us know that the last 13 chapters of the book of Genesis revolves around the story of one family, the family of a man named Jacob.
[time=2401] Jacob had 12 sons, 11 of which were jealous of the younger son, Joseph.
[time=2408] And one day they exercise their jealousy toward their younger brother by casting him into a pit to leave him to die.
[time=2418] When all of a sudden it came to their discovery that there was a better way.
[time=2422] They could profit from his demise.
[time=2425] And so rather than killing him, they sold him into Egyptian bondage and slavery.
[time=2431] And feeling that they had done away with him, they went back and lied to their father, saying that he was dead and their brother was no longer a part of their consideration.
[time=2445] But history tells us that time passed.
[time=2448] Circumstances in Israel became very stark.
[time=2451] Famine hit the land.
[time=2453] Israel was at a point of starvation.
[time=2456] And suddenly Jacob and the leaders of the land realized that the only place where there was food to satisfy their hunger was in Egypt.
[time=2467] And God gave them the instructions that they were to go to Egypt and ask for food and it would be well with them.
[time=2475] And when the brothers came into that land and found the one in charge of the food supply of Egypt, lo and behold, it was their brother, who had made the best of a bad situation, gained the confidence of the leaders of his land and had been elevated to second in the kingdom.
[time=2495] And they asked of their brother food and he gave them food in return.
[time=2503] That was around this same period in the story of this family that Dad died and left the sons to face the consequences of their own sin.
[time=2514] Let me pick up that story in the 50th chapter in the 15th verse.
[time=2518] Listen to it as I read it to you.
[time=2520] When Joseph's brother saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs that we did to him?" So they sent word to Joseph saying, "Before he died, your father left these instructions." This is what you're to say to Joseph, "I ask you to forgive your brothers for their sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly." Now please forgive the sins of your servants of God, of your father.
[time=2557] And when their message came to Joseph, Joseph wept.
[time=2562] Now listen to his response.
[time=2564] "And Joseph said unto them, 'Don't be afraid, am I in the place of God.' So then don't be afraid, I will provide for you and for your children." And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
[time=2582] Did you get to question the Joseph ask?
[time=2587] He said to his brothers, "If I were to hold a grudge and pay you back for the wrong that you have done to me, am I in the place of God?" You see Joseph understood that vengeance belongs to the Lord
[time=2604] and that if he were to seek to get even with his own brothers, he would put himself in God's place and he would play God.
[time=2618] Have you ever played God?
[time=2620] I have.
[time=2621] Come on, don't look so pious you have to.
[time=2626] All of us have.
[time=2627] At some time or the other, we have had that tremendous overwhelming sense to fight back, to get even, to become bitter, to stand as it were in the place of God and execute judgment upon those who sin against us.
[time=2646] Joseph said, "I won't make that mistake.
[time=2649] I won't play God." And I believe the same thoughts were in the mind of the great apostle.
[time=2657] And Paul said, "It is not mine to visit vengeance upon my colleagues who are seeking to take advantage of my dilemma.
[time=2666] Instead, I will forgive them and I will rejoice that the gospel of Jesus Christ is being preached." Now look for a moment at the demonstration of forgiveness in the life of Joseph.
[time=2681] Joseph said, "Not only be not afraid, I forgive." But Joseph said, "I will go beyond the spoken word and I will allow forgiveness to have legs on it.
[time=2694] I will allow forgiveness to bear flesh and do something in your time of need.
[time=2700] I will provide for you." And he spoke kindly to his brothers.
[time=2706] Something of the reflection of his faith began to manifest itself to those who had abused him.
[time=2715] And they saw something in Joseph that magnified the character of God in him.
[time=2722] Several years ago, I had a preacher friend well loved by his congregation who made a very foolish mistake in judgment.
[time=2734] It wasn't a moral issue in his life.
[time=2738] It was just that he didn't exercise good judgment in a situation.
[time=2744] As a result of that, five of his key laymen of his church suffered tremendous embarrassment.
[time=2750] When it was revealed and people knew that the issue was out and looked upon those five laymen and their embarrassment,
[time=2761] they began to be the taking of sides in the church and a divisive wedge began to be pounded in.
[time=2769] Four of those men got together.
[time=2773] They licked their wounds.
[time=2774] They bathed in their self-pity and they plotted how they might get even setting their pastor straight.
[time=2783] But one of them, a farmer, saw fit to respond with a spirit of forgiveness, the spirit of Christ, being a farmer and being the time of harvest.
[time=2797] He knew that his pastor loved the fresh fruits and of the harvest from the fields.
[time=2803] And so every day for two weeks, he went into the field with a grocery bag and picked fresh vegetables and filled up the bag and went home to his wife and she opened the freezer and they got out some fresh pieces of meat.
[time=2819] And in the dark of night in Cognito, he made his way to the pastor's home and left the nourishment at his door and slipped away so that the source would not be discovered.
[time=2833] And he did it for two solid weeks.
[time=2836] As he did that, the pastor began to realize the wrong that he'd done and feeling guilty wanted to go and make it right.
[time=2845] And he started by going one by one to each of the men that he had insulted, making an apology.
[time=2853] The first four that he came to received him into their homes and very grudgingly said, I'll forgive you, but it was a terrible thing that you did.
[time=2864] And he walked away with a sense of being forgiven but somehow knowing that those men would never forget.
[time=2872] He had lost their confidence forever.
[time=2875] He came to the home of the farmer, went in and sat down and started to apologize and said, I've done you a great injustice.
[time=2883] I need your forgiveness.
[time=2885] And before he could get through his little prepared speech, the farmer stopped him and said, wait a minute, you needn't go any further.
[time=2893] I forgave you the day it was first revealed.
[time=2897] I have no time for grudges.
[time=2898] I love you, pastor.
[time=2901] And God has forgiven me of so much.
[time=2903] How could I forgive, not forgive you of so little?
[time=2907] It's behind me, pastor.
[time=2909] I've already forgotten now you forget and let's move on.
[time=2913] Pastor said there for a moment in getting ready to leave, he said to the farmer, let me thank you for your forgiveness, for the way you've overlooked my injustice.
[time=2926] And before I go, I wanna thank you for the food too.
[time=2932] And the pastor looked for a moment and he said, who told you, did you see me one night as I tried to slip away?
[time=2939] No said the farmer, no said the preacher.
[time=2943] You just got through telling me.
[time=2946] Because in your response to my ill will, I've seen something of Christ in you.
[time=2954] And only someone like Christ would deliver groceries to the house of a man who had offended them.
[time=2962] Revenge, vengeance, bitterness of soul, always an alternative.
[time=2969] But how much more positive to extend the forgiveness of Christ that Christ is extended to us?
[time=2977] That as others look at us, they may not see us in all of our carnality, but to see us in our Christ likeness as we demonstrate something of the very nature of Christ to them.
[time=2991] But now before you leave that passage, there's two little practical suggestions that I think Paul leaves for us that we dare not overlook.
[time=3001] You find them in verse 18.
[time=3002] Paul summing up his situation raises a question.
[time=3008] What then, what shall I do?
[time=3010] Now those questions imply to me that Paul did not just simply react impetuously.
[time=3019] He didn't do that which just came naturally, but he waited over in order that he might deliberately respond to what these colleagues were doing to him.
[time=3033] Now that's a good bit of advice for all of us.
[time=3037] For you see, most of the time you and I react instead of responding.
[time=3044] We fly off the handle, we do what comes naturally and what comes naturally is what comes out of a nature that has been tainted by sin.
[time=3055] And we do things that often later we have to come back and repent of and sometimes end up becoming a greater sinner than those who have sinned against us.
[time=3067] When I was in school as a teenager, a popular song sang that message, doing what comes naturally.
[time=3076] But you see, we Christians don't live that way.
[time=3079] We wanna do what comes super naturally.
[time=3082] We wanna do what comes like Christ.
[time=3086] And so the next time somebody hurts you, they wound your pride or they do something that you don't rightly deserve.
[time=3096] Think of Paul who stopped for a moment and weighed the issue, wanting that his reaction be that which would be likened to Christ, deliberate, intentional, and when having manifested itself, never to be repented of because it was of God.
[time=3116] But the second thing he says in that verse is the important thing is, you see.
[time=3124] He not only determined what his response would be, but he did it on the basis of weighing the alternatives and wanting to see the most important result that could come to pass.
[time=3138] Now when it's you and when it's me, and we go through the process, what normally is the most important thing?
[time=3148] That when it's all over, I was right.
[time=3151] I won the battle, I deserve the credit.
[time=3156] I, I, I, looking out for number one.
[time=3161] But Paul said, friends, my vengeance, the vengeance of my own reputation pays in fail in significance to the growth and the extension of the kingdom of God.
[time=3177] And because Christ is being preached, whether the motives are pure or impure, that's the important thing.
[time=3186] And in that, I'm going to rejoice, and I'm going to keep on rejoicing.
[time=3192] I'll take that little principal home with you.
[time=3197] And you apply it the next time there's any tension, any disagreement between you and any other person, even the next time you have that little spat with the spouse.
[time=3209] And when you come to that disagreement, stop and ask deliberately, what then shall I do?
[time=3217] How then shall I respond?
[time=3219] How would Jesus respond?
[time=3222] What's the important thing?
[time=3225] Is it more important that I be right, that I win the argument, that I get the credit?
[time=3233] Or is it more important that our relationship of byad and harmony and unity and oneness to the glory of God?
[time=3244] I think if somehow we could grasp something of the magnanimous forgiving spirit of a loving Christ and begin to demonstrate that in all of human relationships in our home, in our church, in our business world, wherever we are, we'll show a watching world what it really means to be different in the person of the Lord Jesus, because we're manifesting the very essence of what it means to walk with the Lord.
[time=3275] I'm always enthralled by the bumper sticker that I see quite often on the backs of cars.
[time=3282] Christians aren't perfect, they're just forgiven.
[time=3287] I don't know about you, but I like that, because I know how imperfect I am, but I rejoice in the fact that I know in Christ I am forgiven.
[time=3297] But as I look at that, I am constantly reminded
[time=3303] that when my Lord taught the disciples to pray in what we call the Lord's prayer, the model prayer, there was only one petition that He chose to go back and reiterate or explain.
[time=3316] Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[time=3321] And Christ said, if you do not forgive those who sin against you, I'll not forgive your sins, but forgive them, and you'll experience my forgiveness in return.
[time=3335] Say, folks, one of the easiest ways to destroy our witnesses of Christians is to allow someone else's sin to make of us,
[time=3348] a greater sinner still, to bear a bitter attitude, to manifest an unforgiving spirit, to demonstrate a carnal nature that destroys the very witness of the love and the grace of God in the human heart.
[time=3367] The story is told of the days of the South, the days of segregation, when a black man wandered along the city streets on a Sunday morning, deciding momentarily that he would step in to the local Baptist church, white church, to worship.
[time=3387] Lo and behold, he was greeted by a white usher that welcomed him warmly, walked him down the aisle, seated him in the one of the best seats in the house, much to the chagrin and the amazement of an all-white audience.
[time=3399] All of them worshiped together, many people having a hard time worshiping, recognizing the dynamic that was occurring, but when it was over, they all stayed in their seats until the black man had been ushered out, and the usher had walked him to the door and he left in the distance.
[time=3418] That evening before church, there was a call meeting of the board of elders, and the usher was called on the carpet, saying to him, "Sir, do you not know that in this church, in this town, in this state, blacks and whites don't worship together?
[time=3434] What right had you to violate that principle and bring that brother into worship?" The young usher began to explain and he said very simply, I saw the man coming toward the church and there was such a sense of expectation written on his face that I knew he was coming to worship.
[time=3456] I deducted that if he really wanted to worship, it was very likely that he was born again and he knew my Lord and my Christ, and that would make him my brother.
[time=3468] And so he said, I simply felt I had no other choice, but to open the door and to welcome him and let him come in and enjoy our fellowship.
[time=3477] And seeing that he was not getting anywhere in his explanation, he concluded by saying, "Oh yes, and the thought came to me so strongly that Sunday both he and I would die and stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
[time=3492] And if he made it in and I made it in, what would happen if God called me to be an usher?
[time=3500] To extend the same grace of God, from the black man to the white as the white man to the black would make the difference.
[time=3511] For if God had called the black man to be an usher, he would have wanted the same response that had been given to him by his white brother.
[time=3522] That's the call of God to all of our hearts, to demonstrate his love, to show forgiveness, to walk the second mile, to turn the other cheek, to show in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, his love and forgiveness to all the world around us.
[time=3552] (gentle music) - We've been sharing with you the ministry of our sanctuary choir, The Men's Singers and soloist Brian Loessen.
[time=3564] The message today was from our guest pastor, Dr. Charles Lake, pastor of the Community Church of Greenwood, Indiana.
[time=3571] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3579] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3582] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3589] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3593] I ask you that you will forgive me of my sins and declines me and be my savior today.
[time=3599] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3602] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
