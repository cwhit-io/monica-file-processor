[time=111] When John Bunyan wrote Pilgrim's Progress, he was well aware that there were dangers along the Pilgrim's pathway.
[time=119] We need to know something about the perils of the Christian life.
[time=123] Christian life is not all strawberries and cream, there are problems, difficulties and dangers.
[time=129] If we're going to be victorious, we need to know something about them.
[time=133] [MUSIC]
[time=142] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=147] Thank you for joining us.
[time=149] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. John Balio, President of Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=156] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=161] Special music today includes a song by the Sanctuary Choir, a solo from Lisa Renicker, and a solo from Keith Brodiga.
[time=172] We now join our service with the selection by the Handbell Choir.
[time=176] [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=330] God be the glory, great things he has done, and certainly God has blessed us here at Blackhawk individually and as a church family and re-rejoice at that.
[time=339] The chorus on the screen is "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name."
[time=346] [MUSIC - 271 seconds]
[time=628] [APPLAUSE]
[time=633] Amen, what a joy to sing of the power of the Lord and then to sing with peace in our hearts and say it as well with my soul.
[time=641] He gives us the strength that we want and that we ask for and yet he also gives us the peace and time of need.
[time=647] This is a great hymn of the church, hymn number 493, sing it together, it is well with my soul verses 1 and 3.
[time=656] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=800] Amen, thank you for that glorious singing, we continue with music now, Lisa Reniker comes to minister to us in song right now.
[time=810] [MUSIC - 200 seconds]
[time=1030] Welcome to the Bible Hour today, thank you for tuning in. This has been a special week, last week we talked to you about a special concert entitled Exaltation. It was a joint choir and orchestra concert with the East Side Church of God in Anderson, Indiana. We had a wonderful time exulting the name of the Lord through music and the word last Sunday evening. It was a great time of fellowship.
[time=1055] I also want to thank many of you for writing this week and telling us that you're watching the Bible Hour. Some of you also wrote and said that you were unable to attend your church because of illness, and I'm glad that we could fill that void in your spiritual life by allowing you to worship with us through the Bible Hour. Thank you very much for telling us that you did worship with us, we appreciate that.
[time=1077] If you're a member of the Founders Club, you received a letter recently, and in that letter there was a form for living Christmas tree tickets. I know that it's very early, but we need to get that form out to you so that you can return it to us in plenty of time to have good selection for the day and the date that you'd like to come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=1097] If you've not filled out that form, please make it a point this week to fill it out with your choice of the concert you'd like to attend, and then send it back to us so that we can send you the tickets.
[time=1107] We had a retreat with our choir this last weekend on Friday and Saturday, and we began practicing the Christmas music, and there's some wonderful pieces you will enjoy the Christmas tree this year entitled "An Evening in December."
[time=1123] We've been talking for a number of weeks now at Blackhawk Baptist Church about our building program. It's entitled "A Blueprint for Building Lives."
[time=1131] We are endeavoring right now to raise funds to build a new gymnasium in 10 classrooms to expand our Sunday school program in our Christian school, and we've gathered together in one service here just to have a celebration and thank the Lord for the growth of our Sunday school program and our Christian school, so I'm glad that you're joining with us today.
[time=1152] We have a wonderful special guest today. He's a great friend of mine. He comes all the way from Salem, Oregon at Dr. John Ballio. Good morning, Dr. Ballio.
[time=1161] Morning, Pete. How are you today?
[time=1163] I'm just fine. Thank you. Western Baptist College has a great warm spot in my heart as I spent five years there teaching in the music department, and Dr. Ballio, you're the president of Western Baptist College.
[time=1177] Tell us a little bit about the school and some of the thrusts of that, or good organization.
[time=1182] Well, Pete, we miss your great deal out at Western. You know, I never really forgave you for leaving us, but we're glad you're here, of course, involved in a great ministry.
[time=1191] There are some very great distinctives in a Christian college. For one thing, you just live in a Christian college in an accepting environment.
[time=1199] We're concerned about the emotional development of our kids, and there's a great, friendly Christian atmosphere on campus, and it's great to see them come in with a lot of insecurity sometimes, various backgrounds, and emotionally mature, and this is a great advantage in a Christian college.
[time=1217] Also, as a matter of moral development, we have to fortify these kids to face a very, very tough world. It's a world of temptation and difficulty, and we're interested in character building, and certainly with Christian values and Christian teaching, that happens.
[time=1234] And then, of course, we're interested in the spiritual development of our kids that they develop a very close, intimate, meaningful relationship with Jesus Christ that's going to fortify them for all the days to come and for their engagement in Christian ministry.
[time=1249] You understand, of course, we're both a liberal arts college and a Bible college, so we're preparing young people for the business world, the marketplace, as well as full-time Christian service.
[time=1259] Well, that's wonderful. Western Baptist College, while it's a long ways away in Salem, Oregon, I don't have any hesitation to recommend any young person that might be watching today to consider Western Baptist College for a great education.
[time=1273] My daughter graduated from there, my son-in-law graduated from Western, and is now in seminary, and we just have a very high regard for Western Baptist College, and we're glad that you're here, Dr. Balyo, joining with us today.
[time=1286] And just a few minutes, Dr. Balyo will be speaking in our service, and we're going to go back to our live broadcast very soon.
[time=1293] Just before we do, however, I've been mentioning the last couple weeks, a book entitled Answers to Life's Questions.
[time=1300] Billy Graham had a radio program for years that was called The Answer, and he's taken many of the biblical questions that were asked of him and put it together in this book.
[time=1310] There are five parts to the book. The first one is relationships, spiritual concerns, psychological problems, ethical issues, and biblical questions.
[time=1320] All of the answers based on the authority of the Word of God. This is a great book for Answers for Life's Problems, and we'd like to send it to you today, absolutely free.
[time=1331] You can receive this book by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1342] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1351] Once again, it's a pleasure to thank you for joining with us today in the fellowship that we have on the Bible Hour.
[time=1358] I hope that the music and the message today is a real source of inspiration to you. We go back now to music and then the message from our guest, Dr. John Balyo.
[time=1370] Lord, I just want to praise your name and worship you today because you are our mighty fortress. In times of trouble and uncertainty in our world, you are the strong fortress, the unmovable God that we can worship.
[time=1385] Lord, help us to honor that by our giving today. Help us not to be infected with apathy and complacency as we look ahead at our future, as we look ahead at our building program, and as we give to your ministry at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1400] Thank you Father for your blessings upon us. This thing is a praying Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1415] Oh, save to the right that is higher than I. My soul in its conflict and sorrows would lie.
[time=1441] So sinful, so weary.
[time=1447] And I, would I be a blessed rock of angels.
[time=1459] I'm hiding me, hiding me, hiding me, hiding me.
[time=1504] I'm hiding me, hiding me, hiding me, hiding me, hiding me, hiding me, hiding me.
[time=1528] I'm hiding me, hiding me, hiding me, hiding me.
[time=1550] I'm hiding my soul in the life of the rock that saddles to try most in love.
[time=1566] I'm hiding my life in the life of the rock and covers me there with his hand.
[time=1584] And covers me there with his hand.
[time=1595] I'm hiding me, hiding me, hiding me.
[time=1606] I'm hiding me, hiding me.
[time=1634] Keith just spoke of the safety and the rock of our Lord Jesus Christ in hiding in Him.
[time=1642] And while we enjoy this service, Mrs. Plummer, who is J. Hall's grandmother, had a severe stroke and is not expected to live.
[time=1650] And S.E. York is very ill with cancer and is not expected to live through the day.
[time=1655] And perhaps there are people here today that just have some real hurts.
[time=1658] And we're glad you're here because we hope that this will be a spiritual medicine that will strengthen you today and heal your spiritual lives.
[time=1667] And I want to bow right now and just pray for these two ladies and others that might have needs and ask the Lord to intercede in their behalf right now.
[time=1677] Father, how thankful we are to come before you and to realize that you do hide us in the rock and that you provide a shelter.
[time=1684] And these two ladies are very, very ill right now and we pray that you will just comfort them and their families and give them sustaining power to go through this trying time.
[time=1694] We pray for J. Hall and his family that you will just strengthen them and give them the peace that you promised to give in these circumstances.
[time=1701] And also with S.E. she's been such a faithful warrior and she's been a real, real instrument of truth and been a real faithful person to tell that God loves her and that God has a plan for her life and he's carrying out that plan.
[time=1720] What a privilege it is to meet with somebody and realize that they say God has given me a wonderful life and I'm ready to meet him.
[time=1728] I hope that we can all say that in this building today, Lord, that we know you as personal Savior and that we're ready when it's your time to take us to see you.
[time=1737] That we'll serve you faithfully here until that time and be thankful that you give us days of longevity here and we pray that we'll use it wisely and serve you well.
[time=1748] Thank you for this service. Thank you for our family of believers at Black Hawk. We love them.
[time=1753] And we are just so grateful for their dedication in Sunday school and in Wanna and Super Sixties and in the choir and in the nursery and ushering in other aspects of our ministry that go unnoticed.
[time=1766] Lord, just encourage them and we thank you for everyone that gets involved and serves you at our church.
[time=1773] Bless the rest of our service, bless the preaching from Dr. Valleau that your name will be honored in Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[time=1782] Well, it's a privilege again today to introduce to you our guest speaker.
[time=1786] Dr. John Valleau is formerly from this area. He pastored in Kokomo and in Cleveland, Ohio and was a professor at Grand Rapids Baptist College for a number of years.
[time=1796] And back in about 1983 he accepted the call to become the president of Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1804] There are some marvelous and very great people that graduated from Western Baptist College, my daughter, my son-in-law, and there are a couple others that just have graduated from that school.
[time=1818] I loved my time at Western before I came to Blackhawk. I taught there for five years, a wonderful school of the liberal arts and Bible training.
[time=1829] And we have some many friends there that love the Lord and are serving out there and Dr. Valleau has done a magnificent job as president of that school for seven plus years.
[time=1840] And we're delighted that he's back in the Midwest and in particular at Blackhawk Baptist Church. Would you welcome him to our pulpit, Dr. John Valleau?
[time=1857] It is a pleasure to be back in the Midwest. I said when I moved to Salem, Oregon, I never dreamed I'd live so far away from everywhere.
[time=1864] But it is a beautiful country and we're delighted to be there. I'm glad to be back here and meet some old friends and meet some new friends as well.
[time=1873] Keith Brodigan, I've known he was at Grand Rapids when I was teaching in the seminary there.
[time=1880] If I could sing like Keith Brodigan, I would.
[time=1887] I didn't always know I couldn't sing.
[time=1891] It was a great day for me and a lot of other people when I found out I couldn't.
[time=1897] I went to see a man who was ill once and decided I'd cheer him up, so I sang to him.
[time=1903] And when I finished I said, "I hope you get better." He said, "You too."
[time=1913] I appreciate this magnificent music at Blackhawk. Lisa Solo touches your heart and thrills you aesthetically as well.
[time=1922] It's great choir. It's just a tremendous blessing to be in this congregation since the presence of the Spirit of God.
[time=1929] We're trusting the Spirit of God to guide us today that we might be helped and encouraged.
[time=1934] I'm talking about some of the perils of the Christian life.
[time=1938] Not going to try to mention all of them. I want you to have the pleasure of discovering some of them yourself.
[time=1944] But just some of the perils along the way of the Christian life.
[time=1948] Number one, the peril of an undisciplined life.
[time=1951] Some people, unfortunately, some Christians sort of take life like a stroll in the woods.
[time=1958] They aren't going anywhere in particular. They're just wandering around.
[time=1964] You realize it takes some discipline in order to grow in the spiritual life. It doesn't just happen.
[time=1971] It does not occur simply because of the passing of time or the passing of years. It takes discipline.
[time=1978] You need certainly to give some time and study to the matter of your own spiritual growth.
[time=1985] Now I'm not talking about morbid introspection.
[time=1988] I am talking about some good, sane, self-evaluation. We do need to do that.
[time=1996] You need to know where you are in your Christian life.
[time=1998] The Apostle Paul wrote to young Timothy and he said, "Take heed to yourself. We need to do that."
[time=2004] Where am I spiritually?
[time=2007] Galatians 5 might be a good place to start the evaluation. You know the fruit of the Spirit is there.
[time=2012] Fruit of Spirit is love. You have it. Manifesting it. Joy, peace, long-suffering of patience,
[time=2021] gentleness, or it could be translated kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control.
[time=2031] Not a bad thing to go back to Galatians 5 and look at the fruit of the Spirit and say, "Am I manifesting the fruit of the Spirit? Take heed to yourself." Paul said to Timothy,
[time=2042] "We need to do that." Then you need discipline in order to implement your decisions.
[time=2050] Disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane were told by Christ to pray.
[time=2054] Now Luke tells us their eyes were heavy. They had been a fatiguing week.
[time=2058] They were tired. They were sleepy. And when they were sleeping, tired, fatigued, he said, "I want you to pray. Pray with me." They didn't do it. Christ came back and he said to them,
[time=2071] "The Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Now he wasn't saying, "Give in to the weak flesh."
[time=2078] Because again he told them to pray. What he was saying was, "Put the willing Spirit in the driver's seat and drive the weak flesh."
[time=2089] If you just do what you feel like doing, you won't be a very good Christian.
[time=2095] You need discipline in order to pray. You have to find a time, a place.
[time=2101] I'm not talking about not fellowship in the Lord during the day, but you need to start the day that takes discipline.
[time=2108] You need discipline in the matter of Christian service. If you only serve Christ when you feel like it, you don't do enough.
[time=2116] You need discipline in the matter of faith. You don't always feel like trusting God.
[time=2120] I've said to the Lord, "Hid times, Lord, I don't feel like trusting you, but I will decide to do it." Emotionally, I'm down. But I will exercise faith when I don't feel right or feel like trusting.
[time=2133] Discipline. Take heed to yourself. Paul also said to Timothy, "Take heed to your teaching."
[time=2139] He was pastoring in Ephesus, and he had to study the word and then teach the word.
[time=2145] Study is discipline, is a matter of work.
[time=2150] Now, I recognize, you know, I work with college students all the time.
[time=2153] The very word "work" gives some people chills and fevers. I understand that.
[time=2158] But it is necessary that we work, and learning the word of God takes perspiration.
[time=2165] Now, you need to do it. You know, you learn the word in church.
[time=2170] You come and the chef, who is the pastor, is feeding you.
[time=2173] But you need a lot of home-cooked meals.
[time=2175] That you're studying the word at home, diligently, and growing in grace.
[time=2180] You need that. That's just Word.
[time=2183] Pataresque had a command performance before Queen Victoria.
[time=2188] And she was so impressed at the end of the concert.
[time=2191] She just impossibly exclaimed, "Pataresque, you're a genius."
[time=2198] And he responded, "That may be so, but before I was a genius, I was a drudge."
[time=2206] He knew what it was to work. Hard, hard work.
[time=2211] Well, there's not only the parallel and undisciplined life.
[time=2214] There's the parallel discouragement.
[time=2217] Every Christian faces that at times.
[time=2222] And it's also certainly a tool of the enemy.
[time=2226] We know what it is to be discouraged.
[time=2228] Sometimes we're discouraged by opposition.
[time=2232] I used to think that the narrow road that leads to life and to heaven
[time=2238] was alongside the broad road that leads to destruction or what Shakespeare called the everlasting bonfire.
[time=2247] I know better now.
[time=2250] The narrow road is right in the middle of the broad road and most of the traffic is going in the other direction.
[time=2258] So as we are going uphill against the oncoming traffic, we will meet opposition every Christian does.
[time=2268] I'll pass upon you about that. He was on a missionary journey.
[time=2273] He had been beaten and jailed in Philippi.
[time=2277] There was a riot in Thessalonica.
[time=2280] He fled by night to Berea.
[time=2282] There were more noble there and response was better.
[time=2285] But he had trouble in Berea in opposition.
[time=2289] Then he went to Athens and was ridiculed by the philosophers in Athens.
[time=2294] And now he's at Corinth.
[time=2297] He has done some preaching, but he quits and he's discouraged.
[time=2303] How do you know that?
[time=2305] Well, I know it because God appears to him at a vision and he says, "Stop being afraid," which means he was.
[time=2313] He says, "Speak whole not by peace," which means he was tempted to hold his peace and not to speak.
[time=2321] And Lord said, "I'm with you." He's encouraging Paul.
[time=2325] He said, "No man shall set on thee to hurt thee." Paul might have said, "Well, I'll be different." That'll be different. He said, "I have much people in this city." A lot of people are going to respond to the gospel.
[time=2337] God was encouraged, encouraging a discouraged missionary.
[time=2343] Paul knew what it was to be down in the dumps.
[time=2347] By the way, I heard about a woman who said, "When I'm down in the dumps, I always buy a new dress." And her husband said, "I always wondered where you got those things." Yeah.
[time=2365] Great prophet of fire Elijah in the Old Testament was so discouraged, he said he wanted to die.
[time=2370] I think he had ambivalent feelings.
[time=2372] He wanted to die and he didn't want to die.
[time=2375] Maybe he felt a little bit like Tom Sawyer.
[time=2377] He said he wished he was temporarily dead.
[time=2382] Wouldn't that be nice?
[time=2384] I don't want to be permanent, just temporarily dead.
[time=2388] Be out of it for a while.
[time=2390] Well, we've all been there and we need God's encouragement, the encouragement of Christian friends, the encouragement of the Word of God.
[time=2397] God wants us to be up.
[time=2402] We need our emotions bolstered and God understands that.
[time=2408] Sometimes we're discouraged by criticism.
[time=2412] And every Christian who is doing anything is going to find some criticism.
[time=2419] Dr. Clovis Chappell was a fine evangelical Methodist preacher.
[time=2424] He was passing a church in the Southland.
[time=2427] And he said he got a letter one day.
[time=2430] Sometimes Christian workers get those letters that are very critical and pretty hot.
[time=2436] Dr. Chappell said the letter was so hot he said he should have been written on asbestos.
[time=2443] He said in fact it was so hot he said I wonder how it got through the post office without burning the building down.
[time=2450] So he said I read the letter and as I read it.
[time=2454] I said you know this man is trying to get out of my skin.
[time=2458] Now he said I'm already under my skin.
[time=2461] He said there's not room for two of us under my skin.
[time=2464] He said I'm not going to let this letter bother me.
[time=2469] Now he said at the time I'm telling you this I can't remember the man's name who wrote
[time=2475] it nor what was contained in the letter.
[time=2479] Now obviously if this criticism leveled at you that you can profit by you ought to do
[time=2485] it so you need to evaluate it.
[time=2487] There may be something that is constructive in it.
[time=2491] If there isn't anything constructive if it is simply a put down then simply do what
[time=2498] the moon does when a dog barks at it.
[time=2502] Just keep on shining and don't let it bother you.
[time=2507] Dr. Walter Wilson now with the Lord medical doctor turned preacher founded a Bible Institute
[time=2513] in Kansas City.
[time=2514] He said when he was just a boy that a neighbor said to his mother said I don't think Walter
[time=2520] is a Christian and Walter and mother told him.
[time=2525] He said Mrs. So and so doesn't think you're Christian and how would you respond to that?
[time=2531] You're just a boy, immature.
[time=2534] Would you say hey tell old Wendy she don't know what she's talking about?
[time=2537] Would you get angry?
[time=2538] Would you be mad?
[time=2541] Walter went upstairs and helped by his bed and said Lord help me to so live that nobody
[time=2547] ever questions my Christianity again.
[time=2551] He profited by what probably was negative criticism.
[time=2558] Sometimes we're discouraged by frustration.
[time=2562] That bothers me at time.
[time=2564] I like to see things move.
[time=2565] I want them to happen.
[time=2566] You know it's either today or yesterday but don't put it off until tomorrow.
[time=2570] Let's see things happen and move.
[time=2573] I'm frustrated at times when things don't move as they should.
[time=2579] Every Christian understands that.
[time=2581] I heard about a man once who was very frustrated, upset and a friend was trying to calm him down,
[time=2587] console him and encourage him and he said well you know Rome wasn't built in a day.
[time=2591] He said yeah I know but I wasn't on that job.
[time=2596] It wouldn't have mattered if he had been on that job, it wouldn't have been built in a day.
[time=2603] Philip's Brooks famous preacher was agitated pacing back and forth in his study and again a friend tried to help him and he said what's wrong Philip?
[time=2612] And he said oh he said I'm in a hurry but God isn't.
[time=2619] And sometimes it seems like God isn't in any hurry.
[time=2623] I was going through the Psalms and noticed David's prayers and petitions to the Lord and sometimes he would say things like this.
[time=2631] Hayson thou O Lord.
[time=2633] Sometimes you'd say awaken thou O Lord.
[time=2637] Can you imagine telling God to wake up and hurry up?
[time=2640] But you understand it seems at times that God is asleep or at least that he's not doing anything.
[time=2647] God knows what he's doing.
[time=2649] He has his own timetable and there are times when we need to be patient with God.
[time=2655] God will do what he ought to do when he ought to do it.
[time=2659] Paul said he wanted to go to Rome.
[time=2661] He said he purposed time and again to go and couldn't.
[time=2666] Was forbidden, hindered by Satan he said.
[time=2669] In God's time he went.
[time=2672] In God's time.
[time=2674] Then there's the imbalance, the peril of imbalance in your schedule.
[time=2677] We all have trouble with that don't we?
[time=2680] Time management?
[time=2682] We can go in two different directions.
[time=2686] You know too much time off.
[time=2690] Lot said in Proverbs by the way about laziness and loafing.
[time=2694] Lot said in Proverbs.
[time=2696] I heard about a teenager who took an aptitude test and they discovered he was suitable only for retirement.
[time=2705] Well we can't have too much time off just killing time which means killing life.
[time=2710] Because time is life we need to be busy.
[time=2714] The opposite of that of course is too little time off.
[time=2718] There are workaholics and that's the other extreme and it's not good.
[time=2723] I've preached sermons for a number of people going into ministry ordination messages and I've said to the candidate take time for your family and your children.
[time=2734] Please, please don't make your wife a widow and your children orphans while you're still alive.
[time=2741] You need to tend your own garden.
[time=2744] You know I've heard it said and people have said to me that well you know the devil never takes a vacation.
[time=2750] The implication is that you're not either and my response to that is simply he's not my example.
[time=2756] I'm not following him, I'm following Jesus and he said to his disciples come ye apart and rest of while.
[time=2764] We need those times of relaxation for self-renewal and for family.
[time=2771] David Brainerd was a great preacher.
[time=2774] I read his journal his missionary to the Indians.
[time=2778] Very fervent, fervent in prayer, fervent in preaching.
[time=2781] One many many Indians to Christ.
[time=2785] Trouble was he drove himself unmercifully, burned himself out, died at the age of 29.
[time=2794] Before he died he said God gave me a horse to ride and a message to deliver.
[time=2802] He said now I have killed a horse and I can't deliver the message.
[time=2808] God wants us to take care of our bodies because it's with our bodies that we serve Christ.
[time=2818] Also there's the peril of inflexibility or compromise.
[time=2824] Those are the two extremes.
[time=2827] Regidity is not a sign of spirituality.
[time=2833] If you have no give, you have no grace.
[time=2838] The book of Philippians, by the way it was appalling church there in Philippi.
[time=2842] The Apostle Paul said submit yourselves to one another.
[time=2846] That's what they weren't doing.
[time=2849] You know we need to give in to each other at times.
[time=2853] I'm not talking about sacrificing truth.
[time=2856] I'm not talking about compromising when it comes to sacrificing doctrine or morality.
[time=2863] But there is a rigidity that's really fair circle.
[time=2866] You know there was no bend to the Pharisees.
[time=2869] They're very very rigid.
[time=2873] We need to be able to give.
[time=2875] I've said you know wives need time to submit to husbands.
[time=2878] Husbands sometimes need to give them to wives.
[time=2881] It does work both ways.
[time=2883] Submitting to one another is the way to live graciously and spiritually.
[time=2890] Well the opposite of course of inflexibility is compromise.
[time=2897] Some things are not negotiable.
[time=2900] We don't give an inch on the truth of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2906] His deity, His sinlessness, His death on Calvary's cross for our sins by which we're saved and sins are forgiven.
[time=2914] No no negotiable when it comes to the resurrection of Christ is coming in or the inheritance of Scripture.
[time=2921] These are not negotiable.
[time=2923] Some things you don't give in on.
[time=2927] It's easy sometimes because there is pressure and opposition to dip the flag in compromise.
[time=2935] Charlie Brown you do some deep reading here do you not?
[time=2939] You read Peanuts by Charles Scholz.
[time=2943] Charlie Brown announced to Lucy that when he grew up he wanted to be a fanatic.
[time=2948] And she said what kind of fanatic?
[time=2951] He said I wish you are she fanatic.
[time=2955] I'm afraid we have enough of those around.
[time=2960] Paul said he once whispered Peter to the face for he was to be blamed.
[time=2965] Peter was compromising the gospel by his behavior.
[time=2969] And Paul said I wish stood him publicly that is to the face.
[time=2974] No compromise when he comes to the Word of God and to the gospel.
[time=2980] Edmund Burke once said all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.
[time=2987] See apathy can be compromised.
[time=2990] Just don't do anything and let evil triumph.
[time=2997] Then there's the peril of callousness.
[time=3002] I don't know about you but I find that unless I pray about people and keep my heart warm to the Lord that I become increasingly selfish and it doesn't bother me
[time=3013] that there are a lot of hurting people out there.
[time=3017] You know we get used to people hurting and crying and dying and doesn't really bother us.
[time=3025] Lucy had one of these big bean bags you know the kind you can sink down into.
[time=3032] She said a bean bag is a good place to suck.
[time=3036] She said you can sink way down deep in it and just rise up once in a while to see if anybody cares.
[time=3048] And there are an awful lot of people out there wondering if anybody cares.
[time=3054] I'm not at all sure that people are going to be greatly impressed with our message if it's not accompanied by compassion and concern.
[time=3064] You know God so loved the world.
[time=3066] It wasn't the likeable world.
[time=3068] It was an unlikable world.
[time=3070] It was a sinful or a wicked world.
[time=3072] The world gone astray.
[time=3074] God loved that kind of work.
[time=3077] He cared about it and sacrificed for it.
[time=3081] We talk about being Christ-like.
[time=3083] Well this is what Christ was like.
[time=3085] Sacra, fish of love. God expects us certainly to care.
[time=3093] Trouble with the elder brother when the prodigal came home was he was simply cynical and unhappy because somebody repented his own brother and was back home.
[time=3104] It's not enough to condemn sin.
[time=3106] We have to love sinners and Christian brothers.
[time=3111] You know the Bible tells us to pray for all saints?
[time=3114] That's in the book of Ephesians.
[time=3116] Chapter 6, everybody, all saints.
[time=3118] You mean saints I don't like?
[time=3120] Especially the saints you don't like.
[time=3124] God expects us to care.
[time=3127] Joe Bailey, distinguished writer, a man who personally has gone through a lot of heartache and sorrow.
[time=3138] He wrote a book of Psalms, present-day Psalms.
[time=3143] I'm going to read one of them.
[time=3146] I'm not sure whether this came out of some personal experience or not because I'm sure some of his Psalms did because he was a man who knew what hurt was.
[time=3155] Maybe it's something he wrote because he is sensitive to people who are hurting and he understands.
[time=3161] He calls this one a Psalm in a hotel room.
[time=3168] I'm alone Lord, alone.
[time=3173] A thousand miles from home.
[time=3176] There's no one here who knows my name except the clerk and he spelled it wrong.
[time=3181] No one did dinner with?
[time=3183] Laugh at my jokes, listen to my gripes, be happy with me about what happened today and say that's great.
[time=3193] No one cares.
[time=3196] There's just this lousy bed and slush in the street outside between the buildings.
[time=3203] I feel sorry for myself and I plenty of reason to.
[time=3207] Maybe I ought to say I'm on top of it, praise the Lord.
[time=3216] But he says there things aren't great tonight, it's all gray slush.
[time=3227] And for a lot of people, right now it's all gray slush and they need us to care.
[time=3239] They desperately need us to care.
[time=3244] Then there's also the parallel pride.
[time=3248] Did you know that pride is worldliness?
[time=3252] John talks about worldliness, his little epistle first John, and he calls it the lust of the desire of the eyes, the desire of the flesh, and the pride of life.
[time=3264] Pride is being worldly.
[time=3267] However, it has become, I guess, a pretty respectable sin.
[time=3273] Now I'm not talking about the sense of self-worth and self-respect, that's vastly different.
[time=3280] And if you take joy and accomplishment by God's grace and strength, that's not pride, I'm not talking about that.
[time=3288] I'm talking about despising others and looking down upon others, thinking more highly of yourself than you ought to think is the apostle Paul put it.
[time=3295] Paul had trouble with it, you know.
[time=3298] All kinds of pride, pride of face, pride of race, pride of grace.
[time=3302] Apostle Paul had trouble with a ladder.
[time=3305] He said, "God gave me a thorn in the flesh, lest I should be exalted above measure because of the abundance of revelation God has given me."
[time=3314] He said, "God has so blessed me.
[time=3318] I'm tempted to be proud, and God has humbled me and kept me humble by a thorn in the flesh." If the apostle Paul had trouble with it, we do too.
[time=3330] Sometimes we're proud of what we know.
[time=3333] Bible says knowledge puffs up.
[time=3336] Bible knowledge not applied in practice can also puff you up.
[time=3340] You can be very, very proud of what you know in Scripture.
[time=3343] Applied Scripture, of course, will humble you.
[time=3347] Sometimes we're proud of what we've done, what we've accomplished.
[time=3351] Samson killed a lion and told nobody about it, and we kill a mouse and it shows up in the Baptist bullet.
[time=3360] What we've done.
[time=3364] Sometimes we're proud of what notoriety we have obtained, where we are positionally.
[time=3373] Humpty dumped is set on a wall.
[time=3376] You know, that's a strange place for an egg to be, given its shape and all.
[time=3381] Very precarious place for an egg to be.
[time=3383] Why in the world would an egg want to be on a wall?
[time=3386] Well, an egg on a wall is prominent, it is visible.
[time=3390] An egg in a nest is not, it's obscure, it's not easily seen.
[time=3393] You've got to look for it, right?
[time=3396] I'm not surprised that Humpty dumped it, fell off the wall and became a scrambled egg.
[time=3401] I mean, that was to be expected.
[time=3404] Do you know that Christ said if you climb up on a wall you get pushed off?
[time=3409] You say, "Where's that in the Bible?" Well, of course it stated differently, isn't it?
[time=3414] He said, "If you exalt yourself, you will be humbled.
[time=3417] If you humble yourself, you will be exalted.
[time=3420] If God exalts you, you will know he did it, and you can enjoy it, and you also will give him credit for it." I heard about a man who received an honorary degree, and as the citation was being read, you know, he just came out a little more, Ken jutted out, and Ted came back.
[time=3439] After he was always walking across the campus with his wife, and he turned his wife and said, "Do you know how many great men there are in the world?"
[time=3451] She said, "No, I don't know how many great men there are in the world, but I know there's one less than you think."
[time=3464] The Bible says that God gives grace to the humble, but he resists the proud.
[time=3470] The man took his little boy to Kennel's to pick out a little puppy for him,
[time=3476] and the boy had been wanting a dog so much.
[time=3479] And so he sees all these puppies, they say, "Well, which one do you want?" And there's one little puppy there, and his tail is wagging vigorously, back and forth, back and forth.
[time=3489] And he points to that little puppy, and he says, "I want that one with a happy ending." Well, if you avoid the perils of life, you'll have a very, very happy ending.
[time=3505] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir,
[time=3512] the handbells, soloists Lisa Reniker, and Keith Brodigam.
[time=3516] The message today was from our guest speaker, Dr. John Valleau, President of Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=3524] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3532] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3535] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3542] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3546] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my Savior today.
[time=3552] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3556] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3561] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
