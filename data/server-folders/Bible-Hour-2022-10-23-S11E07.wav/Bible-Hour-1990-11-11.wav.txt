[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] The Bible gives us insight into some of the unseen realities,
[time=80] the spiritual realities of life.
[time=82] We know from scripture that in times past Satan met God in conflict and was cast out of heaven.
[time=87] And we know that sometime in the future, Satan and God will meet in final conflict where Satan's doom is sure.
[time=94] What about this in-between time?
[time=96] Scripture seems to tell us that Satan still has access to God.
[time=99] And I hope you'll join us this morning as we look at one of the times when Satan visits God.

[time=1729] That is great. Aren't you glad you came today? Some of you thought twice about it this morning, didn't you, as you got up and thought? Maybe today, I'll just relax a little bit, but you came and I'm glad you're here. You look like you're glad to be here. I told the first hour they looked a little dead this morning. You know, that's...
[time=1748] they do most first hours. They haven't been in their ABFs, haven't had the coffee in the stirring conversation yet, but you always come. You look a little more prepared and ready to get into things, and I appreciate that.
[time=1761] You know, there seems to be a curiosity among ourselves, among people, about things that we can't see, things that we don't easily understand, a curiosity about the spiritual realm.
[time=1776] We want to know more about things that happen that we don't understand. There's phenomena that take place that people get excited about because it's outside of the realm of normality.
[time=1788] We call them miracles or just the unexplained, and you can even order a series of books from Time Life that goes through these mysteries that explain them all, talk about them all.
[time=1800] And we're interested in those kinds of things. Even in the church, a couple books in the last few years that have come out, fictional books, this present darkness and now the sequel, "Piercing the Darkness," have gained a lot of attention and interest because they give us a possible insight as to what is happening in the spiritual realm around us and the battle that's taking place between the forces of God and the forces of Satan, and that interests us.
[time=1827] We have a curiosity about that. We want to know more. Sometimes that curiosity leads us in wrong ways.
[time=1836] I became aware even this last week of a group of students, high school students, involved in Satanism. I know it is affecting Snyder High School and the high school at Leo, probably other high schools as well.
[time=1852] And I understand that this week, even they're having one of their functions, that they're inviting other students to come in and see what they do.
[time=1858] And I'm sure the curiosity of this will probably draw a lot of students in. We're curious about the spiritual realm.
[time=1865] Well, scripture gives us some glimpses, some insight into things that happen in this dimension.
[time=1872] And I'm always interested to see, to get a little insight into what may take place in the heavenlies, what may take place in the unseen.
[time=1880] And what we're going to look at this morning is one of those glimpses. We're going to look at a time when Satan makes a visit to God.
[time=1888] If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to the book of Job. You can find Psalms somewhere in the middle of your Bible.
[time=1894] And just right before Psalms is the book of Job. And we're going to look at the first chapter of Job.
[time=1899] And I'd like you to read with me Job chapter 1 verses 6 through 12. Job 1 beginning at verse 6.
[time=1910] One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them.
[time=1918] The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the Lord from roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.
[time=1927] Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There's no one on earth like him.
[time=1935] He is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
[time=1943] "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has?
[time=1950] You've blessed the work of his hand so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
[time=1955] But God, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
[time=1963] The Lord said to Satan, "Very well then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger."
[time=1975] Satan pays a visit to God, and in this short passage we see three primary characters mentioned.
[time=1984] What I'd like to do this morning is just quickly go through some things that we can learn from these characters in this passage.
[time=1991] Then ask some questions about ourselves. The three characters are the servant of God, Job, the accuser, Satan, and the Lord King God himself.
[time=2002] Let's look at the servant first of all. What are some of the things that we can know about Job from this passage?
[time=2009] Job was from the land of us, not where the wonderful wizard comes from. This is Uzi, not Ozi.
[time=2015] And referred to as the place in the east, probably somewhere east of Canaan, the Jordan River.
[time=2021] And the scripture tells us that Job was a prosperous man.
[time=2025] He was prosperous in most areas of his life. In this passage we see that he had seven sons, he had three daughters.
[time=2033] He owned a lot of animals, 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of ox, and 500 donkeys, it tells us in the first part of the chapter.
[time=2042] It also says that he had many servants. In fact in verse 3 of chapter 1 it says that Job was the greatest man among all the people of the east.
[time=2052] And this greatness wasn't in his physical characteristics or his strength or even his moral quality, it's talking about the possessions, the things that he had.
[time=2060] He was a prosperous man. The second thing we know about Job was that he was devoted. He was devoted to God.
[time=2069] Now this is especially significant in light of his prosperity.
[time=2074] A lot of times we have different opinions about prosperity in the life of the believer.
[time=2080] Sometimes we speak in terms of extremes. On one extreme we're told that prosperity is guaranteed in the life of the believer.
[time=2093] That if we are devoted to God that God will bring prosperity in our life, that we will have possessions, we'll have health, we'll have wealth.
[time=2101] And that's one extreme. Anyone who is devoted Christian should experience, should possess these things.
[time=2106] The other extreme is that a person is a Christian shouldn't be prosperous.
[time=2110] If you have a lot of things you need to get rid of them all and you need to live near a level of poverty and give what you have to other people.
[time=2118] And so anyone who is a Christian and is prosperous anyway really is living in sin, disobedience. That's not right.
[time=2125] I believe the truth of Scripture is somewhere in between the two.
[time=2128] God does bless. God does prosper believers. We're to be stewards of what he gives us.
[time=2136] But we need to be careful in saying that God guarantees prosperity.
[time=2142] I think the wonder of what Job's character was that he was devoted even in the middle of his prosperity because prosperity in the life of a believer is something that we need to be cautious of.
[time=2154] When we start getting a lot of things, when God blesses us with a lot of things and we are prosperous, the tendency is to get our focus off devotion to God and instead focus on the things that we have and on what we have done to achieve in getting those things.
[time=2168] In fact, the warning that Moses gives the people of Israel is they're about ready to enter the land that God has promised them.
[time=2174] Moses gives this warning in Deuteronomy chapter 8. It says, "When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.
[time=2182] But be careful that you do not forget the Lord your God.
[time=2186] Otherwise when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase.
[time=2195] And all you have is multiplied, then your heart will become proud, and you will forget the Lord your God.
[time=2203] And you may say to yourself, "My power and my strength have produced this wealth for me."
[time=2209] But Moses said, "Remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth."
[time=2217] Job is to be commended because in the middle of his prosperity, he did not forget where it all came from.
[time=2225] And he remained devoted to God.
[time=2229] We see the degree of Job's devotion.
[time=2233] In verse 8, when God is speaking of him, it says that there is no one else on earth who is like Job.
[time=2241] If we measured spirituality on some sort of scale, Job would have been right there up on the top.
[time=2247] And God goes on to describe the characteristics of Job's devotion.
[time=2252] In verses 1 and in verse 8, it says that Job was blameless. He was upright. He feared God. He shunned evil.
[time=2259] He was blameless. Now King James version interprets this word. He was perfect.
[time=2265] But we need to be careful. We don't get the idea that saying that Job was sinless. He wasn't. This word blameless carries the idea of moral integrity.
[time=2273] There was a completeness about Job that his integrity and his devotion to God affected every area of his life.
[time=2281] And every time, not when he was just in front of people who expected of him, when he went on a trip, when he was with people he didn't know.
[time=2288] When he could get away with things, Job still maintained a personal moral integrity.
[time=2294] He was blameless in that regard. He was upright. He lived in an upright way. He followed a straight path. He feared God.
[time=2303] He understood God for the awesome God that he was and saw himself in his own inadequacy and sin and feared God.
[time=2311] And he shunned evil.
[time=2313] There's a song written a few years ago by contemporary Christian artist named Mylon the Feather.
[time=2317] The title of the song is Love God Hate Sin. I always liked the song my kids did too. They go around the house singing Love God Hate Sin.
[time=2324] Job was someone who hated sin. He shunned evil. When we look in the first part of this chapter, we see an example of how far Job would go in his shunning of evil.
[time=2337] Job's four and five tells us that his sons and daughters would on occasion get together for feasting and festivities.
[time=2344] Now we don't know if this was done in a wrong way or in a way that wasn't improper, but they would get together on occasion and have a party.
[time=2353] And the scripture tells us that when these parties, when these festivities were done, Job would call us children together and would offer sacrifice for them.
[time=2361] Now Job apparently lived during the time of the patriarchs before the law was given. And during this time, the head of the household, the father of the families, the head of the clans were the priests were the go-betweens, the representatives of their family of their clan to God.
[time=2376] And Job serving in that capacity would offer sacrifice for his children. And it's interesting in verse chapter five that is Job offer the sacrifices he was thinking.
[time=2387] Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.
[time=2392] And it says that this was the regular custom of Job. Job wasn't just concerned about the outward sins. He was concerned about even the sins of thought, the sins of the heart that might be there.
[time=2402] He was a man who shunned evil. He was devoted to God. He was prosperous. He was devoted. From the passage we also learned that Job was unaware.
[time=2415] Job was unaware of the cosmic dialogue that was taking place between Satan and God. In fact, if you read and are familiar with the book of Job, you know that there are a lot of hardships and questions that come into the life of this man.
[time=2427] And yet during it all, he has never let in on the behind the scene happenings. Job is unaware of what is happening in the spiritual realm.
[time=2439] Let's move to the next character, the accuser Satan himself. The word Satan, the name Satan literally means accuser.
[time=2447] And we see Satan playing that role in this passage. What are some things that are important to understand about the accuser in this passage?
[time=2455] First of all that he was able to approach God. Satan was able to come before God.
[time=2463] Now perhaps in our minds sometimes we get the idea that this accuser, this Satan, was at one time cast out of heaven.
[time=2470] And we know that there's coming a day when he is going to be judged again by God. But in the in between time, I think we get the idea sometimes that there's this division between heaven and earth. Satan's down here, God's up there and never the two shall meet.
[time=2483] And yet in Scripture we see here, we see in Revelation we see Ezekiel that Satan apparently continues to have some access to God, for some reason God allows us.
[time=2494] And Satan was able to come with the other angels, the messengers of God, coming before the throne of the king to give report, to give praise, whatever they were doing. Satan slips in among them.
[time=2503] He comes in and stands before the throne and God begins a dialogue with Satan. He has access to God.
[time=2509] The second thing I realize in this passage is that he is ready. He is ready to accuse. He is ready to accuse Job.
[time=2516] When God brings up the name of Job, Satan doesn't have to go refer to his roll of decks or punch in the computer to find out who this Job character is. Satan knows.
[time=2527] Satan knows who God is talking about. And not only that, Satan is ready to give accusation. He is ready.
[time=2536] God says, have you seen my servant, Job? Have you seen the qualities of his life? And Satan's reaction to this.
[time=2545] God, of course, what do you expect? I mean, look at everything you've given him. I mean, he's got a family. He's got all these possessions.
[time=2552] And what's more than that, you've not only given these things, but you kind of put this hedge. I can't even get at him. You won't let me in.
[time=2558] You protect everything. What do you expect? He's got all the stuff he's got it made. Of course he serves you, but I'll tell you this, God.
[time=2565] You take it away. You take all that stuff away from him, and I promise you this, he is going to turn to your face and curse you.
[time=2572] That's what Satan accuses. Satan accuses Job of having a devotion that is not a devotion of integrity. It's a hypocrisy that is only there because of what God has given him.
[time=2583] You take all that stuff away, you strip it out of his life, and Satan accuses Job when you get down to the realness of his life, he's going to turn around and curse your face, God.
[time=2593] He's ready to accuse. We also see here that the accuser was permitted to persecute Job.
[time=2600] It's interesting that Satan himself recognized that there was some sort of protection placed around Job that he couldn't, he was not able, a boundary that he was not able to get into, but God then permitted him to persecute Job.
[time=2614] First of all, Satan was allowed to persecute Job by taking away his family, taking away the things, his possessions, taking away his servants.
[time=2623] And then later on, we see that Satan was even allowed to touch the health of Job so that he became so miserable he wanted to die. Satan was permitted.
[time=2632] We need to understand that Satan just doesn't have free reign to do whatever he pleases. He can only work within the boundaries that God establishes for a time.
[time=2643] He cannot work independently from the will of God. Let's look at the third character in this passage, and that is the character of the Lord, the King.
[time=2653] What are some things that are significant about him that we learn?
[time=2658] Well, first of all, I see in this passage that the King, the Lord God himself, glories in obedience. He glories in the obedience of his people.
[time=2669] Last year, my daughter was in first grade attending Haley Elementary School, and she entered the art project at school, and won first place.
[time=2679] So the night came when the parents went in to see all the different projects that were done, and of course, I just wanted to see my daughter's project there with the blue ribbon stuck to it.
[time=2689] I remember going into that display room with my camera, and my daughter standing up with her picture in the little blue ribbon next to it and feeling kind of proud as people walk by.
[time=2699] That's my girl there, one first place in the art. I just felt kind of a proud in the accomplishments of my daughter.
[time=2706] We feel that way as parents about our children. We like to brag on them sometimes.
[time=2711] You go into the home of most grandparents and see it sitting right there on the coffee table in the living room. You'll find a little book.
[time=2718] And unless you want to spend a little time, you're going to not say anything about it, because once you do, you pick it up there.
[time=2723] Oh, yes, there's a little grandson Johnny here. He's growing up now, tottering through the living room in a little hair.
[time=2730] And they'll tell you everything about him, and you pretend like you're interested.
[time=2733] But we have these little things. We call them brag books.
[time=2736] And I think God, in a sense, has his brag book, and he brings it out to Satan here.
[time=2742] Well, Satan, let me show you some shots here of Job. This guy is really with it.
[time=2747] God glories in the obedience of his people.
[time=2753] I think sometimes our view of God is so impersonal. God's just this deity up there that is up there to make sure we don't do anything wrong.
[time=2765] And yet I believe God reacts even emotionally in the obedience of his people.
[time=2771] That's why I often find myself praying, asking God to find pleasure in my life, to find pleasure in the worship of our church.
[time=2778] Because I think God does that. He glories in the obedience of his people.
[time=2783] Other thing I see about the Lord here is that he does reward faithfulness.
[time=2787] In Job's case, he brought protection and blessing into Job's life.
[time=2792] He rewards faithfulness. Now, that reward may not always come to us in the same time and in the same way,
[time=2798] but I believe that God promises that he rewards faithfulness.
[time=2802] But I also see here that the Lord allows difficulties to come in to the believer's life.
[time=2810] He allows difficulties. Now, people object to that.
[time=2815] We can't understand how a loving God who controls things can allow difficulties, hardships, pains, persecutions,
[time=2823] sufferings, trials to come into people's life, especially life of a believer.
[time=2828] Some people say, "My God wouldn't do that. Your God might." That's not my God you're talking about as if we all had our own little personal gods that we described.
[time=2836] The God in this passage allows suffering, severe suffering, to come into the life of someone who is living in devotion to him.
[time=2845] He allows it to happen. Some people say, "Well, if you just live right, if you just live right, God will bless you."
[time=2852] And by blessing they mean that you will be prosperous financially and that you'll be healthy and none of these trials will come into your life.
[time=2858] But here Job shows us that isn't true. The Lord allows difficulties.
[time=2863] If that was true, if righteousness resulted in those kinds of blessing, then we would expect that in any third world country where Christians existed,
[time=2871] that they would rise out of that third world depravity and financial need and that they would be ones who could rise above that.
[time=2880] But we don't see that. I was in Jamaica this past week visiting one of the churches we support.
[time=2886] And you're always encouraged to see believers in a setting that we're not used to.
[time=2893] In a setting where we would go down and say, "Boy, these people have great personal financial need."
[time=2899] In circumstances that we would consider sometimes unbearable and unbelievable, I watched some of the men of one church worked on the land that they had just purchased for their new church building.
[time=2909] And in steps they are going to eventually have a church.
[time=2914] But I watched them on this property as four of the men worked on these huge boulders trying to clear away the property for lay the foundation of their church.
[time=2923] I'm not exaggerating, they were huge. And they worked with two regular sized hand hammers chipping away at these boulders.
[time=2930] And we wouldn't even think of things like that.
[time=2933] But I see people down there who are faithful to God, who love God and it shows in the sincerity of their life.
[time=2939] But God doesn't bless them with great wealth.
[time=2941] And sometimes we would look at the circumstances of their life and say, "Those are trials." God just doesn't make those kind of guarantees even when we live righteously.
[time=2951] In fact, the Bible seems to infer that many times because of our righteous living we will face trials.
[time=2958] Sometimes our righteousness, our devotion to God, is the reason that we face difficulties.
[time=2963] That was Job's case.
[time=2965] That's the case in 1 Peter chapter 4 when Peter is writing a letter to the believers and saying it is because of your righteousness that you are suffering, don't be ashamed of that.
[time=2974] Rather, he says, commit yourself to being faithful in the suffering that is according to God's will.
[time=2982] God allows suffering. We know he allows suffering in our life.
[time=2988] He allows difficulties in our life because of discipline sometimes.
[time=2991] It teaches us in Hebrews chapter 12.
[time=2993] He allows difficulties in our life sometimes to help us grow.
[time=2996] And James says that we consider it pure joy whenever you face the trials of many kind because you know that those trials are working in your life to produce godly character.
[time=3006] He brings difficulties in our life to honor himself.
[time=3010] Do you remember the blind man that Jesus met on the road one day and healed this blind man and the people asked Jesus concerning him?
[time=3017] Jesus, why is this man blind? Is it because he sent or his parents sent and Jesus said neither?
[time=3022] His blindness is there simply so that God can be glorified.
[time=3027] And when Paul prayed asking God to remove the thorn, whatever infirmity is suffering, difficult to he was facing,
[time=3034] let's say remove the thorn and the flesh from me. God said, I've put that there so that my greatness can be shown in your weakness.
[time=3041] My strength will be evident in your weakness.
[time=3044] Sometimes God brings difficulties simply for his own honor.
[time=3048] Sometimes as in Job's case, God brings difficulties into our life as a test of our faith.
[time=3056] The Lord allowed difficulties. But then we need to see here that the Lord also set the boundaries in which Satan was to work.
[time=3068] Before the boundaries were, there's a hedge around Job and his possessions and his family. Satan couldn't get in there.
[time=3075] God moved the boundaries, said okay, Satan, now you can take everything, you can touch everything except the life of Job.
[time=3082] The boundaries narrowed. And later on in chapter 2, we see that God even narrows the boundaries a little more.
[time=3087] He says, okay, you can touch his life, but you can't take it. You can't kill him.
[time=3091] But the important thing is that Satan could only work within the boundaries of God.
[time=3099] God allows Satan to work for a time. His doom, his end is sure, but he has set the boundaries and Satan is free to work within.
[time=3107] Now this is the importance of the church. This is the importance of our being together.
[time=3112] Jesus said of the church that even the gates of hell will not be able to prevail against it.
[time=3116] The church should be a boundary that keeps Satan at bay.
[time=3121] When we come together, when we exercise the gifts that God's Spirit has given us, when we encourage one another, when we pray, the boundaries are set, and Satan himself cannot pass them.
[time=3133] This is what makes, in 1 Corinthians, when Paul tells the church there, he says, you need to take this person who is sinning, continues to sin, and that's a shame to you.
[time=3143] You need to take that person, remove them from your church, and hand them over to Satan.
[time=3148] And that's what he's saying. He says, you take this person that was within the protection of the church, the boundaries of the church, you push him outside the boundaries, and he's free game for Satan's work in his life now.
[time=3158] That was an extreme measure. We need to understand the importance of that, but God sets the boundaries that Satan works in.
[time=3167] Now let me just ask some questions of us. If these things are true, if we learn these things from Job, what are some questions we can ask of ourselves?
[time=3175] Let me, first of all, ask some questions of those of you who are followers of Christ, Christians.
[time=3183] Today is your life in God's Bragg book, or would you find your life on Satan's accusation list?
[time=3197] Of the things in my life that God's able to pull out and say, look at Tim Teder, he's blameless, upright, he fears me, he avoids, he hates evil.
[time=3211] Lord, to Satan, as he approaches the throne of God, is he able to say, God have you seen that Tim Teder of yours?
[time=3221] Look at all you did to save him. You sent Jesus to die for him. Look what he's doing. Look how he offends you. Look at the hypocrisy in his life.
[time=3231] Look at how he is when no one else sees God. What is your life? God's Bragg book around Satan's accusation list.
[time=3240] We need to find pleasure in the fact that God is pleased with our obedience.
[time=3245] That's another question. Maybe you're not facing trials in your life right now, but are you prepared for trials?
[time=3253] Job didn't have any trials, and he was completely unaware of what was about to happen in his life that would just turn his whole world upside down.
[time=3260] If that were to happen to you, would you be prepared? Job was. Job was prepared because he was prepared inwardly.
[time=3267] If you wait till the moment of great trial in your life to get things right with God, you will go through a lot of questioning and uncertainty
[time=3275] and perhaps great devastation in your spiritual life. You need to prepare yourself now.
[time=3279] I remember growing up, we used to play this game. The guys would get around, and we'd prepare ourselves. We'd tighten our stomachs, and then the other guy would punch you as hard as he could right there.
[time=3291] And we could take it. We were men, you know? Do it again. Do it again. Okay, wait. Okay, go!
[time=3296] Not just again. We could take it. We used to do that back and forth, but we also enjoyed it at times, waiting until the person wasn't expecting it.
[time=3302] They were in between breasts, and you just give them a light little tap right there, and they're doubled over.
[time=3306] When you're not prepared, it really hits you. I get the picture that sometimes Satan or his workers are standing there wanting to punch us good.
[time=3317] And many times, God's hand is there holding back. We don't face the trials right now, perhaps.
[time=3323] But what happens in the time when God says, "Okay, there's a testing of the faith, and he lets go, and the punch comes, will we be ready?"
[time=3330] Or will it double us over? We need to be ready for trials.
[time=3335] I'll ask you one more question. Can you accept trouble from the hand of God?
[time=3340] If you're facing suffering trouble, things you can't explain in your life, can you accept that from the hand of God?
[time=3347] When Job lost everything, and he's sitting out, wishing that thinking would be better off to be dead than in his circumstances now, his wife, the only person God left to him, that great encourager, came up to Job and said, "Job, husband, you miserable rump of humanity.
[time=3366] Don't you know that it would be better off if you just cursed God right now and died?"
[time=3372] And Job's response is so great, chapter 2, verse 10, he says, "Shall I accept blessing and good from the hand of God, and not accept trouble also, hardship also?
[time=3383] Do you accept trouble from the hand of God? Or do you get frustrated? Do you get angry? Do you complain?
[time=3389] Do you kind of wallow in all the things that you have to go through and never get beyond that?
[time=3394] We need to be willing to accept the good things and the hardships from the sovereign hand of God.
[time=3399] One last question. To those of you who have maybe never committed your life to Jesus Christ, I want to ask you the question, are you willing to accept the unseen realities?
[time=3411] Are you willing to accept the unseen realities? There is a Creator that we will give account to someday who has provided a way through us through Jesus Christ to know Him.
[time=3423] You can't see that. You can't touch God. You can't touch now Jesus Christ. These are things that are unseen.
[time=3431] Even today, we aren't aware of what is around us. The angels that the Bible tells us are curious about what happens in the church, perhaps seated in the seats or standing around us.
[time=3441] We can't see those things, but do you accept the reality of the unseen things that God has concerned about your life?
[time=3448] It has provided a way through Jesus Christ for you to have a relationship with Him.
[time=3454] Are you willing to accept that?
[time=3461] [MUSIC]
[time=3481] It has been a privilege today to share with you the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir and Susan Stump and our special guest, guitarist Jonathan Birchfield.
[time=3490] The message today was from our associate pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=3495] If you've listened to this program today and you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3503] Will you bow and pray with me? Dear Heavenly Father, I know that you sent your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3513] And today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart today. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior.
[time=3523] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3527] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3532] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
