[time=90] November reminds us of the occurrence of "Thanksgiving," but if you ever given consideration to "Thanksliving," no it's not a steady diet of turkey and dressing, but it is a biblically prescribed alternative to the fast-track culture that's in pursuit of greed.
[time=116] We want to evaluate the components of "Thanksliving" in our study of God's Word this morning.
