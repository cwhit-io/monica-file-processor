[time=86] John D. Rockefeller was one of the wealthiest men in the world.
[time=91] By the 1870s he had amassed a fortune of over $10 million.
[time=95] In the next 20 years he would have amassed millions and millions more from his various business interests.
[time=101] But on the day he died, reporters from all over came to the standard oil building to hear his secretary tell the details of his death.
[time=109] That day one reporter asked, "How much money did old John D. leave behind?
[time=115] How much did he leave behind?" The secretary looked at the man, thought for a moment and then said, "Very simple."
[time=124] He left all of it. He left all of it.
[time=128] That story tells us about the futility of laying up treasures upon this earth.
[time=134] Jesus said, "Lay not treasures up upon this earth, but lay up treasures in heaven." Jesus also said, "Where your heart is, your treasure will also be." I want to ask a question this morning.
[time=147] Are you in the process of laying up treasures upon this earth that will one day all belong to someone else?
[time=153] Or have you embraced Christ and are you laying up treasures in heaven that will live forever?
[time=159] [MUSIC]
[time=168] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=173] Thank you for joining us.
[time=175] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=178] Jim's message is entitled, "Are You Building Up Treasures in Heaven?" We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=187] Our special musical guest today are Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=192] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a medley of songs beginning with "The Greatest Thing."
[time=200] [MUSIC - 329 seconds]
[time=551] [APPLAUSE]
[time=557] Rejoice in the Lord always and I say again, rejoice.
[time=560] Him number 228, we'll continue praising the Lord for the good things he's done.
[time=565] 228, we'll sing verses one and four.
[time=569] [MUSIC - 47 seconds]
[time=644] Thank you for lifting your voices to the Lord, we appreciate that when you join with us.
[time=648] We have the special privilege today of welcoming back to Blackhawk Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=653] We recently moved from California to Colorado and are serving with youth for Christ International there.
[time=658] They're heading for the East Coast and we're just thankful that they have the opportunity to stop at Blackhawk and sing for us this morning and minister to us.
[time=666] Welcome Steve and Maria, let's welcome them, will you do that?
[time=669] [APPLAUSE]
[time=674] Thank you Pete and friends, it's great to be back and hear this great choir and the orchestra, wonderful.
[time=680] To praise God together, this morning as we sing these next two songs, we focus on the holiness of God.
[time=688] [MUSIC]
[time=693] Holy is He, the Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise.
[time=700] We worship Him only, lover of truth, father of mercy.
[time=707] Holy is He, holy is He.
[time=712] Holy is He, O let us adore Him, lift up His name, we bow down before Him, righteous and just.
[time=723] High and exalted, holy is He, holy is He.
[time=730] [MUSIC]
[time=733] He reigns on high with strength and compassion, Baruch Adonai, faithful companions.
[time=742] He ridden light, life everlasting, holy is He, holy is He.
[time=751] Holy is He, holy is He.
[time=756] The Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise.
[time=761] We worship Him only, lover of truth, father of mercy.
[time=768] Holy is He, holy is He, holy is He.
[time=776] [MUSIC]
[time=780] Holy is unchanged, God of our fathers, cry out His name.
[time=787] He faithfully answers, glorious King, wonderful Savior, holy is He.
[time=796] Holy is He, holy is He.
[time=815] Holy is He, the Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise.
[time=821] We worship Him only, lover of truth, father of mercy.
[time=828] Holy is He, holy is He.
[time=865] It's always like homecoming to come back here.
[time=888] You know, so many things have changed over the years and so many things remain the same.
[time=893] So many friends that we cherish and even though we live a long ways away from here, you are always in our hearts and you are in our prayers, especially in these days.
[time=904] We hope that we remain in your prayers.
[time=907] We continue to travel around the country and around the world representing youth for Christ.
[time=911] This last summer we had an opportunity to be in Africa and in the USSR for nearly a month.
[time=918] We've never had an experience quite like that.
[time=920] I don't know if we ever will again, but to see even uniformed military personnel respond
[time=928] to a gospel invitation in the Soviet Union, outdoors in the city square and come forward
[time=935] giving names and addresses so they could be followed up by the local churches.
[time=939] I never thought I would live to see, but we thank God for how He is moving around the world.
[time=947] From the book of Revelation, we hear these words, "Great and marvelous are thy works,
[time=953] O Lord God the Almighty.
[time=956] Worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power.
[time=963] All the nations of the earth will come and worship before thee, for thou hast created all things.
[time=969] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come."
[time=986] Gracious Father, gracious Father, we are so blessed to be your children, gracious Father.
[time=1005] And we lift our hearts before you as a token of our love, gracious Father, gracious Father.
[time=1022] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, and we lift our hearts before you as a token
[time=1046] of our love, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=1068] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=1122] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.
[time=1138] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=1168] Good morning, I hope that you're enjoying the ministry of music from Steve and Maria
[time=1178] Gardner.
[time=1179] Steve and Maria are former residents of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and now live in Denver, Colorado.
[time=1185] And we're glad that they happen to be passing through today and stopped in to minister with us.
[time=1190] And then they'll be going on their way to the East Coast to give several concerts.
[time=1194] We're glad they're here.
[time=1195] We'll always enjoy their music and we'll be hearing from them a little bit later.
[time=1200] Next Sunday on the broadcast, you'll be hearing Tyrone Lacey and Amy Roth sing for us.
[time=1205] Tyrone is from California, and Amy is from Nashville, Tennessee.
[time=1209] They joined together to give just really great music.
[time=1212] And in fact, if you're in the Fort Wayne area and watching right now, you can get here for the 6 p.m. service tonight.
[time=1218] I hope that you'll join with us for their concert.
[time=1222] Also next week, David Burnham will be speaking to us.
[time=1225] He's just recently returned from Russia and Thailand.
[time=1228] It will have some very informative information for us concerning these countries and the spiritual
[time=1234] growth there.
[time=1235] I hope that you'll join us for the Bible Hour next week.
[time=1239] So many of you have written in recently, and I'm really appreciative of that.
[time=1242] It really encourages us when we receive mail from those that are watching the Bible Hour.
[time=1248] Jim, it's nice to have you on the set this morning.
[time=1250] And I was just telling you before we began that we are encouraged when people write letters to us, and I want to share a few of those right now.
[time=1258] Pete, good morning to you, and it's always a pleasure to be with you.
[time=1261] It was a pleasure to be with a lot of people over in Winone Lake, Indiana, Friday evening.
[time=1266] Probably 30 or 40 at a memorial service who told me we watched the Bible Hour every week.
[time=1271] Some of them have written to us.
[time=1273] One writes, "We want to thank and commend every person who has contributed to the ongoing services at Blackhawk in the absence of a senior pastor.
[time=1281] The Spirit of God is truly evident." And yet another Pete writes, "We enjoy the Bible Hour each Sunday.
[time=1287] The messages are most helpful.
[time=1289] My husband Wayne has Alzheimer's and is in a total care patient facility.
[time=1294] He is at home and enjoys television." Jim, we really are encouraged by these letters.
[time=1299] I have a couple more that I'd like to read.
[time=1301] This one says, "We continue to enjoy the Bible Hour each Sunday, though we miss Rick Hawks." I think the choir and all the vocalists and instrumentalists do a tremendous job giving praise through music.
[time=1312] Jim Pearson, Tim Teder, and the guest speakers, too, are to be commended.
[time=1316] I especially praise the Lord for men like Dr. John Valleau.
[time=1320] We've had some tremendous speakers in here, Jim, and as this letter states, "I want to second the fact that we commend you and Tim for your wonderful work each Sunday."
[time=1330] And then here's a man that's in jail.
[time=1332] He writes, "Greetings to you and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1335] I am an inmate here at Allen County Correctional Institute, trying my best to get to know our Lord as much as I can.
[time=1342] I watch your program on WTLWTV, Channel 44, and Lima.
[time=1347] I sincerely enjoy it a lot.
[time=1349] It is a blessing to me.
[time=1352] The Bible Hour reaches out into your home.
[time=1354] If you're not feeling well today and you're watching, we're glad that we have this opportunity to bring to you spiritual food for your daily living.
[time=1361] Those that cannot go to church often write in and tell us what a joy it is to watch the
[time=1367] Bible Hour.
[time=1368] And that's an encouragement to our entire staff.
[time=1371] We have a number of volunteers that come in each Sunday morning to prepare to air the Bible Hour, and we're glad that you've tuned in today.
[time=1380] Jim, on a number of occasions, just recently, we've encountered people that have gone through really life-threatening such situations and they even have lost their lives.
[time=1390] I've been amazed at the number of people that can use the grace of God and have that in their lives because they've been walking closely with the Lord, and yet there are some instances when people are just crying out because they just haven't been close to the Lord in a life-threatening
[time=1405] situation.
[time=1406] Pete, the Apostle Paul said, "Through all of the trials and tribulations of life, I have learned the secret of being content, learning to trust God and finding Him faithful."
[time=1417] That's what it's all about.
[time=1418] That's encouraging, Jim, and that reminds me of a book that we want to offer to you.
[time=1422] It's called "What Every Christian Should Know About Growing." It's one thing to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=1428] It's another thing to grow with Him and to be prepared because you have a relationship with Jesus Christ and with other Christian believers that'll give you strength.
[time=1438] These are basic steps.
[time=1439] They're simple, but they're a way to grow and to know Jesus Christ in a better way.
[time=1444] We'd like to offer this book this week, and you can receive it today by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1456] Once again, you can receive this book absolutely free by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East
[time=1464] State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1470] We're going back to the live portion of our broadcast now with Stephen Maria ministering to us in song, and then we look forward to the message from our associate pastor, Jim Pearson.
[time=1480] Thank you for staying with us.
[time=1482] As we sing this morning and look out over the audience, keep spotting more faces and
[time=1490] memories.
[time=1491] Flood back.
[time=1492] I can't tell you how great it is.
[time=1497] Maybe if we looked into the camera, we'd see the faces of some other friends, maybe out in television land.
[time=1502] Not supposed to say that, I know, but I couldn't resist this morning.
[time=1505] We worship together because Jesus Christ has made us one.
[time=1511] We have become His children, not because we deserve it, but because of His grace, His
[time=1517] life, His blood shed for us.
[time=1520] He is here among us, and so we worship in spirit and truth right here, right now.
[time=1533] Here at now, we've come to share our praise, here and now.
[time=1549] Hearts and voices we will raise, for in this place the spirit has come to help us worship
[time=1561] God's own son.
[time=1569] Right here, right now, here and now, approaches thrown with hearts of praise, together as
[time=1581] one we praise His name, in Jesus Christ, we're all the same, cleansed by His blood, saved
[time=1595] by His life, no room for boasting and be your strength.
[time=1604] We are His bright, cherished and loved, join us with Him to heaven above.
[time=1616] Let us rejoice, praise and adore, Jesus is Lord, here and now.
[time=1632] We've come to share our praise, here and now.
[time=1641] Hearts and voices we will raise, for in this place the spirit has come to help us worship
[time=1655] God's own son, here and now, approaches thrown with hearts of praise, here and now.
[time=1670] We've come to share our praise, here and now, hearts and voices we will raise, for in
[time=1686] this place the spirit has come to help us worship God's own son, here and now.
[time=1699] Approaches thrown with hearts of praise, here and now.
[time=1710] Approaches thrown with hearts of praise, here and now, approaches thrown with hearts
[time=1722] of praise, here and now.
[time=1739] Father, thank you this morning that we can't approach your throne with hearts of praise.
[time=1747] Father, thank you for the great joy, the privilege of approaching that awesome Holy
[time=1753] Throne this very morning.
[time=1756] Father, we would come to you on behalf of so many today in our congregation who are in beds of affliction, who are hurting from the loss of a loved one.
[time=1765] Father, this morning we would pray for Dan and Jan on the loss of Dan's father, but also pray for his wife, Marietta, and I would pray that you would give them comfort, that you
[time=1776] would give them peace and strength as we go through this time.
[time=1779] Thank you, Father, that you have given us your Holy Spirit to comfort us in those tough times of life.
[time=1784] We would pray for the faith family also in the loss of Alpha this morning.
[time=1789] I just ask that you would bless that family and give them strength.
[time=1792] And then Father, as we look to those that are in the hospital, we would pray for Ivalu daily.
[time=1798] I would pray that the radiation treatments would be totally successful, that you would heal her body of the brain tumor that has invaded that part of her body.
[time=1806] And Father, I would pray for Jane Putt this morning, laying her sister to rest, Essie
[time=1812] York, a loved one from our church, and then on that very day falling and breaking a hip and now going through therapy in the hospital.
[time=1820] Father, I just ask that you would meet her need today.
[time=1822] And Father, as I think of those who are here this morning, I think of so many that are here.
[time=1827] I think of all of the needs, both emotional and physical.
[time=1830] I just ask that you would meet with us today.
[time=1833] And then in the remaining moments, bless the speaking of the word, but also bless the music in Christ's name.
[time=1838] [AMEN]
[time=1839] [MUSIC]
[time=1857] Lord, I'm tired of the struggle, fighting in my own strength to be like you.
[time=1868] Walking an armed into battles I never should go to, all because I hadn't listened to you.
[time=1882] So I resolved to set my eyes on you and live each day just as close as I can be.
[time=1893] And I'll trust you to take care of all the things that I can't see.
[time=1901] So as I walk with you, won't you live your life through me?
[time=1910] Let the world see in me all that one can be.
[time=1918] Let them see Jesus, let me fade from the view, till all that is left is you.
[time=1933] Let them see Jesus, Jesus in me.
[time=1941] Lord, help me to surrender, the more that I fight, the more I feel alone.
[time=1952] I can't afford to be running ahead on my own, only hand in hand will we make the journey
[time=1963] home.
[time=1964] And Lord, the world is wandering in darkness, blinded by master lives and misery.
[time=1976] Oh, if only they could see the truth that sets me in free, oh Lord, I pray, let them
[time=1987] see the truth in me, let the world see in me all that one can be.
[time=2002] Let them see Jesus, let me fade from the view, till all that is left is you.
[time=2015] Let them see Jesus, Jesus in me, let the world see in me all that one can be.
[time=2043] Let them see Jesus, Jesus in me.
[time=2063] What the world needs to see today more than ever, what Fort Wayne needs to see is Jesus
[time=2069] Christ.
[time=2071] Some of them are looking for Him, most are not, but when they see Him in you, He can draw them to Himself, and He can meet their needs.
[time=2084] Father, now, once again, we just ask you to bless our time together.
[time=2091] Thank you for the music today, and now bless our time as we open your word in Christ's name.
[time=2097] [AMEN] I remember when transistor radios became popular in the late 1950s, and I was probably seven
[time=2106] or eight years old, and I got one for Christmas.
[time=2109] I can remember taking it to bed with me at night, and when my parents would send me to bed, because I had school the next day, I would put the little transistor radio under my pillow, turn it on, just loud enough to hear it, but nobody else could hear that I had it on, and I would go through the channels, and late at night, I could pull in people from all over the Midwest, and it was really great.
[time=2129] I remember especially enjoying listening to the myriad of radio preachers who were on
[time=2135] at that time in our nation's history.
[time=2137] Oh, there were all different types of radio preachers, but there was one who really attracted me, and I would listen to him as often as I could pick him up late at night.
[time=2147] He was called the apostle of green power, the apostle of the good life.
[time=2152] He unabashedly proclaimed on his radio program that he loved money.
[time=2158] As he put it, I love money.
[time=2160] Money is not wrong in its right place, and as much as he asked for money, I believe he believed that the right place was in his right pocket.
[time=2167] Oh, this prophet of the health and wealth gospel proclaimed it strongly.
[time=2173] I remember him teasing and chastising fundamentalist preachers who said, who he said, should not
[time=2179] promise their people pie in the sky and the sweet by and by.
[time=2184] He turned to his audience, and he would say, I want my pie now, and I want it with ice cream on top.
[time=2191] I remember maybe it was the preacher in me at that time just yearning to come out, but
[time=2197] I used to picture him as he would move around the auditorium as I would hear him on the radio, and I remember one time I heard him turn to his audience, and he said, brothers and sisters, remember, the root of all evil is the lack of money.
[time=2211] He was at one extreme.
[time=2214] He was one of the early proponents of what we might call the health and wealth gospel.
[time=2219] Prosperity, theology, what others have called the gospel of greed, name it and claim it.
[time=2227] He was at one extreme of the biblical view of money, and then, of course, at the other extreme, throughout our history, we have had others.
[time=2236] One of those was St. Francis of Assisi.
[time=2239] Several hundred years ago, St. Francis became convicted that one should, if he was going to be truly a spiritual Christian, divest himself or herself of all of their worldly goods,
[time=2250] and he took that seriously and went to live with some of his followers in a monastery living
[time=2256] in a life of poverty.
[time=2258] While we have the extreme of poverty, the extreme of great wealth, I believe truly that Jesus has given us, in his word, a proper biblical perspective on money and possessions.
[time=2272] That's what I'd like to look at today, and I'd like to begin that by just asking the question, where is your treasure today?
[time=2279] Where is my treasure?
[time=2281] What I consider to be that which is most important to me in my life.
[time=2286] Turn with me to the sixth chapter of the book of Matthew, the sixth chapter of the book
[time=2292] of Matthew.
[time=2293] We're going to look at verses 19 through 24, and as we do this morning, I want us to see
[time=2299] three commands, which I believe, if heeded, will give us a proper perspective on money
[time=2306] and possessions.
[time=2307] Three commands that our Lord gives to us that if we will heed them and take them into our heart, I believe will give us a lifelong biblical perspective of money and possessions.
[time=2319] Beginning with verse 19, Jesus said, "Do not store up for us.
[time=2323] Don't store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[time=2337] For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[time=2341] The eye is the lamp of the body, and if your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
[time=2347] But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.
[time=2351] If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?
[time=2356] No one can serve two masters.
[time=2359] Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise
[time=2365] the other.
[time=2366] You cannot serve both God and money.
[time=2370] This morning as we look at a biblical perspective on money and possessions, I would first like to point out from verses 19 through 21 that Jesus commands us to have a single treasure.
[time=2383] He commands us to have a single treasure in our lives.
[time=2387] The key to understanding verse 19 is in a few of the words that come, and if we are really
[time=2394] going to understand, we must get into the deeper meaning of what Jesus was saying.
[time=2399] This he says first of all, do not store up some of the other versions say lay up or put
[time=2405] up, but the idea is don't store up or lay up possessions.
[time=2411] That phrase in the original Greek gave a connotation of stacking, the idea of a horizontal stacking
[time=2419] of gold pieces or dollars or some other types of possession.
[time=2424] So Jesus is saying first of all, do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon this earth.
[time=2430] Do not live your life in such a way that you seek only to stack and stack and stack money,
[time=2438] money and possessions, putting it aside for all to see.
[time=2444] The idea there is also that of putting aside possessions for the purpose of letting other
[time=2450] people see them.
[time=2453] And so Jesus is giving us a clear but firm directive here that we are not to seek to
[time=2459] store up endless amounts of money in this life for all of the world to see and all of
[time=2465] the world to be envious of.
[time=2468] He says that we are not to do that.
[time=2470] Also notice he says that we are not to store it up for yourselves.
[time=2475] Jesus is saying there that when we make it our bent in life, to accumulate possessions
[time=2481] for ourselves either for our own selfish interests of spending it all upon ourselves or perhaps
[time=2488] hoarding it and putting it aside for all to see.
[time=2492] When we make it the goal of our life personally to accumulate for ourselves all of the wealth
[time=2499] and possessions that we can, Jesus says that we are building up treasure upon this earth
[time=2505] and he says that that's the way it's not to be, that's not the way that we are to go
[time=2511] through life.
[time=2512] Notice as he goes on he tells us why it is futile and why it is foolish for us to do
[time=2518] just that in this life.
[time=2520] First of all he says don't lay up treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy.
[time=2527] Have you ever wondered how a moth might destroy someone's treasure?
[time=2532] Well in Jesus' day in the time of our Lord people who had great amounts of gold would
[time=2538] pay to have that gold woven into threat and they would embroider the gold into their clothing.
[time=2544] Now that's served two purposes for them, number one it gave them a place to store their wealth
[time=2550] because safe places were hard to come by but second of all the amount of gold embroidered
[time=2556] into their clothing would show the world how wealthy they were.
[time=2560] Jesus says don't do that because don't forget that the gold that you weave in is woven into
[time=2567] wool and moths love wool and the moths will come and they will eat your clothing and
[time=2574] they will destroy your treasure, they will destroy your wealth.
[time=2578] Jesus says wealth in this life is transient, just look at the moths as they eat the treasure
[time=2584] of your clothing and then he says as we move on that rust will eat up your treasure.
[time=2591] Oh we've all seen rust on a car bumper or a fender, we don't see it so much today but
[time=2597] you used to see rust at work as it would eat the paint and then eat the metal and devour and ruin the metal of an automobile.
[time=2605] Well what he is saying here when he talks about rust in a biblical sense the word rust
[time=2611] means eating to eat or to destroy and it was very common in the time of our Lord to put
[time=2618] our money in gold as we said but also to put it in other commodities such as grain, a way
[time=2624] of storing your wealth or showing off your wealth was to put it into grain and then store
[time=2630] it in the silos and barns and that would be a sign of your wealth and would also be a way of storing all of your wealth.
[time=2638] Remember in Luke chapter 12 the rich man stacked all of the grain into his barns and into the silos and when they got filled to the point where they were just flowing over with grain he said I know what I'll do, I'll tear down my barns and my silos and I'll build larger barns and larger silos oh it was a way to store but the rust that would come referred
[time=2661] there to an eating and the eating of the grain was done by insects and mice and rats and worms
[time=2668] and so Jesus was saying your wealth will be eaten away by the insects that will devour
[time=2674] it he is saying it's transient and of course no one can make their wealth safe from robbers
[time=2681] and thieves.
[time=2683] So Jesus is saying to us today don't put your treasure in things of this life in this world
[time=2690] that will soon be devoured for one day you will pass from this scene and everything will
[time=2696] be left behind.
[time=2698] The story is told of John D. Rockefeller perhaps one of the wealthiest men in the world of
[time=2704] his day by the 1870s he had accumulated millions and millions of dollars in wealth and through
[time=2711] the steel and railroad and oil industry he was able to accumulate millions and millions more before he finally passed away at the time that he passed perhaps he was the world's
[time=2722] richest man the media heard about his death and they rushed down to the standard oil headquarters
[time=2728] in Cleveland, Ohio and they wanted an interview with the press secretary of John D. Rockefeller the man came out and they were asking various questions and finally one of the reporters said alright we got to ask one question how much did old John D. Rockefeller leave behind
[time=2744] when he died today?
[time=2747] The secretary thought for a moment and looked back and said well you know that's really very easy he left all of it.
[time=2755] You see we bring nothing into this world and we take nothing with us and Jesus is saying that all that we have is transient and fleeting and it's futile and when our heart skips just two beats we go out into eternity with nothing whether we be John D. Rockefeller or Jim Pearson
[time=2772] or whoever it might be.
[time=2774] Well he's teaching us a good lesson there but he goes on now with the positive side he says don't store it up in earthly treasures but store up your treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure
[time=2791] is their your heart will be also.
[time=2794] Now what do you suppose Jesus meant when he said store up your treasures in heaven?
[time=2801] Well I believe that what he was saying was this he was saying don't concentrate in this life on building up and storing up all that you can money and possessions that you will
[time=2811] never use or need money and possessions that you stack up to the ceilings for all to see
[time=2817] know he was saying store up treasures in heaven I believe that Jesus was saying use your time use your possessions use your money use your gifts use your talents use all that
[time=2829] you have for building the kingdom of God and he is saying that is what you are to seek
[time=2835] to do the treasure of heaven is to be the single treasure of your life that is the thing
[time=2842] that you are to attempt to do we are to seek to build up treasures in heaven as we lead
[time=2848] others to Christ as we give and further the work of the kingdom as we go about serving in the church he is saying we are building up treasures in heaven and Jesus says we are
[time=2859] to have a single treasure we are to have our eyes fixed upon the treasures of heaven and
[time=2865] not upon this earth now I want to just say before we go on because it needs to be said
[time=2872] that nowhere in scripture does Jesus say that money is wrong and that having wealth is wrong what he is speaking about here is someone who doesn't have money but someone
[time=2883] whose money and possessions have them Jesus in no way says that it's wrong to work hard
[time=2889] and indeed he says it's right to work hard it's right to plan it's right to invest our
[time=2896] money wisely it's right to take care of our families it's right to invest for the future and to plan reasonably for retirement but Jesus is saying that we can get our eyes off of him and get our eyes on the things of the world and when we do then we have lost the
[time=2913] proper treasure Jesus says we are to have a single treasure oh this morning I would ask
[time=2920] all of us to take a look inside of ourselves I thought about it as I prepared this message
[time=2926] and I'm sure that we all think about it from time to time but where is our treasure here's your treasure found the things of the Lord today or do you find yourself like so many of us myself included getting so preoccupied with the things of the world and all that's
[time=2942] there for us to have Jesus says that we're to have a single treasure well Jesus goes on
[time=2949] to speak and to expand on that a little further in verses 22 and 23 we have what I have called
[time=2955] a single vision a single vision Jesus says that we are to have verses 22 and 23 the eye
[time=2964] is the lamp of the body if your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light but if
[time=2971] your eyes are bad your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness Jesus through an illustration here is telling
[time=2984] us that we are to have a single vision now follow me closely because if you're like me when you first looked at that verse you might have wondered what is the symbolism here what is Jesus illustrating when he makes the statement about having a good eye and a bad eye what is it that he's trying to say well follow me closely and I think that the actual explanation is rather clear he is saying here that the eye our eye is the lamp or the
[time=3011] lens of our body it is the only channel where by light enters in to our body and so Jesus
[time=3019] is saying there that the eye is the way in which light enters our body he's using that
[time=3026] as an illustration now of the human heart for it is through the eye of the human heart
[time=3033] that light enters into our soul and so the eye of the body is like the eye of the heart
[time=3040] it allows the light that we gain into our soul and Jesus is saying that all that God
[time=3046] has for us is truth his love his word his goodness will come into us through the eye of
[time=3054] our heart in to our soul but there's some warnings here stay with me a little bit further he
[time=3060] says if your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light what do you mean by
[time=3067] that if your eyes are good that word there could also be translated clear which might be better here but I was also intrigued that we're looking at money and possessions here
[time=3078] and there's a definite nuance to that word of generosity that a part of having a clear
[time=3085] good eye means to be generous in spirit and so Jesus is saying if your eye is good if
[time=3095] the eye of your heart is generous and pure and if it is singularly fixed on Jesus Christ
[time=3103] then it will have clarity and all of the light that God has will flow in through the eye of
[time=3110] your heart and will flood your soul and you will be blessed by the light that God has
[time=3116] for you and so he is saying that we are to keep our heart as the eye to our soul clear
[time=3124] and clean we are to keep about us a generous spirit thinking of others thinking of Christ
[time=3131] and he is saying that when we do that the light of God floods our soul and gives us the blessings that he wants us to have but let's go on and finish the analogy here he
[time=3142] says but if your eyes are bad your whole body will be full of darkness that word there
[time=3150] that's translated bad could also mean diseased or damaged and it's clear now what he is saying
[time=3157] if your eye is clear or damaged by the impurity of your life or by the fact that you are dwelling
[time=3165] upon the things of the world and not the things of God the way of the light to come into your soul will be blocked Jesus is saying that when we go about our lives with a selfish selfish
[time=3179] personal interest only in ourselves when we go through a life without a generous spirit
[time=3186] when we go through life without focusing on the things of God and not on the things of earth he is saying that if we don't focus on him the lens to our soul will be blocked
[time=3198] it will become diseased it will become dirty and those things that come from God will find that they can't work their way into our soul Jesus is making a very strong point here he
[time=3210] is saying that we are to have a single vision he is saying that we are to fix our eyes solely
[time=3217] upon him and he is saying that you cannot fix your heart upon the world and upon me at
[time=3225] the same time let me pull this together and then give you a little illustration but he is saying that the way we look at and use our money is a sure barometer of our spiritual
[time=3236] condition the way that we use our money if we have a generous spirit if we have a loving
[time=3242] generous spirit and are willing to part with our worldly goods for his good and for the kingdom and for others then we will have a clear vision but when we are selfish and self centered that lens will become distorted and blocked he said that we are to be generous
[time=3259] perhaps no other generation has had a tougher fight with this struggle than ours today
[time=3266] we call it the baby boom generation and many of the national magazines in the latter part of the eighties wrote about the greed and the desire of the baby boomers to have everything
[time=3277] that they could have news week in 1988 wrote this it said that baby boomers have entered
[time=3283] a new state of consciousness no no not transcendental meditation type of consciousness but transcendental
[time=3292] acquisition he said that baby boomers have gone and they have taken that commercial that
[time=3299] says grab all the gusto you can they've taken that beer commercial that says who says you
[time=3305] can't have it all and news week said that we have not only believed it but baby boomers
[time=3311] have taken it as their battle cry you know I read that and I began to think and I began
[time=3317] to reflect Jesus says that we are to have not a life of getting and getting and getting
[time=3324] but oh it's so easy to get caught up in that in this world around us in which we live
[time=3330] Jesus says we are to keep a single vision we are not to be greedy self centered and stingy
[time=3337] I remember when I was a young boy a program that I used to watch with my parents it was the Jack Benny show you can watch that show there was never an off color remark or word and a parent could sit with their young child and watch it and it was just funny and Jack Benny had a great reputation for being stingy and greedy and you know the idea was that he'd squeeze a nickel until the buffalo burp before he'd give it up you know well Jack Benny really wasn't all that greedy he actually was a very generous man but I remember one show in particular
[time=3368] where it shows him walking down the street and this robber comes up with a mask on his face and he sticks a gun and Jack Benny's back and he says your money or your life Jack Benny puts his hand on his chin the way he did he doesn't say anything and finally a little while goes by and the robber shakes his gun and says I told you come on come on your money or your life Jack Benny turns and looks at him and says wait a minute I'm thinking about it I'm thinking about it you know we joke about that and Jack Benny was a great
[time=3397] one for that but what he was illustrating was that sometimes it's a struggle between the eternal and the temporal it's a struggle in our lives as to to focus our eyes on Christ
[time=3409] and not upon the things of the world well I guess the question would be today then where are our eyes fixed are our eyes fixed above or our eyes fixed below on things of the world
[time=3422] well thirdly and lastly Jesus says in verses 24 and 25 that we are to have a single master
[time=3430] a single master no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other
[time=3436] or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both God and money
[time=3443] Jesus is saying there that this whole text today this entire picture is a matter of allegiance
[time=3451] he has said that we cannot lay up treasure on heaven and earth at the same time we cannot have a soul focused both in light and darkness and now lastly he says we cannot have two masters
[time=3465] God and Mammon we must focus on one the idea there of master comes from the same word that
[time=3472] we get the biblical word Lord it means absolute ruler and that's an interesting word what
[time=3478] he is saying here the ministry of music today was from our sanctuary choir and our special
[time=3493] guest Stephen Maria Gardner the message was from our associate pastor Jim Pearson if as
[time=3500] a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior before we close I'd like to pray this prayer with you dear heavenly Father I'm thankful that we can come
