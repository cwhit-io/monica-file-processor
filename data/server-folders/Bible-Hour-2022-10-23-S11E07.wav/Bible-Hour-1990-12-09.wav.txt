[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] - A lady was cleaning one morning in the church,
[time=83] preparing it for Sunday morning.
[time=84] She heard some music coming from the church basement, it alarmed her.
[time=87] It sounded like the type of music that was not proper in a church setting.
[time=92] Well, she went and investigated the music and it got louder.
[time=95] She was getting more and more angry as time went on.
[time=98] Finally, she burst into the pastor's office.
[time=100] Pointed her finger at him and said, "Pastor, have you heard the music that's going on in the basement today?" The pastor looked at her and said, "Why no, I haven't, but I'd be glad to go and look at it with you." She looked at him indignantly.
[time=113] Pointed her finger in his face and said, "Pastor, I don't have to go listen to it again.
[time=117] I'm gonna tell you right now if Jesus were to hear that music, he would turn over in his grave." You know this lady obviously had a judgmental spirit.
[time=127] What does the Bible teach about judging others?
[time=130] Is it ever right to judge?
[time=132] Is there a proper way in which to judge?
[time=134] Come with us this morning as we study what Jesus says about judging others.
[time=138] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=153] Thank you for joining us.
[time=155] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=158] Jim's message is entitled "Judging, Just or Jaundiced." Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7, "Judged not, lest ye be judged." Does that mean that we are never to make judgments about one another?
[time=171] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=175] Our text is taken from the book of Matthew chapter 7 verses 1 through 6.
[time=180] Special music today includes a solo from Kevin Rowe, a song from the Men Singers Quartet,
[time=189] and an instrumental duet from Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=194] We now join our service with a song from Reflection entitled "Exult the Name."
[time=224] "The eyes of one's old man cannot be hold his own, all authority is his own."
[time=239] We now join our service with a song from the Men Singers Quartet.
[time=400] [APPLAUSE]
[time=405] That name is above every name and is greater as he that is in you than he that is in the world.
[time=411] Continue speaking of the Lord's name and his glorification 278 please.
[time=417] Glorious things of thee are spoken 278 will be singing verses 1 and 3.
[time=427] Glorious things of thee are spoken 7 are unsaid in our Lord.
[time=521] A song that Kevin Rose is about to sing is an energetic song that says the Lord is good and the Lord is great. Let's listen to Kevin as he sings for us.
[time=541] God is great and God is good. Let us praise him.
[time=550] God is good and God is great. Children gather round the throne and celebrate.
[time=558] God is good. God is great. God is great and God is good.
[time=572] Let us praise him. God is good and God is great. Children gather round the throne and celebrate.
[time=584] God is good. Yes he is. God is great. Is there any reason why we can't lift up his name?
[time=598] He's the one who made us. He's forever more the same. Is there any reason why we can't be filled with joy?
[time=607] So let us sing our praises who are great and mighty Lord. God is great and God is good.
[time=616] Let us praise him. Let us praise him. God is good and God is great. Children gather round the throne
[time=627] and celebrate. God is good. Yes he is. God is great.
[time=634] For in his house are many rooms just waiting to be filled and people of a higher faith following his will.
[time=653] Let us praise him. God is great and God is good. Let us praise him.
[time=666] God is good and God is great. Children gather round the throne and celebrate.
[time=677] God is good. Yes he is. God is so good. Yes well God is good. Oh yes God is great.
[time=706] Good morning and thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. I have with me in the studio our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson. Good morning Jim. Good morning Pete. Nice to have you here on the set again and we look forward to your message in just a few minutes. This is the time of the year Jim when we begin setting up the living Christmas tree. This afternoon as soon as the service is over there'll be a lot of people around setting up the tree. Pete Christmas time is just
[time=732] exciting here at Blackhawk. I love Christmas time but I love it especially here at Blackhawk. The living Christmas tree, the premier dinner, all of the practicing and all the things going on, hundreds of people involved. It's just a lot of fun as we look forward to celebrating the birth of our Lord. Well Jim Christmas is a very fun time for me too because some of the music is just
[time=752] that's written is just the best at Christmas time. If you have tickets I'm glad for that and I hope that you will honor those tickets and come and join with us. We have one concert the very first
[time=763] concert is the premier dinner concert that be held Thursday night December 6th. If you'd like
[time=770] information concerning that special concert please write to Blackhawk Baptist Church or you can call
[time=776] at 4937400 and get information concerning the premier concert on Thursday evening December 6th.
[time=785] Well Jim as we're taping this this is immediately after Thanksgiving and I know that you went home to your relatives in Ohio. Do you have a good time? Had a great time Pete. We went to what I call the Holy Lands. That's Toledo, Ohio. That's where I'm from and we went there with my mother my father passed away a couple of years ago but my wife's mom and dad were there and family and we just had a great time on Thanksgiving Day. Well Jim I'm not sure everyone would call Toledo, Ohio the the Holy Land but we had a good time staying right here in Fort Wayne with our
[time=815] own immediate family and some friends from the church and Gertrude Smires who's one of the super 60s 87 years old she baked one of my favorite pies pecan pie and we had a good time of fellowship.
[time=826] It's great to be with loved ones and friends and just celebrate what God has done for us in this year. We've had some people in our church that have had some trying times but we've also witnessed them trusting in the Lord because of their circumstances. Oh that's for sure Pete it's been a rough year for a lot of people in our church but you know there's something about Thanksgiving drawing our attention to the fact that no matter how dark the times have been we have lots to give thanks for
[time=851] and as we look toward Christmas then following Thanksgiving again we look forward with excitement to celebrating the birth of our Lord. So yeah it's a tough time for some to give thanks but it's
[time=861] a time when we all need to count our blessings. That's true. We always offer something for you
[time=867] that are watching us and we have a book that we've been offering this month entitled What Every Christian Should Know About Growing. It's one thing to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. It's another thing to grow in knowing Jesus Christ and who God is. We'd like to
[time=883] send you this booklet absolutely free of charge if you'll write us today just right to the Bible Hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Once again that's the Bible
[time=898] Hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne Indiana the zip code is 46815. Again we really appreciate it when
[time=909] you write to us and tell us that you're watching the Bible Hour. Jim we had an encouraging letter this week that mentioned you and Tim Teder and how they appreciated your preaching and I'm sure
[time=919] that they're going to look forward to your message today. We're going to go back to the live portion of our service right now. I hope that you'll stay with us for more music and then the message from our associate pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=957] Our God is an awesome God. He reigns from Herod above with wisdom power and love. Our God is an awesome God.
[time=987] Our God reigns, our God reigns, our God reigns with wisdom power and love. Our God reigns and
[time=1014] our God reigns, our God reigns, our God reigns. Our God reigns, our God reigns. Our God is an
[time=1042] awesome God. He reigns from heaven above with wisdom power and love. Our God is an awesome God.
[time=1067] Our God is an awesome God. Our God is an awesome God.
[time=1094] Father, indeed this morning you are an awesome God. Father, as I reflected upon that song I was
[time=1100] thinking of Paul as he spoke on Mars Hill. I was thinking about how he said that God of the universe
[time=1107] cannot ever be kept in a place that's made with human hands. He is the one who created all. He is
[time=1113] the one who sustains all that is. He holds the world in the palm of his hand. Father, I thank you
[time=1119] that you raised up the nations. You set their borders. You put the rulers on the throne.
[time=1125] You were the one who said when rulers would reign and then you would remove them in your own time.
[time=1131] Father, I thank you for the fact that you are an awesome God. That you are in control. That you
[time=1137] rule and rule in the affairs and lives of men. And Father, because you are an awesome God,
[time=1144] we come to you this morning. We come to you praising you that so many could go home from the hospital this week. In time for thanksgiving with family and friends. Father, I thank you that Jane Putt has
[time=1155] gotten better. That therapy will continue but that she can get around with a walker. That her hip is being repaired. That she's back with her family for Thanksgiving weekend. Father, I thank you that
[time=1166] Evelyn Coney has recovered from surgery. That she could be home. That Bill Goodwin would recover from bypass surgery and would be home with family and friends. But Father, we come to you this morning
[time=1178] on behalf of another family and Father, we pray for them. Father, I would pray for the living
[time=1184] waters missionary church in Elkhart, Indiana and the loss of a youth pastor, only 29 years old,
[time=1191] killed in a car crash this weekend. Father, I pray for that church. More than that, I pray for
[time=1198] the family of that youth pastor, that you would rally around them. Father, I pray for his wife
[time=1204] as she's still in the hospital. Father, I just ask that you would wrap your arms around that church, wrap your arms around that family, give them the comfort, the strength. Show them anew that you
[time=1215] are in control. We don't always understand, but Father, we know that you are there. And Father,
[time=1221] I would pray for Greg Handel this morning. I pray that you would heal his body. Father, I would pray for strength. And I just pray that you would reach down with your healing touch and touch him now. Father, we come to you boldly because we know that you are an awesome God,
[time=1236] but we come to you, always submitting to you and to your will in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1255] [MUSIC - 84 seconds]
[time=1363] Thank you, Dave. Thank you, Debbie, for that beautiful number. Well, as Pete said tonight,
[time=1386] Scott Quales will be preaching. We look forward to that. Look forward to having you back tonight.
[time=1391] We'll be having communion. I remember the first time as the men singers were singing, my mind wandered. And I began to think about the first time I preached at Blackhawk. And I remember coming
[time=1403] down from the platform and seeing that I had preached for 38 minutes. And I said to one of my
[time=1409] friends, I said, "Well, I think I went a little long. I preached 38 minutes." And they looked at me and said, "It was 44." So, but come tonight. It's always exciting to hear someone preaching the word
[time=1419] and always the time to enjoy the music, the fellowship, and of course, the Lord's table in communion. Well, let's pray one more time and ask the Lord to bless these moments together.
[time=1429] Father, thank you for your word. Thank you that we can open it now. And Father, I just asked that
[time=1435] you would bless all of us here. Prepare our hearts, prepare our minds, prepare our ears in Christ's name.
[time=1442] Amen. A famous Midwestern pastor, well-known nationally, tells the story. He was in his study
[time=1450] one day at work, and there was a lady who was in the church, and she was cleaning, getting ready for the Sunday morning church. She was cleaning, and as she cleaned, she heard some music coming
[time=1461] out of the basement of the church, and the music was of such a type that it alarmed her a little bit. In fact, it made her angry. She tried to ignore it, but the music seemed to get louder, and she investigated and saw that some of the church youth group were playing this music in the basement of the church, and well, quite frankly, she was offended by it. Well, she felt that it was not appropriate music for a church. As the music continued, she continued to listen, but she continued to get more and more indignant. Finally, she burst into the pastor's office,
[time=1491] walked up to him, put her finger in his face, and said, "Pastor, have you heard that awful music that's playing in the church basement today?" The pastor looked up at her and calmly said, "Well, no, but if you'd like, I'll go out there with you, and we could listen to it together." She said, "No, pastor, I don't have to do that." And then she put her hands on her hips and said, "Why, pastor, if Jesus heard that music today, he would turn over in his grave." Well, I don't so much want to quibble with that lady's theology this morning, although I wonder
[time=1523] why nobody ever told her the other half of the story. But what I want to talk about this morning is the fact that that lady was guilty of something else, guilty of something that the Bible calls
[time=1533] judging others, judging others with a critical spirit, judging the heart, the motives of others,
[time=1540] making a value judgment, and then critically expressing it to her pastor that morning.
[time=1545] You know, Jesus spoke a lot in his word about judging. There was nothing wrong with that lady
[time=1551] feeling that the music was inappropriate that day. There was nothing wrong with that lady feeling that that music shouldn't be played in her church. Oh, she had a right to her opinions and her own feelings. But the sin that she committed was in the spirit with which she conveyed her
[time=1567] feelings to others, and the judgmental spirit that she took toward those youth that were listening to that music and toward her pastor for not being as indignant as what she was. Jesus spoke about
[time=1579] judging. Jesus spoke about the Pharisees and told the story of the Pharisee and the tax gatherer who went into the temple, and he talked about the Pharisee who stood up proudly and said, "God, thank you that I'm not like this tax gatherer. Thank you that I'm not a sinner like him.
[time=1594] Thank you that I fast every week. I give a tenth of all my money. I give my time. I do all of these
[time=1600] things. God, thank you that I'm not like that sinner." Jesus said that was a judgmental spirit,
[time=1607] and he attacked the Pharisees for that. James spoke about having a judgmental spirit.
[time=1613] James said that when we judge others, when we judge others vindictively and sometimes even
[time=1619] viciously, we take God off of the throne as the righteous God of the universe and judge, and we place ourselves on the throne as judge, and we hold ourselves up higher than what we should.
[time=1631] James said, "Don't do that. There is only one judge, and he is God." And he has given that judgment
[time=1637] to the Son. The Bible talks a lot about judgment. And I want to say this morning that in Scripture,
[time=1645] Jesus does not say that all judging is wrong. Jesus has given us a heart. He's given us a mind,
[time=1651] and he wants us to use it. Jesus has told us to judge. He's told us to use our discernment.
[time=1658] He's told us to use our minds and our hearts, and he's told us to use his word. And he's told us
[time=1664] to carefully listen to what people say, to carefully look upon others. Oh, there's nothing wrong with
[time=1671] that. We all make judgments. And sometimes I believe Christ even shows us that it's proper to be
[time=1677] critical when it's conveyed in a proper manner. But what he is angry about in the Scripture that
[time=1684] day with the Pharisees and what he teaches us this morning is that a vindictive, judgmental,
[time=1690] negative spirit toward others on the part of a believer is wrong. Indeed, he says it's sin.
[time=1697] In the seventh chapter of the book of Matthew, Jesus gives us perhaps his most familiar passage
[time=1704] concerning judgment. I'd like you to turn to that with me, if you would, the seventh chapter of the book of Matthew. And as you do that this morning, I want us to see three reasons, three reasons why judging with a critical spirit is improper. Indeed, it's wrong.
[time=1722] Perhaps it's even sin. Three reasons why improper judging of others is sin and God's eyes. And then
[time=1732] lastly, this morning, I want us to look at a balanced perspective, a balanced biblical perspective
[time=1738] of a proper method of judging. Let's look at the passage this morning. Jesus says, do not judge
[time=1745] in verse one, do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others,
[time=1751] you will be judged. And with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the
[time=1758] speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
[time=1762] How can you say to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye, when all the time there is
[time=1768] a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite. First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will
[time=1774] see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. Do not give dogs what is sacred. Do not throw
[time=1780] your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you
[time=1787] to pieces. Well, the first thing that I'd like to point out to us this morning, the first reason why
[time=1793] I believe that Jesus is telling us that judging others is sin, is the fact that it reveals an
[time=1800] improper view of God. When we take a harsh critical attitude toward others, when we impose on others
[time=1808] a critical judgmental spirit, I believe that it reveals in us an improper view of who truly God is.
[time=1817] Notice in this verse that Jesus reminds them right away when he says do not judge or you too
[time=1824] will be judged. Jesus is telling those Pharisees very quickly that there is only one judge,
[time=1831] there is only one final court, there is only one who has the right to sit in judgment
[time=1837] over the hearts and lives of people, and that is not you, he says, it is God. I believe that when we
[time=1845] take a judgmental spirit and impose it upon the lives of others, that we are in our own way taking
[time=1852] God off the throne and elevating ourselves up to a position of judge and the Bible is plain,
[time=1860] that we are not to do that. When we assume the role of God, we are viewing our Lord as less than what He demands, indeed less than what He deserves. James spoke about that. He said that when we sit in
[time=1872] judgment as human beings, then we sit in judgment upon the law, indeed upon God, and we take Him off the throne and put ourselves there as judge. Oh, he says we're not to do that.
[time=1884] He said that we are to give Him the homage that God so richly deserves. You know, I believe that
[time=1892] our concept of God, our view of who God is, determines many ways how we behave and how we act
[time=1901] toward others. I believe that it's very important for us to have the proper view of the biblical God,
[time=1908] because as the song said this morning, He is an awesome God. And when we come into His presence and view Him as that awesome sovereign God of the universe, then I believe we aren't tempted to judge
[time=1921] because we realize that it's God's position to be the righteous judge. You know, I think we have to be careful because I think in our society today, our view of God is being influenced by many others.
[time=1933] Outside of church and society, there are those who would say that God is a God of love and that
[time=1939] there is no other side to the God of the universe, that God is all love, that God is going to bless
[time=1945] everyone, take everyone to heaven someday, and there's no reason to worry about reverenting Him.
[time=1951] He just loves everybody. There are others in society who will say that God is only a stern,
[time=1957] judgmental God, that He is only one who punishes and heaps judgment and punishment upon others.
[time=1963] Oh, that's also a wrong perspective because the God of the Bible is a loving God. But others in
[time=1969] society give us a wrong view. There are others who will say that the God of the universe, if there
[time=1975] is one they will say cannot be a God who is all powerful or in control, because they will say, why are there people starving in Ethiopia? Why isn't that there is what is going on in the Middle East today? Oh, the Bible teaches that that is wrong. But you know, even within the church,
[time=1991] there's criticism of the biblical God and waffling as to what the Bible says about Him.
[time=1997] I heard a comment this week that was made by a church leader who attacked fundamentalists and evangelicals for he said teaching that there was no other way to God
[time=2008] besides Jesus Christ. Remember the church taking God off the throne and criticizing others
[time=2016] for their view of God. The cults, the New Age movement, has invaded the church, I believe,
[time=2024] in some ways and they are teaching a position concerning God that is not biblical and if embraced
[time=2031] by believers, changes our concept and our correct view of God. I read this week excerpts from a
[time=2038] couple of books. The first one I don't recommend you buy. It was a book by Shirley McLean. I then went to another bookstore and I read excerpts from another book and in there there was an interview
[time=2050] with a lady by the name of Linda Goodman, a New Age astrologer and author. And in this magazine interview, she was asked the question to describe her version of the second coming of the Messiah.
[time=2063] This is what she wrote. The second coming is not going to be a barefooted man floating down in a
[time=2070] white robe. The second coming is in each heart when each man and each woman realizes that I too
[time=2077] am a Messiah. She went on to say Messiah. This is her definition. I am he. She is me. He is her.
[time=2088] I am she. He is me. We are all God. All equal to God, this lady says, in her New Age perspective
[time=2098] of who God is. Believe it's dangerous for us as this begins to invade thinking and becomes popular
[time=2105] and writing that we don't waver one bit as to who the God of the Bible is. Another one as I was
[time=2112] sitting in the bookstore this week looking at the New Age bookshelf caught my attention. I thought it was a joke. I thought it was tongue in cheek. Then I started to read it and I found out it was entirely true. The book was titled What Sign Is Your Pet? What Sign Is Your Pet? It was by a New
[time=2130] Age veterinarian. Whatever that is. The idea was if you could figure out what sign your pet was.
[time=2139] If you could determine when he was born, what sign he was, that would help you to determine how to better help your pet behave. This is some of the things that this gentleman wrote. Does she lie
[time=2151] down while eating? Your dog's a torus. Does he treat your house like it's his castle? He's definitely
[time=2160] a Leo. Does she seem almost human in her ability to sense your emotions? She's a cancer. Does he
[time=2168] blissfully ignore your commands and please? He's not deaf. He's an Aquarius. I've got two boys at home
[time=2175] that must be an Aquarius. I didn't know that was their sign. I don't pay much attention to that. In fact, I get rather angry when people ask me what sign I was born under. I always feel like saying something like Texaco or something like that. But the new age view of the biblical God is so
[time=2196] wrong. Well, the Bible says that the God of the Bible, the God of the Bible, is a strong God.
[time=2204] He is an all-powerful God. Beloved, the Bible says that no man is co-equal with God. The Bible
[time=2210] says that no man may stand in judgment. That's gods and gods alone. The Bible says that God is
[time=2216] an awesome God, the one who created the universe, who sustains the universe and who holds the universe
[time=2222] right here in the palm of his hand. And at any moment, through his own decision, will determine
[time=2229] our future. The biblical God is the only one who was omnipresent, who was omniscient, all-knowing,
[time=2235] omnipotent, all-powerful, ever-present. The God of the Bible is the only one.
[time=2242] The God of the Bible is not a bumbling old man who looks like George Burns.
[time=2248] But the God of the Bible is the powerful, awesome God that we see repeatedly throughout scripture.
[time=2257] Oh, why do I say all of that? I say it to say this. I believe that when Peter says that we are
[time=2263] to come into the presence of God reverently and with fear and trembling, I believe that we are
[time=2269] to come before God just in that way. I believe that we are to come daily before him, commune with him,
[time=2275] come to him and worship him as the sovereign Almighty God that he is and that he deserves
[time=2282] and demands. And I believe that if I come to God daily in that way, if I come to worship him
[time=2288] in that way, then rather than trying to usurp his throne and take over as a judge,
[time=2295] I'm only going to want to do what he has called me to do. And that's to share his word,
[time=2301] to share his love with others, to take his word to everyone that I come in contact with.
[time=2307] Oh, I would pray that we would maintain a strong view of the biblical God as the one in control.
[time=2315] Proclaim it, present it, teach it. I believe that it keeps us humble. It keeps us from judging others.
[time=2323] I believe that when we judge others, we reveal an improper view of the biblical God.
[time=2330] Then secondly, this morning, I believe that when we judge others, it reveals an improper view of other
[time=2336] people and improper view of other people. You know, it has been my experience that when I have
[time=2343] interacted for periods of time with those who I determine seem to be awful, critical,
[time=2349] judgmental and harsh in their spirit, that generally they believe that somehow they are better than
[time=2356] those that they are critical of. You know, the Pharisees felt that they were not going to receive
[time=2362] any judgment because they felt they were righteous in God's eyes. I know it sounds harsh, but I believe
[time=2368] that sometimes those that are the most critical are those who believe that they're somehow better than others and that somehow judgment is not reserved for them because they're better than those that they come in contact with and they're in the business of straightening other people out.
[time=2384] Well, Jesus kind of brings that person right back to the ground, I believe very quickly, because in the next verse in verse two, he says, "For in the same way that you judge others, you will be judged." What is Jesus saying there? He is saying no one is better than anyone else.
[time=2400] No one has the right to ever think that they are better or above judgment or above any type of
[time=2406] future judgment. He is saying that when you judge others, when you judge others in a critical negative
[time=2413] spirit or I do or anyone does, that we one day will be judged for our actions. Now, that's not a
[time=2420] judgment unto salvation. That's not a judgment unto salvation. That was fixed at the time that we believed and embraced Jesus Christ and our eternal salvation was locked in place forever.
[time=2432] Oh, the Bible teaches that I believe very clearly. But the Bible also teaches in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 that there will be a judgment seat where the believer will stand and where our works will be judged. And I believe that Jesus is saying when we go through this life with a critical judgmental spirit thinking that we're better than others, one day we will stand in judgment for that
[time=2453] with loss of reward or just the shame of knowing that we have made our God unhappy with us.
[time=2459] Second problem reveals an improper view of others, an improper view of others.
[time=2468] You may have heard this story. It was popular some time back but totally imaginary.
[time=2473] But there were four men on an airplane who were flying across the country. One of them was supposed to be President Bush and another was Henry Kissinger. Another was a local minister and another was a
[time=2484] boy scout. Well, they were flying through the air and all of a sudden they saw the two pilots
[time=2490] with parachutes on go running through the plane and jump out one of the windows. Well, they looked around and realized what is going on. They looked and there were only three parachutes left in the plane and there were four of them. They didn't know what they were going to do. Well, the story goes that President Bush got up and said, "Well, I hate to say this but I need to take one of those
[time=2510] parachutes and jump out because you know I am the most important man in the free world. I am so important. My country needs me. I need to be one of the men who takes the parachute and he grabbed one of the parachutes and jumped out of the plane." Well, the other three just sat there looking at the two parachutes that were left and wondering. Finally, Henry Kissinger stood up and said,
[time=2530] "I should have one of the parachutes after all. I am the smartest man in all the world. The world needs me because of my great intellect." And with that, Henry Kissinger picked up one of the parachutes and jumped out the window of the plane. Well, the minister looked at the young boy scout,
[time=2546] smiling. He said, "You know, son, I have served the Lord all my life. I have lived a good life.
[time=2551] I have lived. I have had a great life. But you are just a young boy. You take the last parachute.
[time=2558] You save yourself." The boy scout looked up at the boy and he said, "Pastor, there is not going to be any reason to have to do that. You see, the smartest man in the world just took my knapsack and jumped out of the window." When we think that we are better than others,
[time=2576] more important than others in God's eyes, more important to the human race, I believe that we have an improper view of others. The Bible teaches that we are in no way better
[time=2587] than any other person. Believe that we need to be careful. Others are not under us and we need to
[time=2593] remember always never to think that someone is less important than us in God's eyes, that someone
[time=2599] is less of a believer. Oh, there are different levels of Christian maturity. But may we always
[time=2605] never think of ourselves as being better than someone else because of something that we see in their motives or we try to judge their heart and determine that somehow we can be that righteous
[time=2616] judge. Well, it's an improper view of God, an improper view of others. Thirdly, it's an improper
[time=2622] view of ourselves. Let's go on and look at verses three through the very first part of verse five
[time=2628] and we will see that it is an improper view of ourselves. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust
[time=2634] in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye, Jesus said. How can you say
[time=2641] to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own. I believe that when we have an improper view of God, an improper view of others,
[time=2653] that an improper view of ourselves is just going to naturally come because we're going to realize
[time=2659] and begin to believe that somehow we're superior to someone else and he teaches us that that is wrong.
[time=2667] To judge critically is to have an improper view of ourselves. An improper view of God leads
[time=2673] to all of these. Let's look at this verse and see. What do you say? Jesus says, why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
[time=2682] This is interesting. I was doing a little study on this this week. This word that is translated here speck of sawdust, actually the Greek word there means a twig or a splinter. And when we read
[time=2693] that it would seem that Christ was saying, why do you look at the very small sin in your brother's eye and miss the large sin in your own life? But I think maybe what he is saying is if we think of that splinter being something which could be very painful in an eye and something which could be very
[time=2709] large in a small little organ like a human eye. I think he is saying, why do you overlook the large
[time=2716] sin or why do you look only at the large sin in your brother's life but you miss the gigantic sin,
[time=2723] the beam that is in your own life. I don't think the difference here is small and large. It's between large and even greater. Now I believe that Jesus is teaching that when we do this, when we fail to see
[time=2736] the beam in our own eye that we are being judgmental and self-righteous, the sin I believe that Jesus
[time=2744] is speaking about here is that of self-righteousness because self-righteousness by its very definition
[time=2752] is thinking that somehow as ourselves we are above others and we tend to want to be critical of others
[time=2758] and not see the faults in our own eye. We want to see the twig in theirs but not the beam that's in our
[time=2766] own. I've told this story before on a Sunday evening but let me repeat it again this morning.
[time=2772] Seems there were two Christian men that were partners in a dry goods store and they were in their store one Saturday morning when a beautiful Lincoln Continental with a beautiful horse trailer on the back pulled up to their dry goods store. A lady got out obviously well dressed and wealthy, walked into the store, walked up to one of the Christian men and said, "I want to buy the finest horse blanket that you have in your store." Well the two men only had one pile of horse blankets.
[time=2798] They were all worth ten dollars and so the man went into the back room, picked up one of the ten dollar horse robes, went over, showed a tour and said, "Oh, this blanket is the most beautiful
[time=2810] blanket you will ever find. It is so beautiful. I'll let you have it for ten dollars." The lady
[time=2816] looked at him and said, "My good man, I'll have you know that money is no object. Money is no object here today. I want the finest horse blanket money can buy." The man thought for a moment said, "Okay."
[time=2827] Went back, took another blanket right out of that same pile of blankets, marked ten dollars, walked out and said, "Man, this is the finest blanket you will find anywhere in America. Handmade,
[time=2837] handcrafted, of the finest wool. Oh, it's beautiful. Your horse will win with this blanket. I'll let
[time=2843] you have it for fifty dollars." The woman looked at him again and said, "My good man, I've told you now and I'm going to tell you again. Money is no object. I want the finest blanket money can buy." Man thought for a moment, went back, went back to the same pile of horse blankets, marked ten dollars, took another collar out, walked up and said, "Here, ma'am, the finest horse blanket in the entire world. Hand woven by battle winds in Arabia. It is the most beautiful horse blanket you'll ever
[time=2870] find and I'll let you have this for the bargain price of three hundred dollars." The lady said, sold and happily paid him with three hundred dollar bills, walked out of the store, got into her car and drove away. Man, I was just kind of standing smirking. His partner walked up to him and
[time=2887] said, "How could you possibly do what you just did? You're a Christian. How could you ever cheat
[time=2894] that lady the way you did?" The man looked at his partner and jumped back and said, "My good man, I'll have you know. I didn't cheat her. I was merely following what scripture says to do." The man looked at him and said, "Following scripture, how can you take what you just did to the Bible?"
[time=2910] He said very simply, Matthew chapter 25 verse 43, "I saw a stranger and I took her in."
[time=2916] You know, when we are self righteous, when we exal ourselves up above others,
[time=2924] we fail to see the sins in our own life and maybe even when we do, we try to hide them or we just
[time=2931] don't want to see them clearly. The Bible teaches that when we have a judgmental spirit, we have an
[time=2938] improper view of ourselves, an improper view of the way that we should be. Well, this morning,
[time=2947] I believe that like James says in his epistle, "We need all to take time to look in the mirror."
[time=2953] We all need to take time daily to look into the mirror, but not the mirror to look in our face, but the mirror of our soul. Jesus goes on to say here that we should pay, he says, "You pay no
[time=2965] attention to the plank in your eye." In the King James, it says, "You do not notice." Those words
[time=2971] talk or mean a clear, long, deep glance, one that takes time and introspective look into
[time=2980] our lives. Jesus is saying that we need to look at our lives, look at our lives and examine ourselves
[time=2987] to see where the sin is in our own lives before we reach out and try to straighten out our brother
[time=2993] on the sin in his life. And I think there's one point there that needs to be made, and that is, I'm not talking about some type of spiritual autopsy. I don't think that it's right for us to be so introspective to look at our sins and the things that we see in our lives so much and to dwell on
[time=3009] them so much that we lose our spirit and our willingness to go out and serve the Lord. Now,
[time=3015] I believe we need to look to see them, to confess them, to put them behind us and then go out in
[time=3022] victory and witness and minister for the Lord. Well, three reasons why an improper view of ourselves,
[time=3031] God or others, is a sign of judging. Lastly this morning, I want us to see a proper biblical perspective
[time=3040] concerning judging, a balanced perspective. What is the right way for us to go about judging others?
[time=3047] Well, I think he gives that to us in the second portion of verse 5 and verse 6. You, hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck
[time=3058] from your brother's eye. The first point he makes is the first point of preparation is that we are
[time=3065] to remove the plank out of our own eye. Take the plank out of your own eye. What is he saying there?
[time=3072] He is saying that we are to look at our life. We are to look at the sins in our lives that we have committed. We are to take a intense look at ourselves. Find out what it is that would not be
[time=3083] pleasing to God and then confess it before him. To cleanse ourselves by taking that sin to God,
[time=3089] asking for his forgiveness, for his cleansing. And Jesus says that's the first step in a proper
[time=3095] biblical perspective of judging others. Look at yourself. Take the plank out of your own eye.
[time=3102] Get the sin out of your own life. Humbly go before God. Humbly go before God. Confess your sin and only then will you be prepared to judge others. But notice what else he says here.
[time=3114] He says, take the plank out of your own eye because then you will see clearly. What does he mean?
[time=3123] See clearly there. Does he mean that we will be able to see clearly the fault of our brother?
[time=3128] Does he mean that we will be able to see clearly all of the faults in our brother's life if we have taken the sin out of our own? I don't think that's what he means there.
[time=3136] I believe that Jesus meant that we will see everything clearly. We will see in a better light God and who he is. We will see others as people that need the Lord and not someone to be condemned.
[time=3147] We will see other believers and brothers as fellow brothers in the Lord, not something less than us, but equal to us in the sight of God as believers in God's kingdom. I believe that we
[time=3158] confess our sins and then we can see clearly the whole picture part of which is the sin in our brother's
[time=3166] life. And then he says then you will be able to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
[time=3172] What did he mean that by that? I believe that he was saying after we have prepared our hearts,
[time=3179] after we have prepared our lives, after we have prepared our spirit, then and only then can we
[time=3185] meekly, can we humbly, can we with fear and trembling go to our brother or sister in the Lord
[time=3193] or to an unbeliever that we want to speak with. Only then are we proper in our approach to them
[time=3199] in judging. Can we judge? Yes, we can. The Bible indeed teaches that we are to judge.
[time=3207] We are to use the faculties that God has given us. We are to use a discerning spirit. We are to
[time=3213] think carefully, remove the sin from our own lives. And then we are to filter through God's
[time=3220] Word and filtered through what God shows us and teaches us. We are to approach our brother in a loving way. The Bible teaches that when we do that and our brother comes back and we have
[time=3231] one our brother and he says that is the way that we are to do it. My younger brother is a high school
[time=3238] football coach in the city where I grew up. In fact, he's a coach at the high school that I went to.
[time=3242] And I know the routine very well. They play a game on Friday night or Saturday morning. They
[time=3248] videotape every single play and within a couple of hours of the game being over, all the coaches are together in one room viewing the videotape late into the night, late into the night going over everything. All of the plays, every miss block, every miss tackle, every incomplete pass,
[time=3264] every error that the team made. They look carefully at the tape of their own team. They watch it over
[time=3271] and over and over again. Then when they've done that, they go out to practice on Monday and they
[time=3278] relate to the kids and they watch the films again with the players and they relate to them the mistakes and point out the errors that they made and they show them how their team, they individually
[time=3289] and their team could be better if they wouldn't make the mistakes that they made. Then and only
[time=3295] then do they go to the shelf or to another team and get the videotape of another team and the games
[time=3301] that they have played and they begin to study the tape, the movie of their next opponent and they
[time=3307] begin to study his weaknesses, his mistakes, his errors and all of those things. I believe that
[time=3315] that illustrates very well the method which we are to use in judging others. To look at our own
[time=3321] videotape first, our own lives, our own errors, our own mistakes, our own sins and then and only
[time=3328] after that when we have brought it to our own attention and dealt with them. Can we then look at the videotape of another believer's life or another's life and humbly and meekly go to them
[time=3340] and deal with the speck that is in their eyes? Oh Jesus has given us a balanced perspective on
[time=3347] judgment but that's not where he finishes. Notice he goes on and gives us a very difficult verse but it's all a part of this balanced view of judgment. In verse 6 he says, "Do not give dogs
[time=3357] what is sacred. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet
[time=3363] and then turn and tear you to pieces." This is what we call in the Bible one of the hard sayings of
[time=3371] Jesus. It seems to be very harsh and it's very difficult to see exactly what Christ meant by that
[time=3377] but it's tacked right on to this verse following when he talks about the proper way of engaging
[time=3383] in judgment. I believe that what he was telling them was this. Let me first set it up. Dogs and pigs
[time=3390] in the time of our Lord were generally not domesticated animals. They roam throughout the cities and
[time=3397] packs. They went around and scavenged food from the dump and as wild hungry dogs and swine,
[time=3404] if someone got in their way, someone got between them and their food, they would tear you apart if that's what it took. They were going to have that food. They were going to have them. They were vicious animals in that day. Of course the Jews would have nothing to do with swine because they
[time=3419] considered them to be a filthy animal. Now what does that have to do with judging? Well I believe
[time=3425] that what Jesus was saying, and I admit that it sounds harsh, but he is saying that as you in your own mind use your discernment and you use your judgment and then you go to some, some who will
[time=3437] not be believers, some who are not open to the things of God, there will be times that you will share the gospel, you will share God's word, you will share a word perhaps of rebuke. And because
[time=3449] those people do not have God as their Lord, they will turn on you, they possibly may get vicious,
[time=3457] they will be insulted by you, they will insult you back, and I believe that Jesus is preparing them
[time=3463] for the day when that might happen. It happened to Paul.
[time=3478] It's been our privilege today to share our music from Reflection, The Men's Singers,
