[time=55] We spend a lot of time waiting.
[time=58] And often this kind of waiting is not the kind of waiting we enjoy.
[time=62] It's estimated that the average American will spend six months of their lifetime waiting in a stoplight, and five years of their life waiting in some line.
[time=71] But sometimes we find ourselves in the kind of waiting that we actually enjoy.
[time=76] That's what we're going to talk about this morning.
[time=78] I hope you'll join us as we talk about an eager anticipation for the best thing in life.
[time=84] [MUSIC]
[time=94] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=99] Thank you for joining us.
[time=101] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Tim Teder.
[time=104] Tim's message is entitled "Anticipation." What are you waiting for?
[time=110] Are you anticipating the best thing in life?
[time=113] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Luke.
[time=117] Our text is taken from chapter 2, verse 25 and 26.
[time=123] Special music today includes a solo from Brian Losen and Denise Mitchell.
[time=131] We now join our service with a song from Brian Losen.
[time=136] [MUSIC]
[time=142] Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining.
[time=151] It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.
[time=159] [MUSIC]
[time=164] All the way the world in sin and error pining.
[time=172] Till he appeared and the soul held its word.
[time=180] A thrill of hope, though weary world rejoices for yonder breaks.
[time=191] A new and glorious war to crawl on your knees.
[time=203] Oh, holy the angel voices, oh night divine, oh night.
[time=222] When Christ was born, oh night divine.
[time=232] Oh night divine.
[time=243] [MUSIC]
[time=249] Holy taught us to love one another, his law is love, and his gospel is peace.
[time=268] Change shall he brave, for the slave is our brother, and in his name all oppression shall speak.
[time=285] Sweet hymns of joy, in grateful chorus, raise with what all within us, raise his holy name.
[time=301] Oh, and your knees, oh here the angel voices, oh night divine, oh night.
[time=327] When Christ was born, oh night, divine, oh night, oh night divine.
[time=353] [MUSIC]
[time=358] Thank you, Brian.
[time=361] Oh, how I love Jesus, there is a name I love to hear.
[time=364] I love to sing its word, hymn number 529.
[time=368] This is a testimony from us to the Lord, because he first loved me, 529.
[time=375] [MUSIC]
[time=389] There is a name I love to hear, I love to sing its word, and sounds I hear who take it by you.
[time=400] Oh, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus for me.
[time=421] He tells me I'll sing it all, oh God who's every King, he tells me I'll write his word, he'll sing it more than me.
[time=438] Oh, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus for me.
[time=455] He tells me I'll write his word, he tells me I'll write his word, he tells me I'll sing it more than me.
[time=471] Oh, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus for me.
[time=489] He tells me I'll write his word, he tells me I'll write his word, he tells me I'll write his word, he tells me I'll sing it more than me.
[time=505] Oh, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus for me.
[time=524] Just put your hymnal away please, if you'll stand and greet one another and then we're going to sing the chorus one more time. Just tell those people around you that you're glad that they're here.
[time=548] Oh, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus, how I love Jesus for me.
[time=566] Thank you very much, you may be seated. We continue with music now as Denise Mitchell comes to sing. The song is entitled "Someone Up There Loves Me." We know that's our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=596] [MUSIC] Staring at the cross road where the long and winding road cuts across the straight and narrow way. I know which way to turn. I know exactly where to go. Cause the Lord is with me every single day.
[time=621] â™ª And when times get hard as he left me all alone. Oh, no, he's right beside me and when I'm leaving. And all my strength is gone and he takes my hand and lives me all.
[time=644] He's watching over me every day. He's watching what I do when we're safe. He's watching over me every day. I know that someone's out there. And he's watching after me.
[time=663] I feel a little bit like Daniel. Trapped inside a lion's tail. And at the darkest hour when it's more than I can handle. Someone comes and rescues me again.
[time=690] Is it close again? Or just a light that shines my way? Oh, no, I don't believe it. I recognize his hands in everything I see and in every way. He's watching over me every day.
[time=718] He's watching what I do when we're safe. He's watching over me every day. I know that someone's out there. And he's watching after me.
[time=734] He's watching over me every day. He's watching what I do when we're safe. He's watching what I do when we're safe.
[time=763] He's watching over me every day. He's watching what I do when we're safe. He's watching what I do when we're safe. And he's watching over me every day. I know that someone's out there.
[time=790] He's watching over me every day. He's watching what I do when I'm safe. He's watching what I do when we're safe. He's watching over me every day. He's watching over me every day. He's watching what I do when we're safe.
[time=820] [APPLAUSE]
[time=825] Good morning and thank you for watching the Bible Hour today. We're entering into the Christmas season and no doubt many of you are very busy preparing for families that might be living far away that are coming in for Christmas.
[time=837] And also you might have noted that the living Christmas tree is up. Many of our volunteers have been working this week in preparation for the concerts that will be coming up.
[time=847] We hope that we'll see many of you here at our living Christmas tree concerts this year.
[time=852] The Founders Club has been the backbone of the television program, the Bible Hour, and has been a great support financially to us. And we're very grateful for those of you that are members of the Founders Club.
[time=863] You'll be receiving in the mail a letter telling you about the financial status of the Bible Hour. We are a little bit behind about the same as we were last year at this time.
[time=873] So we hope that you will consider giving a year-end gift if you have that ability.
[time=877] Also in appreciation for your faithful giving and the support of the Bible Hour, you'll be receiving a special gift from the Bible Hour in the dear future.
[time=886] Thank you again for joining with us and helping us present the Bible Hour from week to week.
[time=892] This morning our message is from our Associate Pastor Tim Teder and Tim is with me today. Good morning Tim.
[time=898] Good morning Pete.
[time=899] Tim, tell us a little bit about your message this morning.
[time=902] Well Pete, you mentioned that Christmas season is on us and it's my favorite time of year.
[time=908] I can remember anticipating Christmas morning as a child and all the thrill that went along with that.
[time=915] I think it might be some thing of the same thing that maybe Simeon in the New Testament felt as he anticipated the coming Messiah.
[time=922] So we want to look at his life and what his anticipation meant and what it can mean to us today.
[time=927] Tim, I can agree with you. It's a great time of the year to celebrate the birth of our Savior and just realize that that was just the very beginning of all the things that God did for us.
[time=937] You're involved so much with the youth program here and we don't see them a lot on television.
[time=942] I know they're going to be on in a couple weeks and you have a program even tonight here at the church.
[time=947] Tell us what the youth are doing these days.
[time=949] Well, as you mentioned this evening, some of our student leaders are going to be sharing the ministries they've been involved in.
[time=956] We have students involved at a local hospital doing a children's program every Sunday morning.
[time=961] We have students involved in outreach and visitation, doing our youth letter, a number of ministries.
[time=965] They're going to be talking about that tonight along with some of our students also talking about summer ministry,
[time=971] missions trips that they went on this past summer.
[time=974] And then the living Christmas tree in a couple weeks, the viewers will be able to see the students in the living Christmas tree
[time=981] singing a Christmas song and they're looking forward to that too.
[time=984] Tim, when we're around here, kids mention servant teams.
[time=988] Tell us just a little bit about how that separates the kids with a little more responsibility for these kids.
[time=994] The servant team is a group of about 30 high school students who just want to put themselves in a position of accountability.
[time=1002] A little more accountable in the spiritual growth, the relationship with Jesus Christ, and they also take on more responsibility in service and ministry through our youth program
[time=1013] and also in discipling and building relationship with other students.
[time=1017] And that's a lot of excitement involved in that whole program.
[time=1020] I've heard parents talk about the growth that they've seen in their own children because of that and I think that's good to get the kids involved that way and we appreciate the ministry of the youth.
[time=1030] It's a growing program and certainly young people today need that stability that they find among their peers.
[time=1036] Just a few minutes we'll be going back to our live service, but I'd like to tell you about a book.
[time=1042] This is the last time we'll be offering this book.
[time=1045] What every Christian should know about growing and I hope that you will write this week.
[time=1050] This is the last time we'll offer this book.
[time=1053] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1060] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1064] Once again, the title of the book is "What Every Christian Should Know About Growing" and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1075] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1079] Thank you very much Tim for joining me today and we look forward to your message in a few moments.
[time=1084] We go back to the live broadcast now as we listen to more music.
[time=1088] Thank you again for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=1102] Sunday morning sunshine, waving the land.
[time=1110] Sunday morning people with bibles in their hands.
[time=1118] He wonders why they pass him by and walk around him on the street
[time=1125] to shade the light that replaced the night. He cups his hand to see.
[time=1135] In the shadow of this people, someone's crying.
[time=1144] Does anybody care? Can you hear him crying?
[time=1153] In the shadow of this people, someone's crying.
[time=1166] Rachel talks about the needs. In a distant land, he says folks are dying over there.
[time=1176] We need to lend a hand.
[time=1181] It's getting late, let's pass the play. Just do the best you can.
[time=1187] Then the congregation rises for their final amen.
[time=1197] While in the shadow of this people, someone's crying.
[time=1206] Does anybody care? Can't you hear him crying?
[time=1215] In the shadow of this people, someone's crying.
[time=1228] The cold blue steel he clutches fast as he points it to the place where the shadow of this people
[time=1238] is resting on his face. He fills the sting, the church bells ring as he stumbles and goes down.
[time=1250] But folks just shake their head as they walk away from the figure on the ground.
[time=1260] And in the shadow of this people, someone's dying.
[time=1270] Nobody cared, nobody heard him crying.
[time=1278] In the shadow of this people, someone's crying.
[time=1295] Does anybody care? Can't you hear them crying?
[time=1302] Souls are out there dying.
[time=1308] We need to listen for their crying.
[time=1315] We need to reach out to the people, out there underneath our steeple.
[time=1323] Don't let the shadow of your steeple.
[time=1329] Find someone crying.
[time=1344] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1351] I wonder if that could be truly said of us, even at Black Hawk Baptist Church,
[time=1358] from the shadow of our church, the ministry of our church, there are people who may be crying out for help, people who are dying, spiritually separated from God,
[time=1368] and we are so preoccupied that we don't listen, we don't reach out.
[time=1372] What about within the shadow of your own life?
[time=1375] Are there people that need to hear the message of Christ are wanting answers in their life,
[time=1381] and yet we're too focused on other things that we don't pay attention, we don't hear, we don't respond?
[time=1390] It's a good reminder in that song. Let's pray.
[time=1393] Father, we know that there are people around us who have need.
[time=1400] You know, there are people who are spiritually dead.
[time=1406] God, there are many people who understand their condition crying out for help.
[time=1411] May we as a church be sensitive to the needs of others.
[time=1415] May we not be so focused on our own problems that we don't see the problems of others.
[time=1422] May we be like Christ, each one of us, in reaching out and helping those who are in need, sharing the gospel.
[time=1431] We know that pleases you in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[time=1438] I'd like to spend some time talking this morning about anticipation.
[time=1443] And just that topic leads me to at least comment on Dr. Browning's prediction of an earthquake today.
[time=1453] Because I figure that if God and I timed this just right, we could get a huge response come the invitation.
[time=1462] We'll see. We'll see. Hopefully not.
[time=1466] You know, we are coming into a season that I love.
[time=1471] I love the Christmas season, and I know that it is so commercialized today.
[time=1476] I mean, I was in a store before Halloween and already Christmas decorations were going up.
[time=1481] That's a little too much for me. But I just tried to look the other way and not see all that and try to save it until I'm ready.
[time=1488] But I enjoy the Christmas season. When Brian sings "O Holy Night," I just love that.
[time=1494] And a lot of the reason that I enjoy the season is because of the memories of my own childhood.
[time=1502] I have good fond memories of Christmas, and I want my children to enjoy the same things.
[time=1508] In fact, I want them to enjoy Christmas so much that even a couple times this past summer, I get them, I say, "Okay kids, get your sleeping bags, come in the living room." We put up a couple of lights in the living room, turn on the Christmas music, and we camp out in the living room listening to Christmas music as we go to sleep.
[time=1524] I just enjoy the season.
[time=1527] When I was a child, I learned to really anticipate Christmas.
[time=1534] I grew up in Florida. We didn't have too many white Christmases down there.
[time=1539] In fact, the only time I remember it even snowing in Florida was when I was in first grade, and it was such a big deal that everybody started saying, "It's snowing, it's snowing." We all got dismissed from our classes to go outside and see snow.
[time=1552] Of course, it was just these teeny little flakes, and if it got within three feet of your body heat, you know, it melted, so it was no big deal.
[time=1559] But there are people in Florida who have never seen snow, so we ran out to see it.
[time=1563] I was fortunate because I had grandparents that lived up north, and especially my grandparents in Toledo, Ohio, we would most Christmases travel into Toledo to spend Christmas with them,
[time=1576] and I loved it.
[time=1578] I still remember my parents packing up the car, and they packed the backseat with suitcases and things, laying out just right so my sister and I could just have a flat bed and playing back there as we drove up north.
[time=1592] And we'd usually leave some time in the night, and we'd get in the car and we'd begin our trip, and I just enjoyed laying in that backseat and listening to the Christmas carols being played on the radio as we traveled and falling asleep to those knowing that when I woke up in the morning, very likely I'd be able to look out the car window and see that white stuff on the ground, and it was such a thrill.
[time=1615] We'd get to Grandma's house and we'd spend those few days, and just being in a home that had a real basement and had a big attic, had two floors, I mean that was just so neat.
[time=1624] The smells of a grandma's house, you know what I'm talking about, had that special, even smell and feel about it, and we just enjoyed, but the greatest thing of all was come Christmas Eve Day and that night.
[time=1637] The anticipation of Christmas Eve.
[time=1642] Now let me just stop and share with those few of you that do it wrong.
[time=1647] All right?
[time=1650] The proper way to do Christmas is you open gifts Christmas morning, not Christmas Eve, if you do it Christmas Eve, I can only feel for your kids.
[time=1657] They miss everything that I'm going to describe to you right now, because on Christmas Eve there was just that thrill and anticipation of what was going to be happening the next morning.
[time=1666] And I remember I would walk up the steps of Grandma's house, up to the second floor where I had sleep, and there was a little landing that you'd turn on before you walked the rest of the way, and I'd stop on that landing and look back through the archway into the living room, and I'd see the Christmas tree with the gifts underneath.
[time=1681] Now every year, every year, my parents would try to tell us, these are all the gifts you're getting, but I knew better.
[time=1689] You know, as I grew up, I knew that when I woke up in the morning, those presents on the tree were going to be three times as many as I saw as I went up the step.
[time=1697] So I'd turn, I'd take one last look at the gifts and I'd go on up.
[time=1700] I slept in a room with my two uncles, they were twins, but they were only about five years older than I was.
[time=1706] So when I was young, they were still into the same excitement of Christmas time, and they enjoyed it too, and we got there and we'd talk about, oh, how great it was going to be Christmas morning, about the things we thought that we might be getting for Christmas, and we'd stay up late trying to get to sleep, but we couldn't get to sleep, and we'd just stay up, and finally, out of a sense of just exhaustion, we'd finally fall asleep, and you wake up in the morning, and you're so excited, and you go in and shake the bed, we're mom and dad, it's morning, it's time to get up, and they'd mumble something about it being 3 a.m., go back to bed, you know?
[time=1736] And so you go back and you just wait until light begins to appear, and then you know it's time, you go and you wake them up and walking down the steps, and seeing the tree just piled with gifts.
[time=1749] And we'd go in and we'd eat breakfast, we'd get together as a family, and we'd read this Christmas story from Luke chapter two, we'd share a little bit, then we'd get into the gifts.
[time=1761] That anticipation of Christmas Eve, you know, I want my kids to enjoy the same kind of thing, and that's great, I have the best memories of my Christmas times.
[time=1773] In Scripture, there was a man who also had anticipation, and I think was something like this.
[time=1781] It was an eager expectation of something that was going to take place.
[time=1785] It was a different Christmas season, it was the first Christmas season, and actually it was maybe about 40 days following the birth of Jesus Christ.
[time=1795] The man's name is Simeon, and we find his story in Luke chapter two, if you have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn there.
[time=1801] Luke chapter two tells us about this man's Simeon, we don't know that much about him, in fact all we know is what is written right here.
[time=1809] Luke chapter two, beginning with verse 25, and I'm just going to read two verses this morning, like you to follow along, and then we'll pick out some of the things that we can learn about this man and who he was, what kind of character he had.
[time=1825] He came with verse 25, now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon who was righteous and devout. He was waiting, he was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ. Now what are some of the things that we learn about Simeon?
[time=1849] If you allow me, I'm going to start from the end of those two verses and work backwards just point some of the things, point out some of the things that the Scripture tells us.
[time=1857] We know first of all that Simeon would not die before he had seen the Christ, before he had seen the Messiah.
[time=1865] Now isn't it funny, the misconceptions that we get about Christmas, because we sing certain Christmas songs, we see certain pictures, and they just become embedded in our mind, and we begin to think they're true.
[time=1877] We see the picture of wise men standing in a manger, worshiping Jesus, and we think, well that's the way it happened.
[time=1885] When we read Scripture, we see that by this time Christ was a small child and they lived in a house. We see the picture of Mary riding to Bethlehem on a donkey, and so we think that must be what happened, but Scripture never tells us. It tells us comparatively very little to what we begin to imagine what it must have been like, and when it comes to the character of Simeon, most often we think that this must have been an elderly man who was just about to die, and he was just waiting to see the Messiah. That may be true, but we don't know. Tradition tells us that Simeon was 113 years old, but that's just tradition. All we know about him is what it tells us here, and one thing we do know is that it was promised by God that he would not die until he saw the Messiah that had been promised for so long.
[time=1929] Since the time of creation in the fall, since the promise given to Abraham through the patriarchs, through the history of Israel, the promise, the prophets telling about this Messiah who had come, and Simeon was promised that he wouldn't die until he saw the Messiah. We also see that the Holy Spirit was upon him. The same thing is said of Mary in Luke chapter 1 verse 35.
[time=1953] The angel came to Mary and said, "You're going to have a child." Mary was bewildered. She said, "How can that be? I'm a virgin." The angel said, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and you'll conceive." When the Holy Spirit comes upon someone, it usually means something significant. It means something that's special. It's something that's unique, especially in the Old Testament. The Holy Spirit coming on someone meant that there was a unique enabling that was taking place. For Mary, that enabling was a virgin was able to conceive. For Simeon, the enabling was that he had a special knowledge. He had a special awareness. The promise given that he would see the Messiah. And as you read on in the story, you see that the same Holy Spirit leads him to the temple when Jesus is going to be there. And the same Holy Spirit empowers him to prophesy concerning this Christ and concerning his mother.
[time=2005] That was his enabling. The Holy Spirit was upon him.
[time=2009] The passage it also says, "He was waiting for the consolation of Israel to come." He was waiting. This is the anticipation.
[time=2017] There was an eagerness about it. Traditional prayer among the Jewish people.
[time=2021] May I see the consolation of Israel.
[time=2025] What they meant by that was, may I see the one who will bring peace. The one who will bring consolation. The one who will bring comfort to Jerusalem. Simeon waited for that. He was eager for it. During Simeon's day, there were various views about who or what the Messiah would be.
[time=2045] Some Jews felt that the Messiah was a literal person, a literal figure, perhaps a great religious leader, perhaps a military hero that was going to come lead them to victory and bring peace to the nation.
[time=2057] There were others that thought that it really wasn't even a person at all, but the Messiah was speaking in some sort of spiritual sense that God was going to fulfill this promise. There were all different kinds of views, but Simeon was one of those who believed that the Messiah was a person and was waiting for him to come.
[time=2077] He wasn't the only one. You read later in the chapter, you see this prophetess called Anna, who also was waiting. It was joyful when she knew that the Messiah had come. But Simeon was waiting for the consolation of Israel. And then it tells us that he was righteous and devout.
[time=2097] Some word studies lead us to believe that these two words righteous and devout actually refer to different aspects of Simeon's faith. When it describes him as being righteous, it's talking about his outward condition, that he followed and conformed to the law of God, that he lived in obedience to it. When it talks about him being devout, it's talking about his inward condition, that he feared God that he had a reverence for God. And you know, this devotion and righteousness are things that go together. You don't have one without the other.
[time=2129] True devotion results in righteous living.
[time=2133] And true righteousness springs out of a devoted heart.
[time=2137] If you try to have righteousness to live righteously, but you don't have a heart of devotion towards God, it just results in legalism.
[time=2145] You're trying to do all the right stuff, but you're doing it for the wrong reason, the wrong motivation.
[time=2150] If on the other hand, you try to nurture that sense of devotion in your heart, maybe that feeling of devotion in your heart, but it doesn't result in the works of righteousness in your life, and you've got dead religion. You've got faith without works. If you have one really, you will have the other.
[time=2170] Devotion, true devotion results in righteousness and righteous springs out of true devotion. And Simeon had them in his life.
[time=2178] I believe that the expectation of the coming Messiah helped Simeon keep his life in order.
[time=2186] He knew the Messiah was coming, and it resulted in life of devotion, result in life of righteousness.
[time=2194] This past summer, my wife and my kids took off from Michigan for a week.
[time=2198] They went up there to visit friends. They had a camp there for a week with people. And I was, stayed in Fort Wayne to work and go on a trip with our students.
[time=2210] During the week that they were gone, I would have been embarrassed if you came and visited our home. If you popped in and surprised me.
[time=2218] Because frankly, I didn't think any, you know, I didn't expect them coming back, and if dishes got dirty, they could pile in the sink.
[time=2226] I probably wasn't going to use them. Again, I just get another one out.
[time=2230] If I got up in the morning, the bed wasn't made. Who cares? I can sleep in a messy bed at night.
[time=2234] And it didn't matter to me. The clothes that I wore during the day, I just put them piles somewhere. Didn't bother me at all. If the living room got a little bit of disrepair, that's fine. And I lived that way most of the week until the time came when I knew my wife was returning. That made a difference.
[time=2250] The expectation of Connie coming back, you know, I left, I went home, left work, went home, and just started cleaning things up, washed dishes. I got that vacuum cleaner going through.
[time=2262] So I made the bed change the sheets. I put the dirty clothes where they're supposed to be.
[time=2266] Maybe even wash some. I don't know. I generally clean things up, put the house in order because I expected Connie to come back. And I wanted things to be right when she showed up. I think Simmons was doing the same thing.
[time=2278] He was putting his life in order because he was expecting. He was anticipating the coming of this Messiah. And it resulted in a life of devotion and righteousness to God.
[time=2290] Now what are some of the things that we can learn from Simmons life? What are some of the ways that we can apply his life to our own situation? How should we be like Simmons?
[time=2306] Well in this Christmas season we ought to be like Simmons and that we anticipate the coming of Christ.
[time=2314] I'm not talking just about celebrating Christmas. I'm talking about the coming of Christ as he's promised. He is going to return.
[time=2322] And we need to be people who anticipate that coming.
[time=2326] Philippians chapter 3 verse 20 says our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=2330] And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2334] Folks, this isn't where we belong.
[time=2338] Now we know that and we state that, but we live as though everything was involved in this life. We want to make sure that we have security in this life. We invest to make sure everything is right in this life that we can have comfort in this life. When difficulties come in this life, when persecutions, pains, sufferings come in this life, sometimes everything gets blown out of proportion because we think we don't deserve this.
[time=2362] We don't belong here. Our citizenship is in heaven the Scripture says. And if that's true and we know that's true then we should eagerly await. We should anticipate the coming of Christ to take us there. That's what Simeon Simeon anticipated the coming of Christ. So ought we to anticipate His coming again. We need to avoid getting into the same difficulty and problem that the people of Simeon's Day got into when it came to the prophecy of Christ coming, the Messiah coming. The people, the religious leaders of Simeon's Day thought they had it all figured out. They didn't all agree, but each of them thought that they had it figured out how this Messiah was going to come. In fact, they were so convinced that when Jesus actually did come, nobody thought it was Him. Nobody thought He could be the Messiah. Well, you don't fit our predictions. You don't fit our charts, you know?
[time=2418] It's not working the way we thought it would work. What good can come out of Nazareth?
[time=2422] Jesus was not recognized as the Messiah and we need to be careful that we don't fall in the same trap.
[time=2430] I think it was Kerry Grant who tells the story of one day walking down the road and he was recognized by a fan who came up to him and said "Hey, hey, don't I know you? Yeah, I know who you are." Just a minute.
[time=2442] Just a minute. As he sat there, trying to think of who Kerry Grant was Mr. Grant thought he'd help him out. And he said, "Kerry Grant." The man said, "No, no, no, that's not it. Just a minute. I'll get it. I'll get it." And despite him telling it, the man wouldn't believe in that. You know, Jesus came on the scene and as his ministry unfolded, he showed himself as who he was. He told the people who he was. They wouldn't believe.
[time=2466] They had it figured out, but they were wrong. We need to be careful we don't fall in that same trap. Now listen to this. The purpose of prophecy is not to predict. The purpose of prophecy is not to predict.
[time=2482] I'm not saying there's anything wrong with predicting, but that's not the purpose of prophecy. And sometimes, frankly, it bothers me a little bit to be able to go into a bookstore and pull out some versions of the Bible that have 14 fold out maps that give you all the charts and dates of when everything's going to happen in the future. Well, it's good if we study the Word and we come up with ideas of how things might be. I mean, I think that's why prophecy is given to us in one way so that we can, and our curiosity can go to God's Word and find out some truth, but the purpose is not to predict, to not try to set up dates, to know the time and the day, the hour when Christ is going to return. That's not the purpose of prophecy. And yet it happens over and over again. You've heard the stories.
[time=2526] Let me just read one. This came out of a national news release. It was in paper a few years ago. This is part of the article that appeared Sunday in the paper. Here's how it read.
[time=2538] Bill Moppen has no plans for Monday.
[time=2542] He says he'll be lifted into heaven by then. Moppen is the leader of a group of 40 to 50 people who believe the Bible forecasts that their ascension will take place sometime Sunday or before noon on Monday.
[time=2554] "There isn't any chance it won't happen," says the intense 51-year-old man. We're going. That's Sunday.
[time=2562] Here's Tuesday's article. Members of the Tucson Church were trying to figure out Monday just why their ascension into heaven off is predicted. Some were so sure of it that they'd quit their jobs, sold their houses, and otherwise tidied up their earthly affairs. They had calculated the date of their ascension known as the rapture by interpreting dates and signs related to the Bible, but the rapture fizzled.
[time=2586] On Sunday, Moppen answered the same question over and over. "We're going, we're going probably towards evening sometime, but his evening grew close and his midnight grew close, his responses grew vague." Well, it could be off 12 hours one way or the other, he said. Shortly after midnight, Moppen suggested that the rapture might take place sometime Monday, it didn't. Well, this is just one example. Many, many times this sort of thing has happened. And I think it's just an example of how our focus is wrong when it comes to prophecy. Again, the purpose of prophecy is not to predict.
[time=2622] The purpose of prophecy is so that we will prepare.
[time=2626] So that we will prepare so that we will be ready when Christ does come back. First John chapter 3, we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And then what does it say? And as it continues, it says, "Whoever has this hope purifies himself." Whoever has this hope, this expectation, this anticipation of Christ coming purifies himself.
[time=2654] When I was growing up, my father would often be gone on trips. He was an evangelist. So sometimes he'd be gone for a week or two, sometimes even three. We always look forward to Dad coming home again. We'd go to the airport and wait as the plane would come and be watching.
[time=2674] His dad would come off the plane and be eager to greet him. But one thing Dad was always sure to ask, usually after we'd gotten the car and began our drive home, he was always sure to ask, "Well, how are the kids while I was gone?" You know what I always wanted my mom to be able to give a good report about me?
[time=2694] I want her to give a good report for one thing. I feared the consequences of what it would be otherwise. But also because I loved my dad and I was looking forward to seeing him and I didn't want it to be spoiled, but my mom's saying, "Well, me wasn't so good. You know why you're gone?" I wanted her to be able to give a good report. That should be what happens as a result of our expecting or anticipating Christ.
[time=2718] We should be purifying ourself. We anticipate His coming. We long for His coming again. And when He comes, we want to be able to give a good report. And so we purify ourselves. That's what Simeon did. That's how we ought to respond. How would it read if your name were put in Scripture? And we put it into contemporary setting.
[time=2738] What would it say in Luke chapter 2 about you? Could the same things be said? Could it be said, "Now there was a woman in Fort Wayne called Sarah who was righteous and devout.
[time=2750] She was waiting for the consolation of the church to come." Could it be said?
[time=2754] Could it be said, "Now there was a man in Fort Wayne called Frank who was righteous and devout.
[time=2762] He was waiting for the consolation of the church to come." Can you put your name in there? Can it be said of you? "Now there was a person named righteous and devout, waiting for Christ to come." Is it true? Is it true of us?
[time=2782] Are you waiting for that to happen?
[time=2786] Do you really anticipate it?
[time=2790] There are some who don't believe. It says in 2 Peter said, "Oh, where's this promise of his coming?" I mean since the days of Noah things have been the same and nothing's going to change, nothing's going to happen where is this promise? You're a fool to believe that.
[time=2810] Yet it goes on to say that God is patient with him a day is like a thousand years and he is going to return. Do you believe that?
[time=2818] Are you waiting? Are we like sin and are we righteous and devout and are living, anticipating that Christ is going to come again?
[time=2826] And if somehow I should die before Christ comes I will still be standing before Him face to face and I look forward to that.
[time=2834] In fact, that's where my citizenship is. That's where my real home is and I can understand the emotion I feel about relationships here and that's real. There's a sorrow in thinking about even leaving that.
[time=2846] We can't even measure the joy of what it's going to be like to be with Christ in heaven. My wife often gets bothered by the fact that we talk about heaven. I said, "You know, Connie, when we're in heaven, we're not going to be married like we're here on earth." And she just thinks that's so sad. Must be because I'm just such a good husband. I don't know but she thinks we ought to have, but I said, Connie, you know, what we enjoy as far as marriage, the best we could possibly have for marriage. When we get to heaven, it's going to be millions of times better.
[time=2878] We can't even imagine. We're not going to miss this. We'll look back on this and say, "This was just a shadow of the reality." And that's what it's going to be like to be with Christ. Do you anticipate that?
[time=2890] Are you eager for His coming or do you get preoccupied with other things? Perhaps you're here this morning and you don't even believe that that's necessarily true. It doesn't change the truth.
[time=2898] Are we waiting? Do we anticipate?
[time=2902] There'd been an accident.
[time=2906] It was the middle of the night, about two dozen miles from anywhere.
[time=2912] Two cars set crumpled like candy wrappers alongside of the road.
[time=2917] Five people lay in the highway with various injuries.
[time=2921] They were all alive, but they all needed an ambulance.
[time=2926] Fortunately, about 100 yards down the road, there was a payphone.
[time=2932] One man, the youngest of the group, limped painfully down the road towards that payphone
[time=2938] and placed a call to the nearest town, and then he limped back to wait with the others.
[time=2946] "It's okay," he told him.
[time=2949] I talked to the ambulance driver and he said he's going to get out to us very soon.
[time=2955] They all waited. They listened to the sound of the ambulance, but all they heard was sounds of their own breathing and occasionally a cricket sounding off in the distance.
[time=2966] Finally, from across the road, a large man in a business suit spoke up.
[time=2972] "How do you know he's coming?" I said, "I don't care what that ambulance driver said. I don't think he's going to get here at all.
[time=2980] I can't wait forever, you know. I'm going to take care of myself. I'm going to go get help myself."
[time=2986] Despite the young man's objections, the businessman dragged himself to his feet and staggered off down the road.
[time=2992] The young man called out and said, "Sir, sir, you're going the wrong way.
[time=2995] There's not even a town in that direction." The businessman, not listening, staggered off down the road in the opposite way from the phone booth.
[time=3005] Nearby of the remaining four, there were two brothers.
[time=3009] They had identical white beards, had a perpetual scowl on their face.
[time=3015] They leaned back to back against speed limit side alongside of the highway.
[time=3021] The first of the brothers said, "Tell me, young man, exactly what did that ambulance driver say?"
[time=3029] "Yes," said the other. "We need to know his exact words." Well, the young man went on to explain that the ambulance driver said that they needed to stay on the road
[time=3038] and to keep alert, to make sure they don't doze off, and that he was about 31 miles away and would be there as soon as he could. That's all.
[time=3048] The first brother took out his pocket calculator and began to figure punching the buttons.
[time=3052] Let's see, 31 miles, average speed, 55. I figure he'll arrive in exactly 34 minutes and 24 seconds.
[time=3062] Well, the second brother had his own calculator and he got it out and began punching his own buttons and said, "Oh, you're wrong as usual. It's going to take 33 minutes, 48 seconds."
[time=3072] Nonsense, said the first year not allowing for the extra 100 yards between the phone booth at our present location.
[time=3078] So he began arguing about whose prediction was right when the ambulance driver would be there.
[time=3082] They were arguing there was a woman who had been thrown from the accident.
[time=3085] She was laying over by the bushes and she listened to the brothers speaking. She started to get worried.
[time=3089] "Oh my, oh my," she thought. 33 or 34 minutes. How am I ever going to amend this dress?
[time=3095] I need to get ready before that ambulance driver gets here and struggling even with the broken wrist.
[time=3101] She fumbled through a purse and took out a sewing kit and began trying to repair her dress, mumbling.
[time=3106] I've got so much to do. I hope he doesn't get here too soon.
[time=3110] The two brothers still are arguing and discussing off in the background.
[time=3115] Finally one of them said, "I have it." The driver said, "Stay off the road." There's a hidden meaning there if you just pay attention to it close enough.
[time=3124] It means the ambulance isn't going to come along the road at all. It's going to come somewhere out there in the trees and the bushes.
[time=3129] The other brother said, "No, not the trees and the bushes. It's going to be out in the hills.
[time=3132] Come on, let's get off the road." And the brother stood up painfully trying to get shuffle off the road and into the bushes.
[time=3138] And the young man tried to keep them from leaving, but they just looked over their shoulders, shook their heads and said to him, "Son, you've not studied the driver's statement as we have. There are mysteries here you cannot comprehend."
[time=3151] Well, they wandered off on the night and the young man heard them arguing as they went about what was going to come first.
[time=3156] The sound of the siren or the flashing lights of the ambulance, and they left.
[time=3162] The woman couldn't be bothered with all she had to do, so the young man slumped against a tree and waited for the ambulance to come.
[time=3176] He waited. He was tired.
[time=3179] He started to doze off, but shook himself awake, saying, "No, I've got to watch. I've got to wait." He's coming.
[time=3187] The first pinks of dawn were appearing in the sky by the time they heard the siren and the young man smiled.
[time=3193] He was happy to hear it. But the woman cried.
[time=3197] Looking up from the dress, she was still mending. She's like, "No, no. He can't come yet. I've still got so much to do.
[time=3203] I've got to hide. He can come back and get me later, but he can't find me now. I've got to finish the dress." And she gathered up her sewing kit and stumbled awkwardly off the street and into the trees.
[time=3213] "Don't let him come for me," she pleaded. "I'm just not ready yet." And she disappeared in the woods, leaving the young man by himself.
[time=3221] The ambulance came, lights flashing, screeching to a halt in front of the man and the driver stepped out and looked around and said, "Where are the others?"
[time=3230] Oh, they left. They didn't believe or they weren't ready or they got preoccupied with other things.
[time=3239] The driver shook his head as if to understand, went over and helped the young man up and helped him into the back of the ambulance.
[time=3246] When the young man got in, he fell back on the cot and heaved a sigh of thankful relief.
[time=3253] And he looked around, somewhat puzzled.
[time=3258] You know, he said, "The ambulance really isn't very big. I mean, excuse me for saying so, but I don't think you'd get a whole lot of people in here."
[time=3270] That's true, the driver replied.
[time=3273] But then again, there weren't a whole lot of people waiting for me, weren't there?
[time=3279] Are you waiting? When Christ came the first time, there weren't a whole lot of people waiting for him.
[time=3288] They had excuses. Some just didn't believe.
[time=3292] Others were headed all figured out the wrong way. Others were too preoccupied with other things.
[time=3297] It couldn't be time for the Messiah to come yet.
[time=3300] They're caught off guard.
[time=3303] When Christ comes again, how will he find you? How will he find me?
[time=3310] Will he find us believing?
[time=3313] Will he find us ready knowing that we're in a state of disrepair and a state of need, but he's coming to take us home?
[time=3322] If he came today, would he find us ready?
[time=3327] We need to be people like Simeon.
[time=3331] It had been revealed to Simeon in a supernatural way that he would be alive when the Messiah came.
[time=3337] I don't have that revelation given to me.
[time=3340] But you know what, the Holy Spirit, God has told us in His Word that Christ is coming back.
[time=3346] We may be tempted like the people that Peter writes about to say, "Oh, things aren't changing."
[time=3353] Or we may be tempted on the other hand to look at things in the Middle East and become so preoccupied with what's happening and say,
[time=3359] "Well, this is it." And we get out our charts and we begin figuring all out.
[time=3363] And we decide by February 13th next year Christ is going to be here.
[time=3370] We get our focus all wrong.
[time=3373] Instead, we need to look at around us and see, you know what, these are some of the things the Bible does talk about.
[time=3377] I may not know how it all fits together.
[time=3379] But the promise of God is sure it's going to happen.
[time=3382] And the prediction of Christ coming simply means that I need to make sure I'm prepared.
[time=3386] I need to make sure that when He comes, He doesn't catch me off guard.
[time=3390] He doesn't catch me focused on other things.
[time=3393] He finds me watching.
[time=3395] He finds me with a pure heart and a pure life.
[time=3401] He finds me like Simeon.
[time=3403] Righteous and about.
[time=3407] I hope that in this Christmas season you enjoy the anticipation of the event.
[time=3413] Of the getting together, of the family, of the friends, of the gift giving, of the gift receiving.
[time=3420] But more than that, I hope you realize the anticipation that this Messiah who came once as a baby is coming again is Lord and King.
[time=3431] I hope as you anticipate Him that you're ready.

[time=3468] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3471] Our Father, we thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3478] Though He was born a baby, we knew that He grew up and became our Savior, died on the cross for our sins.
[time=3485] Today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3489] I ask You to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3494] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3498] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
