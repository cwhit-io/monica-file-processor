[time=146] (bells chiming) [MUSIC - 262 seconds]
[time=428] (audience applauding) - Thank you, teenagers and Tim.
[time=450] What amazes me and excites me, I guess, is the thing that last night I saw cheerleaders cheering away for the team.
[time=458] I saw ball players and then I saw kids in the stands over the railing cheering for their teams last night and it's just great to see them involved in so many activities and then to be here this morning and singing for us.
[time=471] Fact last night was a very special night in the life of Black Hawk Christian School and their team.
[time=477] Josh rang, Josh is over here, raise your hand, Josh.
[time=480] There he is, there he is.
[time=482] Josh scored his 1,000th point in his career and last week was the WPTA Channel 21 TV Area Player of the Week and not only that does Josh play well but he's so involved in the servant teams in our youth program and is so willing.
[time=501] We like the combination and we love to see it where a young man loves the Lord and yet is a fine ball player and represents us well on the basketball court.
[time=509] Thanks, Josh, let's give him a hand.
[time=511] (audience applauding) - We're emphasizing the song of the Angels today.
[time=521] Let's sing 131, please, singing verses one, two, and four
[time=527] of 131.
[time=529] (gentle music)
[time=546] [MUSIC - 73 seconds]
[time=624] - And we continue to worship Christ, the newborn king, as we listen to read the favor, as he ministers to us in song.
[time=633] Speaking of Bethlehem morning.
[time=636] (gentle music)
[time=643] [MUSIC - 273 seconds]

[time=1023] Well, this is always the time of the year that's very special for families.
[time=1028] I know that the airports and the bus stations and train stations are gonna be very busy in the coming days with eager and excited people heading home for Christmas.
[time=1038] And my family is no exception.
[time=1039] They are already home with us and we're just delighted to have them and I wanna introduce them to our television audience today.
[time=1046] First of all, Carol, Carol, it's just great to be working with you in the church.
[time=1050] You've been a really big help in the recent days, especially when we've had extra responsibilities and I wanna thank you for all the good work that you've done in the past months.
[time=1062] It's really been fun this year to work with the children.
[time=1065] We have King's Kids, which is grades one through three.
[time=1068] And I work with Jennifer and Lisa and we just really enjoy the children.
[time=1072] That's my favorite part of the whole church.
[time=1075] Well, you've been not only busy with the kids, Carol, but you, while we've been getting the music ready for the living Christmas tree, you have been working with all the decorations.
[time=1084] And as the people see the tree, they'll see a lot of the work that you did in preparing all the decorations for the tree.
[time=1090] And I wanna thank you for that.
[time=1092] - Thanks, Pete.
[time=1093] We did have a lot of help this year.
[time=1095] We have about 51 ladies that come and help me for about seven days and we work and we wrapped packages this year and we decorate the tree.
[time=1104] It's not like decorating the house.
[time=1105] There's a, the church is a large building.
[time=1108] Takes us a long time.
[time=1110] - We also had kids that participated in the living Christmas tree and you helped out with them, they were so cute.
[time=1115] And just, that was a very special time of the living Christmas tree this year.
[time=1120] Thanks for that.
[time=1121] Lisa and Scott are Lisa's and my oldest daughter, Mary, to Scott Qualls.
[time=1126] They're here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1127] Lisa, tell us what's been occupying your time in recent days.
[time=1131] - Well, I've been busy at my job at Orthodontic Specialty Services and I also help out with the kids choir, the King's Kids.
[time=1138] I sing in the living Christmas tree along with Scott.
[time=1141] And we're just looking forward to a wonderful time at Christmas with our family.
[time=1144] - That's great.
[time=1145] Thanks, Lisa.
[time=1146] We're glad that you're here.
[time=1147] Scott, you've been very busy and preparing for the ministry and seminary.
[time=1152] And I'm just thankful that we had the opportunity to hear you preach a couple of weeks ago.
[time=1158] How long do you have before you'll receive your degree?
[time=1161] - Well, Pete, I have another two semesters to go before I get my master of divinity.
[time=1165] I'm also working part time for a Christian contractor in the church.
[time=1169] So that takes up a little bit of my time.
[time=1171] I'm also trying to stay out of Saudi Arabia as I'm in the Indiana National Guard.
[time=1175] But we're always ready to go if we need to.
[time=1178] - Well, thanks, Scott.
[time=1179] We are just delighted that Scott is preparing for the ministry and we just trust that the Lord will allow him to finish his schooling as about a year to go.
[time=1187] And then God will call him to a church.
[time=1189] And we're just delighted with that.
[time=1191] And glad that he's involved, not only in training for the ministry, but also involved here at Black Hawk singing in the choir and teaching Sunday school classes and even preaching occasionally.
[time=1202] And that's great.
[time=1203] Peter, you just came home a couple of days ago.
[time=1205] Peter, is it college?
[time=1207] Tell us how things have gone this fall for you, Peter.
[time=1210] - I'm well so far, they're going pretty good.
[time=1212] I will be graduating in May and with a marketing degree.
[time=1217] - And you go to what school, Peter?
[time=1219] - Liberty University.
[time=1220] - Liberty University is located in?
[time=1222] - Lynchburg, Virginia.
[time=1224] - Peter has been at Lynchburg for four years now and we've had the opportunity to go down there and see him, it's been great to have him there at that Christian school and preparing for his life's work.
[time=1236] Finally, our youngest child is Andy.
[time=1238] Andy is here home with us and is still in high school.
[time=1242] Andy, what are some of the activities you have?
[time=1245] - Well, I've been active in sports at Black Hawk Christian with a soccer basketball and I enjoy being a student leader and servant team, part of Turpoint Youth Ministries.
[time=1255] - Great.
[time=1256] Well, one of the greatest delights for any dad is to have all of his family involved in Christian work and serving the Lord and loving him and we want to encourage you in your own homes that you'll keep Christ the center of your home and that you will pray for your children and work with them that they will honor the Lord as they grow up and they've established their own homes.
[time=1277] It's a delight to be with you today.
[time=1278] I hope that you'll stay with us for the remainder of the Bible hour and that God will bless you in a special way because of this telecast.
[time=1286] Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and a Christ filled 1991.
[time=1291] [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=1389] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=1394] Father, sometimes when we come to worship the Lord and we hear the music, we long to be in Your presence.
[time=1399] And we're thankful that you've given us this avenue to praise your name and how thankful
[time=1405] we've been for the people that have been faithful in singing in the tree and giving the message that indeed Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, was born.
[time=1414] We thank you for our congregation.
[time=1415] We're so grateful that they're here together, anxious to worship you, to open their hearts and minds, to be instructed to better live for Jesus Christ.
[time=1426] There's excitement, too, as young people, collegians, come home to be with their families and others, families will be coming together together in this holiday season.
[time=1435] And in the midst of this excitement, Lord, there are some sorrow and some homes.
[time=1439] I'm so real times of trial.
[time=1442] We pray that you'll be with Gary Layman and his family and the loss of his father, that you'll strengthen them and just give them encouragement during this time.
[time=1451] I pray for Vic Moats and the loss of his wife this week, you'll strengthen him and give
[time=1458] him the confidence that she's with the father and in a much better place, and yet that loss
[time=1464] is still there.
[time=1465] Lord, we continue to pray for Greg Handel, keep his body strong, and Jack Saylor, give
[time=1472] him strength.
[time=1474] We pray for Gary Woman's mother who was very ill in the hospital and pray that you'll just strengthen her body and restore her, if it be your will.
[time=1484] Pray for Todd and Lisa's mother who was ill, pray for Bob Ross' mother who was going in for exploratory surgery tomorrow.
[time=1493] And Lord, there are others that we are unaware of in our congregation that need your prayers.
[time=1498] We pray that you'll hear them right now and that you will answer according to your will and according to their need.
[time=1504] Thank you for this time to pray to you and to be confident that you are there and listening to every prayer that we have and answering according to your will.
[time=1513] Bless us as we continue this service, and we'll praise you in Jesus' precious name, amen.
[time=1539] To you I give all my service to you, no matter the cost or what others do, I give all my service
[time=1565] to you, I give all of my problems to you, I give all my problems to you, no matter the cost
[time=1588] or what others do, I give all my problems to you, I give all my family to you, I give all
[time=1609] of my family Lord to you, no matter the cost or what others do, I give my family to you,
[time=1638] and I give all of my future to you, I give all my future Lord to you, no matter the cost
[time=1656] or what others do, I give all my future to you, I give all my worship to you, I give all
[time=1684] my worship to you, no matter the cost or what others do, I give all my worship to you.
[time=1712] I give all my worship to you.
[time=1742] My heart is prepared to listen to the Word of God and to worship as we continue with
[time=1751] the message, appreciate the ministry of men who have come from across our area to minister to us at Blackhawk and give of that extra time to do that.
[time=1761] I met Harry Shields via Ken Nichols and then David Fetser last week when he spoke and they
[time=1768] assured me that this man ought to come to Blackhawk and speak.
[time=1771] I listened to him in the first service and received such a blessing that I hope too that your hearts are open right now, that you'll get your Bibles ready and you'll take in what he has because it will be in great encouragement for you.
[time=1785] Mr. Shields is a professor at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=1788] He's been there for six years, formerly he was in the pastorate and has a real pastor's heart.
[time=1794] You welcome Harry Shields as he comes to the pulpit right now.
[time=1803] Thank you very, very much and it is a great delight to be with you.
[time=1809] The year was 1985 and the Chicago Bears had just won the NFC Championship for the National
[time=1817] Football League.
[time=1819] It was the first time in a number of years that the Bears were going to be playing in a championship game and it was this year that they were headed for the Super Bowl.
[time=1828] During the 1985 season a number of things had happened in the entire process of that season.
[time=1834] A number of unknown football players had become national celebrities but there was one individual
[time=1840] that stood out.
[time=1842] You probably know him as I mentioned his name.
[time=1844] His name was Walter Payton.
[time=1846] That same season had also accomplished a phenomenal record as he had just become the top running
[time=1854] back in the history of the National Football League.
[time=1858] The Bears made their way to that Super Bowl.
[time=1862] Everyone thought that it would be Walter Payton's Super Bowl.
[time=1867] The Super Sunday came and everyone was focused on the Bears and especially Walter Payton.
[time=1874] The game started and the game ended but some unusual things transpired.
[time=1879] What was interesting is that Walter Payton never scored a single touchdown in the '85-86
[time=1887] Super Bowl.
[time=1889] There was one play you may remember, it was a goal line play in which it was almost certain that who was ever given the ball would dive over the line and score touchdown.
[time=1897] It was in that play that Coach Mike Dittkis sent in a defensive player, William the refrigerator
[time=1903] Perry and the handoff was not given to Payton but it was given to Perry and he burst through the line and he scored the touchdown.
[time=1913] The next day some reporters caught up with Walter Payton and they said what did you think
[time=1919] about yesterday's Super Bowl.
[time=1922] He said well it was okay, we won and I'm glad for that.
[time=1926] He said you know I've been looking forward to this game all of my life and he said after
[time=1932] it's over, well it seems just like another game.
[time=1938] The wonder and the excitement is gone.
[time=1941] Well that happens with Super Bowls and it happens with players who go into great games
[time=1947] but it happens in a lot of other areas of life as well.
[time=1950] It can happen that the wonder of life itself and even the wonder of this season of the year can disappear as fast as it is come.
[time=1960] I don't know what's happening in your world right now or in your home but I know that in a lot of homes throughout our country there are people who are making plans for Christmas.
[time=1970] They are inviting people and their family members who are coming and there are students and children who are home for the holidays and there's all kinds of excitement and wonder and as the gifts are prepared and the meals are placed on the table after time transpires
[time=1986] people look back and say what happened?
[time=1990] I was looking forward to this day and it's just another day on the calendar.
[time=1995] Some of the toys are already broken, people have gone home, I'm not so sure it was really
[time=2001] what it was cracked up to be.
[time=2004] Some of you feel that already even before the day has transpired.
[time=2010] Why does that happen?
[time=2011] Well I suppose we could give a lot of different answers.
[time=2014] It happens on some occasions because we are wrapped up in the events that surrounds us.
[time=2020] We are very busy and we do not take time to think about what the season is all about.
[time=2026] On other occasions we are self-reflected, focused inward on what's happening to us or what should happen to us and we never really take the time to think about what the season
[time=2036] is all about.
[time=2036] Well, there are a lot of other reasons as to why it happens but what could be done if
[time=2043] at all?
[time=2044] To restore the wonder to Christmas.
[time=2047] I would like to suggest to you there is an answer to that question and it's found for us in God's word.
[time=2054] In fact I invite you to turn there in your copy of the scriptures this morning to Colossians chapter 3.
[time=2060] We are going to set up camp for a few moments around verses 15 through 17 and I'm sure that
[time=2066] as some of you turn there you are probably saying that's not a very familiar Christmas text.
[time=2071] Probably saying why didn't he turn to some of the ancient prophets or to one of the gospel records about the birth of our Lord?
[time=2078] We could do that but I would like to suggest to you that this portion of scripture has a great deal to say to us about what Christmas should be all about and what the wonder of
[time=2090] Christmas should be all about as well.
[time=2093] If we are going to understand verses 15 through 17 of Colossians chapter 3 it's important that we understand some of the presuppositions of the author.
[time=2102] The Apostle Paul was writing to the Colossian church.
[time=2106] You may remember that it was the Colossian believers who had some distorted thinking about life and about Christianity.
[time=2113] More specifically they had some questions about the Lord Christ himself as to why he had entered into the world.
[time=2120] Some thought that he was just another man, another individual, a good teacher.
[time=2125] It was the Apostle Paul who wrote to the Colossians to remind them that he was no mere man.
[time=2130] He was the God man.
[time=2132] And the Apostle Paul goes on to point out to the Colossians that Jesus Christ entered into the world as the God man to take upon himself human flesh.
[time=2142] Paul also has the presupposition that he came into the world to take upon himself human flesh so that he might become our Redeemer.
[time=2152] So that through his death he might be a satisfaction to the wrath of God and satisfy God's righteous
[time=2159] requirements for atonement.
[time=2162] And that through his resurrection from the dead he would now be able to justify sinners
[time=2170] like those of us gathered here this morning and those of us watching by way of television.
[time=2175] Jesus Christ came with a purpose and he entered into history and time so that we might have
[time=2181] redemption.
[time=2183] Now Christmas exists, it is placed upon our human calendars so that we might focus upon his first coming primarily.
[time=2191] To remember that he came into history and time to redeem us.
[time=2196] That's the basic presupposition behind the Apostle Paul's writing.
[time=2201] It's in that context however that Paul begins to tell us that if those things are true and
[time=2207] they are then we need to think and then we need to act in a certain way.
[time=2212] And I'm suggesting to you if we begin to act and think the way the Apostle Paul instructs us to do so that the wonder of Christmas can be restored.
[time=2223] Not just another holiday, not just a busy event on the calendar but the true wonder can
[time=2229] come about.
[time=2230] Now how will that transpire?
[time=2232] I invite you to notice a couple of words that the Apostle Paul uses in this text.
[time=2239] At the end of verse 15 would you notice that he says and be thankful, three very concise
[time=2248] words that say a great deal.
[time=2251] You go on into verse 16 and would you notice that he says in about the middle of that verse
[time=2257] that we are to admonish one another with all wisdom.
[time=2260] And as you sing Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude or thankfulness in your
[time=2266] hearts to God.
[time=2268] And notice the end of verse 17 and he says whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him.
[time=2279] Did you notice how the word thankful appears?
[time=2284] That word thankful has the idea of worship and Paul is saying that if these things are
[time=2290] true about Jesus Christ that he's entered into history in time, then we are to think in a certain way and we are to act in a certain way and that way in which we are to act and think is to have behavior that has worship behind it.
[time=2305] I have no doubts that if the Apostle Paul were here this morning he would tell us that if we want to restore the wonder of Christmas, it is imperative that we make our worlds,
[time=2315] our corporate and our individual worlds, worlds of worship.
[time=2323] Now how is it that you're going to make your world and how is it that I'm going to make my world a world of worship?
[time=2331] Let's go back to the text because there's some good instruction here.
[time=2335] If you're going to make your world a world of worship, one of the first things that you need to do is to make sure that you make peace a priority.
[time=2343] I say that because of what Paul says in verse 15.
[time=2347] He says let the peace of Christ rule in your heart since as members of one body you were called to peace.
[time=2354] He's saying make sure that peace becomes a priority in all that you do.
[time=2359] Let's talk for a moment just what he means whenever he talks about the peace of Christ.
[time=2364] Whenever he says let the peace of Christ dwell within you, he's not necessarily talking about world peace in which the leaders of the world get together, they sign an armistice
[time=2374] and after that everything will be peaceful.
[time=2378] We know that treaties have been signed and treaties have been broken and war and the rumors of war continue.
[time=2386] Paul's talking about a different kind of peace.
[time=2389] When he talks about the peace of Christ he could be talking first of all about the peace that we have with Christ or through Christ, peace that we have with God.
[time=2399] You see prior to our redemption in a sense we were at war with God, we deserved his wrath.
[time=2407] But now when Christ enters into the world and when he went to the cross he's satisfied the righteous just wrath of the living God.
[time=2415] God was satisfied.
[time=2416] So now that we can have peace with him because of what Christ has done.
[time=2421] It could be what he's talking about when he talks about the peace of Christ.
[time=2424] There's another possibility.
[time=2426] The other possibility has to do with the fact that when he talks about the peace of Christ he's talking about what we sense in our mind and our conscience when we are obedient to
[time=2436] the will and the ways of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2438] It's the kind of thing whenever you come to the end of the day and you reflect upon the day and you say, "Well, I didn't break any walls," didn't really go over the speed limit
[time=2449] or at least not that much, or we say, "I didn't steal anything from the boss, didn't
[time=2455] lie to anyone, didn't cheat on my mate," in a sense there is peace of mind.
[time=2462] That also could be what the Apostle Paul is talking about.
[time=2465] Peace that comes because of our relationship with God through Jesus Christ and peace that comes about whenever we are in obedience to him.
[time=2474] That's the peace he's talking about and it's to be a priority in our lives.
[time=2477] Now would you notice what else he says in verse 15?
[time=2481] He says, "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts."
[time=2487] He's saying that we are to be so conscience of what we have with God through Jesus Christ
[time=2493] that that peace that he has given to us is to set up residence in our hearts.
[time=2497] It's to rule all that we do, not our emotions, not our anger, not our indifference, but the
[time=2503] peace of Christ is to rule within us.
[time=2507] He says that that is the logical thing to do.
[time=2510] Did you see the last line of verse 15?
[time=2513] He says, "Since as members of one body, you were called to peace."
[time=2519] He says, "As members of the body of Christ, since you have redemption through Jesus Christ, you're called to something, not just another vocation, you are called to be peacemakers
[time=2530] because the peace of Christ is dwelling within you and that peace comes from God himself.
[time=2536] Peace is to be a priority." Then you might say, "Shields, I'd like to do that, but you see, you don't know what goes on in my household.
[time=2546] You don't know the kind of conflict that I have with my mate.
[time=2549] You don't know what's happening in the lives of my children.
[time=2551] You don't know the kind of job that I go through." That's true, I don't know those things.
[time=2556] But this verse still stands and the peace of Christ is still to rule within us.
[time=2565] Last summer during the hurricane season, one of the national television networks decided that they were going to track the storms to alert people ahead of time before they ever hit the eastern coast.
[time=2575] It's all camera crew with one of the reporters got together and they boarded one of the national
[time=2581] weather service airplanes and they started to fly out over the Atlantic Ocean.
[time=2586] It wasn't very long until the plane started to rock a little bit and they were headed right into the midst of that hurricane storm.
[time=2594] But after flying for a few more moments, they came to the very center of the hurricane itself and it was amazing, darkness all about him, but the plane is no longer rocking.
[time=2604] There's a little bit of rain on the outside of the window of the airplane, but in the midst of all of the blackness and all of this tremendous energy swirling about them, there is silence, almost as if there is peace.
[time=2620] That's what the Apostle Paul has in mind.
[time=2623] Whatever we allow, whenever we choose to allow, the peace of Christ to dwell within us and
[time=2631] whenever it rules in our lives, you know what happens?
[time=2635] We begin to enjoy people and the wonder of Christmas returns.
[time=2642] You see my friend, to restore the wonder of Christmas, we need to make our worlds, worlds
[time=2649] of worship, our individual private worlds must become places whereby we are focusing up
[time=2655] on Christ, not upon ourselves, no matter what might be happening around about us and that will take place whenever we make peace a priority.
[time=2665] There's something else that we can do to begin to restore the wonder and the joy of Christmas.
[time=2672] That second thing is also found in verse 15.
[time=2676] See we can make our worlds, worlds of worship, whenever we begin to maintain an attitude
[time=2682] of gratitude.
[time=2684] Look at how the verse ends.
[time=2686] It says, "And be thankful." I would remind you once more that that word thankful comes from the vocabulary of the ancient world that relates to worship.
[time=2698] In the Old Testament had the idea of people coming and bringing the fruits of their labors and offering those up in thanksgiving to God.
[time=2705] It is a word of worship.
[time=2708] Would you notice also, however, that it is not a suggestion?
[time=2711] It's not a, now consider being thankful if you get everything that you want for the holidays.
[time=2717] Doesn't say that.
[time=2719] And it doesn't say be thankful if everything in your world is exactly the way you want it to be.
[time=2725] It doesn't say that either.
[time=2728] Rather it says, "And be thankful." It is an excitation.
[time=2733] And it is a command.
[time=2735] The writer is saying, "By an act of your will, choose to be thankful."
[time=2741] You see, if we depend upon our circumstances to be thankful, we will never express gratitude.
[time=2747] And the thankfulness is an act, a decision that we make whereby we say, "I'm going to offer up to God what he deserves.
[time=2754] I'm going to focus on him this holiday season because he deserves my praise and thanksgiving."
[time=2760] I have appreciated the writings and the messages of Mr. David Mains.
[time=2769] David Mains has radio broadcasts on a regular basis, and he takes his listeners every year
[time=2775] right before Easter through what he calls a 50-day spiritual adventure.
[time=2780] Some of you may have been a part of that.
[time=2783] And of course, at that spiritual adventure, he has the listeners do a number of things.
[time=2786] One of the things that I always appreciate is that he encourages individuals to go on a God hunt.
[time=2793] His assumption is that people do not necessarily look for the involvement of God in their lives.
[time=2798] And that's true.
[time=2799] We get so caught up in our worlds, we're looking at our calendars and our day timers in and out of every day, and we forget that God is in that day as well.
[time=2809] Mains suggests that we begin to look for God.
[time=2811] Has he answered any prayer today?
[time=2813] Jot it down.
[time=2815] Mains says, "Have you noticed that there has been some unexpected, wonderful event in your life that you did not anticipate?
[time=2822] Write it down." Any other evidences where you see God involved in your life or in the lives of your family members, write it down.
[time=2829] Do you know what happens when we do that?
[time=2832] The focus comes off of ourselves, and we begin to focus on the living Lord God.
[time=2840] And we become thankful.
[time=2843] My friend, that should happen especially during this holiday season of the year.
[time=2849] If somehow we are to escape the hustle and bustle and life and the destruction and the depression of the season of the year, if it's going to happen, we must restore the wonder of worship.
[time=2860] And that can happen whenever we make our lives day in and day out, lives of worship.
[time=2869] And it will happen whenever we make peace a priority and whenever we maintain an attitude
[time=2876] of gratitude.
[time=2877] Well, there's something else that we can do to begin to restore the wonder of Christmas.
[time=2885] We see it in verse 16.
[time=2888] What you notice that we restore the wonder of Christmas whenever we make our worlds, worlds of worship, and we begin to make God's Word our will and our way in life.
[time=2901] You see, how do you get that from the text shields?
[time=2903] Well, look at the first few words.
[time=2905] He says, "Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another
[time=2912] with all wisdom." Notice that he makes mention of the Word of Christ.
[time=2917] He could have also inserted the phrase, "Let the Word of God dwell in you richly." That's what he's talking about.
[time=2923] The Word of Christ is probably a reference to the gospel message that has come in and through Jesus Christ.
[time=2929] When he talks about the Word of Christ, he could also be talking about the Word of the Apostles, who after Christ ascended on high, the Apostles went about proclaiming how we
[time=2939] ought to live in view of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=2943] When he talks about the Word of Christ, he's talking about God's Word for us whereby we embrace it as our own personal will.
[time=2953] You'll notice that he says about the Word of Christ that it is to dwell within us.
[time=2959] That word dwell is a very significant term.
[time=2962] It has the idea of setting up residence within our lives.
[time=2966] Just as we have other members of our household and other things that become a part of our daily existence, he says, "Make sure that the Word of God, the Word of Christ, dwells within you." He is part of your daily experience and he says, "Let it dwell within you richly."
[time=2983] Then Paul goes on to give a couple of very significant ways in which the Word of Christ can become a part of our daily existence individually, corporately.
[time=2993] Would you notice he says that that should happen with all wisdom whenever we admonish
[time=2999] one another?
[time=3000] He has the idea that the body of Christ is going to be so intimate with one another that we begin to approach one another and we encourage one another with the Word of God.
[time=3010] Whenever we see that someone is discouraged, we give them the Word of Christ, the Word of God.
[time=3015] Whenever we see that someone is joyful, we give them a word of praise from the Word of God.
[time=3021] Whenever someone is stepping out of line, out of obedience from the Word of God, we are
[time=3027] to give them the Word of God.
[time=3029] We are to admonish them with all wisdom.
[time=3033] But notice he suggests yet another way in which the Word of God can become our will and our way.
[time=3040] He says as you admonish one another with all wisdom and as you sing Psalms and hymns and
[time=3047] spiritual songs.
[time=3050] I don't think, as some might suggest, that Paul is talking about three different kinds of music there.
[time=3055] He's talking about music in general.
[time=3057] Every time we sing corporately, we are admonishing one another about what God says in his word
[time=3063] and it ought to happen.
[time=3065] He ought to happen frequently in our own private worlds as we gather together as the body of Christ.
[time=3071] It ought to happen so that God's Word becomes our will, our mindset, our way in the world
[time=3077] in which we live.
[time=3081] When I was driving here to Fort Wayne yesterday, my friend gave me a map in terms of telling
[time=3088] me how to get to the motel and then how to get to the church this morning.
[time=3093] I'm a bit of an obsessive, compulsive personality and I had that map with me everywhere.
[time=3098] I had it in my coat pocket and get into the car and I had it on the seat there in front of me and I was constantly looking down and picking up that map.
[time=3107] Go to this route and make a right and go a few miles and then make a left and I was constantly reading that map.
[time=3114] This might not surprise you and maybe for some it will, but when I arrived in Fort Wayne, you know I had that map memorized.
[time=3121] The reason for that is because it was in my mind constantly on that trip.
[time=3126] That's the way it should be with the Word of God.
[time=3130] My friend Dr. Haddon Robinson says, "You want to know the will of God for your life?"
[time=3137] He said, "Well a match in Jesus Christ sending out an announcement and saying, 'I want you to gather together at the Los Angeles Coliseum and I'm going to tell you how you can know my will.'" And so people come from all over the world together into the Coliseum and finally
[time=3153] Christ comes to the podium and he says, "Do you want to know my will for your life?"
[time=3160] And then at that point he holds up the scriptures and he says, "It's right in here."
[time=3168] And so it is my friend.
[time=3170] It's not necessarily found by listening to other people, it is found in the Word of God and if you want to restore the wonder of Christmas, make sure your world becomes
[time=3181] a world of worship.
[time=3183] Do you know how that happens?
[time=3184] It happens whenever you make peace a priority, whenever you maintain an attitude of gratitude
[time=3191] and whenever you make God's Word your will and your way in life.
[time=3200] We live in a world of hustle and bustle and the wonder of Christmas can come and go and
[time=3206] we can be very disappointed but there is a fourth thing that we can do.
[time=3211] We find it in verse 17.
[time=3214] Paul says, "In whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the
[time=3220] Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him." Do you know what he's saying there?
[time=3226] He's saying, "If we are somehow going to maintain worlds of worship individually as
[time=3232] well as corporately, it is imperative that we make the routine a place of reverence."
[time=3240] Let me talk about what I mean when I talk about the routine.
[time=3242] I'm talking about whatever happens in your world wherever God might have placed you.
[time=3248] Some of you have circumstances and situations right now where you'd like to be out of them.
[time=3254] It may be a marriage that is not going the way you want it to go.
[time=3258] It could be a job that you would like to discard altogether and never go back again and you say, "I hate this.
[time=3265] I wish I wasn't here.
[time=3266] I want to challenge you this morning to make that a place where God has put you and then
[time=3273] in turn to sanctify that place and make it a sanctuary of reverence.
[time=3279] The reason I can say that is because the Lord Christ is there with you.
[time=3285] And wherever you are, the Apostle Paul says, "Whatever you do in word or deed, do it heartily
[time=3292] is under the Lord." Now, why would you do that?
[time=3294] You do that because you realize all of a sudden that he's there with you.
[time=3298] Christ is present and whatever you're doing, you're doing in his presence.
[time=3302] So he says, "And whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him." That doesn't mean necessarily that you have to like everything that you do.
[time=3315] One of the best things is perhaps to tell God that, "God, I don't necessarily like this routine.
[time=3320] I don't necessarily enjoy what I'm doing, but you're here and I'm doing this in your
[time=3326] presence.
[time=3327] I'm worshiping you in the task that I carry out." You see, so often we think that worship takes place in a certain building.
[time=3337] A church building, that's where we worship.
[time=3339] Or perhaps it takes place whenever we get together in our Bible study group, but we forget the fact that worship also takes place 24 hours a day wherever God has placed us.
[time=3350] And if we're going to restore the wonder of Christmas, it is imperative that we somehow
[time=3356] make the routine a place of reverence.
[time=3361] A great Bible teacher, Harry Ironside, told about the early days of his youth whenever
[time=3370] he was being trained as an apprentice shoemaker.
[time=3374] He was in the shop of a Christian man and it was one of the practices of that shoemaking
[time=3382] shop that they would always take the leather and soak it in water day in and day out.
[time=3388] The purpose was to make the leather more durable and it would make a better shoe.
[time=3392] Ironside didn't know that initially, and one day he was visiting another shop where one of his friends worked.
[time=3398] He noticed that they always seemed to skip that step.
[time=3401] They didn't soak the leather in the water.
[time=3404] And so Ironside asked about it and his friend kind of smiled and said, "Oh no, we don't do that in this shop." He said, "You see, we want our customers to come back." And so when you don't soak the leather, the shoes wear out faster and the customers come back sooner.
[time=3419] Ironside thought, "That's a great idea, I'm going to have to tell my boss that." And so he went back to his master and he told him what was happening, he said, "You know, we ought to do the same thing." And his master looked at him and said, "No, we can't do it, not in this shop."
[time=3436] Because he said, "I have dedicated this shop to God.
[time=3439] God dwells here." And he said, "If we skip that step," he said, "I can just imagine someday standing before the Savior, and he's going to put all of those worn out shoes in front of me." No, it will not happen here.
[time=3454] That shop owner knew something about making a place of routine a place of reverence.
[time=3462] Have you found it in your life?
[time=3464] You can, wherever God has placed you, if you dedicate that place by an act of the will and say, "This is going to be a place where I do everything for the glory of the Lord Christ." And when you do that consciously day in and day out, the wonder of life, the wonder of your faith returns, and so does the wonder of Christmas.
[time=3486] To restore the wonder of Christmas, make your world individually, as well as corporately, a world of worship.
[time=3492] You do that whenever you make peace a priority, whenever you begin to maintain an attitude of gratitude, whenever you choose to make God's Word your will for your life, whenever you
[time=3503] make the routine.
[time=3504] Please.
[time=3505] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our teen choir and from soloist
[time=3512] Reid LaFavor.
[time=3514] The message today was from our special guest, Dr. Harry Shields from Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=3521] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3528] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3531] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3538] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3541] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3547] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3551] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
