[time=0] - My name to celebrate because indeed, we have much to be thankful for.
[time=5] Thank you for your great salvation and the privilege to fellowship.
[time=10] (bell chimes)
[time=90] (bell chimes) 1991 presents more than enough challenges to occupy our energy.
[time=98] The question now is how do we invest our energy?
[time=102] What does God want us to do?
[time=105] I'd like to suggest this morning that perhaps we have overlooked the most important fact that ought to be faced by us and that's the simple fact of getting to know God better.
[time=115] I recently read an article that talked about functional atheism.
[time=120] We say we believe, but we act as if everything depends on us.
[time=125] Today, let's do our best to get to know God again.
[time=129] (upbeat music) - Welcome to an hour of Bible study,
[time=141] music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=143] Thank you for joining us.
[time=145] Our guest speaker today is the president of Summit Christian College, Dr. Don Gehrig.
[time=152] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us as he shares with us what the Lord has laid on his heart.
[time=158] Special music today includes a song from Read La Favour, accompanied by the Living Christmas Tree Choir and a solo from Keith Brodigam.
[time=167] Let's join our service now with a song from the Living Christmas Tree Choir entitled, "Joy to the World." ("Joy to the World")

[time=774] Imagine how it could be this Holy God with strength and mind reaching out into the night just to bring the gift of heaven's love down to me.
[time=798] He will, he will, he will, son of God, he will, he will, he will, he will, he will.
[time=814] Our Savior's love, our Father's love, our Father Emmanuel.
[time=842] He will, he will, he will, he will, he will.
[time=863] Thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour today. I suppose many of you have already taken down your Christmas decorations and this is the week that we'll be dismantling the living Christmas tree and this is our last Sunday for us to participate and have the choir sing from the tree.
[time=885] We had a wonderful two weeks of ministry with ten concerts and many of you came to the concerts and we're just delighted that we had this opportunity to minister this way and I received a number of letters.
[time=896] I wanted to share just a couple letters with you of what people said about the living Christmas tree.
[time=902] This one says my family and I are still rejoicing over the performance of the LCT last Saturday.
[time=907] We have been coming to the tree for many years and I believe this year's was the best we've witnessed in a long time.
[time=914] Not saying that the other year's performances weren't good, it's just that this year was especially wonderful.
[time=920] Being a Christian and coming to a performance like the LCT really makes you feel good. Praise the Lord.
[time=927] It is great when we can rejoice in the wonderful and precious name of the Lord.
[time=932] And then another letter said I've been able to see your production the last couple of years. I thoroughly enjoy it.
[time=938] The performance is spectacular yet the message is not lost in the glitter. Your efforts are all worthwhile. Keep up the good work.
[time=947] Another person said I knew before the concert that I was in for a treat but what I thought I was in for was only a fraction of what I received.
[time=954] I felt so warm and welcome when the choir made its appearance chanting Merry Christmas and glad you could make it as they walked to the stage.
[time=962] The hustle and bustle which I left outside was replaced with feelings of joy and praise for our Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=970] And then one more said I really appreciate the living Christmas tree programs have only missed one or two since your church presented it.
[time=977] Oh we're very thankful that you responded to the living Christmas tree and I hope that it made your Christmas time just a little bit more enjoyable
[time=985] and a renewed appreciation for the Savior who came during that time and eventually died for our sins and rose again.
[time=993] That is the message of the Bible and the Bible our telecast.
[time=997] I want to remind you of a date that's coming up in January. It's at the very end of January. On January 31st that's a Thursday evening.
[time=1005] At 7 p.m. we will host Dr. John MacArthur. Dr. MacArthur is a famed author and radio speaker.
[time=1012] Will be in our area that evening for a media rally. I hope that you'll set that day to sight and come and join with us. That'll be a great evening.
[time=1020] We've enjoyed many guest speakers and not too many months ago we had Dr. Don Gary who's with us again today. Good morning Dr. Gary.
[time=1028] Good morning Pete. It's just great to have you in our city and know that you're on the other side of town working with young people at Summit Christian College.
[time=1036] I was talking to you earlier about the ministry that you have not only with the young people but we received from time to time as pastors of local churches
[time=1045] information on seminars that you have for pastors and Christian workers in our local churches. Tell us a little bit about some of those opportunities.
[time=1055] Well we offer two week seminars at some points. We also have night courses that are offered some weekend classes. We try to gear those two Christian workers and people involved in ministry.
[time=1067] I think of special interest this year toward the end of January. We're having a four day sequence where we'll have a two day session on church growth principles and then another two days on church planting.
[time=1080] For the first two days Dr. Charles Lake will be with us and then the last two days Dr. Bob Logan from Fuller Seminary will be there and we're looking forward to this opportunity to expose some of the area pastors and church leaders.
[time=1094] Some of the principals involved in extending the kingdom through church growth and church planting.
[time=1099] You know both of those men are well known and certainly have a great track record in their respective areas especially as I think of Pastor Lake even here right in our own state has done much in church growth and church planting and we really appreciate his ministry in the southern part of our state.
[time=1116] So I'm thankful for those opportunities. I know it's difficult sometimes for pastors to get away for an extended period of time and go to other parts of the country.
[time=1125] So having these seminars is a great encouragement to the pastors and I want to thank you for doing that.
[time=1130] And if you're watching today and you want more information concerning Christian education, growth seminars, how to develop programs for your church, you need to call or write Summit Christian College and just ask for some of that information.
[time=1146] Get on their mailing list and be aware of the things that the school is doing.
[time=1150] Pastor, we look forward to your preaching in just a few minutes and I'm always glad that you're at Black Hawk and consider you a great friend of our church.
[time=1158] Well, it's just wonderful to be here. Thank you.
[time=1160] Just before we go back to the live portion of our program, I want to remind you of the devotional booklet that we're beginning right the first part of January entitled Fresh Moments.
[time=1171] This is a brand new book offered by the Bible Hour and if you're a member of the Founders Club, you should have received it in your home already.
[time=1178] If you have friends or you're watching today and you're not a member of the Founders Club but would like to receive this booklet for the first time, please write us today for the first copy of Fresh Moments.
[time=1189] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1208] Thank you very much for joining us for the Bible Hour today. I hope that you'll tune in throughout the entire year and that God will bless you richly for it.
[time=1216] Thank you and we go back to the live portion of our program right now.
[time=1246] [MUSIC - 115 seconds]
[time=1381] Thank you Keith and Scott for that ministry of music. That's about together in prayer, shall we?
[time=1390] Father, we thank you that we can come and we can be still and know that you are God, that we can come and ask for your strength and guidance in this day.
[time=1403] We can thank you for the many things for which we are thankful and we can come on behalf of other people who need prayer today.
[time=1414] We thank you that we can hurt together and we can uphold one another in time of death and tragedy.
[time=1426] Lord, we pray that you will just be with Lloyd Wollman and Gary and Jim and their families and the loss of the wife and mother.
[time=1436] That you'll just strengthen them. Yesterday at the memorial service we spoke of the peace that you give and it is unique and different and passes all understanding, but we ask for that in the coming days as they begin to mend their lives and go on living.
[time=1452] We rejoice when we see two young people that love the Lord come together and marriage. We pray that you'll bless Kathy and Andy Rang as they begin their life together.
[time=1464] They indeed might put you at the center of their marriage and depend on you and use the word of God as a direction for their lives and their marriage together.
[time=1475] Bless them and give them a wonderful, long life. Lord, there are people who are ill. We pray for Ken Harris who's in the hospital today that you will just strengthen his life.
[time=1487] Give the doctors wisdom to know what they should do as it relates to surgery that his body might be strong enough to withstand what is necessary to do.
[time=1499] Lord, we pray for our young men in the armed services that you'll just keep them calm and you'll give direction to the leaders of our country to know what to do.
[time=1510] And we pray that we will continue to be found faithful in praying for strength for our men and also for our leaders that you'll give them wisdom.
[time=1519] We thank you that we can come together here today to celebrate the wonderful birth of the Savior and that that's on our minds today because of the salvation you've given us.
[time=1528] We thank you for the music we've had and we pray that you will open our hearts to the message and we'll receive those things which will be a great blessing to our lives and strengthen us here together.
[time=1539] And we pray that all will be done for your honor and glory in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1546] Every city that has a Christian college has a unique privilege to benefit from that Christian college. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, there's no exception.
[time=1554] We have Summit Christian College. Some of our young people attend Summit. Also, we have many graduates who are part of our congregation here.
[time=1563] We take advantage of evening classes that they offer and also seminars for pastors and Christian workers that are often available to us.
[time=1571] And we're also, all of us, probably 100% of us have listened at one time or another to WBCLFM and have indeed been blessed by that radio ministry there coming from the college.
[time=1582] We also consider the President, Dr. Donald Gehrig, to be a friend of Black Hawk Baptist Church and a friend for the community.
[time=1589] We're delighted that he can come today and speak from our pulpit. We do treasure him as a great friend of Black Hawk Baptist Church and are glad he's here today.
[time=1597] So would you welcome please with me, Dr. Donald Gehrig, the President of Summit Christian College.
[time=1602] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1609] It's always good to be back at Black Hawk and share this time of worship with you. I thoroughly enjoy it.
[time=1615] It's a great season, isn't it? There are so many parts of it that are so positive.
[time=1621] I do have to confess I felt a little tinge of, I don't know, panic almost though, as I sat here this morning so close to this tree and started realizing how many wrapped presents there were on that tree yet.
[time=1639] The way I wrapped presents, you have to understand that would just be awful if they said to me, "You've got to do those."
[time=1647] It would not come out looking nearly as nice. Well, it's a wonderful time though.
[time=1652] I think the truth of this season is one that we just keep taking in and taking in and even though we know the stories, there's a certain sense in which it just keeps being reinforced in a very positive way.
[time=1666] I remember a little Sunday school girl in the first church that I pastored out in Central Illinois.
[time=1672] We had asked her to read the Christmas story in a program and hadn't realized that she wasn't real familiar with Scripture and with some of the words in the Bible.
[time=1683] She came to that part in Luke that talks about how Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[time=1691] Well, she came to a word she wasn't sure of, so she just took the next best thing and she said, "Mary kept all these things and pounded them in her heart."
[time=1701] Well, that's not bad theology actually. We take what God has given us and pounded into our hearts.
[time=1710] Now, having said that about the season, however, I want to be among the first to start the transition.
[time=1717] May I to a new year and talk a little bit about what lays ahead of us?
[time=1723] I came across an article a few weeks ago that I was reading that included a phrase that intrigued me.
[time=1732] The phrase was functional atheism. The writer went on to explain that for many of us as Christians, we run the risk of talking about how God should be an active part of our lives.
[time=1750] We talk about how God must be the one who comes along to intervene and help in the events and situations around us.
[time=1761] We talk about how important he should be, but we end up acting as if everything depends on us.
[time=1771] And we take on all of God's responsibilities. We try to do it all ourselves, and we get our classic American burnout while we try to do everything.
[time=1784] We become functional atheists.
[time=1790] He was calling in that article for people to consider the inner life to be just as important, or maybe even more important than the life around us.
[time=1803] I got to thinking about that with a new year coming on. It's very easy for us to look ahead to the new year and begin to plot out all of the things we are going to do.
[time=1816] Here's what we are going to do with our own personal lives. Here's what we are going to do in our work lives.
[time=1823] Here's what we are going to do in school, community affairs, etc. And we are busy plotting what we will do.
[time=1833] And we forget that perhaps the first step ought to be what we are going to do about what happens inside us in our walk with God.
[time=1844] That inner life ought to have a priority that sometimes gets lost in the rush to take care of all the details around us.
[time=1857] So my premise this morning would be that all of us ought to get to know God better next year. Now that sounds wonderful, doesn't it?
[time=1863] Well, there are many ways we could, but I want to suggest, well I don't know that it's different, but at least one unique path that God calls for us.
[time=1880] That is to get to know Him better through getting to know and obey His commands.
[time=1889] Now before you walk out on me, hang on, I want to, I think illustrate that that's a pretty good way to get to know God.
[time=1898] I understand that some people view that as a very threatening way to get to know God.
[time=1904] In fact there are a lot of us I think who have grown up with a bit the idea that God is mean and out to get us.
[time=1913] I run into this all the time as I talk to people, God is one who hides behind the bush and tries to watch and see the first time we do something wrong and then pounce on us and say, "Aha, I got you."
[time=1926] And we have this rather threatening judgmental picture of God.
[time=1932] And there are some who because they don't like that have sort of gone all the way to the other end of the extreme and have said, "Well, God doesn't really care about much of anything after all."
[time=1942] You know, this is the happy God who goes on shopping trips with us.
[time=1946] That's about as far as we get in our understanding of God.
[time=1949] And I would want to suggest to you that both of those are wrong, that those are extremes we need to avoid and that somewhere in between is the true God who's worth getting to know and whose commands aren't a bad way to get to know Him.
[time=1966] That if we would concentrate on knowing those commands and obeying them, we would find God to be someone we want to know and would like to know.
[time=1978] The background for our study this morning comes out of the fifth chapter of 1 John, John's first letter toward the back of the New Testament.
[time=1987] And the first five verses of that chapter, there are some interesting thoughts about God and His commands and how we might get to know Him through them.
[time=2000] It reads this way, "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves His child as well.
[time=2011] This is how we know that we love the children of God by loving God and carrying out His commands.
[time=2019] This is love for God to obey His commands, and His commands are not burdensome, for everyone born of God overcomes the world.
[time=2031] This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Only He who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
[time=2043] I'm particularly attracted to the middle part of that passage in verse 3, "This is love for God to obey His commands, and His commands are not burdensome."
[time=2058] That's quite a statement, isn't it? For we often think of God's commands as being quite burdensome, but John is very clear about his attitude and approach toward the subject.
[time=2071] Now, let's raise the question, and then I want to try to answer it a bit this morning. Why is it John can say that God's commands are not burdensome?
[time=2082] Well, the first reason I would give is because those commands are not essential to salvation.
[time=2090] Now, let's get this very straight this morning. John seems to make a clear distinction between those who are born of God and now are to be followers of God and His commands.
[time=2103] Nowhere does he suggest that we become children of God by obeying His commands. Rather, we obey His commands because we already are children of God, and there's an immense difference between those two starting points.
[time=2120] In fact, he talks several times in this passage about being born of God. He talks about overcoming the world through our faith that those who believe are the ones that are born of God.
[time=2132] That's very clear that salvation comes through faith, through what He has done.
[time=2139] And once we become His children, then we can be called on to obey His commands, but never is the burden placed on us that we must obey all His commands before we can be His children.
[time=2155] Jesus even rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for this mistake. He said, they try to lay on you burdens that are too heavy.
[time=2164] They try to put the impossible on your backs, and that is to be perfect like God. We can't be that perfect.
[time=2172] And it's only as the perfection of Christ is in us that we stand before God.
[time=2179] Jesus, by contrast, invited people to come unto Him, all ye who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[time=2188] My yoke is easy, he said. My burden is light. I have done for you what is necessary for salvation.
[time=2197] Now I call you to come with me and obey God.
[time=2204] I remember one day getting a phone call, and my office is when I was pastoring.
[time=2210] It was a lady in our congregation. She said, Pastor, I've been witnessing to a friend of mine, and we seem to be hitting deadlock.
[time=2218] Could we come and talk to you? Sure.
[time=2221] So they came, showed up in my office, and the lady to whom she had been witnessing was just full of questions about what it meant to be a Christian,
[time=2230] and full of a considerable bit of confusion, quite frankly, as well.
[time=2237] As we talked, we tried to sort through this whole business of what it means to become a Christian,
[time=2244] and how Christ has done for us what we could not do for ourselves, and so forth.
[time=2249] All of a sudden, just out of a clear blue sky, this gal jumped up and said, "I'm ready to pray."
[time=2256] And she knelt down to the rest of us looked at each other, and we knelt down with her, and she began to pray.
[time=2262] Just simply poured out her heart to God and invited Christ to become her Savior. It was a beautiful time.
[time=2269] She got up from praying and made a statement I will never forget.
[time=2275] She said, Pastor, I used to think that there was a chalkboard in my life that had all of these rules on that God was telling me,
[time=2285] I had to obey before I could be a Christian.
[time=2289] And that kept me from becoming a Christian for a long time.
[time=2292] I knew I couldn't live up to that set of rules, or I was sure I couldn't.
[time=2298] She said, "Today, for some reason, it suddenly dawned on me that Christ had erased the chalkboard for me."
[time=2308] And Christ had erased the chalkboard for me, and I didn't have to worry about that in order to become a Christian.
[time=2316] I just had to receive Him.
[time=2321] Now, what a difference. What a difference when God begins by assuring us.
[time=2328] Once we have placed our trusting Christ, assuring us that we are now His child, and then saying,
[time=2335] "Here are some things I want you to do," to approach it that way rather than starting out by saying,
[time=2342] "You must do all of this, or I won't accept you." No, it's true. His commands are not burdensome.
[time=2353] There was another reason why they're not burdensome according to this passage.
[time=2357] That is that He wants to be our helper in obeying them.
[time=2361] He doesn't simply say to us, "Here they are. Do them. I'm going to check up your scorecard when I come back."
[time=2369] No, there is this idea throughout the passage that victory comes through faith, through an active relationship with God.
[time=2381] That's what faith is. Faith is living out reality that we believe.
[time=2390] And if we believe that Christ is real, that He lives in us through faith,
[time=2396] then we know that He is there to help us in achieving what He wants us to do.
[time=2402] He is our partner in the process.
[time=2411] Modern miracle of technology.
[time=2419] The eyes are back in the booth going crazy about now.
[time=2426] There's no way to cough when this thing's right under your face, you know, so you just have to get rid of it for a little bit.
[time=2432] There.
[time=2435] When Christ lives in us and becomes our partner, when we really get to know Him so well that we start to think like He does,
[time=2447] we start to believe what He says.
[time=2450] We begin to live like He is a partner. It's sort of like marriage, you know.
[time=2455] When you really love someone and you live with them long enough, you know ahead of time what's coming, don't you?
[time=2462] It's how it is with parents and children.
[time=2465] God talked about that in one of the Psalms where He mentions that He wants to lead us with His eye.
[time=2471] That's intimate knowledge. My mom could do that to me all the time, you know.
[time=2477] She led me with her eye. It's all it took.
[time=2481] Well, that's the sort of relationship that's implied in faith, in walking with God so closely that we come to know what He wants.
[time=2492] That's why Scripture suggests over and over that our minds need to be filled with the things of God.
[time=2499] That's how we come to appreciate and understand His commands.
[time=2503] Romans 12 talks about our minds being renewed by the, we should be renewed by the transformation of our minds.
[time=2511] Philippians, He talks about the fact that we're to set our minds on things such that are true and honorable and a good report and so on.
[time=2519] Romans 8, He talks about how the person who walks by the Spirit sets his mind on the things of the Spirit.
[time=2525] In the Old Testament, even, as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.
[time=2530] That whole concept of saturating ourselves with our partner, with our friend Jesus,
[time=2538] that as we get to know Him, as we walk the faith, walk with Him, He becomes our helper.
[time=2547] Modern psychology is telling us this now, like it's some new discovery.
[time=2552] Management people are telling us that; Earl Nightingale is making a myth, you know, going around with his speech about you become what you think about most of the time.
[time=2561] Well, that's not new, that's as old as Scripture.
[time=2565] That's a truth God has built in, and if we will walk with Him, if we will have this faith walk with Christ,
[time=2572] He becomes our partner, our helper, and we become overcomers.
[time=2578] We find that obeying His commands now are a natural part of our response,
[time=2585] not something that has to be externally imposed upon us by somebody else.
[time=2591] So His commands are not burdensome as long as He's willing to help us.
[time=2598] Well, there's two reasons. They're not burdensome because they're not really part of salvation.
[time=2603] They're following that. They're not burdensome because He wants to help us with them.
[time=2609] They're also not burdensome because the motivation for obedience is always love rather than fear.
[time=2616] That's the third reason.
[time=2618] I'm intrigued that in a passage like this, where so much is being said about commands,
[time=2625] you also have a corresponding weight on love.
[time=2630] Did you catch that in verse 3? This is love for God that you obey His commands.
[time=2637] He puts together those two ideas.
[time=2641] No threat, no judgmental approach to it, but rather the pull of love.
[time=2650] When you get to know God better, as He becomes your faith partner, you want to obey.
[time=2658] You don't have to obey. What a difference.
[time=2662] The minute His commands start to be part of the want-to response, they are no longer burdensome.
[time=2669] And let's face it, we will do for love a whole lot more than we will ever do out of threat.
[time=2679] One o'clock one morning, I was awakened by the phone.
[time=2684] And voice on the other end was a fellow from our church who was down in Mexico with a group of our men who were there on a mission trip.
[time=2692] They had been visiting some of our missionaries. They had done some work down there for the National Christians.
[time=2698] They were now in Mexico City on their last night before returning home.
[time=2703] The call came to let me know that without warning, one of them, 49-year-old fella, had just slumped dead in his room there in Mexico City.
[time=2718] One of his sons was on the trip with him, was in the room, saw his dad die.
[time=2724] I was being called because I had to go now and tell his wife what had happened to the other kids at one o'clock in the morning.
[time=2731] That's not a happy assignment, I want to tell you.
[time=2735] So at one o'clock I was at the door and greeted Marianne and of course she knew almost immediately something was wrong.
[time=2742] You just don't get calls from your pastor at the door at one o'clock in the morning unless something has happened.
[time=2748] The thing that intrigued me was this, by 2.30 there had to be at least 20 people in that house helping already.
[time=2760] I to this day have no idea how that word got around that fast.
[time=2767] But I think I could stand here and put my next paycheck on this one.
[time=2773] I don't think anybody got a call that went like this.
[time=2778] George has just died, you've got to get over and help.
[time=2787] I rather suspect that as the word got around these were people who came to help because they wanted to.
[time=2794] We loved Marianne, we loved that family, we wanted to be of help to them and we were there, not because somebody said,
[time=2801] "If you're a good Christian, you will go over there at 2.30 in the morning and help."
[time=2808] We were there because we wanted to be there and do what we could.
[time=2813] That, my friends, is exactly the motivation that John is talking about here.
[time=2819] If you love God, then you want to obey His commands.
[time=2825] That relationship is never burdensome.
[time=2829] Now, there's a fourth reason I'd like to add, it's really not in the passage, but I really feel compelled to add it yet.
[time=2840] A fourth reason why His commands are not burdensome is that they make so much sense.
[time=2845] We sometimes have the idea that God has created commands that don't make sense just to see if He can get us to do it or not.
[time=2855] Like God is playing some sort of game with us, you know.
[time=2859] Let's see, I'm going to make up some cock of maybe a kind of command and just see whether or not they'll really do it.
[time=2865] Well, I'm here to tell you, my friends, that's not the kind of God we serve.
[time=2869] God's commands make all the sense in the world.
[time=2872] I had a friend who told me one time, even if I wasn't a Christian, I'd obey the Ten Commandments, they just make so much sense.
[time=2879] And that's absolutely true.
[time=2882] Take any one of them and follow it through.
[time=2885] I did a whole series of messages one time on the Ten Commandments, and I entitled it the Ten Great Freedoms.
[time=2892] Because in every case, you could argue very effectively that you are the winner, not the loser, if you obey those commands.
[time=2902] Take a society like ours which is so messed up in the whole area of sexuality and then throw in front of it a command that says, "Don't commit adultery."
[time=2911] The world in its wisdom, I put quotes around that, goes out and says, "What a silly command!
[time=2918] What a narrow, confining command!
[time=2922] We don't have to obey that command." And what do they get in return?
[time=2928] Heartache, broken relationships, disease, let me go down the list.
[time=2935] I obey the command and I don't fear disease, I don't worry about guilt, I don't worry about losing my job through some sort of scandal.
[time=2943] I have a happy marriage, I actually enjoy going home at night. Can you believe it? It's wonderful.
[time=2948] We have a great time together.
[time=2953] I've got two kids who are relatively well-adjusted, it seems to me.
[time=2959] They had two parents, just like both of their parents had.
[time=2966] I mean, this is not a bad deal, you understand? This makes a lot of sense. I've come off the winner by following God's commands, that's not burdensome.
[time=2977] That's not a bad deal, it's worked.
[time=2982] And I'm just simply suggesting to you today that that's another good reason to get to know God through His commands because they just make so very good, such a very good sense.
[time=2993] Well, I don't want to leave you with the wrong impression, and I hasten to say one more thing before we're done today.
[time=3001] By saying that His commands are not burdensome, I don't mean to say that they are necessarily always easy.
[time=3010] There's a difference. Not burdensome does not equal easy all the time.
[time=3020] There are some times when it does take discipline to obey God's commands, to be willing to study and discover what they are and then adjust our lives to fit.
[time=3032] It's not always easy. It's like marriage again. Two days ago, stood in front of my niece and her husband now performed a ceremony for their wedding.
[time=3042] And they again pledged to each other through good times and bad, through health and sickness, through wealth and poverty and so on.
[time=3050] We understand that there are times when it isn't all as exciting and glorious as it is on that wedding day.
[time=3057] And those are times when we choose to love our means.
[time=3064] Love is a choice. And so it is here. There are going to be times when in obeying God, we choose to love God by obeying His commands.
[time=3075] Not necessarily easy, but not burdensome. You say, "How can it be now it's one or the other?" No, no, no, no.
[time=3082] Let me illustrate. I think I can illustrate very easily for you. If you are like me, whenever the Olympics come on, you're hooked.
[time=3092] I tell myself before it starts now, I'm not going to spend so much time in front of the two watching this stuff and then I get hooked.
[time=3099] I just am enthralled with the competition. And over and over and over, you'll hear the story.
[time=3105] This teenager who's competing in, you know, fill in the blanks, swimming, track, whatever, has gone through years of training.
[time=3113] You know, they go to school, they run over to the gym afterwards or over to the pool.
[time=3117] They give up the extra activities because they're disciplining themselves to get in condition and to practice and to get better and to become eligible now to compete in the Olympics.
[time=3127] In some cases, they're competing in a contest that may only take a few seconds and they have devoted years of preparation for that few seconds of competition.
[time=3140] Now, was that easy? Not in your life. If they took that seriously, that was tough stuff. They worked hard.
[time=3152] If people who don't work hard are the ones you don't see on the Olympics, you know?
[time=3158] That was hard work. Wasn't easy. Was it burdensome?
[time=3165] No. Just put that middle around your neck and there wasn't burdensome at all.
[time=3174] It was a very profitable investment of whatever it took to be there.
[time=3181] Folks, I'm suggesting that the God we get to know, the God who has given us commands and guidance in life,
[time=3190] there's going to come a day when he's going to put the middle around our necks.
[time=3196] And if ever there was a question before, it will certainly be gone then.
[time=3202] Whatever I did to please him was not burdensome.
[time=3210] It may not have always been easy, but it was never burdensome.
[time=3214] I want to suggest to you that that's what God gets worth getting to know this year.
[time=3219] There are a lot of ways to get to know God. A lot of paths you can take and they're legitimate,
[time=3225] but it may be that this would be a new one.
[time=3229] This year, this new year, what I will do is covenant to discover as much as I can what God wants me to do.
[time=3238] What is his perfect and acceptable and pleasing will as Paul puts it in Romans 12?
[time=3245] What does he want for me? I can look for those things, not be afraid.
[time=3250] Ignorance doesn't save me here, but I can discover what he wants me to do with confidence
[time=3256] because I know that whatever I discover, it will never be burdensome.
[time=3261] It will always be good.
[time=3264] I know that he will accept me as his child even as at times I struggle with what he wants me to do.
[time=3271] I know that during those times of struggle he will help me because he is my faith partner.
[time=3279] I know that his love will always be there to pull me and entice me to make me want to do what he wants.
[time=3288] I know his commands make sense, so I can go to the Word and I can look for what he wants.
[time=3294] I can seek his will with utter confidence, and in the process I will find him to be my friend.
[time=3308] And I don't know. I'm not a prognosticator, so I don't know what's coming in 1991.
[time=3314] And all that might be ahead of us. I do know that whatever happens out there, however,
[time=3321] is only second in importance to what happens in here.
[time=3328] And that I want to be my goal. I don't want to be a functional atheist.
[time=3334] I want God to be an active part of my life, and I hope you do too.
[time=3341] Lord, you have lovingly called us to be your children through faith in Christ.
[time=3348] Thank you for what you have done for us in Him.
[time=3352] Now grant that we may be good children, loving children, obedient children, for your glory in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3371] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music through our Living Christmas Tree Choir and soloist Reed LaFavor.
[time=3383] We also appreciate the ministry of soloist Keith Brodigam.
[time=3387] The message today was from our special guest Dr. Donald Gary, who is President of Summit Christian College in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3395] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, just before we close, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3404] Please pray along with me.
[time=3407] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending the babe in the manger to be our Savior
[time=3413] and to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3416] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3419] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3424] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3428] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3433] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3441] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the devotional guide "Fresh Moments", please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
