[time=1546] I am, I am, I am, I am.
[time=1576] I am, I am.
[time=1586] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1592] Thank you, singers.
[time=1599] We're certainly blessed with that statement.
[time=1603] Jesus Christ said, I am.
[time=1607] Pastor Bill Ella has been with life action just since January, July of 1990.
[time=1613] Formerly, he was the pastor for 10 years of Trinity Baptist Church in Norman, Oklahoma.
[time=1619] And you'll recognize that he's not from Indiana as soon as he begins to speak.
[time=1625] He has had the revival teams of life action in his church a number of times and felt led of the Lord to join life action ministries this summer.
[time=1634] And as it's a wonderful ministry, there is some literature out in the foyer.
[time=1639] And I hope that you can get to know and even pray more intelligently for all of the ministries of life action as a result of today.
[time=1647] We've had some good music, and we've been blessed by that.
[time=1650] But we're going to be blessed in a moment with great preaching.
[time=1653] Before Pastor Bill comes to speak, though, I want Dee Thompson to come and sing a song.
[time=1658] It's entitled, We Need the Lord.
[time=1659] Did you just open your heart now as she sings and let the Lord speak to you and make that commitment this year that you are going to serve God with all your heart?
[time=1668] [MUSIC]
[time=1689] When we need the Lord, we need to know His grace
[time=1708] to seek His Holidays above the world's acclaim.
[time=1717] We need the Lord.
[time=1722] We need His Majesty to lend us dignity and make us worthy
[time=1733] of His name.
[time=1737] We need to see Him there everywhere we turn.
[time=1746] We need to look for Him, and how we need to learn,
[time=1755] how we need to learn.
[time=1759] We need the Lord.
[time=1769] We need His light to see what is eternity in ordinary daily things.
[time=1782] We need the Lord.
[time=1787] We need to cling to Him when we have breached the end of all
[time=1797] our earthly hopes and dreams, and in the dead of our King,
[time=1807] how we need the reign.
[time=1814] When He is a Lord, when we stumble in the fight,
[time=1823] He is my dear Lord, giving us hope.
[time=1834] We need the Lord.
[time=1847] We need to feel His touch.
[time=1851] We think we know so much when how much more we need to know.
[time=1860] We need the Lord.
[time=1866] We need His fire within that we might live for Him,
[time=1874] and in His grace may grow.
[time=1880] Oh, how much we need to know.
[time=1892] Oh, how much we need the Lord.
[time=1922] He was a psalmist David who cried out to thee.
[time=1931] I lift up my eyes without who art enthroned in the heavens,
[time=1937] behold, as the eyes of a servant look to the hand of the master, and as the eyes of a maid look to her mistress.
[time=1947] So, O Lord, our eyes look to thee.
[time=1956] It was David's heart cry constantly and consistently to say, Lord, God, I need you.
[time=1966] I wonder, this morning, if that is the cry of your heart,
[time=1973] if you came here to the service and into this auditorium, and you're entering in this new year with a cry of your heart,
[time=1983] Lord, I need thee.
[time=1986] Because you see, that's foundational to everything.
[time=1993] No man will ever know the Lord.
[time=1994] No man will ever see His kingdom.
[time=1996] No man will ever know all that God has for his life.
[time=2002] No man will ever be useful in God's kingdom until, first of all, and foundationally, he lives in the constant recognition of his need.
[time=2013] Would you bow together with me as we pray?
[time=2015] Because even as I stand to preach, I want to admit to you, and before the Lord, I need him, and we need him to hear from him.
[time=2023] We're not here to share opinions or ideas.
[time=2027] We're here to hear from him and seek to rightly divide his word.
[time=2031] So together, could we go to him and ask for his blessing, precious Father?
[time=2037] We need you more desperately than we realize.
[time=2044] If our eyes could ever see our true condition and the phenomenal disparity between you as the creator and us as the creatures, and how far short we are falling of the glory of God,
[time=2060] we would recognize how desperately, how daily, how hourly we need you.
[time=2066] And Lord, the cry of our heart this morning
[time=2073] is that somehow, by your spirit and through your word, you would like a hammer that shatters the rock.
[time=2082] You would drive it home in our lives, and you would shatter every rock of pride and arrogance that would raise its head and say, I don't need God.
[time=2095] And Lord, we would see our desperate state apart from you.
[time=2101] So Holy Spirit, come, you are welcome here.
[time=2105] Do the work that only you can do.
[time=2109] And we will give you praise and glory and honor that rightfully belongs to you.
[time=2115] In Jesus' precious name we pray, amen.
[time=2120] We'll take your Bibles, if you would, and turn with me to Matthew chapter 5, Matthew 5.
[time=2125] And as you're turning, let me express, as I did to the earlier crowd, what a joy it is to be with you and a privilege to share God's word.
[time=2138] We're so thankful for Pete and how he has ministered to us and our teams and in these past months and what a joy to be in this church and to stand before you and share God's word.
[time=2152] I want to ask you this morning, and I'm aware that this is the first Sunday of the new year, a fresh blank page that God has given us in his mercy and grace to write upon in this new year.
[time=2165] I want to ask you a very important question.
[time=2167] Are you experiencing the blessings of God?
[time=2172] You say, oh, Bill, why, I know there's no question I've been blessed.
[time=2176] I've got a family and financially God has blessed us and physically he's blessed us and materially and all these different things.
[time=2184] And those are all blessings of God, don't mistake me.
[time=2187] In fact, every good and perfect gift that you have in your life comes from above.
[time=2193] Amen? Every single thing you have.
[time=2196] The air that we breathe, the clothes that we wear, every bit of it comes from God.
[time=2202] And as Paul said in 1 Corinthians, he said, if everything you have is something you received, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
[time=2210] So everything we have is a blessing from God.
[time=2213] It's all a blessing.
[time=2215] But beyond the normal things that you are experiencing in life and the normal blessings of God, would you say that you're experiencing the blessing of God in a supernatural way?
[time=2229] You see, that's really what the blessing of God is.
[time=2232] The blessing of God is when God takes something normal to the realm beyond normality.
[time=2240] When God takes something natural to the realm of supernatural, for instance, when a little boy had five loaves and two fish, just a little boy like any little boy that's in this room this morning.
[time=2252] And he handed it to Jesus.
[time=2253] And Jesus, the man of God, the son of God, called out to God for his blessing.
[time=2260] And the intervention of God came in that moment.
[time=2264] And suddenly five loaves and two fish fed 5,000 plus people.
[time=2269] Now that's the blessing of God.
[time=2274] That's when God gives you ability beyond the ability that you would normally have.
[time=2278] When God is able to move into your circumstance to overcome sin, habitual sin, that you've had a problem with for years and years and years and never been able to take care of on your own.
[time=2290] And suddenly the intervention, the blessing of God comes in this new year and victory is gained in that area of sin.
[time=2297] That's when you are so far out on the limb, trusting God and believing God in the realm of your financial stewardship in all kinds of different ways that that happens, that it takes the blessing of God.
[time=2310] And you see God move in miraculous ways so much so that your children and your grandchildren stand up and say, "Dad, mother, that must have been God that provided that." Are you in a position to begin to experience the blessings of God?
[time=2331] Jesus said in John 10, "I have come to give them in life and that super abundantly." Are you experiencing in this last year, in these last six months, would you have to say, "Man, my life was a super abundant life." God took me into a dimension of living and thinking and responding and knowing Him and being used of Him that was beyond normality.
[time=2353] Or would you have to say, you know, my life is not very different than any lost man on the street, other than I'm saved and I'm on my way to heaven and I have that assurance, which is wonderful and I have nice Christian friends.
[time=2366] But in terms of super abundant living, I'm not experiencing that.
[time=2370] Or what about in the realm of your home?
[time=2372] When we leave this church in a few moments and we head to our home and when the door is shut and the shades are pulled in your home, is what goes on in your home different than what goes on in most of the homes in America?
[time=2389] Is there an overcoming of anger?
[time=2393] Is there a supernatural love that is patient and kind, never rude, never jealous, never boast, never harbors evil thoughts, never keeps a record book on my wife or my husband's sin or my children's sin, never holds thing against them.
[time=2408] A love that bears all things and believes all things and endures all things that never fails.
[time=2413] Is that kind of blessing, the blessing of God's genuine, deep, real, practical love being experienced in your home?
[time=2421] Or would you say, no, there's a lot of anger, there's a lot of bitterness, there's a lot of arguing, there's a lack of communication, there's a lack of love in our home where we haven't known much of the blessing, the intervention of God in our home this past year?
[time=2436] Well, what would it take for the blessing of God?
[time=2440] And I'm, again, reminding you that, which is beyond what you have experienced, the blessing of God, which I would call, and I believe the Bible calls real revival, God being brought in in a fresh new way in the dimension of your life so that your life is a testimony that is unmistakably clear of the evidence that the God of all the earth has taken up residence in your heart and in your home and in this church.
[time=2475] That kind of evidence, that kind of blessing, what has to happen for that kind of blessing to come?
[time=2480] Well, Jesus, when he stood before a great crowd of people one day, began to describe what life was all about and how a man comes to know the blessing of God, a relationship with God, God coming into his life and intervening in a way that gave evidence of who God really is.
[time=2501] And this is what he said.
[time=2503] It's recorded here in Matthew five, let's pick up in verse three.
[time=2506] For Jesus said, blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=2512] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2514] And then he said, blessed, here's a man who knows the blessing of God.
[time=2519] That man who mourns, for they shall be comforted and blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[time=2529] Let's pause right there.
[time=2531] Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=2532] Jesus said, if a man ever is going to know the blessings of God, he's got to be a man first of all and foundationally who is poor in spirit.
[time=2542] And by the way, I believe that these statements that Jesus makes are progressive.
[time=2549] They build one upon the other.
[time=2552] And so Jesus is laying the first statement, the first step, the cornerstone of it all.
[time=2558] And he says, here's the foundation for you in your life, in your family, in this church knowing real revival, knowing the supernatural intervention of God.
[time=2568] So the world stands up and sees the evidence of Almighty God is, first of all, a man must be poor in spirit.
[time=2577] Now what does that mean?
[time=2578] Well, it doesn't mean, as some have thought in days past, that I sell all my material possessions and go live in a monastery somewhere or go live on the side of a hill and a cave and drink bread and water.
[time=2593] Not poor materially, that's not necessarily what he's talking about.
[time=2596] I believe what Jesus was saying is this, blessed, the man who knows the intervention of God, the mighty power of God, is the man who first and foremost has come to recognize his utter spiritual poverty.
[time=2612] Blessed, happy to be envied, is the man who knows he needs me.
[time=2617] Not the man who in arrogance and primes thinks he can live his own life by his own ability and by his own power and by his own thinking by his own wisdom, but blessed, happy to be envied as a man who the spirit of God and the word of God in God's great sovereign work in his life have come to his life in such a way that he has come to a crippling recognition of his desperate need of God and his utter spiritual poverty,
[time=2646] how far short he has fallen of the glory of God.
[time=2652] Isaiah was a blessed man.
[time=2654] One of the reasons we know that he was a blessed man was because the Bible says that in the year that King Uzziah died, Isaiah saw the Lord.
[time=2661] And you know what the first response was?
[time=2664] There, when Isaiah really began to see things clearly, he fell on his face, no doubt, and said, whoa, is me.
[time=2671] I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among the people of unclean lips.
[time=2675] We are desperately in need of God.
[time=2679] We have fallen far short.
[time=2681] I need God's cleansing.
[time=2683] If I'm ever going to know God and have him intervene in my life and have his work done in me and through me, I have got to have God's work in me, and I recognize my desperate need of him.
[time=2696] Moses was a man who lived with a sense of spiritual poverty.
[time=2700] Didn't it first, trained in Pharaoh's courts and phenomenally refined and gifted and talented?
[time=2708] He was living his life on his own ability.
[time=2710] He was even going to deliver the children of Israel by his own power and his own strength.
[time=2715] And when that plan failed, he ended up in God's school for 40 years, so God could teach him lessons of spiritual poverty.
[time=2726] And we know that Moses learned his lesson well for when God finally came to him at the burning bush and said, Moses, I want you now.
[time=2733] You're ready.
[time=2734] You finally have come to that point where you're usable to me.
[time=2738] I want you to go lead my people out of Egypt.
[time=2740] And he said, Lord, I can't.
[time=2743] I don't know any ability to do anything right or good apart from you and teach you.
[time=2754] It's the same thing that I believe Paul the Apostle experienced.
[time=2758] Romans 7 to me describes Paul's experience.
[time=2762] He said, I was going along in life, and I was thinking I was doing pretty good, and then God began to convict me.
[time=2767] He uses a specific illustration of covetousness.
[time=2771] It may have been physical lust, immorality.
[time=2774] It may have been a myriad of other things.
[time=2776] But he said, suddenly I saw a new definition of sin.
[time=2780] I saw the law of God came to my heart, and I realized that sin was sin, and that sin was in me, and that sin had a penalty, and that sin was my master, and I cried out to the Lord, O wretched man that I am, who will deliver me?
[time=2797] You see, this proud Pharisee had to come to a place of spiritual poverty, before he would ever see and know the kingdom.
[time=2807] We had a tremendous blessing during this last Christmas season.
[time=2812] My wife, Holly, we have five children and one in the hanger
[time=2820] and one in heaven, so seven all together.
[time=2823] And we had her whole family came for Christmas to our home in Niles, Michigan.
[time=2828] Her brother, David, who's 32 years old, is a self-made man.
[time=2832] He's a macho man, a flyer and a pilot.
[time=2836] And he lives in Alaska and built him a cabin with his own hands and overlooking Mount McKinley.
[time=2841] And he traps and he hunts and he shoots.
[time=2844] And he does everything.
[time=2847] And he'd done that for years.
[time=2849] And we had prayed for him, because we knew he needed Christ.
[time=2854] Finally, last Christmas.
[time=2855] I had talked to him, tried to talk to him many times about Jesus, and yet he didn't have any desire for that.
[time=2862] Finally, last Christmas, in one rare moment, one night, he said to me, you know, Bill, I'm 32 years old.
[time=2867] I don't have a wife.
[time=2868] I don't have any money.
[time=2869] I don't have any children.
[time=2871] I don't have anything except my health and my body.
[time=2875] And I said, that's right, David.
[time=2878] And let me tell you how you can come to know what real life is all about.
[time=2882] And for the next four hours, we talked about Jesus.
[time=2884] And he listened for the first time.
[time=2886] But he said at the close of that time together, you know, that's nice, and that's wonderful, but it's not for me.
[time=2893] Three months later, in April of this last year, 1990, suddenly David was rushed to emergency surgery where they discovered that his intestines had ruptured.
[time=2904] And while they were working on him, trying to save his life, they also discovered that he had a rare form of cancer that doubles every 24 hours.
[time=2916] And the next days and weeks and months, as he began to face the loss of his life, potentially.
[time=2924] And he began to take chemotherapy to try to stave off the cancer.
[time=2930] And we prayed.
[time=2931] And we had people all over the country praying for David.
[time=2934] Because you see, I was concerned about his physical life.
[time=2937] But far more than that, I was deeply concerned, as we all were, that David would come to a recognition of his need.
[time=2945] And what a joy it was, Christmas, we were able to have David fly from Alaska to be with us in Niles.
[time=2954] And in one three-hour conversation one night, David said to me, Bill, in these last few weeks of months, I've done what you talked with me about last year.
[time=2964] I've cried out to Jesus and asked him to come be the Lord and the Master of my life.
[time=2969] That's all I want.
[time=2971] But a joy.
[time=2974] You see what had happened.
[time=2975] I said to David, I said, David, you know, have you thought about why God allowed you to have cancer?
[time=2982] He said, well, I've done a lot of thinking about that.
[time=2984] But most of my answers are pretty humanistic, I think.
[time=2986] Why do you think I had cancer?
[time=2989] I said, well, only God knows.
[time=2990] And he'll tell us an eternity.
[time=2992] But I tell you what, David, I wouldn't be surprised that God loved you so much.
[time=2998] He wanted your life so much that he was willing to touch the last thing you had in your hands, your last bit of ability, your last bit of strength, and to show you your frailty so you could recognize your desperate need of God.
[time=3018] And I'd far rather you have cancer and even die prematurely
[time=3024] than to be a strong man and enter the billions of years of eternity lost without Jesus.
[time=3032] I'd far rather you have that cancer and come to know him.
[time=3037] You see, Jesus said, blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=3041] You know what he was saying right there?
[time=3043] He was saying, no man can ever see the kingdom.
[time=3045] No man is ever going to know the blessing of God, the life of God, the kingdom of heaven, unless he's come to recognition of his spiritual poverty.
[time=3053] You know, I believe with all of my heart, we have had literally hundreds and thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people who have come down and I own a church who filled out a card who said, you know, I would like to become a Christian.
[time=3064] That'd be a nice thing.
[time=3066] I want to go to heaven, who doesn't want to go to heaven.
[time=3068] I'd like to have all the things that Christians have, and I'll just add this to my life and go on with my life, and then I'll go to heaven and everything will be right and everybody will think well of me and maybe even gone through baptismal waters, maybe even joined a church.
[time=3083] But they have never come to their crushing reality of their lostness, and I want to tell you folks, you can never be saved until first of all, you've been lost.
[time=3093] You never have a sense of a need of a savior until you recognize your poverty of spirit.
[time=3099] And if you have never come by God's spirit through his word to that crushing reality, I would submit to you on the basis of what Jesus says, you have never genuinely been born again.
[time=3113] Which is a pretty sobering statement.
[time=3114] You see, it's the pathway to enter into the kingdom of God,
[time=3120] to recognize my need of a savior.
[time=3123] But secondly, not only is it something that I need to have to enter the kingdom of God, it's the foundation.
[time=3129] It is the foundation stone for living the Christian life on a day-to-day basis.
[time=3133] Every day to know the blessing of God, the divine intervention of God must be built upon this foundation.
[time=3142] Lord, I need you today.
[time=3145] And I can help you discover whether or not you have a sense of spiritual poverty about your life.
[time=3153] Would you take a little test with me?
[time=3154] When'd you like to start out in 1991 by taking a test?
[time=3157] I mean, I can tell you're just thrilled about it.
[time=3160] I want you to take a little test.
[time=3162] In this test, I've given this test to a lot of different people and it has never failed to diagnose our condition of the recognition of our spiritual poverty.
[time=3171] Whether or not we really have a recognition of our need.
[time=3174] Are you ready?
[time=3175] It's just one simple little question and I want you just answered in your mind and in your heart before the Lord right now.
[time=3181] And it will tell you, immediately tell you, whether or not you are living on a day-to-day basis with a recognition of your spiritual poverty, which is the foundation for knowing and walking with God.
[time=3193] Are you ready?
[time=3194] Here's the question, Christian.
[time=3195] Listen, here's the question, one question.
[time=3198] How much do you pray?
[time=3201] I'm not talking about perfunctory ritual prayers
[time=3211] at meal times or bedtime.
[time=3213] Or even at a quiet holy hour where I just by road go through a few things.
[time=3220] When was the last time you fell on your face before God and said, God, I desperately need you today.
[time=3228] I cannot make it through this day.
[time=3229] Lord, I can't run my business without you.
[time=3232] I don't have the wisdom to know what to do.
[time=3234] I'm only living this brief life and it'll soon be passed and Father, only what you accomplish through my life is going to last and so God, I've got to have you, your wisdom, your life, your power, your love, your joy, your patience, God, I need you.
[time=3248] When was the last time as a mother or father you fell on your knees before God and said, oh God, I realize that apart from your intervention I'm going to fail my children as their parent.
[time=3260] I can't be a father that I need to be.
[time=3262] I can't be the mother, I don't have the wisdom, I don't have the love, I don't have the knowledge to know how to raise this child in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
[time=3271] God, I need you, a recognition of your spiritual need.
[time=3276] Now, I'll tell us folks that if we can go
[time=3283] a week or a day or a month or a year without really, really praying, it is a dead ringer indication, we have no sense of our spiritual poverty before God.
[time=3299] The pathway to blessing is the man who recognizes
[time=3307] his desperate need.
[time=3310] So much so that he enters into the second phase of this truth and that's found in verse four.
[time=3316] For Jesus said, blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted.
[time=3324] Now, what does he mean by that?
[time=3326] Well, often we've quoted that verse and said, what that means is when you have a loved one die and you mourn, you're blessed because God comforts you.
[time=3337] Well, that is a marvelous truth and it is true.
[time=3340] God is a comfort to us and he comforts with us, us with a comfort that comes from God alone, but that's not what this verse is talking about.
[time=3349] When you study it, I believe in its context.
[time=3352] Listen, remember these are progressive?
[time=3355] And Jesus is saying, blessed, happy to be envied is the man who recognizes his spiritual poverty, how far short he has fallen of the glory of God, his desperate need of God, he sees himself, he sees his condition, he sees his needs, so much so that he mourns over that condition, that it breaks his heart, that it grieves him,
[time=3381] that the things that bother God begin to bother him in his life, that the things that hurt the heart of God begin to grieve his heart.
[time=3391] Do you know that in the Bible, James chapter four is where it's found that you and I are commanded to mourn?
[time=3400] The Bible says, if you wanna draw near to God, he'll draw near to you, cleanse your hands and your hearts and purify your hearts.
[time=3409] And then it says this, it says, be miserable and mourn and weep, let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into gloom.
[time=3421] What is he saying?
[time=3423] God is saying, when is the time you're going to wake up, America and wake up church and wake up individuals and begin to deal with your life and see your life through my perspective, through my lens, through my eyes?
[time=3437] Those things that you treat so casually, those things, those little sins that you play with in the closet of your life, the little things that you've rationalized and excused away, when are you going to get before me and spend enough time in my presence that you begin to see those things like I see them to say about them, what I say about them so much so that it grieves your heart and you mourn over your sin.
[time=3462] And I wanna tell you something, there is nothing more healthy in this world.
