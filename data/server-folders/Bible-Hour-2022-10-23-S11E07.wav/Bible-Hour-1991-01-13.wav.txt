[time=113] On an October night in 1871, the city of Chicago was hit by a tremendous fire.
[time=118] The fire raged on for 27 hours, devastating everything in its path.
[time=123] Oh, the damage to Chicago was tremendous, thousands and thousands of buildings, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
[time=131] The story goes that the fire was started by a little spark, which ignited a barn, which then spread to another barn and led to the great Chicago fire.
[time=141] James talks about the tongue in that very same way.
[time=144] He says that the tongue can be a spark that starts a great inferno, a great fire, and destroys everything in its path.
[time=153] Come with us this morning as we study from the Book of James, taming the troublesome tongue.
[time=159] [MUSIC]
[time=171] Welcome to our Bible study, Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.

[time=724] [APPLAUSE]
[time=732] Good morning and thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour.
[time=735] Here in Fort Wayne, Indiana in January it's usually very cold on Sunday morning but we give you a very warm welcome as you fellowship with us through the ministry of television.
[time=745] I'd like to welcome to our set today our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson. Good morning Jim.
[time=749] Good morning Pete, it's always fun to be here.
[time=751] Well I'm glad that we have the opportunity to work together on a regular basis not always in a preaching and music situation but even in some of our times we have the opportunity to go visiting in the hospital together and it's neat to be working with you.
[time=765] I was thinking this morning Jim as I opened up the paper that there are a number of our young men and women right in our area who have left even this morning as we talk our leaving for Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
[time=778] I'm just reminded today that we're going to be faithful in praying and I know as you have a pastoral prayer later that you'll be praying for our men and women because it's a very critical time and not only for our men and women but for the President of the United States.
[time=790] Well it certainly is and we need to pray for our President Pete and I was thinking as you were speaking just a second ago I was thinking about those men and women in the Persian Gulf.
[time=798] I'll bet they wish they could sit in a place just like this and worship the Lord this morning.
[time=803] I hope they're having an opportunity to worship him but I'll bet they wish they were home.
[time=807] We're very fortunate to be in this environment but we also need to be very much aware that these young men and women need our prayers in the coming days.
[time=816] Jim I noticed that you're preaching in the book of James. It's a very exciting and very good book also very challenging for the believer and in his personal life.
[time=824] Tell us a little bit about your message this morning.
[time=827] Pete I think we all make New Year's resolutions and I was thinking about New Year's resolutions that Christians can make and I came up with the idea of a New Year's resolution taming that troublesome tongue.
[time=838] No matter how mature we get in the Lord it seems at times we still stumble with our tongue say things that we shouldn't say but James gives us a great challenge in that third chapter.
[time=847] Well it seems that if we contain our tongue everything else tends to follow in place and that's a great place to start in this New Year reminding us that we need to work together to live in harmony in this world
[time=860] and that's one place where we can have a great impact in just controlling the words that we say to our loved ones and to one another.
[time=867] Oh that's for sure. I've been talking about a meeting that's coming up on Thursday evening January 31st here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and that evening we're having a special evening with Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=881] Dr. MacArthur is the pastor of the Grace Community Church in Sun Valley California. He'll be with us that evening as a great author and radio personality.
[time=892] He always challenges me when he speaks and I'm delighted to say that he'll be in the Indiana area right here in Fort Wayne on Thursday evening January 31st at 7 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=906] I hope that you can join us for that evening. It'll be a very good time. We'll also have some fellowship together with those of you that don't normally come to our services but watch the Bible hour and go to other churches.
[time=917] Come and join us for that evening of great encouragement and evening with Dr. John MacArthur Thursday evening January 31st at 7 p.m. I hope to see you there.
[time=928] This week I was talking with Ed Richard, the Bible hour staff and we're talking about things that would help you in encouraging you in your Christian life.
[time=938] One of the things that we have for you today is a file entitled "Every Day with Jesus." It's a booklet that has a scripture verse and then it has a little saying like for this week.
[time=952] It's Jesus, my wonderful Lord and each day you can flip the chart and read a passage of scripture, perhaps put it on your desk or write there ladies where you do the dishes and you can read it every day and be familiar with one of the verses and then flip it for the next day.
[time=969] It has one for every day of the year so we'd like to give this to you if you'll write to us and tell us that you're watching the Bible hour.
[time=976] You can receive this calendar by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=987] Once again that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=998] I want to just take a moment and share with you for instance today's. It's 4 unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called "Wonderful Counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting Father the Prince of Peace from Isaiah" and then the theme for the day is Jesus, my wonderful.
[time=1021] And it says as I realize day by day his exceeding salvation and provision for all my needs clearly his name is wonderful.
[time=1031] I think it'll be a great encouragement as you look forward to every day what scripture is given so I hope you'll write for this today.
[time=1038] We appreciate the fact that you're faithfully watching the Bible hour and I hope it's an encouragement to you.
[time=1043] We'll back to our regular service now as Dave and Debbie play for us and then we have the message from our associate pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=1056] I realize this morning that these two hymns are not in our hymnals so I'd like to read the first verse of both of them if it's alright.
[time=1063] The first hymn is Lord speak to me and the first verse reads Lord speak to me that I may speak in living echoes of thy tone as thou hast sought so let me seek thy children lost in loan, the erring children lost in loan.
[time=1079] The second hymn is his matchless worth and it reads oh could I speak the matchless worth, oh could I sound the glories for which my saviour shine I'd soar and touch the heavenly strings and vibe with Gabriel while he sings in notes almost divine.
[time=1109] [MUSIC - 154 seconds]
[time=1289] Thank you for a successful surgery for Ken Harris. Thank you that a heart valve that had been shredded could be replaced. Thank you that the prognosis is that in a few weeks perhaps he will rise up from that bed of affliction will be healed and will go on with life.
[time=1307] We ask you to comfort today Ben Miller in the loss of a father as he and his wife travel to Wisconsin we ask that you would give them safety that you would be with them.
[time=1318] We ask that you would be with Jim McLean's father as he recovers from surgery on a broken wrist pray that it would be totally successful that the pin would hold everything together that the bone would grow that everything would be successful and the cast would be off in a few short weeks.
[time=1336] We ask for prayer for Juanita Brown we ask that you would continue to give her strength as she lies in a hospital bed today and we would pray for Greg Hindle as he goes back to Riley this week but we would pray more that a donor would be found that the surgery that needs to be done could be done and done soon.
[time=1354] Oh done quickly and we would pray that it would be totally successful. We just lay all of these needs at your feet today knowing that you are the sovereign God of the universe the one who was in control.
[time=1367] Oh again we pray for those of our number that are there in Saudi Arabia and the next day or so as deadlines come we just pray again give them comfort give them encouragement be with their families that are back here in the United States in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1397] [MUSIC]
[time=1402] Be not dismayed when it seems like the storms will never end.
[time=1416] Be not afraid when it seems like you haven't got a friend the storms are raging and you don't have to run in high.
[time=1434] The Lord is faithful to heal the lonely heart inside.
[time=1445] Peace be still, the Father loves you, peace be still, the Father loves you and no matter where you are or where you've been.
[time=1470] I am sure he wants you to know he won't let go.
[time=1484] Be not dismayed when it seems like the hurt will never end.
[time=1496] Be still and no, the Father will never let you go. The pain is raging and you don't have to run in high.
[time=1515] The Lord is faithful to heal the hurting heart inside.
[time=1526] Peace be still, the Father loves you, peace be still, the Father loves you and no matter where you are or where you've been.
[time=1551] I am sure he wants you to know he won't let go.
[time=1559] And no matter where you are or where you've been.
[time=1571] I am sure he wants you to know he won't let go.
[time=1586] He won't let go.
[time=1621] Seven comforting words, peace be still, the Father loves you, no matter what you are going through this very moment in your Christian life.
[time=1631] Or perhaps you're an unbeliever and you're here today and you're going through the travails of life. Peace be still, the Father loves you.
[time=1640] O praise God for his love and for the way that he meets with us in those moments of need.
[time=1646] Well this is the second Sunday of the New Year.
[time=1650] I pray that all of your New Year's resolutions are still intact.
[time=1654] I must admit to you that mine are not. My first New Year's resolution I actually made about five weeks before New Year's.
[time=1662] It was right after the Thanksgiving weekend and after four days of feasting and all that goes on at Thanksgiving time, I got up on a Sunday morning to come to church and realized much to my fear that I couldn't find a suit that fit me any longer.
[time=1678] And I put one on and had a hard time getting it buttoned so I then tried on another one that fits a little bit looser and it was too tight and finally found one that I could wear and although it was uncomfortable I wore it to church that day.
[time=1692] But I remember I made a New Year's resolution. I said by Christmas time, I promise myself I will have a suit that fits me comfortably.
[time=1700] I will have a suit that fits me comfortably by Christmas Sunday. Well that next Monday morning I started off on my diet.
[time=1708] I had I figured about four weeks till Christmas and so I began with all of the discipline and good intentions that all of us have when we start something like that and things went well.
[time=1718] Things went well for a couple of weeks. I didn't think I got off too much but I must have.
[time=1724] Finally about the third week I decided I'd kind of check up on things so I climbed on the scale one morning and I remembered my promise you will have a suit that fits you by Christmas.
[time=1735] Got on the scale, looked at the needle on the scale, got off the scale, got dressed, took my keys, went over to Glenbrook and bought a larger suit.
[time=1744] I did have a suit that fit me for Christmas Sunday. This is the suit that I bought. It fits me. It's getting a little tight already.
[time=1752] New Year's resolutions. Oh they're so important. You know I can tell when I need to lose weight and I suppose that's the most common New Year's resolution but I can tell that when my suits get tight.
[time=1767] Oh there's lots of ways that nature has for reminding us that we need to diet and lose a few pounds now and then.
[time=1774] I was reading a book this week which gave some things that I'd like to relate to you. The subtitle would be you need to go on a diet when.
[time=1782] You need to go on a diet when the man from Prudential offers you group insurance.
[time=1788] Ralph Nader insists that you rotate your shoes every four thousand miles.
[time=1794] You need to go on a diet when you are standing next to your car and you get a ticket for double parking.
[time=1801] And lastly you need to go on a diet when friends start to photograph you with a wide-angle lens.
[time=1808] Well I think New Year's resolutions are good and I try to make them every year and some I keep and some I don't but I think they're good.
[time=1817] I think it's great for all of us to have New Year's resolutions for things like we're going to spend more time with our children.
[time=1824] To make a New Year's resolution that we're going to treat our spouse better. To make a New Year's resolution that we're going to try to be an encourager to others.
[time=1833] Those are good New Year's resolutions that anyone can make.
[time=1837] But I believe that also New Year's resolutions are good in the realm of our Christian life.
[time=1842] I think it's great to make New Year's resolutions that we're going to spend more time in God's Word.
[time=1848] That we're going to spend more time in prayer and meditation with our Lord.
[time=1852] That we're going to spend more time communing with Him.
[time=1856] I think it's good to make New Year's resolutions that we're going to be a better servant that we're going to spend more time serving.
[time=1863] That we're going to have more priorities that are better served toward our Christian life and serving God.
[time=1870] Well I don't know about you. I know that I have some New Year's resolutions and I know that there are lots of things that I can work on.
[time=1877] And perhaps there are things that you can work on. But I think that we all need to make resolutions at times in our life.
[time=1884] And New Year seems to be the time when we all do that.
[time=1887] Well this morning I've titled my message. This year I'm going to tame my troublesome tongue.
[time=1893] For the next three weeks we're going to talk about New Year's resolutions.
[time=1896] This week mine is that I'm going to tame my troublesome tongue.
[time=1900] Have you ever lashed out at your child at the end of a day when you were tired and they came to you perhaps innocently and said something and you just weren't ready and you lashed out and immediately knew you shouldn't have done that?
[time=1912] I have. Have you ever come home from work and had something that your wife said to you that didn't strike you and you lashed out at your spouse for just a moment and instantly realized what you said was wrong and you had to apologize?
[time=1925] Oh I know I have. I think all of us at times have had those times when our tongue is no longer on a leash and it gets away and we instantly regret the thing, instantly regret the things that we say.
[time=1938] Well one man has said that nothing can destroy a six foot man faster than a three inch tongue.
[time=1944] I think that's true. Well I believe James knew that. In the third chapter of the book of James he spoke about the power of the tongue and in verses one through twelve he challenges us.
[time=1956] He challenges us as believers to learn to tame our troublesome tongues. I'd like you to turn with me to James chapter three.
[time=1964] We're going to read those twelve verses. I'm first going to talk about verses one and two as a way of introduction but then thirdly I want us to see three reasons why believers must learn to tame their troublesome tongues.
[time=1980] James gives us three reasons why we must as believers seek to control that small part of our body which can at times get us into so much trouble.
[time=1991] Well let's see what James has to say in beginning with verse one of chapter three. Not many of you should presume to be teachers my brothers because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
[time=2003] We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says he is a perfect man able to keep his whole body in check.
[time=2012] When we put bits into the mouse of horses to make them obey us we can turn the whole animal or take ships as an example.
[time=2019] Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
[time=2028] Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
[time=2038] The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body.
[time=2043] It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell.
[time=2051] All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man but no man can tame the tongue.
[time=2060] It is a restless evil full of deadly poison. With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father and with it we curse men who have been made in God's likeness.
[time=2070] Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers this should not be. Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
[time=2080] My brothers can a fig tree bear olives or a grape vine bear figs neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
[time=2090] Well first by way of introduction James introduces us to this topic of the tongue in verses 1 and 2.
[time=2097] It seems that in the assemblies of those early days of Christianity there were many who wanted to rise up to that position of prominence of being the teacher.
[time=2107] The teacher was held in very high esteem and was held in very high prominence and it seems that there were many who wanted to be the teachers in the assembly.
[time=2117] They aspired toward that position of being the teacher and perhaps James knew that their spiritual maturity was not such that they had proper control of their tongue at that point in their lives.
[time=2130] And so he said to them not many of you should presume to be teachers my brothers and he reminds them that teachers will be judged more strictly than others for the things that they say because they are the ones who preach and teach their words their use of their tongue.
[time=2146] Their tongue will be judged very strictly.
[time=2149] In verse 2 he said we all stumble in many ways but if anyone is never at fault in what he says he is a perfect man able to keep his whole body in check.
[time=2159] Now that word perfect in the new international version actually is translated in scripture in other places as mature.
[time=2166] It doesn't mean sinless or perfect in the way of sinless perfection but it means mature as in full grown or reaching full potential.
[time=2177] The idea is that of a person who has reached full maturity and is able to control their tongue and James is saying when a person reaches that level of maturity that they can tame their tongue then more than likely they have the rest of their body in check
[time=2195] because the tongue is the most difficult of all things to control.
[time=2201] Well with that introduction he then goes into verses 3 through 12 and gives us these three reasons why we must learn to tame our troublesome tongues.
[time=2211] The first one is found in verses 3 through 5 and that is the power of the tongue.
[time=2216] Let's first look at verses 3 through the first part of verse 5 and we'll see James tells us about the power of the tongue.
[time=2225] James says the tongue is powerful and then he gives us two illustrations of the power of the tongue which would have both been readily understandable to his audience.
[time=2235] Notice in verse 3 he gives two illustrations.
[time=2238] He says when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us or we can turn the whole animal or take ships as an example.
[time=2247] Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
[time=2256] James has chosen two illustrations to explain the idea of the tongue being so small and yet so powerful.
[time=2265] He uses first of all the imagery of a horse.
[time=2268] Now the horse that James was speaking about was the type that would have been used for military purposes.
[time=2274] Using a horse in the area of agriculture was not common at that time in the world that James would have written about.
[time=2280] But the idea was that of a military horse, a big horse, a proud prancing horse, one with a strong spirit, that of a stallion or a strong mare.
[time=2291] And James is saying the horse is strong, that horse is powerful, but that big horse can be controlled by a little piece of metal called a bit which when you put into its mouth the rider of the horse can steer it and can direct it.
[time=2308] And a small little bit can control the horse.
[time=2313] He then uses the example of a ship which would have been the largest inanimate object of the day that any man or woman could have ever hoped to control.
[time=2322] And he says the ships of the sea as they go about are buffeted by the wind and the waves.
[time=2328] But a man or a woman can be at the control of a small little piece of that ship and by holding on to that piece of the ship they can steer that ship through the troubled waters they can control the large ship.
[time=2342] It's called a rudder.
[time=2344] James was saying in both cases that the smallest part of the ship or a small little bit into the mouth of a large horse could give man the power to control it.
[time=2357] Now what's he saying?
[time=2359] Well he's drawing an illustration there of the tongue and he is saying that just as the bit and the rudder are tiny objects in relation to the large objects that they control.
[time=2368] So the tongue of us as human beings, so the tongue is a very small object which exercises control far outstripping its size, far outstripping its size in the area in comparison to the rest of our body.
[time=2385] He is saying even though it's such a small part of our body, it exercises such power, such strong control.
[time=2394] Think about that for a moment, the tongue is powerful.
[time=2397] Just a few words can have a tremendous impact upon someone else.
[time=2402] We can walk up to a little child who I pray that we never would.
[time=2407] But someone could walk up to a young child and say "I hate you" and they could destroy that little child.
[time=2414] Destroy that child's self-esteem, strike them down with the verbal cutting of the tongue.
[time=2421] Yet they could turn to that same child and say instead "I love you" and build up in that child a positive self-esteem and a love and a good self-image that will carry that child through life.
[time=2435] Just a few words can make such a big difference. The tongue is powerful. Peter was giving a sermon shortly after Pentecost and he spoke.
[time=2448] But really a few words and yet it says that 3,000 came to believe and were baptized and joined into the membership of the early church.
[time=2456] Just a few words. Jesus was sitting at the well one day and a lady walked by and Jesus shared a few words with her but her life was forever changed by the words of the Savior.
[time=2467] And not just that but she went back to her village and she told the people in her village about this man and what he had said to her and they came and they heard and they praised him and their lives were changed.
[time=2479] Oh James is showing us. The tongue is powerful. It can do great good. It can do great evil but the tongue is powerful.
[time=2490] Just a couple of weeks ago we were traveling toward our home to my mother's home in Toledo for Christmas and as we were traveling we stopped just before we left to go on Route 24 and got each of our boys age 9 and 4 a pack of gum.
[time=2504] One of those large packs with about 20 sticks in it we figured that would keep them busy on that 2 hour journey to Toledo.
[time=2511] Well as we were traveling we were probably half an hour into our ride and by that time Kyle our 4 year old had about 10 sticks in his mouth and was holding about 10 sticks in the pack in his hand.
[time=2522] And Linda and I were speaking in the front seat as we traveled talking about Christmas and we heard Kyle say mom and Linda turned him and said Kyle just a moment.
[time=2531] I'm speaking with your father about 10 seconds later he said again mom mom so she turned around and she said Kyle what is it?
[time=2539] He was holding his pack of gum in his hand and we saw this wad of gum in his mouth and he said mom what should I do with my gum?
[time=2546] Linda looked at him and said put it in your pocket.
[time=2551] Well we went on down Route 24 and about 30 seconds later Drew we hear Drew our 9 year old go oh yuck.
[time=2559] Mom look at Kyle and we turned and he had gum on his face and his hands and his beautiful new pants that we got him for Christmas.
[time=2568] He had gum everywhere and as we turned to say something to him we both realized at the same moment he had only done exactly as we had told him to do.
[time=2577] What should I do with my gum? Put it in your pocket and he had taken it from his mouth put it in his pocket and it was everywhere.
[time=2585] Just a few short words how powerful they were.
[time=2590] An afternoon of taking gum out of hair and cutting out pieces and then trying to take gum out of brand new pants.
[time=2597] Words are powerful we must be so careful with what we say.
[time=2602] Well this morning James is teaching us that words are powerful.
[time=2607] Words are powerful and he is telling us that as believers we must learn to tame our tongue and to keep our tongues under control because the words that we speak from the small part of our body have such power to affect our lives and the lives of others.
[time=2623] Oh he was saying our words are powerful. If you're here today perhaps you're a believer and you're here today.
[time=2633] Are you struggling with your tongue? Do you like me at times have those times when you say to yourself I know I shouldn't have said that.
[time=2640] Oh I know we all do that from time to time but perhaps there's someone here today who's struggling with that troublesome tongue.
[time=2648] Oh if you're a believer there's power there's power to control that tongue.
[time=2653] We'll talk about it in a few moments but there's power through the Holy Spirit to tame that troublesome tongue.
[time=2659] Perhaps you're an unbeliever here today perhaps your words have gotten you at odds with somebody in your family perhaps with a neighbor perhaps with somebody at school.
[time=2669] The Bible teaches that you can come to Jesus Christ you can trust in him and have forgiveness of all those sins have everlasting life but in a practical sense you can also learn and give him your tongue and he can help you to learn to control through the power of his Holy Spirit.
[time=2686] Oh James gives us some practical advice but let's move on in verses 5 the second part of 5 through verse 8 I want to speak secondly about the fact that of the perversity of the tongue.
[time=2698] The tongue is not only powerful but the tongue is perverse.
[time=2703] James will tell us here that the tongue very powerful but also has great potential for evil and can be also very infectious and destructive.
[time=2714] Verse 5b and then on to verse 8 he says consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
[time=2722] The tongue also is a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body it corrupts the whole person sets the whole course of his life on fire and itself set on fire by hell.
[time=2737] James gives us here a series of clauses which deal with the evilness of the tongue.
[time=2742] I'd just like to read through some of those clauses highlight them for you and then illustrate a little bit as to what Jesus or I should say James is telling us this morning about our tongue.
[time=2752] First he said consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark the tongue also is a fire. What did he mean by that?
[time=2763] Well on October 8 of 1871 supposedly in a barn on the west side of Chicago owned by a lady by the name of O'Leary.
[time=2773] A dairy cow kicked over a lantern the kerosene lantern let out a spark which ignited some straw which ignited a barn.
[time=2783] And when the barn was ignited the fire spread to the barn next to it and then to the barn next to it and then to a block and then for the next 27 hours a tremendous blaze ravaged the city of Chicago.
[time=2795] The Chicago fire department could not get it under control and after 27 hours when they finally did the destruction in the city of Chicago was horrendous.
[time=2806] Over 13,000 buildings had been destroyed possibly as much as 400 million dollars in damage had occurred between 250 and 300 people had lost their lives in that great blaze.
[time=2822] A tremendous blaze tremendous destructive fire how did it begin it began with just a little spark.
[time=2832] James is telling us that just as a spark can create a fire which does great damage so the tongue can be the spark which starts a great fire and does great damage.
[time=2847] The tongue is capable of tremendous destructive evil it can set brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor, country against country it can set the world on fire by the words of world leaders.
[time=2861] The tongue is small but it's powerful but then notice he goes on he said is that it is a world of evil among the parts of the body.
[time=2871] What James was saying there it is as if all of the evil of the world were embodied in this tongue.
[time=2877] It was as if all that is evil in this world is inside of this tongue in the human body that can do so much damage.
[time=2886] And then he goes on to say that it corrupts the whole person it sets the whole course of his life on fire.
[time=2895] Actually James here is referring to a corrupt heart he's referring to the mind which communicates to the tongue and then the tongue communicates that evil but he is saying that it corrupts the whole person.
[time=2908] He said it sets the whole course the whole course of his life on fire.
[time=2915] What does that mean?
[time=2916] I believe that James was saying there that the tongue is a fuse which ignites the life of a person.
[time=2924] The tongue is a fuse which ignites a fire in the life of a person that can cause great destruction both of a person himself or to those around him or perhaps to an entire community.
[time=2937] As that tongue ignites in a person evil that person can do tremendous damage by his words that person can do tremendous damage to those around him to an even to a community or as we know today sometimes to an entire part of the world.
[time=2956] The tongue is a spark it ignites it ignites a person tucked away in the annals of American history as a minuscule little event that took place called birth conspiracy.
[time=2969] If you studied American history perhaps you've heard of it but there was a man in our country's early history by the name of Aaron Burr.
[time=2976] Aaron Burr was a young man who had tremendous exploits in his life both for good and for evil.
[time=2983] At one point of his life he was elected vice president of the United States, almost defeated Thomas Jefferson for the presidency, served as Jefferson's vice president in those early days.
[time=2993] But Aaron Burr was a tremendously charismatic orator, he was the one who could stir people, he could ignite people, energize people with his tongue.
[time=3003] With the words that flowed from his tongue he could win people to his side, he could sway people with his wonderful power.
[time=3010] He was the fuse which ignited people to follow him.
[time=3014] We don't know exactly what it was but we do know that something called birth conspiracy occurred.
[time=3022] Aaron Burr bought a tremendous tract of land out in the western area of our country, a tremendous land and began hiring soldiers to help him occupy that territory.
[time=3033] Some of the soldiers he got were men in that region, early settlers, some were men who left the American army.
[time=3040] But Aaron Burr was doing something and to this day we don't really know what it was, probably one of two things.
[time=3048] He was probably building up an army in that area so he could secede from the union, make himself the leader since he had failed to become the leader in the United States.
[time=3057] Others thought perhaps he was going to conquer a portion of Mexico with that army and make himself a ruler in that part of the world.
[time=3065] Well the word got back to Thomas Jefferson that Aaron Burr was involved in this conspiracy and Jefferson had him arrested and brought to trial.
[time=3074] Well they couldn't prove that Aaron Burr's exploits were treasonous, they couldn't prove that anything that he had done was punishable by death and so he was found innocent on the charge of treason.
[time=3087] But some of his followers were not quite so lucky.
[time=3090] There was a young man who had followed Aaron Burr who had been ignited by Burr's tongue. His name was Philip Nolan.
[time=3097] Philip Nolan was a promising Navy lieutenant, a young man on his way up, a man who was headed for the top of the military ranks of the day.
[time=3106] But Philip Nolan had been swayed by Aaron Burr's or rhetorical ability in persuasiveness.
[time=3113] When he came to trial he was asked if he would repent of what he had done.
[time=3118] He was asked if he was sorry for the crime that perhaps he had committed or would commit against the United States.
[time=3124] He was young, he was cocky and he was not repentant that day in court.
[time=3129] Finally the military tribunal said you are a disgrace to the United States of America.
[time=3134] And Philip Nolan looked at the judge and said I wish I would never hear of the United States of America ever again.
[time=3142] He was found guilty and that was his sentence.
[time=3147] Philip Nolan was put on various naval vessels of the American Navy for the rest of his life.
[time=3153] And for the rest of his life he sailed all over the world on American naval vessels never again seeing the United States of America again.
[time=3162] In fact he was never even allowed to hear in company anyone speak of the United States of America.
[time=3171] All because he was ignited by the inflammatory speech of a man named Aaron Burr.
[time=3180] A life destroyed.
[time=3183] James is saying that the tongue is a fuse which ignites.
[time=3187] It can destroy us or the lives around us.
[time=3190] Tremendously powerful in the way that it can commit evil.
[time=3194] And then he goes on to say that the tongue is energized by hell itself.
[time=3200] He goes on in verse 7 and 8 to say no man can tame the tongue.
[time=3205] Oh James is right. No man can tame the tongue.
[time=3209] But there's good news.
[time=3211] The Bible teaches that there is a way of taming that troublesome tongue.
[time=3216] If we will turn to Jesus Christ and allow him to work through us.
[time=3220] How do we do it? Let's look at a couple of verses first and then we'll discuss it in a more practical way.
[time=3226] Romans chapter 8, Romans chapter 8 gives us in verse 13 a way that we can control our troublesome tongues.
[time=3237] Romans chapter 8 and verse 13.
[time=3240] Paul writes, "For if you live according to the sinful nature you will die.
[time=3246] But if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live.
[time=3253] Because those who are led by the spirit of God are sons of God." Before we comment on that let's turn to Galatians chapter 5.
[time=3263] Galatians chapter 5 and let's look at that same verse or another set of verses that talk about the same idea.
[time=3270] Galatians chapter 5 verses 16 and 17.
[time=3280] As I say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
[time=3285] For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the spirit and the spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature.
[time=3292] They are in conflict with each other so that you do not do what you want.
[time=3296] But if you are led by the spirit you are not under the law.
[time=3300] What was Paul saying there? Paul was saying that all of us as believers have a power at our fingertips.
[time=3307] A power to overcome our troublesome tongues and other areas that are evil in our lives.
[time=3314] Paul was saying that there is a ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3318] We call it the filling of the Spirit. It's different from the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3322] It's the filling of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3325] And we're taught in Scripture that when we come to Christ and when we actively seek to yield to the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[time=3333] When we surrender ourselves to the Holy Spirit daily.
[time=3337] That the Holy Spirit fills us with his power and allows us to be more Christ like and more godly in our daily walk with him.
[time=3347] It teaches us that we can become mature. We can grow in Christ.
[time=3352] And as we grow in Christ the Holy Spirit speaks to us about the areas of our lives that we need to deal with.
[time=3359] And one of those is dealing with the tongue.
[time=3362] Yes, through the filling power of the Holy Spirit we can live under the Spirit filled control of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3371] Oh, I need that as a believer.
[time=3373] And that's an ongoing thing. I need to do that and to surrender to Jesus Christ daily.
[time=3378] I need to surrender to him and to his way and ask for the power of his Holy Spirit daily in my life.
[time=3384] And as I yield to him the Bible teaches I will have more and more power of the Spirit in my life.
[time=3392] Oh, if you're here today and you're not a believer, that's the first step to come to Christ to trust in him.
[time=3398] And then to take out on this great adventure called the Christian Life where you can have the power of the Holy Spirit filling you today.
[time=3406] Might be the time when you finally take that step to trust in Christ as your Savior to come and let him give you everlasting life.
[time=3413] And fill you with the power of his Holy Spirit.
[time=3418] And then thirdly and lastly this morning as we go through these final verses I'd like us to look at the inconsistency of the tongue.
[time=3427] The inconsistency of the tongue and this is found in verses 9 through 12.
[time=3433] James goes on with this tongue we praise our Lord and Father and with it we curse men who have been made in God's likeness.
[time=3440] Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing my brothers this should not be.
[time=3445] Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
[time=3449] My brothers can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine bear figs.
[time=3454] Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
[time=3457] James is telling us that the tongue of a man or woman can be very inconsistent.
[time=3463] He is telling us that with the same tongue we come to church and we praise God.
[time=3468] I believe that we can take this verse and in a 20th century setting he is saying that we come to church on Sunday morning and we praise God.
[time=3476] We worship him we sing his praises we pray to him all we go through all of those wonderful parts of our worship service and we praise God we listen to him.
[time=3488] All were blessed by that and that's so important but James says but then we do something that's not consistent.
[time=3497] He says that at the same time that we do that then we we leave and we go out and we curse men.
[time=3513] It's been our privilege today to share with you inspirational music from our sanctuary choir Susan Stump Dave and Debbie Johnson and Kevin Roll.
[time=3522] The message today was from our associate pastor Jim Pearson certainly an encouragement to control our tongue.
[time=3529] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you before we close.
[time=3539] Dear Heavenly Father I'm so thankful that I can come to you today and I could ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3547] I ask you to come into my heart and be my Savior today as the Bible promises you will do and give me eternal life.
[time=3555] In Jesus name I pray Amen.
[time=3559] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision and when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
