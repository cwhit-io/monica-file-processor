[time=150] A man lived his life as an avowed atheist. When he died, his friends rode upon his tombstone, here lies an atheist, all dressed up and no place to go. But the Bible teaches that that just isn't so. It is appointed unto all men once to die, and then comes the judgment.
[time=176] The only way to avoid the fires of judgment is to receive Christ as our Savior in this life. All dressed up and no place to go. I'm sure many an atheist who have died now wish that that were so.
[time=190] Welcome to the Bible Hour. We're glad you've joined us. Our speaker today is Associate Pastor Jim Pearson. Jim's message is entitled "Sharing Your Faith." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Matthew, chapter 13.
[time=219] We will be looking at verses 47 through 52. Special music includes a solo from Marilyn Wong, a song from Rejoice, and a solo from Denise Mitchell.
[time=235] We now join our service with a song from the Sanctuary Choir entitled "Heal Our Land."
[time=265] If my people will humble themselves, humble themselves and pray,
[time=284] if they seek my praise and humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways,
[time=296] I will hear from heaven, and for yield their sin. I will hear from heaven, and yield their land.
[time=315] I will hear from heaven, and yield their land.
[time=357] For we now are ye, we humble ourselves, humble ourselves and pray.
[time=368] For we seek your face, we humble ourselves, and turn from our wicked ways.
[time=380] Father in no mercy, for give our sin.
[time=390] Father in no mercy, for give our land, for give our land.
[time=404] Father in no mercy, for give our land.
[time=411] Hear from heaven, and turn our nation back to you.
[time=420] For give our land, hear our soul, Lord, and yield our land.
[time=430] For give our sin, and yield our throne, and land.
[time=440] For give our land, Father, yield our land.
[time=452] Give our throne, and turn our nation back to you.
[time=462] For give our land, hear our soul, Lord, and yield our land.
[time=472] For give our sin, and yield our throne, and land.
[time=490] Hear our pride, and yield our throne, and land.
[time=506] And we cry, O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come.
[time=516] That's the theme of the next hymn that we'll sing together, hymn number 52.
[time=520] We'll sing verses 1, 2, 3, and 6 of hymn number 52.
[time=546] Our shelter from the stormy west, and our return no more.
[time=557] O, dear Master of all thy throne, thy saints and thoughts in you.
[time=567] Salvation is our hope, and our repentance is true.
[time=578] Give our land, give our lives, and give our lives to the brave.
[time=588] Amen, O, dear Master, sing over one, and last days we'll sing.
[time=599] O, dear Lord, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come.
[time=609] Be all our part, our hearts are lost, we're all made for all.
[time=621] Thank you for your good singing and participation in this aspect of our worship hour.
[time=626] Continue with music now as Marilyn Wong comes to sing for us.
[time=630] And you listen to the words, she reminds us that things change very quickly in our world, and that is true in this last week, and yet God never changes, he remains the same.
[time=640] Let's listen as she sings.
[time=657] Come and see the works of God, awesome to the sons of men, for the greatness of his power.
[time=667] Let us all rejoice in him, he will rule by might forever.
[time=673] He keeps watch on all the lands, bless the Lord with all your being.
[time=679] Raise your voices, clap your hands.
[time=685] Shout joyfully to God, sing the glory of his name.
[time=691] Shout his praises evermore, he alone will now exchange, sing the glory, sing the glory of his name.
[time=714] And hear what God has done, healing body, mind and soul,
[time=720] who the working of his power, making us completely whole.
[time=726] Certainly he hears us pray, come Lord Jesus, quickly come, all the earth will worship you,
[time=735] and sing your praise almighty one.
[time=742] Shout joyfully to God, sing the glory of his name.
[time=748] Shout his praises evermore, he alone will never change, sing the glory, sing the glory, sing the glory of his.
[time=765] Shout joyfully to God, sing the glory of his name.
[time=771] Shout his praises evermore, he alone will never change, sing the glory, sing the glory, sing the glory, sing the glory of his.
[time=787] Shout joyfully to God, sing the glory of his name.
[time=793] Shout his praises evermore, he alone will never change, sing the glory, sing the glory, sing the glory of his name.
[time=817] Good morning and again thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour.
[time=823] I know that all of you have been watching the television very intently in this last week, listening for additional information concerning the war in the Middle East.
[time=832] Jim, this last week has been a very, very critical time in the life and history of the United States.
[time=838] The first time we've been in war really peaked since the Vietnam War, and it has been a critical time, and I'm just sure that it seems like every American has had their eyes and their ears glued to their televisions and radios ever since this broke out.
[time=850] I've been interested that there's been so much publicity about the children since they're totally unaware, in many cases, about the distance between the Middle East and even the United States, and I think the media has done quite a good job, and I know that many of the schools have been very intent in explaining to the children what's going on,
[time=869] and I hope that's alleviated their fears just a little bit.
[time=872] I hope so. I saw Mr. Rogers being interviewed on national TV, talking to parents about how to help their kids cope with this time.
[time=880] Jim, we have three or four people that are in the Middle East, fellas that are affiliated with our church,
[time=887] and we certainly want to be praying with everyone that God will lead in this war and that will protect our men and women that are fighting for our country.
[time=896] Jim, last week, we talked about a New Year's resolution. That was a very tough one and one that we could all relate to on taming the tongue.
[time=904] You have another New Year's resolution for today. Tell us about it.
[time=909] Well, this week, Pete, we're going to preach on this year. I'm going to share my faith boldly.
[time=914] You know, if judgment is true and we know it is, then we need to be sharing our faith boldly with as many as we can to draw them into the kingdom before that time of judgment comes.
[time=924] Jim, even that's very appropriate as we've seen so many people go to prayer for our nation and our men and women who are fighting.
[time=933] We need to be doing that all the time, but that's very appropriate for right now to share what we believe in and know that Jesus is a savior for all the world and not just for a few people.
[time=943] I'm glad you're speaking on that, and we're looking forward to it in just a few minutes.
[time=947] Well, I'm looking forward to the chance to deliver it.
[time=949] Great. We've been telling you about a special program. This will be the last time that we can announce it on January 31st.
[time=957] That's a Thursday evening. We will be hosting Dr. John MacArthur here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=963] Dr. MacArthur is the pastor of the Panorama City Grace Community Church and is an author and radio speaker.
[time=972] In fact, he speaks right here in every day at WFCV radio station. It's an AM station here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=979] He'll be here with us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church worship center on Thursday, January 31st at 7 p.m.
[time=987] I know that's going to be a very exciting time, and Dr. MacArthur is a marvelous speaker.
[time=992] My brother happens to go to his church, and every time we visit in California, we look forward to the time that we have to go worship at Grace Community Church.
[time=1001] Grace Community Church there in Sun Valley, California. A marvelous speaker, one that will encourage you, speaks from the heart.
[time=1008] It's very knowledgeable, and I hope that you'll take the time to come and join with us.
[time=1013] We'd also love to see some of our Bible hour viewers that go to your regular church, but perhaps would have an evening free that could come and greet us.
[time=1021] Come that evening, January 31st, 7 p.m. That's Thursday night.
[time=1026] Also, just before we go back to our live portion of the program, last week we showed you and introduced to you a new flip card calendar.
[time=1036] I have it in my hand. It's all thoughts about the Lord Jesus Christ, one for every day.
[time=1042] There's a verse, and then there's a little analyzation about the verse for every day.
[time=1047] You can put this on your, right on your calendar, ladies, and some bin while you're washing dishes, and men put it on your desk.
[time=1055] And every day, just flip the calendar over one, read the portion of Scripture and the theme that is there for every day of the month.
[time=1063] I hope that you'll write for it today. You can receive it just absolutely free by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1076] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1085] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our broadcast, listening to Rejoice, our ladies ensemble sing, and then our message from our associate pastor, Jim Pearson.
[time=1097] Thank you for the opportunity of being here today to worship you in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1114] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[time=1142] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[time=1229] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[time=1244] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1250] Father, that truth this morning is so real that we can be happy, happy, whatever the circumstances of life might be.
[time=1259] You have told us in your word that you are our refuge, you are our strength, that we can come and hide in you from the travails, the trials of life.
[time=1268] We come to you this morning. We stand on those promises because we know that they are true.
[time=1274] We pray for those from our church that are stationed in the Persian Gulf and perhaps even engaged in warfare at this very moment.
[time=1281] We pray and beseech you that you would surround them with a wall of protection, that you would protect them and bring them home to us.
[time=1289] I pray that you would give all believers that are stationed there in our armed forces, men and women alike, the boldness to share their faith with others around them, to lead others to you even during this time.
[time=1302] I pray for Scott Popwell as he is there today, for Rick Snyder, for Tom Snodgrass.
[time=1308] I pray for Tony and Betty Woods as their son is stationed there.
[time=1312] Oh, lives in our church have been touched by this war.
[time=1315] I pray for them.
[time=1316] I pray that you would give strength and comfort to those that sit by TV sets and radios and listen to the reports.
[time=1323] Oh, and I pray for some that have not heard good news.
[time=1327] We pray for even here back at home for the needs that we have.
[time=1332] Thank you that Albert Powell could be home.
[time=1335] I thank you that Ken Harris could be conscious and be able to communicate.
[time=1340] Father, we rejoice within our church this week in the births of two children to the Norris family, to the Gaffer family.
[time=1348] We rejoice with them.
[time=1349] We thank you for the gift of life.
[time=1352] We pray that you would help those parents to raise them up in a Christian believing home.
[time=1358] We come now, ask once again that you would give wisdom and guidance to President Bush as commander in chief as he guides our country through this time.
[time=1367] Give him an extra measure of your wisdom as he seeks to make decisions in the days ahead.
[time=1372] But most of all, Father, we pray that they would be home soon, that our sons and daughters would be home soon back with us in the United States back at peace.
[time=1381] In Christ's name, amen.
[time=1411] [MUSIC]
[time=1450] If we'll come to the fountain, the Lord will make us home.
[time=1461] So today I'll be just who I am, with hopes of who I'll be, for you are.
[time=1472] I'll ever fool is me.
[time=1478] Lord, help us to be the people we should be.
[time=1488] Don't let us hide, our sorrows in a smile.
[time=1497] Put your hand upon our hearts and take away our fears.
[time=1506] Don't let us know and hide when love draws me.
[time=1516] Today will die tomorrow, and this world will fade away.
[time=1525] This life is not forever, so I'm waiting for the day.
[time=1535] The end I will die by light, the night will then be done.
[time=1543] I'll smile at you as if to see.
[time=1548] You love me all the way you've got for me, and now it's time.
[time=1561] Lord, help us to be the people we should be.
[time=1569] Don't let us hide, our sorrows in a smile.
[time=1578] Put your hand upon our hearts and take away our fears.
[time=1587] Don't let us run and hide when love draws me.
[time=1609] And hide when love draws me.
[time=1631] Don't let us run when love draws near.
[time=1634] If you're here this morning, love is drawing near.
[time=1637] If you've never trusted in Christ as your Savior and as your Lord, love is drawing near today.
[time=1643] Take him at his love and trust in his Son.
[time=1647] Oh, if you're a believer here today, love is drawing near.
[time=1650] If you're going through the trials, the tribulations of life, the weight of the world has gotten you down.
[time=1656] His love is drawing near.
[time=1658] His love is there.
[time=1659] There's a strength.
[time=1660] There's a power for living, a power for life in his love.
[time=1665] It's drawing near today.
[time=1668] Well, we are in the second week of a series which I have entitled New Year's Resolutions.
[time=1674] Last week in the first message I spoke about taming that troublesome tongue, I told you that I had made that a New Year's resolution, and that I want to, as much as I can, led by the Spirit of God to control my troublesome tongue, to learn how to control it in the daily events of life.
[time=1694] Well, this morning, if you notice, I have titled our message.
[time=1697] This year, I am going to share my faith boldly.
[time=1701] Perhaps at no other time in our history has it been more important for us as believers to share our faith boldly, to give out our witness of Jesus Christ to all, to all to hear that they might, too, draw near to his love and trust in him.
[time=1718] If you have a Bible with you this morning, I'd like you to turn to Matthew, chapter 13.
[time=1724] Matthew, chapter 13, and in a few moments we'll be reading, verses 47 to 52.
[time=1731] Matthew, chapter 13, and verses 47 to 52.
[time=1736] Father, thank you again for the music today.
[time=1739] Thank you for the fact that we can worship you.
[time=1742] Oh, we would pray as I open the word now that you would give me wisdom.
[time=1746] I pray that the message would be clear that ears and hearts would hear in Christ's name.
[time=1751] [AMEN] It was May of 1980.
[time=1756] The volcano known as Mount St. Helens was preparing to erupt.
[time=1761] Geologists were intently looking at their seismographs.
[time=1765] They could feel the earth tremors under their feet.
[time=1768] They didn't know for sure just when, but they knew one thing for sure.
[time=1773] Mount St. Helens was about to blow.
[time=1776] They began to tell the local authorities that danger was near.
[time=1780] Policemen drove around telling all of the tourists that they needed to flee to safety as soon as possible.
[time=1786] They were giving a warning.
[time=1788] Mount St. Helens is going to blow.
[time=1790] No one will be safe, flee the area immediately.
[time=1795] Well, the radio and television announcers picked up on that and they continually repeated the message that had been given to them by the scientists.
[time=1803] We don't know just when, but scientists are predicting the eminent eruption of Mount St. Helens.
[time=1811] Clear the area as quickly as you can.
[time=1814] Forest rangers went into the various national parks and searched for hikers and campers who had not heard the word to warn them to flee from the coming danger.
[time=1824] Oh, by the end of that first day, there was an endless stream of cars and campers traveling away from that area of Washington, D.C.
[time=1834] Well, there was one man who refused to leave.
[time=1837] One man who said, "I'm not leaving." Oddly enough, he had the same name as one of our former presidents.
[time=1845] His name was Harry Truman.
[time=1848] Harry Truman was kind of a crusty old guy, likable, but a little testy, and he said, "I'm not leaving."
[time=1854] He lived about five miles from the crest of the volcano, and he said, "I'm going to stay right here."
[time=1861] He had a home.
[time=1862] It was nothing great, but well, it was comfortable, and it was home to him and his 15 cats.
[time=1868] And Harry said, "I'm not leaving." Well, the police came and they pleaded with Harry.
[time=1874] They said, "Harry, we want you to go.
[time=1876] You need to flee to safety." Harry said, "No, I'm going to stay here." Later, his sister would come, and she would beg him to leave, but Harry said, "No, I'm going to stay here.
[time=1887] I'm not going to leave this home." I know more about Mount St. Helens than anyone, and Mount St. Helens isn't going to blow up on old Harry Truman.
[time=1898] Well, on the morning of May 18th of 1980, Harry Truman got up that day, as usual, probably fed his 15 cats,
[time=1907] and then made his breakfast of bacon and eggs as he always did.
[time=1913] Then after that, he began his morning chores.
[time=1916] But at 831 in the morning of May 18th, Mount St. Helens erupted with a ferocious amount of power.
[time=1924] The concussive waves from the eruption leveled everything within 150 mile radius of that volcano.
[time=1932] Harry Truman, his home and he and his cats were buried under 50 feet of molten lava and rock and mud.
[time=1942] The story of Harry Truman and Mount St. Helens illustrates well the important point that Jesus is making in our text today.
[time=1953] For Jesus, too, is sounding a warning.
[time=1957] In our text this morning, Jesus is saying, "Judgment is coming.
[time=1962] Judgment is coming." He doesn't say exactly when that will be, but there can be no doubt that one day judgment will come.
[time=1973] Old Harry Truman, well, he was kind of like the Pharisees of Jesus' day.
[time=1978] He heard the warning, but he refused to believe.
[time=1981] He didn't think it would blow on Old Harry Truman, but it did.
[time=1985] Unfortunately, Harry lost his life on Mount St. Helens.
[time=1990] Oh, the Pharisees, they didn't heed the warning.
[time=1993] They didn't heed the warning, and Jesus eventually turned from them because they wouldn't embrace the offer of salvation that he offered to them.
[time=2002] You know, in a way, the story of Harry Truman illustrates much of mankind today.
[time=2008] Here in America and across and around the world, the message is proclaimed from pulpits all over the world.
[time=2016] Judgment is coming, but people refuse to heed the warning.
[time=2024] Oh, Jesus in our text this morning is sounding the warning clear.
[time=2028] If you're a believer here this morning, I believe that this text should be a challenge to you, a challenge to share your faith more boldly in 1991.
[time=2038] A challenge that this year, if this text be true and we know that it is, then we need to be sharing our faith with as many who will hear,
[time=2047] drawing as many into the kingdom of God as we can, that as many might believe before judgment comes.
[time=2055] Perhaps you're here today and you've never trusted in Jesus Christ.
[time=2059] This text is also a motivating factor for you.
[time=2062] It should motivate you to come to give your heart and your life to Jesus Christ that you might have everlasting life and flee from the wrath of judgment that Jesus says is to come.
[time=2076] Well, let's look at this passage this morning and as we look at this passage on judgment, I would like us to see four aspects of our Lord's explanation of the judgment that is to come.
[time=2087] Four aspects of our Lord's explanation of this judgment that he says will surely come, beginning with verse 47 in Matthew chapter 13.
[time=2098] Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
[time=2106] When it was full, the fisherman pulled it up on the shore.
[time=2109] Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets but threw the bat away.
[time=2115] This is how it will be at the end of the age.
[time=2118] The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[time=2126] Have you understood all these things Jesus asked?
[time=2130] Yes, they replied.
[time=2131] He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."
[time=2144] Jesus here begins with a parable to speak to us about the judgment that he says is coming.
[time=2152] The first point that I would like to make this morning is found in verses 47 and 48 and I've called it the picture presented.
[time=2160] Jesus spoke to the disciples and to the Pharisees in a parable.
[time=2165] A parable is a word picture which Jesus used to illustrate a biblical truth.
[time=2171] Jesus knew that creating a picture in someone's mind would help them to understand the concept that he was teaching.
[time=2178] And so Jesus often taught in parables and here he does and he presents a picture of the judgment that he says is coming.
[time=2188] I believe it was no accident that he chose fishing to describe the judgment that was coming.
[time=2194] Jesus knew that many of the disciples were former fishermen.
[time=2198] They would understand what he was saying.
[time=2200] He knew that many of the people there would have relatives who were fishermen if they were not fishermen themselves.
[time=2206] He also knew that the Pharisees, if they weren't fishermen and probably were not, lived near the sea of Galilee and would be familiar with the fishing that went on every day on that great sea.
[time=2218] Well Jesus chose fishing. He speaks about something called a drag net.
[time=2223] But in order to understand what Jesus meant we must first look at the various types of fishing that were done in our Lord's day.
[time=2231] The first one was a very simple line and hook, catching one fish at a time.
[time=2236] This is the type of fishing that you and I might do.
[time=2239] It was the type of fishing that Peter did when Christ told him to go and catch a fish, take from it the drachma,
[time=2245] and then go and pay the tax that Jesus knew they owed to Caesar.
[time=2249] Well that was one type of fishing. Another one was what was done when you had a casting net.
[time=2255] A fisherman would carry what was called a casting net upon his shoulder, and he would walk out into the water and he would look for a school of fish.
[time=2263] Now this net was weighted down and it had a cord on it, and so when he saw a school of fish he would throw the net down upon the school of fish,
[time=2271] trap them with the weights against the bottom of the lake, and then he would pull on the string and it would tie the net and draw it tight like a duffle bag.
[time=2280] And he would take his catch then and carry it into shore.
[time=2284] But the net that Jesus is speaking about here is something that we would call a drag net.
[time=2290] The drag net was much, much larger.
[time=2293] The drag net could be as large as one half of a square mile.
[time=2297] It was a tremendous net.
[time=2299] It took many, many people, many hours to deploy it properly to bring in the catch of the day.
[time=2306] The large net had weights on the bottom and floats on the top and it would be stretched out between two fishing boats and they would stretch it way out and then they would deploy the net and it would cover the entire area from the surface to the bottom.
[time=2321] The thing about the drag net was nothing escaped.
[time=2326] Everything that came in contact with it became a part of the catch.
[time=2331] Well eventually when it was full the men would drag it onto shore and it would take hours to drag it up onto the shore.
[time=2338] And then they would open up the drag net and they would sit down and they would go through and throw out the wood and they would throw out the weeds until they came to the fish.
[time=2346] And then they would separate the desirable, the good fish from the bad fish.
[time=2352] The good fish they would put into buckets and take them to market.
[time=2355] The bad fish they would just reject or throw away.
[time=2359] Well I think it's pretty obvious.
[time=2361] Jesus is giving us a general picture of judgment.
[time=2365] He is speaking about a time when the drag net of judgment will catch all of the fish and the good ones will go on to everlasting life.
[time=2373] And as he calls it here the evil or undesirable ones will be rejected for all eternity.
[time=2379] Well we'll see more detail concerning this as we go through the passage but I'd like to make two general comments from this picture that Jesus gave us.
[time=2389] First of all no one will escape the judgment.
[time=2393] The Bible is very clear that the net would catch everything that it came in contact with and the net of judgment too will catch everyone.
[time=2403] The Bible says that every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and will stand before him.
[time=2411] No one will escape the judgment.
[time=2414] A second thing that I see in this passage is that now is the time of salvation.
[time=2420] Now is the time of salvation.
[time=2423] Jesus says here that the judgment day is coming and it will come.
[time=2429] He doesn't tell us when. He merely says it's coming.
[time=2434] We also know from scripture that the only way to avoid the wrath that is to come is in this life to trust in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.
[time=2444] And so if you're here today and you've never trusted in him, judgment is coming.
[time=2449] We don't know when and because we don't know when now is the time of salvation.
[time=2455] Now is the time.
[time=2458] You know one aspect of witnessing then those of you that have been involved in sharing your faith have run into this but one of the things that is amazing to me are the amount of people who believe so much of what we believe but refuse to accept the idea that judgment is coming.
[time=2474] You will share your faith with them and they'll say yes I believe in Jesus Christ.
[time=2478] They may even say I believe that he was the Son of God. They may even go on to say I believe that he died for my sins but when it comes to making a commitment to Jesus Christ they will delay.
[time=2490] They will put it off. They will say no I'm not ready to do that and they will risk being caught in the judgment day that is to come.
[time=2499] I remember one night in our family room at home my oldest son has a tremendous baseball card collection and he had all of his baseball cards spread out all over the family room and he was just kind of rolling around picking up the baseball cards looking at him looking in the magazines
[time=2514] to see how much the cards were worth and he was charting everything just a tremendous time of looking at this hobby of his all of his baseball cards.
[time=2522] I remember about 830 saying to him Andrew now you're going to be in bed at nine o'clock it's just about time for you to start picking up your baseball cards getting down the hallway and getting ready for bed.
[time=2533] You will be in bed at nine o'clock. He said yeah dad no problem I know that rolled over went back to his baseball cards and forgot all about what I had said to him.
[time=2542] Well it got to be about quarter till and I talked to him again with a little more of a tone in my voice and I said to him Andrew it's quarter to nine.
[time=2551] It's time for you to pick up your baseball cards put them away it's time to get ready for bed.
[time=2556] You will be in bed at nine o'clock. I know dad I know rolled over started looking at his baseball cards totally forgot what I had told him.
[time=2565] You know what's interesting he was totally oblivious of the judgment that was about to come.
[time=2573] About three minutes to nine I said to him again Andrew Andrew put your baseball cards get to bed put those baseball cards away get down the hallway and get to bed you are going to be in bed by nine o'clock.
[time=2585] Now my son has a little bit of the statesman or politician in him and he looked at me right away and he said you know dad I was just getting ready to do that but thank you for reminding me went off down the hallway and went off to bed.
[time=2598] He didn't receive judgment that night he received mercy he made it by the skin of his teeth.
[time=2603] But you know many put off the fact they don't believe judgment is coming or they don't believe the Bible teaches now is the time of salvation.
[time=2616] We know not when that time will come and only when we receive Christ in this life will we escape.
[time=2622] Judgment was coming now is the time have you trusted in Christ today have you trusted in Christ and come to him repent of your sins ask him into your heart that you might have everlasting life.
[time=2635] Jesus says judgment is coming well first we have the picture presented but as we move on we have the principal explained Jesus now goes from the general picture and explains a little more of what is happening.
[time=2649] In verses 47 and 48 Jesus presented a picture of the judgment that was to come and now in verse 49 he begins his interpretation.
[time=2658] I call it the principle explained because the principle that is being taught here is that of the separation of the good from the evil and now Jesus will explain in more detail what will happen when that judgment time comes.
[time=2674] Notice verse 49 he says this this is how it will be at the end of the age.
[time=2681] Now what age was he speaking of there he was speaking of what we call the church age it's the age which we are living in now.
[time=2689] In the time in which we live now in the church age God in his love is desiring that as many as possible come to him and trust in his son for salvation.
[time=2700] God is allowing both evil and righteousness to exist in this world at the same time today.
[time=2707] Oh he is allowing unrighteousness to go on he is allowing of course righteousness to go on but he is patiently giving opportunity for those who need to come to him to come and giving opportunity for us as believers to share our faith.
[time=2724] We live in the church age but in this verse Jesus is teaching that that age will one day come to an end.
[time=2731] God's toleration of sin and unrighteousness will come to an end and when it does I believe the first thing that will happen is that we will have the judgment that he has been speaking about here the judgment of the righteous and the unrighteous.
[time=2746] The judgment whereby the righteous will go on to everlasting life the judgment where the unrighteous will perish in eternity separated from him.
[time=2756] Now Jesus is not giving us a detailed description of the last days here.
[time=2761] He is merely concentrating on the judgment of unbelievers and I believe that in mind here in view is the great white throne judgment of Revelation chapter 20.
[time=2771] In Revelation chapter 20 we have described to us by John this judgment as people come before our Lord Jesus Christ in judgment.
[time=2781] Revelation chapter 20 verse 11 says this.
[time=2786] Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.
[time=2792] Earth and sky fled from his presence and there was no place for them and I saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and the books were opened.
[time=2802] Another book was opened which is the book of life.
[time=2805] The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
[time=2809] The sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them and each person was judged according to what he had done.
[time=2818] Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2822] The lake of fire is the second death.
[time=2825] If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2832] John there gives us a horrible picture of the judgment day.
[time=2838] He gives us a horrible picture of the great white throne judgment when the drag net will be opened up.
[time=2844] The drag net will be opened and the good fish will be separated from the ones that he called the bad fish.
[time=2851] Oh that's a scary sobering thought but the Bible teaches that it's true.
[time=2857] Now when you preach a message like this you often get the question asked of you, how could God do that?
[time=2863] How could a loving God send somebody to an eternity in a place called hell?
[time=2869] I thought God was a loving God.
[time=2871] Well first of all God doesn't send someone to hell.
[time=2874] They send themselves by their rejection of the love of his son but second of all he is a loving God
[time=2881] and he has shown us that he is a loving God all through the pages of Scripture from the beginning to the end.
[time=2888] Scripture teaches that God looked down upon mankind, saw him fallen and deep in sin, saw him lost
[time=2895] and yet he sent his son, his only beloved son to live a life, to go to the cross shed his innocent blood on Calvary
[time=2904] that we might have everlasting life.
[time=2907] Oh I believe God suffered that day as he watched his son die in agonizing tortuous death on Calvary.
[time=2915] God did that because he loved us, he wanted us to have everlasting life.
[time=2921] Oh God is a loving God.
[time=2923] The Bible says in Ezekiel God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked.
[time=2929] In 2 Peter he says God does not desire that any should perish.
[time=2935] And then he goes on to say that in Luke chapter 19 our Lord looking out over Jerusalem and seeing that they refused
[time=2942] to come to him sat down and wept over the city of Jerusalem because he loved them and was hurt
[time=2952] and was agonizing over the fact that they refused to come to him.
[time=2958] Oh God loves us, God loves us, but you know that same God that is a God of love is also a holy and a just God
[time=2967] and he cannot accept sin, sin must be punished.
[time=2971] Sin must be punished but the great news is that through the shed blood of his son Jesus Christ, God is provided a way of salvation.
[time=2979] God has provided a refuge from the fires of judgment that are coming.
[time=2985] In the early days of our country as the pioneers went across the plains they had to worry about many things
[time=2992] but one of the things was that of the rapidly spreading grass fires that would hit.
[time=2997] A grass fire as it would feed upon the grass of the prairie and would move rapidly across the plain
[time=3003] could even move faster than a horse could run away from it.
[time=3006] And so it became an all consuming fire and it would feed upon the grass and grow and grow and grow.
[time=3013] When the settlers would be crossing the plains area and they would hear that the grass fire was coming.
[time=3019] The settlers would take and they would burn a very large area of grass out.
[time=3024] And once that area of grass was burned out they knew that that would be their refuge and they would move all of their goods into that area and as the fire would come they would be safe.
[time=3035] For as the fire would come it would be looking for grass to feed upon and as it came to this burnout area it would go around the settlers and move on and find the grass that it might consume.
[time=3046] Well they had a refuge from the fire.
[time=3050] We too have a refuge from the fires of judgment.
[time=3054] It's called the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary.
[time=3059] There's no other refuge.
[time=3061] William Cowper wrote the song, "There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Immanuel's veins
[time=3068] and sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains." There is only one way to lose the stains of sin in our life and to know that we have everlasting life
[time=3079] and that's through the blood, the shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=3083] The principle explained and then as we move on to verse 50 we have the punishment revealed.
[time=3090] The punishment revealed in verse 50.
[time=3095] And throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[time=3103] The punishment revealed in verse 50.
[time=3106] The last thing that we want to do today is to manipulate anyone's emotions.
[time=3112] The last thing that we want to do today is to attempt to scare someone into an emotional decision because of something that might be said from the pulpit today.
[time=3121] No, that's not what we're seeking to do.
[time=3124] But I want to say that the Bible is very clear and all we are doing today is proclaiming the counsel of God that says that one day there will be a judgment and for those who are rejected, for those who have not trusted in Christ, there will be an eternity spent and the punishment will be a fiery furnace
[time=3144] where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, where those who don't receive Christ will suffer in a place called hell.
[time=3154] There was a preacher of another era by the name of Charles Finney.
[time=3158] He had a classic sermon.
[time=3159] It was called Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.
[time=3162] He spoke about the horrible picture that was painted in Scripture of eternity separated from God and the torture of that condemnation.
[time=3173] Well, the Bible leaves no doubt as to the existence of hell.
[time=3177] Let's look at a few verses and we can see that it's definitely a part of Scripture and definitely is a place.
[time=3184] Matthew 5, chapter 22, Jesus said,
[time=3190] "Anyone who says to his brother, 'You fool' is in danger of the fire of hell."
[time=3199] Just a few verses in that same chapter, Matthew 5, verse 29.
[time=3204] He said, "If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out, and throw it away, it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." And then staying in Matthew, in Matthew 23.
[time=3222] Matthew chapter 23 and verse 33, Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees
[time=3229] and he said this, "You snakes.
[time=3234] You brood of vipers.
[time=3235] How will you escape being condemned?
[time=3237] To where?
[time=3238] Condemned to hell." Perhaps the most poignant one was pointed out to me yesterday.
[time=3245] I had read it before, but it became a new to me and is perhaps the best one to speak about the reality of hell.
[time=3252] It's found in Luke chapter 12 and verse 4.
[time=3257] Luke chapter 12 and verse 4.
[time=3266] Jesus said, "I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that can do no more." Verse 5, "But I will show you whom you should fear.
[time=3276] Fear him who after the killing of the body has power to throw you into hell."
[time=3283] Luke chapter 12 verses 4 and 5.
[time=3287] Hell is real.
[time=3289] Now what will hell be like?
[time=3291] Well we don't know exactly, but I think there are some things we can draw from Scripture that can give us a pretty poignant picture.
[time=3297] Number one, hell will only be a place of punishment.
[time=3301] There will be no fun in hell.
[time=3304] It is always laid out in Scripture as a place of eternal separation from God and a place of eternal punishment.
[time=3312] Secondly, we know that it will be a place of torment.
[time=3316] Mark chapter 9 verse 43 says that hell is like a fire that can never go out,
[time=3322] a fire that cannot be extinguished.
[time=3326] Perhaps you've never thought of the fact that hell will also be torment for both
[time=3332] the body and the soul.
[time=3335] Scripture teaches that when an unbeliever dies, when someone dies who is not trusted in Christ, their soul immediately goes into eternal separation from God, into eternal punishment.
[time=3346] But the Bible also teaches that on resurrection day as the body and soul are reunited, that body will join that soul in everlasting punishment and the body and the soul will burn forever in a place called hell.
[time=3361] Lastly, it's eternal.
[time=3364] It's never ending.
[time=3366] Well, that's not a pretty picture.
[time=3369] You know, it's a picture of a horrible time for all eternity.
[time=3373] For those who refuse to believe and refuse to accept the love of Jesus Christ.
[time=3382] C.S. Lewis was a great theologian and writer of another era.
[time=3386] And C.S. Lewis had as his personal secretary a man by the name of Hooper.
[time=3390] And they were traveling through a graveyard in England one day and they were looking at the gravestones and Hooper, his secretary, began to laugh.
[time=3398] C.S. Lewis wasn't sure what he was laughing at.
[time=3401] And so he went up and looked at the gravestone.
[time=3403] But C.S. Lewis didn't laugh.
[time=3405] He looked at the gravestone and it read, "Here lies an atheist.
[time=3411] All dressed up and no place to go." And C.S. Lewis looked at Hooper and he said, "I'll bet this atheist now wishes that were so."
[time=3424] You see, hell is real.
[time=3426] And the only way of escape is through Jesus Christ.
[time=3429] Now, perhaps you're here to this morning and you're saying to me, "Well, Jim, okay, I believe in hell it's taught in Scripture, but I'm not going to go to hell.
[time=3437] I'm not evil like some of the people that are mentioned in Scripture.
[time=3440] I never reviled Christ.
[time=3442] I never attacked him.
[time=3443] I don't say evil things about Christians." Well, the Bible says that that's not the criterion that Jesus uses.
[time=3451] The Bible says all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[time=3455] It says that all are in need of a Savior.
[time=3459] And so the challenge is made again to trust in Christ.
[time=3463] But let me speak to all of us here for a few moments that are believers this morning.
[time=3468] Oh, this is a sobering passage.
[time=3470] And the title of this message today is, "This year I'm going to share my faith boldly."
[time=3476] I'd like to ask the question.
[time=3478] Can we read passages of Scripture like this?
[time=3481] Walk out of a service today and not feel motivated to share our faith.
[time=3486] Oh, I pray that you would be driven to share your faith to bring as many into the kingdom as we can
[time=3492] before that judgment day comes that Christ is speaking about.
[time=3496] Yes, the punishment is revealed.
[time=3499] And then lastly this morning I want us to see the proclamation commanded.
[time=3504] The proclamation commanded of us is found in verses 51 and 52.
[time=3510] Jesus said, "Have you understood all these things?" Yes, they replied.
[time=3514] He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."
[time=3525] Jesus looked at the disciples and he said, "Have you understood these things?" What was he saying?
[time=3533] He was saying, "Have you understood what I've just told you?
[time=3536] Have you understood?
[time=3537] Judgment day is coming, and I'm giving it to you to spread to all of those who need to hear the word of God.
[time=3545] I'm giving it to you." They replied, "Yes, we understand." Oh, they didn't understand perfectly, but they understood.
[time=3553] Now you may be asking, "Well, Jim, where from this passage do you get this command to proclaim the word?"
[time=3559] It's found in verses 52.
[time=3561] I'm glad that we could share with you today the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir,
[time=3571] rejoice, and soloist Denise Mitchell and Marilyn Wong.
[time=3575] The message today was part two in a three-part series of messages from our associate pastor, Jim Pearson.
[time=3582] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer before we close.
[time=3591] Dear Heavenly Father, this week I've sent the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3597] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3603] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3607] If you prayed that prayer, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3611] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3620] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the daily flip calendar entitled "Every Day with Jesus,"
