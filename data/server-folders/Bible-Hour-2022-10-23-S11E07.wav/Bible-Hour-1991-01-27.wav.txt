[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=90] He looked deeply troubled.
[time=91] He said, "Pastor, you've got to pray for me.
[time=94] "You see, when I was making $200 a week, "I was able to cheerfully and generously give "to the Lord's work.
[time=100] "But now I've prospered.
[time=101] "I now make $2,000 a week, "and I find that I'm so caught up "in the things of this world, "I just can't give like I used to." The pastor said, "I'll pray for you." He bowed his head and said, "Dear Lord, "please reduce this man's salary to $200 a week "so he can get back into your will." A prayer by a pastor, perhaps a bit extreme.
[time=122] But the Bible says that we are to be cheerful and generous givers.
[time=126] Come with us this morning as we study the words of the Apostle Paul about being a cheerful and generous giver to the Lord's work.
[time=134] (dramatic music)
[time=148] - Welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=150] Thank you for joining us.
[time=152] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=155] Jim's message is taken from the book of 1 Corinthians, chapter nine, verses six through 11, and is entitled, "A Cheerful Giver." Special music today includes a selection from the Handbell Choir and a solo from Reed LeFavor.
[time=172] Let's join our service with a song from the Sanctuary Choir, entitled, "Almighty God." (gentle music)
[time=206] [MUSIC - 181 seconds]
[time=393] - He purchased my forever.
[time=402] What a glorious phrase in that song, meaning that Jesus Christ gave us eternal life through His Son.
[time=409] Let's continue as we sing the mighty power of God, singing together, hymn number 59.
[time=414] Hymn number 59, we'll sing all three verses.
[time=418] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=537] - We thank the Lord that we can sing of His almighty power.
[time=545] And yet as we look at the scriptures, we can see how much He cares for us.
[time=549] The handbell choir is going to play a song that's entitled Shepherd of Love.
[time=553] It's number 446 in your hymnal.
[time=555] If you'd like to just kind of listen and follow the words, I hope that you'll be blessed and by the great message in this song.
[time=562] (gentle music)
[time=768] - Good morning and thank you for tuning into the Bible Hour today.
[time=771] For the last two weeks, our Associate Pastor Jim Pearson has been speaking.
[time=775] He'll conclude his series of messages on New Year's resolutions today.
[time=780] I hope that you'll stay tuned for his message in just a few minutes.
[time=783] Today with me, I have a special guest who's a member of our church and is involved in music events around the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=791] I'd like to introduce to you Wade Holbrook.
[time=792] Good morning Wade.
[time=793] - Good morning Pete.
[time=794] - You've been a member of our church and you've been active with the local Christian bookstore here for a number of years.
[time=800] And now you've just formed recently a new company called Pure Heart Ministries.
[time=804] Tell us just a little bit about the purpose of Pure Heart Ministries.
[time=807] - Well Pure Heart Ministries is a not-for-profit Christian events company that my wife Katie and I formed to put on events here in the Fort Wayne area to promote Christ using music.
[time=816] And one of the events we have coming up fairly quickly is our Sing for Joy talent showcase that'll be hosted right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=823] - We've had some other events, but I want you to tell us specifically about the Sing for Joy showcase that's coming up.
[time=829] - Okay, this is our third Sing for Joy.
[time=831] And this year we have a talent showcase that will be going on on Saturday, February the 16th that'll feature some of the outstanding Christian vocalists around the Fort Wayne area and around the entire state of Indiana.
[time=842] During the day we will have people from Nashville from around the country in here to critique these singers.
[time=849] And as they are sharing their talents they will be being scored and having their comments written.
[time=854] And then the top scores during the showcase will appear in a public concert that evening that'll be hosted by Dick and Melody Tunney who are very well known Christian writers, performers, lecturers from Nashville, Tennessee.
[time=866] And Dick and Melody will host the evening concert which is open to the public.
[time=870] It's a $2 ticketed event and the tickets can be purchased through Fort Wayne area Christian bookstores or by contacting Pure Heart Ministries.
[time=877] - I believe this is the third year for this showcase and we've heard some really great singers and I'm sure this year will be no exception.
[time=885] Can you tell us that date again in the time of the actual evening concert that Saturday evening in February?
[time=890] - The Saturday evening, February the 16th, 7 p.m.
[time=893] is when the concert will start.
[time=894] The doors will open at 6.15 p.m. that evening.
[time=897] And yes, we have had some outstanding talent.
[time=899] When I put this together my idea was to let all the Christian vocalists in the area hear what the good soloist from other churches sound like and had no idea how good the talent was.
[time=910] Last year we had a male and female duet, Kirk and Janet Hughes that went on from Sing for Joy out to Estes Park, Colorado to a national Christian vocal talent showcase and they took second place in a national contest out there.
[time=921] We had a ladies trio that took fifth place in that same national contest and we even had a local family, the white family that got signed to a recording contract last year.
[time=929] So there's a lot of good talent here and the evening concert should be an excellent good enjoyable evening of Christian music for people.
[time=935] - It just occurred to me Wade that our soloist this morning, Reed LeFavor was involved in the contest last year and I believe he won first place in the male vocal contest.
[time=943] So that is an exciting time and if you're watching today and you would like more information, it'll be up on the screen.
[time=950] You can call Wade Holbrook and Pure Heart Ministries and find out more information.
[time=954] We've been talking to you for a number of weeks already about fresh moments.
[time=960] That's a new devotional magazine that has come out through the Bible hour and I hope as a Founders Club member you receive that and you've begun to use it on a daily basis.
[time=970] It's a wonderful short devotional that you can read every day, it doesn't take very much of your time, has some scripture, has some thoughts about that scripture and I've just really been encouraged with fresh moments and I hope that you just don't set it aside but you'll pick it up and read it faithfully every day.
[time=987] It'll be a good encouragement to your devotional study each day and then for your office or for the kitchen area near your sink, we have a flip card calendar that we want to talk to you about today.
[time=1001] This is our gift offer for this month.
[time=1003] This will be the last time that we'll be offering this.
[time=1006] It's called Every Day with Jesus and there's a scripture verse and then there's just a little title concerning Jesus.
[time=1014] You would read the scripture.
[time=1015] In fact, this Sunday is for the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost and then it says, Jesus my rescuer and then finally down the darkest quarters of time, Jesus comes to retrieve my soul from the land of the destroyer.
[time=1032] Just a little encouragement each day as you walk into that specific spot either to your office or to the kitchen or put it on your dresser so that as you get up in the morning, you can just turn to that.
[time=1043] You can read a verse of scripture very quickly and just get the main thought of it.
[time=1048] I hope that you'll write for this calendar today.
[time=1051] You can receive it absolutely free by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1062] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1071] Well, Wade, we're excited about the ministry of Pure Heart Ministries and the Sing for Joy contest.
[time=1077] Dick and Melanie Tunney, our friends of ours, not only will they be here for the concert and the contest but they'll join with us on Sunday morning, February 17th right here at the Blackhawk worship center and also will be on the Bible hour.
[time=1091] So I hope that you'll take those dates and set them aside and join with us.
[time=1095] We're glad that you've tuned in today and I hope that you will remain with us as Jim Pearson speaks to us.
[time=1100] Let's go back now to the live portion of our program as Read La Favor sings for us.
[time=1106] (soft music)
[time=1117] [MUSIC - 256 seconds]
[time=1374] - On January 16th, war broke out in the Middle East.
[time=1392] As hope for peace faded, Congress authorized President Bush to lead the United States into battle.
[time=1398] The President said, "There are times in life when we confront values worth fighting for.
[time=1404] This is one such time." Today we support those men and women serving in the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm.
[time=1413] We are especially concerned about our friends and relatives.
[time=1431] (silence)
[time=1461] Father, we come to you today on behalf of all of those that are there in the Persian Gulf today.
[time=1469] The men and women of America serving so proudly and valiantly in Operation Desert Storm.
[time=1475] This morning on the news, it spoke of three Marines who were killed in a car accident, not even necessarily related to a skirmish.
[time=1485] We would pray that you would comfort their families.
[time=1488] Pray that they would not feel that their lives were lost in vain.
[time=1491] They were serving their country proudly.
[time=1494] We would pray for this insidious oil spill that's growing in the Persian Gulf and for all of the damage that it could do.
[time=1501] We pray for direction and guidance for our President as he goes through this time as Commander-in-Chief.
[time=1509] Most of all we would pray for each and every one of our young men and women serving there so bravely that you would bring them home soon.
[time=1517] We would pray for success.
[time=1518] We would pray for your will, but we would pray that you would bring our young people home very, very soon.
[time=1524] Father, we praise you this morning for several things.
[time=1529] We praise you that John Verstblatt could be feeling better and for the first time saying, "I feel like getting involved again and getting busy in the Lord's work." Praise you for the fact that Rhonda Huzer is much improved after surgery.
[time=1543] Praise you perhaps most of all today for three souls that came into the kingdom this week as a part of an outreach ministry of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1553] We would come to you this morning and ask for your healing touch upon Fred Gaskell as he lays in a hospital bed today.
[time=1561] We would also pray for your healing touch upon Ken Harris as he fights this time, recovering from heart surgery.
[time=1569] We again pray for direction for our President, for all those serving in the government that you would give them direction and wisdom and dealing with this war that we are in.
[time=1578] Most of all, we would pray again that our young people would be home soon in Christ's name.
[time=1584] [AMEN] Well, this morning we are going to look at our third and last as far as our Sunday morning studies, New Year's resolutions for 1991.
[time=1597] We have been studying various New Year's resolutions, which if we will heed and make a part of our lives, I believe the Bible teaches will make us more effective serving Christians as we seek to serve Jesus Christ.
[time=1611] This morning we're studying the topic of this year, I resolved to be a cheerful giver.
[time=1618] Now perhaps someone is sitting there and you're saying to yourself, well now Jim, I didn't mind it a couple of weeks ago when you told me I needed to watch my mouth.
[time=1625] And I didn't mind it last week when you told me I needed to share my faith.
[time=1628] But when you start talking about money, now you've kind of quit preaching and gone to meddling and I'm not too happy with that.
[time=1635] Oh, I pray that's not the case, but the Bible teaches that we are to be cheerful and generous givers in the Lord's work.
[time=1643] So this morning, let's look at this third resolution.
[time=1646] If you have a Bible with you, I'd like you to turn with me to the ninth chapter of the Book of Second Corinthians.
[time=1653] The ninth chapter of the Book of Second Corinthians as Paul gives us perhaps the most comprehensive passage in all of the New Testament in dealing with proper Christian giving.
[time=1665] The second book of First Second Book of Corinthians chapter nine verses six through 11.
[time=1672] Let's pray again and ask the Father to bless our time together.
[time=1676] Father, thank you so much for your word.
[time=1678] We pray again for wisdom.
[time=1680] Just pray that you would make the message clear today in Christ's name, amen.
[time=1686] The story goes that a farmer some time back had a champion cow.
[time=1691] It was a prize-winning cow and he was really proud of that animal.
[time=1696] One morning he came running into his house and he told his wife, you won't believe it, but our cow has given birth to two of the most beautiful calves you will ever see.
[time=1705] There's a brown one and there's a white one.
[time=1708] They're beautiful.
[time=1709] I think we ought to raise them to be champions.
[time=1712] And you know, I think that we ought to show our appreciation to the Lord.
[time=1716] So he told his wife, this is what we'll do.
[time=1719] We'll raise them as champions.
[time=1720] And when they're mature, we'll sell them.
[time=1723] The proceeds that we get from the sale of one of our cows, one of the calves we will give to ourselves.
[time=1730] We'll use it for our personal financial dealings.
[time=1733] We'll use it to help to support ourselves.
[time=1736] But the other calf, when it's full grown, we'll sell it and we'll use that money to give to the Lord's work.
[time=1743] We'll show our appreciation to the Lord for the way that he's blessed us by selling that calf and giving the entire proceeds to the Lord.
[time=1752] Well, the lady looked at her husband and she said, "Well, which one are you going to dedicate to the Lord's work?" He said, "Oh, that's not important right now.
[time=1759] We'll worry about that at a later time." And he went out the back door.
[time=1764] Well, a couple of weeks later, he came in looking rather dejected and forelorn.
[time=1769] He looked downright terrible like he had just lost his best friend.
[time=1773] Was wife said to him, "Honey, what's wrong?
[time=1775] What possibly could have happened?" He said, "Honey, you wouldn't realize it.
[time=1779] The worst thing that could happen has happened." The Lord's calf died.
[time=1784] You know, the man in that story illustrates very well what Paul is teaching us in our passage today from the book of 2 Corinthians.
[time=1794] For Paul is teaching that we are always to give of our best to the Lord's work.
[time=1798] That we are always to be a cheerful and generous giver as we seek to return the blessings unto the Lord that He has bestowed upon us.
[time=1809] Now, unlike the farmer, Paul is saying that you and I are to be cheerful and generous givers.
[time=1816] Paul was writing in this passage to the Corinthian church.
[time=1820] The Jerusalem church was in dire straits.
[time=1823] It was a terrible time for them and economically oppressed time in their history and they needed some relief.
[time=1830] Paul had written to the Macedonian Christians and they had taken up a collection and they had taken up a generous collection to give to relieve the Jerusalem church of the oppressive times in which they lived.
[time=1842] And Paul in our passage is reminding the Corinthians that they too had agreed, they too had agreed to take up a collection and to give a generous gift but they hadn't done it.
[time=1853] And now Paul writes to them, to remind them, but as he writes these verses of scripture, he also reminds us of our duty as believers in this New Testament time of grace in which we live our responsibility for giving liberally, generously and cheerfully to the Lord's work.
[time=1875] Well, let's read this passage now and as we do, I would like to point out three important truths concerning proper biblical giving.
[time=1883] Three important truths that Paul gives us in this passage concerning proper biblical giving.
[time=1891] Paul begins in verse six.
[time=1893] Remember this.
[time=1894] Whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever so's generously will also reap generously.
[time=1902] Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=1911] And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work as it is written, he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor, his righteousness endures forever.
[time=1928] Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
[time=1938] You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
[time=1948] Oh, Paul begins this great passage by giving us a principle and that's my first truth this morning.
[time=1955] That is the principle presented.
[time=1957] In verse six, Paul presents a principle that he says is to be our guide for New Testament Christian giving.
[time=1966] Just as he wrote to the Corinthians and reminded them, he says to us today from the pages of scripture, the following words in verse six.
[time=1975] Remember this.
[time=1976] He is saying mark this, don't miss it.
[time=1979] This is important.
[time=1980] Whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever so generously will also reap generously.
[time=1989] Paul is giving the Corinthians a critical principle of the Christian life.
[time=1994] It's a principle that operates in various aspects of our lives but nowhere is it more important and more true than in the principle of Christian giving.
[time=2005] Paul uses the imagery of a farmer to explain the principle of sowing and reaping.
[time=2012] And he begins by telling them in verse six that just as a farmer scatters his seed, just as a farmer plows up the land and then scatters the seed and then some months down the road harvests a tremendous crop.
[time=2027] He is saying to them, that's the way it is for us as believers in the area of Christian giving.
[time=2034] You know what he is saying there is that all things being equal, all things being equal, the more ground that a farmer plows, the more seed that he plants, the larger his harvest will be months later when the time comes for the harvest.
[time=2049] You know using farming as imagery was something that would be very, very familiar to the people in Paul's day.
[time=2057] Agriculture was a major part of the economy.
[time=2060] The farmers knew that there were three things that you did when you harvested your crop.
[time=2065] A portion of your crop you would take and you would hold it back for food for your family.
[time=2070] You would seek to put away enough of the crop to feed your family in the months ahead.
[time=2075] Then you took a second portion of your crop and you sold it for profit.
[time=2079] You would take the profits from the sale of that portion of your crop and you would use it to finance your family's lifestyle during that time.
[time=2087] The third portion of the crop, you would protect, you would hold back and you would use it as seed to plant your harvest for the following season.
[time=2097] And those farmers knew that if they held too much back for food, if they sold too much in any one season for profit, then that would limit the amount of seed that they would have to plant and that would reduce the size of their harvest the following season.
[time=2114] And so Paul is making it very clear to them in the area of farming, you sow and then you reap.
[time=2121] And he is telling us in the area of Christian giving that as we sow our seed of giving, we reap a harvest in the future that's abundant.
[time=2132] The more we give, the more we will harvest.
[time=2135] Now sowing and reaping is a basic principle of life.
[time=2138] Again, all things being equal, it operates throughout our lives as we go through our lives here upon this earth.
[time=2145] It works in the area of investing.
[time=2148] If we are an industrious person and we save our money regularly during our lifetime, if we put it away into some type of an investment vehicle, I believe that it's a basic truth that we will reap interest, we will reap dividends and benefits from that investing.
[time=2164] We sow our money in a bank account and we receive the interest as a harvest at a later time.
[time=2170] Oh, it's the same as we go about our careers.
[time=2173] Of course, there are economic recessions and things that come that we can't help.
[time=2177] But if we will work hard and if we will seek to get along with our coworkers, if we will seek to do a good job and we will sow that effort into our careers, hopefully we will gain, by way of advancement, we will be considered to be a good employee, we will reap a harvest as our coworkers and our bosses will respect us.
[time=2198] It's true in friendships that we have.
[time=2200] In order to reap a harvest of friendship with other people, we must be willing to sow into their lives our efforts at becoming their friend.
[time=2209] And if we do that in a generous way, someday we will reap the harvest of those friendships.
[time=2215] Well, Paul is talking about a basic principle of sowing and reaping.
[time=2220] But the context here is definitely giving.
[time=2223] Paul is talking about the importance of giving to the Lord's work and he is telling us here that giving is a God-directed investment whose returns are in proportion to what is given.
[time=2237] Just as a farmer sows his seed, so also the Christian sows his riches that are giving to him by God and invests them in the Lord's work and he says that the harvest will be commensurate with the sowing.
[time=2250] Now, what is the harvest here in this verse?
[time=2253] What's he talking about?
[time=2254] Well, we'll go into more detail in a few minutes as we move on to a different verse.
[time=2258] But it's safe to say that the harvest here is the reaping of the harvest of souls that are one to the Lord Jesus Christ through the work of the New Testament church.
[time=2268] And so Paul is saying that we give our finances, we give our cheerful portion to the Lord's work wherever we may be plugged into a local ministry.
[time=2278] And then that ministry is winning souls and there will be a harvest reaped because we have all given in proportion to the way that the Lord has blessed us.
[time=2288] Sowing and reaping.
[time=2290] Well, I remember my second year of seminary, this law coming true to me, this principle.
[time=2296] I remember going to Hebrew grammar class the second semester.
[time=2300] First semester hadn't been too bad.
[time=2302] Memorize some Hebrew terms and you could sit in class or you could sit while someone else was preaching and you could flip through your vocabulary cards and you could learn your Hebrew without a tremendous amount of effort.
[time=2312] But in the second semester, boy, it all came down quickly.
[time=2315] They threw in all kinds of different verb stems and rules and all kinds of things.
[time=2320] Before I knew it, I went to class on a Friday and I was totally lost.
[time=2324] My professor was teaching and I had no idea what he was talking about.
[time=2328] Well, I remember driving home and going out to dinner that night with Linda and I said to her, Linda, something's got to give here.
[time=2334] I am really falling behind in Hebrew and if I don't spend at least two more hours a day studying Hebrew, I don't think I'm gonna make it through.
[time=2342] I'm gonna have to do it.
[time=2344] Well, we worked out a way that I could do that, get up earlier, go to bed later, whatever it would take.
[time=2349] We would spend that time, I would spend that time studying the Hebrew lessons for that week.
[time=2355] Well, I remember going to class, working hard and for the next 13 or 14 weeks, it was a tremendous amount of effort that I put into that course.
[time=2363] I had a friend of mine who was struggling along with me.
[time=2366] His name was Neil.
[time=2367] Neil was from the island of Hawaii.
[time=2369] And I remember telling Neil, when you go back to Hawaii, if you ever get your own church, please invite me outcome any time to speak at your church on a Sunday morning.
[time=2378] But I remember Neil and I struggling together and working hard and sewing the seed of effort into our course, then finals week came.
[time=2386] And it was the time of judgment.
[time=2389] We went into class and sat down and my professor who I dearly loved, Dr. George Zemic passed out our Hebrew exam.
[time=2397] We sat down and I began to translate and do all the things I needed to do.
[time=2401] Well, I remember looking at the verses and I had memorized a lot of Old Testament verses as I worked on my translation, but he was crafty.
[time=2408] He had changed the verses around a little bit and he had taken a little of this verse and a little of that verse and kind of put a little here and a little there.
[time=2415] You had to be able to translate every single Hebrew word.
[time=2417] You'd never do it from memory from studying just Old Testament passages.
[time=2422] Well, I remember sitting there and doing the best I could and feeling like I had done fairly well, like I was fairly well prepared and I walked up to him at the end and I passed in my exam and I said, "Dr. Zemic, "this is Friday and I'm not gonna be back until Tuesday.
[time=2436] "I don't think I can wait until then to find out how I did.
[time=2439] "Would you grade my paper right now?" He said, "Yeah, I think I can do that.
[time=2443] "Come up to my office in about 15 minutes "and I should have it graded by then." Well, he took out his red pen and headed for his office.
[time=2450] Well, I passed about 15 minutes standing in the hallway rather nervously and finally knocked on his door and I came in and he had his red pen on.
[time=2459] Boy, he was working on this one paper.
[time=2461] Later found out that wasn't mine and boy was I glad.
[time=2464] But as I went up to Dr. Zemic, I said, "Well, do you have my test graded?" He says, "Yeah." He had a rather rice smile on his face.
[time=2470] I thought that sounded good, looked good, so I took my exam and there it was, a 93.
[time=2476] Well, that wasn't an A, but that was a B plus and I was pretty satisfied with that.
[time=2481] I remember looking at him and I said, "Well, Dr. Zemic, what do you think?" Looked up at me with that same rice smile.
[time=2487] This is a great theologian, by the way.
[time=2489] And he said to me, "Well, in the immortal words "of John Calvin, you lucked out." (audience laughing) Then he looked back at me and he said, "No, you didn't luck out.
[time=2500] "You worked hard, congratulations." And he shook my hand.
[time=2502] The course was finished.
[time=2504] But I remember knowing in that Hebrew class that only when I sewed into it, I was gonna harvest at the end.
[time=2510] And if I hadn't put the effort into it, I never would have harvested a good grade in the course.
[time=2515] It's a basic principle of life, but Paul says it's a definite principle in the area of Christian giving, sowing what we reap.
[time=2525] Well, God was unsparing and generous in what he sowed into our lives.
[time=2530] God gave the very best.
[time=2533] God gave his son, Jesus Christ, watched him die on the cross and agonizing death, shed his innocent blood.
[time=2540] And I'm sure that that agonized God as he watched his son suffering on the cross.
[time=2547] God gave unsparingly.
[time=2549] And I believe that Paul is challenging us in this verse to do the same thing as we return that blessing to God, to give him back what he has given to us as best we can.
[time=2560] Well, the principle presented in verse six, and then in verse seven as we move on, I want to point out the second rule of New Testament giving.
[time=2569] And that is the proper motive that is required.
[time=2576] He goes on to say in verse seven, each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=2587] Paul's speaking here about motives.
[time=2590] You know, if we return to the idea of the farmer for a few moments, it really doesn't make a difference what the motive is of a farmer.
[time=2597] As long as he plants his seed, and as long as the proper weather comes, several months down the road, he's going to harvest his crop.
[time=2605] It makes no difference what motive he has.
[time=2608] If he's doing it selfishly just to get wealthy, he's going to harvest his crop.
[time=2612] If he's doing it just for pride to be the largest farmer in all of the area, he's still going to harvest his crop.
[time=2619] But Paul says here that motive is very important for us as New Testament believers in our giving, and in giving back to God what he has first given to us.
[time=2630] He says first of all, each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give.
[time=2635] The key word there is the word translated in the new international version decided.
[time=2641] Another version says purposed.
[time=2643] The idea is that careful planning, careful prayer and consideration is to be given as we prepare to determine how much we will give each year.
[time=2656] That word there talks of a carefully planned decision.
[time=2661] It talks about prayerfully considering in our own heart looking at what God has given us, looking at all that we have and the income that we have and carefully determining what we should and can give to God in that coming year.
[time=2678] I think there's a great principle there.
[time=2680] I think Paul is teaching us that as we make a New Year's resolution, we can make a commitment and we can carefully plan our giving.
[time=2689] Giving is not supposed to be something scattered.
[time=2692] It's not to be something that is unsystematic.
[time=2695] It's to be regular, it's to be planned, and it's to be consistent.
[time=2700] Oh, Paul says that we are to give as we purpose in our heart as a wise steward.
[time=2705] But notice something else there.
[time=2707] Notice that Paul did not give any type of minimum quota or minimum percentage there.
[time=2715] I do not believe, myself personally, that tithing is a New Testament concept.
[time=2720] Under the Old Testament Jewish law, if you go back into Deuteronomy in the book of Leviticus, you will see that tithing, giving a tenth, was important, it was prescribed by law to the Jewish believers.
[time=2734] They had no choice.
[time=2735] They were to give a tenth of all that they had each year.
[time=2738] In fact, often they were to give a temple tax on top of that and once every few years they also gave another tithe on top of that.
[time=2746] Many of them were actually giving some years 30% of their income.
[time=2750] Well, I personally do not believe that tithing, giving a tenth, is prescribed as law in this age of grace in which we live.
[time=2761] However, let's go back to what Paul said.
[time=2764] Paul said that each of us are to purpose within our heart.
[time=2769] And he will later say that we are to give as the Lord has given to us.
[time=2775] I do not believe that by the fact that we are not under the law that that gives us any reason to feel that we are not obligated to consistent giving to our Lord.
[time=2786] I believe that all scripture is profitable and although we're not under the law, I believe that 10% is a great place to start.
[time=2794] I think it's a great place to start as we plan our giving and as we seek to give our money back to the Lord's work.
[time=2802] If you're here today and you've never practiced systematic tithing, well, I think 10% is a great place to start, a great target to shoot for.
[time=2810] But then I also believe that when it says that we are to give as God has blessed us, that that means that as time goes on, our giving should increase.
[time=2821] And I believe that as our treasure increases and as our lifestyle becomes more affluent, that perhaps even more than that 10% might be required of us as we give back to God what he has given to us.
[time=2834] Are we under the law?
[time=2835] No.
[time=2836] But our giving is to be sacrificial based upon our possessions, personally determined, generous in view of God's supply to us.
[time=2845] And I think that's the way we need to approach our giving.
[time=2848] One of the great preachers of another era was Harry Ironsides and he wrote this.
[time=2853] The least a consistent child of God in Old Testament times could give was a 10th.
[time=2858] Certainly as a Christian living under grace, I shall not do less than was required of a consistent Jew.
[time=2865] The 10th therefore will be the minimum and I will give more according as God prospers me.
[time=2872] There Paul, I should say Dr. Ironsides is giving a picture of what New Testament giving ought to be.
[time=2879] Well, let's go on with what he says there.
[time=2880] He says that our giving is not to be done reluctantly.
[time=2884] That word there means grudgingly.
[time=2886] He said we're not to have such a whole of our money that we have to grudgingly give it to the Lord's work.
[time=2893] Then he goes on to say not only is it not to be reluctant, but it's not to be done under compulsion.
[time=2899] That Greek word there really means angrily.
[time=2902] We are not to be angry that it's commanded of us that we give to the Lord as he has prospered us.
[time=2909] Then he goes on to say for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=2915] Oh God loves all of us, God loves all men.
[time=2918] But what he is saying there is God loves especially and is blessed by the one who cheerfully gives of what God has given him and sows that seed back into the work of the Lord.
[time=2931] God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=2934] Giving is a serious and important thing.
[time=2937] But if our heart is right, I believe Paul is saying it will be a delightful experience.
[time=2945] A man came in to see his pastor one day.
[time=2948] He looked rather dejected and forlorn.
[time=2950] The pastor said what's the matter?
[time=2952] He said well pastor you've got to pray for me.
[time=2954] You see when I used to make about $200 a week I had no problem at all giving liberally and joyfully to the Lord's work.
[time=2961] I enjoyed giving, it was a wonderful experience.
[time=2965] But you see now I make $2,000 a week and for some reason I've gotten caught up in all the things that are out there and all the things the world has to offer and I'm no longer a cheerful giver.
[time=2975] I don't know what's wrong but pray for me pastor.
[time=2978] I know that it's wrong.
[time=2979] Well the pastor said okay let's pray.
[time=2982] Vowed his head and he prayed this.
[time=2984] Father please reduce this man's income to $200 so he can get back into your will.
[time=2989] Oh perhaps a bit extreme.
[time=2993] But the pastor was saying we need to be faithful givers.
[time=2998] You may have heard the story about the family who went home from church one Sunday morning.
[time=3002] They were having their dinner and well it wasn't long before they started that one of the teenage boys said boy that sermon sure was boring today.
[time=3011] Not too long after that his younger sister chimed in and said yeah it was boring.
[time=3016] And could you believe the way the pastor stumbled over the scripture reading?
[time=3020] Few moments later the mom and the family chimed in and she said yeah the choir uninspiring.
[time=3028] What a poor choice of music.
[time=3030] I just think it was not a great experience today.
[time=3033] And finally the father looked at the rest of the family and he said yeah I just don't understand why the preacher doesn't get some humor into his messages.
[time=3040] I'm tired of the same old dry boring messages.
[time=3044] Well there was a little eight year old boy sitting there at the table with them and he looked rather indignantly at the rest of his family.
[time=3050] He said I don't know what you guys expect for a quarter.
[time=3059] We sow what we reap.
[time=3061] Well what's Paul saying in this verse?
[time=3064] He's saying that we are not to give grudgingly or reluctantly but we are to give cheerfully.
[time=3071] We are to give systematically plan willfully according to the way that God has prospered us.
[time=3078] That would be our challenge this morning from this verse that we would all seek to examine our personal financial situation to examine it carefully and prayerfully determine in advance what our stewardship needs to be in this year for the Lord's work here at Blackhawk.
[time=3096] Oh it's so clear from scripture what he has to say to us today.
[time=3100] But let's move on 'cause in verses eight through 11 we have the third point and that is the third rule, the return on our investment.
[time=3108] The return on our investment is found in verses eight through 11.
[time=3112] Paul goes on to say and God is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work.
[time=3123] Oh what's Paul saying?
[time=3125] He's saying basically this in verse eight.
[time=3127] God will provide for your needs both spiritually and materially as you give of your life materially and spiritually to his work.
[time=3139] He is saying that as you give to the work of the church and the work of the Lord God will make sure that your needs are met.
[time=3147] Now perhaps there's somebody here this morning and you might be saying to yourself I'm not sure my needs are being met.
[time=3154] I'm looking around and I see so many people that have so much more than I do.
[time=3159] They have bigger homes and bigger cars and well I'm not sure that God is honoring his promise here.
[time=3165] I think it's a key thing that in this society in which we live in America that rather than look around at others we need to consider what God truly said here.
[time=3176] For what we need is a relative term.
[time=3179] God said he will provide us with what we need not necessarily with all the things that we determine we need to be happy in life.
[time=3189] No he also said that we are to be content in the circumstances of life.
[time=3193] Now this is not a promise of wealth it's not a promise it's not to be used for prosperity theology but he is saying that he will meet all of our needs in all of our circumstances.
[time=3204] Now why does he do that?
[time=3205] He does it because he loves us but he also does that so we can keep the cycle going.
[time=3212] We give, he gives back to us.
[time=3214] We then give again and we can keep the cycle of giving and blessing going in our lives.
[time=3222] Oh Paul says God will meet our needs.
[time=3225] You know I remember so well when my wife and I were first married.
[time=3229] I remember going through the entire first year of marriage with a hundred dollars in the bank that we had gotten for our wedding present and we had stayed there we didn't have to use it but we certainly never added to it.
[time=3240] And when it came to our first year of marriage we were hurting financially.
[time=3245] I remember very well how excited we would get when we'd look in the newspaper coupons and we would see that Kroger had craft macaroni on sale, five boxes for a dollar.
[time=3254] That was a big thing back then to us.
[time=3256] I remember when a lady who had been in a bad car accident and no longer wanted an automobile gave it to us for free and said here you can use this for your wife's transportation needs as she goes back and forth to school.
[time=3268] I got to tell you about this car.
[time=3270] It had been in a very bad car accident, it had a bent frame and as Linda would go down the street she constantly looked like she was ready to make a left hand turn.
[time=3278] But you know the car got us back and forth and got her back and forth for a period of a couple of years and when it would break down a use part would fit and one of our friends would put the part on, you know as much as we had nothing, God did meet our needs.
[time=3294] And though we have so much more today than what we had then, God meets our needs now but he met our needs faithfully then.
[time=3303] And he said, I'll meet your needs.
[time=3306] Bill Heibels, the pastor of the large Willow Creek Community Church in Chicago, Illinois shared something in one of his most recent books.
[time=3314] He spoke about being invited to India to speak at a revival service.
[time=3319] He was invited to go to a revival service in India and to speak to the people of that church in Calcutta.
[time=3325] Oh, it was a very, very poor church.
[time=3327] And he said he put his foot in his mouth 'cause he walked up to the pastor after the end of the morning worship service and he said, you know, pastor, it must just make your people's hearts ache that they can't give anything to the Lord.
[time=3339] It must make them feel terrible that they are so poor they can't give.
[time=3344] The pastor looked at Bill Heibels rather indignantly and said, no, that's not true.
[time=3349] Our people do give.
[time=3350] You see, each week they go down to the market and they buy a bag of rice that's gonna be their food for the week.
[time=3356] And each time they scoop out a serving of rice for each member of the family.
[time=3359] They also scoop out one extra serving and they set it aside in another little bag.
[time=3364] By the end of the week, they have scooped up about 15 servings of rice.
[time=3369] They bring that bag to church on Sunday morning.
[time=3371] They put it in the offering and they give it to those families in Calcutta that are less fortunate than they are.
[time=3378] Again, our needs are relative but they were still able to give and to bless others and the Lord met their needs for food.
[time=3388] Well, he goes on to say a few things here in these verses.
[time=3390] In verse eight though, he is speaking to us about the fact that God will meet our needs.
[time=3395] He does return that to us.
[time=3396] In verse nine he says, he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor, his righteousness endures forever.
[time=3403] What he is saying there is that a man walking in tune with God, a righteous man, as he walks through life, sees the needs that are there, sees the needs that are before his eyes and gives of his treasure to meet those needs and his righteousness, those righteous charitable acts are remembered by God forever.
[time=3423] And God remembers the cheerful giver who gives of his own sustenance.
[time=3428] And then in verse 10 he gives us another important point.
[time=3431] He says, now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
[time=3443] He goes back to the image of the farmer and he says this, God is the source of all the seed.
[time=3450] And it is God who takes the seed and brings about the harvest for the farmer.
[time=3455] God is the one who supplies the harvest.
[time=3459] And Paul says, God will do the same for us.
[time=3462] God will provide us with a harvest of righteousness.
[time=3467] Now I think a fair question at this point is what is the harvest of righteousness?
[time=3472] Well I believe that the harvest of righteousness for most of us today here at Blackhawk comes like this.
[time=3478] We come each week and we give a portion of our treasure into the Lord's work to carry on the ministries of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=3487] It helps to carry on all of the various ministries as we attempt to minister to people within our church.
