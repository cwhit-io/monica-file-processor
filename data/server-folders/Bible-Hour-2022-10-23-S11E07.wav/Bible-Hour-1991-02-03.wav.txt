[time=30] (gentle music)
[time=60] (bell ringing)
[time=90] The secret of the priest of the Old Testament in his success with the people of God was that he walked with God and talked about God.
[time=112] When we come to the pages of the New Testament, I think we'll discover there's an interesting parallel there for us to follow.
[time=119] (gentle music)
[time=132] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=139] Speaking today is David Fetser, Associate Professor of Speech at Moody Bible Institute. His message is entitled "If I Were a Priest."
[time=148] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Malachi, Chapter 2. We will be looking at Verses 1 through 9.
[time=157] Special music includes a duet from Keith and star Brodigum, an instrumental from the trumpet trio, and a solo from Keith Brodigum.
[time=168] Let's join our service with the song from the Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra entitled "I Don't Know Why."
[time=176] (gentle music)
[time=190] [MUSIC - 181 seconds]
[time=386] [APPLAUSE]
[time=393] Sometimes it is difficult, isn't it, when we look at ourselves and wonder why God loved us, but he did, and he gave his life for us.
[time=400] Today of rejoicing, that's going to be when we all get to heaven and see Jesus, Him number 542.
[time=406] We'll sing all four verses together of Him number 542.
[time=411] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=571] Amen, thank you for your good singing and that great prospect of the victory we have in Jesus Christ.
[time=576] We continue with music now as we listen to music sung by Keith and Starr Brontagum.
[time=581] Joyful, joyful, we adore thee.
[time=584] [MUSIC]
[time=599] Joyful, joyful, we adore thee.
[time=608] [MUSIC - 116 seconds]
[time=753] [APPLAUSE]
[time=760] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=763] I saw many of you at the rally that we had with Dr. John MacArthur just a few days ago at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=770] I'm glad that so many of you could come and hear this inspiring speaker.
[time=774] I hope it was worth your while to be with us that evening.
[time=777] It's always nice to see you in person as opposed to just assuming that you're watching on television.
[time=782] And speaking of John MacArthur, he's in the area in the future days here at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=790] And our guest today is from Moody Bible Institute, David Fetser.
[time=794] Good morning, David.
[time=795] Good morning, Pete.
[time=796] Dave, you're in the communications department there at Moody.
[time=799] How long have you been there?
[time=800] This is my ninth year, Pete.
[time=802] There are some interesting things that happen at Moody.
[time=805] I know they have the radio station WMBI that's been so effective in communications over the years.
[time=811] And also having come from a family whose parents attended Moody, I know about the Moody Founders Week.
[time=819] And that's coming up soon.
[time=821] It starts Tuesday, actually Monday night of this week.
[time=824] Dr. Stole has the opening address on Monday night.
[time=827] Goes for the entire week through Sunday.
[time=829] And it features some terrific speakers from around the country, including Dr. MacArthur.
[time=833] He'll be there this week.
[time=834] It's a week-long Bible conference that's celebrated every year at the time of the birthday of DL Moody.
[time=842] It's been very successful.
[time=844] Our facilities aren't quite big enough, so we move down to Moody Church and use their facilities.
[time=849] But it's a terrific conference.
[time=851] Usually thousands of people show up.
[time=853] I received a book just a few weeks ago that was the first hundred years of Moody.
[time=858] And what a magnificent heritage that's there.
[time=861] And do you mention Dr. Stole, who's now the president.
[time=864] George Sweeting has been here and spoken to our church.
[time=868] You mentioned great speakers that were going to be there.
[time=871] David Fetser's going to speak at Foundry Week.
[time=873] This year, they're using the faculty at the 11 o'clock hour each day.
[time=878] And I'll be on with some of my peers on that day.
[time=881] That'd be a lot of fun.
[time=882] I'm looking forward to it.
[time=883] Well, we do pray for our Christian schools and appreciate the ministry of all of you that sacrificed, really.
[time=888] To teach and minister to our kids in preparation for life.
[time=892] So we're glad for you and glad for Moody Bible Institute and the great heritage that it's had over the years.
[time=898] I want to emphasize another special date.
[time=902] That's Sunday morning, February 17th.
[time=905] We will have Dick and Melody Tunney.
[time=907] Dick and Melody are formally with the first call.
[time=911] Dick has written a number of songs for Sandy Patty and other great singers that we hear.
[time=919] He's a fine pianist.
[time=920] Melanie's a gorgeous singer.
[time=922] They're going to be with us Sunday morning, February 17th.
[time=925] I hope you can set that day to sign and join with us.
[time=928] They'll be here in our 9/15 service and also at 10/50.
[time=932] A great gifted couple and they'll be with us February 17th on Sunday morning.
[time=938] And then as you probably have noted through television and other publications that today as we're recording this,
[time=946] President Bush has declared this National Day of Prayer for our soldiers in the Gulf.
[time=952] And we want to be found faithful here at Blackhawk Praying for our soldiers.
[time=956] Last couple weeks ago, I asked for names of people who were directly involved in the desert storm that were involved with people here at our church
[time=967] and related and friends.
[time=969] And we had a number, over a hundred names that we're now praying for.
[time=973] And we want to be found faithful praying for our soldiers out there.
[time=977] Also, just this week, I received a beautiful sketch of a soldier with a hand over his shoulder reminding us that Jesus can protect us during this time.
[time=989] And I've gone to Psalm 119, 114, and it says, "Thou art my shield, I will hope in thee."
[time=996] We've made copies of this sketch that was drawn by Lisa Reniker, one of our members of our church.
[time=1003] And we're going to make them available so that you can have them to remember to pray for our soldiers.
[time=1009] If you'd like to receive a copy of this print, you can receive it by sending $10 or more to the Bible Hour.
[time=1016] That's 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1023] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1033] This print will be available this week.
[time=1035] It's a great encouragement to remember that God is in control, and we need to pray for our servicemen and women.
[time=1041] I hope you'll write for a copy of this print this week.
[time=1044] Well, it's been good having you, and I hope that you will stay for the remainder of our program and listen to our message and more music on the Bible Hour.
[time=1074] [MUSIC - 90 seconds]
[time=1169] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1177] Scott was playing a little earlier, "Rise Up O Church," and that song said "His Truth."
[time=1183] Glory, Glory, Hallelujah. His truth is marching on. May that be so in our church today. Let's bow in prayer.
[time=1189] [MUSIC]
[time=1193] Our Father, the Word says that you are our shield, and I put my hope in thee. We're thankful for that.
[time=1202] Again, we're thankful for our church, where we can come together with believers, and we can come and put our arms around each other, and look at each other, and just uphold each other in times of need.
[time=1212] We've been praying for a number of months now for Joni, and Ron King, and Bob Dolan, Joni's father, who has cancer, and he passed away this week.
[time=1223] Let me just pray that you'll be with that family now as they not only have dealt with the upcoming death, but now death itself.
[time=1231] And we pray that you'll just give them the peace that passes all understanding right now.
[time=1236] Pray for David Renicker, we pray that you'll heal his body, physical problems that he has, and the doctors will have wisdom to know what to do, that he can live comfortably again.
[time=1247] Pray for Audra Richard. She is ill this morning and in the hospital, Lord, and she's had so many seizures, so many difficult times in her life for such a young girl.
[time=1257] Pray for Martian, Ed, too, that you'll just strengthen them as they go through these trying times of wondering why...
[time=1265] there can't be an answer to her health problem.
[time=1268] And Lord, we have unspoken requests that can't be mentioned today, but you know them, and there's some real hurts in lives today.
[time=1275] We pray that you'll enter see there, and you'll heal some problems.
[time=1278] You'll strengthen some believers that have done wrong and help them to restore to them the joy of the Lord.
[time=1286] Thank you for the promise that you forgive, because you say if we confess our sins, you are faithful and just to forgive us of our sins.
[time=1293] We pray for those out there and all of us as we have sin in our lives that will be found faithful and confessing it, so we can have pure hearts before you and know the joy of the Lord.
[time=1303] Let's just as we continue this service, thank you for the music that inspires our hearts.
[time=1308] We pray for David Fethors. He speaks in a moment, and not only will he be, have the freedom to speak, but that our hearts will be open.
[time=1316] Draw our hearts toward you, Lord, in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=1323] [MUSIC]
[time=1413] Holy, weary, heavy laden, lost and rolled by the fall, if you carry till you battle, you may never come at home.
[time=1441] I will arise and go to Jesus, he will embrace me in his arms, in the arms of my dear Savior.
[time=1460] Hold our hearts and close and close.
[time=1468] ♪
[time=1474] Come he thirsty, come and welcome, God's free bounty, glorify, truly, and true repentance, every grace that brings you nigh.
[time=1499] I will rise and go to Jesus, he will embrace me in his arms, in the arms of my dear Savior.
[time=1518] Hold our hearts and close and trust.
[time=1525] We hear arms of my dear Savior.
[time=1535] Hold our hearts and close and trust.
[time=1555] I want to say a special thank you to Keith and Starr Brontigam for their great ministry of music today.
[time=1564] I have been blessed by all of the music, particularly one of thanks Scott Schindler again too.
[time=1569] So often we hear him play on the organ and the piano and we just assume that he is going to be here and forget about him really.
[time=1575] He is just a wonderful help, I can't tell you how much I appreciate him and his ministry at the keyboards, it's just great.
[time=1584] This song talked about the healing and the arms that God opens up to embrace us.
[time=1589] It reminded me, it might sound a little awkward, it reminded me of an old Volkswagen I had when I was in Oregon.
[time=1595] It was so battered and beaten up that it had a great big band-aid across the front of the hood, it was a little beetle.
[time=1602] When I bought it someone had painted a band-aid across, it was very appropriate for the car because it was so wrecked.
[time=1608] My friend David Fetser loved to work on cars and usually they were antique cars that were worth something but I talked them into taking this Volkswagen and revitalizing it.
[time=1618] He came out with this beautiful blue car that was all, the dens were all taken out and a beautiful finish on it and really was able to take cars and do that.
[time=1629] I thought of that too and as I was listening I thought of David's ministry to young people as he taught at Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1637] Now it's been that for a number of years at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, not only can he fix cars and make them look better but he's willing to open his heart and his mind and time to help young people.
[time=1650] He's been doing that for a number of years and I just really appreciate that aspect of his life.
[time=1655] This is the third time that David's been here. It's been a delight to have him each time and I look forward to his message today.
[time=1661] Would you welcome David Fetser please.
[time=1670] Thank you so much and that's a new introduction. I've never been introduced that way before.
[time=1676] That was a lot of fun back in those days working on cars and every once in a while I got cajoled into doing something like Pete's Volkswagen.
[time=1685] And also working with kids and of course that over time gave rise to the name of my little company named Dave's Body and Soul Shop.
[time=1694] But thank you again for inviting me. I appreciate coming here and sharing with you what a great spirit there is in this church and a minister with great music.
[time=1704] It's a real privilege. There's little doubt I suspect that at the present time a major focus here at the church can be stated in one word and that's the word pastor.
[time=1714] I'm sure there is a lot of thinking and a lot of talking about the characteristics and the qualities and the expectations of the person who would be the chief pastor here.
[time=1726] Job descriptions, personality profiles, maybe dreams and preferences are being talked about in conversations and in committees.
[time=1736] And I would like to suggest this morning that it's possible to change just one word in your focus. Instead of saying we're thinking about a pastor, would you think this morning about a priest?
[time=1750] What would you expect if we were hiring a priest here at the church? What would he do? What would he be like?
[time=1760] Now if you were a Jewish person in the days of ancient Israel several hundred years before the time of Christ, you would probably respond to that question about a leader named a priest.
[time=1773] You would say, well, I would expect him to know the law of Moses. I would expect this person to be able to teach it. I'd expect him to lead us in the sacrifices and in the worship.
[time=1786] Really just to give us basic spiritual leadership. And your expectations would be pretty close to God's own job description.
[time=1798] This morning we want to look in the last book of the Old Testament, the little book of Malachi. If you're not familiar with Malachi, why go to Matthew and turn left?
[time=1810] And it's just back one book. We want to look in Malachi about the priests at the priests. But in order to do that, we need to refresh our thinking as to God's job description, what a priest is, what he does.
[time=1827] Keep your finger there in Malachi and I'm going to read a few verses from Leviticus. You don't need to look there. Just listen as we go back in time long before Malachi's day to understand what a priest was expected to do and to be.
[time=1843] Moses says in verse 7 of Leviticus 9, "Come to the altar. Sacrifice your sin offering, your burnt offering. Make atonement for yourself and the people." He says in verse 22, Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them, having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering. He stepped down.
[time=1865] Then in chapter 10, the Lord said to Aaron, "You must distinguish between the holy and the profane, between the unclean and the clean, and you must teach the Israelites all the decrees the Lord has given them through Moses."
[time=1882] You see some key words there jumped out at us on the responsibilities and the role of a priest, make sacrifice, bless the people, distinguish between right and wrong, holy and profane, teach the decrees of God to the people.
[time=1901] They're laid out for us very clearly is what God expected of a priest. But time, time and the people who occupy time have a certain way of changing things.
[time=1917] Most institutions have a way if they are not carefully maintained of running down and degenerating into some kind of routine.
[time=1928] And by the time we come here to Malachi, this last book of the Old Testament, the priesthood had come under the wrath and the judgment of God.
[time=1938] We're going to look at Malachi chapter 2, but perhaps if you've ever read this little prophecy, you are aware of what happened in chapter 1.
[time=1947] You're aware of the fact that God began his indictment on the nation of Israel, and particularly the priests. He says it is youo priests who despise my name, by spelling out the fact that their worship had degenerated.
[time=1963] They had somehow come to the place where on a given morning, a family would get up to go to the temple and offer sacrifice.
[time=1971] But the father would say to the little boy, why go on out back and get a lamp, why don't you get that one with the limp in his leg, get that one.
[time=1980] He's not very sellable, get him, and father would rub some salve on that muscle and get it working at least okay, and he'd take it to the temple for sacrifice.
[time=1991] And apparently when he got to the temple, he found a priest there who would say, "Oh, that's okay, don't worry about it, we'll take care of it.
[time=1998] Bring it on in, come on in, bring your sickly sacrifice, bring your grain that is too impure to be sold. Give it to God, it doesn't matter."
[time=2008] But God said in chapter 1, verse number 7, "It is youo priests who despise my name. You have placed defiled food on my altar."
[time=2019] And it's interesting that God not only was very aware of their behavior, but he was aware of their attitudes as well.
[time=2026] He knew what they were doing and he knew what precipitated and motivated them.
[time=2031] And he said, "What you are doing is because somehow, attitudinally, you despise my name."
[time=2038] This morning I want us to learn about the priesthood of the past in order to understand the priesthood of the present.
[time=2046] In order to do that, look with me in Malachi chapter 2, listen in on three aspects of Malachi's message to the priests.
[time=2056] The verse aspect found in chapter 2 is the priest's curse, the possible curse that will be laid on these priests.
[time=2065] He says, "This admonition is for youo priests. This admonition, this statement, this thread of punishment is for youo priests."
[time=2077] He says, "If you don't listen," verse 2, "and if you do not set your heart to honor my name," says the Lord Almighty, "I will send a curse upon you.
[time=2086] I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already cursed them because you have not set your heart to honor me.
[time=2092] Because of you, I will rebuke your descendants. I will spread on your faces the awful from the festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it."
[time=2103] Notice there that God says in verse 2, "I will curse your blessings."
[time=2110] God would, because of their carelessness and their sin, curse the blessings pronounced by the priests on the people.
[time=2121] Remember in Leviticus the little verse we noted a few minutes ago that one of the roles of the priests was to communicate the blessing of God on the people.
[time=2130] That was their role. They not only went to God, but they took a message from God, and the blessing of God was communicated to the people by these priests.
[time=2139] But here he says he will make their blessing ineffective. In fact, he will turn it the opposite direction.
[time=2148] So our family that comes with this sickly sacrifice, and the priest says, "It's okay, don't worry about it."
[time=2154] And they offer it, and as they leave that place of sacrifice, the priest is waiting there, perhaps at the back door, down at the front, wherever he stood.
[time=2162] And as this family filed out why he patted the heads of the children and said, "Jehovah, bless you." And the father, he said, "The Lord bless your family, and the Lord bless your crops. Do you understand that that was the kiss of death on this family?"
[time=2176] Their blessing was a curse in disguise, God says.
[time=2183] You ever pause to concern yourself with the implications of your sin on other people?
[time=2192] You see, these people were losing God's blessing because their spiritual leadership sinned.
[time=2201] You see, we never sin in a vacuum, do we?
[time=2205] We may commit our sin alone. We may cheat out of anybody's sight. We may lie, and nobody knows it.
[time=2215] We may sin alone, but God doesn't really judge us alone because the wages of our sin, which is death, reaches out and touches the people around us.
[time=2228] And even though we go to him and confess our sin, we never want to be in a place where we are just sinning, knowing that there's forgiveness.
[time=2237] Paul says, "God forbid that that happened." But when we do sin and it is not covered by the blood of Christ as we confess it, the judgment on that sin will touch those around us.
[time=2251] The lie, the cheating, if nothing else will influence who we are, the kind of person we are, and that'll touch the person, the people around us.
[time=2259] It isn't a tragic that it so often is the people who are closest to us who pay the penalty of our sin.
[time=2267] God would curse their blessings. And also, notice, verse number three, he would curse their seed or their descendants.
[time=2274] There would be an awful and a public display. He tells them that the refuse, the waste from the unacceptable sacrifices would somehow be spread on their faces.
[time=2284] The very same lame, sickly sacrifices that they offer to God would be returned to them. They would be taken away with it.
[time=2293] What a terrible curse. What an awful statement of judgment. Why? Why did it have to happen?
[time=2300] The answer is very simple. It is because the priests had violated, and that's the second aspect of this message.
[time=2307] The priest had violated the past pattern of the Levitic, Aaronic priesthood.
[time=2314] God says in verse number four, "You will know that I have sent you this admonition so that my covenant with Levi may continue."
[time=2325] The covenant is more than just a contract. It's more than just a legal agreement. It was a relationship, a personal commitment on God's part to these people.
[time=2336] And he says, "My covenant was a long-term covenant, and it was made with the family back then, but it will continue, and it must continue."
[time=2347] And then in the heart of this passage, there's a paragraph that just leaps from the page to me in verse number five as he describes the covenant and the behavior of those involved.
[time=2359] He says, "My covenant was with him a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him this called for reverence, and he revered me and stood in awe of my name."
[time=2372] True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing false was found on his lips.
[time=2378] He walked with me in peace and in integrity, and turned many from their sin.
[time=2387] For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek instruction because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.
[time=2397] A covenant, a covenant with this family, these priests that continued even in Malachi's day, a covenant of life and peace.
[time=2407] God gave them quality life, and God granted peace by the forgiveness of sin to these people, and in response they gave service and respect and awe.
[time=2420] But by Malachi's day, apparently the gift of life and peace was old hat.
[time=2426] Routine, confused for the normal, misunderstood.
[time=2433] Reminds me of the two street people in downtown Chicago, they were standing on the corner one day, just watching the traffic go by when along came a funeral procession.
[time=2443] And of course at the head of the procession was a long, sleek, black, hearse.
[time=2450] On the hearse was shiny, and the chrome reflected, and even the glass was so clean and reflected the gaze of these two street men as they looked at it go on by.
[time=2462] And staring at themselves in the black gloss on the side of that hearse, one of them was heard to say to the other, "Man, that's living."
[time=2472] Wait a minute, gentlemen, you're confused. That's not living, that's a symbol of death.
[time=2479] Malachi's priests thought they were living.
[time=2482] They thought this was life, to stand there at the temple and accept these unacceptable sacrifices.
[time=2489] Hey, isn't that just the way sin deceives?
[time=2494] Isn't that just the way sin comes in and distorts our standards and make us think that what is right is not, what is wrong is right, and what is right is not, and we get all twisted and distorted.
[time=2508] Their world had become so routine and satisfying and maybe even profitable that it took a message like Malachi's to bring them to their senses.
[time=2518] But you see, the pattern that was set for them by the priests of old had set up a different tune, talk about accomplishments.
[time=2528] I love the last line of verse number six. He turned many from sin.
[time=2535] That just sends a chill down my spine to think that here's a man that when life was done for him, God didn't say, "Boy, he gave a lot, built a big building."
[time=2546] And he established this, he wrote on his tombstone, he turned people from their sin.
[time=2552] Wouldn't you like to have that set of you?
[time=2554] When it's all said and done, "Oh, he paid your bills, made an inheritance," what no, he turned people from their sin.
[time=2561] How eternally satisfying to be able to be an agent of God to turn people from sin.
[time=2569] How does that happen?
[time=2572] Text tells us, verse six, "True instruction was in his mouth. Nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and in integrity."
[time=2585] You see, here's a priest of old who walked with God in peace and in singleness of purpose, committed to the task of representing God to the people.
[time=2598] He walked with me in peace and integrity, and secondly, he talked about me.
[time=2604] His walk was the basis for what he said. Notice in verses six and seven, there's a lot of communication language there.
[time=2612] This is a man who walked with God, but I note verse six, "True instruction was in his mouth. Nothing false was found on his lips."
[time=2619] Verse seven, "The lips of a priest preserved knowledge from his mouth men seek instruction."
[time=2625] You see, he walked with God, he had established a peaceful relationship with God, and he walked with God in singularity and integrity.
[time=2635] In the text has your, perhaps your text has the word uprightness.
[time=2640] And as a result, he was able to talk about God. The word for instruction here, in verse number seven, takes us back to the law.
[time=2648] The priests were teachers of the law. Not only did they bring people to God, but they brought God to the people.
[time=2657] They walked with God, and they talked about God.
[time=2662] I'm interested to notice that as we walk with God, we also need to talk about God.
[time=2667] No one is really one to Christ by a silent testimony.
[time=2671] That may be an influence, but the Bible says, "How shall they hear without a speaker?"
[time=2677] So we need to walk with God, but we also need to talk about God.
[time=2682] That's not what was happening in Malachi's day.
[time=2685] The reality of Malachi's day is that these priests had simply not followed the pattern.
[time=2691] As priests, they were almost unrecognizable. They couldn't be known by their walk, they couldn't be known by their talk.
[time=2700] It reminded of the old story of an actress years ago named Billy Burke.
[time=2705] She was on an ocean cruise when she noticed a gentleman at the next table suffering from a bad cold.
[time=2713] "Oh my, I know just what to do," she volunteered.
[time=2717] Now you go back to your cabin, drink lots and lots of orange juice, take five aspirin,
[time=2723] cover yourself with all the blankets you can find and sweat this cold out.
[time=2728] And I know what I'm talking about. I'm actress Billy Burke of Hollywood.
[time=2733] The man smiled warmly and introduced himself in return.
[time=2737] "Thanks so much," he said, "I'm Dr. Mayo of the Mayo Clinic."
[time=2743] Well, I can understand not recognizing Dr. Mayo, but I can't understand not being able to recognize the priest of God.
[time=2751] Whose talk was distorted, whose walk was in error, and the people apparently could get no leadership from this priest.
[time=2759] They couldn't know God from these priests. That's why the third aspect of this message is the priest's problem.
[time=2767] We've seen the curse on these priests. We've looked at the pattern that was set for them in the past.
[time=2772] Finally, notice the problem the priests have. Very simple. They'd been untrue to their profession through false teaching, through false example.
[time=2781] The law was no longer a light. It was a stumbling block. Verse 8 tells us, "You have turned from the way.
[time=2788] By your teaching have caused many to stumble." God forbid that that is what is said of us.
[time=2795] I want to turn people away from their sin. These priests, the text says, "You have caused people to stumble.
[time=2803] You have violated the covenant with Levi," says the Lord Almighty.
[time=2807] "So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you've not followed my ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the law."
[time=2818] People were confused. They were in disarray because of the teaching of God's messengers.
[time=2825] Can you imagine this? Can you fathom this? The opportunity, the privilege, the possibility these people had.
[time=2833] God's spokesman with his news, and they bombed out. They blew it. They failed. They had nothing to give to the people.
[time=2842] Like the little boy who took an exam. When it was over, he was so shook up. The teacher said,
[time=2851] "Students know I want you to write a pledge that you have neither given nor received any help." This little guy squirming and mopping his brow wrote, "I ain't received no help, and Lord knows I couldn't give none."
[time=2864] That's the way these priests were. They had nothing from God, and they had nothing to offer.
[time=2870] Why? Because they turned away from walking with God.
[time=2874] They ceased walking with God in life and in peace and in integrity. They ceased speaking God's truth and turning people from their sin.
[time=2883] If you were one of these priests, how would you respond? What would you do?
[time=2890] I hope you'd consider this and what's going on here, and you'd say, "Well, I'd straighten up. I'd get my act together. I'd begin to walk with God."
[time=2900] And as a result of walking with God, I'd communicate his truth, and I'd work at turning men from their sin.
[time=2906] If I were a priest, that's what I'd do. Bless your heart. That's great. You're wise.
[time=2913] I remind you this morning that if you know Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord,
[time=2919] if you've come to the place in your experience where you realize that Jesus Christ shed his blood for you and forgave your sin,
[time=2928] need I remind you that you are a priest before God.
[time=2935] We've been talking about the priesthood of the past, but the New Testament speaks of a priesthood of the present.
[time=2942] If you know Christ, you're a part of it. Do you remember the words of the apostle Peter?
[time=2949] When he wrote in 1 Peter chapter 2, he wrote the believers just like us.
[time=2953] He wrote the believers part of the Church of Jesus Christ in 1 Peter chapter 2.
[time=2959] He says, "As you come to him, the living stone, you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a what?
[time=2969] A royal holy priesthood." You, because of the blood of Christ, are related to God in such a way that you are a part of a holy priesthood.
[time=2981] People who have access to God without the blood of a lamb or a dove, we don't have to come with that sacrifice anymore.
[time=2989] Jesus Christ offered himself as the Lamb of God for our sin.
[time=2994] And so we have the access that these priests enjoyed.
[time=2998] We come to him as a part of a holy priesthood, verse number 9.
[time=3002] You're a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation of people belonging to God.
[time=3011] Some comparisons with the priesthood of the present and the priesthood of the past.
[time=3016] Will you notice that there are some similar responsibilities?
[time=3020] We saw back in Leviticus and we saw the broken-down pattern in Malachi that those priests had to offer sacrifices.
[time=3027] Now our sacrifice is different because Jesus Christ was offered as the final Lamb of God, so we no longer offer a sin sacrifice.
[time=3037] But Peter says, we are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[time=3053] We offer sacrifices, don't we?
[time=3056] Paul wrote to the Romans in chapter 12 and he said, "I beseech you to present what?
[time=3061] Your bodies as a living sacrifice acceptable to God through the blood of Christ."
[time=3068] So just like the priests of old, we offer a sacrifice, but it's a spiritual sacrifice, the sacrifice of who we are.
[time=3076] Everything we are.
[time=3078] That's why the writer of the Hebrews can talk about the sacrifice of praise.
[time=3084] That's why Paul can write to the Philippians and talk about offering your gifts and offering your time and your effort.
[time=3091] All of that as a sacrifice to God as a priest would offer.
[time=3097] So we offer sacrifices, but I want you to notice there's another parallel to the priests of old.
[time=3103] Drop down to verse 9 of 1 Peter 2.
[time=3106] You're a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[time=3117] We offer spiritual sacrifices and we declare his praise just like the priests of old.
[time=3124] The priests of old came with the blessing of God to the people and we have the privilege of coming to the people, whether they're the people of God or the people around us.
[time=3133] And quote declaring the praise of him who called us from darkness into light.
[time=3139] What a privilege.
[time=3141] What an opportunity.
[time=3142] What a possibility.
[time=3144] To stand before our world and declare the praise of the one who brought us out of the darkness into the light of his own presence.
[time=3152] We have similar responsibility.
[time=3155] There's some similar requirements to those priests need to walk with God listen to how Peter spells it out.
[time=3163] He says things like chapter 1 verse 13 prepare your minds for action be self controlled set your hope on the grace given to you.
[time=3171] He says in verse 22, purify yourselves by obeying the truth.
[time=3182] Crave spiritual milk to grow up.
[time=3184] And he says in chapter 3 and on through this text submit and live in harmony and be simple.
[time=3190] He said there are plenty of requirements on the believer priest to what?
[time=3195] To walk with God.
[time=3197] To walk with God in peace and integrity and righteousness.
[time=3203] There are similar responsibilities to offer spiritual sacrifices and declare his praise.
[time=3208] There are similar requirements to walk with God and there's a similar relationship.
[time=3213] Remember the words of Malachi?
[time=3215] My covenant.
[time=3216] My covenant that I have made with this people with this family a covenant not just legal but a relationship.
[time=3222] And when he writes to the believers he said you are built into a spiritual house.
[time=3230] You are coming together as a people being drawn together into a house of believers living stones acceptable to God through Christ Jesus.
[time=3246] And he says that stone is a precious stone, you're a royal people verse 10 you weren't once a people but now you are the people you you once did not have mercy but now you do.
[time=3258] Oh we're not just people that God's added to a list.
[time=3263] We're not just names or numbers on the great computer of heaven.
[time=3268] The Lamb's book of life isn't just a list of names.
[time=3273] We're children of God.
[time=3275] You know, joint heirs with Jesus Christ.
[time=3278] A chosen people pulled together into a family that's a holy royal priesthood.
[time=3285] A people who have access to our God.
[time=3290] You see priest in the New Testament is a family word far more than it's a professional word.
[time=3296] He's not just giving us a job to do.
[time=3299] He's made us his own.
[time=3302] He said I shed my blood.
[time=3305] The blood of the precious Son of God was shed.
[time=3308] The blood that goes far beyond silver or gold.
[time=3311] It was shed to bring you into my family that you might offer spiritual sacrifices and that you might reflect the light that I have given to you.
[time=3324] The learning as we've come together in this church we may need a pastor here but we've got a lot of believer priests don't we?
[time=3334] We've got a lot in the family of God who was he's touched by his grace and given as the privilege of being representatives of his.
[time=3343] And as such just like the priests of old we need to stick together.
[time=3348] We need to encourage each other.
[time=3350] We need to intercede for each other.
[time=3353] We need to stimulate each other.
[time=3355] I don't understand why one priest back there in Malachi's day didn't say to the others.
[time=3360] What's gone wrong?
[time=3361] What happened?
[time=3362] We stopped walking with God.
[time=3364] Let's get back.
[time=3365] We need to do that to each other.
[time=3368] But most of all we need to do the work of the priesthood.
[time=3373] We need to offer spiritual sacrifices.
[time=3376] Sacrifices of ourself and everything we are they're acceptable to God.
[time=3381] And we need to declare the praise of him who called us from darkness into light.
[time=3387] That others may know him and be turned from their sin.
[time=3391] Listen my friend, are you up to it?
[time=3394] Are you ready for it?
[time=3396] The priests of Malachi's day weren't.
[time=3399] Are you?
[time=3400] This admonition you see is for you, old priests.
[time=3406] Gracious Father, I don't know where to start in saying thank you.
[time=3415] We're so grateful this morning when we came to church.
[time=3419] We did not have to bring with us a sin sacrifice.
[time=3424] We didn't have to bring an animal and watch its blood being shed for our sins because there was a day centuries ago when the Lamb of God shed his blood for our sin.
[time=3435] We trusted his sacrifice.
[time=3437] We trusted him.
[time=3439] We've claimed that forgiveness and now Heavenly Father.
[time=3442] You've said because we're related to you in that way you have become a part of my family.
[time=3447] Part of a royal holy priesthood.
[time=3451] What a possibility.
[time=3453] What potential?
[time=3455] Oh God, help us to walk with you.
[time=3459] To walk with you in integrity and peace and uprightness.
[time=3463] Give us that privilege of turning people from their sin and declaring the wonderful praise of him who called us from darkness into light.
[time=3474] Thank you.
[time=3476] Thank you in Jesus name.
[time=3479] [AMEN]
