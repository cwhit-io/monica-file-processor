[time=120] Today many of us find ourselves preoccupied with thoughts of war, and along with the anxiety
[time=131] that goes along with that thinking, there's also a sense of comfort and peace because we know that war is happening in other parts of the world.
[time=139] But just as real as that war is, there's another war that's even more real.
[time=142] It's a spiritual conflict that we're all involved in, and today we want to look at scripture to see what kind of helps we can have in the daily fight in the spiritual battle as we
[time=152] consider our war with the world.
[time=155] (music playing) Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=173] Thank you for joining us.
[time=175] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Tim Teder.
[time=178] Tim's message is entitled "The War with the World." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=186] Special music today includes an instrumental solo from Dave Johnson, a song from Reflection,
[time=195] and a solo from Brian Losen.
[time=199] We now join our service as the sanctuary choir brings us a song entitled "The Majesty and
[time=205] Glory of Your Name."
[time=235] (music playing)
[time=265] (music playing) (music playing) (music playing)
[time=297] (music playing)
[time=452] (music playing) (music playing) (music playing)
[time=487] The Majesty and Glory of Your Name.
[time=490] When we all get to Heaven, that'll be a day of rejoicing when we bow before the name of Jesus.
[time=495] Call Him "Wonderful Counselor." Mighty God, the Prince of Peace, the everlasting Father.
[time=501] Glory to that name, Him number 527.
[time=505] We'll sing together verses 1, 3, and 4 of 100 of 527.
[time=511] (music playing)
[time=537] (music playing) (music playing)
[time=557] (music playing)
[time=631] Thank you very much for your good singing and the blessings we receive as we sing together the glories of our Savior's Name.
[time=639] Continue now with music as David Johnson comes to minister to us, he plays "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing."
[time=646] When he played it in the first hour, there's a part that goes, "Tune Thy heart to sing my praise."
[time=652] And as Dave plays, he is in tune, he has a wonderful ability to play that instrument.
[time=657] And then that's the way our heart should be as we can work and we can function more effectively when our hearts are truly in tune with our Heavenly Father.
[time=666] Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing.
[time=669] (music playing)
[time=920] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today. I'm really glad that you tuned in.
[time=924] If you've been watching us for a number of months, you know that we don't have a senior pastor.
[time=928] But we've been very pleased with the special guests that we've had as well as the music that's been an inspiration to our hearts.
[time=934] I want to tell you about a group that's coming to Blackhawk Baptist Church on Sunday evening, February 24th.
[time=941] From Taylor University, we'll be having the Taylor Sounds, a group of about 12 men and women that sing contemporary music as well as some of the classics.
[time=950] They're directed by the Chairman of the Music Department, Dr. Geiger.
[time=953] I hope that you'll set that evening aside to hear the Taylor Sounds.
[time=957] Once again, that's February 24th, the Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Blackhawk Baptist Church will be hosting Taylor Sounds.
[time=966] Well, as I said, we've had a number of guests speaking with us, and today I have as my special guest and friend Tim Teder in the studio today.
[time=975] Good morning, Tim. Tim, you're going to be speaking for the next three weeks, and I'm looking forward to that.
[time=980] Why don't you tell us a little bit about the series that you have for us?
[time=983] Well, the Bible tells us that our Christian life is more than like a warfare, it is warfare.
[time=988] And so I want to spend the next three weeks just considering what kind of helps we can have in our battle against the world, what the Bible calls the flesh, and the spiritual forces around us.
[time=998] Sounds like an exciting three weeks, and I hope that everyone stays tuned all three weeks for that.
[time=1004] Tim, you're very active with our young people here at the Church, and in particular, Turnpoint Ministries.
[time=1009] We have a little bit of time here, and I want you to tell us a little bit about that ministry.
[time=1014] Well, we do a number of different things in our youth ministry, a number of different areas that we reach into.
[time=1020] In fact, one of our high school students, Mark Archer, put together a short video clip that highlights some of these different areas.
[time=1027] Well, I think it'd be very appropriate right now for not only me to see what happens in the program, but our viewers.
[time=1032] So let's just take a look here at the monitor and see what your young people do during Turnpoint Ministries.
[time=1038] Solomon once prayed that the hearts of the people would be turned towards God to follow after Him.
[time=1047] The purpose of Turnpoint Youth Ministries is to build a youth group in which God will turn the hearts of students to love Him and to change their world for Him.
[time=1055] Of course, we do a lot of the typical youth things in our youth ministry. Sometimes we just get a little bit crazy in some of our events and activities.
[time=1063] I hope we always keep our focus in mind. We exist to change lives for God.
[time=1077] One of the ways we try to do this is during our Sunday morning youth hour.
[time=1081] Each Sunday at 10.50 a.m. students make their way into the gym and we have an hour and ten minutes of discussing and dealing with issues that especially are significant for teenagers.
[time=1091] Sometimes it's through a special speaker, sometimes through guest musicians that come in, but often just breaking into small groups to discuss the topics that are relevant to them.
[time=1100] One of the events that we especially look forward to each year is called Operation Outreach.
[time=1104] So during the spring break the students have and sophomores through seniors travel down to Florida and spend their spring break talking to people on the beach, sharing with them the difference that Jesus Christ has made in their life.
[time=1116] One area of youth ministry that I especially enjoy is what we call servant team.
[time=1120] It's a group of high school students that get together with a mindset especially towards a ministry, ministry of discipleship, ministry of service, ministry of prayer.
[time=1130] We realize that teenagers face all kinds of pressures today and we don't want our youth ministry to be just another pressure in their life, not even a good pressure.
[time=1139] We want them to know power, the power that can change a life, the power that can turn a heart towards God.
[time=1148] Tim, I'm grateful for this outreach ministry of Turn Point.
[time=1152] I know with my own boy he's just involved and really it's a great place for kids not only to have excitement and have fun with each other, but to have an inspirational experience too.
[time=1163] I'm sure that's needed with young people today.
[time=1166] Thanks Pete.
[time=1168] We have been concerned about the war and the Gulf and we have been praying faithfully for all of the men there and in particular many of the young men and women that are associated with Black Hawk Baptist Church and even the Bible Hour.
[time=1181] And we've been praying in our services and in our staff meetings that God will direct and guide and protect these men and women.
[time=1188] And to help us remember them, I'd like to introduce you to a picture that was drawn by one of our own people at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1196] It's a picture of a soldier and the Lord's hand is over his shoulder and we've used the verse from Psalm 119-114.
[time=1204] The Lord is my shield, I will hope in thee. This picture has been copied and prints are available.
[time=1212] If you'd like to receive a copy of this, you can send $10 or more to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1224] This is an 11 and a half by 14 print. It's suitable for framing. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to send for one of these prints that you can more and prayerfully remember our young people that are in the Gulf fighting for our country.
[time=1238] Once again, I want to give you that address. It's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1250] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our service and we'll listen to the reflection as they minister and song to us and then the message from our associate youth pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=1280] "The covenant with the most high dwelled, and only lie breathed, but enter their ears to wander up a separate place, or at all meant the sea."
[time=1305] But the veil was raised in an instant, revealing that holy place.
[time=1315] On a healthier path.
[time=1318] On a rugged cross, justice met grace.
[time=1325] Now I can go.
[time=1330] Into the holy of Holies, I can be here.
[time=1338] And make my petition now.
[time=1342] I can go.
[time=1347] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1351] And although I'm just a common man, because of God's retention plan, I can go.
[time=1361] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1372] The blood of sacrifice ends, is no more required.
[time=1380] For the blood of Christ, the spotless man, who freely made the prize.
[time=1388] And the sacrifice of worship will open heaven's door.
[time=1398] Now I can go.
[time=1405] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1415] I can be here.
[time=1420] And make my petition now.
[time=1424] I can go.
[time=1428] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1433] And although I'm just a common man, because of God's retention plan, I can go.
[time=1443] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1453] I can go.
[time=1458] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1463] And it's me I can be here.
[time=1466] And make my petition now.
[time=1470] I can go.
[time=1474] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1478] And although I'm just a common man, because of God's retention plan, I can go.
[time=1488] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1499] And although I'm just a common man, I can go.
[time=1509] I can go.
[time=1514] Into the holy of Holies.
[time=1526] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1533] Did you pray with me?
[time=1536] Our God, our Father, it is because of Jesus Christ.
[time=1541] And in His name that we can't approach your throne.
[time=1545] It's because on that cross your justice and your grace met.
[time=1551] That we can come and walk to the throne of the Almighty Holy Creator and talk to you.
[time=1560] Thank you for that privilege.
[time=1563] God in our own congregation, our own body of believers, there are so many concerns and hurts and needs.
[time=1568] You know what they all are.
[time=1570] This morning especially if Pam Hayden, the loss of her mother this past week, and ask that you be her comfort or strength.
[time=1578] God that you use her life as a ministry to her father, to friends and family.
[time=1585] How do I think of little Audra, Richard?
[time=1587] Thank you that things have progressed in her life.
[time=1590] But I ask that you continue to give a knowledge and wisdom to those doctors who are working to discover all that's complicating her body.
[time=1598] God, they will have understanding.
[time=1601] They will know what to do.
[time=1603] Lord, we continue to lift up the Hindu family to you.
[time=1608] Lord, again, I thank you for Greg.
[time=1611] You knit him together.
[time=1612] You made him a young man that had strong body.
[time=1616] More importantly, you made him a young man of character, of devotion to you.
[time=1621] And Lord, I know that now you have the ability to put all the wrongness,
[time=1627] all the things that are attacking his health.
[time=1630] You can make that right.
[time=1632] We don't know what you'll do, God.
[time=1634] But we ask that you bring health to him.
[time=1637] More importantly, Lord, we ask that you be honored, that you be glorified, and that you give he and his family strength.
[time=1645] Thank you for the opportunity to talk to you for listening.
[time=1648] [AMEN]
[time=1657] You said you'd come to share all my sorrows.
[time=1678] You said you'd be there for all my tomorrows.
[time=1686] I came so close to sending you away.
[time=1696] And just like you promised, you came there to stay.
[time=1707] I just had to pray.
[time=1717] And Jesus said come to the water, stand by my side.
[time=1728] I know you are thirsty.
[time=1733] You won't be denied.
[time=1739] I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried.
[time=1752] And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died.
[time=1768] Jesus, I give you my heart and my soul.
[time=1779] I know now, without God, I'd never be whole.
[time=1789] Saviour, you open all the right doors.
[time=1798] And I thank you and I praise you from earth's humble shores.
[time=1810] Take me from yours.
[time=1818] And Jesus said come to the water, stand by my side.
[time=1829] I know you are thirsty.
[time=1834] You won't be denied.
[time=1841] I felt every teardrop when in darkness you cried.
[time=1854] And I strove to remind you that for those tears I died.
[time=1901] Thank you, Brian.
[time=1909] Would you take your Bibles turn to the fourth chapter of the book of James?
[time=1916] James chapter four.
[time=1919] Wednesday, January 16th, I was sitting in my home watching the evening news, seeing what the events of the world might be.
[time=1929] All of a sudden, Peter Jennings and ABC interrupted the normal news cast to go to his correspondent and Baghdad.
[time=1938] Gary Shepard began describing the firework of display over the city of Baghdad as the Iraqis launched their weapons against the incoming forces, the Allied forces.
[time=1952] The fire had begun and my attention was drawn to that television as I heard the events unfolding.
[time=1960] That night I remember as I would normally make my way to the church to meet with the senior hires and we'd have a time of Bible study and discussion.
[time=1968] That particular night I packed up my small TV and brought it to church because I knew the mind of the students where they would be as we got together.
[time=1975] And sure enough, it's like, hey, men, did you hear? Did you hear the war started? And we put the TV up and watched it for about 15, 20 minutes.
[time=1983] Then talked about it, prayed, a lot of emotion even among some of us displayed that night because war is a reality.
[time=1991] And for some of you, it's very, very real because you have friends, perhaps family involved in the Persian Gulf and the conflict there.
[time=1997] But as real as that war is and as close as we may feel to that conflict, there is a war that is more real.
[time=2010] I'm talking about the spiritual warfare, a conflict that's gone on since before the beginning of our time.
[time=2017] We're involved in a cosmic conflict, a spiritual warfare, and each one of us today are part of that war in one way or another.
[time=2027] And I want to spend the next few weeks talking about the war, specifically talking about those three enemies that are often identified, the enemy of the world, the flesh and the devil.
[time=2037] And so I would like to speak on our war with the world, the war within us, and then the war with spiritual forces.
[time=2046] This morning considering the war with the world.
[time=2049] James chapter 4, this group of Christians had a number of hindrances in the warfare, things that kept them from being effective in the spiritual conflict.
[time=2060] Beginning at verse 1, what causes fights and quarrels among you?
[time=2063] Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?
[time=2066] You want something but don't get it.
[time=2068] You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want.
[time=2071] You quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God, and when you do ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives.
[time=2079] That you may spend what you get on your pleasures. Now pay attention to verse 4.
[time=2083] You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God?
[time=2089] Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
[time=2095] These Christians had some things that hindered them in the warfare, specifically let me mention 3.
[time=2101] They had a confused purpose, a compromised unity, conflicting loyalty.
[time=2105] Just touching on the first two, they had a confused purpose.
[time=2108] James describes this in the phrases, he says in verse 1, that you have these desires that are at battle within you.
[time=2117] There's a conflict going on.
[time=2119] Verse 2, he talks about them wanting something.
[time=2121] You cannot have what you want. In verse 3, he talks about the wrong motives that are at play in their hearts.
[time=2127] See, a good soldier has to have a purpose, and the Christian's purpose is to know, to love, to serve God.
[time=2134] And these Christians, their purpose had changed.
[time=2137] In warfare, a good soldier needs a purpose.
[time=2140] It might be an ideal, it might be a particular commander they follow, it might be a goal, we need a purpose.
[time=2148] And that is one of our strategies in the current warfare, so United States War and Iraq,
[time=2156] is to try to diminish the purpose, to diminish the resolve and the motive of the Iraqi soldiers.
[time=2164] And these Christians were hindered in their war because of their confused purpose, also because of compromised unity.
[time=2172] They had fights and quarrels among them. There is strength in unity.
[time=2178] Saddam knows that.
[time=2181] Mr. Hussein's strategy, one of his strategies is to try to divide the coalition,
[time=2187] to try to break apart the different countries and governments that make up the Allied force.
[time=2193] He knows if he can do that, it's going to weaken the Allied forces.
[time=2198] Because there's strength in unity, and Satan knows the same strategy.
[time=2202] He knows that if he can get us as believers to be divided, then he is one of battle.
[time=2208] If he can break apart, he can mess up with our unity, then he's one of skirmish, he's one of battle.
[time=2215] He's gained a victory in that regard.
[time=2217] And so he'll try to bring quarrels and fights among us as Christians and believers, the body of this church,
[time=2224] and also between us and other churches.
[time=2228] We separate from certain bodies of believers because of issues and things that may not be that important.
[time=2235] Sometimes they are, but oftentimes they're not.
[time=2237] There's even what's called second-degree separation, or third-degree separation, depending on how far you want to go.
[time=2244] And that simply means that we as a church can associate with the church down the street, because they had someone come and speak in their pulpit who at one time was preaching alongside someone else who has doctrinal differences with us.
[time=2257] And it gets ridiculous.
[time=2259] And I'm sure Satan loves it when that kind of separation occurs, because there is strength in unity and separation as a hindrance in the warfare.
[time=2268] We're to be united.
[time=2269] But the one I want to focus attention on is the hindrance of conflicting loyalty, as we see in verse 4.
[time=2277] These Christians had a problem.
[time=2280] They were to be loyal to God, and yet it appears some of them were having another different loyalty.
[time=2288] The conflict here is between God and the world, between godliness and worldliness.
[time=2294] Now, we need to understand the biblical meaning when the Bible talks about the world.
[time=2298] What is it referring to?
[time=2300] Well, sometimes in the Bible refers to the world, it's talking about the planet Earth.
[time=2304] It says in Psalm 24, verse 1, that the Earth and everything in it belongs to the world, the people and all the people who dwell in it.
[time=2313] The world is talking about the physical planet Earth.
[time=2316] Sometimes the Bible talks about the world.
[time=2318] It's referring to the humanity of the world, the people of the Earth.
[time=2323] John 3, 16, for God so loved the world.
[time=2326] He's not talking about the dirt, the physical planet.
[time=2328] He's talking about the people of the world.
[time=2330] But in James 4 and verse 4, the world takes on this meaning.
[time=2335] It refers to the human system that stands opposed to God.
[time=2340] It refers to the human system of values, goals, lifestyle that are in opposition to what God would want for our lives.
[time=2350] That's the world that James is talking about.
[time=2353] It's the same world that John refers to when in 1 John chapter 2, he tells us not to love the world or anything in the world.
[time=2361] If he loves the world, if we love the world, the love of the Father is not in us.
[time=2366] That's worldliness.
[time=2368] I suppose if we could put it in just common terms, I think Warren Wiers be said it this way.
[time=2373] Worldliness is anything that we love or do, anything that we love or do that keeps us from loving God or doing what he wills for our life.
[time=2385] Now that means something that is really not bad in itself can become worldliness to us when it takes the place of me loving God or doing what God wants me to do.
[time=2395] It becomes more important in my life.
[time=2398] Worldliness, human system of values, goals and lifestyle which is opposed to God.
[time=2404] In this chapter we see that worldliness is an offense to God.
[time=2408] It's a very serious offense.
[time=2410] Look at the three descriptions James uses in verse 4 when he describes a friend of the world.
[time=2415] He says, "You adulterous people." And the word there that is translated, "You adulterous people" is actually a noun in the feminine form.
[time=2423] What James is saying is, "You adulterous is." "You adulterous is." Very strong language.
[time=2430] And I believe what James is saying is, "Don't you know you're the bride of Christ.
[time=2433] You are the bride of Christ." What are you doing sleeping with the enemy?
[time=2440] He refers to them to a friend of the world as a God-hater.
[time=2445] Now that seems strong.
[time=2446] I mean I don't like to, I wouldn't want to think of myself as a God-hater.
[time=2449] I mean I might enjoy a little things of the world, maybe beyond what I should, but I don't hate God.
[time=2455] And yet Jesus said himself and Matthew, "That you can't serve two masters.
[time=2459] You can't have a loyalty to two opposing masters.
[time=2462] You will love the one and hate the other, or you will despise the one and be committed to the other."
[time=2469] But you can't have it both ways.
[time=2471] James says to be a friend of the world, is to be an enemy of God.
[time=2474] And he also says to be a God-hater and an enemy of God is the third phrase.
[time=2479] Very strong language to show us the seriousness of buying into this world system that stands
[time=2487] in opposition to what God desires and what He wants for us.
[time=2491] Now there are a number of ways that we could characterize worldliness.
[time=2494] I want to do it in three descriptions.
[time=2498] Worldliness is characterized, first of all, by a desire to do what pleases me rather than what pleases God.
[time=2505] A desire to do what pleases me rather than what pleases God.
[time=2509] I enjoy focusing on me.
[time=2512] I like doing something because it pleases me, but the question is, does it please God?
[time=2519] I like pursuing a particular activity or a particular relationship because it makes me feel good,
[time=2525] but the question is, does it make God feel good?
[time=2529] I remember in my youth mystery a number of years ago a box office hit came into the theaters, and it was a comedy, and everyone was going to see it, but I knew something of it by hearing the interviews,
[time=2540] reading the reviews, and hearing comments coming out about the movie.
[time=2543] I knew that even though there was a lot of humor in it, there was a lot of foulness too.
[time=2547] Both in the language and in the scenes that were included in the movie, so it was a little bit of a bother to me when some of the students in my youth group began talking about the movie and laughing about some of the things that were in it.
[time=2560] I simply just talked with them and asked them about it.
[time=2562] I remember asking one student, I said, "What about these things I've heard about?
[time=2565] Is this true?" "Oh, yeah, well, that's in there quite a bit.
[time=2568] What about these kinds of scenes?" Well, those are in there too, but he stopped and he said, "But you know what?
[time=2574] That might bother other people, but I can handle it because it doesn't bother me." I just asked him, "But does it bother God?"
[time=2585] You know, that's the question. Does it bother God?
[time=2588] I mean, it doesn't matter really if it bothers me or not.
[time=2591] I mean, I can become immune to a lot of things.
[time=2593] I can get to the point where there's a lot of things that don't bother me anymore, but does it bother God?
[time=2599] If it bothers God, then it has no place in my life.
[time=2603] It should have no place in my life.
[time=2605] Does it bother me? See, worldliness means we focus on me.
[time=2609] I focus on me to the neglect of what pleases God.
[time=2612] We need to learn the lesson from Ecclesiastes.
[time=2614] Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, searched through all the things that the world has to offer to find fulfillment and pleasure.
[time=2620] And you know what its conclusion was? It's all meaningless.
[time=2623] It's all meaningless. It's temporary. It doesn't last.
[time=2626] It doesn't bring ultimate fulfillment.
[time=2628] And when he came to the conclusion of everything at the end of Ecclesiastes, chapter 12, verse 13, he said this, "Now all has been heard. Here is the conclusion of the matter.
[time=2637] Fear God and keep His commandments for this is the whole duty of man." You know what Solomon realized? That pleasing me is meaningless.
[time=2646] Pleasing God is what has purpose in life.
[time=2651] Worldliness is characterized by a desire to do what pleases me rather than what pleases God.
[time=2654] It's also characterized by a focus on temporary things rather than on eternal things.
[time=2660] You know, things in our life can choke away our spiritual life, our spiritual energy.
[time=2667] Things aren't bad. Things aren't necessarily wrong.
[time=2671] But things can be the thing that choke spiritual life out of us.
[time=2675] Jesus was talking about this when he told a parable.
[time=2678] And he compared the Word of God to a seed and how the seed is thrown on different kinds of soil.
[time=2683] And one of the kinds of soil was it was thrown on soil that had a lot of thorns in it.
[time=2687] And Jesus said when the seed is thrown in there it begins to spring up.
[time=2690] But the thorns just choke the life out of the plant.
[time=2693] And it can't get the nourishment because all the thorns are in the way.
[time=2697] And it dies. Withers away.
[time=2700] And he goes on to explain to his disciples what this parable means.
[time=2703] He says in Matthew 13, 22, he said, "The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the person who hears the Word.
[time=2710] But the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful."
[time=2717] He's talking about worldliness there.
[time=2719] The concerns of the world can choke things.
[time=2724] Can choke our spirit. We buy into it.
[time=2727] We may go to school. We may go to college. We may get a degree.
[time=2732] But somewhere in the course of our life many of us will step out into the real world and we begin buying things.
[time=2738] And oftentimes the first things we begin buying we really can't afford them.
[time=2742] And we're in debt. And we spend the rest of our life accumulating more things and working harder to pay off the debt for the things that we've accumulated.
[time=2750] And it's just an endless cycle. And pretty soon the things that we bought back then begin breaking down and need to be replaced. And we're just in a constant turmoil.
[time=2757] What? It saps our energy. It saps our life because we have to spend the focus of our life on things.
[time=2764] And I don't believe that's the way God ever intended it to be.
[time=2767] But we've bought into it. That's what the world tells us.
[time=2772] Worldliness means I focus on temporary things and I lose focus of eternal things.
[time=2777] Things can trap me. You've probably heard the story.
[time=2780] How they catch monkeys. The Caribbean.
[time=2783] They take a coconut and they hollow it out and they put a hole in it.
[time=2788] It's just large enough for a monkey to slip his hand through.
[time=2791] Then they'll anchor that coconut onto a tree so it can't be removed.
[time=2794] And inside the hole of that hollowed out coconut, they'll drop some peanuts.
[time=2797] And a monkey comes along, sees this coconut, goes up the coconut, looks in the hole, sees these peanuts.
[time=2801] They look good to him. He slips his hand through the hole and grabs the peanut.
[time=2805] And he can't get his hand out. He's holding onto those peanuts.
[time=2809] You know, the interesting thing is the monkey won't let go.
[time=2812] People can come up and bop the monkey on the head and he just keeps holding onto those peanuts.
[time=2816] And that's what things can become in our life.
[time=2819] They become something we don't let go of and we're trapped.
[time=2824] We don't have the freedom and the kind of life God wants us to live because we're holding on to things.
[time=2829] Well, third characteristic of worldliness.
[time=2833] Worldliness is characterized by reliance on society standards rather than on the standards of scripture.
[time=2840] When I'm evaluating what's right and wrong, if I look at what society accepts and rejects as my standard,
[time=2847] I become worldly because that is oftentimes opposed to what God says is right and what's wrong.
[time=2855] We have a conflict when it comes to this because obviously we're here on earth. What do we do?
[time=2859] Do we retreat from the world? Do we go on hide in our own, you know, walled cities as Christians
[time=2865] and try to get away from worldliness? Well, obviously that's not the answer.
[time=2868] Jesus said we're salt and light of the earth. We're supposed to be here in the world to have our effect on the world.
[time=2875] Some say, well, we need to get away from ungodly influence.
[time=2879] We need to remove ourselves from the influence of non-Christians.
[time=2883] And so we think that avoiding sin means that we stay away from sinners.
[time=2887] But Jesus didn't do that. And Paul's very clear in 1 Corinthians 5 to warn us.
[time=2892] He says, listen, when I'm telling you to remove yourself from sinfulness, I'm telling you that for the person that calls himself a Christian and yet continues in disobedience have nothing to do with them.
[time=2901] But for those who are outside the church, for those who are unbelievers, you're to be in the world.
[time=2906] You're supposed to be having an effect. We maintain those relationships.
[time=2911] The right response and a phrase we hear many times is that we're to be in the world but not of the world.
[time=2917] Jesus praying for His disciples in John chapter 17 said, Father, hear the ones you've given me.
[time=2925] And I'm not praying. I'm not asking you to take them out of the world, but I'm asking you to protect them.
[time=2930] Keep them from the evil one.
[time=2933] For God, they are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
[time=2938] We are in the world, but we are not of the world. We're strangers here.
[time=2942] Really in a real sense. We're aliens. We're foreigners. We're visitors.
[time=2947] Our home isn't here. Our home's yet to come.
[time=2952] But where do we put all our focus?
[time=2955] We hold on to this as home. We're to be in the world, but not of the world.
[time=2961] When I lived in Fort Wayne, excuse me, when I lived in Michigan and Grand Ledge Michigan, and we knew we were going to be leaving and coming to Fort Wayne, this was going to be where we would live.
[time=2970] You know, my perspective changed. We lived in a double-wide mobile home for quite a few years.
[time=2976] And boy, there were crooked walls in that mobile home.
[time=2980] There were doors that hung crooked, and that used to bother me.
[time=2984] I'd come in and see these big gaps that weren't even even along the doorways.
[time=2988] They'd be narrow here and wide here, and I'd want to get some of that stuff fixed.
[time=2992] But as soon as I knew that my home wasn't going to be in Grand Ledge anymore, that I knew I was moving to Fort Wayne, this was going to be my home.
[time=2997] My perspective changed. I didn't care that much.
[time=2999] You know, things that I seemed, that needs to be fixed and that needs to be changed.
[time=3003] It just bugs me. I wasn't that big of a deal anymore.
[time=3006] Because this was my home that I was coming to. That was just temporary.
[time=3011] And I think in the same way, our perspective changed is when we began to realize that heaven,
[time=3018] that being with God, that's where our home is.
[time=3021] It's a hard struggle. It's a hard struggle.
[time=3025] When we think of the difference between society's values and scripture's values, there comes the question of Christianity and culture.
[time=3034] By culture, I mean the patterns of behavior that characterize different societies.
[time=3038] How is a Christian supposed to live in a particular culture?
[time=3042] In what ways should I be different as a Christian from my culture?
[time=3047] In what ways should my Christian values incorporate cultural values?
[time=3054] In what ways do Christianity and culture blend together naturally?
[time=3058] In what ways do they conflict?
[time=3060] Sometimes those are hard questions to answer.
[time=3063] I know this though. I know we have a tendency to focus on one side of the issue many times.
[time=3071] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9, he says, "I've become all things to all men."
[time=3077] And you read the context of that and Paul is saying, "When I go into a different culture to proclaim the gospel, I adopt that culture as my lifestyle so that I can be more effective in proclaiming Christ."
[time=3088] The only thing that Hudson Taylor did when he went to China, instead of keeping the clothes of his culture, he adopted the clothes and the hairstyle, the long ponytail of the Chinese people, so that that wasn't the barrier. The gospel was the important thing.
[time=3105] That's what Paul did, and that's one side of the issue.
[time=3107] The other side, and Paul warns the Romans, he says, "Hey, don't be conformed to the pattern of this world." Both of those are true.
[time=3116] We don't focus on one another, but somehow there's a balance in the middle.
[time=3120] We have a tendency to judge culture through personal bias.
[time=3124] We look at the things around us, and we tend to judge things on the basis of what we've come to be comfortable with, what we accept.
[time=3131] And if we're not comfortable with it, then it's wrong.
[time=3134] If we can't accept it because of our background, then it becomes wrong.
[time=3138] When maybe it really isn't. We judge culture through our own personal bias.
[time=3142] You know what, culture is an absolute. Truth is, morality is, but culture is not.
[time=3146] Culture changes. Culture changes with location.
[time=3151] Now, it used to be a problem for missionaries, maybe it's to some degree, but I think we've gotten much better at it.
[time=3156] American missionaries would many times go to different cultures, and they had so infused their culture with their Christianity, the American missionaries, that when they went to another place, another country, and they began sharing Christ, they felt it necessary to teach that culture American ways.
[time=3177] You know, these people need to start dressing like Americans dress. That's Christian.
[time=3181] These people need to start singing American choruses and hymns. That's Christian.
[time=3186] These people need to start adapting some of our lifestyle and our customs, because that's Christian. That's not Christianity. That's culture.
[time=3194] We need to distinguish between the two. If we're going to separate from worldliness, we need to be able to see what it really is that's important to be separated from and what it's not. And I'm just suggesting that many of the things that bother us are more cultural, culturally related than are really issues of moral rightness or wrongness.
[time=3213] Culture changes. Culture changes over time.
[time=3217] A question that's been dealt with over and over again is what is it appropriate for a woman to wear?
[time=3222] In the 1950s, should a woman wear makeup?
[time=3226] A lot of people felt if you weren't a Christian, a woman should not wear makeup.
[time=3230] In the '60s, the issue was how short can a skirt be before it's inappropriate?
[time=3234] In the '70s, it was can women wear slacks?
[time=3238] Is that a moral issue? In culture, we define things differently as time change. The issue of how long or what kind of style can a man's hair be before it becomes wrong?
[time=3250] Do you remember watching the Ed Sullivan Show? Some of you, I remember seeing it in the '60s when the Beatles came on, this weird group, and their hair was so long, you know? Now you look at the pictures and it's conservative. But in the '60s, if hair was over your ears, it was inappropriate. It was sinned. Many churches.
[time=3270] In the '70s, it was over your shoulders it was sinned. And the '80s, if it was too short, it was rebellion. And now I guess it's just how many lines and patterns you can work in there is maybe the thing. All I'm saying is that culture changes. That can't be the measure of morality.
[time=3286] What's appropriate music in the church?
[time=3290] This always gets somebody mad when I say this. I just wanted to show you how time changes even culture. In the '1500s, Martin Luther borrowed some popular bar tunes and put Christian words to him and it offended many of the Christian leaders of his day. And yet some of these songs like "A Mighty Fortresses Are God" and "A Way in a Major" become hymns of today. In the 1700s, there was an opposition to a new and ominous menace in the church. And it was the hymns singing by congregation. Something that was considered worldly by some people. In the 1800s, controversy surrounded the use of choirs and of organs in the church.
[time=3330] Not too long ago, the conflict, the controversy surrounded the use of taped music, soundtracks as being worldly.
[time=3338] And now many times we'll accept a soundtrack with a rhythm section in it, but don't bring the drums on stage because that's too worldly. And I would suggest to you that many of the things that we struggle with in the contemporary style of music today in the future is not going to be an issue at all. And all I'm saying is, do we not have any care about these things? I'm not saying that. We need to have a Christian perspective, but what I'm trying to help us understand is that culture changes. Don't let culture, don't let what you're comfortable with be the measure of what is worldly and what is not. Because when we do that, we have another tendency.
[time=3374] We have the tendency to strain at gnats while we swallow camels.
[time=3378] Do you remember that phrase Jesus said to the Pharisees in Matthew? He says to the Pharisees, the religious leaders, those who are defending the fundamentals of the faith in their day. Jesus said, you are straining at gnats and you're swallowing camels. You ever kind of bug in your throat?
[time=3394] It's past week I was drinking a bottle of soft drink. I was talking on the phone and took a swallow.
[time=3398] I got a bug that was a half inch, went down in my throat. Man, I gagged on that. I've been riding a bike and have bug go in your mouth and you know, you just start coughing. Well, Jesus gives that picture of the Pharisees.
[time=3410] Pharisees were the traditionalists. Pharisees were the fundamentalists.
[time=3414] They were protecting the faith. They were protecting it against the liberalism of the sad you sees and yet it was the Pharisees that Jesus condemned because they took the truth that never changed and they started adding on to it. All these lists of things that are right and wrong. They were making a list. They were checking it twice.
[time=3429] They were looking to see who was naughty and nice and judging. And we have a tendency to do the same kind of thing because it's easier, isn't it? Isn't it easier to have a list to tell us what's appropriate and not than to then to kind of leave it up to some differences of opinion among Christians in different areas.
[time=3444] We'd rather have it defined so we know how to judge ourselves and judge other people.
[time=3448] But I suggest to you that the maturity that God gives to us as his children, the freedom from law and regulation that he brings through Jesus Christ means that we don't have to have that same kind of attitude that the Pharisees had.
[time=3462] We need to be careful. We don't strain at gnats and in the process follow swallow camels. Let's go down to the first church on the corner. And there we see Mr. Smith comes every Sunday morning and Sunday night, Wednesday nights too.
[time=3478] He's involved in ministry. You see all the things that he participates in. You say, wow, there is a spiritual guy, but he has a heart of materialism.
[time=3486] His goal in life is to be financially successful.
[time=3490] He has strained at gnats and swallowed the camel.
[time=3494] His offense to God is more serious than the person who misses Wednesday nights. I would suggest to you.
[time=3502] We might see Ms. Jones in the same church. She doesn't smoke, never touched alcohol, wouldn't walk into a movie theater, certainly wouldn't listen to rock music. And considers herself because of these things righteous. And yet she has a heart of bitterness becomes eagerly angered. Gossips talks ill of other people. And she calls it We've been sharing with you today music from our sanctuary choir, the reflection Dave and Debbie Johnson and soloist Brian Losen.
[time=3538] The message today was from our Associate Pastor Tim Teder.
[time=3542] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.

[time=3558] And today I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and make my heart pure and be my Savior today. I ask you to come into my heart.
[time=3566] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
