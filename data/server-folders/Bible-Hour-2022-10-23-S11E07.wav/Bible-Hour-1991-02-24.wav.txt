[time=63] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=119] - In the week that has just passed, we've been away from Fort Wayne, and often when the choir sees me come back after a week back, I'm so excited.
[time=130] Usually I've gone to a music conference, and I want to tell them everything I learned in about 15 minutes, but this time this was a time to visit and also to go to some conferences that were not of a music nature.
[time=143] Three things that stuck out in my mind that I observed this week as I was gone from Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=150] The first one was a young man from Nepal that spoke about the circumstances in his country.
[time=157] If you publicly ascend to the fact that you know Jesus Christ is your personal savior, it's very often that you are put in jail for one year.
[time=167] If you witness to other people publicly, it's very common for them to be put in jail for three years.
[time=173] And if you're baptized publicly, you're often given a six-year jail term for your faith.
[time=180] I think how easy it is in America to witness, and yet we don't do it.
[time=184] And then I heard a man named Valerie who's been in the United States from Russia for nine months with his family.
[time=191] Loves the Lord with all his heart and just wants to us.
[time=206] (silence) The story's told of the reformer Martin Luther
[time=228] that he was so distraught over Satan's bothering of him that one day seated at his desk, he picked up his ink bottle and threw it against the wall at the devil.
[time=237] The devil was real to him.
[time=238] How real is Satan in your life?
[time=240] We've been considering spiritual warfare in the last few weeks.
[time=243] And today we want to take a look at Our War with the Devil.
[time=247] (dramatic music) Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music,
[time=263] and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=265] Thank you for joining us.
[time=267] Speaking today is Associate Pastor Tim Teder.
[time=271] Tim's message is entitled The War with the Devil.
[time=275] His text is taken from the book of First Peter, chapter five, verses eight and nine.
[time=281] Special music includes a solo from Kevin Rowe, a song from Celebration, and a solo from Lynn Rowe.
[time=293] Let's join our service with a song from the Sanctuary Choir entitled, And Can It Be?
[time=299] (dramatic music) [MUSIC - 262 seconds]
[time=572] (audience applauds) (audience applauds)
[time=586] - Thank you, Choir, and Reed,
[time=592] for that great song of victory.
[time=594] Oh, victory in Jesus, him number 473.
[time=598] Him number 473, that song should inspire you to sing, I'm gonna ask you to stand.
[time=604] This song just requires that, please.
[time=607] (audience applauds) [MUSIC - 14 seconds]
[time=628] (singing in foreign language)
[time=808] (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) - Thank you very much.
[time=826] You may be seated.
[time=826] Thank you for that good singing.
[time=828] We'll listen now as we listen to music.
[time=830] The song you put my feet on a solid rock.
[time=834] You remember the scripture verse that said, "The wise men built his house upon the rock, "the foolish man upon the sand." Let's listen to the words of the wise man.
[time=844] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=928] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 130 seconds]
[time=1068] (chimes) Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=1076] I'm so glad that you've tuned in for this final message in a series of three messages from our Associate Pastor Tim Teder.
[time=1084] Speaking of Tim, good morning Tim.
[time=1086] I'm really delighted that you had the opportunity to speak for the last couple of weeks.
[time=1088] I wasn't here last Sunday, but I did watch the Bible Hour by way of tape
[time=1094] and appreciated your ministry and you'll be concluding your series this week.
[time=1098] Tell us a little bit about this message.
[time=1100] Well Pete, I've always enjoyed the chance to be able to study the Word and teach the Word.
[time=1106] And in this series of spiritual warfare has been especially interesting to me again to go back and consider the conflicts that as Christians were involved in.
[time=1114] I think probably too many times as Christians you wonder what makes my life different
[time=1120] from the person out there that doesn't know Christ.
[time=1122] And one of the ways it's different is that we should be aware of the conflict, the spiritual battle that we're a part of.
[time=1128] So I've enjoyed studying that again.
[time=1132] And today we're going to take a look at when we think of our enemy, the first thing that probably comes to mind of most Christians is Satan himself, the devil, we're going to consider that a little bit this morning.
[time=1140] You know Tim, when you're gone, whether it's at a conference or taking some vacation,
[time=1146] there's always some time to do some reading and some observing.
[time=1150] And I can second the motion that we're in a definite warfare.
[time=1154] I want just three observations that I made this week.
[time=1158] I heard a man from Nepal say that if you just are considered a Christian, people know that, there's a possibility that you'll be put in jail for one year.
[time=1168] And if you witness over there, you can be put in jail for three years.
[time=1172] And if you publicly are baptized by immersion, you can get up to six years
[time=1178] in jail for your public testimony.
[time=1180] Imagine trying to be a witness in that area and knowing the consequences.
[time=1184] And although we enjoy and appreciate the freedoms here in America, I think sometimes that causes us to be maybe a little bit laxadaisical
[time=1192] and our attitude towards this battle that we are a part of.
[time=1194] A second man that I met was a man named Valerie.
[time=1198] He has been here in the United States for nine months coming from Russia with his family.
[time=1202] And he prayed a final prayer in a service that I was at in Russian.
[time=1206] And I could just feel the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1210] And as he talked before he prayed, he was just so grateful that he could be in a country that was as free as ours to witness and to serve the Lord.
[time=1218] Boy, he was grateful and it really reminded me, as you've just said, what freedoms we have.
[time=1224] And then finally I read a book entitled Escaping the Coming Night.
[time=1228] And it was on the book of Revelation.
[time=1230] Very enlightening and very inspiring to read that again and be reminded of while we have a very loving God.
[time=1236] There is a day of judgment coming for those that don't love him.
[time=1240] So these are days where we're in a spiritual warfare.
[time=1242] And I hope that you're tuned in to Things of the Lord by going to church and praying, reading God's Word, and being informed of how the last days will be and knowing that you have a Savior.
[time=1254] And it'll keep you from those final days that are going to be days of judgment.
[time=1258] I want to talk to you a little bit about some of the coming speakers that we have.
[time=1262] Next week on March 3rd we'll have Russell Moore.
[time=1266] Russ is from California.
[time=1268] He's the pastor of the Foothill Baptist Church in Sylmar, California.
[time=1270] He's also the Vice President for Student Affairs at Masters College.
[time=1274] A very dynamic young man, a great speaker.
[time=1278] I know that you'll want to stay tuned in and listen to his message next Sunday morning March 3rd.
[time=1284] And then on March 10th we will have Jim Rickard.
[time=1288] And Jim is a financial consultant for a foundation, again out in California.
[time=1292] He's been here before.
[time=1294] He's been here to talk to us about our stewardship, about our giving.
[time=1298] And then we're going to have a special event on that evening, March 10th at about 7 o'clock.
[time=1302] We will have right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church a Will's Seminar.
[time=1306] Tim, I'm amazed at the number of people that don't have wills.
[time=1310] And that's really important as it relates to your own family relationship and how much easier it is for your children to know what's happening.
[time=1318] So that will be a great time.
[time=1320] That's March 10th at 7 p.m.
[time=1322] right here at the worship center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1324] And then looking ahead, it won't be too long before we'll be in the Easter season.
[time=1328] We want to tell you about our Good Friday service.
[time=1332] It's downtown in Fort Wayne at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=1336] And that will be held March 29th right at noon from 1215 to 1245.
[time=1342] A very short service in the ballroom of the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=1346] Everyone's invited to come.
[time=1348] It's a great service.
[time=1348] I hope that you'll set that day to side and come and be with us at that time.
[time=1354] I also want to tell you about our gift offer.
[time=1356] We've been offering for a number of weeks now a print made right here by Lisa Reniker,
[time=1362] one of the members of our church, and we've entitled it The Desert Soldier.
[time=1366] And it's available if you will send us a gift of $10 or more.
[time=1370] It's a print of her drawing.
[time=1372] It's very, very beautiful.
[time=1374] On it, it has the verse from Psalm 119-114 that says, "Thou art my shield.
[time=1380] I will hope in thee." That's a very critical time in the life of our soldiers and in the war.
[time=1386] And we want to be found faithful in praying for them.
[time=1388] I have had one of them framed, and it makes it just a very beautiful picture,
[time=1394] and it also does remind us of our soldiers who are in great conflict right now.
[time=1398] And I hope you're found faithful in praying for them.
[time=1400] Right today for this beautiful print, I'll give you the address right now.
[time=1404] It's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1410] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1412] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1422] We go back now to the live portion of our broadcast, and we look forward to the message from our Associate Pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=1446] [MUSIC - 264 seconds]
[time=1726] Father, this morning we thank you for the agony of the cross,
[time=1732] and how through the blood of your son you bought us, and purchased our salvation.
[time=1740] God, through the cross this morning we ask that you give us the power that we need
[time=1746] to live, the life we've called us to live, and in our hearts you give us the peace that we need in the middle of the battle.
[time=1754] We ask the name of our Redeemer, Jesus, amen.
[time=1760] [MUSIC - 280 seconds]
[time=2046] Thank you, Kevin. I appreciate the time that you've given me the last few Sundays to be able to open the word talk about this area of spiritual warfare, the battle that we're a part of.
[time=2060] We want to look at it again for the third and final Sunday as we consider our war with the devil.
[time=2066] He'll turn to the book of 1 Peter.
[time=2070] The last two weeks we have looked at our war, the spiritual battle as it relates to our war with the world and as it relates to our war with the flesh or the sinful human nature.
[time=2086] We find as Peter writes this letter to believers scattered about what is now known as modern-day Turkey, he reminds them of the same truth.
[time=2098] Looking at the beginning of the letter, first chapter, first verse, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect strangers in the world scattered throughout Pontius, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bethania.
[time=2114] See, he reminds them what we were reminded of when we began considering this battle that we are in the world but not of the world.
[time=2122] And really we can say that we're Christians scattered throughout Fort Wayne, California, Ohio, different countries, different nations, and yet in a real sense, even though we're living in different places in the world, we're just strangers here.
[time=2136] We're just foreigners here.
[time=2138] Our home is somewhere else.
[time=2142] He reminds them of the conflict, the battle that goes on within them too, in that same chapter.
[time=2150] Verse 14, "As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance, but just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do, for it is written, be holy because I am holy."
[time=2162] And we're reminded that when God called us, when God worked to change in our lives, there's a real difference.
[time=2172] Scripture calls it the new creation, and we're dead to things that once were, and yet in a real sense we still carry on some of the habits of our old life, and we will struggle with those things as long as we live here.
[time=2188] It is a battle that goes on, and yet it's a battle that God does, give us victory again through the cross of Jesus Christ.
[time=2194] But today we want to consider our war with the devil, and we'll turn to chapter 5.
[time=2200] A lot of things that we could say in regards to this war.
[time=2204] A lot of things concerning this enemy that could be considered.
[time=2210] What I like to do this morning is just take those things that we can learn from 1 Peter chapter 5 verses 8 and 9.
[time=2216] And there Peter writes, "Be self-controlled and alert.
[time=2220] Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
[time=2224] Resist him, standing firm in the faith because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings."
[time=2234] C.S. Lewis once wrote a book called The Screwtape Letters. It's been a bestseller, a lot of you perhaps have read it.
[time=2246] In the process of the book you get some perception of what strategy of Satan may be.
[time=2254] But in the preface of that book C.S. Lewis makes a statement that has become perhaps more popular than the book itself.
[time=2260] He says, "There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils.
[time=2266] One is to disbelieve in their existence, the other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.
[time=2272] They themselves are equally pleased with both errors.
[time=2276] We need to be careful when we consider Satan and the demons that we don't fall into one of those two traps,
[time=2282] that we don't disbelieve on one hand, and there are those who disbelieve.
[time=2288] Less than a year ago the journalist came out with an issue that spoke to the topic of Satanism.
[time=2296] In the opening paragraph of that issue they stated their belief and pretty much in summary what they stated was that Satanism is alive and well in the United States.
[time=2310] It's alive and well in the minds of fundamentalist Christians and extremists and those people that might be considered mentally unstable who go around talking about the reality of such things.
[time=2324] And that is one danger that we discredit that Satan is real.
[time=2330] On the other hand we need to be careful that we don't give him too much credit, that we don't have excessive interest.
[time=2338] And even in the realm of Christianity in the past years there have been authors who have put out books who have gone on talk shows who have talked about their experiences with Satan and Satanism only to find out later that they in reality are frauds to their own admission.
[time=2352] We need to be careful. Be careful that we don't get too extreme, that we don't start looking for Satan in every little thing, demons behind every little problem that we have.
[time=2362] Remember being in high school and seeing a little comic book that talked about the work of demons.
[time=2366] Remember one picture in that little comic book had a church service as the pastor was preaching the Word of God.
[time=2374] People were sitting out there and you saw all the little demons doing everything they could to disrupt the ministry of the Word.
[time=2380] Remember one, demons over in the corner pinching the toe of a baby so that it would scream during the service.
[time=2384] Now, I don't know if demons do that or not, but I know babies cry for other reasons.
[time=2390] We need to be careful that every little problem that comes to us we don't mean to think, "Oh, there's demons that work. Satan's at work there. That's not always the case. We need to be careful."
[time=2398] But somewhere in the middle we find a balance even in this passage, and I believe Peter's reminding us of three needs that we have, three things that we need in our life in these two verses.
[time=2408] We need to be ready, the need to be informed, and the need to be strong. Let's look at those three things. First of all, the need to be ready.
[time=2416] We need to anticipate the enemy. He says, "Be self-controlled and alert." That word "self-controlled" is the Greek word "napho."
[time=2428] And it literally means it's a negative word that means to be not intoxicated.
[time=2432] And that's why in the King James Version it says, "to be sober." But what Peter is not referring to, he's not saying that you should not be drunk.
[time=2440] He's using that word to say that you need to have no fuzziness of thinking or action about you. You need to be clear.
[time=2448] You need to be sharp. Be self-controlled and alert.
[time=2452] Remember being in ninth grade, stayed up late one Friday evening to watch the late show.
[time=2458] It happened to be one of these shows about the living dead coming up out of the graves and looking for people that they could eat.
[time=2466] One of those pleasant things you watch every now and then.
[time=2470] I was in the basement, and when the show is over, I got it to go upstairs.
[time=2474] My parents were already in bed. We lived next to a cemetery.
[time=2480] And I was old enough not to be too fearful, but I had this little uneasiness about me wondering what was actually going on next door.
[time=2488] But I made my way upstairs and into the room, closed my door, climbed into bed.
[time=2492] And after a short while, I began drifting off.
[time=2496] You know that in between stage, between wakefulness and sleeplessness?
[time=2500] That fuzziness that you have when you're half aware, that's where I was in.
[time=2506] That's the state I was in. Something bumped my door.
[time=2510] To this day, I know something bumped my door.
[time=2514] I don't know if it was wood expanding if it was a draught or what, but something bumped my door.
[time=2518] And I'll tell you, in that split second, I went from fuzziness of thinking that halfway in between state to being fully alert.
[time=2526] I mean, I was wide open eyes.
[time=2528] I was wide open ears listening to anything I could hear because I wasn't going to let anything come in and get me.
[time=2534] I was ready. I was alert.
[time=2536] And that's what Peter's saying here.
[time=2538] Don't be fuzzy in your thinking and your action. You need to be alert.
[time=2542] You need to be self-controlled. You need to be ready.
[time=2546] Heard on the radio this past week that they're having problems in the zoo and bag bad.
[time=2550] You can imagine that they probably would.
[time=2556] But the officials at the zoo were having problems with getting the supplies for their animals
[time=2562] and taking care of the needs of their animals.
[time=2564] And so one of the things that they had talked about doing said if we can't get things fixed up here, we're just going to have to let the animals go.
[time=2570] Open the cages and let them roam.
[time=2572] Now, if I was living in Baghdad, I'd be thankful for the next phrase that came out because he said, "Well, be assured we will not let the beasts loose." I was in Baghdad. I wouldn't want to see lions and tigers and bears roaming my streets.
[time=2584] But you can imagine if that were true.
[time=2586] If we had a lion loose around Fort Wayne or in your community,
[time=2592] would it affect the way that you acted, the way that you went about your daily living?
[time=2598] Would it affect the way that you walked from your front door to your car?
[time=2600] Would it affect some of the choices you made and the things that you did?
[time=2604] Yes, it would. We would be alert.
[time=2606] And that's what Peter's saying.
[time=2608] Satan is on the prowl, and we need to be ready.
[time=2614] It's not enough to wait till you face the conflict, till you face the enemy, and then say, "Oh, I should do something about this." We need to be prepared. We need to be watchful.
[time=2622] We need to be self-controlled. We need to be alert.
[time=2624] Be ready.
[time=2626] The second thing he says is be informed. Know the enemy.
[time=2630] Tells us something about Satan.
[time=2632] Now, we need to be careful that we don't get too interested on one hand,
[time=2638] but that we don't become too ignorant on the other.
[time=2642] Paul said in 2 Corinthians 2, he said, "We are not unaware of Satan's schemes." So we need to know something about our enemy, his strategies, who he is, what he's like.
[time=2652] We can learn much about him from the different titles he's given through scripture.
[time=2654] He's called the serpent. He's called Satan the accuser.
[time=2658] He's called the father of lies, the angel of light.
[time=2660] The prince of this world, the god of this age.
[time=2664] And here are two words used to describe this enemy in this passage.
[time=2668] It says, "Your enemy, the devil." This word enemy is the Greek word antiticus, which is two words together.
[time=2680] Anti means standing against.
[time=2682] The last part of that word comes from that Greek family of words that has to do with justice and law.
[time=2688] And you put the words together and antiticus refers to the person who stands against you in a lawsuit.
[time=2696] Person opposed to you in a lawsuit.
[time=2700] That's what Satan is. He's our enemy. He's our opposition.
[time=2706] But he doesn't play fair because it talks about him being the devil too.
[time=2708] And the word devil literally means slander or false accuser.
[time=2712] So here we have the Satan, this kind of a prosecuting attorney who not only accuses us but he will use any method he can to accuse us.
[time=2722] He will lie about us if that will help his cause.
[time=2726] We know from reading Revelation chapter 12 that that is one of the roles of Satan.
[time=2734] Revelation 12 talks about the accuser who stands before the throne of God and accuses Christians day and night.
[time=2740] You look back at the book of Job and you see Satan is the one coming before God and accusing Job of being really insincere in his obedience to God.
[time=2750] Satan says Job is only following you because of everything you've done for him, everything you've given him.
[time=2754] Satan is the accuser.
[time=2756] And I believe Satan not only accuses us before God, but he accuses us to our face.
[time=2762] The strategy that Satan will use whenever we face temptation is to give us 50 reasons why it won't be that bad.
[time=2770] It won't be that bad to go ahead and do it anyway even though we know what's wrong.
[time=2774] It won't be that bad.
[time=2774] But once we give in he turns around and says you rotten person.
[time=2780] How can you call yourself a Christian and live like this?
[time=2784] Do you really think God could love someone like you?
[time=2788] He accuses us.
[time=2790] And Peter says your enemy, your prosecuting attorney, that slander or the devil is on the prowl.
[time=2798] He's like a lion seeking whom he made devour.
[time=2802] Now I don't know what was in Peter's thinking when he wrote about this lion.
[time=2806] But I can't help but believe that when these Christians read this letter and they saw this imagery of a roaring lion that they didn't think of the persecutions that at this time Christians were facing.
[time=2820] This letter was written during the reign of Nero and if you know anything about history and the kind of person Nero was, it was under his rule that the persecution against the persecution against the Christians really began to rise.
[time=2836] Nero did strange things.
[time=2838] He turned to hate Christians.
[time=2840] He would take Christians.
[time=2840] He clothed them in fresh animal skins and turned them loose in a pack of wild dogs to watch as they'd be torn to bits.
[time=2850] History tells us that Nero would take live Christians and would bind them with cloth and then put pitch over them, tie them up on a pole, stick it in his garden, light them on fire and as they burn to death would have little parties in his garden.
[time=2866] He would call them his torches.
[time=2870] It was during his reign that in the Colosseum this huge arena that seated almost 100,000 people that would come and watch the gladiators and the violence that the cry began to be heard over and over again to the lions with the Christians, to the lions with the Christians.
[time=2886] And the lions kept under the walls of the Colosseum, made to be angry through, trying them, food kept from them so they'd be hungry.
[time=2896] Christians would be brought out into the middle of the arena as people cheered and watched.
[time=2900] The gates opened as the lions were let loose and they would roam through that arena.
[time=2906] They would kill and eat Christians because of their faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2910] Can't help but believe is that word spread and these Christians read this letter that they had that image of mine of Satan being the one who is out to destroy us.
[time=2918] He wants to destroy us in every way.
[time=2922] Satan, if allowed, will affect us physically.
[time=2924] We know he has that ability when God allows to affect, to bring disease, even death.
[time=2930] He wants to affect us mentally.
[time=2932] He wants to cause us to believe the lie instead of truth, wants to deceive us.
[time=2936] He wants to affect us, he wants to devour us, he wants to eat us up even spiritually, wants to make us ineffective in our service for God.
[time=2944] And I think, if I was Peter writing this letter, when I came to this part and as I penned the words seeking to devour you, I think my mind would go back to a room.
[time=2960] The last celebration of the Passover I would have with this Jesus that I had followed for the last few years.
[time=2968] And as he shares it with us, he tells us that one of us is going to betray him.
[time=2974] And we as his disciples can't believe that be true and we begin discussing among ourselves, who would it be?
[time=2978] It's not me.
[time=2980] Maybe it's Thomas.
[time=2982] Could it be Judas?
[time=2984] And as I began discussing who it would be that betrayed Jesus, the conversation turned to who is the greatest among us.
[time=2990] And I can see as each defended themselves certainly won't be me that betrayed Jesus.
[time=2994] They began defending themselves by saying, telling how good they were.
[time=2998] And the argument turned to who was the greatest among them.
[time=3000] And of course, Peter, I'm not sure what he said.
[time=3002] But knowing Peter, I wouldn't be surprised that he reminded the other disciples.
[time=3006] Remember, Jesus said to me that you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church.
[time=3012] In the middle of all this, Jesus stops and reminds them of what true greatness is.
[time=3018] And then turns to Peter and says, tells Peter this Peter, Satan has asked to sift you like wheat.
[time=3026] Satan has asked to sift you like wheat, but I'm praying for you that your faith will remain.
[time=3034] Satan wants to tear us apart.
[time=3036] He wants to devour us.
[time=3038] We face a formidable enemy.
[time=3044] He's bent on our destruction.
[time=3050] And we need to have the proper kind of respect, and yet we don't need to have despair.
[time=3054] When we face this enemy, we don't need to be like the people of Israel as they face the tons of this giant goliath who were so fearful they stayed back.
[time=3062] And yet this boy David, this young man David steps out not because of his strong ability, but because of his trust in God and defeated the giant.
[time=3076] This roaring lion seeking to devour us, we need to have the proper respect, but we don't need to fear.
[time=3082] Peter goes on to say that we need to be strong.
[time=3086] We need to fight the enemy in verse 9.
[time=3090] Resist him standing firm in the faith.
[time=3096] Now it may on the surface appear that he's giving us two commands, two instructions there.
[time=3100] That we need to resist him, and that also that we need to stand firm in the faith.
[time=3106] But when you look at the way it's really written, it's not intended to communicate that to us.
[time=3110] In fact, in the NIV, that word standing that's there really isn't in the original language.
[time=3116] It's implied, but it's not there.
[time=3118] The word firm means to be solid, to be strong.
[time=3122] It even has the connotation of being obstinate.
[time=3126] There's a time in our life when it's proper to be obstinate.
[time=3128] When Satan taunts us with his ridicules, his lies and deceptions, we can be obstinate as we are firm, solid, strong in the faith.
[time=3136] In the truth of who God is and what he has done.
[time=3140] And what it's saying here is that as you are firm in the faith, being standing firm in the faith, then you can resist.
[time=3148] You ever seen the game played King of the Mountain, maybe played it yourself?
[time=3154] All it's required is a little hill or mountain somewhere and a few people that don't mind being killed or severely mangled.
[time=3160] Because the object of the game is for one person to stand on this mound and everybody else to do whatever they can to try to knock them off.
[time=3166] But as long as you can stay on top, you're King of the Mountain.
[time=3170] The way to be successful in that game is to stand on top and to make sure you have a solid stance.
[time=3176] So as they come up, you can be knocking people back.
[time=3178] But as long as you can stand firm, you're going to win.
[time=3180] And here, what Peter says is as you stand firm in your faith, then you can resist.
[time=3184] You see, if you don't stand firm, you can't resist.
[time=3186] You've got to be standing when the enemy comes.
[time=3192] And if you're not, don't be surprised when you fall.
[time=3196] People say, "I can't understand why I keep being defeated." You can't just expect temptation, whatever, to come your way and you're going to be successful.
[time=3204] If you're not already standing firm in the Word of God, that's what brings success in the hour of the battle.
[time=3212] So when we know the Word, when God's truth is in us and when we are living it out, then we are standing firm, standing firm on the truth.
[time=3218] Reminding of Ephesians chapter 6, it talks about standing as well.
[time=3226] It says that we need to put on the whole armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[time=3232] And then it goes on, it says therefore in verse 13 of chapter 6, put on the full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your guard.
[time=3242] And it doesn't stop there.
[time=3244] It says when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your guard and after you have done everything to stand.
[time=3250] The picture there is someone who is planted firmly, who stands, when the resistance comes, they're able to stand.
[time=3256] And when they have done everything else, when they're in the middle of the battle, when everything has been thrown against them, they are still left standing.
[time=3262] When we have that kind of stance, that kind of firmness on the truth of God, then we can resist.
[time=3268] And this word resist here is literally means to withstand.
[time=3274] It's a defensive term.
[time=3274] It doesn't mean that we go out and find the devil and try to do battle with him.
[time=3278] It means that when the Satan comes to us, when the devil comes to us, we are ready to resist.
[time=3284] See, we don't have to go out devil hunting.
[time=3288] We don't have to go out looking for demons.
[time=3290] That's not our job.
[time=3290] Our job is to do the work God calls us to do, to live the life of Christ, and I'll tell you something, when you do that, Satan will find you.
[time=3298] Now most of us probably don't do that much battle spiritually against the devil or demons.
[time=3306] And that may be true partly is because we're not really involved in the warfare.
[time=3310] We're not much of a threat.
[time=3314] But when Jesus was on the scene, when those who followed him went out and proclaiming the truth, that's when the opposition came.
[time=3320] You won't face opposition when you're sitting back not doing anything, but when you are firmly planted in the faith, in the truth, and you are following the Lord Jesus Christ, you'll face opposition.
[time=3332] And here we're told to resist, to withstand.
[time=3338] I like what Martin Luther once wrote.
[time=3344] It's a hymn, it's a verse in the hymn, "A mighty fortress is our God, and it goes, "And though this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us, we will not fear for God has willed his truth to triumph through us."
[time=3356] The prince of darkness, grim, we tremble not for him.
[time=3360] His rage we can endure for low his doom is sure.
[time=3364] Listen to this one little word shall fell him.
[time=3370] Satan can be defeated with one word.
[time=3374] You take the truth of God, lived and spoken through the power of his spirit, and Satan is defeated.
[time=3382] This isn't a magic book.
[time=3384] You don't defeat demons by opening to some passage and start reading it.
[time=3388] It's the truth, lived in power that can defeat Satan.
[time=3390] We need to resist.
[time=3394] To Martin Luther, this resisting was so real, Satan was so real in his attacks against him that he said and did some strange things, but he yelled at Satan, he talked to Satan.
[time=3404] The story told at one point he was at his desk, and he picked up his ink well and hurled it against the wall at the del, so the devil would get away.
[time=3410] Do we resist? I remember writing in the car along the expressway one day, a number of years ago, and I was going through a battle.
[time=3420] Now, I don't have spiritual eyes.
[time=3422] I don't see if there were demons around.
[time=3424] I don't know what part they played, but I was going through a battle of whiteness and wrongness in my life, and it was real, and it was a struggle.
[time=3430] And I remember pulling the car off the road, getting out of my car and yelling over the hood of my car, Satan, I don't belong to you.
[time=3440] I'm bought by the blood of Jesus.
[time=3442] Now, I don't know what people thought, as they drove by and saw me yelling over the hood of my car at something, but I got back in my car and drove on.
[time=3448] We need to resist Satan with the truth that we live and speak, and we can resist without fear.
[time=3454] You know, Satan is, as we said, a formidable enemy, but he's an enemy that's chained.
[time=3462] He's an enemy that's bound.
[time=3464] He's an enemy that doesn't have free reign.
[time=3466] He can only do what God allows, and yes, the chain is long.
[time=3468] Yes, it's loose.
[time=3470] Yes, he is allowed to do a number of things, even in hindrance against us.
[time=3474] But, you know, Satan had to ask to go to Job and try him.
[time=3478] He had to ask to sift Peter like wheat.
[time=3480] We can have confidence in that.
[time=3482] Walking down the street one day.
[time=3484] And unexpectedly, also, I heard, off to my left barking, the dog came running towards me.
[time=3492] Now, there are different kinds of dogs.
[time=3494] There's doggies, cute little things.
[time=3498] There's dogs, and then there's dogs.
[time=3502] You know, this was a dog.
[time=3504] And when that dog started barking and running towards me, my first inclination was, I froze, but I wanted to run.
[time=3510] I wanted to jump.
[time=3512] I wanted to do anything I could to get out of there.
[time=3514] My heart started pounding, and then I looked and I noticed that around that dog's neck was a leash.
[time=3522] Connected to that leash was a chain.
[time=3524] And connected to that chain was a tree.
[time=3528] And when I noticed that that was the truth, and I noticed the dog, when he reached into that, just stopped.
[time=3534] You know, my attitude changed.
[time=3536] I mean, my heart didn't immediately stop pounding as fast, but I began to calm down, and I walked on calmly as if I had no care in the world.
[time=3542] Do you know why? Because I saw the truth that dog couldn't get me.
[time=3546] Yeah, it was something to be respected, but he couldn't get me.
[time=3548] And, you know, we need to realize that Satan's the same way.
[time=3552] Someone to be respected in who he is, not to be ridiculed, I don't believe.
[time=3556] He's a formidable enemy, and yet, even in this God, God is in control.
[time=3564] Well, Peter goes on to remind us for a reason that we have to fight.
[time=3574] We could think of a lot of reasons to be involved in the battle.
[time=3576] Perhaps for the glory of God, we need to be involved in fight against the devil.
[time=3580] For our own discipline, we should be involved in the warfare against the devil.
[time=3584] For the hindrance of Satan and his armies, we need to be involved in the warfare.
[time=3588] But here, Peter, remind us that another reason, an important reason, is that we're part of an army.
[time=3594] There are others who are fighting in the war.
[time=3596] He says that in the last part of 9 says, "Because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering, and for their sake, we need to be people who do not give up,
[time=3608] but are involved in the spiritual battle." It's been our privilege today to share with you music from our sanctuary choir,
