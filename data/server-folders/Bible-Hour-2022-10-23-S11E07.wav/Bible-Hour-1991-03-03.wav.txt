[time=60] - Doctors tell us that stress has become the number one medical problem in America today.
[time=78] Stay with us because we're gonna be looking at some vital principles from God's Word that help us deal with anxiety.
[time=90] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study, Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=101] Thank you for joining us.
[time=103] Our special guest speaker today is Russell Moore, the Vice President for Student Affairs at the Masters College in Santa Clarita, California.
[time=111] His message today is entitled, "Anxious for Nothing." His text is taken from the Book of Philippians, chapter 4, verses 4 through 6.
[time=120] Our special music today includes a duet from Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe, and a solo from Read the Favor.
[time=129] Let's join our service as the sanctuary choir and orchestra bring us a song entitled, "God of My Praise."
[time=150] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=358] (audience applauds) - May Jesus Christ continue to be praised
[time=368] as we sing that song, "Him Number 87," please.
[time=372] "Him Number 87," you're singing well today.
[time=374] Thank you for joining with us.
[time=376] We'll sing verses one, three, and six.
[time=379] (orchestral music)
[time=409] [MUSIC - 67 seconds]
[time=480] - We sing with our voices praise to the Lord.
[time=485] Let's listen now with our hearts as we listen to the ministry of Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rose.
[time=490] They come to sing a very beautiful song.
[time=492] Listen to the words and join into the message of it.
[time=495] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=746] - Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=748] We're glad that you've tuned in.
[time=750] We're sorry that you were not able to see the Bible Hour last week because of the Easter Seal telethon, but we're grateful that we're on every Sunday morning throughout the year and that you tune in and worship with us through the medium of television.
[time=764] I'd like to tell you about an event that's coming up in a few weeks.
[time=767] We'll be in the Easter season before long and we have traditionally now had an Easter program that is a good Friday service downtown in Fort Wayne at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=779] That program is on Friday, March 29th, from 1215 to 1245.
[time=785] We have a number of our people that work in the downtown area and we've invited them to invite their friends to come and fellowship with us for just a half hour of drama, some music, and then a message from God's Word.
[time=798] I hope you'll set that data side.
[time=800] Once again, it's Friday, March 29th from 1215 to 1245 at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=808] We've had a wonderful time this week, fellow shipping with special guests that we have at the church.
[time=815] Russ and Heidi Moore have been with us for the last three or four days and Russ is going to be speaking this morning.
[time=820] Good morning Russ.
[time=821] - Hi Pete.
[time=822] - It's nice to have you here at Black Hawk and we had the privilege of being with you just a couple weeks ago in California.
[time=828] Russ is responsible for many activities at Masters College.
[time=833] He's the Vice President in charge of Student Affairs and Russ, tell us a little bit about the college.
[time=839] - Well, the Masters College is an exciting place, Pete.
[time=842] We've got about 850 students who come from all over the country in different parts of the world to study God's Word and to prepare for God's service.
[time=851] It's a fully accredited Christian liberal arts college and so they train in various areas of discipline by way of business, school of business or pre-med or whatever major they're interested in and we give them a strong Bible major to go with that that they can be fully equipped to serve God in the marketplace.
[time=869] - Russ, we're well aware of the school and we believe in it and we are thankful for the students that have gone there already and are out in the marketplace doing just what you've said.
[time=879] Just a couple weeks ago, Russ, we had the President of Masters College, Dr. John MacArthur with us and you've certainly had some association with Dr. MacArthur.
[time=888] - That's true.
[time=889] By God's grace, I was saved under John's ministry about 12 years ago and about a year after that, I was able to come on staff in the Children's Division teaching young people the Word of God and then stayed there for about six years until John became the President of the Masters College and he asked me to switch over my responsibilities to my current role at the college.
[time=912] It's been a wonderful relationship and we have a lot of fun serving God together.
[time=916] - Well, I also know that you like to preach and that's been an encouragement to you and you've been encouraged by men like John MacArthur and you have been preaching for a number of years now at Foothill Baptist Church.
[time=928] Is that right near the college, is it?
[time=930] - Yeah, Foothill Baptist Church is in a little city called Silmar and it's maybe 10 or 15 minutes away from the college and I have the privilege of pastoring there, I guess part time, they allow me to come on Sundays and preach the Word of God and minister to them and it's gotta be one of the greatest joys of my life just to open the scriptures and teach from God's Word.
[time=950] - Well, speaking of teaching and preaching, you'll be speaking this morning and this evening, tell us a little bit about your message for this morning.
[time=956] - Well, we're gonna be talking about anxiety, a brooding fear over a future contingency and I think all of us at one point or another in our lives are dealing with some level of anxiety and God's Word has some helpful principles for us and we'll be looking at those.
[time=971] - Oh Russell, we're glad that you and Heidi have been able to spend the weekend here in Fort Wayne and particularly at Blackhawk Baptist Church and we look forward to your message in just a few minutes.
[time=980] We talked about Dr. John MacArthur and he was here just a few weeks ago and we videotaped his service with us.
[time=987] We called it an evening with Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=990] Dr. MacArthur is very strong in the Word and that was true of that evening when he spoke to us and challenged us to be in the Word.
[time=997] To use the Word as our guide for Christian living.
[time=1000] We'd like to make that message available and you can receive it today if you'll write to us here at the Bible Hour.
[time=1006] Just ask for the videotape and evening with Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=1010] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1020] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1028] If you can enclose a gift of $15 to help to fray the cost of providing the tape, we'd appreciate that very much.
[time=1036] Oh, we're glad that you've tuned in with us.
[time=1038] I hope that you've already received a blessing from the music of the Bible Hour.
[time=1041] We go back to some music and then the message from the Word of God from our special guest, Pastor Russell Moore.
[time=1048] Stay with us, won't you?

[time=1292] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=1459] It's bound prayer.
[time=1462] Our Father, when we look over this audience, and we've already talked with people that have real hurts today, they're really struggling through some difficulties in their lives.
[time=1476] I'm so thankful that when you wrap your arms around us how helpful you can be, not necessarily just take away the struggle immediately but to help us through the difficult times.
[time=1488] It seems as when we capture one, something else comes in our way.
[time=1492] Let me just pray for our congregation right now specifically.
[time=1495] Write these people that are gathered here together.
[time=1498] Some that have real hurts.
[time=1500] Let me pray that you'll help them as they've experienced the loss of loved ones this week.
[time=1505] Some separated from their spouses.
[time=1510] Some having difficulty in their jobs.
[time=1513] Some having to deal with integrity in their jobs and wondering what to do, knowing what God would have them do, but knowing the price that it might pay might cost them.
[time=1524] Father, we're just thankful that we can come in here and be renewed and rejoice in you because we worship the Savior and we know what He's done for us and that the time is coming when we're going to live with you without the pain and the sorrow that we experience here.
[time=1539] They'll be joy in the morning, Lord, and we look forward to that day.
[time=1542] But help us as we live here, that we'll live with joyful spirits or rejoicing in you because we have the Savior.
[time=1549] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[time=1552] What a wonderful fact to know that regardless of the circumstances you've gone through this week that in Heaven's eyes are on any losers among all of you today because of the Savior.
[time=1566] We've had a wonderful week here since Wednesday.
[time=1568] We've had special guests in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Russell, and Heidi Moore have been with us from California.
[time=1574] They have spent some time with the Search Committee and with the Elder Board and some of the members of the Church and have traveled around Fort Wayne just to see what Fort Wayne is like.
[time=1583] We're delighted that they're here today to worship with us and also to minister to us through the spoken word.
[time=1588] We'll also be speaking in a few moments and he'll also be speaking this evening.
[time=1592] As Russ comes, he is the Vice President for Academic Affairs.
[time=1597] I'm going to correct that.
[time=1599] He is Vice President for Student Affairs at Masters College.
[time=1602] He's also the pastor of Foothill Baptist Church in Sylmar, California.
[time=1606] He's a very, very active schedule, very busy man, and we're delighted that he's had the opportunity to take some time out and come.
[time=1613] He's going to come to the pulpit.
[time=1614] I hope you'll welcome him as well as his wife, Heidi, who'll be standing right here in the front.
[time=1618] Let's welcome Russell and Heidi Moore to our Church.
[time=1620] Thank you very much, Pete.
[time=1630] Heidi and I want you to know that this has turned out to be an unforgettable time in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1637] I think the highlight had to be the basketball game on Friday night.
[time=1640] It was a dream come true.
[time=1642] We actually got to go to an Indiana high school basketball game.
[time=1645] We'd seen the movie, "The Hoosiers" out there.
[time=1647] I didn't believe that was true.
[time=1648] Then we went and found out it was.
[time=1650] You guys are crazy.
[time=1652] Lots of fun.
[time=1653] We just had a great, great time.
[time=1656] Will you take your Bibles with me this morning and open to the book of Philippians?
[time=1660] To what I think is probably a familiar passage to most of us.
[time=1664] Many of us have probably committed it to memory.
[time=1667] It's a favorite.
[time=1669] But I'll confess I need a good message on this this morning.
[time=1673] Philippians 4, verse 6.
[time=1678] Be anxious for nothing.
[time=1681] But in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanks, giving, let your requests be made known to God.
[time=1690] As you know, Heidi and I are considering a significant transition in our lives.
[time=1694] We spent the last 12 years ministering at Grace Community Church and the Masters College and the last several at Foothill Baptist.
[time=1701] We've had a great time.
[time=1702] We grew up in sunny Southern California.
[time=1705] Both of us did.
[time=1706] And all of our family is within just a few minutes drive.
[time=1709] Maybe two hours at the most.
[time=1711] We really like where we are.
[time=1713] But the Lord is working in our hearts and it's becoming clear that what God would have me to do is to find a gracious group of people who would allow me to serve as their pastor/teacher where I can focus the principal part of my life in the study and the preaching of God's Word.
[time=1729] And as a result, the transition is about.
[time=1731] And we believe it's of God.
[time=1732] We believe it's the right time.
[time=1735] And we're just waiting for God to clearly reveal to us where that would be.
[time=1740] But I must confess in the midst of all that, I've had some sleepless nights.
[time=1744] It's tough to fall asleep and to get your mind to stop cranking through all the possible details
[time=1751] that will impact our little family.
[time=1753] I've locked my keys in the car twice in the last seven days.
[time=1758] I've never done that before in my life.
[time=1761] I have trouble concentrating, I missed several important appointments last week at the college that I'm not known for missing appointments.
[time=1767] I blew right over those things.
[time=1769] My secretary couldn't find me.
[time=1771] I was gone.
[time=1772] And then finally she found me.
[time=1773] She said, "Where were you?" And I said, "Oh, that's right.
[time=1775] We do have that meeting every week, don't we?" Unbelievable.
[time=1779] In fact, as I was studying through this message, for this message, on anxiety, I ran across an article, coping with anxiety, I think it was called.
[time=1787] And in the article there was a test you could take, an anxiety inventory.
[time=1791] And so I tried to take it with honesty and integrity.
[time=1794] And I scored rather high.
[time=1796] I'm ready for a good message on anxiety this morning.
[time=1801] As you look at the passage in front of you, it's really a series of verses.
[time=1805] Verses four through nine.
[time=1807] And at the center of those verses is verse six.
[time=1811] That idea of not being anxious for anything.
[time=1814] Now, if you were reading in the Greek, something would jump off the page at you almost as if
[time=1820] neon lights were flashing at you.
[time=1822] And it would be the verbs in this passage.
[time=1824] They're all written in the imperative mood, imperitival verbs.
[time=1828] And they all kind of look the same in the Greek.
[time=1831] They are as follows.
[time=1832] Let me give them to you.
[time=1833] Rejoice.
[time=1834] That's the imperative.
[time=1835] Rejoice in verse four.
[time=1837] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1839] The second imperitival verb down in verse five, let be known.
[time=1844] Let your forebearing spirit be known to all men.
[time=1849] The third, verse six, be anxious for nothing.
[time=1853] Imperitival verb is a command, by the way.
[time=1856] Also another one in verse six, be made known.
[time=1860] Let your requests imperitival verb be made known to God.
[time=1865] Number five, in verse eight at the very end, let your mind dwell on these things.
[time=1871] And then verse nine, practice these things.
[time=1876] I don't know how many of these we'll get to this morning.
[time=1879] Let's see how it goes by beginning with verse four.
[time=1882] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1886] Now, I've heard this taught on many times as you probably have.
[time=1890] And we've heard some good teaching on it.
[time=1892] The basic thrust is that we as believers can know an un-circumstantial joy.
[time=1897] Because of our relationship with Jesus Christ, we can know as a pattern, pattern and practice
[time=1903] of life an un-circumstantial joy, a joy which is unaffected by circumstances.
[time=1908] I think that's partly true.
[time=1911] But I think as you and I realize, it seems to break down when we run into a severe event
[time=1917] or a tragic event in our lives.
[time=1918] And I mean tragic, maybe the loss of a job.
[time=1921] Maybe the death of a child.
[time=1923] Maybe the diagnosing of cancer.
[time=1926] Lethal cancer.
[time=1928] And we begin at that point after we, I guess, come out of the shock of it all.
[time=1933] There are some real serious emotions going on inside of us, the least of which we would call joy.
[time=1938] Too often it's anger and confusion.
[time=1941] And primarily those emotions are directed at our God.
[time=1946] What in the world are you doing to my life?
[time=1950] Those are real emotions.
[time=1953] And I think what tends to happen in our hearts is we begin to remember Philippians 4 and 4 and we begin to say to ourselves, I'm not supposed to feel that emotion, those emotions.
[time=1961] I'm supposed to rejoice in the Lord always, un-circumstantial.
[time=1966] It's almost as if it's one mountaintop experience after another.
[time=1971] And so we begin to try to make that verse come true in our lives.
[time=1975] And it's at that point that we are suspected doing something very damaging and very dangerous to our relationship with Christ, and it's this.
[time=1983] To try to make this verse come true, we begin to deny how we're really feeling about that unpleasant event.
[time=1990] Begin to pretend, you know, maybe I don't really feel that bad about it.
[time=1994] Try to push those feelings aside and get on this rejoice thing.
[time=1999] And it's damaging to your Christianity.
[time=2003] It's damaging to your relationship with Jesus Christ and it's damaging to your relationships with fellow brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[time=2011] Would you turn with me to the Old Testament and let's look at an example, the life of Habakkuk?
[time=2016] You're thinking where in the world is that book?
[time=2019] Habakkuk, it's in the crispy portion of the Old Testament, the part you rarely get to.
[time=2028] It goes Jonah, Micah, Nehem, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Hagai, Zechariah, and then the Italian prophet Malachi.
[time=2038] Jonah, Micah, Nehem, Habakkuk.
[time=2041] And look with me at chapter three and we will find a man who is saying in his own terminology
[time=2047] the exact same truth we're looking at in Philippians 4.
[time=2050] He is rejoicing in the Lord.
[time=2052] Look at verse 18, chapter 3.
[time=2055] Yet, I will exalt in the Lord.
[time=2058] Now, exalt means to greatly rejoice.
[time=2060] It's a stronger word than the one we looked at in Philippians 4.
[time=2064] I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
[time=2068] The Lord, God is my strength.
[time=2070] He has made my feet like Heinz's feet and makes me walk on high places.
[time=2074] That's a wonderful place to be in your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2078] But I'd like you to go to chapter one and let's see how this man got there.
[time=2083] He's a prophet.
[time=2084] He's an Old Testament prophet and he's looking around his native Judah and he's seeing sin and he's seeing injustice and he's seeing the law of God being treated with utter disregard.
[time=2094] And where is his great God to bring vengeance and to discipline his people?
[time=2099] So he cries out in verse two, "How long, O Lord, will I call for help?
[time=2104] And thou wilt not hear?
[time=2106] I cry out to the violence, yet thou does not save.
[time=2110] Why, dost thou make me see iniquity and cause me to look on wickedness?
[time=2114] Yes, destruction and violence are before me.
[time=2117] Strife exists and contention arises.
[time=2120] Therefore, the law is ignored and justice is never upheld.
[time=2124] The wicked surround the righteous.
[time=2127] Therefore, justice comes out perverted.
[time=2129] He's describing the condition in Judah.
[time=2132] And there are men in Judah who are wicked, namely the king Jehoiakim.
[time=2135] And they are not obeying the law of God.
[time=2138] And this great prophet of God doesn't understand his circumstances.
[time=2141] And he doesn't understand his God.
[time=2143] Why aren't you fixing this problem?
[time=2146] He's feeling the reality of his life and he's bringing it before God.
[time=2149] Now look at God's answer in verse six.
[time=2151] Very confusing to Habakkuk.
[time=2153] For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans.
[time=2156] Jump down to verse 11.
[time=2158] They will sweep through like the wind and pass on.
[time=2162] The Chaldeans is another word for the Babylonians and the great king Nebuchadnezzar in the destruction of Jerusalem in 605 B.C. when all those folks were deported to Babylon.
[time=2172] God says I'm going to respond to the wickedness of Judah.
[time=2175] You know how I'm going to do it?
[time=2176] I'm going to bring the Babylonians down here and wipe you guys out.
[time=2179] But that only aggravated Habakkuk situation.
[time=2182] It didn't solve his problem.
[time=2184] And he comes up with another question.
[time=2186] See it in verse 13.
[time=2188] The second part.
[time=2190] Why does thou look with favor on those who deal treacherously?
[time=2194] Why are thou silent when the wicked swallow up those more righteous than they?
[time=2200] God we're unrighteous down here in Judah and we're not obeying the law but we're not as bad as the Chaldeans.
[time=2206] What in the world how can you justify bringing in that he the nation to wipe us out?
[time=2212] And you see Habakkuk is feeling this in a serious way.
[time=2216] This is all of his life.
[time=2218] This is his culture.
[time=2219] This is his country that's going to be destroyed.
[time=2221] But I think even more significantly than that it's his job.
[time=2224] It's his professional vocation to call the people of Judah to repentance so that the invasion doesn't have to occur.
[time=2230] He's turning into a failure.
[time=2232] These are walking papers.
[time=2233] These are Habakkuk.
[time=2234] Your time is up.
[time=2235] They haven't repented.
[time=2236] And here come the Chaldeans.
[time=2237] It's like getting fired from your job.
[time=2240] And it hurts.
[time=2242] And it's exposing.
[time=2243] And it's humiliating.
[time=2244] And it makes you vulnerable.
[time=2246] There's a future contingency in this man's life.
[time=2249] That he doesn't want any part of.
[time=2251] It's the last thing in the world he wants to see, but it's coming.
[time=2255] Listen to God's answer again.
[time=2257] Look at chapter 2 verse 4.
[time=2260] He says, "Behold, as for the proud one his soul is not right within him."
[time=2266] Habakkuk, you're proud.
[time=2268] Your soul is not right within you.
[time=2270] And then this classic line.
[time=2272] "But the righteous will live by faith."
[time=2278] I'm finished answering your questions.
[time=2280] I'm finished having you accuse me of being foolish, Habakkuk.
[time=2285] I know what Judah is doing and I know what I'm planning to do.
[time=2288] And I know that amidst all of your understanding of that, it drives real pain and agony into your heart as you will see the demise of your country and yourself as a professional failure.
[time=2298] But my friend, allow those unfavorable circumstances to drive you to me and worship me in faith.
[time=2306] Trust me.
[time=2309] You see, I don't think that what God wants from us as believers in our New Testament life,
[time=2315] when the circumstances go sour and they do go sour.
[time=2319] And there are future contingencies out there that boggle our minds and mean the same for us as for Habakkuk, humiliation and exposure of weakness, and there are some vulnerable moments in our lives.
[time=2331] The Christian solution is not to pretend it doesn't exist or to pretend it doesn't matter and that I don't really feel the impact of that.
[time=2338] I believe that Godly solution to that, the way of dealing with that and the way that glorifies God and moves us on a healthy path to tasting for brief moments, the reality of rejoicing in the Lord is by embracing all of the reality of the downside
[time=2353] of that future contingency and allowing that reality to drive you in dependence and faith
[time=2359] to your great God.
[time=2362] Look again chapter 3 verse 17, he is more than aware of his circumstances.
[time=2367] He says though the fig tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines, though the yield of the olive should fail and the fields produce no food, though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls.
[time=2379] You understand, he knows exactly what's coming.
[time=2382] This is an agrarian community, they're completely dependent upon the list of produce, just red, and it's all going to be gone.
[time=2389] Yet I will exalt in the Lord verse 18, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
[time=2394] Verse 19, the Lord God is my strength.
[time=2397] Give me the strength to face the reality of my life, not to deny it, to face it and to live with purpose and godliness in the midst of it and cause it to drive me to grab ahold of you, my great and awesome God with the hands of faith.
[time=2412] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=2417] Let's go back to Philippians 4.
[time=2421] Philippians chapter 4 and look at verse 5.
[time=2425] If you thought that one was hard to do and we both know it is, wait till you hear what he's asking of us in verse 5.
[time=2433] We're supposed to evidence of forbearing spirit, do you see it?
[time=2436] Let your forbearing spirit be known to all men, the Lord is near.
[time=2440] Now, forbearing spirit is no word we typically use in our day-to-day conversation.
[time=2445] It has to do with our rights as human beings, our rights as Christians, our rights as family members, our rights as citizens.
[time=2452] And a forbearing spirit is a spirit which is willing to give your rights up to advance the cause of Christ.
[time=2460] A forbearing spirit is willing to give up rights, rights that are justly yours to advance the cause of Christ.
[time=2469] Let me give you another illustration of that.
[time=2470] Would you go to Acts chapter 16?
[time=2473] This is the Apostle Paul, his first visit in the city of Philippi, the book that we're now studying.
[time=2481] He had been called there through a vision of God, the Macedonian vision, taking the gospel to Europe for the first time.
[time=2488] He arrives there in Philippi, he meets the lady Lydia, she's a seller of purple fabrics, he tells her about God, she accepts Jesus Christ as her Savior, she's baptized, the ministry is off to a great start.
[time=2500] But there's this demon-possessed slave woman that begins to follow Paul and Silas all around saying things about them and it eventually irritates them to the point that in verse 18 you'll see I command Paul, says I command you in the name of Jesus Christ
[time=2515] to come out of her and it came out of her at that very moment.
[time=2519] That angered her masters in verse 19 who saw their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.
[time=2528] Verse 22, "A crowd arose up together against them and the chief magistrates tore their robes off of them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods and when they had inflicted many blows upon them they threw them into prison commanding the jailer to guard them securely and he having such a command threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in stocks.
[time=2551] This is an unpleasant circumstance.
[time=2555] To be beaten with rods eventually flazed the flesh on your back.
[time=2559] To be thrown in stocks it was a device that would separate your legs and hold them in that position such that your joints couldn't move and the chemical that your body excretes causes great pain.
[time=2570] You've experienced it when you've driven too long in the same direction without getting out to rest.
[time=2574] The inner prison was a dark dungeon without sanitary provision.
[time=2578] I won't say any more but let your mind work on that a little bit.
[time=2581] They were in pain and they were in darkness and it stunk and they were an agony in one sense.
[time=2588] But look at verse 25.
[time=2591] But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God
[time=2597] and the prisoners were listening to them.
[time=2599] Isn't it interesting that what is described immediately prior to verse 25 where it says they're praying and praising God is this list of tragedy that had come into their life.
[time=2610] They were aware that they were in stocks.
[time=2612] They were aware that their circumstances were unfavorable but they were allowing those circumstances to drive them in faith to God accepting that reality and finding their joy in God.
[time=2623] But you say what does this have to do with a forbearing spirit?
[time=2626] Look at verse 12.
[time=2628] Notice that Philippi is a Roman colony.
[time=2634] A Roman colony.
[time=2637] Paul was a Roman citizen.
[time=2639] Did you know it was against Roman law to do what they did to him by pulling him out into the marketplace in a crowd rising up in a riot of sorts?
[time=2647] A Roman citizen in a Roman colony could never be treated that way.
[time=2651] He must have a proper trial.
[time=2654] Did you also know that by virtue of being a Roman citizen you could never be beaten with rods as he was?
[time=2660] It was against Roman law.
[time=2662] Never should a Roman have that happen to him.
[time=2666] All Paul had to do when those magistrates took a hold of him and drug him into the marketplace was say did you know that I'm a Roman citizen and it would have stopped immediately.
[time=2675] Just gone.
[time=2678] But he didn't.
[time=2679] He gave up his rights as a Roman citizen and I don't know what was going on between he and the Holy Spirit.
[time=2686] But because he gave up those rights and he went through all that turmoil he was thrown in that prison and you remember what happened.
[time=2693] He was an earthquake and the jailer knew that if the prisoners were free he'd die so he was going to kill himself and Paul said wait and gave him the gospel and the Philippian jailer and his entire household were baptized that night.
[time=2706] A forbearing spirit is a willingness to give up your rights to advance the cause of Christ.
[time=2714] And you say wait a minute.
[time=2715] Does that mean that as a Christian I have to roll over and play dead in my marketplace with my business and with my children with my school system in the daily throes of life?
[time=2725] Am I just to give up on my rights?
[time=2728] No.
[time=2731] Look at verse 37.
[time=2734] Paul said to them, actually verse 36, the jailer reported these words to Paul saying the chief magistrates have sent to release you.
[time=2742] Now therefore come out and go in peace.
[time=2744] In other words we want you out of this prison and we want you out of this city.
[time=2747] First you cast this demon out of this woman.
[time=2749] Now we've got earthquakes because of you.
[time=2751] Would you please leave?
[time=2752] Verse 37, but Paul said to them, they have beaten us in public without trial.
[time=2759] Men who are now, he reveals it, Romans and have thrown us into prison and now they are sending us away secretly?
[time=2767] No indeed.
[time=2768] Let them come themselves and bring us out.
[time=2771] And the policeman reported these words to the chief magistrates and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
[time=2779] These guys knew they were in trouble because they had broken Roman law.
[time=2785] And they came out and appealed to them, verse 39, and when they had brought them out they kept begging them to leave the city, but he didn't leave the city.
[time=2792] Look what he did.
[time=2793] They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia who just come to know Christ and deserve the right to be encouraged by this great apostle Paul and that he could explain to her the realities of Christian life what had happened to them was all within the sovereign plan of God.
[time=2807] And then he went on from there and he saw the other brethren, the other folks that had come to Christ, and then he departed them.
[time=2815] Rarely in our lives will we come up to a future contingency, a thing over which we feel much anxiety without having some people involved.
[time=2823] Maybe it's a boss, maybe it's a family member.
[time=2826] Usually there's a personality or two involved.
[time=2829] And what God is calling us to do is to examine those relationships in the midst of that anxious moment and say, "Am I demanding my rights here for my own benefit, for my own well-being?
[time=2843] Or would I be willing as best as I can understand with my finite mind to either stand for my rights or give my rights up?" And to make that decision based not upon my own pleasure and my own personal success, but upon the advancement of the kingdom of God.
[time=2863] For bearing spirit. Let's go back to Philippians 4.
[time=2867] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=2870] Let your forebearing spirit be known to all men the Lord is near and then be anxious for nothing.
[time=2878] And he gives us some help here in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. Let your requests be made known to God.
[time=2889] When I read this verse, I began to study it even years ago, I always wondered why there were so many different words for prayer in this verse.
[time=2898] Do you see in there prayer, supplication, thanksgiving and then requests?
[time=2905] I mean, it seems redundant.
[time=2907] Why didn't he just say, "Be anxious for nothing in everything, pray?" So I began to do a little research and I found out there were some nuances to each one of these words.
[time=2916] The first one, prayer, is the basic generic word in the Bible just to open the lines of communication with God.
[time=2924] It's just the average everyday word for prayer. Talk to God.
[time=2928] The next word, however, supplication has a very distinctive meaning.
[time=2932] And I wish we had time to go back into the Old Testament and develop it for you.
[time=2936] But it describes the humble cry of a dependent heart.
[time=2940] It describes the cry that comes out of a heart that knows that he is absolutely vulnerable to that future contingency.
[time=2947] It's out of his control, the downside is horrible, the upside would be fine, but it's not within my power to determine which way that thing is going to go.
[time=2959] To open the lines of communication, then to supplicate, to cry out and say, "God, I acknowledge that. I am dependent.
[time=2966] I am not an infinite, self-sufficient being. I am your creature, and I'm not in control of my world." And that frightens me at times, and it's frightening me right now with respect to the future contingency.
[time=2978] I'm in trouble, God.
[time=2982] The next word is Thanksgiving.
[time=2985] And I think in the context, it's fair to say that what he's asking us to do is to thank God in advance for the outcome of that future contingency.
[time=2995] Maybe we're waiting on some tests.
[time=2998] This is hypothetical from a medical exam. It's hypothetical for me, it may not be for you.
[time=3003] And the possibility of this test will reveal cancer, lethal cancer.
[time=3009] And you're waiting now these five days to hear from your doctor and to find out just how much trouble you might be in.
[time=3016] A future contingency, the downside is death. The upside is life.
[time=3020] The upside is the chance to continue to raise your children.
[time=3023] The upside is the girl old with your wife.
[time=3028] God is saying, "Open the lines of communication. Talk to me.
[time=3032] Come to me acknowledging that you are dependent upon me and that you're not in control of that test result and the cancer that it may reveal.
[time=3039] But right here and now, before you hear the result, thank me for what I'm going to do.
[time=3045] Thank me for what I'm going to do." And then this last word I love.
[time=3049] Request. Request means a specific petition, a specific petition.
[time=3057] And this is God our Heavenly Father to whom we cry Abba Father saying, "Yeah, I want you to pray and I want you to supplicate and I want you to thank me, regardless of what I'm going to do, but now what would you like?
[time=3069] How would you really like it to work out? I want to know.
[time=3072] Say it to me in detail.
[time=3074] Come before me in the sanctuary of your own heart and maybe with your wife and your kids and let's talk about, there's room in my kingdom for you to tell me not just what you ought to say, but what you really want." Doesn't mean he's going to give it, but it sure is good to know he's ready to hear it, doesn't it?
[time=3093] Our gracious God desires to hear the longing of your heart for how you're hoping your life might work.
[time=3102] Rejoice in the Lord always, but your forbearing spirit be known to all men.
[time=3108] Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication
[time=3114] with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." And look at verse 7, "The peace of God which surpasses all comprehension
[time=3123] shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." The word "guards" in verse 7 is an interesting word, it's a military term, and it describes some men whose job it was to stand at the city gate, but it's a peculiar word in that it does not describe what you'd naturally think.
[time=3141] Their job, of course, would be to protect people from getting in the city who shouldn't come in.
[time=3146] That's not what this word means.
[time=3148] This word describes a different function.
[time=3150] They stand at the gate and they guard who goes out.
[time=3155] It's their job to monitor flow out of the city, not into the city.
[time=3160] And as we're in the middle of a passage on anxiety, and as you and I know, when people struggle profoundly with anxiety,
[time=3170] even Christians struggling profoundly with anxiety, they begin to lose their what?
[time=3175] They begin to lose their faculties.
[time=3178] They begin to lose their heart and their mind.
[time=3182] And all kinds of difficult and strange behavior begins to develop in a person's life
[time=3190] who really struggles with anxiety.
[time=3193] Fears and phobias in an extreme sense, I'm not talking about the fear of height which many of you probably feel, I'm talking about a well-developed, serious case of anxiety.
[time=3202] People lose their mind.
[time=3204] What God is saying is give yourself to these principles, not as a quick fix,
[time=3210] not as something which instantly solves your problem, but you hang on to the truth of this and it will guard.
[time=3217] They will stand as watchmen at the city gate and they'll watch what goes out of your heart and your mind.
[time=3226] Now look at verse 8.
[time=3228] Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure,
[time=3234] whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things.
[time=3243] He's telling us to limit what we're allowed to think about in light of that future contingency.
[time=3249] I don't think it's good to say, every time I think about that, I get nervous so I don't think about it anymore.
[time=3254] Now we're back to denial again.
[time=3256] It's okay to think about it.
[time=3258] But the scriptures ask us to confine the thought and the musing and the meditation and those late hours at night when you can't sleep.
[time=3266] At least channel that to those dimensions about that future contingency, the good side or the bad side, to those things which are true, to those things which are honorable, right, pure, lovely, of good repute,
[time=3280] any excellence and worthy of praise.
[time=3285] We've got to be thinking rational human beings.
[time=3288] God gave us a mind.
[time=3289] It's not fair to say I won't think about it.
[time=3292] What he is saying is please focus your thoughts and don't allow yourself to run down all the what ifs so that you stir up the anxiety and you stir up the lack of faith and the fear.
[time=3310] Look at verse 9.
[time=3314] The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things
[time=3323] and the God of peace shall be with you.
[time=3326] Now I want you to notice the verb again practice these things.
[time=3329] It's a verb that is often used in scripture and it means to have as the habitual pattern of your life, the habitual characteristic pattern of your life.
[time=3340] If you're given to staying in great shape and you spend an hour to an hour and a half every day in exercising, maybe you're a runner or you're a biker or you're whatever you are, it would be true to say the practice of your life is exercise.
[time=3354] That's what this means. It doesn't mean you never don't do it.
[time=3358] It doesn't mean you're perfect. It just means practice these things.
[time=3361] Make them the pattern of your life. We'll make what the pattern of my life.
[time=3364] Look again at verse 9.
[time=3367] The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things.
[time=3373] What is that? That's their Bible.
[time=3376] All they had was Paul. All they had at this time in history was what Paul had shared with them, had shown them what they had received and heard and seen in him.
[time=3385] And what he's basically saying is that the underpinning to a life that is able to deal
[time=3391] with those traumatic events in such a way that anxiety doesn't overrule and we get into all kinds of trouble is a life of obedience, a life of obedience.
[time=3401] God desires from us a characteristic pattern of obedience, a foundation upon which windows, difficult days do come into our lives, we can begin to rejoice in the Lord always, to let the forbearing spirit be known, to be anxious for nothing, to let the requests be made known to God, to focus the mind, to dwell only on these things, and then to practice a life of obedience.
[time=3430] Notice that next to every one of these there's an absolute term, rejoice always for bearing spirit to all men, anxious for nothing, such an encouragement.
[time=3439] There is no circumstance in your life. These are absolute unconditional commands that is beyond the truth of this scripture.
[time=3446] As much as we'll struggle with it, God will struggle with us.
[time=3450] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra,
[time=3467] a solo from Read La Favour and a duet by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe.
[time=3472] The message today was from our special guest, Russell Moore.
[time=3475] Russ is the Vice President in charge of Student Affairs at Masters College in Santa Clarita, California.
[time=3481] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal savior,
[time=3487] I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3490] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3492] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins, and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3503] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3508] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3512] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3516] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
