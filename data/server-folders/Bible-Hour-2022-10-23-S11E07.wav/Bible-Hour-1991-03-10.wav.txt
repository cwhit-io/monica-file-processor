[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] (silence)
[time=53] It's not how much you make, it's how you want to live.
[time=56] Stick with us this morning as we look at Matthew 6, 19 to 24.
[time=60] Treasures in Heaven or Treasures on Earth.
[time=63] Treasures in Heaven are people.
[time=64] We are to invest our lives into the lives of people.
[time=69] (music)
[time=81] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=86] Thank you for joining us.
[time=88] Speaking today is Jim Ricker, Director of Stewardship Services Foundation.
[time=93] His message is entitled "Biblical Stewardship." We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study along with us.
[time=102] Special music today includes a song from the Praise Kids and a song from Lisa Renaker.
[time=111] Let's join our service with a song from the sanctuary choir entitled "Holy is He." (music)
[time=133] [MUSIC - 236 seconds]
[time=372] (dramatic music)
[time=380] [MUSIC - 128 seconds]
[time=512] (audience applauding)
[time=522] - At a privilege to sing again the songs that speak of the holiness of our Lord, there's a time in our lives when we need to come before the Lord and silent praise and worship and that's a time to take the time to speak with the Lord, as this song mentions here in 441, take time to be holy.
[time=544] We're gonna sing verses one, three, and four of hymn number 441.
[time=556] [MUSIC - 112 seconds]
[time=673] - Thank you for your good singing.
[time=677] We appreciate that very much.
[time=678] This is the springtime of the year approaching us, and this is the time for children's musicals.
[time=683] On March 17th in the evening service at 6 p.m., our praise kids will present the musical Shortstops.
[time=690] And they're here this morning singing one of the songs.
[time=692] They not only learn music and enjoy singing together, but learn some truths from God's word as they sing these songs.
[time=698] The song that they're gonna sing for you this morning is entitled Choices.
[time=702] Listen as they sing to you.
[time=704] [MUSIC] Choices are waiting just around the corner [MUSIC] Choices that have to be made [MUSIC] Some are polite, some are out of order [MUSIC] None of them want to wait [MUSIC] No wonder what to do at times like these [MUSIC] What is my action when [MUSIC] Shut up the world, say an honest prayer [MUSIC] Open the book and take a look at what's there [MUSIC] Choices [MUSIC] Choices [MUSIC] Little everyday things [MUSIC] That everyday brings [MUSIC] I will listen [MUSIC] To the spirit [MUSIC] And then makes a choice from the voice [MUSIC] That is Jesus to me [MUSIC] And then makes a choice from the voice [MUSIC] That is Jesus to me [MUSIC]
[time=792] [MUSIC - 95 seconds]
[time=892] (audience applauding) - We're really glad that you tuned into the Bible Hour this morning.
[time=899] Thank you very much.
[time=901] I want to tell you about an exciting event that's coming up in just a couple of weeks.
[time=905] On March 29th at the noon hour, we're going to have a good Friday service downtown at the Grand Wayne Center.
[time=911] This has been a tradition for us for a number of years now.
[time=914] We've had many people who go to our church but work in the downtown area that invite their friends to come for this very short but very important good Friday service.
[time=924] Again, I want to tell you the date that's Friday, March 29th.
[time=928] It'll be held from 1215 to 1245.
[time=931] We'll have some music, some drama, and the preaching from God's Word at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=938] I invite all of you to take that special time, especially if you work in that area.
[time=942] Take that noon hour and come and join with us in the Grand Ballroom of the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=950] We have a special guest with us today.
[time=952] We've been talking about his involvement in our church as it relates to stewardship.
[time=956] Jim Rickard is the Executive Director of the Stewardship Foundation in Newhall, California.
[time=962] Welcome, Jim.
[time=963] Glad to have you here.
[time=964] - Thank you.
[time=965] Great to be here.
[time=966] We're a number of months ago and helped us so much.
[time=969] I want to ask you a little bit about the Stewardship Services Foundation and just what's the real purpose of it?
[time=976] - Well, the name really identifies what it does.
[time=979] Pete, it's a stewardship ministry to churches and to God's people.
[time=983] We work with pastors on financial counseling.
[time=986] We do tax returns for pastors.
[time=987] We do family finance seminars, estate planning seminars, church leadership seminars.
[time=993] The whole thrust is just a quaint -- the people of God that the Bible does have a lot to say about the subject of money.
[time=999] - Well, I know that it's been a very -- it is a very important issue in churches.
[time=1002] I've grown up in churches.
[time=1004] I know that pastors have needed this advice in churches to help them.
[time=1008] And there are a number of people that don't even have wills that's very important.
[time=1012] And I know that you encourage that in your seminars.
[time=1015] We're glad to have you here today.
[time=1016] You're going to speak this morning.
[time=1017] Tell us a little bit about the subject of the morning.
[time=1020] So we're going to go to the text, Matthew 619-21, where your treasure is over.
[time=1024] Your heartbeat also is the key verse there.
[time=1026] Where we put our monies where our heart is.
[time=1028] That really tells the world what life is all about as far as our concerns and our priorities are.
[time=1033] We're going to look at treasures in heaven versus treasures on earth.
[time=1036] You know, treasures in heaven are people.
[time=1038] And as Christians, we should invest our lives and our resources and the lives of other people.
[time=1042] That's really what it's all about.
[time=1043] - That's great.
[time=1044] We're looking forward to your message, Jim.
[time=1046] We're also involved in master's colleagues.
[time=1049] Last week we had Russell Moore, who is the Vice President for Student Affairs.
[time=1052] He spoke here and you're the Chairman of the Board there.
[time=1055] Just an exciting school that also involves Dr. John MacArthur, who was here not too long ago.
[time=1060] We're delighted that we've had association with all of you.
[time=1063] The school has been a very important part of our lives and we certainly support the ministries that you have.
[time=1069] You have had exciting growth in the last couple of years, have you not?
[time=1072] - Well, we really have.
[time=1073] We've tripled in size in the last five years.
[time=1075] In fact, they just told us last year that we were the fastest growing Christian college in America, which is exciting.
[time=1080] It's just neat to be involved in the lives of young people today.
[time=1083] - Well, I'm glad for that and I appreciate your ministry, not only in the Stewardship Services Foundation, but at Master's College.
[time=1090] - Thank you.
[time=1091] - I want to tell you a little bit about a video tape that we have to offer to you.
[time=1096] It's by Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=1098] As I mentioned a few moments ago, he was here a few weeks ago and we taped that evening with Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=1104] Dr. MacArthur is a powerful Bible teacher and this video will just certainly confirm the fact that he loves to speak from God's Word.
[time=1113] We've entitled it an evening with Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=1116] If you'd like to receive this video cassette, you can receive it today by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1129] That's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1138] I hope that you have an opportunity to write forward and please enclose a gift of $15 to help defray the cost of providing that tape.
[time=1146] Well, Jim, as I mentioned, we had Russell Moore with us last week and he'll be coming back in just a couple weeks on March 24th to be an official candidate for the senior pastor of our church.
[time=1157] And we're really excited about that. You work very closely with Russ in his present capacity.
[time=1163] Yes, as being involved in a board like I have, Russ and I have worked together the last five years and I'll tell you, I'm excited about the prospect.
[time=1171] Russell is a neat guy. He can really communicate the Word of God well. He understands the Word of God. He studies the Word of God.
[time=1178] And more importantly, he lives it. He lives what he teaches. And it's a neat testimony and I'm excited for you.
[time=1184] That's great. We're looking forward to that date on March 24th. Russell Moore will be speaking to us.
[time=1190] We're glad that you tuned into the Bible Hour today. I hope that you'll remain for the rest of the program.
[time=1195] We'll have some more music and then the message from Jim Rickards. Stay with us, won't you?
[time=1214] Oh, God, mine. For thee are the fairies of sin I reside.
[time=1235] My gracious Lord, my Savior, my Lord, now.
[time=1249] You fell in love with me, my Jesus, Jesus, man.
[time=1263] I love thee because thou hast first loved me.
[time=1277] And her chest, my pardon, on Calvary's dream.
[time=1292] And love me for every, the friends of thy broad.
[time=1307] If ever I love thee, my Jesus, Jesus now.
[time=1321] [MUSIC - 34 seconds]
[time=1377] If ever I love thee, my love thee.
[time=1390] My Jesus, Jesus now.
[time=1399] If ever I love thee, Jesus now.
[time=1413] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1421] Thank you, Lisa, for that encouraging beautiful number this morning.
[time=1427] You saw no doubt in the bulletin, if you've already read, on the third page, the recommendation from the Search Committee to the Executive Board of Elders
[time=1437] to recommend Russ Moore to come and candidate as senior pastor of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1444] He'll be doing that at the invitation of the Elder Board on Sunday, March 24th.
[time=1450] He'll be here for the entire day, and then we will have the opportunity after the evening service to vote on him as our senior pastor.
[time=1460] There will be a report tonight in our service from our Search Committee Chairman Dale Seagland, and we are encouraging you to ask questions of the Search Committee of the Elder Board and the staff concerning Russ and his family so that you'll be well informed of them and who they are and what they stand for.
[time=1477] And I'm sure that tonight will be an important time for you to come and be aware of the information that Dale will give you.
[time=1485] This morning we have the privilege, again, of welcoming back to the pulpit Jim Rickard, and Jim is the Executive Director of Stewardship Services Foundation in Santa Clarita, California.
[time=1495] We have made an effort to emphasize stewardship in the next two Sundays at Blackhawk, and we're glad to have Jim back with us to give us some important information as it relates to giving as the Lord shows us how in God's Word.
[time=1508] I'm sure that that will be an important aspect of his message today, so I hope that you're ready with your Bibles to listen and join with Jim as he leads us in worship through the message.
[time=1517] Let's welcome Jim Rickard to the pulpit here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1521] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1527] Thank you. It's great to be back.
[time=1530] Well, sort of great to be back. I left 75 degree temperatures.
[time=1534] You know, I woke up this morning, and I saw some things on the ground that I don't usually see on the ground, and it wasn't mana.
[time=1542] [laughter] Well, I just -- I'm excited for you. I really am.
[time=1547] I've known Russ Moore for six years.
[time=1550] We've worked together at the college. I'm on the board, and he's the Vice President of Student Affairs.
[time=1555] And so, you know, you never know how God's going to direct, and you're hard in his heart, but I'm excited because I know Russ --
[time=1561] we fellowship together, we play golf together, you know, we've cried together a few times, and we've had the privilege of being involved in that college.
[time=1569] What I like about Russ is his genuineness.
[time=1572] What you see is what you get. You know, Russ loves life, and he loves Christ, you know, and he blends the two together very well.
[time=1580] And boy, I'll tell you, it's always centered around the Word of God, and he just loves the Lord with all his heart.
[time=1586] So, the prospect of him being the pastor here, I know a little bit about you. I've known of your church since I grew up with Dave Jeremiah and Toledo.
[time=1593] And so, I've been familiar. I followed his ministry and knew it when he was here, and I knew Rick a little bit, and I've known Pete Coby and his wife Carol for a number of years.
[time=1601] And then, to see a friend of mine being considered here is just a great privilege, and I'm excited.
[time=1607] I know Russ is passionate, and I know his passion is to teach the Word of God.
[time=1611] So, if you call him, that's what you're going to get, somebody that can really communicate the Word of God well.
[time=1621] I'll tell him that. That's great.
[time=1624] Tonight, we're going to look at some practical, some real practical things in the evening service, and we're going to look for it.
[time=1630] Look 12, look chapter 12, and I'm saying practical, practical in application.
[time=1635] When I was here before, I think I shared with you about five key financial principles.
[time=1640] Well, tonight, I'm going to share with you 13 key financial principles, and then we're going to look a little bit at the attributes of a spiritual leader.
[time=1647] And then afterwards, as Pete has already said, we're going to do a mini-will seminar. I just want to take about 30-35 minutes.
[time=1654] It's part of our ministry. Just to share with you some things about wills, living trusts, guardians.
[time=1660] What is joint Tennessee? What happens in Indiana if you die in test state without a will?
[time=1665] How do you pass your stay from spouse to spouse, and then from spouse to spouse to your loved ones into the Lord's work?
[time=1671] We'll allow about five or ten minutes I trust for Q&A, and there'll be some handouts.
[time=1675] So, it'll be short, but I trust it'll be very informative.
[time=1679] Well, with that in mind, I'd like for you to take your Bibles this morning and turn to Matthew chapter 6.
[time=1684] Matthew chapter 6, verses 6, Matthew chapter 6 verses 19 to 24, excuse me.
[time=1694] Matthew 6, 19 to 24, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust death corrupt,
[time=1701] and where thieves break through and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust death corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
[time=1710] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[time=1714] The light of the body is the eye. If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
[time=1720] But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
[time=1724] Therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?
[time=1729] No man can serve two masters, or either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise you.
[time=1736] Either you cannot serve God in mammon, you cannot serve God in riches, you cannot serve God in treasures.
[time=1743] You could look at verse 20 there, and you could say earthly treasures corrupt.
[time=1747] Look around us, you can see it, SNL crisis, et cetera.
[time=1752] You could look at verses 22 and 23, and you could say yearning for earthly treasures, blind your spiritual vision.
[time=1759] Once we get caught into the trap of wanting more and more and more, it will blind our spiritual vision as Christians.
[time=1766] Then you look at 24, and you could say earthly treasures tend to draw you away from serving God.
[time=1772] Earthly treasures tend to draw you away from serving God.
[time=1777] Two years ago, we saw something that I think startled everyone.
[time=1782] Three years ago, we would have never predicted it, and that was the fall of the Iron Curtain.
[time=1788] Berlin Wall came down.
[time=1790] And again, we were confronted with an economic system vastly different from our own.
[time=1795] We had heard about it, but for the first time we had a first hand glimpse of it.
[time=1800] Happened again in the recent Persian Gulf War.
[time=1804] As you watched television, and you watched those Arab countries, and how those people live over there,
[time=1810] you quickly determined that there's a vast difference in our economic systems.
[time=1816] We're the most prosperous nation on the face of the Earth, and obviously many of those countries are not.
[time=1822] They are third world countries.
[time=1824] We do live in a world of contrast.
[time=1827] A couple years ago, after the Iron Curtain fell, a friend of mine went and visited the Soviet Union.
[time=1832] I had the privilege about eight years ago of going to the Philippines for three weeks.
[time=1836] That was a culture shock for me. It's something I had never experienced.
[time=1840] I grew up in the United States of America. I grew up with a silver spoon in my mouth.
[time=1843] And I had never been outside these borders until I went to the Philippines.
[time=1847] It took me about three days just to adjust to that culture. Very different.
[time=1852] Then I sat down with this friend of mine when he returned from the Soviet Union, and we talked about his trip there, and he began to share the contrast.
[time=1860] And I thought I'd seen it all in the Philippines. I discovered that I hadn't, really.
[time=1866] So we summarized this trip to the Soviet Union. Let me share it with you. It goes like this.
[time=1871] If you go visit the Eastern Bloc, you would exchange your dollars for rubles.
[time=1877] Twenty-two rubles per dollar in the last exchange. Twenty-two rubles per dollar.
[time=1883] The average heart surgeon's income in the Soviet Union is 130 rubles per month.
[time=1890] That's $5.91 a month. McDonald's restaurant opened its largest restaurant in Moscow recently.
[time=1899] I understand they had over 25,000 applications to work there from Soviet citizens.
[time=1905] The average worker's income at the McDonald's restaurant in Moscow is 400 rubles per month.
[time=1913] Did you get that? The surgeon makes 130 rubles. The McDonald's employee makes 400 rubles.
[time=1921] The average worker in the Soviet Union makes between $5 and $6 a month.
[time=1926] So third world country, hardly no buildings have been built after 1917. No light bulbs.
[time=1935] Hard to find things like toilet paper. You have to bite on the black market. There's a large black market.
[time=1942] There's no computers. They visited a hospital and the surgeons asked them and begged them for surgical thread.
[time=1950] When you get back to America, would you send us surgical thread?
[time=1954] There's no free enterprise. There's no incentives.
[time=1958] Up to two years ago, they were told they were the most advanced people living in the most advanced nation in the face of the globe.
[time=1965] And then American videos started to flood the market.
[time=1970] And somehow they got access to video players. They soon discovered they had been lied to. They had been deceived.
[time=1976] They were not the most advanced. They were really a third world country.
[time=1980] The average church service in the Soviet Union lasts from two and a half to four hours.
[time=1985] They're so hungry for the Word of God. And that's the preaching service.
[time=1989] Really enjoyed the music here this morning. Beautiful, beautiful music.
[time=1993] But that's not including the music. You can imagine if a preacher preaches from two and a half to four hours,
[time=1999] Pete Coby would probably have this choir up here for at least one to two hours, right?
[time=2004] Great music. They have meetings on Tuesday nights, Thursday nights, Saturday nights, Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings.
[time=2012] And when the doors are open, those people are there. They're so hungry.
[time=2016] One day they were traveling from one church to another. They were stopped at a checkpoint by a militia man just as they got out of the city limits.
[time=2023] And he took the driver out of the van and took him to the back of the van and detained him for about 15 minutes.
[time=2028] He let him go. The driver gets back in the van. They drive on and the passengers obviously very concerned.
[time=2034] One was John MacArthur. He says, "What was that all about?" The fella says, "Well, he saw the van parked in front of our church." So this militia man assumed that the church owned the van. He asked me for information about his soul.
[time=2048] They're that hungry.
[time=2052] 75% of the church are older women. Why? Their husbands are either in prison or they're dead.
[time=2059] There's no pride or egos, no luxuries, no pictures on walls in their homes.
[time=2064] Maybe a calendar, that's all. No ownership, no success stories, no wealth, no savings, no prepared foods, no independent spirit.
[time=2074] They'll stand in line for hours for a loaf of bread.
[time=2078] They ask one of the fellas, "Aren't you concerned missing work and standing in line for hours for a loaf of bread?"
[time=2084] No, no, no. My employer is in the same line.
[time=2087] They have a submissive spirit. Why? They've been crushed. Their spirits have been crushed.
[time=2092] But they're very generous people. They give you the shirt off their back.
[time=2096] In the United States of America, we have all we need. We stockpile things. Nobody needs, right?
[time=2102] In the United States of America, we worship egos, wealth, power, our stature in life.
[time=2109] Oh, do we live in a world of contrast.
[time=2112] I was driving with my wife from Fresno to San Francisco. The other day, we were listening to Rush Limbaugh.
[time=2119] He is at AM radio station out of New York City. He's telling this true story happened to do with Alaska oil spill.
[time=2127] The story goes on to say that when the Alaskan oil spill occurred, the animal rights movement made a move on Washington.
[time=2134] And they wanted money set aside to rescue the otters that had been impacted by the Alaskan oil spill.
[time=2140] Because of their aggressive posture, they won their day and there was money set aside.
[time=2144] So they rented some helicopters and they scoured the beaches of Alaska to find otters that had been impacted by the oil.
[time=2151] When they find an otter, they'd land. They'd rescue the otter, put the otter in the helicopter, take it to an otter rehab center.
[time=2158] This is the world of contrast. They'd take the otter to the center and then they would clean it up with soap and water.
[time=2165] The cost, $82,000 per otter. That's documented. $82,000 per otter.
[time=2173] The day came when they were going to release the first otter back into the wild. They announced the location of the release.
[time=2179] Animal rights people showed up. The helicopter lands. They take the cage out of the helicopter and put it on the beach.
[time=2184] Crowds cheering. They had a band. The band was playing. The otter jumps into the ocean, swims out to the breakwater.
[time=2192] Gets at a breakwater and out from beneath the waves comes a killer whale.
[time=2197] He ate the otter. The band stopped playing. The crowd stopped cheering. And the whale said, "Thanks for lunch."
[time=2213] $82,000 snack. In 1988, we spent millions of dollars to rescue two whales. Thousands of dollars to save an otter, millions of dollars to save a whale.
[time=2229] Yet we abort babies. And I'm told some of the same people that petitioned to save the otters and to save the whales of the same people that are petitioning to abort the babies.
[time=2240] World of contrast deceived. Look at the Soviet Union. We look at the Persian Gulf. We see poverty. We come back to the United States and we see unbelievable wealth.
[time=2253] Unbelievable wealth. Well, I'm here to talk to you about money. That's what I do. That's what our ministry does.
[time=2260] And Pete already introduced the subject on giving. It's a sensitive subject. I know it's a sensitive subject. Not because it's so personal necessarily, but because it's been so abused today.
[time=2271] You know, I feel abused as you read and you see that the TV, electronic issues where they just ask and ask and ask and ask continually, little preaching, a whole lot of asking.
[time=2282] And as a result, there's an overreaction to that. And a lot of pastors today and a lot of churches avoid this subject.
[time=2288] But we're supposed to teach the whole counsel of God. And you know, I don't know about Jew people, but I need to be taught in that area.
[time=2296] I don't know all the answers. I need to be reminded. I battle the same battles you do. I face the same temptations that you do.
[time=2303] I had the same demands in my budget that you do. I just have the privilege every Sunday of reminding myself about the demands in my budget.
[time=2311] So that's what we're going to do. We're going to just look at a couple of verses this morning. We just have a few minutes left.
[time=2316] So take your Bibles, will you, and turn to Matthew 6? Back to Matthew 6. I just want to look at these verses just a little bit in depth.
[time=2323] 19 and 20, "Lay not up for yourself treasures upon earth, where moth and rust death corrupt and where thieves break through and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust death corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal."
[time=2339] Jesus is not advocating poverty here. It's not what he's talking about. Poverty is not a means to spirituality.
[time=2346] In fact, as you read the Word of God, only one time did the Lord Jesus ever tell anybody to sell his possessions and give it to the poor, and that's the rich young ruler.
[time=2355] Why did he do that? The Lord knew his heart. The Lord knew that he worshiped that money, that his heart was so involved in his resources there was no way he was going to give his heart to God as long as he had that wealth.
[time=2367] God knew that. God knew his heart. So he tested him. He said, "You give away your wealth and come and follow me." He said, "No, I can't do that."
[time=2374] That's the only time in Scripture. The Lord Jesus said to do that, and there was a reason for that.
[time=2379] In both testaments, the old and the new, we recognize the right for material wealth or possessions, including money, land, animals, houses, clothing.
[time=2389] It's all through the Old and the New Testament. First Timothy 6, 17, God gives us all things to enjoy. He tells us, "Look at Job. Look at Solomon. Look at Abraham. Look at Zacchaeus. Look at Philemon. He had slaves. Nothing wrong with having things. Nothing wrong with living in a nice home. Nothing wrong with driving in a nice car. Nothing wrong with wearing nice clothes. Nothing wrong with having a savings account. It's the attitude.
[time=2418] That's it. It's bottom line. This text is so important. Is it treasures in heaven or is it treasures on earth? Listen, treasures in heaven are people. Treasures in heaven are people. The world buys friendships.
[time=2432] We're to invest our lives and our resources into people for heaven. That's the whole point. That's why we're here to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ with our lives into the lives of other people.
[time=2446] Look at 21 there. For where your treasure is, or will your heart be also? Bottom line, key verse of this whole text. For where your treasure is, or will your heart be also? Listen, they will both be earthly or they will both be heavenly. Think of that. You cannot have your heart in heaven and your treasures on earth. It doesn't work.
[time=2469] If your treasure is on earth, your heart is on earth. If your heart is legitimately in heaven, your treasures will be in heaven. How I handle my money is a testimony of what my life is really all about. It's the barometer.
[time=2487] There's a saying as Christians, we will never handle anything less significant than money nor more outwardly indicative of our inward spiritual condition. That's 621.
[time=2499] Want to take a look at your life, gratitude towards money. Look at your priorities. Where do I put my money? It's my value system. It's where I put my money. What's really important to me is where I put my money. Bottom line, easiest way to measure it.
[time=2515] John MacArthur has written a commentary on the book of Matthew. I'm quoting him here. If the heart is right, everything else in life falls into its proper place. The person who is right with the Lord will be generous and happy and is given to the Lord's work.
[time=2530] By the same token, a person who has covetous, self-indulgent, and stingy has good reason to question his relationship with the Lord.
[time=2542] Look at 22 and 23. The light of the body is the eye. If therefore the eye be single, the whole body should be full of light. But if the eye be evil, the whole body should be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, the question then, how great is that darkness?
[time=2559] Here the eye becomes an illustration of the heart. That's what these two verses are saying. Our eye is how our body takes in light. Therefore, it's our only means of vision. It comes through the eye.
[time=2575] The heart is the eye of the soul. Our heart is the eye of the soul. It is through our heart that God's truth, His love, His peace, and every other spiritual blessing comes to us, through our hearts.
[time=2593] When our heart, our spiritual eye, is clear, our whole life will be flooded with spiritual understanding. When the eye is bad, the heart is selfish. The person who is materialistic and greedy is spiritually blind.
[time=2613] It's not what you make. It's how well you want to live. That's the point. Not how much you make is how well you want to live. I counsel with couples that make $15,000 a year with three children and pay all their bills. I counsel with a couple that makes $100,000 a year with one child, and I can't make their next house payment. That's not uncommon, especially where I live.
[time=2634] Listen, nothing wrong with having an income of $50,000 a year. We live in a day and age of big industry and big contracts. Nothing wrong with $50,000 a year. That's not a lot of money.
[time=2645] What's wrong is a $50,000 a year lifestyle. If God has prospered you somehow, where you make $100,000 a year, nothing wrong with that. $100,000 lifestyle is what's wrong.
[time=2657] Listen, God does not prosper a Christian businessman in his business so he can go from afford to a Cadillac. He prospers at Christian businessman in his business so he can contribute to the gospel of Christ. That's the point.
[time=2671] And when we use that prosperity to self-indulge, we've missed the whole point. And it won't be long before it'll blind our spiritual vision. Folks, that's bottom line.
[time=2680] Yes, I'm poor to sort of into this thing. As I travel the country, I just amaze what I see going on in churches today. Listen, the lifestyle of America, the materialism has not creeped into our churches. It has bolted into our churches.
[time=2693] And it's time that we as God's people stood back and said, "Hey, what's life all about here? What really matters? What's really important?"
[time=2703] I spoke in a church in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. I got done speaking. I was standing at a door greeting people. An elderly lady came through. She was 108 years old. She introduced me to her son. He was 87.
[time=2716] I said to her, "Ma'am, I couldn't help." I said, "Ma'am, 108. This was about four years ago. She was born three years after the Custer fight. She was 36 years old in the Titanic sunk. You talk about history. That lady was history."
[time=2729] I said to her, "Ma'am, I said, "What's life all about?" Nobody ever asked her that question. I said, "Oh, you've been a Christian." She says, "90 years."
[time=2737] She had 11 children. She could tell you the dates. Every one of those kids were one to Christ. Every one of them. When they gave their heart to Christ, she could tell the date of every one of them.
[time=2746] She just bubbled over with what being involved in the Lord's work has meant to her. As she looked back over her life, you could just see it, just oozing out.
[time=2756] Folks, as you go down life's pathway, as you look back, what really mattered, what's really important, what really counts. It's the treasures in heaven. It's not the treasures on earth. They're fleeting.
[time=2770] Look at Solomon. All is vanity. It's fleeting. It is. You look back three years ago. You're not going to remember where your money went three years ago. You're probably not going to remember who won the World Series three years ago.
[time=2781] Let alone where you went on vacation or what you did or how you spent this or that, but you remember you're involved in the Lord's work.
[time=2789] That's the point. Verse 24 there, "The therefore I say unto you," no, they're verse 24, "No man can serve two masters. If you really hate the one in love the other, else he will hold to the one who despises you. You cannot serve God in Mammon. You cannot serve God in riches. You can't serve God in money.
[time=2809] The motto today is, "I want what I want and I want it now. I'll even go into debt to get it." I like the qualifications of a spiritual leader in Titus chapter 1.
[time=2820] It says there in verse 9, "Hold fast the faithful word." I like that. In other words, know the word of God so that it comes out even in casual conversation, same principle with money.
[time=2831] If I'm sensitive to the things of God, I'll manage my money so that I am never compromised. My testimony is never compromised. It's automatic. It's a pattern of living.
[time=2842] I won't buy into the system of the day. I won't cheat on my income tax return.
[time=2848] When I take my wife out to a restaurant and she gets a salad bar and I get a sandwich, I won't mooch off of her salad bar because that's integrity issue. It's bottom line. It's how I live. It's my lifestyle.
[time=2860] You can't serve God in riches. You can't serve God in treasures. You can't have your one foot in heaven. The other one on earth doesn't work. Can't compartmentalize it. It's a package.
[time=2870] Quickly, three basic principles of money. Number one, the danger of money. The danger of money. We're not to love it. 1 Timothy 6, 10.
[time=2879] The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. It's not to control us. You can love it and not have it.
[time=2886] You know, just people with money are not the only greedy people. People who do not have money can be greedy people. They can love it and not have it, always seeking it.
[time=2896] We're not to trust it. 1 Timothy 6, 17. Charge them that are rich in this world that they may be not be high-minded nor fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2907] I like Proverbs 18 to 11. The rich man thinks of his wealth as an impregnable defense. A high wall of safety. What a dreamer it says.
[time=2917] Look at Donald Trump. Look at Jim Baker. Look at those men that have been caught up in the SNL crisis, conceited, arrogant people. Look at him today. They've been humbled.
[time=2930] Keep it simple, folks. Keep your life simple. Don't confound it. Getting involved in the things of this world. Keep it basic.
[time=2939] Meet your needs. Meet your families' needs. Meet those in need outside of your family. Give to the Lord's work.
[time=2947] I like Larry Burkett. He has a statement. You cannot be financially bound and spiritually free. It's a great statement.
[time=2953] You cannot be financially bound and spiritually free. You can't do it. That's the one foot in heaven and one foot on earth.
[time=2963] We are not to seek to be rich for Timothy 6-9. Work hard for his glory. God prospers you. Wonderful. They use it for the Lord's work.
[time=2974] I contrast two friends of mine. Both have been successful in their businesses. One made his money in real estate. I've known him for 20 years.
[time=2982] The one that made his money in real estate, he loved Christ. But he was never satisfied with what he had. Always wanted more. More and more.
[time=2991] He was very selfish. He gave dollars to the Lord's work when he could have given hundreds of dollars to the Lord's work. His greed led to his downfall.
[time=3000] He got risky. Today, he's lost it all, his money, his peace of mind, his happiness. He's aged beyond his years. Why? His treasures were on earth. They weren't in heaven.
[time=3010] Then I have a second friend who also retired 20 years ago, built a successful business. He said, "Enough is enough." He had to come and say, "Hey, what is enough enough?" He said, "I've come to the nut. Point's enough. I've got enough." How's that?
[time=3023] He sold his business. Retired. Put his money into a savings account in some investments, secured investments, clips to coupons.
[time=3032] You know what he does? He gives the God. He gives faithfully. In fact, he gives his principle away. He has a favorite statement. "I'm sending it on to heaven, Jim. I've been killing the goose that laid to golden egg, and I'm sending it on to heaven." It's a great statement.
[time=3046] Very active at the GRB, one of the most faithful givers in the GRB fellowship, for years. He's one of the godliest, happiest, most faithful and contented persons I have ever met.
[time=3058] The difference was an attitude. One had his treasure in heaven again, one had his treasure on earth. The more this guy gives, the more God blesses. It's amazing.
[time=3071] We're not to regard it as our own. That's Leviticus 25, 23, says the land is mine. Psalm 24 says, "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness they are out of the world, and they that dwell therein."
[time=3083] Haggiah 2.8 says, "The silver and the gold is mine." That's why the qualifications for spiritual leadership in 1 Timothy is so important.
[time=3091] It says, "Free from the love of money." It's supposed to be a man of good reputation if he's in spiritual leadership. That means even among the lost.
[time=3101] It says, "Not fond of sordid gain." In other words, "Not involved in shady business practices."
[time=3109] Spiritual leader is above reproach as God steward. That means he has a good reputation even among the lost.
[time=3116] Even among the lost. It says he's to be hospitable. That means he's generous with his blessings.
[time=3124] Now, how are we to spend our money? 1 Timothy 5, 8. He provides for his own, not for his own.
[time=3131] Even for those of his own household, hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel, by providing for our families, by paying our bills, by saving. Proverbs 13, 11.
[time=3143] Dishonous money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow.
[time=3151] 3. How are we to give our money? How are we to give our money? Let's look at the history of giving.
[time=3158] In Genesis chapter 47 and chapter 41, God told Joseph there was going to be a famine in Egypt. Remember that?
[time=3165] The people were commanded to give one-fifth of their land production.
[time=3170] In Leviticus 27, they were required to give a tenth to the priests. In Deuteronomy 12 and 14, they were required to give another tenth to fund national holidays and feasts.
[time=3181] Deuteronomy 14, another tenth to the poor every third year.
[time=3185] So you just go from Leviticus to Deuteronomy, they were given 23 and a third percent of their income.
[time=3191] Proverbs chapter 3, 9 and 10 says, "The more generous, the better the harvest."
[time=3197] Proverbs 11, 24 and 5 says, "You want to lose your money, hoard it. You want to gain money, scatter it, and God will bless you."
[time=3205] Luke 638 says, "Given who will be given to you, good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will pour into your lap," it says.
[time=3216] For whatever measure you deal out to others, it will be dealt to you in return. In other words, if you are generous, you will receive generosity.
[time=3226] If you are generous, you will receive generosity.
[time=3231] Luke 19, 8 and 9 is a story of Zacchaeus' conversion. Remember that?
[time=3236] After he was saved, he said, "Lord, behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor.
[time=3243] If I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much." Jesus didn't even tell him to do that. He just did that out of a heart of love.
[time=3254] A believer who truly loves Christ has a giving heart, that's the point.
[time=3258] How much are you to give to the Lord? 1 Corinthians 16, 2 says, "God has prospered you."
[time=3264] What does that mean? I think when you study Scripture, my wife and I have taken that, start with a tenth.
[time=3270] Start with a tenth, and then give above that as God dictates through your heart.
[time=3277] How often are you to give? Again, 1 Corinthians 16 every day and the first day of the week.
[time=3282] Constantly, as you receive income, give some of the Lord.
[time=3286] I tell people you are going to raise the salary. How about giving some of the Lord and saving the difference?
[time=3290] What? Going to get a bonus? Give some of the God and save it.
[time=3294] I counseled with somebody the other day. I said, "I'm getting a bonus in April." I said, "Well, that's great. What are you going to do with it? Well, we've already spent it." I said, "You have? You don't even have it? What do you do? What do you do?" What we've recarped at the house? Oh, did you ever think about giving some of the God and saving it?
[time=3308] That was foreign. Save it? Give it to the Lord?
[time=3314] Where are you to give to the Lord? How about the local church? 1 Corinthians 16, 2 says, "Lay in store."
[time=3320] Acts 4, 34 and 35, the proceeds were laid at the apostles' feet and the apostles' distributed according to need.
[time=3328] So give into the church. Think of it this way. Think of it this way.
[time=3335] The Son of God came down from heaven's glory to reside on a wicked earth, to be born in a stable.
[time=3345] His life was threatened by Herod. The Pharisee said he was of the devil.
[time=3351] He was denied, rejected, betrayed, and mocked. They spat in his face, beat him with their fists, put a crowd of thorns on his head,
[time=3359] and then in a final act, Pilate scourged him and delivered him over to be crucified, and he was crucified.
[time=3367] Jesus Christ did this for you and for me. Why? So we could have forgiveness of sin and eternal life.
[time=3375] All we have to do is accept him as our Lord and Savior. And you mean I can't give a measly ten percent to propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[time=3387] Folks, that's bottom line. Ten percent to spread the gospel, to tell the world his wonderful story.
[time=3396] The piercing eye of the watching Christ looks not at your proper goal, not what did you give as his searching test, but how much did you withhold?
[time=3406] The danger of money, does it control you? How we spend our money, take care of your needs, your family's needs, those outside your family, give the Lord's work?
[time=3416] How we give our money?
[time=3418] Oh, Christian, remember you bear his dear name. Your life is for others to view. A living example men praise you or blame and measure your Savior by you.
[time=3449] We've been sharing with you music from our sanctuary choir. Our young people's choir praise kids and soloist Lisa Reniker.
[time=3463] The message today was from our special guest, Jim Rickard.
[time=3467] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3475] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3482] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to be my Savior and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3490] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3494] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3498] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
