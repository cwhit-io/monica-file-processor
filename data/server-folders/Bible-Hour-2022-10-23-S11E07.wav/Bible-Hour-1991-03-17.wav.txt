[time=127] Are the fires of your Christian commitment burning brightly?
[time=130] Or have you allowed them to go out?
[time=132] Stay with us for the Bible hour.
[time=134] [MUSIC]
[time=146] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour.
[time=152] Thank you for joining us.
[time=154] Speaking today is Dr. Paul House from Taylor University.
[time=158] His message is entitled "Is the Bush Still Burning?" His text is found in the book of Exodus chapter 3 verses 1 through 15.
[time=167] Special music today includes a solo from Chad Veneta and a song from Reflection.
[time=175] Let's join our service with a song from the sanctuary choir and soloist Marilyn Wong entitled "He's Been Faithful."
[time=183] [MUSIC]
[time=203] In my moments of fear, through every pain, every tear, there's a God who's been faithful to me.
[time=227] When my strength was all gone, when my heart had no song, still in love, he'd be faithful to me.
[time=249] Every word he's promised is true.
[time=260] What I thought was impossible, I see my God too.
[time=274] He's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=288] Looking back, his love and mercy, I see.
[time=299] Though in my heart, I have questioned even how to be me.
[time=310] Yet he's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=325] [MUSIC]
[time=331] When my heart looked away, the many times I could not breath.
[time=342] Still, my God, he was faithful to me.
[time=353] The days I spent, so so crucial, reaching out for what pleased me.
[time=365] Even then, God was faithful to me.
[time=376] Every time I come back, to me.
[time=387] He is waiting with open arms, and I'll see once again.
[time=401] He's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=416] Looking back, his love and mercy, I see.
[time=426] Though in my heart, I have questioned even to believe.
[time=437] Yet he's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=450] I have questioned even now to be me.
[time=459] Yet he's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=465] I have questioned even now to be me.
[time=477] Yet he's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=513] [APPLAUSE]
[time=519] The Lord is good, and he leads us every day as we commit our ways to him.
[time=524] 461, please.
[time=526] He leadeth me, O blessed thought, will sing all three verses of 461.
[time=532] [MUSIC]
[time=548] He leadeth me, O blessed thought.
[time=594] [MUSIC]
[time=616] He leadeth me, O blessed thought.
[time=693] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=695] We continue with music now.
[time=696] Chad Venet is going to sing a song.
[time=698] It's entitled, "Watch the Lamb." Has a complete message in it.
[time=701] Listen carefully to the words in music as he sings.
[time=704] [MUSIC]
[time=712] My two small sons, they walked beside me on the road.
[time=730] The reason that they came was to watch the Lamb.
[time=738] [MUSIC]
[time=744] Daddy, Daddy, what will we see there?
[time=751] There's so much we don't understand.
[time=760] So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham.
[time=768] And I said, "Do children watch the Lamb?"
[time=777] Well, there will be so many in Jerusalem today.
[time=786] We must be sure the Lamb doesn't run away.
[time=795] So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham.
[time=805] And I said, "Do children watch the Lamb?"
[time=814] When we reached the city, I knew something must be wrong.
[time=823] There were no joy for worshipers.
[time=827] No joy for worship songs.
[time=831] I stood there with my children in the midst of every man.
[time=840] And I heard the crowd cry out.
[time=845] [MUSIC]
[time=855] We tried to leave the city, but we could not get away.
[time=864] We were forced to play in this drama, a part I did not wish to play.
[time=873] Why were we standing here where soon they would pass by?
[time=881] Why on this day were men condemned to die?
[time=888] I looked and said, "Even now they come."
[time=897] The first one cried for mercy.
[time=901] The people gave him none.
[time=905] The second one was violent.
[time=909] He was arrogant and loud.
[time=914] The second he was angry.
[time=924] And now they said, "There's Jesus, and I'm scared to be my eyes."
[time=933] A man so badly beaten.
[time=937] He barely looked alive.
[time=942] A heart from his body, from his arms upon his brow.
[time=950] Running down the cross and falling to the ground.
[time=957] I watched him as he struggled.
[time=962] I watched him as he fell.
[time=966] The cross came down upon his back.
[time=971] The crowd began to yell.
[time=974] In that moment I felt such agony.
[time=983] Until a Roman soldier grabbed my arm and screamed, "You carry his cross."
[time=995] At first I tried to resist him.
[time=1005] Then his hand reached for his sword.
[time=1011] And so I knelt and took the cross from the lorn.
[time=1020] I placed it on my shoulder.
[time=1024] I started down the street.
[time=1029] The blood that he'd been shedding was running down my cheek.
[time=1036] They led us to Galga.
[time=1040] They drove nailed deep in his feet and hands.
[time=1046] Yet upon the cross I heard him pray.
[time=1050] Father forgive them.
[time=1055] You never have I seen such a love in any other eyes.
[time=1065] Into thy hands I commit my spirit.
[time=1069] You pray, many times.
[time=1075] I stood for what seemed like years.
[time=1080] I'd lost all sense of time.
[time=1085] Until I felt too tiny hands.
[time=1089] Holding tight to mine.
[time=1093] My children stood there weeping.
[time=1097] I heard the oldest say.
[time=1102] Father please forgive us.
[time=1106] Lamb ran away.
[time=1115] Daddy, Daddy, what have we seen here?
[time=1127] There's so much we don't understand.
[time=1137] So I took them in my arms.
[time=1141] We turned and faced the rush.
[time=1145] And I said, "You children, watch the land."
[time=1166] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=1168] We're glad you've tuned in today.
[time=1170] This is the month of March and in Indiana that means that there are a lot of changes taking place.
[time=1175] Just the other day in the morning we had snow and by afternoon there was a beautiful sunny day.
[time=1180] And we are looking forward to green grass and leaves on the trees in just a few days.
[time=1185] It's a very exciting time to see God work and change the picture here of the earth right here in Indiana.
[time=1193] I have some announcements for you and some special events I'd like to have you take note of and I hope that you can join with us.
[time=1199] The first one is a good Friday service on March 29th.
[time=1203] We're going to hold that in the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne and it will be from 1215 to 1245.
[time=1210] If you work in that area, we hope that you'll come and join with us for that special time of blessing on Good Friday.
[time=1217] We're going to have some drama, some music and a message from our Associate Pastor Steve Longbreak.
[time=1222] Once again, that's on Good Friday, March 29th, 1215 to 1245 at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=1232] Just two weeks ago, we had a special guest. His name was Russell Moore.
[time=1236] I'm pleased to announce that the Elder Board has invited Russell and his wife Heidi to come back and join with us next Sunday, March 24th,
[time=1243] and be a candidate for Senior Pastor of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1247] We're praying that God will lead in a special way in Russell and Heidi's lives and also in the life of Blackhawk
[time=1253] so that if this is God's will that He comes as our Senior Pastor, we would be very, very pleased.
[time=1259] So join with us next Sunday morning and listen to Russell speak from God's Word.
[time=1264] Also, I want to tell you about our Easter services. If you're not in the habit of going to church, we want to invite you to Blackhawk Baptist Church on Easter Sunday morning, March 31st.
[time=1274] We'll have a great praise service in the morning celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1279] And in the evening, we're going to title our program Easter in Scenes and Songs.
[time=1284] That will be at 6 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church on Easter Sunday, March 31st.
[time=1291] We've had some wonderful special guests who have spoken to us from God's Word and inspired our hearts and today is no exception. We're glad to welcome to the Pope of today Dr. Paul House from Taylor University.
[time=1302] Good morning, Paul. Good morning. It's good to be with you today.
[time=1305] Thank you. We've had a number of times that we've chatted on the telephone, but we haven't had opportunity to meet each other in person.
[time=1311] I'm glad to have you here, and I look forward to the message today.
[time=1315] Paul, we talked about your unique ministry of being at Taylor for some five years, and yet at the same time,
[time=1321] while teaching students the Word of God, you've been active preaching.
[time=1325] What's the correlation there? How do you feel that's important?
[time=1328] I think it's important, first of all, because when I was called to ministry at age 12, I sensed a call to preach.
[time=1334] And I was raised Baptist, of course, so they put me in the pulpit fairly soon after that.
[time=1339] So all through high school and college, I preached the Word, and so I still see myself primarily as one who preaches the Word.
[time=1346] I think it's also important, though, to stay in touch with what's going on in churches, to understand church people,
[time=1352] to understand what our students are seeing when they go out from Taylor.
[time=1357] And so I see it as a dual ministry and really preaching as another way that I can teach.
[time=1362] Well, that's great, Paul. We have enjoyed Taylor University with its close proximity to Black Hawk with students coming up
[time=1369] and ministering to us, and there are a number of students that have attended Taylor over the years from Black Hawk.
[time=1375] And we're glad for professors like you that are dedicated to the Word, also interested in what's going on when those students leave the campus and get into everyday life.
[time=1386] And I'm glad for your ministry, and we look forward. What's the title of your message this morning?
[time=1390] I'll be preaching from Exodus chapter 3, and I'll be calling the sermon "Is the Bush Still Burning?"
[time=1396] and talking about Christian commitment.
[time=1398] Well, I appreciate that, and we're going to be looking forward to your message in just a few moments.
[time=1403] Just before we go back to the live portion of our program, I'd like to remind you that we are offering this month
[time=1409] a video cassette of the message given by Dr. John MacArthur just a few weeks ago here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1416] We're entitling it an evening with Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=1420] Dr. MacArthur is a real scholar of the Word, and this message will be an inspiration to you.
[time=1426] You can receive this video cassette of Dr. MacArthur by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1438] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1446] We're asking if you write for the cassette that you would enclose a gift of $15 or more to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=1456] We go back to the live portion of our service now as we listen to Reflection, a minister to us, and then the message from Dr. Paul House.
[time=1464] Stay with us, won't you?
[time=1486] [MUSIC] I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold [MUSIC] I'd rather have Jesus than riches and toll [MUSIC] I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land [MUSIC] I'd rather be land by His nail piercings [MUSIC] than to be the king of a vast domain [MUSIC] and be held in sin, straight swaying [MUSIC] I'd rather have Jesus than anything [MUSIC] this world abodes today [MUSIC]
[time=1577] [MUSIC - 76 seconds]
[time=1673] ♪
[time=1686] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=1691] Our Father, as we look over the audience as we know again, as we've worked throughout the week with people that have had difficulties, we want to just take a moment and thank the Lord that we can come before you and that we can ask you for your help.
[time=1705] Today we think of people that have been in serious accidents.
[time=1710] We think of Rodney Ware, we think of Nick Leininger, and we pray that you'll just heal their bodies and give the doctors a sense of knowing exactly what to do to heal those limbs that have been so badly bruised and broken.
[time=1726] When we think of our young children, we think of Jennifer Chilcote, and we pray that you'll bring her fever down, Lord, and you'll help the doctors diagnose all of the problems that she has.
[time=1737] We pray for Brittany Paven.
[time=1739] We pray that as she has had operations to help correct her ability to walk, we pray that they'll be successful.
[time=1747] And you'll just give her a cheerful outlook as she smiles so much and just keep that outlook.
[time=1753] As Kyle as he struggles every day with his difficulties, thank you for his love for you and his good accountants each day, and see approaches five and gets older, and time goes that we pray that he'll have that same spirit.
[time=1770] We pray for Cecil Funk's family as he passed away this week.
[time=1775] We pray that you'll strengthen them, and there are others that have lost loved ones in the last few days.
[time=1780] We pray that you'll just help them in this time of need.
[time=1783] We're thankful for our men who are coming home from the Gulf.
[time=1786] We've prayed for them faithfully, and we thank you for interceding in our prayers and bringing some of these loved ones even to our immediate area.
[time=1793] We're thankful for that.
[time=1794] Thank you for taking care of that.
[time=1796] And we've got decisions to make in our church in the coming days as it relates to a senior pastor.
[time=1801] We pray that you will tell us clearly and direct us in a very definite way as to the way we should vote even next Sunday.
[time=1810] Now we thank you for all the good things that you gave us throughout this week, and the joys that we heard, and we're thankful for that.
[time=1817] And we're thankful that we can worship here together among our friends and loved ones.
[time=1821] We pray that everyone will feel at home, be at tune with you as we continue to worship in Jesus' name we pray.
[time=1827] [AMEN] We have the privilege today of having Dr. Paul House come and speak to us.
[time=1834] He'll be here in just a few minutes.
[time=1835] He's an professor and Old Testament at Taylor University.
[time=1839] We've had the opportunity to talk with him by phone, and I have several friends that mention that he's an outstanding speaker, and he proved that to be true in the first service this morning.
[time=1848] And we spent some time last week on stewardship of our finances this week.
[time=1852] We're talking about giving of our lives, commitment if you please.
[time=1855] I hope that you'll open your hearts as Dr. House comes to speak to us.
[time=1859] Would you welcome him to Blackhawk today?
[time=1861] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1868] Good morning. It's an honor to be here with you in the service today.
[time=1872] I appreciate this opportunity to share God's word with you.
[time=1876] I bring you greetings from Taylor University, from our faculty and staff, where we're attempting to train 1,700 plus students to be obedient to the truth of God in whatever field that they've chosen to study.
[time=1888] And we just really ask you to pray for us as we try to work with the young people
[time=1894] and continue to send us the kind of students you've sent us in the past.
[time=1898] We appreciate them and continue to encourage the parents who are paying those bills, because the faculty needs the money.
[time=1906] [laughter] I invite you to open your Bibles to the second book of the Old Testament, the book of Exodus, chapter 3. Exodus chapter 3, and verse 1, you ought always to have your Bible with you in church.
[time=1922] My dad gave me sound advice years ago. He said, always bring your Bible to church.
[time=1926] You can keep the preacher straight that way. And he said, if the sermon gets too bad, you can at least get your devotions in for the day. So I hope that you have your Bibles with you while you're turning there to Exodus chapter 3 and verse 1. It's good for us to remember what happens before this chapter. You'll remember that toward the end of the book of Genesis that all 12 sons of Jacob go down to Egypt to avoid a famine in the promised land. And that during the 400 years that elapsed between the book of Genesis and the book of Exodus, Israel grows numerous in Egypt. There are so many of them that Egypt's king fears there are political liability to his nation and attempts to kill all the boy babies. Chapter 2 of this tells us that one excellent, unusual child, Moses was spared by a miracle of God and he lived on.
[time=1986] And perhaps he would be the one to lead God's people.
[time=1990] Perhaps he would be the one to set them free. But chapter 2 also tells us that Moses kills an Egyptian and has to flee.
[time=1998] And he runs to the Sinai Peninsula north of Egypt. And there he buries himself in the desert.
[time=2006] He marries a woman who's not in Israelite.
[time=2010] She's the daughter of a pagan priest, one who doesn't worship God.
[time=2014] If we read Exodus 4 correctly, he doesn't even circumcise his sons when they are born.
[time=2022] In good old Baptist terms, Moses is backslidden.
[time=2026] He's not thought much about God's ways. He's not thought much about God's word. He's trying to hide from the Pharaoh and mind his own business. But God's hearing the cries of his people. If you want to understand the heart of God in the Old Testament, you would only need to look at Exodus 2, 23 to 25 because there the text tells us that God cared about his people.
[time=2050] He was hurting with them and for them. And so we come to Exodus 3-1. Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian.
[time=2062] And he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to horrib, the mountain of God. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it wasn't burning up. So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight why the bush doesn't burn up.
[time=2082] When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called him from within the bush, Moses, Moses.
[time=2090] He said, here I am. Do not come any closer, God said.
[time=2094] Take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground. Then he said, I'm the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
[time=2106] And at this, Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look at God.
[time=2110] The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.
[time=2114] I've heard their crying out because of their slave drivers.
[time=2118] I'm concerned about their suffering. So I've come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and a spacious land. A land flowing with milk and honey, the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, parasites, hivites and Jebusites. And now the cry of Israelites has reached me and I've seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. So now go, I'm sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.
[time=2150] But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?
[time=2158] God said, I will be with you and this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you. When you have brought the people out of Egypt you will worship on this mountain. Moses said to God, well suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, my fathers has sent me to you and they ask me, what's his name?
[time=2178] Then what shall I tell them? God said to Moses, I am who I am.
[time=2182] This is what you're to say to the Israelites. I am has sent me to you. God also said to Moses, say to the Israelites, the Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has sent me to you.
[time=2198] This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.
[time=2206] Perhaps it would be good for me to share with you why this passage has become important to me.
[time=2214] Why when I talked to your pastor and he said, you need to hear about Christian commitment, about committing your lives, not just your money but your very lives to God this week. Why was this passage that rose to the surface in my study and in my prayer?
[time=2230] Five years ago I was called to teach at Taylor University and I came from my first class 8 o'clock on a Wednesday morning and there on the front row with a new leather bound Bible was a heavy set young man with a serious look in his eye and with a strong set to his jaw that seemed to say to me, well let's see what you've got. Let's see if you can teach me anything.
[time=2254] We soon came to this passage and I gave a quiz as I do every day. Now you're probably wondering, why do you give a quiz every day? The answer is because I have read Genesis 3 the human race is a fallen bunch and probably if you don't have a quiz you won't read the assignment. At least that's what I remembered from my college days about being lazy and not reading my assignment so I give a quiz and I ask this question.
[time=2282] What was it about the bush that caused Moses to turn aside and get it? And John Coffey gave this answer that it was on fire and I counted it wrong of course because the answer was it was burning and not being burned up and he didn't like my decision and he went and talked to the fountain of wisdom. He talked to a sophomore and he said to the sophomore this question and the sophomore said you probably wrote down it was burning but the prof wanted it was not being consumed which kind of made John even matter but his time passed. We became pretty close and John came into my office and he said I don't like it but God's calling me to preach and he preached his first sermon in a church where I was in her impaster and I began to give him books and to encourage him there were other students that I was working with but perhaps the closest with him.
[time=2334] He slipped away from God his second year at school but it would come back to the Lord and was beginning to serve him again when my family and I left for the summer, the summer in Israel one will never forget.
[time=2346] We came home at the end of the summertime, a friend was picking us up at the airport and I was standing near the luggy-drack having been up nearly 24 hours being totally exhausted being absolutely jet-lagged standing near that luggy-drack praying those pious prayers we always pray something like this dear Lord please let the luggage be here. And that was the highest thing on my mind. The friend who picked us up was standing with my wife and our only child Molly and was filling them in on what had happened and Molly came over she was five years old and she said dad dad the cats have been killed and I never cared too much for the cats anyway though I have to admit that the ones who died were tremendous compared to the ones that we've got now so I wish that they had survived but really that didn't concern me too much and then she came over with a very serious look on her face and she said these words that still seem unreal to me she said John Coffey is dead and to this day that is hard for me to say the reaction that I had was this some of the people I had really worked with had graduated and this young man who I'd worked so hard with was gone was with the Lord and I said really what's the use you really shouldn't get too close to people because those who don't get older and go on simply die sometime later that year I was reading Exodus 3 and I was smiling at the discussions I used to have with John and the little jokes we used to play about Exodus 3 and God asked me a serious question I want to ask you today. God said to me is the bush still burning for you? Are you still ready to meet me in daily circumstances? Are you still hearing my call for your life? Are you still willing to share the name of the great I am? In other words are you ready to pour your life into people again? Would you understand that death does not cancel the call of God that graduation or troubles or trials do not cancel the call of God? I want to ask you today in your own life and your own Christian commitment is the bush still burning look with me at the text first of all in verses 1 to 6 and I want us to ask ourselves this question are we still meeting God in daily circumstances?
[time=2510] Moses was doing his job when God came to him he was tending the flock as I said he wasn't exactly a spiritual giant at this time and he certainly did not expect God to move in his life but all of a sudden God moved into that situation spoke to Moses through this bush that he saw burning and not being consumed and Moses said I'm going to turn aside and look at this great thing when he got there God said take your shoes off this is holy ground this is a place of worship I want to remind you where it was that he met with God it was right there on the job and God said that's holy ground now some of you think I'm crazy but where you work is holy ground you may be thinking if you can only hear the kind of language that's used on my job if you can only hear the crazy things people do if you only knew the affairs and all the other stuff that's going on and I can only say I hope you're not working at Taylor or at this church if you're saying those things but you think of all these things that are going on around me and you call this holy ground let me simply ask you one question did God call you to that job did God provide that work for you if he did this is holy ground he's called you there to be a burning bush to other people in the workplace some of you are students of all agents you say boy if you only knew what the kids at school were like you wouldn't tell me it was holy ground I want you to understand that God has called you to have a unique and special witness for Jesus Christ in that place some of your homemakers I've tried that in short term kinds of ways and I've just decided I don't intend to work that hard ever and some of you were saying boy if you only knew how my family was you wouldn't call the home and homemaking holy ground my mother worked for 31 years before she passed away to teach my dad that a doorknob or the back of a door is not the place to hang your trousers and until we got married she tried to teach some of us not to throw the stuff where it doesn't belong and she tried to teach us to have a good attitude about taking out the garbage and she tried to feel appreciated as she raised six children and you'd say boy if you just knew what I went through if you know how much nagging and pleading I had to do you wouldn't call this place holy ground I want to say to you it may be the holiest of all as you impact lives for Jesus Christ are you meeting God where you live and work how was it that Moses met with God he turned aside to see this great miracle and he said well how could he help it something unusual was going on have you never read Johnny Levin how when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead some people went and complained to the authorities how can these things be have you ever read the story of the rich man in Lazarus how Lazarus was in hell and he said to Father Abraham send somebody back from the dead then my brothers will believe and he said that's not the case if they won't believe Moses and the prophets they wouldn't believe if somebody came back from the dead let me bring it on home some of us men have been given good wives and children yet we don't turn aside to listen to God some women have been given good husbands good children men and women given good careers young people given good homes that doesn't necessarily mean we're grateful enough to turn aside and listen to God unfortunately some of us have gotten away from the Lord he sent trouble to us just to see if we'll turn aside and look I want to say this to you God will meet with you God wants to make your workplace holy ground why because he wants us to worship him there you live a very impoverished Christian life if you only worship the Lord here God wants to meet with you is the bush still burning for a daily relationship with Jesus Christ second question I'd like for us to look at in verses 7 to 12 are you still hearing the call of God is the bush still burning to listen to God's will for your life don't worry there are some principles as you seek and pray that God gives us in this text that will help us to understand his will the first of these verses 7 to 9 and that is that God bases his call on human need verses 7 to 9 God said indeed I have seen the misery of my people in Egypt I've heard them crying out because of their slave drivers I am concerned about their suffering God cares about the hurts of people and if you're wondering what God is calling you to do consider this do you hear the cries of those who are hurting for salvation?
[time=2850] Romans 3 10 is right there's done righteous no not one Romans 3 23 is correct all of sin come short of the glory of God from little children to age and adults we are sinners I told you I only have one child and we love her to pieces we have a great time with her we think she is the best and brightest that God has ever put on the earth but she's a sinner let me illustrate when she was but four or five years old I got one of those calls from my wife now she denies it but she began saying your daughter your daughter your daughter and she said I've spanked her I've asked the neighbors to spank her I want you to spank her and I said well what is it what is it that she's done and she said she and her little friend Eric have taken magic markers and written all over my good couch pillows so I saw the seriousness of the situation went home saw the couch pillows Molly's name was written on one and there were stars and other things all over it I actually thought it was kind of funny so I put on my parental game face and went in there and said to the child what's this thing you've done and she said I didn't do it and so I said you know those great comebacks because we're experienced parents I said well then who did it and she said Eric did it all well now I didn't need a phony game face I had my reel went on I said oh Eric wrote your name on the pillows did he and I noticed some of your other art working with this irrefutable evidence she finally broke down under cross-examination and admitted under great duress that she had indeed done it but Eric went one farther his mother said what is this thing you have done he said we didn't do it and she said well then how did this happen she said those magic markers really were magic they did it all by themselves
[time=2992] and Deborah said what went through her mind as she listened to her son
[time=2998] I like this creatively but I like this the human heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it these little sinners could look us right in the eye and lie and we can smile about that because he said well maybe we could fix those kinds of sins but think of the evil in the human heart and the human race it can produce a Hitler who sends six million people to their death or the evil of a Stalin and the evil of a communist system that would send ten times that many to death in work camps and other places or Saddam Hussein that we've just spent so much effort and time and prayers and blood to defeat let me tell you neighbors they fall somewhere on the spectrum between my daughter and the monsters I've mentioned but they need Jesus Christ people do need the Lord is the bush still burning for you to care about their lostness about their salvation what about their reclamation I don't suppose every member of this church is here today now some of them are sick and some of them are out of town and some of them have a job to do but a lot of them just don't care or a lot of them are like my friend Bill that I met Kentucky was a member of my church Bill got mad over some building plans at his church it's usually a deep theological issue isn't it that divide us and he left the church he stayed away 15 years during that time Bill saw the opportunity to buy a liquor store and he bought it and his business was good and a couple years before I came to the church Bill he retired and he lived in a real nice house that some of our church people were quick to say that's built with liquor money built with liquor money but thank the Lord a couple of young women who came out to our Thursday night visitation they hadn't heard all those stories they just went down to this house and flat out that's Bill indeed a come to church Dee couldn't come because she had to take care of her mother but Bill came to church and after some time he finally told me after he had shown that he was back with the Lord he said you know who got hurt over those 15 years wasn't the people I was mad at it was me I lost all those years and wasted a witness for Jesus Christ but he said I want to be back home now and God used him in the years he had left before he went to be with Jesus there are a lot of people I fear who are waiting for someone like those two women to come and say we love you would you come back to church we love people at Blackhawk Baptist Church is your heart still burning for those kinds of folks is your heart burning for those who are poor and homeless needy for those who don't have what we have is the bush still burning to hear the call of God are you willing in your life to say whatever the call of God is in my life even if that means teaching a Sunday school even if that means keeping the nursery even if that means whatever it is you don't want to do are you willing to answer the call of God I want to encourage you that not only does God base it on human need God bases it on his power Moses was exactly right in verses 11 and 12 he said who am I to go I can't go God said you're right I'll go through you of course you can't teach that class of course you can't preach the gospel of course you can't witness effectively but God can through you God promises all his people I will never leave you nor forsake you lo I am with you always even until the end of the age are you hearing the call of God one last thing this morning verses 13 to 15 Moses got over saying who am I he then says to God who are you and God says I am who I am and he explained it I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob in other words I am an eternal God no matter what the depth of the problem is and Israel had been in Egypt four hundred years no matter how deep seated the problem is an eternal God can fix it I'm the one who wants to bring them up out of slavery it doesn't matter what kind of bondage you're in it doesn't matter if it's alcohol or drugs or sex or something else God can break the bondage and he said I have heard the cries of my people maybe you were taught years ago that God's mean and harsh and vicious and just looking for a chance to get you understand that I am the God who hurt with Abraham when his wife couldn't have a baby I am the God who hurt with Isaac when the neighbors were cruel to him I am the God who went with Jacob down there and helped him deal with that crazy father-in-law of his laban I'm the God who cares for people I am and I want to ask you today is the bush still burning in your life to share the name of God the name that is above every other name the name that Revelation chapter 19 says is king of kings and lord of lords and Isaiah 9 says it's a wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father in the prince of peace do you still believe that sharing the name of Jesus makes all the difference there is to make is a bush still burning for you for evangelism for discipleship for ministry for relationship with God is a bush still burning I want to make this personal to you today I'd never been the black hawk Baptist church before this morning but I always heard good things about it I'd heard good things about your school and what the church was doing but at the risk of offending you I want to ask you this are you going to rest on your laurels are you going to sit back and say we're good enough or will you hear Isaiah's call to let God do a new thing is the bush still burning for ministry in this town and in this region I hope and pray it is let me ask you as an individual Christian who says I trust Jesus as my lord and savior is the bush still burning for you for service for ministry you say you don't know how I've been hurt I have an idea because I've been hurt too the choir had it exactly right God is faithful he will pick you up and help you do what needs to be done if you're here and you're not a Christian wouldn't you like to have as a fire burning in your life the king of kings the lord of lords the god who says I am wouldn't you like to have Jesus in your life who says I am the way the truth in life no one comes to the father but by me wouldn't you like to have that power in your life and make it the driving force and all that you do
[time=3452] some of you here are feeling the call to ministry you're not adequate to preach the word of god neither is anyone else you're feeling the call to be a missionary you don't know how to be done I don't know either but I know this if the fire burns god will keep it alive this morning wouldn't you make sure that the fires of your Christian commitment are burning brightly please pray for me our lord and our god we are not adequate to preach the searchable riches of your word nor jesus christ so we ask that right now the holy spirit would convict people who need to trust Jesus of sin a judgment of righteousness that you would bring Christians back to yourself that you would call out some to preach the gospel father do these things according to your will in Jesus name amen
