[time=902] â™ª
[time=908] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour. We're glad you tuned in today. I want to introduce to you our special guests that we have today. Russell Moore is with us. He was here just a couple of weeks ago. Good morning Russ. Nice to have you here again.
[time=920] Good morning Peter. Thank you. We're glad to be here.
[time=922] We're going to talk a little bit more about your involvement in today's service and even this evening's in a little bit. Russ this is the time of the year that as I think of the events of Easter, Palm Sunday, Good Friday, there must have been tremendous emotions from the great pomp and circumstance of Jesus coming into the city writing triumphantly and then just a few short days later the death of Christ and then the resurrection. Doesn't it just kind of even now get us up and down in our emotions?
[time=951] Well you can almost feel the city that was over, populated and it swelled to a huge size. Probably two and a half million people came to the city of Jerusalem and it says in the text we're studying this morning that by the time the triumphal entry had completed the city was stirred was as if an earthquake had occurred and people were shaken by the reality that Jesus had come. I still feel that even today I guess in a way.
[time=973] It's exciting. We are in the as we take this this is Palm Sunday and then we'll be going through the Easter season as you're watching this this is Easter Sunday morning and that's a glorious time for Christians as we celebrate the glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=988] I hope you know him as personal say here and you're involved too in this great celebration. If you're with us in the Fort Wayne area you can still have the opportunity to come to our celebration service this evening at six o'clock at the Blackhawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1004] We're having an evening called Easter in drama and song tonight at the church at 6 p.m. If you don't have a regular place to attend church come and join with us. It'll be about an hour long service and it will be inspiring to you I'm sure.
[time=1018] Well Russell we talked about we welcomed you here again and we you have your entire family here. This is official day for you to candidate as senior pastor of Blackhawk Baptist Church and we're just delighted to have you here. Tell us a little bit about your family why don't you do that.
[time=1035] Well we're so excited we got to come out from California on a plane and that's the first time for my three of my four daughters to fly. We left our infinite home but Randy, Nikki and Kelly are along for the ride and I think as that plane began to take off from LAX their eyes got as big as saucers and we're just having a great time.
[time=1053] My daughters are in the fourth the first and then in kindergarten and so we're covering that elementary group pretty well and we're having a lot of fun out here in Blackhawk.
[time=1063] Well this has been quite a procedure Russ we went out to California a few weeks ago and got to meet your family and saw you in action in your church and at the college at Masters College and we've had a number of tapes that we've listened to.
[time=1079] How have you become acquainted with Blackhawk? Well you were gracious enough to send us some tapes of the Bible hour and so our family gathered around there in California and had fun watching the ministries of your church and then others have come into our lives.
[time=1093] Even as of late I was having lunch with Dr. Howard Hendrix this week from Dallas Theological Seminary and he of course speaks very highly of Blackhawk Baptist Church David Jeremiah being one of his students and he's been following the church.
[time=1107] He's come here I guess many different times the reputation of Blackhawk is very strong and we've been hearing about it from many different avenues.
[time=1113] We're really excited to have you back today and we trust the Lord will really lead in this entire day as we listen to you preach and then pray a little bit more and then actually make the final decision as it relates to the congregation to invite you and I certainly hope that all is in the Lord's timing as you're here.
[time=1132] I was excited to have you and Heidi come back but I was particularly excited about the kids coming we're glad to have the family with us today.
[time=1141] This is a great day for us and we are excited as we listen to Russell Moore speak in this morning's service you'll hear him in a little bit and he'll be with us in our evening service here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1151] Just before we go back to the live portion of our program I'd like to take a moment and remind you of our gift offer for this month.
[time=1159] Just a number of weeks ago we had Dr. John MacArthur here at Blackhawk Baptist Church and he's a fine radio speaker, a great author and just gave an inspiring message that night that we thought that would be valuable for you to hear and we put it on video cassette.
[time=1174] We'd like to have you receive a copy of that cassette if you'll write us today.
[time=1178] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1188] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1196] As you write if you can please enclose a gift of $15 to help defray the cost of providing that tape.
[time=1203] While we've had a very good morning already and we're looking forward to the rest of the service with some more music and then the message from Russell Moore stay tuned with us won't you as we continue with the Bible Hour.
[time=1233] Because you pay so high a place.
[time=1247] You pay much to help a place for me, your tears, your blood, the pain.
[time=1263] Don't be afraid to, you deserve my place.
[time=1274] You deserve a Bible Hour, I want to try your sacrifice because you pay so high a place.
[time=1304] Your grace inspires my heart to rise above the sun and all the earthly fantasies that seek to draw me in.
[time=1331] I want to tell you this jaded world of love that truly saved my life.
[time=1344] You pay so high a place.
[time=1356] You pay much to help a place for me, your tears, your blood, your pain.
[time=1372] To have my soul to stay that time and yet never truly change.
[time=1386] You deserve a place that long before the door is that we've heard.
[time=1400] Because you pay much to help a place.
[time=1414] There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from the moon as waves.
[time=1437] And the sea has launched beneath the night for a place that's now there again to stay.
[time=1461] You deserve a place that won't help a place because you pay much to help a place.
[time=1491] You are born in prayer with me.
[time=1512] Father, help us not to forget the price that you paid on Calvary for our salvation, for our eternal life.
[time=1518] We are indeed grateful.
[time=1522] And Lord, sometimes we just don't show it.
[time=1525] Today as we come before you, we want to renew that vow that we love you.
[time=1529] We are thankful that we can come together with brethren who love you and want to serve and worship you in a sanctuary such as this today.
[time=1538] Thank you for the music that has proclaimed the name of Jesus today and reminded us of the price that you paid for our salvation.
[time=1547] There are many people that need our prayers today.
[time=1550] We pray for Keith Nichols who is struggling with the heart problem.
[time=1554] And you'll just get it right and help the doctors to know exactly what to do.
[time=1560] We pray for Greg as he goes through some of the most trying circumstances now in the next few days of his life.
[time=1566] And we pray that all will go according to your will and to your plan.
[time=1571] And Lord, there are other people who have lost jobs in recent days and are struggling right now with that and wondering what to do and not knowing the future.
[time=1579] And you don't always tell us that.
[time=1581] You ask us to trust you and we pray that they'll do that.
[time=1584] And those that are looking forward to days of darkness because of terminal illness.
[time=1590] We pray that you'll just help and strengthen them and each day that becomes a real bad day.
[time=1596] You'll be there to lift them up and pick them out of the mighty clay.
[time=1600] Set their feet back on the rock and continue to hold them up.
[time=1604] Bless our church service today.
[time=1606] We thank you for it again.
[time=1607] And bless us as he speaks that your Holy Spirit might be with him.
[time=1610] Give him a freedom to proclaim God's word freely.
[time=1614] In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[time=1617] It's hard not to get overwhelmed when you listen to that music.
[time=1623] And you know of the people that have gotten saved in recent days here and their lives have been changed and they're on the same path going to eternity that we are.
[time=1632] Praise the Lord for that.
[time=1633] Well, this has been a day that we've waited for for a number of months and we're delighted to have Russ and Heidi more back with us.
[time=1640] Russ, as I mentioned, is a candidate for Senior Pastor today and I want him to come in just a few minutes.
[time=1646] It's a delight to have him back and to have the fellowship that we've had these last two or three days.
[time=1651] You continue to be praying that God's will will be done in everything that we do today.
[time=1655] As Russ comes to the platform, I want you to also greet the better-looking part of the family.
[time=1661] Three of their four children are here.
[time=1663] However, two of them are in the children's church, but Brandy and Mom Heidi are in the second row here.
[time=1670] Would you stand and let's greet them and greet Russ as he comes to the pulpit today.
[time=1682] Thank you.
[time=1684] Thank you very much. That's very kind.
[time=1697] We're very excited to be back with you.
[time=1699] We're thrilled at the opportunity to come not only to preach the Word of God, but to consider what this weekend might mean for all of us for a good long time.
[time=1707] And so our thanks to the search committee and the elders and the staff who have all, I guess, had a part in bringing us back.
[time=1714] But this morning, let's give our attention to the task at hand and that is to look at the Word of God.
[time=1719] So if you have your Bibles with you this morning, let's open them to Matthew 21.
[time=1724] And we'll study this morning the triumphal entry or Palm Sunday.
[time=1729] Matthew chapter 21, I'll read verses 1 through 11 and you follow along.
[time=1734] And when they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Beth Fage to the Mount of Olives,
[time=1740] then Jesus sent two disciples saying to them, "Go into the village opposite you." And immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her, untie them and bring them to me.
[time=1754] And if anyone says something to you, "You shall say the Lord has need of them, and immediately he will send them."
[time=1762] Now this took place that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, "Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your king is coming to you gentle and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the full of a beast of burden."
[time=1776] And the disciples went and did just as Jesus had directed them and brought the donkey and the colt and laid on them their garments on which he sat.
[time=1784] And most of the multitudes spread their garments in the road and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road.
[time=1791] And the multitudes going before him and those who followed after were crying out saying, "Hosanna to the son of David.
[time=1798] Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest." And when he had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred saying, "Who is this?" And the multitudes were saying, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee."
[time=1816] With this marvelous account, we come to the last week in the life of our Lord.
[time=1822] He comes to Jerusalem for his last time never to leave again.
[time=1827] His earthly life of some 33 years, the first 30 in relative obscurity, the next three and a half in public ministry are drawing to a close.
[time=1837] And this would be a week like no other week.
[time=1840] The hatred of his own people would reach a climax, a crown would be forced upon his head and nails would pierce his flesh.
[time=1848] This would be the week that he would bear the sins of the world and the loneliness of being separated from his father.
[time=1857] All of this begins with the triumphal entry.
[time=1861] And the question I'd like to pose to you this morning is what is the significance of the triumphal entry?
[time=1867] We know well the other red-letter days in our Lord's life. Christmas, God is with us, Emmanuel.
[time=1873] Good Friday, the crucifixion of Christ. Jesus dies for our sins. Easter is resurrection morning.
[time=1880] But what are we to do with Palm Sunday?
[time=1882] What part does it play in the scope of redemptive history?
[time=1886] From our Sunday school lessons, we would remember it as a time of great excitement and joy.
[time=1892] Jesus is coming to Jerusalem. We can almost see the pictures of old as he rides to Jerusalem on the colts
[time=1898] and the palm branches are being laid in front of him and people are taking their garments off and making a royal carpet as it were, and they're all yelling "Ozzanna" to the Son of David.
[time=1908] And from this very basic understanding, we're left with some impressions.
[time=1913] One, at last, the long overdue honor and recognition that had been due the King of kings and Lord of Lords
[time=1921] was finally, if only in a brief way, given to him.
[time=1926] Another impression we might take away from that understanding is finally there was a moment of rest in his life.
[time=1934] Finally there was a point of personal joy as he approaches Jerusalem, the holy city, and the disciples were with him.
[time=1940] Mary and Martha and Lazarus were there as well, and they're moving along with the multitudes.
[time=1945] It might have been just a great sigh of relief, you know. Finally I can just relax in this thing.
[time=1951] Then another impression comes, somehow all that excitement turned against him.
[time=1957] We read with astonishment, the amazing shift in popular opinion, how at the beginning of the week they were screaming "Ozzanna"
[time=1963] and by the end of the week all with one accord crucified him.
[time=1968] Overpowered it seems by the forces of evil the Lamb of God was slaughtered.
[time=1974] But you know none of those impressions are accurate?
[time=1977] None of those really do justice to the biblical narrative.
[time=1981] First of all, it wasn't a time in which he was honored or recognized.
[time=1986] They were screaming "Ozzanna" which means save now.
[time=1989] Save now Jesus and what they wanted was a political king, a military messiah to overthrow the oppression of Rome and to bring to them all the blessings of the Millennial Kingdom.
[time=1999] They may as well have been screaming in the vernacular of our day, lottery!
[time=2003] Let us win the lottery and with it we'll take the money and we'll fix all of our earthly plates and we'll have a multitude of blessings.
[time=2011] They were screaming for a material kingdom, a physical kingdom, an earthly kingdom.
[time=2016] But from day one Jesus had come saying this, "Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand."
[time=2022] His was first a spiritual kingdom entered in by repentance seeking after true righteousness confession of sin.
[time=2030] They were crying out for deliverance from bondage to Rome and Jesus came proclaiming deliverance from bondage to sin.
[time=2039] There was no true honoring or recognition of the person of Jesus or his message in the triumphal entry.
[time=2045] Only the escalating frenzied hysterical demands for political and material prosperity.
[time=2055] Nor was it a bright spot for Jesus personally despite the proximity of his disciples, Mary, Martha and Lazarus, the multitude.
[time=2063] John 12 tells us that his disciples didn't even understand the significance of the triumphal entry until after he'd been glorified.
[time=2069] And the Holy Spirit came and then finally they could see just a glimpse of what was really going on.
[time=2074] They were in the dark and he was alone.
[time=2078] As we'll see as this our time progresses I believe that the triumphal entry apart from his experience in the garden of Gethsemane
[time=2086] and then on the cross this the triumphal entry may be one of his most traumatic and loneliest events.
[time=2094] One of the most lonely and traumatic events in the life of Jesus.
[time=2098] Furthermore Jesus was not overpowered by the forces of evil, he was in fact provoking the forces of evil deliberately, consciously.
[time=2108] So as to set off a chain reaction of events beginning with the triumphal entry and continuing through the events of that week until
[time=2116] eventuating in his own crucifixion because Jesus had come not to make war with Rome but to make peace with God.
[time=2126] And the only way he could do that was to die.
[time=2130] Sort of the question what is the significance of the triumphal entry, I would answer this.
[time=2139] Jesus orchestrates the triumphal entry as a demonstration allowing the masses to provoke the Pharisees in such a way that by Friday both the
[time=2149] multitudes and their leadership would be calling forth in one accord for his life, which he would then willingly give.
[time=2161] We should never confuse the truth as Hebrews 726 says that Jesus was innocent, the innocent lamb of God, with the erroneous notion that Jesus was a victim in his death.
[time=2172] There is a world of difference between saying that Jesus was innocent and Jesus was a victim, no one took his life, no one overpowered him, he freely gave his life.
[time=2181] Matthew 20, the passage directly in front of the one we're studying this morning, Jesus says this, "I did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give my life a ransom for many."
[time=2192] Jesus came to die, John 10 he says the same thing, "No one has taken my life away from me, but I lay it down of my own initiative."
[time=2202] Matthew 27 we find Jesus on the cross, it says he cried out again with a loud voice and what?
[time=2209] He yielded up his spirit.
[time=2212] Jesus was not directly killed by anyone, nor did he die by the natural processes of the cross.
[time=2221] Jesus freely gave up his own life, he released his own spirit.
[time=2225] Jesus had come to die, but he would die in a prescribed way, in a prescribed place and of significance this morning at a prescribed time.
[time=2236] From his birth he was a wanted man, Herod slaughtered thousands trying to kill him, all the way through his public ministry, the Pharisees continued to escalate their efforts in conspiring to kill him such that he was constantly forced to withdraw.
[time=2250] You can do a study of the life of Jesus in the book of John by following the word he withdrew, he withdrew.
[time=2256] Begins after his first cleansing of the temple the religious leaders were so agitated that he withdrew to the country districts.
[time=2263] When jealousy developed over his relationship to John the Baptist he again withdrew to Galilee.
[time=2269] When his hometown rejected him he withdrew to a friendlier city.
[time=2274] When his second visit at Jerusalem met with rejection he once again withdrew to Galilee.
[time=2280] When at the beginning of his third year his adopted city, the city of Capernaum repudiated him he withdrew again only this time to the Gentile regions of Palestine.
[time=2290] Over and over again the hostilities would escalate and Jesus would withdraw.
[time=2295] Why? Because his time had not yet come.
[time=2299] Early in his public ministry to his mother's remark Jesus they've run out of wine, they're at the wedding, Jesus responds, "Woman what have I to do with you?
[time=2309] My time has not yet come." In John 7 to his brother's sarcasm and disbelief as they urged him prematurely into the public eye he said, "My time is not yet at hand."
[time=2323] In John 8 as he preached with authority in the temple it says of him, "No one seized him because his hour had not yet come."
[time=2334] But finally in John 12 with the triumphal entry Jesus says, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
[time=2344] Now my soul is troubled and what shall I say, "Father save me from this hour, but for this purpose I came to this hour."
[time=2360] And finally John 19 all the time had run out and Jesus said what? It is finished. It is finished.
[time=2370] What I came to do I have now done and it is finished and then it says he gave up his spirit.
[time=2376] You see the ingredients for the crucifixion had been there all the while through his entire life.
[time=2381] One the grasping hysteria of the masses for political and material prosperity and two the insane seething jealousy and hatred of the Jewish leaders
[time=2392] wanting to take his life and remove him from the scene.
[time=2395] Through the triumphal entry Jesus allows those two forces of evil to collide and then explode because now his time had come.
[time=2409] Let's look at our text this morning first the place. The place of the triumphal entry verse one.
[time=2414] And when they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Beth Phage to the Mount of Olives then Jesus sent two disciples.
[time=2423] The place was Jerusalem and every city I guess has its own flavor and its own feeling.
[time=2429] San Francisco the city by the bay, New York the big apple, Hong Kong the jewel of the Orient and Fort Wayne known worldwide
[time=2438] as the home of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2442] But to Jesus Jerusalem was just another name for crucifixion.
[time=2450] To Jesus Jerusalem was just another name.
[time=2454] Just another title for crucifixion go back to Matthew chapter 16.
[time=2458] Will you? Verse 21. From that time Matthew 16 21 Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things
[time=2469] from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and raised up on the third day.
[time=2475] Now flip over to Matthew 20.
[time=2478] Matthew 20 verses 17 through 19.
[time=2481] And as Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and on the way he said to them
[time=2489] "Behold we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes
[time=2496] and they will condemn him to death and will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify him
[time=2502] on the third day he will be raised up." The passage we're looking at this morning and when they had approached Jerusalem.
[time=2512] So everybody else Jerusalem was the city of worship and at this time of year during the Passover it was a place to go
[time=2518] and make sacrifices for your sins.
[time=2521] To Jesus it was the place to be sacrificed for sins.
[time=2529] To Jesus Jerusalem was the place of death. Everybody else came to sacrifice their Passover lamb.
[time=2536] Jesus knew he was the Passover lamb.
[time=2541] Would you turn with me to Luke chapter 19 we'll see Luke's addition to the triumphal entry.
[time=2547] It's an amazing reality.
[time=2550] They're coming down verse 37.
[time=2552] The descent of the Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice
[time=2558] for all the miracles which they had seen saying blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=2564] Now look at verse 41 and when he approached he saw the city and he wept over it.
[time=2571] That's why I say this may be his most lonely and desperate moment outside of Gethsemane and the cross.
[time=2576] Picture the scenario there's thousands of people around him.
[time=2579] They're making a royal carpet for him his best friends in the whole world.
[time=2583] The disciples Mary Lazarus and Martha are there but as soon as he comes over the last little gnoll
[time=2589] and there he sees the city of Jerusalem in the midst of all the public assembly he just breaks down and he weeps.
[time=2597] He laments because he knows what that city is all about.
[time=2602] He knows that instead of that city look at verse 42 recognizing who he is.
[time=2608] If you had known in this day even you the things which make for peace he said I come for peace.
[time=2614] But now they have been hidden from your eyes and then he curses the city.
[time=2619] For the day shall come upon you when your enemies will throw up a bank before you and surround you and him you in on every side and will level you to the ground and your children within you they will not leave you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.
[time=2639] Finally he sees the city and he just weeps.
[time=2642] Jerusalem for Jesus meant crucifixion.
[time=2646] He wept that they couldn't understand the significance of this prophetic day.
[time=2650] He wept that they would have to be cursed and he wept that he would soon die.
[time=2655] Go to Matthew chapter 23 and you'll find they're a very familiar set of verses O Jerusalem.
[time=2662] Jerusalem do you remember our Lord lamenting Matthew 23 verse 37 O Jerusalem Jerusalem
[time=2669] and listen to how he describes the city who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her.
[time=2676] You've killed all the prophets my father has sent to you to date and you'll kill this prophet too.
[time=2683] How often I have wanted to gather your children together the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings
[time=2689] and you were unwilling behold your house is being left to you desolate for I say to you
[time=2695] from now on you shall not see me until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[time=2704] To Jesus Jerusalem was the place of death. Let's look secondly at the presentation of our king.
[time=2714] Back to Matthew 21 verses 2 through 7 it's an amazing thing.
[time=2721] Verse 5 say to the daughter of Zion behold your king is coming to you gentle and mounted on a donkey
[time=2728] even on a cold the fall of a beast of burden. This is Zachariah 9 9 Matthew is writing to a Jewish audience
[time=2737] and he's trying his best to convert this Jewish readership to the person of Jesus Christ to say that this Jesus who walked among you and whom you heard about he is the true and the living Messiah.
[time=2747] This is one of 93 different Old Testament quotes that Matthew marshals in his book to try to help his readers
[time=2755] understand that Jesus was the Messiah. Zachariah 9 we can't go there for lack of time but in that passage
[time=2763] verses 1 through 8 it's describing a great ruler who comes to protect and save and to deliver Israel
[time=2770] from the oppression of our enemies the Syrians and those of Felistia.
[time=2774] It was ultimately fulfilled that prophecy by none other than Alexander the Great and we can almost see in our
[time=2780] minds eye the glory of his military conquest he comes riding on this great white stallion his sword was flashing in the sun
[time=2789] and entourage of military might accompanies him with his generals and his men and his weapons of war
[time=2795] and in contrast to that great conqueror there is your true king the king of Israel who comes gentle
[time=2802] and mounted on a donkey humble and mounted on a donkey not on a spirited war horse or prancing stallion but
[time=2813] on a stupid beast of burden none other than a donkey's cult gentleness the Lord called himself gentle
[time=2823] in Matthew chapter 11 as he looked out over the masses and he saw that they've been stooped into a false religious system
[time=2829] by the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they were all over burdened with trying to keep the law as if they could earn their way to heaven
[time=2836] Jesus says come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[time=2845] and learn from me for I am gentle and humble of heart and in coming to me you shall find rest for your souls
[time=2858] he was a gentle king he was an altogether different sort of king not a foreign tyrant but Israel's own king not a cruel and oppressive king
[time=2867] but a righteous king bringing salvation not slaying but saving not rich but poor not proud but humble and gentle
[time=2877] the place Jerusalem the presentation humility and now third the pageantry the pageantry of this great moment
[time=2889] verses 8 through 9 look at verse 8 and most of the multitude spread their garments in the road and others were cutting branches
[time=2897] from the trees and spreading them in the road you say why were they taking off their garments and making this royal carpet
[time=2905] the probability is that they were following the following the examples of the disciples in verse 7 when the beasts of burden came they took their garments off and laid them there
[time=2914] but it's also I think a throwback the second king's nine when Jehu had his coronation as king it says there each man took his garment
[time=2923] and placed it under him on the steps the bare steps and blew the trumpet saying Jehu is king
[time=2930] that's as if to say I am under your feet and laying my garments there I place myself in a position of submission under you
[time=2939] the poem branches in scripture are noted as signifying times of great joy
[time=2946] and as this great crowd comes with Jesus from Bethany the crowd in verse 8 is coming with him from Bethany he'd been in Jericho
[time=2954] and he's making his way south and he comes to Bethany before the pastor excuse me before the Sabbath and it's there that we believe he kept the Sabbath
[time=2962] and then there was that beautiful meal he had with Lazarus and Mary broke the bottle of perfume and anointed his feet and rubbed it with her hair
[time=2969] and with him there had come a great throng of people because they were all trying to get to the same place Jerusalem for the same event the Passover and so there's literally thousands of people coming with him
[time=2980] but there's a second crowd that comes along look at verse 9 and the multitudes going before him and those who followed after him
[time=2989] there's actually two groups of people to see the second group turn with me to John chapter 12 for a minute
[time=2995] John chapter 12 the city of Jerusalem had bulged for the Passover they took a census about ten years after this particular Passover
[time=3005] and through that census they determined that some 260,000 lambs had been slain
[time=3011] now Jewish law allowed for one lamb to be slain for every ten people
[time=3017] giving us a rough estimate of some 2.6 million people in Jerusalem for the Passover
[time=3023] bulging at the seams look at verse 12 on the next day the great multitude who had come to the feast when they heard Jesus was coming to Jerusalem
[time=3033] see they were already in Jerusalem they took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him and began to cry out Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord even the king of Israel so what you have in this triumphal entry is a huge group of people thousands of people coming with Jesus
[time=3050] from Bethany up to the top of the Mount of Olives and then descending the western slope into Jerusalem and coming out from the city another massive group of people because they'd heard that this is the Jesus who had raised
[time=3061] Lazarus from the dead and not only was Jesus in the group but Lazarus was there too and they wanted to see him both it's the greatest side show on earth they wanted to come check it out and so as these two huge throngs of people meet the excitement mounts and they cry out Hosanna to the son of David the son of David is a prophetic messianic title from 2 Samuel 7 where God promises to David that though he should not be the one to build the temple but through his line there will come a son and his son will rule forever and ever and ever and they knew that phrase and that's what they were proclaiming son of David Jesus you are the one that was promised to King David and to us you are our Messiah and as they descend down that western slope of the Mount of Olives and drawing near to Jerusalem
[time=3112] it finally comes inside and amidst this huge throng Jesus breaks down and weeps
[time=3120] the product the product Matthew chapter 21 verses 10 through 11
[time=3128] what was he doing what was he trying to produce in all of this
[time=3135] verse 10 and when he had entered Jerusalem all the city was stirred saying who is this and the multitudes were saying this is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee in other words there was this great group coming with them another great group went out to meet him and when that huge group of people finally got back into the city everybody who remained was asking one simple question who is this guy what's all this commotion about would you notice the words stirred in verse 10 the words stirred now you'll have to take this by faith because I don't think many of you are native Californians
[time=3171] I've gone through a few earthquakes and the consequence of an earthquake there are really two shakings in every earthquake the first one is when the earth shakes and when that stops shaking you're still shaking with fear you're terrified you're trembling your hands are moving and if you've ever been in one you know what I mean and that is the Greek derivative of this word it means earthquake it means to be shaken by an earthquake
[time=3193] and so powerful was this demonstration that when Jesus finally hit the city as it was if the whole thing had been shaken to its roots by an earthquake and everybody was left with the trauma of what happens next it impacted all potentially 2.6 million of them
[time=3211] and they were crying out this is the prophet of Jesus from Nazareth
[time=3217] there was a group of guys that were extremely bothered by all of this
[time=3223] let me show them to you go to Luke chapter 19 before they actually reached the city as this huge entourage continues to build and the excitement continues to mount and as you'll notice in Luke 19 verse 37 the crowd wasn't just yelling blessed is the king they were saying with a loud voice all the miracles which they had seen they had seen Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead and many of them had been the direct benefits of his miracles and they're saying look I can see now and I never could before and I'm walking I've never done that before would you care to touch me I used to have leprosy but not anymore the son of David Hosanna to the king and all this excitement is building and look at verse 39 some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him teacher rebuke your disciples stop them this can't go on they were beside themselves with jealousy it was as if they had their hands over their ears and they said we can't take it any longer make them stop driving us nuts turn back to John chapter 12 those were the Pharisees who had to suffer through the entourage coming to the city and when they finally got to the city verse 18 John 12 18 for this cause also the multitude went and met him because they had heard that he had performed this sign namely raising Lazarus from the dead, now look at verse 19 the Pharisees therefore said to one another you see that you are not doing any good look the world has gone after him in other words this is not working out as we plan this is horrible nothing we could imagine could be any worse than this the whole stinking world has gone after this Jesus of Nazareth who they're calling a prophet interesting title for Jesus prophet he was generally known by the people as a prophet in mark 6 remember the woman at the well in John 4 she spent a little time with him and came to the right conclusions sir I perceive that you are a prophet Peter called him a prophet in Acts 3 Stephen called him a prophet in Acts 7 he called himself a prophet in Matthew 13 and Hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 through 4 says he was the greatest prophet that ever lived it says there God after he spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his son and he is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his nature Jesus was the supreme prophet and everybody knew it except one group the Pharisees refused to acknowledge him as such in Luke 7 they wouldn't do it so the city is stirred the city is shaken as we move in this week towards good Friday and you're contemplative of our Lord's crucifixion and then as we await the blessed Easter morning as you gather here to praise the resurrected Lord remember this he was not a victim the triumphal entry was his orchestrated demonstration to allow the two forces that had always been there to come to their climax and explode on the scene because his time had come and it was time for him to die Jesus died for you and Jesus died for me it was not a time of honor and recognition it was not a bright spot for him personally nor was he overcome by evil obedience to the father's plan
