[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] This Easter morning, who are you looking for? A dead hero or the risen Lord? Stay with us for the Bible hour.
[time=60] Welcome to an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=67] Our guest speaker today is Dr. Paul House, professor of Old Testament at Taylor University.
[time=73] His message is entitled "Who Are You Looking For?" We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of John chapter 20.
[time=82] We will be looking at verses 1 through 23.
[time=86] Special music today includes a song from Celebration and a solo from Denise Mitchell.
[time=95] Let's join our service as the sanctuary choir sings the Hallelujah chorus.
[time=116] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=127] For the Lord God who pivots and reigns, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=167] For the Lord God who pivots and reigns, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=177] For King Alma of this world, he is he wrong.
[time=188] For King Alma of our Lord, and of his Christ, and of his Christ.
[time=197] And he shall reign forever and ever.
[time=207] And he shall reign and he shall reign.
[time=210] For ever and ever.

[time=302] For ever and ever.
[time=306] And ever and ever.
[time=308] Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=312] Hallelujah.
[time=324] Thank you.
[time=327] You may be seated.
[time=330] I serve a risen Savior.
[time=332] He's in the world today.
[time=334] I know that He is living.
[time=336] He lives within my heart.
[time=340] (Organ music playing)
[time=349] I serve a risen Savior.
[time=352] He's in the world today.
[time=355] I know that He is living.
[time=358] [MUSIC - 167 seconds]
[time=532] What a great song of the affirmation of our salvation.
[time=542] We've sung some beautiful songs, the choir of sung Hallelujah under the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=549] We continue now with music as celebration comes to sing.
[time=552] I want to back us up just a little bit, a couple days ago, on Good Friday when Jesus Christ died for our sins.
[time=558] As we listen to this song, we want to meditate on that fact and know that Jesus paid the supreme sacrifice so that we could live.
[time=568] Let's listen as we review the events of the cross and then continue to joyously celebrate the triumphal resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=576] Oh, simply head, now wounded.
[time=600] [MUSIC]
[time=686] What thou my Lord has suffered.
[time=694] Was all force sinners gain.
[time=701] Oh, mine was the transgression.
[time=709] But thine the deadly pain.
[time=716] Oh, here I fall, my Savior.
[time=724] His ideas are thy place.
[time=730] Look on me with thy favor.
[time=737] O, sis me with thy grace.
[time=745] Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=753] [MUSIC]
[time=832] Oh, Chinese, oh, oh.
[time=836] Say, I love my Savior.
[time=840] My Savior, oh, oh.
[time=843] And Chinese, oh, oh.
[time=846] Say, I love my Savior.
[time=852] I say, oh, oh.
[time=862] Hello, and a joyous Easter Sunday to you.
[time=866] As we're taping this, we're just rejoicing in the fact that we have the privilege today to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=873] I have a special guest in the studio today.
[time=875] I'd like to introduce to you Dr. Paul House from Taylor University.
[time=878] Good morning, Paul.
[time=879] Good morning, Pete.
[time=880] Nice to have you back at Blackhawk.
[time=882] When I think of this morning and just all the celebration that took place in the fever pitch
[time=888] of excitement knowing that Jesus Christ arose just reminds me of the verse.
[time=893] I am the resurrection in the life.
[time=895] He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
[time=898] And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
[time=901] Isn't it a great morning?
[time=902] It's tremendous day.
[time=904] I was thinking as I was getting ready this morning of the various Easter's and where I found myself on Easter morning.
[time=910] Have you got a special Easter Sunday morning that you remember well?
[time=914] Yeah, I have five brothers and sisters, so we have a large family.
[time=918] An Easter Sunday morning, 1976, the last of us was baptized.
[time=923] So that meant all six of us had accepted Christ, and it was an exciting time to think that our whole family would be with Christ in heaven.
[time=930] Well, we praise the Lord for that.
[time=932] That's a great testimony.
[time=933] I remember living in Michigan.
[time=935] My dad was a pastor, and my sister played the coronet, and I played the trombone.
[time=940] In those days, we had early morning Easter sunrise services out in the farms, and we had farms surrounding the church, and I can't imagine what it sounded like, but we had a glorious time with a number of the church members gathered in that field of the highest hill we could find, and my sister and I played a duet, and my dad spoke.
[time=960] But those were days that I remember well of celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and I know we're going to do that here today as we continue to worship with music and the message in a little while.
[time=971] Last week, we had as our special guest and candidate for Senior Pastor Russell Moore.
[time=977] I'm happy to announce to our television audience that last Sunday evening, our membership voted to call Russell Moore as our Senior Pastor.
[time=986] That was a great evening, and the response from our members was overwhelming.
[time=991] Russell and his wife, Heidi, will be with us on May 19th.
[time=995] That will be his first official Sunday as Senior Pastor of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1000] What an exciting time we look forward to in the days ahead as the Moore's come and lead our church.
[time=1006] I'd like to tell you about one event that's coming up on April 12th.
[time=1010] That's a Friday evening.
[time=1011] We're going to have the AD players from Texas join us for an evening of dinner, and then humorous drama.
[time=1019] It'll be a good night for Christians to come together, eat together in fellowship, and then enjoy the humor of the AD players, and yet they have a point that they like to make in each one of their dramas.
[time=1030] I hope that you'll join with us.
[time=1032] Tickets are available now.
[time=1034] If you'd like to call the church at 493-7400, ask about the AD players and how you can obtain tickets.
[time=1042] That's Friday evening, April 12th.
[time=1045] I hope that you'll join with us.
[time=1048] Just a week or so ago, I wrote a letter to the members of the Founders Club, and in the dividend letter and the responses about ten years ago, a young man was watching the Bible hour sitting on his bed very despondent and was flipping through the channels and stopped at the Bible hour, listened to the program, after the program was over, he bowed his head and recommitted his life to the Lord, and that was the beginning of a healing in his marriage.
[time=1075] He wrote to me in the last couple weeks and said that it's been ten years, and now he's a marriage counselor.
[time=1081] Dr. House, that's an encouragement thing for us to hear from someone that just happened to turn on the television, and his life was changed that day.
[time=1089] I'm really grateful for that.
[time=1091] It's an encouragement, isn't it, to hear of young people, even as you work with them at Taylor University?
[time=1096] Yeah, it's great to hear from people because it lets you know that the reason the program's going on is being effective.
[time=1101] That's right.
[time=1102] Well, we're glad that you tuned in to us today, and we'd like to, just before we go back to our service, remind you that this will be the last Sunday that we will offer to you the videotape by Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=1114] He was here, and he spoke in an evening, a very powerful message.
[time=1117] We put it on videotape, and we'd like to make it available to you.
[time=1121] You can receive this videotape by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1132] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, the zip code is 46815.
[time=1141] As you write, please enclose a donation of $15 to help to free the cost of providing this tape.
[time=1148] We're going to go back to the live portion of our regular program now with more music from Denise Mitchell, and then our Easter message from Dr. Paul House from Taylor University in upland, Indiana.
[time=1160] [MUSIC - 293 seconds]
[time=1459] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1474] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=1479] Father, we thank you in the midst of our difficulties throughout this week that we have called on you many times because we know that you are unshakeable.
[time=1488] That you're there at all times, and you're there for every circumstance, and you're there when each one of us call upon you individually. Thank you for that. Thank you for the Savior.
[time=1503] We think of circumstances today where we need to pray that you will intervene in support.
[time=1510] We're thankful for our young people who have gone to Florida to work with Operation Outreach and pray that we thank you for the safe journey, and now as they work throughout this week to witness, you'll give them brave spirits and an openness to share what they know to be the truth that God lives.
[time=1529] He lives today.
[time=1532] There are still many of our family that are hurting today because of physical illness. We just pray that you will be with Kevin Bozales. He recuperates from an automobile accident. Pray forget Greg Hindle and his struggle for life.
[time=1549] Lord, we are celebrating today the fact that we have a new pastor and we pray for Russell and Heidi Moore as they make the necessary adjustments to come to Indiana.
[time=1560] We pray that you will continue each day to confirm this decision on them and on us that we will continue to pray and be faithful in our service here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1571] Thank you for those that are watching by way of the Bible hour, and we're thankful for those that are faithful in supporting this ministry.
[time=1579] And if there are those who are ill today and looking at the program for the first time, we pray that they'll receive spiritual encouragement today from Brother House.
[time=1587] Bless him as he preaches. Give him freedom. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1595] We had a delightful time in our service two weeks ago as Dr. Paul House from Taylor University came and spoke to us.
[time=1601] Before that time I asked him to come for a couple weeks and I'm just delighted that this is a day when he is scheduled again to speak about the joyous resurrection of our Savior.
[time=1610] We're glad that he lives so close and has the opportunity not only to teach at Taylor but to fill in as pulpit supply around the area and in particular at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1620] Would you welcome again to our pulpit Dr. Paul House from Taylor University.
[time=1631] Thank you Peter. It is a tremendous privilege to be back here with you today. A friend of mine says he's always invited to churches twice, wants to preach and wants to apologize.
[time=1643] So I guess I'm back to apologize today for the last time you made me feel so very much at home and I appreciated the warm welcome I got here and the good response that you gave to the preaching of God's Word.
[time=1657] I rejoice with you that you have called a senior pastor. I think that's great news for all of you. I think it's particularly good news for your staff who have carried on so faithfully and so well in the absence of a senior pastor.
[time=1672] And I hope you will express to them your thanks. And I hope that indeed you will at least express your thanks verbally and if you get even more serious about it that you would give them maybe a little money.
[time=1685] And if you get even more serious about it, maybe you could send them all on a cruise or something. I believe that's all they told me to say to you.
[time=1695] You just use your imagination but seriously do thank your staff and do pray for them as they anticipate the coming of your new pastor.
[time=1706] I invite you to open your Bibles this morning to John's Gospel chapter 20, John's Gospel chapter 20 and we'll begin reading with verse 1.
[time=1717] I want to take the title for the sermon this morning from a question in verse 15 of chapter 20. Jesus asked Mary Magdalene who so faithfully and so graciously came to his grave to pay her respects to her friend that she had hoped would be the Messiah.
[time=1739] He asked her, "Who are you looking for here at this tomb?" And I want to ask you as you worship this morning, this Easter morning, who are you looking for?
[time=1751] Like Mary, are you looking for a fallen friend? Are you looking for a dead Savior? Or are you looking for the risen Lord, the one who can lead you all the days of your life?
[time=1766] Who are you looking for? Because I believe the resurrection makes all the difference in the world. It's the most practical of Christian doctrines.
[time=1779] One of the great privileges of my life has been to live to be as old as I am and to have grandparents still living.
[time=1788] Two of my grandparents still living in southwest Missouri. The other two only recently in the last few years passed away.
[time=1795] And I learned many things from them, excuse me, but particularly from my grandfather, Marion, I learned the importance of the resurrection.
[time=1804] Up in a little cemetery beyond my dad's farm, joining it separated only by offense. There is a little cemetery and a tombstone that says, "Wanda Marion, 1904 to 1937, my grandfather's first wife, my grandmother."
[time=1823] Long since gone to be with the Lord. Because of the experience of going through her death and then seeing the salvation of his oldest daughter, he was baptized and began to count on the resurrection.
[time=1837] I've seen him in the last decade or so. Stand beside the grave of two of his daughters and say to me, "I don't understand why I live on and they are still gone, but I believe in God and I trust the resurrection."
[time=1858] You see the resurrection hits us where we live. It touches us at our most sensitive nerves and it meets us in our greatest hour of need.
[time=1870] John chapter 20 and verse 1, "Early on the first day of the week while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance."
[time=1881] So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved and said, "They've taken the Lord out of the tomb and we don't know where they've put him."
[time=1889] So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. Both were running, but the other disciple out ran Peter and reached the tomb first.
[time=1898] He'd been over and looked in at the strips of linen lined there but did not go in. Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and he went into the tomb.
[time=1907] He saw the strips of linen lined there as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head.
[time=1913] The cloth was folded up by itself separate from the linen.
[time=1918] Finally, the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went inside. He saw and believed, but they still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.
[time=1929] Then the disciples went back to their homes, but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and one at the foot.
[time=1944] They asked a woman, "Why are you crying?" "They've taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they've put him."
[time=1951] And at this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. "Woman," he said, "why are you crying? Who is it you're looking for?"
[time=1963] Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you've carried him away, tell me where you've put him and I will get him."
[time=1970] And Jesus said to her, "Mary," and she turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabbonai," which means teacher and Lord.
[time=1980] Jesus said, "Don't hold on to me for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, I'm returning to my Father and your Father to my God and your God."
[time=1991] So Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news, "I've seen the Lord," and she told them that he had said these things to her.
[time=1999] On the evening of the first day of the week when the disciples were together with doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you."
[time=2010] After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side and his disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
[time=2016] Again, Jesus said, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
[time=2023] And with that, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they're forgiven. If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
[time=2036] Who are you looking for today? When we read the first nine verses of this chapter, we say it's pretty clear that Mary Magdalene was looking for a dead friend.
[time=2049] She was looking for a fallen martyr, someone who had unjustly been put to death, someone who had lived a perfect life, someone that she had hoped and dreamed would be the Messiah,
[time=2064] the one to rescue Israel from all their enemies. And she went to the tomb looking for that dead friend to pay her last respects.
[time=2075] When I was 17 years old, I was asked to become the pastor of the Belfast Baptist Church, an open country church in southwest Missouri that was surrounded by a cemetery.
[time=2088] There were only 10 or 15 folks, and so if you use the term loosely with my inexperience and my ignorance, I was the pastor of these few folk who didn't want to grow, who didn't want to do anything except have the same 10 or 15 folks.
[time=2105] They paid me $20 a week, and as I look back on it now, I think I must have been worth at least half of that, and so they were very kind to me.
[time=2115] One Memorial Day, we had an embarrassing thing happen. We had the same 10 or 15 people, but all around the church in the cemetery were folks looking for the graves of loved ones.
[time=2127] And they were talking and they were laughing and they were laying the wreaths, and I almost leaned my head out the window and said, "Do you people mind we're trying to have church in here? Could you hold it down?"
[time=2138] But I was so embarrassed that the numbers were larger in the cemetery than in the church that I kept my mouth shut and just carried on and tried to do the best I could.
[time=2148] What if those folks who came to that cemetery, or what if you who pay your respects in the same way on Memorial Day, what if you had gone to that cemetery and you had found the grave dug up, the body gone?
[time=2165] You would be outraged, you would be upset, and this is the way Mary was. She was certain that the body had been stolen and that outrage had been laid on outrage, that the crucifixion of innocent Jesus had been compounded by someone stealing the body.
[time=2187] And so she went to tell the disciples and they came and they were puzzled, verses 3 to 7, tell us they ran and John wouldn't go in.
[time=2197] Peter was always a little more impulsive, he went right on in and they saw that the grave clothes were gone, who in the world would strip a body naked and carry it away, who would leave the grave clothes there?
[time=2212] They were puzzled and verse 8 says that John saw and believed, but the text is kind of ambiguous, kind of open, isn't it?
[time=2223] Did it mean that he believed Mary, what she had said?
[time=2227] Did it mean he believed Jesus was raised? Because after all verse 9 said they still didn't understand what the Scriptures taught, he was still just a little confused and his faith was just a little halting because he was looking for a dead friend, a fallen martyred God.
[time=2251] I want to make this as practical as I know how today and ask you, who are you looking for this morning?
[time=2259] I suspect that some of you have come today because it's traditional in your family to attend church on Easter Sunday morning and we welcome you and we're glad that you're here.
[time=2272] Or maybe you grew up in this country and you think Christians ought to go to church on Easter Sunday and so it's kind of a civic minded thing you're doing today.
[time=2283] But really what you're worshiping and what you're marking this morning is a dead tradition.
[time=2290] Or maybe you've drifted away from the Lord and you've come back to church today because that's what you used to do.
[time=2296] You keep Jesus Christ dead all week long, but this week you've come to pay homage to him to spend a little time in church where they say they worship the dead God.
[time=2311] Maybe you're a committed Christian. You're worn out and tired.
[time=2316] You're beaten down by what's been happening to you this week and you think, "Oh, if people only knew what I'd been going through."
[time=2323] And Jesus doesn't seem very alive to you today.
[time=2328] I have good news for you.
[time=2331] We don't come here today to mark the passing of a deceased God.
[time=2338] For all of you who have come here today simply to mark a tradition, let me tell you, there's so much more for you here.
[time=2346] There is a risen Savior. And for all of you who are here today and you've fallen away from God and for all practical purposes, Jesus is dead in your life, let me tell you he is alive today just as alive as he was the day you ask him into your heart.
[time=2365] You can come back to a risen Savior.
[time=2369] You're here weary, tired, beaten down. And you might not even admit that to anybody but yourself.
[time=2378] Let me tell you, we are here with more than just a dead friend.
[time=2383] We are here with more than just a martyred God.
[time=2387] We are here today to worship the risen Lord, which is what Mary Magdalene found in verses 10 to 18.
[time=2396] She came to seek a dead friend but she was encountered by a risen Jesus Christ.
[time=2405] Who are you looking for today?
[time=2407] Would you not look for a dead friend but would you look please for the risen Lord?
[time=2412] Because verses 14 to 17 show us unmistakably that Jesus Christ had conquered death.
[time=2421] Jesus Christ was no longer deceased. He was alive again.
[time=2427] And that means as we worship Jesus Christ, we have one who defeats death not only for himself but also for us.
[time=2437] And you think about this, a God who is alive.
[time=2444] It's amazing how vain we can be as human beings. It's doubled when we think of the vanity of some of the dictators of the past.
[time=2458] I was in Moscow in December last year and went to see Red Square.
[time=2470] Part of Red Square is Lenin's tomb. I could not bring myself to go in and file past the body of this man who had sent Russia into seven decades of darkness and death.
[time=2485] But they tell me he is there preserved. You can see the body. Such was the vanity of Lenin and his followers.
[time=2492] I'm told if you go to China they have taken Mao Seitung's body.
[time=2498] That man who ruled a fourth of the world's people with an iron fist.
[time=2505] And there they have preserved his body. You can see it. His body is there.
[time=2510] And I suppose if you went to the Middle East you could go to the site where Muhammad's body is and it's an old illustration.
[time=2518] And it's one used very often but let me just say you can go to Jerusalem and you will not find the body of Jesus Christ.
[time=2527] He is alive. He's conquered death and he's conquered it for us.
[time=2534] One of the privileges of being the only minister in the family is that I get to do all the family funerals.
[time=2542] Now I'm not sure that's a blessing or not. It is indeed an honor to be chosen and to be asked.
[time=2548] But it gets a little old sometimes because when my aunt went to be with the Lord they asked me to do the funeral.
[time=2557] When my uncle who had been such a support to me and encouragement to me not spiritually but every other way he could die they asked me to come.
[time=2565] When my grandmother who had given me such sage advice and was such a lively person.
[time=2572] So interested in what was going on in the lives of others was she that often at six o'clock in the morning she would call my mother and say what are you doing?
[time=2580] My mother was sleeping at six o'clock in the morning.
[time=2584] The grandma only needed four hours of sleep and so she was.
[time=2588] As my father said what do you do with a hyperactive grandmother?
[time=2593] And she was always alive and well.
[time=2597] And she loved me in her own way. I did her funeral.
[time=2603] When my grandfather who was converted after the age of sixty who never quite understood the grace of God who when I found him reading his Bible coming to his house after grandma died said I have to do this to see your grandmother again.
[time=2620] When he passed away this man who had taught me so much who I think if genetically I have a sense of humor it may have come from him when he passed away or when my mother was going to be with the Lord they called on me and a dozen other times like just yesterday.
[time=2644] When a family said could you bring the funeral sermon?
[time=2649] I've had the awesome privilege the awful privilege of trying to comfort people.
[time=2656] I don't have anything brilliant to say.
[time=2659] I don't have anything profound to declare except this.
[time=2664] Those who live and believe in Jesus Christ never die.
[time=2669] And then that startling question Jesus asked right after that.
[time=2673] He said do you believe this? I do.
[time=2676] And I may be sentimental and I may get a little sloppy with it but I want to tell you this.
[time=2682] If I didn't believe that I would see those loved ones who knew Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior again.
[time=2690] If I didn't believe that all those who passed away with faith in Jesus Christ that I would see them again I would not dare to be a Christian minister because it would be a farce.
[time=2705] What do we have that's better? What do we have to offer that's greater?
[time=2709] Jesus Christ conquered death and he's conquered it for every single one of us.
[time=2716] What else did Mary learn? Verse 17 Jesus said I'm going to be with the Father.
[time=2722] I'm going to spend time with him. Tell the disciples I'll be back.
[time=2728] Mary found out that day that Jesus Christ the risen Lord has conquered death.
[time=2733] She also found out that he was equal with God.
[time=2737] And that if Jesus Christ is equal with God he rules all things doesn't he?
[time=2742] Choir did a tremendous job with the Hallelujah Chorus and all the other special music today really stirred my heart made me think about the resurrection.
[time=2752] But isn't that great? It's my favorite part of the Hallelujah Chorus when they quote Revelation 11 15 the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of God and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and forever.
[time=2771] Jesus Christ will rule all things because he goes to be with the Father.
[time=2776] I'm excited about that because we live today with imperfect governments.
[time=2783] We live today with injustice. We live today with high taxes and trying to figure out how to spend them.
[time=2794] We live in a world that is far from perfect but let me tell you the coming time when Jesus Christ will rule.
[time=2802] And the Bible says all tears shall be wiped away from the eyes.
[time=2806] There will be no more sickness. There will be no more pain.
[time=2808] Not only that there will be no more injustice and there will be no more enemies because Isaiah says in chapter 11 the child will play with a snake.
[time=2820] The lion and the lamb shall lie down together.
[time=2825] The enemies will be reconciled and I suppose even Baptists will get along then because we will be open under new management.
[time=2836] We will be open with a new government and he shall reign forever.
[time=2844] And that's what he was telling Mary when she met the risen Lord and he not only said this but he said I the risen Lord want a relationship with these disciples.
[time=2855] Now you stop and think about that that's an amazing thing.
[time=2858] He said you go tell the disciples that I'm going to go be with the Father.
[time=2861] Other texts say that he told them I'll meet you in Galilee.
[time=2865] John chapter 21 says he came to them beside the Sea of Galilee and helped them fish and shared a meal with them and told Simon Peter to feed my sheep.
[time=2873] You say so what don't you remember who these disciples are.
[time=2879] Do you remember who deserted Jesus in his greatest hour of need.
[time=2884] Do you remember who fell asleep during the prayer meeting that so bothered Jesus.
[time=2888] It was these disciples and he said I want a relationship with them.
[time=2892] It's an amazing thing to know that Jesus has conquered death.
[time=2896] It's an amazing thing to know that he's going to rule all things to me.
[time=2900] It's just as amazing to know he wants a relationship with poor sinful Paul house and with poor sinful you because he loves you.
[time=2911] And he died for you and he wants to come into your life and change everything that needs to be changed and reaffirm everything that's good in your life.
[time=2923] Jesus Christ wants a relationship with you. Who are you seeking today?
[time=2931] Would you seek the risen Lord? The one who not only rules but the one Philippians two says emptied himself became like us and spent time with us.
[time=2945] Who are you looking for today?
[time=2948] Verses 19 to 23 though take us one step farther.
[time=2952] Have you ever noticed that all of the resurrection stories end with Jesus sending the disciples out that Matthew chapter 28 ends with the Great Commission?
[time=2963] ends with Jesus telling us to go into all parts of the earth? Do you ever notice that Mark's gospel chapter 16 ends the same way with a command to go?
[time=2973] Luke chapter 24 says power will come to you and you will be my witnesses?
[time=2979] Do you notice that he says here I'm sending you into the world?
[time=2985] Who are you looking for today? I hope you're not just looking for a dead friend.
[time=2989] I hope you're not even just looking for a risen Lord because there's so much more.
[time=2992] Surely we don't just want to be saved.
[time=2994] Surely we want a Lord who will lead and guide us all the days of our lives.
[time=3000] Surely we want a perfect leader and that's what we find in these verses.
[time=3004] Jesus says I'm calling you. I'm sending you.
[time=3010] The risen Lord today speaks to our hearts and says will you go?
[time=3015] When I was a little boy I had been hearing about the gospel.
[time=3022] I knew my parents were Christians. I knew my grandparents were Christians.
[time=3025] I have a wonderful heritage that way.
[time=3028] My oldest brother and sister had already made professions of faith and been baptized.
[time=3032] And one Sunday afternoon I don't remember what prompted it, but I sat down at the kitchen table and I talked to my dad about how you become a Christian.
[time=3040] And he explained to me what it meant to be saved and he prayed with me in that Sunday night.
[time=3047] I went down the aisle and our pastor shared with me the plan of salvation, made sure I understood everything and I made my profession of faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3055] Why? Because God was calling to me like He is to some of you today.
[time=3060] Saying to those of you who are filled with guilt, who are filled with shame, who are filled with regret, God is saying to you I will save you, I will forgive you.
[time=3070] When I was 12 years old I had been to a youth camp and they had taught us to seek God's will for your life
[time=3078] and pray and ask Him what you ought to do with your life.
[time=3080] I'm so glad that I wasn't any older than that because I was just naive enough to pray and ask God what He wanted me to do with my life.
[time=3088] I did a hot August Sunday morning in a revival in which a friend of mine put it this way.
[time=3095] There was not a fish flop and not a decision anywhere.
[time=3101] Sometime during that service God laid it on my heart that I was to be a preacher.
[time=3108] And when I gave the invitation I answered the call.
[time=3111] I didn't have anything to offer God.
[time=3113] I didn't have education or experience or brains or anything. God called me just like He is calling some of you.
[time=3120] When I was finishing my doctoral work I was taking a class that I really despised.
[time=3125] They had brilliant ideas for teachers like let the students decide what the standards will be.
[time=3130] Let the students decide how much reading they will do if they will have tests or not and how they are going to be graded.
[time=3137] Now obviously these folks hadn't read Genesis 3 which talks about the fall of the human race.
[time=3142] I remember that when I was a student if they let me decide I wouldn't decide on a whole lot would you.
[time=3148] So anyway it was that kind of class but in the midst of that mess God called me to teach.
[time=3154] And I remember it distinctly thinking well I've got to teach is what God wants me to do.
[time=3159] And trying to trust Him for the way to be able to teach in a college.
[time=3165] I don't know what God's calling you to do but I know this the risen Lord's calling you.
[time=3170] He's speaking to your heart today and say would you respond?
[time=3173] I'm sending you but I'm not sending you without resources because look at verse 22.
[time=3178] He breathed on them and said receive the Holy Spirit.
[time=3182] A lot of confusion about the Holy Spirit today.
[time=3185] It's such a shame because there's not a gentler more self-effacing person in the Bible than the Holy Spirit.
[time=3192] He just wants to magnify Jesus.
[time=3195] The Bible says in Ephesians 1 that when we receive Jesus we're sealed with the Spirit.
[time=3200] Every Christian has a spirit within them.
[time=3203] Now maybe it's too simplistic but I've heard all the formulas I can stand.
[time=3207] Let me tell you this you want to walk in the Spirit of God.
[time=3211] Every day you say to God I want to do what you tell me to do.
[time=3215] I want to obey your word.
[time=3217] I want to be sensitive to other people.
[time=3220] Lord help me do your will today.
[time=3224] And make yourself open to it and the Holy Spirit will give you the power to do what you need to do.
[time=3230] I believe today whatever job you're called to.
[time=3235] God's going to be there with you.
[time=3237] I've done all kinds of things.
[time=3239] I grew up working in the chicken houses.
[time=3240] I've been a janitor.
[time=3241] I've been a maintenance man.
[time=3243] I've done lower work.
[time=3245] I've been a pastor.
[time=3246] I've been a teacher.
[time=3247] I've done all kinds of things.
[time=3249] Just can't hold a job it seems.
[time=3253] But I've noticed this whatever it is you do.
[time=3256] God's there with you because he sent you there.
[time=3259] He will not call you unless he empowers you.
[time=3262] And let me say this when he calls you he challenges you.
[time=3265] He says in verse 23 if you forgive anyone his sins they're forgiven.
[time=3269] If you do not forgive them they're not forgiven.
[time=3271] What's Jesus telling them?
[time=3272] I am sending you as agents of forgiveness in my world.
[time=3278] What a challenge.
[time=3281] God is asking us to take reconciliation to the lost world.
[time=3287] Some of you are bored with life and you're looking for a challenge.
[time=3290] Let me tell you giving yourself to Jesus Christ and serving him takes the very best that you've got.
[time=3296] It will take all your best talents.
[time=3298] It will take all the energy you've got.
[time=3301] And it will be worth it every single bit.
[time=3305] I remember when my brother went to the Marine Corps.
[time=3308] It was not popular.
[time=3310] He signed up for the Marine Corps right after Vietnam.
[time=3312] And there's slogan was we're looking for a few good men.
[time=3316] Trying to challenge young men and women to enter into the Marine Corps.
[time=3321] I want to challenge you in a similar way.
[time=3323] God's looking for outstanding people.
[time=3327] He wants to challenge you to bring out the very best you've got.
[time=3332] For you see nothing else is worthy of a risen Lord.
[time=3339] Who are you looking for today?
[time=3342] If you're looking for a challenge, Jesus has it.
[time=3349] If you're looking for someone who conquers death, he's the one.
[time=3355] Today whatever you need, from salvation to assurance to comfort, our Lord has it.
[time=3362] Would you receive it from him?
[time=3364] Who are you looking for today?
[time=3366] Let's pray together.
[time=3369] Father, we ask that as your spirit works in the hearts and minds of these people,
[time=3378] that you would move them to respond to you in the way you're leading.
[time=3384] Take away the lies of the devil.
[time=3386] Take away the worries of this life.
[time=3389] And help them to clearly see the gospel.
[time=3393] Help those who aren't Christians to receive you.
[time=3396] Help those who are believers, but weary, defeated, rebellious.
[time=3401] Help them to come home to you.
[time=3404] And help those who are here in your call today to respond.
[time=3408] In Jesus name, amen.
[time=3410] Our invitation.
[time=3439] I hope you enjoyed the music today from our Sanctuary Choir as they presented the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah.
[time=3446] Appreciated to the ministry of celebration and soloist Denise Mitchell.
[time=3452] If you have an opportunity today and you want to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to have you take this moment and bow your head and pray this prayer with me.
[time=3462] Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3468] And today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3472] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3477] In Jesus name, I pray, amen.
[time=3481] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3485] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
