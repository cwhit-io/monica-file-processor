[time=85] What is it that gets you going?
[time=87] What gets you started and keeps you going?
[time=89] Is it money or power or position?
[time=92] One researcher suggests that it is recognition more than it is money, but what about in God's world?
[time=99] Look with me today at God's primary motivator for his people.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=116] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=121] Thank you for joining us.
[time=123] Speaking today is David Fitzer, Associate Professor of Communication at Moody Bible Institute.
[time=129] His message is entitled, "Routine Faithfulness." We encourage you to locate your Bibles and study along with us.
[time=137] Special music today includes a solo from Kevin Rowe and a song from Corinne Sick of Hoos.
[time=146] We now join our service with a song from the Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra entitled, "Let Jesus be Exalted."
[time=155] [MUSIC]
[time=170] We've gathered here today to worship and magnify the sun.
[time=182] Come, forget about the day and let this be the hour that your soul can find in strength,
[time=195] for we need thee, O Lord, lend our hearts in one accord.
[time=203] Make your presence known and be exalted in this place.
[time=210] Let Jesus be exalted in this place, I can feel his power here today.
[time=220] Let us feel it, take the soul and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=226] We thanks to you, O Lord, for the best you have shown.
[time=233] Blessed is your name, that Jesus be exalted.
[time=243] [MUSIC]
[time=246] His love is faster than the sea,
[time=253] and his word provides my every need.
[time=260] Master, you're my joy and my song.
[time=267] It was you who brought into my life new home.
[time=273] We need thee, O Lord, lend our hearts in one accord.
[time=281] Make your presence known and be exalted in this place.
[time=287] Let Jesus be exalted in this place, I can feel his power here today.
[time=297] O, the spirit, take the soul and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=304] We thanks to you, O Lord, for the best you have shown.
[time=310] Blessed is your name, that Jesus be exalted.
[time=320] And Jesus be exalted in this place, I can feel his power here today.
[time=330] O, the spirit, take the soul and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=335] We thanks to you, O Lord, for the best you have shown.
[time=346] Let Jesus be exalted in this place, I can feel his power here today.
[time=355] O, the spirit, take the soul and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=363] We thanks to you, O Lord, for the best you have shown.
[time=374] Blessed is your name.
[time=377] And Jesus be exalted in this place, I can feel his power here today.
[time=404] O, the spirit, take the soul and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=478] Continue with music now as Kevin Rowe comes to sing.
[time=480] Let's draw our hearts to the message that he has in song.
[time=484] [MUSIC]
[time=512] Everybody in their right mind would have given up the preaching and headed for home.
[time=521] They'd been warned a hundred times.
[time=526] But something inside them kept giving them hope.
[time=531] Just when you think they'd be crying instead of the tears, there's joy in their eyes.
[time=541] What kind of joy is this?
[time=546] A council of blessing to suffer.
[time=550] What kind of joy is this?
[time=555] It gives a prisoner his song.
[time=560] What kind of joy could stare at death in the face and see it as sweet victory?
[time=569] This is a joy of a soul that's forgiven and free.
[time=577] [MUSIC]
[time=584] Anybody else with his pain would want to shake a fist in heaven, give up the fight.
[time=593] This trouble had been Paul's little name.
[time=598] Ever since he'd been captured by God's blind and light.
[time=603] Just when you think he'd be dying, ever so soon, his eyes are a flame.
[time=612] What kind of joy is this?
[time=617] A council of blessing to suffer.
[time=622] What kind of joy is this?
[time=626] It gives a prisoner his song.
[time=631] What kind of joy could stare at death in the face and see it as sweet victory?
[time=641] This is a joy of a soul that's forgiven and free.
[time=650] [MUSIC]
[time=665] What kind of joy is this?
[time=679] Father has promised his children.
[time=683] And what kind of joy is this?
[time=688] That Jesus has come to reveal.
[time=693] What kind of joy could give hope in this world to someone just like you and me?
[time=702] This is a joy of a soul that's forgiven.
[time=707] I found this joy for my soul that's forgiven and free.
[time=714] [MUSIC]
[time=726] What kind of joy is this?
[time=731] [MUSIC]
[time=737] This is the joy that's forgiven and free.
[time=742] [MUSIC]
[time=746] Do you have this joy in your soul?
[time=753] A joy that's forgiven and free.
[time=760] [MUSIC]
[time=763] A joy that's free.
[time=768] [MUSIC]
[time=776] Hello and thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour.
[time=779] We've had a number of messages recently on our television broadcast concerning the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=785] What a wonderful theme to carry throughout the year.
[time=788] Jesus Christ died rose again for our sins that we might have eternal life.
[time=793] That is the theme of the Bible and the Bible Hour.
[time=797] I hope that you'll stay tuned today and join us for the music and message from God's Word.
[time=802] If you're watching in our local area on Sunday evening, April 14th, we're going to have a group from the Shepherds home from Wisconsin.
[time=810] This is a home where there are about 160 young people who are mentally disabled.
[time=815] They're bringing a handbell choir to Blackhawk Baptist Church on Sunday evening, April 14th at 6 o'clock.
[time=821] I hope you can come and join and see what God can do with these disabled young people.
[time=827] It's really quite a miracle.
[time=829] We've had a number of good speakers, outstanding speakers at Blackhawk over the recent days.
[time=835] Today, I'd like to welcome again David Fetser. Good morning, David.
[time=838] Good morning, Pete.
[time=839] Nice to have you back and how are things at Moody Bible Institute?
[time=842] Very good. Very good. We're wrapping up another school year, about six weeks to go, which is always exciting to the students at least.
[time=849] I know that you preach a number of Sundays, most Sundays in churches. I think you've been in around 200 churches around the Chicagoland area.
[time=860] Give me some insights on some of those churches and how does it feel to come in as a stranger, but with a great message?
[time=867] Well, it's fun to go into different churches and sense what God is doing in different areas, different locales.
[time=874] I get in every kind of church. Some of them are older churches with a rich history, some of them are new, some of them are small, some of them are bigger churches, some of them are struggling.
[time=886] Others of them are making a terrific impact on their community.
[time=889] I'm sure that all churches need to constantly be evaluating their programs and their style because people walk into church, and I know you've mentioned you sense right away kind of the atmosphere of what's happening.
[time=902] And we need to be cognizant of that even here at Blackhawk that we're really paying attention to the needs of the people in meeting those needs and not just having a service.
[time=912] And even that's true of the Bible. We hope that we're meeting your needs as you watch from week to week and that you have spiritual growth and encouragement as you listen to the music.
[time=922] I want to tell you about a book that we just received in the last couple weeks I read through it. It's entitled The Two Futures.
[time=930] It's written by David Breeze, who is the Director of Christian Destinies out of Kansas, an outstanding book comparing the two different futures for the unsaved person and the person that knows Jesus Christ is his Savior.
[time=944] Let me tell you, they are distinctively different, and in the coming weeks here we're going to explain a little bit more about what this book has to say concerning the life in the future for the Christian as well as the unsaved.
[time=957] I'll make some comparisons even next week, but an excellent book that you can receive absolutely free if you write to the Bible Hour today.
[time=965] So the book is entitled The Two Futures and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=978] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=988] I hope that you'll write for this book today. David, you have kind of a heritage of Fort Wayne. You're from Ohio, but your wife grew up and lived for a while here.
[time=998] Is that right? It's right.
[time=1000] I think she was born in Iowa, but moved to Fort Wayne and spent most of her early years here in Fort Wayne, so we kind of came home last night.
[time=1007] Great. We're glad to have Cheryl with us today, too. That's really special to ever come back to Fort Wayne. We've talked, David, about our new pastor.
[time=1016] We've mentioned it several times. His name is Russell Moore. His wife's name is Heidi, and they're going to be with us on May 19th.
[time=1023] We're really excited. We've enjoyed so much our visiting speakers, but we're delighted to have a senior pastor.
[time=1030] Well, I'm sure that will be a terrific benefit to the church to level out in that area.
[time=1035] If you're watching the Bible Hour and you're accustomed to watching it, we'd like to have you just come on that Sunday and be with us here in the service on May 19th,
[time=1043] and welcome our new pastor and his family to Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1047] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our service and hear some more music, and then the message from our special guest, David Fitzer.
[time=1054] Stay with us, please, and enjoy the fellowship and the inspiration from the Bible Hour.
[time=1060] Thank you, Lord, for the trials that come my way.
[time=1076] In that way I can grow each day as I let you lean.
[time=1088] And thank you, Lord, for the patience those trials bring.
[time=1099] In that process of growing, I can learn to care.
[time=1111] But it goes against the way I am to put my human nature down and let the spirit take control of all I do.
[time=1135] For when those trials come, my human nature shouts that they should live.
[time=1148] And as a property, can be easily and more.
[time=1159] I thank you, Lord, for the victory those trials bring.
[time=1171] In surrender of everything, life is so worthwhile.
[time=1182] And never give up, that when everything's put in place, out in front, I can see your face.
[time=1201] And it's near me, Lord.
[time=1231] Let's pray together.
[time=1241] Our Father, we come before you so thankful for this day.
[time=1245] I thank you that we have the privilege to see your earth come alive again and see flowers,
[time=1251] budding in trees, blossoming.
[time=1254] We thank you for the life that you put in our lives, Lord, we confess sometimes that things do get a bit mundane.
[time=1264] We take things for granted.
[time=1266] As Ray prayed earlier, that we're so thankful for our people and their faithfulness to the Lord's work here.
[time=1273] We're thankful when you put trials in our way, that you're not there just to put the trials there, but you're there to help us through the difficult circumstances.
[time=1283] We pray for George Wiggen and his family and the loss of their daughter Kay.
[time=1290] We pray that you will just sustain them in this time of loss and give them extra strength.
[time=1296] And that peace that we speak of so often that it passes all understanding.
[time=1301] Pray for Phyllis Catrol and the loss of her mother this week that you will just help her to claim to good memories and remember her mom in that way and give her strength during this difficult time of adjustment.
[time=1316] Thank you that Kevin Bussell is recovering from an auto accident and that he's doing better and we pray that this will be a good day so that there'll be no extra surgery necessary.
[time=1327] Lord we know that as we gather together here in a congregation like this that there are some difficult problems between mom and dad and brother and sister and mom and daughter and dad and son.
[time=1341] We pray that you'll just help people today to love you when they put you first that this love then permeates their loved ones and we pray that difficult situations might be mended.
[time=1353] Lives might be healed again because of these strenuous circumstances that come into our homes and pray that we'll be found faithful and praying to you for that strength and guidance.
[time=1364] Thank you for our counselors and our workers in our church that day after day gently guide people to a healthy life again.
[time=1372] Pray that you'll bless them in a special way as they deal with these difficult situations.
[time=1378] Bless us now as we open thy word, bless David Fetser as he ministers to us that our hearts will be open and receive a blessing from you in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1389] The privilege again to have David Fetser back with us, I believe this is about his third time of ministering to us during this interim period without a pastor.
[time=1397] David is from Moody Bible Institute, teaches in the communications department there and formally was a professor at Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon when I was there.
[time=1406] A great friend, great preacher of the word is a great message today. Let's open our hearts as David comes to minister to us.
[time=1416] Thank you Pete and thank you again for the invitation to come back.
[time=1420] I am one of those who views the calling of a new pastor of this church with mixed feelings.
[time=1425] It means I don't probably get to come anymore. I'm unemployed again but that's been my role frequently in a lot of churches and I trust you will find as most churches do
[time=1435] that bringing a new senior pastor is an enhancement to your ministry and the staff will be complete and you can again work together in a new concerted effort to do the work of the Lord.
[time=1446] Coming to Black Hawk is a pleasure. It's just refreshing to be here and to see the great ministry that you have accepted from God and undertaken and are carrying out and are making an impact in this community.
[time=1459] But I was thinking about what it is that gets you going. What is it that gets you up in the morning and that gets you off and when it gets tough, what is it that keeps you going?
[time=1474] I just finished a little bit of spring vacation from the school and the morning that I had to go back, my alarm went off at 5.30 and I faced an hour and a half on the Eisenhower expressway.
[time=1488] I just was in bed a minute extra and I said the president hasn't mentioned my name lately. Nobody appreciates me down there. I'm not going.
[time=1498] And so I stayed in bed. I don't want to go. Until the telephone rang and it was the mortgage company and said, "Yo Dave, we need some money from you." And all of a sudden I was motivated and I got it went to work.
[time=1510] Well, you know, we are motivated by a lot of different things. One researcher says we are motivated by recognition. In fact, he suggested that we are more motivated by recognition than we are the promise of higher pay.
[time=1524] Do you believe that? Well, he thought so. That when a boss or a superior commences for work well done, that is more of a motivating driving force than the promise of advancement and higher pay.
[time=1537] But certainly finances, money, not just a lot of it, but enough is a motivating factor. And there are other things.
[time=1545] We are motivated by the possibility of position or of power. Sometimes we're motivated simply by the satisfaction of doing a job and doing it well.
[time=1556] I'm sure there are some people who are very motivated. They're almost driven. They're almost workaholics. And they love to tackle a project and accomplish something. It's a high degree of motivation to get going.
[time=1569] I'm sure there are other things, just the thought of security that motivates us and gets us at it. But the question for you this morning.
[time=1580] What about your spiritual life? What about our walk with God? What is it that motivates us there? What are some of the forces that drive us to accomplish for God?
[time=1597] What keeps us going in this spiritual life? What keeps us going in this progression toward heaven that we are upon? What is it that keeps us going?
[time=1607] I'm not sure that some of the things are very similar. Certainly some are motivated by position that they will accomplish something for God and that perhaps in the context of a church they'll have some position or a position of power.
[time=1624] Perhaps some are motivated by a high degree of satisfaction in doing a job for God and doing it well. I'm sure some are motivated by just the social drive to be and to be part of a group and to do things.
[time=1639] I'm not sure what is all the motivations, but I am certain that it goes beyond what it is that motivates us to do our daily efforts.
[time=1648] Because with God, we are going beyond the motivation of a paycheck, aren't we? We're going beyond the motivation of a bonus or a plaque or a gold watch.
[time=1659] We read from the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 4 about some of the factors that seem to motivate him and that he used to motivate these Corinthian believers.
[time=1674] Let me just pause and remind you about these Corinthian believers. I'm sure you're aware of the fact that they were a group of people probably much like we are.
[time=1685] They had their hands in a lot of things. Not all of them quite above board, and that's why Paul wrote to them.
[time=1693] They were apparently motivated in such a way that they found it beneficial to sue each other and take each other to court some kind of motivation working there.
[time=1703] They were motivated to argue over positions of leadership in the church and who was eating what, and they were motivated in such a way that they got themselves into moral dilemmas.
[time=1716] There were some interesting motivators working in their lives, perhaps not unlike what we find in our culture today.
[time=1724] So he wrote to some people who were struggling with motivation in the Christian life and listened to what he says in 1 Corinthians 4.
[time=1733] So then, "Man ought to regard us as servants of Christ and those entrusted with the secret things of God."
[time=1744] Now, it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court.
[time=1755] Indeed, I do not even judge myself. My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
[time=1764] Therefore, judge nothing before the appointed time. Wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and he will expose the motives of men's heart.
[time=1781] Look at that last line. At that time, each will receive his praise from God. Paul writes to some carnal believers, some believers who are struggling in the Christian life, and he speaks to them of the possibility, maybe I better use the word the probability, the likelihood of receiving praise from God.
[time=1808] These people receiving praise his praise from God for accomplishing what it is God has them to accomplish.
[time=1818] That's an incredible thought. That's a staggering thought to me. How could it be that these kind of people, Paul can say each one will receive his praise from God?
[time=1829] How is that accomplished, Paul? Let me take you two different directions on how that at least we perceive might be accomplished.
[time=1839] I tracked back to my childhood, my upbringing when I was brought into a Christian home and into the church very early.
[time=1849] I went from the maternity ward to the morning service. There was no in between. I grew up in the church. It was my life.
[time=1856] My parents were godly people involved in the ministry of the church and in international missions.
[time=1862] We loved the Lord in our house. As a result, I was introduced to Jesus Christ and came to trust him as my personal Savior, very early time in my life.
[time=1872] But somehow, through that whole upbringing process, godly family and a godly church, somehow, I guess I got in my mind that sometimes there had to be some big splash, some big effort, some big occasion when I would rack up enough points to win praise from God.
[time=1893] Perhaps somehow, somewhere, someone would be saved through something I would say and that would do it.
[time=1900] Or maybe I would achieve some office or some position and that would do it.
[time=1906] But as I went on in the Christian life and on into the ministry of Christ, I began to recognize that many did not agree with my thinking at all.
[time=1916] Some were not looking for that one or two big events to get enough points. Some just never hoped or dreamt to do anything big enough to get praise from God.
[time=1931] Oh, saved, yes, in the kingdom. But the idea of a personal accounting and praise from God, well, I guess I'll just put that off into the future and when it happens, it happens, but I'm not sure I can ever get ready for it.
[time=1947] Now listen to me, if either one of those extremes is true, then may I submit to you that the motivation of a future reckoning for Christians with the possibility of praise is really not very critical to our behavior.
[time=1963] It really is not very influential because it's too distant or too remote or too unknown or too unreachable, or may I add too misunderstood.
[time=1978] Is God really looking for some big event, some big splash, some big point getting time, or has God set his standards so high that few of us can ever hope to attain, only those with terrific gifts and only those with a public ministry will ever begin to attain the kind of thing that will bring
[time=2003] quote, praise from God?
[time=2008] Or is indeed Paul saying to this very, very normal group of believers, is he saying to them that God is looking for something much more attainable, much more accomplishable, something that any indeed every believer, including these Corinthians is able to accomplish?
[time=2032] It seems to me that the motivating force and the motivating requirement can be summed up in one word of one verse in this passage.
[time=2043] It's in the second verse when he says to us it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove.
[time=2051] What's the word? Faithful. Faithful. Perhaps you have in your text the word trustworthy. Same idea.
[time=2058] Whoever is given a trust must prove to be worthy of that trust. They must be found to be faithful with the trust that has been given to them.
[time=2071] God has not called us to an unreachable standard. God has not called us to execute a few big moves and therefore win praise.
[time=2080] God has called us to the faithful discharge of all of the responsibilities of the Christian life daily. Would you get that? Let me repeat it. I want you to focus on it.
[time=2092] God has called us to the faithful daily discharge of all of the responsibilities and of the gifts that He has given to us on a daily basis. And that is attainable.
[time=2109] Here in 1 Corinthians chapter 4 Paul talks about what I like to simply call routine faithfulness. Routine faithfulness. I pastored for several years in a city in Ohio.
[time=2124] I guess as a pastor there came a place where I just really struggled with a perception of a lack of faithfulness. And I struggled with it in my own life.
[time=2134] And as I as a pastor watched others and I began to study this passage and others and came to the conclusion that God simply wants us to fall into an area of faithfulness that becomes a routine.
[time=2148] I'm remembering that the Lord Jesus Christ went out to pray as was His habit.
[time=2155] Daniel went up to that upper place three times a day to routine faithfulness in discharging all of the responsibilities of the Christian life. Not very popular these days.
[time=2169] Our athletes for example have suggested to us that it's not essential to mean to be faithful to the terms of a contract.
[time=2178] Our couples have suggested to us that it's not necessarily good to remain faithful to a vow that you made with someone else.
[time=2188] We don't live in a time when routine faithfulness is very popular. We're supposed to do our own thing. We're supposed to be free. Paul says it is required that we be found to be faithful.
[time=2202] Routinely faithful. John MacArthur calls it consistent obedience. Faithfulness, obedience that becomes a pattern or a way of life where when I break from the faithful discharge of my responsibilities of bell rings a light goes on and I have to confront my God with a breaking in the discharge of my responsibilities.
[time=2225] I believe that's the primary motivational force that Paul lays before us in the life of a believer, but I want you to notice just two details in all of this.
[time=2234] First I want you to focus on the people who are involved in God's motivational program. There are three words here in the text that alert me to the people who are involved. The first is in verse one.
[time=2244] Men ought to regard us as servants of Christ. The little word us suggests he's talking to a certain group of people who are those people. I track back in chapter one verse number two to the church of God in Corinth to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy.
[time=2264] That's a routine of faithfulness together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. That's the us that he's talking about those you and me who have called upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for deliverance from our sins to become our Lord.
[time=2284] We are the people that he addresses here. Men ought to regard us believers. The second word I notice is the word servants or your text perhaps has the word ministers of Christ.
[time=2300] A word that occurs frequently in scripture means a helper, an assistant, someone who serves someone else. Please don't just relegate it to a master servant role. In fact, the word that is used here is the word that is used of a physician's assistant.
[time=2321] Not quite a servant role, but the same idea. One who serves someone else, one who is there at the right time faithfully caring about the responsibilities of that occupation. I went to the dentist a few months ago. I wasn't quite sure everything was going on because I'm tilted back looking up into bright light there and gritting my teeth. Not exactly open to what he was doing in my mouth.
[time=2349] He was saying relax. I kept noticing that the young lady who was assistant was just perfect in putting the right tool in his hand at the right time. He didn't have to explain. He held out his hand and she knew what to put there. At a point in time, he held out his hand and she put the filling in. She did exactly what was required of an assistant, a helper, the word that is used here, ministers of servants of Christ.
[time=2376] There's another word in verse number one. As those entrusted, those who have been given a trust, the word there is the word steward. We've got believers, we've got assistants or servants, and we've got stewards, one who is entrusted with another person's goods.
[time=2398] The word steward means an administrator, a manager, Peter says in 1 Peter, everyone should use the gift that he has received to serve others faithfully administering, stewarding God's grace in all of its various forms, very encompassing there. We are stewards of God's grace.
[time=2420] So Paul says to us, put these all together, if you are a believer, then you are a servant. If you are a believer, then you are a steward. You are an assistant of Christ in his ministry, and you have been given a trust. Peter calls it a gift, something that is yours to carry out in the body of Christ.
[time=2443] What is that stewardship? I like the definition I read years ago in a pamphlet that came across my desk from Dallas Seminary. Somebody observed there that stewardship involves everything I do after I say I believe.
[time=2458] Paul says we are stewards of the secret things of God. Peter says we are stewards of the grace of God, not much else left, is there? Well, we've seen the people who are part of the motivational program notice the requirement of God's motivational program. It's in verse number two, we've already focused on it. It's required that they be found faithful.
[time=2486] Well, you notice what it does not say. The text does not say it is required that these stewards, these servants, must prove successful. They must prove profitable. They must prove busy. The text says they must prove faithful, trustworthy.
[time=2508] When I was a pastor in Ohio, I had a gentleman in my church who managed a JCPenney store. This was way before the Superstore concept, and he managed a little JCPenney store in the booming metropolis of Wapakoneta, you've been to Wapak, haven't you?
[time=2527] A terrific little city, but not the kind of city that at that time had a huge penny Superstore, just a little downtown store. Not very big, you could fit to half a dozen of them in this auditorium. Well, maybe two or three.
[time=2543] But just a little store, and I remember talking with Chuck one day and say, "Chuck, what does the company want out of you as the manager of this store? Do they want you to double the sales? Are they looking for you to expand this place?" Not really, Dave. He said, they've made it clear that what they want out of me is, as the Bible says, faithful discharge of the responsibilities they've given me to do.
[time=2569] And if I do what they tell me to do, if I run the promotions that they send me, the store will do well, and it will grow, and it will prosper, but we probably won't double or triple in a year's time. They want faithfulness out of me.
[time=2585] Perhaps you are one who, in the discharge of your duties for Christ, labors behind the scenes. You're not a manager. You're not a minister in the public sense. You're just doing your job behind the scenes.
[time=2603] Well, you notice that Paul has a word for you here this morning. Did you catch it in verse number two? It's required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. The little phrase must prove is interesting.
[time=2617] Let me illustrate it this way. I ordered some trees for my yard this week. I'm going all out. I ordered some trees out of one of those magazines. You know the good ones. I'm getting ten of them for 1895. You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[time=2636] I know what I'm going to get him in the mail is going to be a stick with some scrawny little roots on it, but even so, I'm going to dig a two-foot hole, maybe three, deep hole, and I'm going to fill it up with. And I was thinking about that the other night, planning these little stick trees that are guaranteed to grow eight feet a year.
[time=2655] There's a sucker every day. Anyhow, I was thinking about that. And because I'm a bit of a dreamer, I imagine myself out there in the yard digging that hole.
[time=2667] And I began to dig my hole, and all of a sudden I hit something hard. And in the light of this little eight-foot eight-inch tree, I just bent over and cleaned out this stuff I hit. It was gold. Gold in my backyard. A whole stream of gold through my backyard.
[time=2687] I'm rich. No more eight-inch trees. I'm going to bring in 50 footers. That's the idea here. Something that's hidden. Something that is under or something that is behind the scenes. Look what he says.
[time=2702] He says in verse two, "Must prove." But in verse five, he says, "He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness." I don't think the darkness there is the darkness of sin.
[time=2711] I think it's the darkness of being behind the scenes and work that's unseen. And he'll turn the spotlight on it and he'll see it in verse number five.
[time=2719] He will expose not just what's happening, but the motives of men's hearts. It's the idea here. The work that you're doing for God that no one knows about.
[time=2732] Oh, there's so much of that in the body of Christ, isn't there? Before the service this morning, I stopped in the TV room back there and was watching the folks. You know all those people back there, don't you? They're famous people, aren't they?
[time=2746] But they better do their job, or the folks watching this on television will not see it.
[time=2752] And some of you dropped your child off in the nursery. We've got some PhDs working in the nursery, PhDs and nursery skills, are they right? They're famous people.
[time=2762] No, no, no, no, no, no. People that count the money. And then perhaps this morning watching on TV is a lady or a gentleman who has found their stewardship taking care of a loved one for the last five years.
[time=2778] They don't get out too much, but their stewardship is that loved person.
[time=2784] Or perhaps a parent or two who is laboring under the difficulty of a child with a physical or emotional problem, and that's the stewardship that God's given to you.
[time=2795] And it's not in the newspapers. It's not on the screen, but it's what God has given to you.
[time=2801] You see Paul says he knows, and there will come a time when he'll turn on the lights, and he'll know about and reveal and reward the faithful discharge of his stewards.
[time=2817] I love to picture what it's going to be like when we stand in line before the Lord Jesus. Paul's going to be up there somewhere near the head of the line, and boy, what a commendation he's going to get, huh? Well done, Paul. Here's a crown for you.
[time=2831] Little ways behind Paul is Martin Luther. Oh, man. Martin Luther, what a terrific job you've done.
[time=2838] A crown that Martin's going to buckle under the load of that crown behind Martin Luther's Billy Graham.
[time=2845] Oh, man. What a crown that man's going to get. Behind Billy Graham is John Mary Doe from Black Hawk, from a little city in Ohio, somewhere out there in Illinois or California.
[time=2862] Just John Doe, but if I read 1 Corinthians 4, verse number 5 correctly, John and Mary Doe will receive their praise from God, just like Billy, just like Martin, just like Paul.
[time=2877] There's commendation and there's praise from God. Is that a motivating factor? I can't wait. Paul says, "Each will receive his praise from God, because each has learned routine faithfulness motivated not by judgment, but motivated by the sure reality of a coming Lord who will recognize those he loves and who love him
[time=2905] and who have served him faithfully all of these years." Does it matter? Does it really make any difference? Does it matter whether or not you are faithful in the discharge of your little responsibility? Let me tell you a story.
[time=2922] I'm going to read a story to you I got from Peter Marshall years ago, one of my favorites, just listen to this story about how much it matters. Once upon a time, a certain town grew up at the foot of a mountain range.
[time=2936] It was sheltered in the Lee of the protecting heights so that the wind that shuttered at the doors and flung handfuls of sleet against the window panes was a wind whose fury was spent. High up in the hills, a strange and quiet forest dweller took it upon himself to be the keeper of the springs.
[time=2954] He patrolled the hills and whenever he found a spring he cleaned its brown pool of silt of fallen leaves and of mud and mold and took away from the spring all the foreign matter so that the water that bubbled up through the sand ran down clean and cold and pure.
[time=2973] It leaped sparkling over rocks and dropped joyously in crystal cascades until swollen by other streams. It became a river of life to the busy town below.
[time=2984] Millwheels were whirled by its rush. Gardens were refreshed by its waters. Fountains threw it like diamonds into the air and swans sailed on its limped surface and children played, laughed beside the banks in the sunshine.
[time=3005] Ah, but the City Council. The City Council was a group of hard-boiled, hard-headed businessmen. They scanned the civic budget and found in it the salary of a keeper of the springs. Said the keeper of the purse, why should we pay this romance ranger? We never see him.
[time=3028] He is not necessary to our town's work life. Hey, if we build a reservoir just above the town, we can dispense with his services and save his salary.
[time=3040] Therefore, the City Council voted to dispense with the unnecessary cost of a keeper of the springs and to build a cement reservoir.
[time=3049] So the keeper of the springs no longer visited the brown pools but watched from the heights while they built the reservoir.
[time=3058] When it was finished, it soon filled with water, to be sure, but the water did not seem to be quite the same.
[time=3068] It did not seem to be as clean and, in fact, a green scum soon befiled its stagnant surface.
[time=3077] There were constant troubles with the delicate machinery of the mills, for it was often clogged with slime and the swans found another home above the town.
[time=3088] At last, an epidemic raged and the clammy yellow fingers of sickness reached into every home in every street and every lane, and the City Council met again.
[time=3099] Sarfili, it faced the City's plight, and frankly, it acknowledged the mistake of the dismissal of the keeper of the springs.
[time=3108] They sought him out of his hermit hut high in the hills and begged him to return to his joyous former labor.
[time=3115] Gladly, he agreed and began once again to make the rounds.
[time=3120] It was not long until pure water came, wilting down under the tunnels of ferns and mosses to sparkle in the cleansed reservoir.
[time=3131] Millwheels turned again as of old. Stench has disappeared, sickness waned, and convalescent children played in the sun and laughed because the swans had come back.
[time=3150] Please do not think me too eccentric, too extravagant.
[time=3156] When I say that I think there are an awful lot of people in the body of Christ who are keepers of the springs.
[time=3164] People who have been committed by God to a responsibility, they've accepted that ministry of helping.
[time=3173] They've accepted that ministry of encouraging. Their public ministry of years ago isn't there, and now they've accepted that ministry of quietly praying.
[time=3183] They've accepted that ministry of teaching, a group of sometimes unruly kids.
[time=3190] They've accepted that ministry of parenting, of ushering, of parking, whatever it is. They've accepted that ministry from God and like faithful keepers of the springs are the people who keep the waters pure.
[time=3204] Keep the millwheels running, and keep the body of Christ accomplishing our ministry.
[time=3211] We need you this morning. I don't know how discouraged you are. I don't know if you're ready to say, "We've got a new pastor coming. I can quit doing what I'm doing."
[time=3222] We need your exercise of your responsibility. Faithful. Faithful in your responsibility.
[time=3233] I hope a week or two from now, the date has escaped me that you are able to come and hear the people sing from the Shepherd's home.
[time=3244] I remember them hearing them years ago, and you know, they're the kind of people who could easily say, "God doesn't have anything for me."
[time=3253] But he did. And you'll hear a group of people with some serious limitations who fell into routine faithfulness.
[time=3263] And because of it, people around our country have been touched. I will never forget hearing them close their service.
[time=3270] And I don't want to tip off anything for you, but it just excites me to remember hearing them sing, "It will be worth it all when we see Jesus."
[time=3280] Isn't that right? When he says to us, "Well done, good in what?" Faithful. Serve it.
[time=3289] And because we are servants and because we are servants, we will be doubly honored to lay those crowns in all of that praise at his feet.
[time=3301] To God be the glory. Great things he has done. Great things he is doing through routine faithful servants like you and me.
[time=3314] Heavenly Father, we are again gratified and overwhelmed and yet brought to our knees humbled, challenged.
[time=3325] First with the understanding that you loved us enough to save us from our sin.
[time=3331] And then you gifted us with something that we can do for the body of Christ and for our Savior.
[time=3340] Stir us, Lord. Motivate us, Lord, with routine faithfulness. To fall into a pattern of prayer. To fall into a pattern of good works.
[time=3350] To fall into a pattern of ministry. It becomes our lifestyle, even as it was the lifestyle of our Savior.
[time=3360] I want to pause this morning with your heads bowed and your eyes closed. To ask you if I can pray for you this morning in the discharge of your responsibility.
[time=3371] Would you slip up your hand this morning and say, "Mr. Fitzer, I wanted to quit. Will you pray for me?"
[time=3380] Thank you. Oh, terrific. Lord, you see our hands. You understand that sometimes the road is heavy and the responsibilities seem overwhelming and the attractions of this world seem to draw.
[time=3397] For these many that raise their hand and for those watching in television this morning that may be in a difficult place of ministry.
[time=3407] Encourage us with the fact that we will stand before you and we will hear you say by the grace of God, "Well done, faithful servant."
[time=3418] Because He lives and because we will stand in your presence, we can face tomorrow. We can face tomorrow with a sure certainty that we are serving a loving and a rewarding Savior.
[time=3436] May our steps this week be energized, knowing that you're coming and the bright light will reveal that which we've done for you, even behind the scenes.
[time=3450] Thank you, Father. You're so good to us. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=3465] The closing song is 343. It's a reminder that as we serve the Lord together that we need to be still and know that He is God and that He heals the wounds and broken hearts that we have, and maybe some decisions that need to be made today with consulars on hand to pray with you, you come as we say.
[time=3488] We've been sharing with you music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and soloist, Kevin Roel and Kareem Sikafus. The message today was from our special guest, Dr. David Fetser from Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois.
[time=3503] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this very important prayer with you.
[time=3512] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins, and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3522] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3531] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3543] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or a copy of the booklet "The Two Futures," please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East-State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3558] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1494 or mention the sermon by David Petzer entitled "Routine Faithfulness," and please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3584] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club, a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry.
[time=3591] To learn how you can become a member of the Founders Club, please write directly to the Bible Hour, 7400 East-State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
