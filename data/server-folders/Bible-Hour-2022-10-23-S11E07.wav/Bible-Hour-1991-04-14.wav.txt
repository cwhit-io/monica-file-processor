[time=60] (Silence) (Silence) (Silence) (Silence) (Silence) (Silence) We are living in a day when a great emphasis is being placed upon being successful.
[time=95] There are a lot of books being written on the subject. David Lewis has written one entitled "The Secret Language of Success."
[time=102] In fact, there are even books that will teach you how to dress for success.
[time=105] But the greatest book in the world on the subject of success is still the Bible.
[time=110] This morning, we'd like to take an incident from the life of David and talk about this matter of seven principles for success.
[time=117] I hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=119] (Silence)
[time=130] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=136] Our special guest speaker today is Pastor Jim Godwin, assistant to the president at Grand Rapids Baptist College.
[time=145] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them ready so that you can study along with us.
[time=150] His text is taken from 1 Samuel 17 verses 17 through 50.
[time=155] Special music today includes a duet from Jennifer Crawford and Jenny Clancy and solos from Read Le Favor.
[time=163] Let's join our service with a song from the sanctuary choir entitled "Seakers of Your Heart."
[time=170] (Music)
[time=185] Until we give us praise, until we let you be.
[time=199] To fill us with your spirit, we knew us from within.
[time=214] (Music)
[time=242] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=249] Give our lives to the show.
[time=256] (Music)
[time=277] Because your heart was broken.
[time=284] Because you saw by me.
[time=291] Because you gave so freely.
[time=298] Because of Calvary.
[time=307] We can now be.
[time=313] (Music)
[time=334] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=341] Give our lives to the show.
[time=347] (Music)
[time=356] Jesus of your heart.
[time=364] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=371] Give our lives to the show.
[time=378] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=385] Give our lives to the show.
[time=393] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=405] Give our lives to the show.
[time=412] Lord, we want to know you.
[time=421] (Music)
[time=447] Run here near our blessed Lord to the cross where thou hast died.
[time=452] Oh, that might be our goal today.
[time=454] 358, please.
[time=456] Him number 358 will be singing verses one, two, and four.
[time=462] (Music)
[time=473] I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord, I am the Lord.
[time=597] Thank you very much for your good singing today, and many of you have smiles on your face as you sing.
[time=602] It's a great encouragement.
[time=605] Jenny Crawford and Jenny Clancy are going to come and sing a song now.
[time=609] It's entitled Another Time and Another Place.
[time=612] We accept Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.
[time=614] He promises great things for us, not always when we want them and not always in the exact time and place.
[time=620] But let me review for you some of the things that we can be assured of through Jesus Christ.
[time=625] We are given the presence and leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[time=628] We are promised that we will know the will of God.
[time=631] We have strength for every occasion.
[time=634] We are promised the supply of every need.
[time=637] We are promised always and the ever presence of Christ.
[time=641] In fact, we are promised everything, including assurance of eternal salvation.
[time=646] We have many of those things now, and many of them have been in your life, and sometimes God allows us to experience great things from him.
[time=654] But it's in his time and his place, and we'll rejoice with him when he comes again for us.
[time=671] I've always heard there is a land, beyond the mortal dreams of life, where every tear will be left behind.
[time=698] But it must be in another time, oh.
[time=708] There'll be an everlasting light shining up your rest, holy one, where every fear will be erased.
[time=723] But it must be another place, oh.
[time=737] So I am waiting for another time and another place, where all my hopes and dreams will be captured with one good in Jesus' face.
[time=756] Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps you, sometimes I can't hardly wait for that sweet sweet someday.
[time=772] I've grown so tired of earthly things, they promise peace but furnish pain.
[time=798] And all of life's sweetest joys combined, could never match those in another time, oh.
[time=814] Though I put my trust in Christ, I felt his spirit move in my life.
[time=823] I know it's truly just a taste of his glory and another place, oh.
[time=843] So I am waiting for another time and another place, where all my hopes and dreams will be captured with one good in Jesus' face.
[time=862] Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps you, sometimes I can't hardly wait for that sweet sweet someday.
[time=878] So I am waiting for another time and another place, where all my hopes and dreams will be captured with one good in Jesus' face, where all my hopes and dreams will be captured with one good in Jesus' face, where all my hopes and dreams will be captured with one good in Jesus' face.
[time=904] I'm waiting for another time and another place, where all my hopes and dreams will be captured with one good in Jesus' face.
[time=922] Oh, my heart, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps you, sometimes I can't hardly wait for that sweet sweet someday.
[time=938] I'll be trapped in one and I'll be stuck to another time and another place.
[time=968] Hello, and thank you for tuning in to the Bible Hour today.
[time=985] I am very appreciative of the letters and gifts that you've sent in support of the Bible Hour in this last week.
[time=991] It really is an encouragement to know that there are people out there, some of you have written that you weren't able to go to church for a number of weeks and had the opportunity to share with the Bible Hour and to worship together with us.
[time=1003] I'm glad that the program is an encouragement to you and I hope that you will continue praying for the Bible Hour and will invite others to watch the program.
[time=1011] We have a special guest here today. His name is Jim Godwin. Good morning, Jim. Jim, our relationship goes back a number of years as we fellowship together on the West Coast with representatives from Los Angeles Baptist College.
[time=1025] You were at Western Baptist College. We often had times together in, like say, Northern California. Do you remember those days?
[time=1032] I certainly do. We had some good times at Mount Herman and then when I went to Western Baptist College, you were the pastor of First Baptist Church in Richland, Washington. How long were you there?
[time=1042] About nine years now. And let's make a connection here. Let's see. Ken Nichols was here at our church and then was out at your area for a number of years too.
[time=1053] We brought him on staff to help us in the counseling area. Jim, you've recently come to the Midwest, a great place to be. Up in Michigan, you're assistant to the President of Grand Rapids Baptist College. Now, what does that mean?
[time=1073] Well, my responsibility there is primarily to help in the area of development and fundraising overlooking those areas.
[time=1080] School is a liberal arts and Bible college. It's a Christian liberal arts school, four-year credit in school, and we also have a seminary. We have about 150 students in our seminary program.
[time=1091] It's great. We took a team from Blackhawk up to the school last fall and gave a concert there in one of the chapels and had a great time. Dr. Wiltch has been there for a number of years and has really kind of been a stronghold of that school, hasn't he?
[time=1105] Jim, we are appreciative of your work, and not only as a pastor, but working with young people. My heart is where the young people are too, and I really do appreciate the Christian colleges that are training our young people to go out and serve.
[time=1117] Not only as pastors and missionaries, but just as great men of God in the business field, and I know that Grand Rapids is doing that. We have some young people that are considering going to the school even this fall, and I know that that's a fine place in which to study and to grow in the things of the Lord.
[time=1134] So, we look forward to your message this morning. Maybe just give us a little glimpse of what you're going to talk about.
[time=1139] We're going to be talking about the principles for success from the life of David. There's a lot being written today on this subject, and a lot being said about it in seminars, and we're just concerned that we look at it from a biblical perspective what God has to say about it.
[time=1153] Well, thank you, Jim. We look forward to your message in just a few minutes.
[time=1157] Thank you.
[time=1158] I told you last week about a book that's entitled Two Futures. Dr. David Breeze from Christian Destiny's often talks about things to come, the future for the Christian, as well as those that do not accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=1172] If you want to see a comparison, here's an excellent book to get the comparison of what the world's going to receive in the future, and what we as Christians have to look forward to in the presence of our Lord.
[time=1184] The name of the book, again, is Two Futures by Dr. David Breeze, and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1198] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1207] I find this book very refreshing and very helpful and confirming of the fact that we need to live for God, and then we can look forward to some great things that He has in store for us in the future.
[time=1218] A date that I'd like to have you keep in mind is April 28. That's a Sunday evening right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church. We'll have a kids musical.
[time=1226] The king's kids, Grades 1 through 3, will be doing a musical at 6 p.m. that evening entitled The Boy Who Believed. About 78 kids from Grades 1 through 3 will be joining together to perform this inspiring musical.
[time=1242] I hope you'll come. It's an encouragement to see the kids, and that time again is April 28 at 6 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1251] And then we want to remind you that our new pastor, Russell Moore, and his wife, Heidi, will be with us on Sunday morning May 19.
[time=1259] We're making that a special day. We're having a reception from 9.15 to 10.15, and then one grand service here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 10.30 a.m.
[time=1269] If you don't regularly attend church, I hope that you'll join us for that day as we welcome our new pastor, Pastor Russell Moore.
[time=1277] We go back to the live portion of our program now to enjoy the music and then the message from our special guest, Pastor Jim Godwin from Grand Rapids Baptist College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[time=1287] Stay tuned, won't you?
[time=1298] I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus since I found him a friend so strong and true.
[time=1312] I would tell you how he changed my life completely. He did something that no other friend could do.
[time=1331] No one ever cared for me like Jesus.
[time=1344] There's no other friend so kind as he.
[time=1358] No one else could take the sin and darkness from me.
[time=1373] Oh, how much he cared for me.
[time=1387] Now every day he comes to me with new assurance, and more and more I understand his words of love.
[time=1402] But I'll never know just why he came to save me till someday I see his blessed face upon.
[time=1419] No one ever cared for me quite like my sweet Jesus.
[time=1433] There's no other friend so kind as he.
[time=1447] No one else could take all the sin and the darkness from me.
[time=1462] Yes, oh, how much he cared for me.
[time=1494] Let's bow our heads together in the quietness of this hour. Let's just take a moment to individually thank the Lord for our families.
[time=1510] Perhaps pray for a need that you have, that you know of, that the church body doesn't know of, but God will know.
[time=1518] Just bow and pray and turn our eyes upon our Savior.
[time=1523] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[time=1535] Look full in his wonderful face, and the things of earth will grow strangely deep.
[time=1559] In the light of his glory and the great.
[time=1572] Thank you, our Father, for the encouragement that we receive because we come here and we look out in this audience and see people that want to know you more.
[time=1580] I want to be in this facility to serve you and to praise your name.
[time=1584] We thank you for the music, for the words from the Scripture that give us encouragement and praise on our lips because of what the Savior has done for us.
[time=1593] We pray for the prayers that we're offered just now that you will answer them according to your will and we pray for our people that are in need.
[time=1601] You will indeed intercede and give encouragement and physical strength and mental stability where it's needed.
[time=1609] We thank you that we can come together and know that as we gather together, our hearts will be strengthened because we're here, worshiping your name.
[time=1617] In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=1623] We have indeed made an effort to focus our thoughts on the Lord Jesus Christ and the growth that we can have in our lives when we center our thoughts on Him today.
[time=1632] My privilege to introduce to you Jim Godwin who will be speaking in just a moment. Jim was a friend of mine on the West Coast and was at Western Baptist College and then went to First Baptist Church of Richland, Washington as the pastor.
[time=1643] And one of his associates was Ken Nichols. Ken left Blackhawk and went to Richland and worked in the First Baptist Church there.
[time=1650] Presently, Jim Godwin is the assistant to the President at Grand Rapids Baptist College in seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[time=1657] Delighted to have him here at Blackhawk and we welcome him. Would you do that too as he comes to the pulpit?
[time=1664] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1671] Thank you, Brother Pete. I have to confess to you. I was a little surprised when he called and asked me if I would come and speak because he does know me and he has heard me preach.
[time=1680] But I thought that perhaps it was like something that I heard from Dr. Paul Tassle. Dr. Tassle was pastoring in Des Moines, Iowa for many years and in that church there was a retired pastor.
[time=1693] And that pastor would come every Sunday morning, every Sunday night, every Wednesday night. He was there whenever Dr. Tassle was preaching, heard every sermon that he had.
[time=1701] And when Dr. Tassle left there to become the national representative for the General Association of regular Baptist churches, whenever he would be back within 150 mile radius of Des Moines, this dear retired pastor would drive to hear him preach.
[time=1716] And one time Dr. Tassle was going to be about 100 miles from Des Moines, but it was a wintery night. It was snowing outside. It was quite a storm.
[time=1723] And he thought, well, tonight, this dear pastor who's now in his early 80s surely would not drive 100 miles through a snowstorm to hear me preach.
[time=1731] But when Dr. Tassle got up to speak, he looked out and there and about the fourth row was this dear pastor waving to him.
[time=1738] After the sermon, he went to him and he said to him, he said, "Brother," he said, "I am really surprised to see you here tonight."
[time=1744] He said, "You know, you've heard every sermon I've got, and why would you drive 100 miles through a snowstorm to hear me preach?"
[time=1751] And this dear pastor thought for a minute and got a little twinkle in his eye.
[time=1755] And he said, "Well, Brother Paul," he said, "When I was in seminary years ago, one of my professors said that in every pastor there was at least one good sermon, and I just wanted to be there in case this was the night that you've reached it."
[time=1768] So maybe Pete Koby is hoping that this is the time that I've reached it.
[time=1776] If you have your Bibles, I'm going to ask if you turn to 1 Samuel, chapter 17.
[time=1782] And while you're turning, may I just take a moment to greet you from our President, Dr. Welch, at Grand Rapids Baptist College in seminary.
[time=1791] God has been blessing our school. We have between 900 and 1,000 students in the four-year college and seminary.
[time=1800] The college is a Christian liberal arts school. We offer degrees in all kinds of things.
[time=1805] We have a teacher's certification with the State of Michigan.
[time=1809] We also offer business degrees and music degrees, these different areas.
[time=1815] We also have Bible missions.
[time=1817] God has blessed us. We are now able through our seminary to offer a Doctor of Ministries program.
[time=1823] And also in our college, we're offering a pre-law. We're offering social work. Those interested in youth ministries.
[time=1830] These are all new programs at the school. We ask you to continue to pray for us, and we thank you for your prayers and support in the past.
[time=1837] Beloved, we are living in a day when there is a great emphasis being placed on this matter of being successful.
[time=1844] There are a lot of seminars on the subject of success. A lot of books being written about it.
[time=1850] Some of you who may be into that have read recently too long ago a book by David Lewis entitled The Secret Language of Success.
[time=1858] Another book by Napoleon Hill on success through positive mental attitude.
[time=1864] There are even books like John T. Malloy's book that will teach you how to dress for success.
[time=1869] Great emphasis being placed upon it.
[time=1872] But I want you to know that I believe with all my heart that the greatest book that has ever been written on the subject of success is the Bible.
[time=1879] God is concerned about his people being successful.
[time=1884] Now maybe not as the world would look at it, but as God looks at it, what real success is all about.
[time=1890] In fact, back in the Old Testament in Joshua chapter 1 verse 8, God said to Joshua that this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth.
[time=1900] But the thalmeest, really meditate upon it day and night that thou mayest observe to do all that is written therein.
[time=1907] Then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success.
[time=1912] Good success. God wants his people to be successful.
[time=1917] Now I realize that most of you don't know me, and I'm going to let you in on a little secret about myself and my wife will vouch for it.
[time=1924] I hate to lose.
[time=1928] I don't care what it is, ping pong, whatever it is, I hate to lose.
[time=1933] I have to confess to you, I drive that way too.
[time=1936] I hate to lose getting to that intersection or whatever it is, and I have to work at that.
[time=1942] I agree with the fellow who said coming in second is like kissing your sister, there's no thrill in it at all.
[time=1953] But I'll also let you in on this secret, if you haven't learned by now, success doesn't just happen, you have to work at it.
[time=1959] Someone said that being successful is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration, you have to work at it.
[time=1967] Someone else wrote that it's like the secret of success is like being like a duck on the water, calm and smooth and unruffled on top, but paddling like crazy underneath.
[time=1979] You have to work at it.
[time=1981] This morning I want to talk to you about seven principles of success, and I hope you have a pencil and some paper, you can take some notes down and jot these seven down.
[time=1988] Because surely you'll forget them if you don't.
[time=1991] Seven principles of success that are found here in first Samuel chapter 17, it's a very familiar story.
[time=1997] It's a story of David and Goliath.
[time=1999] But I trust that the familiarity of the story will not detract from your ability to grasp the tremendous truths that are found here in.
[time=2007] The first principle of success that I find is the principle of what we might call a particular purpose.
[time=2016] David had a particular purpose.
[time=2020] Now again, the story, as I've said, is familiar, and most of you know it very, very well.
[time=2026] The nation of Israel is gathered at the Valley of Elah to do battle against the Philistines.
[time=2033] The Philistines have brought out a secret weapon.
[time=2036] He's a giant, over nine and a half feet tall.
[time=2039] His name is Goliath, and Goliath in morning and in the evening would come out and usher a threat and a challenge to the people of Israel.
[time=2048] And he said, "Send out your champion. Send out your best fighter. Let him take me on.
[time=2053] And if he wins, we'll lay down our arms. But if I win, you lay down your arms."
[time=2059] And of course, no one in the nation of Israel felt as though they could take him on.
[time=2063] None of them would do it. And for 40 days and 40 nights, he had been coming out, ushering this threat, and nothing was taking place.
[time=2073] Now, according to verse 13 of chapter 17, David had three brothers who were involved in the war.
[time=2078] They were on Israel's side. Their names were alive of Benadab and Shema.
[time=2082] And David's father, Jesse, wanted to hear how things were going at the war, and so he put together some cheese and bread, and he called David in.
[time=2089] David was just a teenage boy. He said to him, "David, I want you to take these to your brother, and I want you to come back and tell me how things are going at the battle."
[time=2096] They didn't have the evening news with Dan Rather or Tom Brokaw or something, and this was the only way they could find out how things were happening.
[time=2103] So David, very excited about it. I'm sure as a teenager, took these items of food and made his way to the battle, and I imagine he expected to see all kinds of things taking place.
[time=2114] But when he got there, all was quiet, and he, of course, didn't know much about battles. He thought maybe this was a tea time or something, you know.
[time=2123] And here were the Philistines and the Israelites, and nobody was doing anything, and then Goliath came out and issued his threat.
[time=2130] And I imagine that David was excited to see which one of his brothers was going to come first, and nobody came.
[time=2136] So he went around over there and found where his brothers were staying and knocked on their tent, and flat, flat, flat.
[time=2143] I don't know how you knock on a tent, but anyway, you knock on the tent.
[time=2146] And Lyab came to the door and, "Oh, little bro, how you doing?" And they had a great talk, and then David said, "Hey, listen, did you happen to hear the Jolly Green Giant out there sound off with?"
[time=2154] And yes, we hear it every day, every morning, every night, we've heard it.
[time=2158] Well, why don't you go do something about it?
[time=2160] And of course the Lyab, he said, "Well, you know, I've got a back problem." And another one had athletes feed or something else.
[time=2167] I don't know what their problems were, but none of them wanted to go fight.
[time=2171] By the way, in verse 25, King Saul had even offered a special reward for anybody that would go out.
[time=2177] Look at verse 25. He said, "Three things I'll give if anybody will go out and fight and win."
[time=2183] Three things, number one, I'll give them great riches, great riches. Number two, I'll give them my daughter's hand in marriage, and number three, your house will be free.
[time=2193] I think that means it'll be free of taxes.
[time=2196] Now, who wouldn't like to have great riches? Great riches, that sounds wonderful.
[time=2200] Who wouldn't like to have your house free of taxes, especially if you live in Michigan?
[time=2205] I don't know what they do with all that tax money, they sure don't put it in the roads, but anyway, if you'd like to have great riches and you'd like to have your house free of taxes, it does kind of make you wonder what she looked like, doesn't it?
[time=2219] She must have been a real bowel. I don't know, but anyway.
[time=2223] That's just my sense of humor. You'll have to forgive me.
[time=2230] David, he really challenged them. He said, "Fellas, this isn't right. Look." Verse 26, the last part of it says, "For who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[time=2241] that he should defy the armies of the living God?" David says, "Wait a minute, fellas. What's this all about?"
[time=2251] Now, folks, I've got to tell you something, and you might as well jot this down, if you're going to be successful, if you're going to take a stand like David was doing, you're going to embarrass some people, because there's some people who aren't taking a stand and aren't doing what they ought to do just like a lyab, and a lyab was upset about it when David challenged him that way, and a lyab started questioning David's motives as you read on in verse 27 and 28. A lyab, his eldest brother, heard when he spoke unto the men, and a lyab's anger was kindled against David and said, "Why come a style down here?" And with whom has thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? Can't you just see it? He's challenging him, questioning his motives, questioning his pride.
[time=2291] And David's answer to him was a classic. In verse 29, and you ought to maybe even underline this in your Bible, David said, "What have I now done?
[time=2299] Is there not a cause?" Out alongside my Bible at that point, I have said, "Is there not a particular purpose for which we're fighting?" Folks, I've got to tell you something, if you're ever going to be successful in this life, you have got to learn, number one, what you're fighting about? What you're fighting for? We are in a battle, God tells us.
[time=2325] And we ought to know what the battle's about, and we ought to know what we are here for, what we are to do. Spurgeon said it in his Baptist catechism that we are to glorify God and to love him forever.
[time=2337] Our purpose is to glorify him, and David saw that the nation of Israel was not glorifying God. The testimony of Almighty God was on the line here.
[time=2349] There are those who've left the church and left this country and gone off the foreign places to serve as missionaries and in only a year or two have come home defeated. Why?
[time=2357] Because they never understood what they were really fighting for.
[time=2361] They never had a particular purpose, and when things got a little rough, they quit.
[time=2367] They quit. Oh, may God help us to have a particular purpose. The president of Columbia University once said that there are three kinds of people in the world there, those who make things happen, those who watch things happen and those who don't even know what's happening. And unfortunately there are a lot of Christians who don't know what's happening, and a lot of them sitting around watching things happen, and very few of them who are really making things happen for God, really being successful. And if you don't know what your purpose is, you will never be successful. Number two, there's a second principle.
[time=2399] David recognized previous preparation.
[time=2407] Now in verse 31, it says in the words were heard which David spoke, they reported them to Saul. They said, "Hey Saul, did you hear that there's a guy running around here in the camp saying that he could take on Goliath and defeat him?" Saul said, "Bring him to me. Which one of my men is it?" You can imagine his surprise when this teenage boy was brought before him. And David said to Saul, and if you'll forgive my own particular paraphrase, of verse 32, he said, "King, don't have a coronary. I'll take care of it." Just relax, King. Don't get yourself all worked up about it. Don't let your heart failure.
[time=2439] I'll take care of it. And Saul looked at David in verse 33 and said, "Thou aren't not able to go against the Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth. What was Saul doing?" Saul was looking on the outward appearance instead of upon the heart. So often we have a tendency to do that, don't we?
[time=2459] But David's answer to Saul, starting in verse 34, is tremendous.
[time=2465] He said, "Saul, let me tell you a story. You like a story? Let me tell you a story.
[time=2469] When I was back home doing the little insignificant things of life, just taking care of the sheep, one day a bear and a lion came out and took one of the little lambs." And so knowing that my job was to take care of the sheep, including the little lambs, I went after them. Verse 35, he says, "And I smote them." Why don't you love that word? Smote them. That's a good King James word. It means I punched their lights out.
[time=2499] And you know what? They got a little upset about it and they came after me and so I smote them again. In fact, he said I slew them. I killed them. Killed the bear and a lion. Now what is he saying? Why is he telling him the story?
[time=2511] He is recognizing previous preparation that God allowed him to go through so that he would be ready for this war and he tells him so. He says, "Look, if I can take on the bear and the lion and kill them, I won't have any trouble with this Philistine who has a glandular problem." It's no problem.
[time=2527] I can take care of it. I can do it.
[time=2531] Recognizing previous preparation. But why? Listen to me, because he was faithful in the little things.
[time=2539] Beloved, we need to have some Sunday school teachers who will be faithful in the little things.
[time=2547] Some nursery workers. Some choir members.
[time=2553] Because you see, you don't know, but what that faithfulness in that task may be the preparation for some future big task that God still has for you.
[time=2561] And if you're not faithful there, you won't know that you can take on the big thing.
[time=2565] If David had been like a lot of Christians, when that bear and lion came out and they didn't happen to have a .357 magnum handy with them, only a rock and a snot, they would have said goodbye little lamb, you know?
[time=2577] But not David. What does Paul say over in 1 Corinthians 4-2? Moreover,
[time=2583] it is required of a steward that a man be found faithful.
[time=2587] Jesus said, "You be faithful in the little things and I'll make your ruler over many."
[time=2593] Oh, the importance of previous preparation.
[time=2599] Well, there's a third principle.
[time=2603] David had a proper perspective. He had a proper perspective.
[time=2607] Look at verse 37. Just in case you think that David was going to take all the glory and the credit for beating up on the lion and the bear, he immediately said, "The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistine." See, at a proper perspective, he knew that it was God that did it and he never forgot that God did it.
[time=2629] That's an important lesson to learn, folks. I'll never forget when I was at Western Baptist College as a student way back in 1961, and that year I was playing the piano for a quartet and they decided to send us out on the road during the summer for eight weeks and every night we would have a different meeting and different concert and one of us would have to preach.
[time=2648] And they said, "All of you are going to have to take turns preaching." And I said, "Well, I play the piano. I don't preach." They said, "No, you've got to preach." So I had to work up a sermon and I had to preach it in front of the president and get his approval and then they sent us out.
[time=2662] Now, folks, I knew when my turn was going to come, my first turn, I was going to be in Missoula, Montana, a little church in Missoula, Montana.
[time=2669] You don't know how I prayed. I prayed that no one would show up.
[time=2673] I prayed the raptured come. I prayed everything would happen before I'd have to preach that sermon.
[time=2677] But I prayed God. I said, "If we get through this thing, it's going to have to be all of you because I'm scared to death. I don't know how you feel about it, God, but that's the way I'm feeling right now." And I got up and I preached my sermon, gave the invitation, and there must have been 50 people that came and got right with God that night.
[time=2691] Well, you know what? That was the worst thing in the world that could happen to me.
[time=2696] Because when I went home that night, I thought, "Well, I don't have to pray anymore.
[time=2701] I got it made. Move over, Moody. I'm here." I got hardly wait till it was the next time to preach. It was in Ferndale, Washington.
[time=2714] And I got up and I preached my sermon and I gave the invitation and nobody came.
[time=2719] There was a little red-headed kid sitting on the front row, tried to scare him into coming. He didn't care.
[time=2724] And I went home and I got down by my bed at the back of the motel and I began to pray and I said,
[time=2730] "God, thank you. I've learned a lesson. It's not me. It's you. It's all of you, or it's never going to work."
[time=2738] Proper perspective.
[time=2742] If the children of Israel had learned that, when they sent those 12 spies into the land to spy out, 10 of them came back and they said, "What?" They said, "There's giants in the land. Look at all the problems.
[time=2750] Wow, there's giants. We can't do it." Only two of them had a proper perspective. They said, "Yeah, we saw the problems. We saw the giants." But we also looked up and saw God. God's still on the throne. God can handle it.
[time=2765] But unfortunately, the people voted no.
[time=2768] And all those 20 years of age and older died in that wilderness because of their lack of faith.
[time=2773] They had a wrong perspective. There's a fourth thing. Not only is there a particular purpose and a previous preparation and a proper perspective, but number four, David had personal protection.
[time=2785] Personal protection. I want you to see what I mean by that. Look at verse 38.
[time=2791] By the way, verse 37, let me finish with that. The last part of verse 37 says, "And Saul said to David
[time=2798] after hearing the story about the bear and the lion." And so forth, he said, "Well, that's great.
[time=2802] Go and the Lord be with thee." Now, doesn't that sound spiritual? Go and the Lord be with thee.
[time=2808] But then he proved that he really didn't believe God could do it because in verse 38, Saul then gave David his armor.
[time=2814] He said, "Here, you're going to need some help. Let me give you my armor, my sword." Boy, put this all on.
[time=2818] And remember, Saul was head and shoulders above the rest of the Israelites. He was a tall man.
[time=2822] David was just a teenager and David found out something in a hurry. David found out that he wasn't Saul.
[time=2827] Are you listening to me? David wasn't Saul.
[time=2832] And it wouldn't have worked for him to try to be Saul. David had the same kind of personal protection that Saul had because he works the same God.
[time=2842] The same God that could protect Saul could protect David, but he didn't have to do it the same way.
[time=2847] You ever tried to be somebody else?
[time=2850] You ever tried to teach like somebody else or sing like somebody else or whatever?
[time=2856] Folks, we've got to come to grips with the fact that God made us the way he made us for a particular purpose.
[time=2862] And God can use us. We don't have to do it the way somebody else did it.
[time=2869] Personal protection.
[time=2873] And if you'll forgive me, I've got to throw in just a little side thought here.
[time=2878] Can you imagine what it was like? This is my sanctified imagination.
[time=2882] Can you imagine what it was like when David walked out of Saul's tent without the armor of Saul without the sword?
[time=2888] He walked out and his brothers met him out there and they said, "Where are you going, David?" David said, "Well, I'm going to go fight Goliath." "Well, where's your sword?" "Well, I don't have a sword." "Well, where's your armor?" "Well, I don't have any armor." "Well, how are you going to kill Goliath?" "Well, I'm going to throw a stone at him."
[time=2909] "Well, I'm going to throw a rock at him." Now, I don't know that this happened, but I just can't believe that somebody didn't take the opportunity to say, "David, we've never done it that way before." See, I've been around a lot of Baptist churches, and I know.
[time=2929] We've never done it that way before, but David did it his way, and he was successful.
[time=2934] Number five, fifth principle, David had a precise plan, a precise plan.
[time=2942] Verse 40 says that David went to the brook and he picked out five stones.
[time=2945] Why did he pick out five? Well, we don't know for sure, but it's possible that David knew what we know
[time=2951] based on 1st Samuel, or 2nd Samuel, chapter 21.
[time=2954] Goliath had four sons, and they were all men of war.
[time=2958] And David thought, "Well, if I kill Dad, it's very possible that the four sons may come out." They'd be a little upset about it, so I'm going to take five with me, but he had a plan, a precise plan,
[time=2968] and he went to carry out that particular plan. He went down and he waited for the giant.
[time=2972] "You, Mr. Giant." And the Bible says in verse 42 that when Goliath saw him, he looked on David with disdain, with disgust,
[time=2983] and he said to him in verse 44, "Kid, you better go home, or I'm going to feed you to the buzzards."
[time=2989] And all the time David just sat there playing with his little slingshot, singing to himself, rock of age, or something like that. I don't know what he said, but he had his plan.
[time=2998] The point I'm trying to make folks is it is important, it is imperative.
[time=3002] If you're going to be successful, you must have a plan.
[time=3006] Do you have any goals in life?
[time=3011] When I was pastoring out in the state of Washington, occasionally I would get invited to go to different churches that were without pastors, or pastors were inviting me to come because their churches were having some problems, and they needed some help, and we would go and we'd sit down with the board of deacons.
[time=3027] Sometimes the board of trustees would also be there if they had one.
[time=3031] And I would say to them this, I'd say, "Tell me something, just out of curiosity, what are your plans for the church?
[time=3037] What are your goals for your church in the next five, ten, fifteen, twenty years?" You can't believe the silence.
[time=3045] They all looked at one another, shuffled their feet, looked at the floor.
[time=3049] Finally, maybe one of them would say something like this, "Well, we hope to still be here." And that was their plan.
[time=3056] No wonder the churches aren't growing. No wonder nothing's happening.
[time=3061] But the same thing is true in our own individual life.
[time=3063] Do you have a goal, a plan for your life, spiritual plans, plans for your family, how they can grow?
[time=3071] Financial plans. What kind of plans do you have?
[time=3078] You know, when God called Nehemiah to go back and rebuild the walls, he told him what to do, but he didn't tell him how to do it.
[time=3083] He left the planning up to Nehemiah, and Nehemiah came up with a good plan.
[time=3087] He just simply got everybody around in a circle where the wall was to be, and he said, "Now you live right there, you build the wall right where you live."
[time=3094] And remember this, the enemy comes through it, the weakest part of the wall, so build your wall strong.
[time=3100] And they did. It was a good plan.
[time=3103] Do you have a plan?
[time=3104] Nelleton, a great French surgeon, said, "If I have only four minutes to perform an operation, I will spend at least 40 minutes in the planning of it."
[time=3113] Planning, a precise plan.
[time=3116] Let me give you a sixth principle.
[time=3118] The sixth principle is that David had prevailing power, prevailing power in verses 45 through 50.
[time=3126] In other words, he was victorious. He prevailed over Goliath. He won the battle.
[time=3131] But again, where did he get that power?
[time=3133] Verse 45, he said to Goliath, "I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts."
[time=3141] He got that power from God, and in that power he stood.
[time=3144] And as Goliath approached, David let go with one of those stones, and it found its mark right in the center of his forehead.
[time=3151] Folks, that wasn't an accident. David knew what he was aiming for, and he was a good shot.
[time=3156] He practiced long and hard. He intended to rock Goliath to sleep, and he did.
[time=3161] And then he went up, took out Goliath's sword, and cut his head off.
[time=3166] And when Goliath was defeated, actually he was deheaded, but same principle, when he was defeated.
[time=3174] Oh, that's bad. I'm sorry.
[time=3181] Anyway, I just wanted to see if you're still awake. When that happened, it is interesting to know what took place.
[time=3189] Suddenly the Philistines took off running in fear, and do you know what happened to the Israelites?
[time=3195] They suddenly got great courage. They got over their back problems in their athletes' feet and everything else,
[time=3201] and they came running after the Philistines, and they defeated them.
[time=3204] What I'm trying to say is that when you are successful, it is amazing how many people you can help and encourage to be successful also.
[time=3214] People like to follow winners. To follow success.
[time=3220] Well, I said there were seven. Let me give you the seventh one.
[time=3225] David gave prompt praise.
[time=3229] Prompt praise. Oh, this is important. Look at verse 46.
[time=3234] Verse 46, as David said before Goliath, he said, "This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee, and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day, unto the fowls of the year, and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
[time=3250] And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear, for the battle is the Lord's,
[time=3256] and He will give you into our hands."
[time=3262] He wanted Goliath to know that God was going to get the praise for this victory.
[time=3267] And folks, it is so important that we learn that whenever we experience any success in life that it is from God and God gets the praise.
[time=3276] You start taking the credit for yourself, and you're in trouble. It's a principle of success, to God be all the glory.
[time=3283] He gets the praise for everything that's done.
[time=3289] Remember when Elijah was on Mount Carmel?
[time=3292] He was involved with this contest between the prophets of Baal as to who was God, whether Baal was God or whether Jehovah was God.
[time=3299] And Israel, they were so far away from God, they weren't even sure if there was a God, and they didn't know.
[time=3304] Was Baal, God, was Jehovah, God? Who was the real God?
[time=3307] And so they had a contest, and whoever the real God was, was going to send fire down out of heaven to consume their particular sacrifice.
[time=3314] And after the worshipers of Baal had danced around and tried everything they could, and nothing happened, Elijah had them pour water after water after water on his sacrifice just to see that there was no trick.
[time=3325] And then he knelt, and he prayed, and he said, "Hear me, O Lord, hear me." Why? So that I can get the credit, no.
[time=3333] That this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and the fire fell.
[time=3341] And the Bible says that the whole nation of Israel fell down on their faces and began to cry out, "The Lord, He is God.
[time=3348] The Lord, He is God, and God got the praise." And that is what is so desperately needed in these principles of success.
[time=3359] As I close this morning, I'd like to read you something, just a couple of short paragraphs from an article by Chuck Swindall in one of his books.
[time=3367] It's a little daily meditation, and he was writing on the life of David.
[time=3373] It's called "The Shadow of the Giant." He says this, "Are you facing a giant? Chances are you've already bumped into one or more this week.
[time=3384] Is the intimidation reaching unbearable proportions? Do your ears ache from their constant threats? Don't run.
[time=3394] Don't try a bigger club either. Be like David. Turn your goliath over to Jehovah, the giant killer.
[time=3403] Explain to your powerful God how anxious you are for him to win this victory for a change.
[time=3409] Then Chuck Swindall says, "Then load up your sling, and don't forget the stones, because you're in for the time of your life.
[time=3420] Walk with God. Let's bow together in prayer."
[time=3429] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the privilege that we have of serving you.
[time=3437] Father, we know that it is your desire that we be successful.
[time=3440] We pray that we might learn from some of these principles out of David's life and apply them to our life.
[time=3447] The one of the world would look at us and call us successful.
[time=3451] The most important thing is we stand before you, and throughout all eternity we know that you've said well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joys, the blessings of your inheritance.
[time=3465] Our Father, we would pray if there's one person here this morning who's never come to know Christ as Savior, they would receive Him this day. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3477] We've been sharing with you today music from our Sanctuary Choir, a duet from Jenny Crawford and Jenny Clancy,
[time=3496] and a solo from Reed LaFavor. The message today was from our special guest, Jim Godwin, who is Assistant to the President at Grand Rapids Baptist College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
[time=3506] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I want to pray this prayer with you. Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3515] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3522] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3535] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3539] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started
[time=3545] in your spiritual walk with God.
