[time=114] From the perspective of the world, J. Paul Getty was a very wise man.
[time=118] He had everything, money, fame, a multinational corporation which he owned.
[time=123] Yet his son has written about his dad that his father was seldom home.
[time=128] His father was rarely around.
[time=130] One day the young Getty wrote a letter to his father sharing some of his personal feelings.
[time=136] It wasn't long before the letter was returned in the mail.
[time=139] There was no personal note, not even one line from his father.
[time=142] His father had merely corrected his spelling errors and his grammatical mistakes and sent the letter back to him.
[time=149] From the perspective of the world, J. Paul Getty was a wise man.
[time=154] But Godly wisdom says that a father sows love and warmth and acceptance and all of those important things into the life of his son.
[time=163] Is there a difference between worldly wisdom and Godly wisdom?
[time=167] Yes, there is.
[time=168] Come with us this morning as we study the subject.

[time=1539] O God, my Father, my Father.
[time=1559] O God, my Father.
[time=2007] I want us to see three attributes of godly wisdom, three attributes of godly wisdom that will help us to discern between the wisdom of the world that comes at us every day and the true wisdom of God that he gives us through his holy word.
[time=2024] And then in a few moments at the end briefly, I want to talk about a biblical formula for acquiring wisdom in our lives.
[time=2032] Well, let's look at this text as we go through the text today.
[time=2036] Who is wise in understanding among you, verse 13, let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
[time=2046] But if you harbor envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
[time=2052] Such wisdom, such wisdom does not come down from heaven, but is earthly, unspiritual of the devil.
[time=2061] Where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every practice.
[time=2067] But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure, then peace loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
[time=2077] Peace makers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.
[time=2082] The first attribute of Godly wisdom that I would like us to see today is found in verse 13, and that is Godly wisdom is humble.
[time=2091] Godly wisdom is humble. Let's look at that verse again.
[time=2096] He says, "Who is wise in understanding among you, let him show it by his good life, by deeds done, how in the humility that comes from wisdom."
[time=2109] The truly wise man in the way of Godly wisdom is not just a man who has great knowledge.
[time=2116] It's not just a man who has great knowledge, but it's the man who takes the wisdom of God and applies it to his daily life.
[time=2125] But as a result of that wisdom, humility is characteristic of his daily life.
[time=2132] Let's look at some of the words that Art mentioned here.
[time=2135] First of all, notice in verse 13, he puts it in the form of a question, "Who is wise in understanding among you?"
[time=2141] James did that for a reason. It gives that question conditional force.
[time=2146] The idea there is, "Who is wise in understanding among you?" It is the person who acts it out in his daily life.
[time=2154] It is the person who lives humbly before men. That is the wise person in the eyes of God, the one who has humility.
[time=2163] That word "wise" there, that's from the Greek word "sofos", that means the ability to perceive the true nature of things.
[time=2173] It's the idea of having great moral insight and being able to take that insight and apply it to daily life.
[time=2182] A person who is wise has this ability, and secondly it says he has understanding.
[time=2190] That word means expert knowledge. It means that he has a tremendous knowledge of a certain area of his life.
[time=2197] What is James telling us very plainly? He's saying, "The man who is truly wise is the man who has a practical ability to take the knowledge that he has and apply it to his life,
[time=2209] but he also tells us that it's a person who has taken the time to acquire great knowledge, in this case as a believer,
[time=2217] knowledge of the word of God and the precepts that God has given us for our daily life.
[time=2223] That person is wise and understanding. Then notice as he says what happens.
[time=2229] As a result of that, let him show it by his good life, by deeds.
[time=2235] The word "good" can also be translated "beautiful".
[time=2239] The idea there is that of an attractive person.
[time=2242] James is saying, "Let the person who is truly wise live a beautiful, wonderful, lovely life in front of other people.
[time=2252] Let his wisdom be manifested in the beauty of his lifestyle.
[time=2257] That other people will see it in him. We'll look at him and we'll see the wisdom manifested in his daily life.
[time=2266] Good deeds, godly deeds, beautiful deeds, but most importantly notice that it says that those deeds will be done
[time=2274] how in the humility and how do we get that humility? The humility that comes as a result of the wisdom.
[time=2284] The humility is a byproduct of the wisdom as we acquire it from God almighty and from his word.
[time=2292] But done in the humility that comes from wisdom. Now we need to take a look at that word there.
[time=2297] Humility or meekness in some of the other versions, gentleness.
[time=2301] The idea there is not of weakness.
[time=2304] It's not of somebody who's namby pamby, spineless, somebody who's just a doormat, easily pushed aside.
[time=2311] That is as far from a definition of that word humble as you could possibly be.
[time=2316] The word there comes from a word that was used to describe strong, powerful horses that had been broken
[time=2324] and had been put inside a bridle and were now under control.
[time=2329] So what is James telling us? He is saying the humble Christian, the humble man or woman who is wise,
[time=2336] is the one who is strong and powerful, but it is a strength that has been broken by God
[time=2342] and has been submitted to the bridle of the Holy Spirit seeking to walk in the control of the Holy Spirit-filled life.
[time=2352] And that is the idea of a humble man. Strength but strength under control, not arrogance, not contentiousness,
[time=2362] not someone who promotes themselves over other people, not someone who tries to accomplish their ends no matter what.
[time=2370] Oh no, that's not what a humble person is. A humble person is a wise man.
[time=2376] And God says if we are wise today, that wisdom will evidence itself in our lives by works done in humility.
[time=2385] Our lives will be beautiful. Well there was a great preacher of another era. His name was Harry Ironsides.
[time=2392] Harry Ironsides was a great preacher and a great prolific Christian writer.
[time=2397] And as his ministry grew in the city of Chicago, his fame spread until finally he was known throughout the evangelical world
[time=2404] for his great wisdom and knowledge and preaching.
[time=2408] Well Harry Ironsides became concerned that he was losing his humility, that indeed pride was sneaking in and causing him some problems.
[time=2417] And so he went to one of his best friends and he said, "What should I do to prove to God that I am a humble man?
[time=2423] What can I do to humble myself to show God that I want to be humble?" His friend looked at him and said, "Harry, this is what I do. I go and get a sandwich board like they used to have back then.
[time=2435] Get a sandwich board and write on both sides of it the plan of salvation.
[time=2439] And then take that sandwich board, put it over yourself and walk around the streets of Chicago for an entire day.
[time=2446] That'll show that you're humble." Well Ironsides did just that. Walk through the streets of Chicago with this sandwich board with the plan of salvation on it.
[time=2456] People taunted him, people teased him, but he took it. Walked him through the streets of Chicago.
[time=2462] But as Ironsides finished the day and came back to his apartment, he said he realized that the battle between pride and humility in his life would never end.
[time=2471] For he said as he closed the door of his apartment, the first thing he said to himself was this, Ironsides, "I'll bet you there's not another person in Chicago who'd be humble enough to do today what you did."
[time=2484] He realized it would be a lifelong battle. But the godly man, the wise man, is a humble man.
[time=2492] Or you humble today. Humbleness is not arrogance. The wisdom of the world says, "Get ahead. Win at any cost.
[time=2502] He who dies with the most toys wins." But God's wisdom says, "Do it my way. Don't be arrogant. Oh, it's good to be successful, but be successful by following the wisdom of God Almighty."
[time=2516] Let's move on to the second point today. And that is found in verses 14 to 16. And that is that godly wisdom is not destructive.
[time=2524] Godly wisdom is not destructive. Look at verses 14 to 16. But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
[time=2536] Notice verse 15, "For such wisdom does not come down from heaven, but is earthly, unspiritual, and of the devil. For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every practice."
[time=2553] James says that the wisdom of the world destroys. The wisdom of the world causes chaos, disharmony, and destroyed people in its path and leads to every evil practice, but godly wisdom is not destructive.
[time=2569] For he says in verse 15 that such wisdom does not come from heaven, the type of wisdom that destroys. Earthly wisdom can lead to destruction. Godly wisdom, we will find in a few moments, leads to peace.
[time=2584] But let's take a look at the effect that earthly wisdom can have in these verses, and then we'll see how godly wisdom accomplishes just the opposite.
[time=2594] If you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, the idea there of bitter envy is the idea of selfish jealousy. It's the idea of a deep, discontented, raging jealousy that says, "If you have something that I don't, I want it so bad, I'm going to take it away from you if I can get it."
[time=2614] It's a raging jealousy that cuts down other people. In fact, that word bitter in Greek means exactly that, to cut down. It's the idea of cutting down someone else, attempting to destroy them with a raging jealousy.
[time=2629] And then he goes on to say not just that, but also bitter envy and selfish ambition, the idea of walking upon somebody else in order to promote ourselves, the idea of not caring who we hurt or who we destroy as long as we succeed in getting what we want in this life.
[time=2649] Worldly wisdom teaches many times, as we look at it, that that's the type of life that's acceptable to lead.
[time=2656] James says here that that's not godly wisdom, that's not the wisdom that comes down from above, but where does it come from?
[time=2664] Let's look at that. He says it comes first of all. It is earthly. It comes from earth. It comes from man.
[time=2672] He is saying there that worldly wisdom, first of all, is philosophy. It is wisdom that we receive into our being as a result of the secular philosophies of the society in which we live.
[time=2687] They are philosophies. They are wisdom that are often ungodly. And he is saying that they cause chaos in our life.
[time=2697] Now what would be some examples of those? Basically, earthly wisdom might be the idea that we have in our society, that you are what you have.
[time=2704] Your standing in our society depends upon how much you own of this world's goods.
[time=2710] But you know that God's word teaches that he's not a respecter of persons. Another example of godly philosophy would be that you are how much you make, who you are and who you are in society's eyes is based upon the size of your paycheck each week and how other people treat you.
[time=2728] Well, that's earthly wisdom. That's not godly wisdom. We're influenced by it every day. We're exposed to it by books, by TV, by movies, by the people that we work with, wherever it might be, we are exposed to earthly wisdom.
[time=2744] He says that's not godly wisdom, but it can influence us. Another example of earthly wisdom would be a saying that's kind of popular in our society today and dealing with other people.
[time=2755] You can apologize to somebody and they say to themselves, "Well, I'll forgive, but I know I'm never going to forget."
[time=2764] The idea there is that they say they'll forgive, but the idea of holding a grudge or getting even is always there, and that's not true forgiveness.
[time=2772] Godly wisdom says that we are to forgive and to forget, we are to forgive how often? 70 times 7.
[time=2780] Worldly wisdom teaches often wisdom contrary to the precepts of godly wisdom. Then he says other wisdom is unspiritual.
[time=2789] That means wisdom that we take in through our senses. That means wisdom that we receive from the world through our senses. We see it, we hear it.
[time=2799] And this is the type of wisdom that is unspiritual. It's the type of wisdom that says if it feels good, do it.
[time=2807] If that's what you want to do, no matter what do it, if it feels good, do it.
[time=2813] That's so prevalent in our society today, and we see the amount of families being destroyed, the amount of children and wives and husbands being destroyed by extramarital affairs, the amount of young people being destroyed by premarital sexual relationships.
[time=2828] Oh godly wisdom says we're not to commit for an occasion. Godly wisdom says we're not to commit adultery.
[time=2835] Why does it say that? Because God knew that his wisdom was best.
[time=2840] And the wisdom that comes from above says that when you do those things, you sow chaos in your life and in the lives of others.
[time=2847] You sow destruction, and that's not the way it's to be.
[time=2851] Earthly wisdom, unspiritual wisdom. Lastly he says evil or that of the devil.
[time=2859] The idea there is that of demonic or something inspired by the occult.
[time=2864] The idea of the fact that people in our society today seek wisdom, where? From horoscopes, from tarot cards, from Ouija boards.
[time=2873] Some are seeking it through the new age movement, which is nothing new at all. It's just old age Eastern mysticism is all it is.
[time=2880] They seek wisdom from the occult, but James says that's not the wisdom that comes from above.
[time=2888] For the wisdom from above does not destroy, but the wisdom that comes from earth causes destruction and results in the destruction of many lives.
[time=2898] It's the result of pursuing the wrong type of wisdom.
[time=2903] Well, you probably have heard about a man by the name of J. Paul Getty.
[time=2908] He's passed away now, but in his day J. Paul Getty was much admired by the society in which he lived.
[time=2914] J. Paul Getty was one of the world's wealthiest men. In the eyes of the world he was wise.
[time=2920] He had acquired tremendous wealth. He had gotten millions and even billions of dollars.
[time=2926] He had built a tremendous multinational corporation. He was a worldwide celebrity, respected by the world, considered to be wise.
[time=2935] But J. Paul Getty Jr., his son, has written that when he was young, he rarely if ever saw his father.
[time=2943] In fact, his father was hardly ever around, and one day he writes in a book that he wanted to communicate some of his feelings to his father.
[time=2951] And so he wrote down some thoughts on a piece of paper and sent it as a letter to his father.
[time=2957] Short time later the letter came back in the mail. There was no personal note attached to it.
[time=2963] There was not even a line from his famous wealthy father. His father had merely taken the letter, corrected the grammatical mistakes and the spelling errors, and fired it right back to him.
[time=2975] J. Paul Getty Jr. has said many times, he's never gotten over that. Never gotten over that.
[time=2982] And his life has been filled with rejection and turmoil and torment because of the life that he led as a millionaire child growing up.
[time=2994] Worldly wisdom says, worldly wisdom says that you are wise when you show and leave your children an example of how to get ahead and how to succeed.
[time=3005] That's important. We're certainly not against success, not against success today.
[time=3011] But worldly wisdom says that's what counts, getting ahead, leaving that legacy of millions of dollars for your children so that they can then do the same thing as they follow your example.
[time=3021] But godly wisdom says that you're a wise man when you sow peace into your child's life and security and warmth and affection.
[time=3030] And you don't reject them, but you love them and give them all of those things that a child needs to be a properly nurtured child.
[time=3038] Believe that we have to go through each day. Take the wisdom that we implement into our decisions and problems.
[time=3046] Take it to the Word of God and challenge ourselves to see if it's godly wisdom.
[time=3051] Are we making the godly decision? Or have we been influenced by the wisdom of the world around us that wants us often to go a totally different way?
[time=3061] Well, let's move on to the third and final point.
[time=3064] And that is that godly wisdom is pure and peaceful. Godly wisdom is pure and peaceful. Look in verses 17 and 18.
[time=3073] But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure, then peace loving. Consider it submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
[time=3085] Peace makers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.
[time=3090] What he is saying here is that godly wisdom is the opposite of the types of wisdom that we have just mentioned.
[time=3098] Godly wisdom brings purity and peace into the life of a person.
[time=3103] Let's look at some of the terms that he used to describe the wisdom that comes from heaven.
[time=3108] He says it's first of all pure and so the pure person is one who is undefiled.
[time=3113] The pure person, the one who is truly wise, keeps himself pure. In fact, he shuns or shrinks from the very attraction of evil.
[time=3123] He runs from it that he may maintain the purity and keep his life, his body, from becoming polluted and destroyed.
[time=3132] He says that it's first of all pure. Secondly, it's peace loving.
[time=3136] That means it tries to resolve conflict, not stir it up.
[time=3140] Oh, that doesn't mean that we never have disagreements as friends.
[time=3144] It doesn't mean that we always agree with everything that our friends say and at times we disagree.
[time=3150] But it means that as godly wise people, we seek to solve those problems and resolve them in the love that God gives us.
[time=3159] We resolve conflict and seek to bring about peace in our life.
[time=3164] Thirdly, he says we are considerate. That means not harsh.
[time=3168] It means that when we teach or correct others, we do it gently, not harshly.
[time=3173] We don't destroy them, but we correct them by building them up at the same time.
[time=3179] He says that a man who is wise in the ways of God is considerate.
[time=3185] Then it says he's submissive.
[time=3187] That means we are submissive to our parents. We are submissive to those that are in authority over us.
[time=3193] It's important that we realize that point.
[time=3197] What doesn't mean that it's wrong to share our opinions and they will disagree with our bosses.
[time=3201] That we will disagree and to graciously share them or graciously share them with our parents.
[time=3207] But it says that we are to submit to the authority over us, whether it be our parents, the government or those with which we live, submissive, full of mercy.
[time=3217] That means kindness, reaching out and helping. Good fruit. That means the godly wise person will live a life which produces godly fruit in the lives of others.
[time=3227] Will sow into the lives of others goodness and build them up full of good fruit.
[time=3233] And then he goes on to say impartial and sincere.
[time=3237] Impartial means that we will not look at someone and judge them and like someone more than someone else.
[time=3245] We will not take advantage of someone while we treat somebody else differently.
[time=3250] God says that he is no respecter of persons and were to be impartial.
[time=3255] That last word there, sincere means without a hidden agenda.
[time=3260] It means that when we come to deal with people, we don't have our own agenda hidden that we're going to ram through if we can possibly get it.
[time=3267] We don't have selfish motives. We're sincere. What somebody sees is what they get in their relationships with us.
[time=3275] All of these attributes bring about purity and peace into our life and into the lives of others.
[time=3284] And we can test the wisdom that we use in life by looking at God's word and saying is what I'm doing bringing peace into someone's life.
[time=3292] Am I being considerate? Am I being impartial? Am I building somebody up? Am I reaching out and encouraging them?
[time=3299] And in times of disagreement, am I attempting to resolve the conflict or am I stalking off with a bad attitude and refusing to deal with that person?
[time=3308] God's word says the wise person brings peace.
[time=3312] He brings purity to his world.
[time=3316] Let me tell you a story about a boy named Teddy.
[time=3319] Teddy was a hard little boy to love. He was in the sixth grade. Teddy was not very well kept. His hair was out of place. His clothes were always dirty.
[time=3329] Oh, Teddy at times could be a tremendous behavior problem. But most of the time he just had a blank stare that stared out the window at school in the sixth grade classroom where he was.
[time=3339] Teddy wasn't very well liked by the other students. And Miss Thompson, his godly Christian teacher, admitted that even though she needed to be impartial and she said she loved everybody, there was just something about Teddy. She had a hard time loving.
[time=3354] In fact, she said that she even at times enjoyed marking an F on his paper when she saw that he hadn't done very well.
[time=3362] But it came that time of year for Christmas to come and the kids were all bringing their presence to the teacher.
[time=3368] And one by one, the kids came up and gave Miss Thompson their presence, beautifully wrapped with bows and beautiful gifts from the children.
[time=3376] Oh, they were so happy. And then Teddy came up to give his gift to Miss Thompson.
[time=3382] And Teddy's gift was wrapped in an old brown lunch bag. There was no ribbon on it. He just kind of handed it to Miss Thompson and everybody giggled and laughed.
[time=3391] Miss Thompson reached inside the bag. First of all, she pulled out an old rhinestone bracelet with half of the rhinestones missing.
[time=3400] Wasn't very attractive, but she saw the smile in Teddy's face and she put the rhinestone bracelet on and she wore it proudly and she held it up to the kids and she said, "Isn't this beautiful? What Teddy's brought me?"
[time=3412] And then she reached back inside the bag and pulled out a cheap bottle of perfume that smelled terrible, but she took a few drops and put it on her hand and splashed it on and told Teddy how much she appreciated the gift.
[time=3425] Well, when school was over that day, she looked up from her desk and there was Teddy. Teddy walked up to her and he said, "Miss Thompson, I just had to tell you. My mom's rhinestone bracelet sure looks good on you."
[time=3442] And when you wear that perfume, you smell just the way my mom used to smell. And Miss Thompson pulled Teddy's records out of her desk drawer one more time and she saw that Teddy wasn't a dumb young man.
[time=3456] Teddy had been a good student, but his mother had died in the third grade and he had gone through some tremendous trials and troubles ever since then.
[time=3464] Miss Thompson got down on her knees and asked God to forgive her and said, "Give me the godly wisdom to treat Teddy in the way that I should."
[time=3471] And the next day, when Teddy and the kids came, every child in her room was loved equally. And what she did was this. She sewed peace into Teddy's life.
[time=3482] She sewed encouragement into his life and built him up. She brought purity. She brought encouragement and she brought learning to a boy that nobody liked.
[time=3493] That's not the end of the story. Four years later, five or six years later, she got a letter from Teddy and said this, "Dear Miss Thompson, today I'm graduating second in my high school class. How about that?"
[time=3509] And then four years later, Miss Thompson got another letter from Teddy and this time it said, "Dear Miss Thompson, guess what? I'm graduating valedictorian in my college class."
[time=3521] We've been sharing with you music from our sanctuary choir, the Handbell Choir and soloist Brian Lowson. The message today was from our associate pastor, Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=3532] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3541] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that you sent your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3549] And today I know that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to forgive me of my sins and be my savior today. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3561] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
