[time=47] (bell ringing) After 23 years of marriage, my wife and I no longer sit
[time=74] in the same bucket seat while we're driving in the car.
[time=77] This morning I would like to address the issue of first love and talk about the difference in the changes that occur.

[time=464] [MUSIC - 283 seconds]
[time=752] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour Today.
[time=766] I love the scripture that says, I was glad when they came into the house of the Lord.
[time=771] I love to come to church and to listen to the glorious music that we have and the message from God's word.
[time=777] I hope as you watch through the Bible Hour that you are also inspired by our music and the message that we have on the Bible Hour.
[time=783] We're glad that you write from time to time and let us know that you're watching and that you're receiving a blessing.
[time=790] If you are watching in the Fort Wayne area, I'd like to tell you about a special event that's taking place tonight.
[time=795] We're going to have our own handbell choir give a concert here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 6 p.m.
[time=801] Our church is located at 7400 East State and that's right here in Fort Wayne, the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=807] We'd love to have you come.
[time=808] If you don't have a regular service in your church, come and join us for our handbell concert tonight at 6 p.m.
[time=816] Our special guest today is Dr. Carl Solvine.
[time=818] Good morning, Dr. Solvine.
[time=820] - Good morning.
[time=821] - I'm glad to have you here today.
[time=822] Dr. Solvine is a part of our own city and he is involved in individual and family counseling.
[time=830] Dr. Solvine, what are some of the major issues that you deal with and do you like to deal with and believe that through the Lord's help and your help, you can help people?
[time=839] - Well, I try to make a special emphasis on marriage and believing that marriages can be resolved.
[time=846] No matter how difficult the situation may be, I'm very anxious to try every avenue and not willing to give up easily.
[time=855] And I also do a lot with trying to help people get free from things that have happened in the past.
[time=863] To have a sense that God can set them free, they can go on with productive and meaningful lives as they move through the rest of their life.
[time=870] - Well, I know that even at the church here, we have so many people, even our own church, that have difficulties in their lives.
[time=876] And it's men like you that have dedicated your lives to the Lord and to gathering information and help that can assist these people in their marriages.
[time=885] And there is hope and we need to work at it.
[time=889] You're talking this morning about first love.
[time=891] Can you give us just a brief synopsis of what you're talking about?
[time=895] - Well, I think it's probably true for us as individuals, as well as in our marriage relationships and from time to time, even in parent child relationships, where we've moved away from the intensity and the type of first love that we once had.
[time=909] And that leads us to a lot of difficulties and a lot of withdrawal from life.
[time=913] And I know in my own life, I seek to keep renewing that first love emphasis and intensity.
[time=920] Well, it's wonderful to have a marriage.
[time=923] I've been with my wife for a number of years and know that we've not had all smooth years, but with the Lord's help, we can continue that relationship and the love can really grow.
[time=933] I'm looking forward to your message in just a few minutes.
[time=937] We're also excited about the fact that our new pastor, Russell Moore, will be with us on May 19th.
[time=943] He'll be here, that'll be his first service.
[time=945] Preaching here will have just one service at 10.30 a.m.
[time=949] at the Black Rock Baptist Church.
[time=951] We're going to have a reception from 9.15 to 10.15.
[time=954] And then about an hour and a half service, welcoming our new pastor and his family.
[time=959] He'll be preaching that morning.
[time=960] I hope that if you have an opportunity, you can be with us and fellowship that day.
[time=965] Now, just before we go back to our live portion of the program, I'd like to offer to you for the last time, a booklet entitled "The Two Futures." I mentioned last week that I've had the opportunity of comparing the book with even some of the newspaper articles of late and what a comparison there is of things that are happening in this world, things that are going to happen to the non-Christian and the wonderful things that we have to look forward to in the future.
[time=991] Now, this is the last time we're gonna offer this book, but I'd like to have you write this week forward.
[time=995] It's absolutely free.
[time=996] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1019] We look forward to the music now that we have coming up and then the message from our special guest, Dr. Carl Solvain.
[time=1025] Stay with us, please, for "The Bible Hour." (upbeat music)
[time=1037] [MUSIC - 133 seconds]
[time=1172] - Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=1177] Father, what a privilege it is to wake up in the morning and our first thoughts can be of you.
[time=1185] And we can say, "May Jesus Christ be praised." And as we see the light, we see the spiritual light.
[time=1190] We know that it comes from you because you say that you are the light of the world and no man walks in darkness that knows you.
[time=1197] And we're thankful for that.
[time=1198] And we're thankful for this privilege to be in this building today, worshiping with these believers and fellowshipping together.
[time=1204] We have notes of praise, Lord, and thanksgiving for people in our church, for whom we've been praying for a number of weeks that are improving in their health.
[time=1212] And we're just delighted to come to you and say thank you for interceding in their lives.
[time=1218] And we pray for those that will be having surgery in the days to come, that you will just prepare their bodies for this time and give the doctors wisdom as they do the surgery and give the patient strain.
[time=1232] There are many people about whom we don't know even in our congregation, Lord, that have needs today.
[time=1236] And we want to say that we believe that you help and you guide and you intercede in times of trouble.
[time=1243] And we call upon you, as you know the situation, to intercede and to help those that are in need today.
[time=1250] And we are thankful that we can be here to sing praises to your name, to lift up your name, to make it the light of the world so that others that are in darkness can know and have eternal life through Jesus Christ.
[time=1262] Thank you for the music that we've witnessed this day and we pray for the message, as it is brought forth by Dr. Solwein that you'll just give him freedom to proclaim the word in Jesus' precious name we pray.
[time=1273] [AMEN] I mentioned earlier that this has been just one of those kind of mornings where God is really blessed.
[time=1281] I've appreciated the ministry of music and smiles on your faces.
[time=1285] It's great to look out and see people that are anxious to be here and love the Lord and proclaim that in their countenance.
[time=1292] And we've had a very wonderful year in the sense of having men come to our pulpit and give us energy and renewed spiritual food for our lives week after week.
[time=1305] And we are very appreciative of those that have given of their time to come and minister here at Blackhawk.
[time=1311] Today we have Dr. Carl Solwein.
[time=1313] Dr. Solwein is involved in individual and family counseling right here in our city.
[time=1318] We are grateful for men who give of their time to help out families that are in need.
[time=1323] And I'm glad that he has the opportunity to speak to us today.
[time=1326] It was great in our first service.
[time=1328] I hope that you'll open your hearts and listen to him and respond accordingly.
[time=1331] Would you please welcome Dr. Carl Solwein.
[time=1334] (audience applauds)
[time=1344] - It's good to be back at Blackhawk and see the work that God is doing.
[time=1352] And I know you're all anxious to see your new pastor come.
[time=1356] And that's gonna be great.
[time=1358] I would encourage you as a congregation.
[time=1361] Get in lines to say to your pastor, what can I do and how can I be a part of the ministry and do what God's called this congregation to do?
[time=1369] This morning I'd like to share with you a little bit about where I am as an individual.
[time=1374] As a counselor, I spend most of my time allowing people to come into my office and share with me where they are.
[time=1381] And I sit and I attentively listen.
[time=1385] And you know, when you come to a service like this, the preaching part of the service is very similar.
[time=1392] Your job is to sit and attentively listen and my job is to be as open and honest as I can be in sharing with you.
[time=1399] Now, you have to understand that if you come to my office and I'm the one who's sitting and attentively listening, you have to pay me, okay?
[time=1407] And when I come here and preach and you sit and attentively listen to me, you still have to pay me, okay?
[time=1413] How many of you remember your first kiss?
[time=1417] Some of you remember it.
[time=1422] You just, you're a little hesitant there.
[time=1424] I remember my first kiss.
[time=1426] It was when I was in the sixth grade.
[time=1428] I remember that through the encouragement of some of my classmates, this girl and I went out into the parking lot at half time of a basketball game.
[time=1438] And we stood between two cars and we stood there for the longest time because we were very hesitant about this whole process.
[time=1446] And as we started to move closer, I realized I wasn't sure I knew how to hit her lips.
[time=1452] So I kept my eyes open.
[time=1454] Now, kissing my wife today, I still keep my eyes open.
[time=1458] I've never learned to change that.
[time=1460] But after that kiss, I remember laying awake for two nights, just thinking about that kiss.
[time=1468] It was unbelievable to me that experience.
[time=1470] And yet my first kiss was not my first love.
[time=1474] I didn't experience my first real love until I was a junior in high school.
[time=1478] And at that point, I found a very precious jewel in a little town outside of Fort Wayne called Arcola.
[time=1485] Now, my first love made me react in amazing ways.
[time=1490] I told everyone I knew about her.
[time=1493] I tried to show everyone who would look, the picture that I carried of her.
[time=1497] I couldn't get her off my mind.
[time=1499] No matter what I did, she was in my mind day and night and day and night.
[time=1503] I took her ever place that her mother would allow me to take her.
[time=1507] And I found that I just couldn't be with her enough.
[time=1511] I was proud to have her with me wherever I went.
[time=1514] I felt good when we were walking someplace and she was by my side or when we were driving and she was by my side.
[time=1520] I even ended up spending most of my money on her at that point in my life.
[time=1526] And I decided I needed to marry her just to get my investment back.
[time=1530] I wore out a 1955 Chevy Bellaire two-door hardtop
[time=1536] racing between Fort Wayne and Arcola on the Bass Road.
[time=1542] My first love was a tremendous experience.
[time=1547] What a thrill to experience first love.
[time=1551] And what a tragedy when you begin to realize that the intensity of that first love begins to drain away.
[time=1559] John wrote about a first love in Revelation chapter two.
[time=1563] I'd like for you to turn there.
[time=1565] Revelation chapter two.
[time=1569] We wanna begin reading with the first verse.
[time=1572] John writes in Revelation two, verse one,
[time=1579] to the angel of the church in Ephesus, right?
[time=1581] The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand.
[time=1584] The one who walks among the seven gold lampstands says this.
[time=1589] "I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance "and that you cannot endure evil men "and you put to test those who call themselves apostles "and they are not and you found them to be false.
[time=1601] "And you have perseverance and have endured "for my name's sake and have not grown weary.
[time=1606] "But I have this against you "that you have left your first love.
[time=1612] "Remember therefore from where you have fallen "and repent and do the deeds you did at first "or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand "out of its place unless you repent.
[time=1622] "Yet this you do have that you hate the deeds "of the nickelatons which I also hate.
[time=1627] "He who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says "to the churches, to him overcomes.
[time=1633] "I will grant to eat of the tree of life, "which is in the paradise of God." The Ephesians were receiving accommodation from the Lord.
[time=1641] They were being commended, first of all, for their participation.
[time=1645] They were deeply involved in the things of the Lord.
[time=1648] They were doing many good, godly, important things.
[time=1653] And the Lord recognized that.
[time=1655] Their efforts and their good deeds were not going unnoticed.
[time=1658] And the Lord commended them.
[time=1660] You've been doing a good job in those areas that other people can see that are recognizable.
[time=1665] They were taking a stand on public issues.
[time=1669] They were talking and dealing with the important things of life.
[time=1673] Outwardly they had a very good reputation.
[time=1675] And Jesus was commending them for their participation.
[time=1681] They were also commended for their purity.
[time=1683] They were pure in doctrine.
[time=1685] They believed the right theology.
[time=1686] They persevered in the truth of teaching God's word.
[time=1690] They were pure in fellowship.
[time=1694] They had separated themselves from the ungodly, from the false prophets and the heretics.
[time=1699] You see these Ephesian believers couldn't be faulted for what they were doing.
[time=1703] The Lord was commending them.
[time=1707] They were living according to knowledge rather than feelings.
[time=1710] They were being responsible and carrying out the duties that they had as a part of the body of believers.
[time=1715] And He also commends them for their perseverance.
[time=1720] In verse three, He says, "And you have perseverance and have endured for my namesake and have not grown weary." They were exercising good old stick-tutiveness.
[time=1731] They were coping with the pressures of life.
[time=1733] They were hitting the brick walls in life and they were staying with it and working through until they found a way around them.
[time=1740] They hung in there.
[time=1742] And they even did it for right motive.
[time=1745] They did it as unto the Lord.
[time=1747] Now, I've done most of those things in my life since I became a Christian at the age of 18.
[time=1754] And in outward appearance, my life would look pretty good.
[time=1759] Sometimes I wonder, though, if I don't line up a little bit with what Dick Vitale calls the all-airport team.
[time=1766] That's that group of basketball players that he says you'll see them in the airport and they're real tall and they're well-dressed and everything looks great and they look like they would be tremendous on the court, but he says they never get off the bench 'cause they can't do the job on the court.
[time=1782] You see, I've actively participated in serving the Lord.
[time=1788] I've not spent much time with the wrong crowd over the years.
[time=1791] I've sought to keep my doctrine scriptural, although there are times when that's been brought into challenge by other people, but mostly by heretics.
[time=1803] And I haven't yet given up, even though I've wanted too many times and feel like it most of the time, but there are times in my life where I'm aware, I have to be honest and say, you know, I've lost a degree of that first love intensity that I had when I was first saved.
[time=1823] You say, see, when I was first saved, I used to tell everyone about Christ.
[time=1827] Back when I was first saved, we still had gas station attendance and I'd pull in and get gas and boy, I'd love to have those attendance come out there and he's staying there pumping in the gas and I'm out the door and I'm back there talking to him about the Lord.
[time=1840] I witnessed to my neighbors.
[time=1843] I witnessed all my fellow workers at GE.
[time=1848] I talked to the students that I was with in high school at Northside.
[time=1852] I went around and I told all my relatives about my relationship with Christ and how my life was changed.
[time=1860] I haven't used to talk to strangers.
[time=1862] Back in those days, and I don't encourage it now, but back in those days, I used to stop and pick up every hitchhiker I saw.
[time=1868] I figured at 60 mile an hour, what's he gonna do?
[time=1870] Other than just sit there and listen to what I'm trying to tell him.
[time=1874] And I just didn't invite people to come to church.
[time=1877] I invited them to come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[time=1881] You see, I was excited and I was thrilled about my first love relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1888] I used to sit in bed at night and read the Bible for two, sometimes three hours.
[time=1893] And I was just amazed at what I was reading.
[time=1896] It was just overwhelming to me.
[time=1898] I longed to go to church.
[time=1904] I found myself at an altar for all types of needs.
[time=1909] I sat through services weeping and I sat through services laughing and I would sing and every once in a while, I'd even express an occasional layman.
[time=1920] You see, my heart was tender and the tug of God was easily sensed.
[time=1928] It was a first love relationship with Jesus Christ and nothing else mattered.
[time=1932] No matter what was going on in my life, it couldn't keep me down.
[time=1937] Where did it go?
[time=1940] Where does that first love relationship go in our lives as we identify the difference between how it was when we originally accepted Christ as our savior or over into the marriage?
[time=1955] Where does that first love relationship go and the intensity of that that we had when we were first dating or in the first few years of our marriage?
[time=1965] Where did it go for the Ephesians?
[time=1969] You see this passage in Revelation moves from the commendation to the evaluation and in verse four, the Lord says, "But I have this against you that you have left your first love." The Lord was displeased with the fact that the Ephesians were no longer carrying the intensity and the depth of the love that they once had.
[time=1995] The Lord was displeased.
[time=1999] You know, I find in working with people that we often focus on the wrong questions in life.
[time=2005] Most of the time we're asking questions like, are you pleased with your life?
[time=2011] Are you pleased with what God is doing in your life?
[time=2015] Or I hear questions, are you pleased with your spouse?
[time=2021] Are you pleased with your wife, your husband or pleased with your children?
[time=2024] And you know, I believe that the real questions in life are not, am I pleased?
[time=2030] The real questions in life center around is God pleased?
[time=2035] Is he pleased with what's going on in my life?
[time=2038] Paul said in Second Corinthians chapter five that he made it his ambition to please him, to please the Lord, that was his life's ambition.
[time=2049] My question should not be am I pleased with my wife, but is my wife pleased with me?
[time=2056] Are my children pleased with how I relate to them and the time that I spend with them?
[time=2062] I think the real question are people pleased with me
[time=2070] and is God pleased with me?
[time=2073] I have yet to find a couple come into my office for counseling and when I ask them to share why they're there, the husband says, well, our basic problem is that my wife only wants to do what I wanna do.
[time=2085] And she said, no, no, that's not the basic problem.
[time=2087] The basic problem is my husband only wants to do what I wanna do.
[time=2092] I've never had a couple like that.
[time=2094] Romans chapter 12 says in honor, preferring one another, the question should be, am I pleasing the other person?
[time=2103] Am I pleasing the Lord?
[time=2105] You see, the Ephesians were kind of pleased with what was going on in their lives.
[time=2110] They were doing many good things.
[time=2111] They were doing things which appeared to the world around them to be right.
[time=2116] And it appeared that everything was fine and that God was working and that their lives were all they should be, it appeared that they were happy.
[time=2126] And I struggle with the idea that I think as a culture,
[time=2132] we have made happiness one of our primary goals.
[time=2134] I have people who are breaking up families because they wanna be happy.
[time=2140] I have individuals who are destroying their lives because they're wanting to do something because they're wanting to be happy.
[time=2148] But you see, the Ephesians were only doing a part
[time=2155] of what God wanted.
[time=2157] They had the outward aspects of Christianity well in hand, but they had lost the intensity of their first love.
[time=2163] And with God halfway is not sufficient.
[time=2165] He's concerned about what I'm not doing as he is concerned about what I am doing.
[time=2170] And it takes that total response to God if we're going to please God, if he's going to be pleased with us.
[time=2177] I find so many times in working with people, it's so easy for us to meet all of the external and outward needs, especially in our home environments.
[time=2188] But husbands, how many of you are really meeting those internal needs?
[time=2194] How many of you are willing to open up and share the depth of what's going on in your life with your spouse?
[time=2201] You wives, how many of you are really sharing and meeting the internal needs?
[time=2206] We play a good game, but many times we're like the all-airport team.
[time=2213] The evaluation was that the Lord was displeased with them.
[time=2220] And the evaluation said that there was a disappearance, not of love in itself, but the intensity of the love.
[time=2228] I think there are some personal signs of when that love is gone.
[time=2232] I think you can identify at least some of the time when that love is no longer as intense as it once was.
[time=2238] The amount of time spent.
[time=2240] I used to spend hours with the Lord and I used to spend hours just working to get so I could be with my girl.
[time=2248] Enthusiasm toward, the joy of being with them,
[time=2254] the desire to tell others your thoughts focused on.
[time=2263] And a yearning to please them.
[time=2265] So many times in our relationship with Christ and in our relationship in our homes, we lose those things.
[time=2275] We go through the motions and through the routines, but we never really have that intensity of that first love relationship.
[time=2283] The twinkle in the eye is gone.
[time=2285] Even David said in his remorse, "My strength fail with me as for the light of my eyes.
[time=2289] It has also gone from me." What causes the disappearance of this intensity of the first love?
[time=2295] I'd share several things with you.
[time=2298] One of them is that I think over time we wear down.
[time=2302] You see, we move through life in such a rapid pace that we don't have the time to really regenerate.
[time=2311] And we get so buried under everything that we're doing that we don't take the time with our spouses and we don't take the time with our children.
[time=2318] We don't take the time with the Lord.
[time=2320] And I can justify doing those things.
[time=2322] I'm busy, I've got more to do than I can get done.
[time=2326] And I can even justify in my own mind.
[time=2328] Look, I'm in Christian counseling, I'm serving the Lord.
[time=2332] But you see, when I don't spend time at all the roads and it wears down and after a while, the intensity and the fire within is less than what it should be.
[time=2343] And then sometimes it's caused by discouragement.
[time=2347] Sometimes we go through difficulties in life and we get so discouraged that we lose that first love intensity.
[time=2354] And we can get to the point where we really don't care anymore.
[time=2358] Sometimes it's just the routine
[time=2364] that causes us to lose that intensity.
[time=2368] I find as Christians, whether I'm talking about the relationship with Christ or the relationship with our spouse, that we make the sublime into the ordinary.
[time=2380] I know you've heard the illustration before, but it's a good illustration.
[time=2383] It's the story of a man who's riding across the country on a train.
[time=2387] And he keeps looking out the window and he just keeps expressing, oh, oh, that's marvelous.
[time=2395] Oh, look at that.
[time=2397] And finally, the curiosity of the other man sitting in the seat was too much.
[time=2401] And he said, what in the world are you seeing out that window?
[time=2404] I don't see anything like that.
[time=2406] And the man said, you need to understand.
[time=2409] I've been blind from birth and I've just come back from corrective eye surgery.
[time=2414] And for the first time in my life, I can see that countryside out there in its magnificent.
[time=2420] And you see, we've turned all of that into the ordinary.
[time=2424] It doesn't impress us anymore.
[time=2425] We're not impressed with what we're doing and how we're experiencing our relationship with the Lord.
[time=2430] And we're often not impressed with what's happening in our families and in our marriages.
[time=2434] We've made it all routine.
[time=2436] We go through the motions day after day.
[time=2440] And then another cause of losing that intensity of first love is sin.
[time=2447] And I can guarantee you that any time your life gets hung up in sin, you will lose the intensity of your first love for your spouse and for the Lord.
[time=2455] Sin will rob you of that intensity.
[time=2457] They went from the commendation to the evaluation and then they went to the exhortation in verse five.
[time=2467] In verse five, the exhortation is remember, therefore, from where you have fallen and repented do the deeds you did at first.
[time=2474] Remember, you remember how it was with your wife when you first started dating her?
[time=2481] My wife and I didn't go anyplace without holding hands.
[time=2485] And now they're too sweaty.
[time=2487] When shortly after we started dating and in the first few years of our marriage, I had a 1964 Chevy, had bucket seats and one of those hard metal councils right in between the bucket seats.
[time=2501] And you believe that my wife and I used to ride in the same bucket seat?
[time=2507] We could actually both of us slide right down into that seat.
[time=2510] I taught her how to shift the four speed on the floor with her right hand.
[time=2515] And I worked the pedals and I drove with this hand and had my other arm around her.
[time=2522] Now, our car has a bent seat and I sit on my side and my wife sits clear over by the door on her side.
[time=2533] Now, if you're starting to think about that for a minute, you'll be able to figure out who moved, okay?
[time=2538] (audience laughing) When we were first married, when my wife would take a while getting dressed, you know, when she would walk in the living room and I'd look at her, I'd say, wow, you look great.
[time=2553] And now when she takes a long time getting dressed
[time=2559] and she comes down and she's ready to go, my comment is, it's about time you're ready.
[time=2565] Used to be that when my wife looked across the room
[time=2572] at me and made eye contact, I could feel a thrill from that.
[time=2578] That was tremendous.
[time=2579] And now when she looks across the room at me, I wonder what I did wrong, all right?
[time=2584] (audience laughing) What happens to that first love intensity?
[time=2590] What happens to our first love for the Lord?
[time=2595] As a young Christian, I went door to door.
[time=2601] I'd just go out and knock on a door and when somebody'd opened the door, I'd tell them who I was and the reason that I was there was to talk to them about Christ.
[time=2609] I remember the night I was saved.
[time=2614] I remember when I was totally yielded to the Lord and I just allowed God to take complete control of my life.
[time=2622] I can remember leading people to Christ.
[time=2627] I can remember leading a young lady named Barbara to the Lord and her whole life was so radically changed.
[time=2633] God did a miraculous thing in her life and she's still going on today and she's a pastor's wife.
[time=2638] I remember that I remember getting on a garage floor on my knees and praying with Charlie when he accepted Christ as his personal savior.
[time=2646] I can look back in my life and I can remember.
[time=2649] I can remember the way it was and the Ephesians were being exhorted to remember those experiences.
[time=2656] And if you want to read about them, they're recorded in Acts chapter 19.
[time=2661] Back there, they had a simple faith.
[time=2663] They just simply believed that God's word was true and he would do it.
[time=2667] Back there, they were filled with the Spirit of God and their lives were under his complete control.
[time=2674] They were seeing many people, one to Christ.
[time=2676] They were burning their cultic literature.
[time=2678] They were studying the word of God and growing and grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2685] Remember, I have a very close missionary friend.
[time=2690] She and her husband and her children spent their entire lives in Eoriongia.
[time=2697] And when they retired, much older than what they should have.
[time=2700] They stayed on the field because he was doing translation work longer than they should have.
[time=2704] But when she came back to the state, she wasn't back a year and she came into my office and she sat down, she started sharing with me and she started to cry and she said, "You know, when I close my eyes at night, "all I can see are the Money people reaching out their hands." And she said, "I want to go back.
[time=2725] "I just want to go back and just keep ministering and giving." And she said, "You know, I cry about this about every day." You see, there was a lady who had not lost the intensity of the first love.
[time=2736] She was on fire for God just as much as she was the day she first went to the mission field.
[time=2741] The exhortation is to remember.
[time=2745] Remember how it was with the Lord.
[time=2748] Remember how it was in your marriage at the beginning.
[time=2753] And then the exhortation is to repent.
[time=2756] That word means to the rear march, if I'm going this way, I must turn and go the opposite way with just the same degree of intensity.
[time=2765] Re-capture that first love, rekindle the fire.
[time=2770] Paul told Timothy, "Stir up within you." And I find most people believe that God is going to be the one who's going to stir all this up in us.
[time=2779] Let me tell you something.
[time=2781] The command in scripture is for us to stir it up.
[time=2784] It's my responsibility.
[time=2787] I need to learn how to stir up that relationship with Christ that brings me back to the first love.
[time=2794] And I believe that in our marriages.
[time=2798] People come into my office and say, "We've fallen out of love." My first response to that is, "I have good news for you." You can redevelop that.
[time=2810] There are things that you can do to stir that love anew and kindle that fire again.
[time=2816] And I lived for eight years in Georgia.
[time=2820] And when I moved back to Indiana and we lived just down the street here for four years, we had a fireplace.
[time=2828] And I thought all those years, the only thing you did to make a fire was put a few pieces of wood in there and put a couple pieces of paper under it and just light the match and it would go.
[time=2840] And for the first several tries, I was blaming the wood and I was blaming the chimney because it didn't have the right draft and you know what I found out after it was all said and done?
[time=2851] I did not know how to start a fire.
[time=2854] And I learned, I learned how to put the right ingredients
[time=2860] and I learned the right methodology to make that fire grow.
[time=2864] And it's the same process in keeping that fire alive.
[time=2870] And your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2872] It's the same process in keeping your marriage alive.
[time=2877] It's not too late.
[time=2881] What did you do when you were first saved?
[time=2885] What was it like when you had the thrill of Jesus Christ in your heart for the first time?
[time=2893] Nothing could sidetrack you.
[time=2899] You wanted everyone to know it.
[time=2900] Scripture is filled with people on a first love basis with Christ.
[time=2906] Andrew had a first love basis and he went and found his brother.
[time=2911] The woman at the well was on a first love basis
[time=2917] and she went and told her entire community and everyone responded and came to see what she was talking about.
[time=2927] The early Christians had a first love and they went everywhere preaching the gospel.
[time=2932] Today we're exhorted to live our lives in such a way that we need not tell people about Christ and that's not very effective.
[time=2941] I need to live it and I need to speak it.
[time=2944] And I did when I was first saved.
[time=2946] But perhaps I'm the only one who tends to lose
[time=2952] some of that intensity as I go through my Christian experience.
[time=2958] The Philippian jailer had a first love relationship and his entire family responded to Christ.
[time=2963] You see, a first love relationship with Jesus Christ is gonna result in people's lives being changed, your relatives, your friends, your neighbors, people that you know, their lives will be changed if you have a first love relationship with Christ.
[time=2977] I'm aware that there are times when I need to get back
[time=2983] to that first love relationship.
[time=2987] I'm aware that there are times that my heart needs to be stirred.
[time=2991] There are times that I need to remember and repent and turn the other way.
[time=2996] And perhaps there are some of you here this morning that need to remember and turn.
[time=3005] How long since you were touched by the love of Christ?
[time=3010] How long since you've experienced God's presence in your life so profoundly that you're broken from within?
[time=3018] How long since you've felt that for your wife or your husband?
[time=3024] How long since you've walked an aisle of the church
[time=3032] and prayed at an altar because you carried a burden for yourself or for someone else?
[time=3042] There are times when I'm aware that I've lost the first love relationship.
[time=3047] There are times when I'm aware in my relationship with Christ and my relationship with my wife that I need to stir that up and rekindle it.
[time=3058] Are you still as thrilled today as you were then?
[time=3064] In my counseling, the people who come to my office
[time=3071] are coming because their marriages have gone cold.
[time=3074] They have experienced what I call dry rot.
[time=3080] It all looks good on the outside, but inside it's pretty hollow, it's pretty meaningless.
[time=3091] The times shared, the experiences shared are gone.
[time=3095] We need to come back to our first love for Jesus Christ.
[time=3101] We need to come back to our first love for our mates.
[time=3105] What a thrill it is to experience that first love relationship.
[time=3111] And my encouragement and my challenge to you this morning is if you need to rekindle either one of those areas, take the steps to do that.
[time=3121] You need to sit down with your wife, your husband.
[time=3125] You need to share and talk about where you are and what you're feeling.
[time=3130] You need to talk about what we need to be doing in this marriage relationship to make it all it can be.
[time=3135] We need to spend time, but time alone is not sufficient.
[time=3138] There must be time, there must be openness, there must be quality sharing.
[time=3142] We need to get back to the things that we once did.
[time=3149] And in your relationship with the Lord, there are times when I have to get on my knees and confess, Lord, I've lost that fire and that zeal and that enthusiasm and my life is just moving day by day.
[time=3161] And I need to repent and I need to return.
[time=3167] And I need to allow God to stir again and be on fire as I was from the beginning.
[time=3173] I trust that as your pastor comes, he will find a church filled with people who are on a first love basis with Jesus Christ as excited and fired up and thrilled today as you were the day you were first saved.
[time=3191] I trust that when your new pastor comes, he will find marriage as husbands and wives who are as excited about each other as they were in the days that they were dating in the first few years of their marriage.
[time=3202] Then God will be able to take this congregation and do things that'll turn this entire community upside down.
[time=3209] Return to your first love.
[time=3214] Let's pray.
[time=3214] Our father, as we understand your word,
[time=3222] you've called us to a first love relationship.
[time=3226] Thank you for loving us.
[time=3230] And I pray that in Jesus' name, we will rekindle within that love for Jesus Christ and for our spouses and our families.
[time=3240] Thank you, Father, for your presence here with us this morning in Jesus' name.
[time=3245] [AMEN] Dr. Carl Solvine spoke this morning,
[time=3255] and one of the things that struck me was the energy that we have to have in our own lives to get back in our relationship with the Lord and also even with our own spouse.
[time=3270] Colossians, it says, if then be risen, when we know Jesus Christ is our Savior, seek those things which are above where Christ siteth at the right hand of God.
[time=3279] Set your affections on things above, not on things of the earth.
[time=3283] He goes on to say later in the chapter, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching, and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
[time=3295] And whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord.
[time=3303] Giving thanks then to our Heavenly Father.
[time=3306] I think today as we draw a close to this message and this service, we need to think about our own relationship with the Lord.
[time=3315] And as we relate to our own life with Him, we think of our pastor coming in just a few weeks.
[time=3321] And we need to be reminded that when Pastor Moore comes, that he'll be energized by the Holy Spirit and he'll be ready to lead.
[time=3329] But what needs to happen is that our people need to be humble before the Lord and submissive to the Lord so that God can use you, not only Russell Moore, but our entire congregation things of the Lord.
[time=3344] In a moment, we're going to pray and then we're going to turn together in our hymnals and sing the song, it's entitled, "He Touched Me." You remember the time when Christ took your life and took that heavy burden away from you and changed your life and lifted you from the awful Myra Clay and set you on a rock.
[time=3362] Be reminded of that and then as we sing, maybe the first verse will ask those of you that have never accepted Christ to come into your heart or you'd like to become members of our church to come forward.
[time=3372] And then in the second verse, we're going to sing and we're gonna ask people to come and just pray and ask God to just lead in their lives in an unusual way in the next few weeks as we prepare for the ministry of Russell Moore.
[time=3384] And we're going to close the service then by just leaving quietly.
[time=3387] And you can continue to come and pray for a moment and then leave as you finish praying.
[time=3393] Let's stand together and sing, "He Touched Me." Oh, "He Touched Me." [MUSIC - 55 seconds]
[time=3477] - We've been sharing with you today the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir, soloist Susan Stump and Rejoice.
[time=3484] The message was from our special guest, Dr. Carl Solvine.
[time=3488] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, let's take a moment together and pray this prayer.
[time=3495] Would you bow with me?
[time=3496] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I have this opportunity to bow before you today.
[time=3503] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3507] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3512] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3515] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3520] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
