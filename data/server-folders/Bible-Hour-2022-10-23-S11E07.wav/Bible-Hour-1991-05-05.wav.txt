[time=60] The young man had cut and run in the face of battle.
[time=62] Alexander looked at him and said, "Son, what's your name?" The young man sheepishly said, "Why, Alexander, sir?" The conqueror got enraged.
[time=70] He said, "What is your name?" He said, "Alexander, sir." He said, "I'm going to give you one more chance, son." "What is your name?" He said, "Alexander, sir." He said, "Alexander, sir." He said, "I'm going to give you one more chance, son." "What is your name?" He said, "Alexander, sir." The great Alexander looked at him, looked him in the eye and said, "I'm going to give you mercy this time, son, but either change your behavior or change your name."
[time=94] Oh, I believe that that illustrates today the way God must feel toward many believers.
[time=98] We profess the name of Jesus Christ, but our behavior does not emulate that in the way that we act.
[time=105] I believe that God is saying today to many believers, change your behavior or change your name.
[time=112] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible hour. Thank you for joining us.
[time=129] Speaking today as Associate Pastor Jim Pearson, Jim's message is entitled, "The Love that God Hates."
[time=137] His text is taken from the book of James, chapter 4, verses 1 through 10.
[time=143] Special music today includes a solo from Read the Favor and an instrumental solo from Debbie Johnson.
[time=151] We now join our service with a song from the sanctuary choir and orchestra entitled, "Name Above All Names."
[time=167] All the names that have raised and lived so much on them.
[time=176] There is one that's high above all of the rest of them.
[time=184] All names, oh, say pray, first of spoken.
[time=192] God and angel, one now sing his word.
[time=202] Then I go on the precious ring.
[time=209] Now I know that that was made.
[time=214] The name above all other names.
[time=219] The name of Jesus.
[time=224] No power is given to and made.
[time=230] And all the men, men and all men.
[time=235] The name above all other names.
[time=240] The name of Jesus.
[time=251] The name of Jesus, Jesus.
[time=257] The name of Jesus.
[time=275] Oh, there is something thousand.
[time=280] God and Savior.
[time=284] He's everything to me.
[time=287] And Jesus is His name.
[time=293] And I know that the precious ring.
[time=300] Now I know that that was made.
[time=304] The name above all other names.
[time=310] The name of Jesus.
[time=314] No power is given to and made.
[time=321] And all the men, men and all men.
[time=325] The name above all other names.
[time=331] The name of Jesus.
[time=337] The name is given to and made.
[time=341] And as we say.
[time=343] The name of Jesus.
[time=345] The name above all other names.
[time=367] The name of Jesus.
[time=377] The name above all other names.
[time=390] The name of Jesus.
[time=398] No power is given to and made.
[time=406] The name of Jesus.
[time=421] No power is given to and made.
[time=431] The name of Jesus.
[time=437] Jesus.
[time=453] [APPLAUSE]
[time=459] The name of Jesus.
[time=460] How majestic is his name.
[time=462] Let's sing the brief service found on 28.
[time=465] We'll speak first together as a chorus.
[time=468] Speaking Psalm 8 and we'll sing the following three songs as it's noted in your hymnal.
[time=474] Number 28.
[time=475] Let's stand please as we read the scripture together.
[time=481] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[time=488] You have set your glory above the heavens.
[time=492] From the lips of children and infants, you have ordained praise because of your enemies.
[time=499] To silence the foe and the avenger.
[time=502] When I consider your heavens and the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars.
[time=509] Would you have set in place?
[time=512] What is man that you are mindful of him?
[time=516] The son of man that you care for him.
[time=519] You make him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crown him with glory and honor.
[time=526] You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
[time=530] You put everything under his feet, all quads and earths and the beasts of the field.
[time=538] The birds of the air and the fishes of the sea, all that swim in the past of the seas.
[time=545] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.
[time=575] O Lord, how mighty is your name in all the earth.
[time=585] O Lord, how mighty is your name.
[time=590] O Lord, how mighty is your name in all the earth.
[time=662] O Lord, how mighty is your name.
[time=669] O Lord, how mighty is your name in all the earth.
[time=849] We have had great involvement in our worship together in music.
[time=858] We continue with music now as we open our hearts at ears as we listen to read the favors he comes to minister to us.
[time=863] Why have you chosen me?
[time=865] Let's listen to his ministry in music this morning.
[time=879] Why have you chosen me?
[time=892] Out of millions your child to be.
[time=899] When you know all the wrong that I've done.
[time=908] O how could you part?
[time=916] Forgive all my iniquity to save me and give Jesus your own inside.
[time=932] O Lord, help me be what you want me to.
[time=945] O Lord, I will strive to obey my life.
[time=959] I now give and for you I will be.
[time=968] And I will lie yourself all the way.
[time=982] I am amazed to know that a God so great can love me so.
[time=993] And he's waiting and wanting to bless.
[time=1003] His grace is so wonderful and his mercy is so bountiful that I can't understand it.
[time=1020] I must confess.
[time=1025] O Lord, help me be just what you want me to.
[time=1037] O Lord, Lord, I will strive to obey my life.
[time=1050] I now give and for you I will be.
[time=1062] O Lord, I will be by your side all the way.
[time=1071] O Lord, I now give only for you Lord I will be.
[time=1083] And I will walk by your side all the way.
[time=1105] O Lord, I now give and for you Lord I will walk by your side all the way.
[time=1122] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=1125] We're glad that you've tuned in for this service of blessing and inspiration.
[time=1129] I just want to remind those of you that are members of the Founders Club that have received fresh moments recently in the mail.
[time=1136] And I hope that you're taking time to read this every day.
[time=1139] It's a very inspirational booklet that comes to you and has articles for every day of the week
[time=1145] for your inspiration and encouragement.
[time=1147] So read along and let us know that you're reading fresh moments.
[time=1152] I have with me my guest and colleague Jim Pearson.
[time=1155] Good morning Jim.
[time=1156] Good morning Pete.
[time=1157] You're going to be preaching this morning.
[time=1159] Tell us a little bit about the message for today.
[time=1161] Two weeks ago I preached on the subject of wisdom and the need for wisdom in our life today.
[time=1165] I'm preaching for what James about what James tells us is the reason why we don't have that wisdom in our life and it's something that we call worldliness.
[time=1173] I've titled the message the love that God hates.
[time=1176] And Jim you've been at our church for a number of years now but before you came into the past read you were involved in secular work of how did God change your life?
[time=1187] What was it that brought you into the ministry?
[time=1189] Well Pete I've said many times.
[time=1191] I was a businessman in Fort Wayne, Indiana for several years but there was something about coming to Blackhawk as a layman.
[time=1198] I came to Blackhawk and I had the opportunity to see Christian businessmen.
[time=1202] Christian businessmen with a dynamic testimony and that inspired me.
[time=1207] And then as I began teaching and involved in various ministries at Blackhawk I began to feel that call to preach and teach and the call to the ministry and I worked with Rick Hawks at that time and counseled with him.
[time=1220] In 1986 I made that decision.
[time=1222] Well we're glad to have you on our staff.
[time=1224] I know that your wife is very actively involved in children's programs.
[time=1228] She along with you will have a number of activities in the summer that will be advertising on the Bible hour coming up.
[time=1236] You're involved in the Wednesday programs as well as Linda is that right?
[time=1240] Yeah we both are Pete.
[time=1241] Linda's involved in children's ministries and there's going to be something great for the children each week.
[time=1246] Her program's titled "He Has the Whole World in His Hands." It's about foreign missions.
[time=1251] In each week they'll visit a different country in the children's programs.
[time=1254] For us Pete we have practical living seminars in June.
[time=1257] Then we have some great speakers.
[time=1259] We have some great films lined up.
[time=1261] We're just going to have a real good time each Wednesday night here at Blackhawk.
[time=1264] Well Jim we'll be putting the schedule on the screen from week to week as we get closer to the summer program.
[time=1269] But thanks for all your efforts in preparing that for our help and edification.
[time=1274] We are pleased again to announce that next Sunday morning we'll have Dr. David Miller.
[time=1281] Dr. Miller is the president elect of Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1287] Very good friend.
[time=1288] He's taught Bible at the college for a number of years and will be with us speaking on that Sunday morning.
[time=1294] I'd also like to remind you that on May 19th right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church that will be the first Sunday that our new pastor and his family will be at Blackhawk.
[time=1304] We'll have a reception for them from 9.15 to 10.15 and then our morning worship service.
[time=1310] One service only that day will begin at 10.30.
[time=1313] That'll be a great day of celebration as we welcome the Russell Moore family to Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1319] I hope that you'll join with us and if you have an opportunity to come and worship with us that day, we'd love to have you at Blackhawk.
[time=1327] Just before we go back to the live portion of our service, I'd like to introduce you to a booklet entitled Relationships by Pamela Reeves.
[time=1336] We had a speaker last week that spoke on the family and we at Blackhawk are very interested in intent on seeing
[time=1343] that the family stays together and works hard at that relationship.
[time=1348] This is a great booklet that will encourage you. I want to read one quote from it.
[time=1352] It says involvement with people is always a very delicate thing.
[time=1356] It requires real maturity to become involved and not get all messed up.
[time=1362] It's an effort. We know that day by day it's an effort to communicate and to work with people and especially in our own families.
[time=1369] So we want you to receive this booklet if you'll write to us today.
[time=1372] Just write for the booklet entitled Relationships right to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1384] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1390] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1394] Now we're looking forward to the message from Jim Pearson in just a few minutes.
[time=1398] We'll go back to the live portion of our program for some music and then the message from God's Word. I hope that you'll stay tuned today.
[time=1431] [MUSIC - 201 seconds]
[time=1641] A song to prepare us, prepare us for worshiping God in prayer, and then a time in His Word this morning.
[time=1648] Won't you join together with me in prayer?
[time=1651] Father, indeed, you are the name above all names.
[time=1655] We have sung to your greatness this morning.
[time=1658] You are so worthy of all that we say.
[time=1661] You are so worthy of all of the praise that we give to you today.
[time=1664] Oh, your name is above all names.
[time=1666] Your greatness is above all other greatness.
[time=1669] You alone are the sovereign God of the universe.
[time=1672] You alone hold this world in the palm of your hand.
[time=1676] We worship you for the strength and the greatness that you give to us.
[time=1680] We thank you for the way that you gave your son that we might have everlasting life.
[time=1686] Father, we thank you for the way that you reach down to us in love.
[time=1690] That when we were yet sinners, you first loved us.
[time=1694] And Jesus came and gave His blood that we might have everlasting life.
[time=1700] Because we know that you are the power of the universe, we come to you this morning with requests,
[time=1706] I pray that you would give comfort to Joy Schindler and to Mary Plunkett, to joy in the loss of a daughter at age 43, to marry in the loss of such a good friend.
[time=1717] We don't understand why these things happen, but we know that you're in control.
[time=1721] We know that nothing happens to us that doesn't first pass through your hand.
[time=1726] But at the same time that we pray for those that have lost loved ones, we pray also for new life in our church.
[time=1733] Thank you for a new life in the family of Linda and Arlen, for reason.
[time=1737] Thank you for a new life to Dwayne and Angie Simanski.
[time=1741] Oh, we thank you for new children that will be raised in godly Christian homes, raised in the nature and admonition of your word.
[time=1748] Oh, I praise you for that.
[time=1750] We praise you for successful surgery this week for Don Swoverland.
[time=1754] Thank you that a doctor could take a vein from another part of his leg, put it together with another vein and restore circulation to the lower part of one of our limbs.
[time=1764] Thank you for the technology and the wisdom that you've given him to us today.
[time=1768] And now, Father, as we study your word, I would just pray that all of those that are here today would prepare their hearts, prepare their ears, prepare their minds, and they might receive your word and apply it to their lives.
[time=1780] In Christ's name, amen.
[time=1783] Well, two weeks ago, I had the privilege of sharing with you from this pulpit.
[time=1788] I shared a message entitled "Everybody Loves a Wise Guy." I told you that we need godly wisdom for daily living.
[time=1797] I believe that all of us as believers, as we go about the daily routine of making decisions
[time=1803] and solving problems and living the Christian life, need the wisdom of God in our lives
[time=1809] to help us make those decisions.
[time=1811] I told you that there are two kinds of wisdom in the world.
[time=1814] One is godly wisdom.
[time=1816] The Bible calls that wisdom that comes from above.
[time=1819] The godly wise man is the one who has great knowledge of God's everlasting word.
[time=1825] But it's also the man who takes that word and applies it to the everyday activities of his life.
[time=1831] That's what the Bible says is godly wisdom.
[time=1834] A second type of wisdom is worldly wisdom or earthly wisdom.
[time=1838] It's wisdom that the Bible says comes from below.
[time=1842] It's the wisdom or philosophy of man.
[time=1845] The wisdom or philosophy of man and the world in which we live.
[time=1849] It's a wisdom that makes decisions by leaving God out.
[time=1853] Well, a few weeks ago, my wife and I had the splendid opportunity of vacationing in sunny Florida.
[time=1859] It was a great time.
[time=1861] We had a wonderful time and a beautiful area that we were staying.
[time=1864] But I have to admit that I didn't use some godly wisdom.
[time=1868] The first day that we were there, I decided that there was no way that Jim Pearson was going to come back to the north without a deep dark bronze tan.
[time=1876] I have to admit that I had a desire in my heart for people to say to me when I came back, Jim, you look good.
[time=1882] You look dark.
[time=1883] I didn't want to come back as a pale face.
[time=1886] And so I took my book and I went out to the pool that first or second day and sat there in the sun.
[time=1892] Oh, it was wonderful.
[time=1894] And after about two hours in the sun, I could feel the rays starting to tingle on my skin.
[time=1899] And the thought went through my mind.
[time=1901] You see, I had knowledge.
[time=1903] I had knowledge that the Florida sun is very intense.
[time=1906] The Florida sun is so intense that just a short time in it can burn someone who hasn't had much time in the sun before that.
[time=1913] Well, I ignored that.
[time=1915] I knew I wanted to have a good tan.
[time=1917] A little while later, Linda came up to me and she said, Jim, you've been out in the sun an awful long time.
[time=1922] Don't you think you ought to put some sunblock on?
[time=1924] And I looked up at her and I think I said something real wise like sunblocks for sissies.
[time=1930] And then I went back to my book.
[time=1933] The book I was reading was called Wisdom.
[time=1936] Don't live life without it.
[time=1939] Well, a little later, my youngest son came up to me and he said, Daddy, you're looking awful red.
[time=1945] Well, I stayed out in the sun a little bit longer and I have to admit, I paid for it.
[time=1950] You know, I had knowledge.
[time=1953] God's word says the word to take care of our bodies, but I had an internal desire on that day to please someone else.
[time=1959] I wanted other people to look at me and say, oh, he got a good, healthy, handsome tan while he was in Florida.
[time=1965] I paid the price. I didn't use godly wisdom.
[time=1969] Well, that's what we spoke about a couple of weeks ago, but what we're going to do today is go on with the next ten verses.
[time=1975] For today, I want to talk about the thing that James will tell us.
[time=1979] It is that keeps us from using the wisdom of God in our lives.
[time=1984] James says that there's one thing more than anything else that keeps us from having the wisdom of God in our lives
[time=1990] and keeps us from using that wisdom to make decisions each day.
[time=1995] James calls it worldliness.
[time=1998] James will warn us today in the chapter four of the book of James about the danger of worldliness.
[time=2005] What is worldliness?
[time=2007] Well, worldliness is the condition of being drawn away from total loyalty to God by the attractions or the philosophies of the world around us.
[time=2018] It's the condition of allowing ourselves to be drawn away from the things of God, the pursuits of God,
[time=2024] and to allow ourselves to look to the world for our fulfillment and for our satisfaction in life.
[time=2031] And James says that when we leave our first love and when we go after that, we can't have that wisdom of God working in our lives and our lives can become great despair.
[time=2042] What's a worldly person?
[time=2044] Well, a worldly person is the one who has bought into the philosophy and wisdom of the world.
[time=2049] It's the one who says, "I'm going to do what I want to do. I have my own agenda.
[time=2054] I don't care if God has his agenda. I'm going to do what I want to do." The worldly person, the worldly believer says, "I'm going to get what I want out of life.
[time=2063] I'll be concerned about the needs of others, but not until my needs have been met first, not until I've taken care of myself."
[time=2072] Yes, worldliness. The worldly believer has adopted the values of the world.
[time=2078] James will tell us that godly wisdom can't flow from a person who has left his first love.
[time=2085] The Bible teaches that we are to be in the world, but not of the world.
[time=2090] We are to be in the world and we are in that world system.
[time=2093] And each day we walk and work and live in that world system.
[time=2098] If James tells us we don't have to succumb to worldliness, he tells us that we can beat it
[time=2104] and we can live for God and find our fulfillment in his righteousness and his life that he gives us.
[time=2111] Well, let's read these verses from James.
[time=2113] And as we do, I want us to see two points this morning concerning worldliness.
[time=2118] First of all, in verses one through five, we're going to look at the problem of worldliness.
[time=2123] And then in verses six through ten, we're going to look at the prescription or the solution for worldliness.
[time=2130] We can beat it and we can come back to our first love.
[time=2133] Well, let's read these verses today.
[time=2135] First ten verses of James chapter four.
[time=2138] He says, "What causes fights and quarrels among you?
[time=2141] Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?
[time=2144] You want something, but you don't get it.
[time=2146] You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want.
[time=2150] You quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.
[time=2154] And when you ask, you do not receive because you ask him with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
[time=2162] You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God?
[time=2168] Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
[time=2172] Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely?
[time=2179] But he gives us more grace.
[time=2181] That is why Scripture says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[time=2186] Submit yourselves then to God.
[time=2188] Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=2190] Come near to God and he will come near to you.
[time=2193] Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[time=2198] Grieve, mourn, quail.
[time=2200] Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.
[time=2204] Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will lift you up.
[time=2208] All this morning I want us first to take up the problem of worldliness.
[time=2213] I know that many of you like to take notes when someone is preaching.
[time=2216] And if you're taking notes this morning, under this first heading of the problem of worldliness, we're going to first in verses one through three, look at the symptoms of worldliness.
[time=2225] And then in verses four and five, I'm going to give you some definitions of worldliness that James gives us in the text.
[time=2232] Well, let's look first of all at the symptoms of worldliness.
[time=2236] James says that worldliness is friendship with the world.
[time=2240] He says it is dangerous to the believer, but it's dangerous to the believer.
[time=2244] But more than that, it's especially dangerous when it invades the church of Jesus Christ.
[time=2251] Here's what he says.
[time=2252] What causes fights and quarrels among you?
[time=2255] Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?
[time=2259] James is describing a local assembly in which he says they have a tremendous amount of fighting and quarreling.
[time=2266] Now the King James Version there says warfare.
[time=2269] It's not really a warfare like we would think of with armies.
[time=2273] It really is battles or fighting among believers.
[time=2277] Now notice what do you say?
[time=2279] He says that there is fighting.
[time=2281] He says there is strife.
[time=2283] He's saying that there is an undercurrent of hostility.
[time=2286] There are problems in the church.
[time=2289] There is an undercurrent of hostility.
[time=2291] Interpersonal relationships have broken down.
[time=2294] There is great strife.
[time=2296] And he says it's going on on a continual basis.
[time=2300] Now notice he says not only fights, but he also says quarrels.
[time=2305] In the English language, we use these two words interchangeably.
[time=2308] Somebody is fighting with somebody else.
[time=2310] They're quarreling, but the two words are different in Greek.
[time=2314] In Greek, the word quarreling means explosive occasional outbursts or battles.
[time=2320] And so what is James telling us is the first symptom of worldliness.
[time=2325] He is saying it is fighting and quarreling within the body.
[time=2329] It is a church that exists, a church that exists where there is just quarreling and fighting.
[time=2337] A general undercurrent of hostility and undercurrent of hostility with occasional outbursts or explosions of anger and fighting.
[time=2347] And James says oh that's wrong.
[time=2350] That's worldliness.
[time=2352] And he gives us two symptoms of worldliness and a worldly church.
[time=2357] Well he doesn't stop there because as he goes on in the verse he tells us where that comes from.
[time=2362] Notice he says don't they come from your desires that battle within you.
[time=2368] That word their desires comes from the Greek word he don't own.
[time=2373] It's where we get our English word hedonism.
[time=2376] Hedonism is the pursuit of pleasure at any cost.
[time=2380] A hedonistic person is the one who says I'm going to get what I want.
[time=2384] I'm going to get the things that I want in life.
[time=2386] I don't care who I hurt.
[time=2388] I want pleasure and I'm going to have it.
[time=2391] Well James says here that that's the root cause.
[time=2394] He says there is something inside you.
[time=2397] There is something that's warring inside of you and it manifests itself in the symptoms of fighting and quarreling.
[time=2406] Oh worldliness will lead to fighting and quarreling in the church because we will be looking to meet our own selfish needs and not the needs of others.
[time=2415] Well let's go on because he gives us a couple of more of the symptoms of worldliness in verse 2.
[time=2421] He says you want something but you don't get it.
[time=2424] You kill and covet but you cannot have what you want.
[time=2428] You quarrel and fight.
[time=2429] You do not have because you do not ask God.
[time=2432] The second two symptoms he gives us are killings and covetousness.
[time=2437] Killings and covetousness.
[time=2439] Now probably he didn't mean actual killings there.
[time=2442] That is probably a hyperbole for hatred.
[time=2444] It's unlikely that murders were actually taking place within the body of believers but probably stands there for hatred.
[time=2452] And so he is saying that another symptom is hatred and then covetousness.
[time=2457] Covetousness is anger, jealousy and envy toward others.
[time=2462] How does it come about?
[time=2463] He says you want something.
[time=2465] You desire something.
[time=2467] That desire inside of you wants to be fulfilled.
[time=2470] You look to the world for some type of fulfillment.
[time=2473] And when you don't get what you want, that desire and that anger wells up inside of you.
[time=2479] And it manifests itself in hatred toward others and covetousness and anger.
[time=2485] You want what somebody else has because you don't have it.
[time=2489] Oh James says that's worldliness.
[time=2491] He says we're supposed to be content with what God has given us in life.
[time=2496] He says that attitude today, that attitude then was wrong.
[time=2500] Oh what's he given us here?
[time=2502] He's given us the picture of a person who has plugged into the world system.
[time=2506] He's given us the picture of a person, a believer who has plugged into the system of the world and is looking for his fulfillment.
[time=2514] Looking for his contentment in the things that the world has to offer.
[time=2518] The attractions, the pleasures and all that's there.
[time=2522] But notice that James has said, he has said you look for it, but you don't find it.
[time=2528] He's saying you'll never find contentment in those pleasures and attractions of the world.
[time=2533] Why not?
[time=2534] Let's read on.
[time=2535] He says you have not meaning, you have not contentment because you ask not God.
[time=2542] You do not ask God.
[time=2544] What James is telling them is you're looking in the wrong place.
[time=2548] You're looking in the wrong place for your contentment.
[time=2550] You're seeking the things of the world.
[time=2553] Why don't you come to God and seek reward in him?
[time=2557] Seek your fulfillment in God.
[time=2559] He'll give it to you today.
[time=2561] James says that.
[time=2563] He's talking of a person who's looking for fulfillment in our society today.
[time=2568] He's saying that there are believers who are looking for fulfillment in a promotion at work and when they don't find it, there's envy.
[time=2575] There's jealousy.
[time=2576] Sometimes there's even hatred.
[time=2578] He says that there are people looking for satisfaction and fulfillment in homes and cars and money.
[time=2584] And James is saying when you do that, you're not looking to God and even if you accumulate all of those things,
[time=2590] you'll never have true contentment because true contentment only comes from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2597] He says you don't look to God and then notice what he says.
[time=2600] He says even when you do, when you do ask, when you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your own pleasures.
[time=2611] He says first of all, you don't ask God.
[time=2615] But he says even when you do, even when you come to God and you pray, oh you don't pray for the right things, you pray with an improper motive.
[time=2623] He says you don't pray for your friends to build them up, you don't pray for the souls of the unsaved to be one to Christ.
[time=2632] Oh you don't pray for God's will to be done in your life.
[time=2635] No, you pray for more of the things that you want in life.
[time=2638] You pray for more things.
[time=2640] Why?
[time=2641] So that you might add them to your stockpile.
[time=2643] Consume them upon your own desires, he says, your own lust.
[time=2647] A better word there would be squander.
[time=2649] You want to just squander them for your pleasure.
[time=2652] Oh what is he drawing here a picture of?
[time=2654] He's giving us symptoms of worldliness.
[time=2657] The worldly person he said is involved in fighting and quarreling and envy and strife because he seeks to find fulfillment in the things of the world.
[time=2670] He says you never will.
[time=2672] You never will.
[time=2674] Oh I believe the best illustration of this type of person is found in Luke chapter 15.
[time=2679] You don't have to turn to it.
[time=2680] We all know the story so well.
[time=2681] The story of the prodigal son.
[time=2683] Remember that story the young man.
[time=2685] He was entitled to probably one third of his father's wealth.
[time=2689] He had been raised in a good and godly home.
[time=2692] He was a part of the family business.
[time=2694] It was farming.
[time=2695] But each day as he went out into the field, each day he looked to the big city over the hill.
[time=2701] And those desires and longings weld up inside of him.
[time=2704] And he began to desire the pleasures and the things of the world.
[time=2708] He began to lose his loyalty to his home, to his family, to his religion.
[time=2713] He began to look to the things of the world.
[time=2715] And finally he went to his father and he said give me what belongs to me.
[time=2719] And Luke says he went out into the world and went into riotous living.
[time=2723] That means he went out and squandered his fortune in every kind of pleasure imaginable.
[time=2729] Wine, women and song.
[time=2731] He wanted everything.
[time=2732] He wanted all the pleasure.
[time=2734] And he had it because the Bible says there's pleasure and sin for a short season.
[time=2740] But then there was a downturn in the economy we would say today.
[time=2744] The economy went bad in the area in which he was and he lost his money.
[time=2749] He couldn't find a job and finally he settled for the lowest job that a Jewish person could have.
[time=2755] Feeding the pigs for another farmer.
[time=2759] And as he sat in the pig's die wishing he could eat the food of the pigs totally filled with despair and emptiness.
[time=2768] After having pursued the worldly life he got up and he went back to his father and repented of his sins and his father received him.
[time=2777] Oh the Bible teaches that when we live the worldly life we won't find fulfillment.
[time=2782] He says that if we are a believer and we go after the worldly attractions we won't be the believer that God wants us to be.
[time=2788] He won't be able to use us the way he wants to use us.
[time=2791] His wisdom will not be able to flow from us in the decisions that we make.
[time=2796] And we will have destruction in our lives.
[time=2800] Yes he's given us the symptoms.
[time=2802] The symptoms first of all but now in verses 4 and 5 he gives us some definitions.
[time=2808] Notice in verse 4 and 5 he calls them first of all you adulterous people don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God.
[time=2817] What is he saying there?
[time=2819] He is calling worldliness spiritual adultery.
[time=2823] He is saying all of you are spiritual adulterers.
[time=2826] Now James is the master illustrator.
[time=2829] James is great at telling stories and illustrating the truths that he's teaching and he's using the physical act of marriage.
[time=2836] He's saying that when you got married you pledged your devotion.
[time=2840] You pledged everything your commitment to that one person.
[time=2844] You said I am yours.
[time=2846] I am yours.
[time=2847] You are mine.
[time=2848] We are the only one for each other.
[time=2851] And that's the way it will always be.
[time=2853] But then as we know in our society today as then illicit relationships develop and people get involved with other people.
[time=2862] And that's adultery.
[time=2864] Well James is using that and he is saying to these people that's what you're doing with Christ.
[time=2869] That's what you're doing.
[time=2870] You're committing spiritual adultery in your worldliness.
[time=2873] He's saying when you came to Christ you gave your life to him.
[time=2876] You came to Jesus Christ.
[time=2878] You gave your total devotion.
[time=2880] You committed yourself to Jesus Christ.
[time=2883] But then you've gone off.
[time=2885] You've lost your first love.
[time=2887] You've gone off into the world of worldliness and you've been pursuing the pleasures and the things that will never bring fulfillment.
[time=2896] Oh he says you've committed spiritual adultery.
[time=2906] Oh he says that we are not to have a divided devotion.
[time=2910] We are to be only for Christ.
[time=2912] When we look to worldly pursuits.
[time=2914] When we look to the world for fulfillment.
[time=2916] When we look to the world for peace.
[time=2918] When we look to the world with our longings and try to satisfy our desires and the things of the world.
[time=2924] He says peace will never come and it's spiritual adultery.
[time=2928] Those are strong words.
[time=2930] But I would submit today that those strong words show us how strongly God hates worldliness in his children.
[time=2939] Let's look at the next thing that he says.
[time=2941] He goes on to say don't you know that it's friendship with the world.
[time=2945] Another definition for worldliness would be friendship with the world.
[time=2949] Now what is the world that he's talking about here?
[time=2952] Basically the world we learn from scripture is the world system that currently is under the control of Satan.
[time=2959] It says that he is the God of this world and that world in which we all work and live.
[time=2965] That world is controlled and energized by the evils of Satan and his angels.
[time=2972] Well he says that when we make friends with the world he's saying that we cozy up to those relationships.
[time=2978] We cozy up and we reach out for the attractions that Satan has laid out there as temptations to us.
[time=2985] And he says that when we do that then we lose our first love.
[time=2988] We take our eyes off God. We have a divided loyalty and our actions are looking to the world.
[time=2995] And he says that's friendship with the world.
[time=2997] And notice that he says that God hates that indeed it's hatred toward God.
[time=3003] God is a jealous God.
[time=3006] Notice what he says in verse 5.
[time=3008] Or do you think scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies us intensely?
[time=3016] What did he mean by that?
[time=3017] He was saying that God is jealous and the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the divine representative of deity within us,
[time=3027] is jealous and yearns for our devotion and our commitment and does not want us to divide our commitment with the world.
[time=3035] He wants it all. He wants us to be totally devoted to him, friendship with the world.
[time=3042] Listen to the wisdom of man.
[time=3046] That's what the world says. Listen to the wisdom and the philosophy that I have for you.
[time=3051] James says listen to the wisdom of God.
[time=3054] Find your fulfillment in the things of God because you'll never find it in the things of this world.
[time=3059] And when you do look to the world you have a divided loyalty and God's wisdom will not flow through you.
[time=3066] The great world conqueror Alexander the Great was confronted by a young soldier.
[time=3072] The young soldier had cut and run in the face of battle.
[time=3075] He had been up against the enemy and he had turned and ran and cowered us.
[time=3079] And after the battle was over Alexander's men brought the young man before the great conqueror.
[time=3085] He said son what's your name? The young man looked at him sheepishly and said Alexander.
[time=3092] And Alexander the Great looked at him with anger that that man would have his name and he said what is your name son?
[time=3098] The young man said Alexander sir.
[time=3102] Alexander the Great became livid with rage and he said son what is your name? I'll give you one more chance.
[time=3109] Alexander sir Alexander the Great looked at him and he said you are guilty of the charges against you.
[time=3116] But I'm going to give you mercy this time but I'm going to tell you this.
[time=3122] Either change your behavior or change your name.
[time=3128] I believe that today as God looks down upon me upon all of us as he looks at his church.
[time=3135] I believe that there are times when he's grieved and I believe that there's times when God must feel like saying change your behavior or change your name.
[time=3146] He calls it friendship with the world. He calls it spiritual adultery.
[time=3152] He wants our total devotion. Our total devotion only to him today.
[time=3157] Or are you devoted to him if you're here today and you're not a believer.
[time=3161] Have you given your heart to Jesus Christ? Have you given your heart and soul to him that he might use you if you're a believer here today?
[time=3171] Do you have feelings of emptiness inside?
[time=3174] Are you happy today with the life that you have? Oh I pray that you are.
[time=3178] But if there are feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction in your life, oh perhaps it's because you're going after the pleasures of the world that will never bring contentment.
[time=3188] That he says will never bring the fulfillment that we long for.
[time=3193] Well that's the problem. But the good news is there's a prescription.
[time=3198] We don't have to live with worldliness in our lives. We can beat it. We can go on. There's a prescription given here for having the victory over worldliness and a right relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3209] He gives it in verses 6-10. He says it's not hopeless. Oh our lives will never be free of that sin nature that wells within us. We know that.
[time=3219] That sin nature as long as we're in this body will always be there. But he says that we can have power and we can live the Christian life.
[time=3227] Because the pull and the attraction of the world is great. But the power of God is greater. He tells us in these verses.
[time=3234] Let's look at the prescription. How we can deal with this problem of worldliness in our own lives. Notice he says verse 6.
[time=3241] But he gives us more grace. That is why scripture says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[time=3250] The first step in overcoming worldliness is to humble ourselves.
[time=3256] He says here that if we resist God, if we resist God and embrace the world, that he will resist us. That's pride. And he says that he will not embrace us if we're proud.
[time=3267] But he says that if we humble ourselves, if we come to him and we humble ourselves before him and come to him and obey him, that he will give us something, he calls it his grace.
[time=3281] Grace is the power for Christian living. Grace is the power to live the Christian life. And when we come to God humbly, he gives us that power in our daily life to live the victorious Christian life and to defeat the sin of worldliness.
[time=3297] Oh, I've watched it in the lives of many here today. We had one in the first service today that lost a daughter just yesterday. And as she came, and as there were tears in her eyes, and as we embraced, I said to her, you're so strong in your faith.
[time=3312] It's the grace of God, the power to live the Christian life. Paul said when my strength fails, God's strength took over. And I live the Christian life because God's strength lives in me.
[time=3325] But we first must come humbly, or we can never be proud. But then let's go on. He says, number one, we humble ourselves. Then he says, submit yourselves then to God. He is saying that we should submit our will to God.
[time=3341] The worldly person says, I want what my will wants to do. He says if we will humble ourselves and submit our will to God, to his perfect will, if we will come to God and say, I'll go where you want me to go. I'll do what you want me to do.
[time=3360] Then God can use us and we can defeat that worldiness in our lives. He is saying that we need to submit. And then in that same verse, he says, resist the devil and he will flee. We need to resist. That's the third point of the prescription. Resist the devil.
[time=3377] Now, this is a defensive stance. The idea here is withstanding an attack. How do we withstand the attack? Well, we know that Paul tells us in Ephesians chapter 6 that we are to put on the armor of God. That's how we withstand the attack. How do we would do it?
[time=3393] Well, he will tell us there that we are to take the sword of the Spirit. He means that we are to take the word of God inspired in an errand and saturate our lives with it and learn and have the wisdom and the knowledge of God as we thoroughly know his word.
[time=3408] Well, that's one step in putting on the armor of God. Secondly, it says that we are to pray fervently in the Spirit. Come to God and pray fervently for his will and humble ourselves in prayer and ask him for the power to live and to withstand the attacks.
[time=3426] Oh, I believe thirdly, he tells us that another way of withstanding the attack is to yield totally to the control and the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives as we live for him.
[time=3439] Well, you can look up those in Ephesians chapter 6, but he says that we are to resist. Then notice in verse 8, he goes on to say, "Come near to God, and he will come near to you. Come near to."
