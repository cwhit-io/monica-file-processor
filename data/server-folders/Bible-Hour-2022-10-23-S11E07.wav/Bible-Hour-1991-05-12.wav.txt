[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=60] - Young people are not in our churches today.
[time=64] The reason is, I believe that they're facing me and they're facing me and they're not in my life.
[time=73] I'm not in my life.
[time=83] - Young people are not in our churches today.
[time=86] The reason is, I believe that they're facing me and they're facing the impossible.
[time=92] The impossible in their jobs, their career, maybe even their marriages.
[time=98] Maybe part of the problem is, those of us of an earlier generation have never taught them the song.
[time=106] Nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=114] I have some answers from God's word that would be able to help us with some creative suggestions to help our young people.
[time=124] They need to know, God works the impossible.
[time=130] (dramatic music) - Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music,

[time=387] - Hey man, let's continue singing about the greatness of our God.

[time=404] (orchestral music)
[time=434] [MUSIC - 181 seconds]
[time=629] Amen, God bless you, thank you, you may be seated.
[time=632] It is a thrill to direct the men's choir, but even more so than the sound is to see these godly men desiring to be a man of God and a leader in their homes.
[time=642] Thank God for the medium of music.
[time=644] Same message, the Lord Jesus Christ, many different styles, we're gonna listen to now the beautiful new contemporary sound of the group's celebration.

[time=741] (soft music) [MUSIC - 91 seconds]
[time=857] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=860] I'm so glad that you tuned in today.
[time=861] I hope that you've already received inspiration from the music that we presented today.
[time=867] Oh, this is an exciting day to remind you that if you're watching in the Fort Wayne area and you're watching it early in the morning here on our station, you have the opportunity to come and join with us for our first service with our new pastor.
[time=882] Pastor Russell Moore and his wife Heidi and family will be with us today and they'll be speaking at one service at 10.30 a.m.
[time=891] We have a 9.15 kind of a continental breakfast time from 9.15 to 10.15 and then a service at 10.30 with our new pastor, Russell Moore.
[time=902] If you're in our area, come and join us.
[time=904] We'd appreciate that very much.
[time=906] I wanna tell you about an event that's coming up that you need to plan for and set the data side.
[time=911] On June 28th, we will be having our annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=916] This is the 18th year that we've done the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=919] We're calling it this year Main Street America and we will have a great time saluting America and those men that served in our recent conflict, Desert Storm and we will be saluting America and our Heavenly Father in thanking him for the privilege to be in America.
[time=940] We do love America and we do love the privilege that we have of serving our God here with great freedom.
[time=946] So come and join us at 4.30 in the afternoon on Sunday, June 28th.
[time=951] I'd like to introduce you now to our speaker of the morning, Dr. David Miller.
[time=956] Dr. Miller is from Western Baptist College and he's the new president of that institution.
[time=962] Good morning, Dr. Miller.
[time=963] - Good morning, good to see you.
[time=965] - I'm gonna call you David if I may.
[time=967] That feels a little bit more comfortable.
[time=968] We've had an association over the years.
[time=970] I really count by years of teaching at Western as a real privilege and I am so thankful.
[time=976] I've said to our staff here and to our people how grateful I am of the many staff members at Western that are faithful.
[time=984] Not every year has been a banner year for Western in terms of the financial situation.
[time=992] We've had some hardships there but God is blessing and tell us just a little bit about what you see as you become the president of Western Baptist College this fall, what are some of the exciting things you see ahead for that school?
[time=1004] - We're excited about what God is doing.
[time=1006] The last five years we've seen a 62% increase in enrollment, seems to be a lot of enthusiasm by our students, by our constituency and we're happy for this.
[time=1019] We have a new dean, Dr. Wayne House who's written several books and he has just joined us this past year.
[time=1026] So we're real excited about some of the things that we have going for us.
[time=1031] - Oh no, we even have some students that are from our area and we have one student, a former student employed at our church here, Ed has done a great job in the television and sound areas of our church and worked with the master's touch as the road manager when we were out there at Western.
[time=1049] David, we talk a lot even before we began this program here about student relationships and how much we cherish working with the students and the relationships that we have.
[time=1061] It was ironic that just yesterday I received a letter from a former student, her name is Susan Prettyman and she was influenced by another Western student who encouraged her to go to Israel and has taken her some time but I believe in about the 1st of June she's going to be going over there.
[time=1076] There are a number of students out there not that are out across the world from Western.
[time=1081] - I'm excited I've written a number of students and asked them if maybe they'd send me back a picture and maybe put something on a tape for the inauguration of this position and as I've looked at this I've seen students all over the world and Western has had I think a great impact on places both here in this country and abroad in training these young people.
[time=1106] - Well David I want to thank you and when you go back to Western I want you to thank the staff.
[time=1111] I have a daughter that graduated from Western and my son-in-law who's now in seminary.
[time=1115] We are grateful for that college.
[time=1117] It had a great influence on the Kobe family and we pray regularly for Western and we're glad that you're here today and a few minutes we're going to hear from Dr. Miller as he speaks to us.
[time=1127] Just before we go back to our regular service we've talked about relationships here on the insert and I want to remind you that we're offering a booklet this month entitled Relationships by Pamela Reeves.
[time=1138] It's amazing how we can influence one another and how important it is to have Christian brothers and sisters that can help us in our Christian walk and even help us as God directs them to help us in our relationships and in the direction that we should go.
[time=1153] So we want to offer this book to you today.
[time=1155] I hope that you'll write for it.
[time=1157] You can receive the booklet entitled Relationships by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1168] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1177] I hope that you'll stay with us for the remainder of the Bible Hour.
[time=1181] We have some more music and then the message from God's word from our special guest, Dr. David Miller, president of Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1189] Please stay with us.
[time=1191] (gentle music)
[time=1198] [MUSIC - 207 seconds]
[time=1414] (audience applauding)
[time=1430] - You imagine the complete trust and confidence when Horatio Spafford wrote that song at the death of his children, the drowning?
[time=1438] How much he put his trust in Jesus Christ knowing that in his time, he was working out all things.
[time=1444] I appreciate too, not only the trust that Horatio Spafford had, but those of you in our congregation that recently have witnessed trials and tribulations in your own lives and you have put your trust entirely in Jesus Christ.
[time=1457] That's a great encouragement to us.
[time=1460] Jack Saylor was up here in the second row of the choir.
[time=1463] And a year ago, he was walking with crutches and anticipating making a special wheelchair.
[time=1470] And today he walked up the steps and got in the choir loft and sang.
[time=1474] And I say praise the Lord because he continues to put his complete trust in Jesus Christ and realizes whatever God has for him and the number of days that he has left on this earth, it's in God's time.
[time=1487] And he trusts in him.
[time=1489] And we appreciate that song, Lisa, thank you.
[time=1491] Someone said the other day to me that it's a good thing that Pastor Morris coming as our senior pastor because Pete Coby is running out of friends to preach.
[time=1502] (audience laughs) I want to thank you for the number of men who've come and you have supported so well and they've done such a tremendous job in encouraging us.
[time=1513] I want to say too that I'm very grateful that I've had the opportunity to be in institutions where there are men that love the Lord, that study the word and preach the word so that I can be edified and you can be edified.
[time=1526] Our speaker today is Dr. David Miller.
[time=1528] He's the president-elect of Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1532] For a number of years, David Miller has been the chairman of the Bible department of Western Baptist College.
[time=1538] I remember well when I went there to be interviewed for a job at Western.
[time=1543] We were sitting in the living room of Dr. Haberin, the academic dean and among the committee members was David Miller.
[time=1549] And when we got to the theology questions, I answered the first two or three fairly easily and then they got a little bit more difficult and a little bit more difficult and I reminded them that I was coming to teach music and not theology.
[time=1563] If these men have a real heart for the Lord, as you listen today, you'll realize that God is in the ministry of many of our colleges today and He does work miracles.
[time=1573] And I am privileged to introduce to you the new president of Western and I'm so glad that He has taken over the helm and I know God is going to continue to bless that institution in Salem, Oregon.
[time=1583] Would you welcome to our platform, please, Dr. David Miller.
[time=1586] (audience applauds) - Thank you, Pete.
[time=1597] Certainly an honor to be in your church today, even though I'm the last of his friends and here to preach to you.
[time=1607] I do have to apologize for some of the questions that I think I asked Pete and so I'd like to do it in front of all of you.
[time=1614] But you know, as I thought about it, the real reason was is he came just about the time that I graduated from Grace Seminary in Winona Lake.
[time=1625] And I really think the blame for all of this should go to the former president, Dr. Homer Kent, who happens to be with us today.
[time=1632] And so I've made my apology if he'll stand and make his, then everything will be all right.
[time=1638] But that's what happens when you go to school.
[time=1641] You get thinking about all of these things.
[time=1645] Some of the greatest years we ever had, Western Baptist College were the years that Pete was there in charge of our music.
[time=1652] In fact, I remember when he resigned to come here, I thought this is the end.
[time=1657] And I know he's had a great ministry here.
[time=1660] I certainly have missed him and I know you people have been blessed.
[time=1664] And when you fire him, I trust that you'll give me a call because I've got a place for him in the future.
[time=1672] It's good to be here.
[time=1674] It's good to see your cheerful hearts, good to be able to celebrate what parents and especially mothers are doing for their children.
[time=1682] And I trust that you'll be blessed as we look to God's word today.
[time=1686] Let's pray.
[time=1689] Father, we're thankful that we can come and be able to lift up our hearts and praise and say it as well.
[time=1696] It is well because indeed you're the sovereign ruler of the universe as well as the one who rules over our lives.
[time=1705] And we would ask that you would just direct and help even as we look to your word today.
[time=1711] May you give us clarity of thinking.
[time=1714] May you instruct us from your word and we'll give you the praise for it in Christ's name.
[time=1720] [AMEN] I'd like to share a concern with you today because recently I noticed this statistic and it is that there are fewer people in our churches today who are attending a church who are in the age bracket of the 20s.
[time=1741] Fewer than any other previous generation of those who were in their 20s.
[time=1747] And that's a concern to me.
[time=1750] It's a concern because these are tomorrow's leaders, our teachers, those who will help us.
[time=1757] And yet as we look around today, they are not in our churches.
[time=1763] I have to ask this question, why?
[time=1766] And I wonder if maybe they're not facing the impossible today.
[time=1770] They're looking at their jobs, their career, their marriages, the global problems that we face.
[time=1775] And they're saying, there's nobody here to help us.
[time=1779] Certainly not God.
[time=1782] And as a result, they are not in our churches.
[time=1787] I wonder if the blame isn't to be placed on those who are older.
[time=1791] Because maybe we have never taught them that song.
[time=1796] There is nothing impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=1802] Have you ever sung that song?
[time=1804] Some of you have.
[time=1806] And I think there's a song that we should be teaching our young people.
[time=1811] Because they're facing the impossible, I believe.
[time=1815] And as a result, they're not trusting in God because they do not know that we serve a God who works the impossible.
[time=1825] To show you that we have such a God, take your Bibles if you would, turn to Joshua the first chapter.
[time=1831] Joshua chapter one.
[time=1833] For in Joshua the first chapter, God places before the people of Israel an impossible situation.
[time=1840] We read about this in Joshua chapter one, looking at verse 10.
[time=1846] We're all the officers of the camp then are to go to the people and say, look, go throughout the camp and tell the people, you've got three days, three days, and we're over here.
[time=1862] We're gonna go from this side of the Jordan to the other side.
[time=1866] And we're going to go into the land that the Lord has promised us.
[time=1873] Three days and they have before them an impossible situation.
[time=1877] The impossible situation, of course, is the Jordan River.
[time=1881] And the question is this, how do you get from one side of the Jordan to the other side?
[time=1887] It's a real problem.
[time=1889] You say, well, I don't see the problem.
[time=1892] I mean, if you try to get from one side of a river to the other side, all you need to do is take a bridge.
[time=1898] Why didn't these people just go over the bridge?
[time=1902] But there's no bridge.
[time=1904] And so it's impossible.
[time=1906] You say, well, if there's no bridge, why didn't they just take the boat and go to the other side?
[time=1911] But there's a problem here too.
[time=1913] There is no boat.
[time=1916] You say, well, if I want to go to the other side of a river and there is no bridge, there is no boat.
[time=1922] What I do is I get an inner tube and I float.
[time=1926] Problem is no inner tubes.
[time=1929] The only other option is you swim.
[time=1933] But you know, I've stopped to think about this and wondered, I wonder if they even knew how to swim.
[time=1939] You see, we're talking about people who've been wandering out here in the wilderness.
[time=1944] And there's been a shortage of water.
[time=1947] In fact, so short, the God told Moses one time, look, you speak to this rock.
[time=1953] So that we cannot at least have enough water in which to drink.
[time=1957] So I don't think there were too many swimming holes.
[time=1960] And as a result, I don't think they learned how to swim and so there was some difficulty.
[time=1964] We had fathers and we had mothers and we have all these children.
[time=1968] And one more problem.
[time=1970] Turn a few wood to the third chapter, looking at verse 15.
[time=1973] Verse 15, we read, now the Jordan is at flood stage.
[time=1980] Oh, this is an impossible situation.
[time=1984] How do you get to the other side?
[time=1987] You can't cross a bridge, there's no boat.
[time=1989] You can't float, you can't swim.
[time=1992] And now there's a flood.
[time=1995] How do you get to the other side?
[time=1999] And I suppose there are times in which when we can't go any further and it looks impossible, there's only one thing to do and that is turn to the God who works the impossible.
[time=2015] And that's what he did for us.
[time=2016] We continue to read, notice what happened.
[time=2018] Verse 15, yet as soon as the priest who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge, the water from upstream stopped flowing.
[time=2029] In fact, the text goes on to say it all just piled up in a heap and the people walked across on dry ground.
[time=2037] You see, God does the impossible.
[time=2042] And I believe that even today, God continues to do the impossible and maybe you've seen that in your own life.
[time=2052] You're probably saying, well, we know this, we know this.
[time=2057] We have watched God work and work and work.
[time=2061] The impossible in our lives, but here's my concern.
[time=2065] My concern is, have we forgotten what he has done?
[time=2069] Have we forgotten and as a result, we have failed to pass it on to others, fathers, mothers.
[time=2077] Have you failed to pass this on to your children
[time=2086] so that you would tell them, look, God did the impossible in my life so that when they face the impossible, they will be able to say, look, we were raised on the stories of God doing the impossible.
[time=2102] Our problem is, is that we have a tendency to forget.
[time=2106] I don't know about you, but as I have tended to get older, one of the problems that I have is, is I can't remember anymore.
[time=2116] And maybe you're kind of like that today.
[time=2117] Maybe you'd be included with me as being kind of an old duffer who has trouble remembering what God has done.
[time=2128] University of Oregon had a great football season this year and they beat the fourth ranked team in the country.
[time=2138] It was a great game.
[time=2139] I remember listening to it on the radio thinking they'll probably lose it right at the end, but they won.
[time=2146] And after the game they interviewed the coach and he said this, this is the biggest win in my coaching memory, the biggest one.
[time=2158] But then he went on to say this, he said, but I am getting so old.
[time=2162] He said, I can't remember the other ones.
[time=2166] And I think that's sort of our problem, isn't it?
[time=2169] As we have tended to get old, we forget what God has done.
[time=2173] And because we forget, we forget to share.
[time=2176] And because we forget to share, we do not build into the memory bank of our children, those experiences.
[time=2183] And when they face the impossible, they look around and say, there is no one here to help.
[time=2192] I think God expected us to remember.
[time=2197] And so he came up with the plan.
[time=2199] The plan is seen now in the fourth chapter.
[time=2202] If you would look now beginning in the fourth chapter, the second verse.
[time=2206] God then told Joshua, you tell the people, go down to the river over here.
[time=2212] You pick up all of those rocks, those big rocks.
[time=2216] And what I want you to do is bring them up and pile in the place where we're going to stay this evening.
[time=2223] And they did this.
[time=2226] They took one man from each tribe.
[time=2228] They went down, picked up this rock.
[time=2230] They brought it up off the river bank.
[time=2232] They piled it where they stayed.
[time=2235] And God said, that's what I want.
[time=2238] You say, for what purpose?
[time=2239] I don't understand.
[time=2240] We'll look at verse six.
[time=2242] Because in verse six, he says, this will serve now as a sign among you.
[time=2249] So that in the future, when your children say, Dad, you tell me why all the rocks piled over here,
[time=2259] what you will say to your children is this, sit down.
[time=2262] Sit down.
[time=2264] I've got a story to tell you.
[time=2266] And you will tell them how God works the impossible.
[time=2272] I think there's the key right there.
[time=2277] There's the key.
[time=2278] We need a pile of rocks to remind us of what God has done in our lives.
[time=2289] I think if I could talk about the biggest mistake I made in raising my children, it was this.
[time=2296] I didn't pile up any rocks in the backyard.
[time=2300] I should have piled them up right there in the backyard, the middle of the backyard.
[time=2304] Every time God did something, you see, that was impossible.
[time=2309] So the later on when my boys would become about six years of age and they were out there playing baseball in the backyard and they'd say, Dad, I've got a question for you.
[time=2321] Why the pile of rocks over here?
[time=2323] Right in the middle of center field.
[time=2326] You know we can't play baseball back there.
[time=2329] It's this big pile of rocks.
[time=2331] Why the rocks, Dad?
[time=2333] And I'd say to my boys, sit down, sit down.
[time=2339] I've got a story to tell you.
[time=2341] And I'd begin to tell them how God has worked the impossible in my life and every time he did it, I took a rock and I took it to the backyard and I piled it up.
[time=2353] Or if I didn't do that, I should have maybe piled them up in the living room.
[time=2359] Good place.
[time=2361] You know, just a bunch of rocks right there.
[time=2363] I don't know, it wouldn't have to be in the center of the living room.
[time=2366] But maybe off on the side someplace, pile up some rocks.
[time=2369] You say, I don't like that idea.
[time=2371] Well, then polish the rocks, you know.
[time=2373] Get some nice rocks and put them there.
[time=2376] You say, I still don't like the idea.
[time=2378] But look, what's piled up in your living rooms right now?
[time=2383] Anyhow.
[time=2384] I mean, if you go to my house, you'll see a big stack of life magazines all piled up.
[time=2391] I mean, who really cares?
[time=2394] Why not pile up some rocks?
[time=2396] Make them beautiful.
[time=2397] So the later on, your children you see when they'd invite their friends over to the house and say, dad, you know, you're the only one with rocks in the living room.
[time=2407] They would say, dad, why the rocks?
[time=2412] And you would say, sit down, sit down.
[time=2415] I've got a story to tell you.
[time=2417] And if you don't like that idea, my suggestion is is why not take some rocks and pile them up in their bedroom?
[time=2424] I mean, there's a lot of stuff piled up in their bedrooms and you know it.
[time=2428] Why not just have some rocks?
[time=2431] Every time God does something of an impossible nature.
[time=2436] I know what you people are saying.
[time=2439] You're sitting there saying, this guy has rocks in his head.
[time=2443] But I wanna tell you something.
[time=2447] I didn't think up this scheme.
[time=2449] He was God and God said, pile up some rocks, you see,
[time=2455] so that we don't forget.
[time=2458] The question I have for you is this, has God worked the impossible in your life in the last year?
[time=2465] And I have to say in my own life, he has worked the impossible.
[time=2472] I've watched him work at Western Baptist College and it's just unbelievable what has taken place.
[time=2477] For nearly 20 years, we have had a program whereby we have always linked up with the state college and the state college always certified our students who are going to go out and teach in the public schools.
[time=2494] And one day I said, why can't the state certified us?
[time=2499] Why only the schools that they're working with?
[time=2505] And everybody looked at me and said, well, it's just impossible.
[time=2509] It's impossible, the state will never do this.
[time=2514] But you know I came to this conclusion, if it is God's will.
[time=2518] Nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=2523] And I said, I'm going down and I'm gonna speak to the state.
[time=2529] And they said, watch out, watch out.
[time=2531] The state answers to nobody, that's not true.
[time=2536] Have you ever read Romans the 13th chapter?
[time=2539] They answered a God, God has ordained all government.
[time=2544] You read also the book of Proverbs.
[time=2546] God does whatever he wishes with the king's heart.
[time=2549] If he wants to turn it this way, he turns it this way.
[time=2553] God worked that day when I went down there because when I left the state looked at me and we, they said this, we don't see any problem for you.
[time=2561] You go for it, you go for it.
[time=2563] We're behind you, there is nothing that should stop you.
[time=2567] We support you, it's impossible, impossible.
[time=2572] We've been sitting around for 20 years saying it was impossible.
[time=2577] But then we recognize no, God does work the impossible.
[time=2583] In the meantime, I started looking at a program that we did have with another school.
[time=2589] And they said, look, we will cooperate with you, but here are the conditions.
[time=2596] Our teachers will teach your students.
[time=2599] Number two, you have to come to Portland to do this.
[time=2603] We are 45 miles south of Portland.
[time=2606] And number three, we insist on having all the tuition money.
[time=2611] This was going to cost us $150,000 this year.
[time=2618] I gathered together educational people and I said this, here's my plan, I'd like to go to the most powerful man in the state.
[time=2625] A man who for 13 years was superintendent of schools.
[time=2629] And I'd like to go ahead and make this proposal and say to him, would you help us until we can get our program certified by the state?
[time=2640] And this is what I'd like.
[time=2641] We will do all the teaching.
[time=2644] It will all be done in Salem and not in your place.
[time=2647] And number three, we do not plan on giving you any money for it.
[time=2653] And the head of our education department looked at me and she said, that's ridiculous.
[time=2660] She said, I would never accept such an offer.
[time=2664] And I didn't exactly know what to say in that situation, but I looked at her and I said, well, you know, I'm not making you the offer.
[time=2673] And she kind of looked at me and she said, okay, crazy man, if you want to go and do it, try it, but I knew this if it is God's will, nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=2688] I walked into his office, made the proposal you looked at me and he said, we'd love to work with you.
[time=2696] I was so shocked, I really didn't know what to say.
[time=2699] I said, well, don't you think maybe we ought to write this up or something?
[time=2702] He looked at me and he says, good idea, good idea.
[time=2705] I said, would you like to write it up or would you like me to write it up?
[time=2708] And he really didn't know what to say, I don't think, and so he said, why don't you write it up?
[time=2714] And I wrote it up just the way I wanted it.
[time=2716] (audience laughing) And I came away just jumping for joy saying, look, nothing.
[time=2724] Nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=2729] I was so excited, I called a friend of mine in Pennsylvania, another one of Grand Rapids from a phone booth as I left the campus that day.
[time=2735] They both, as they talked to me, said, we don't believe this, there's got to be a catch someplace.
[time=2741] There is no catch.
[time=2743] God works the impossible.
[time=2747] We also had one other predicament on our campus this year and it is that we had a balloon payment due on our property of over a million dollars September the 15th.
[time=2760] Now, how do you come up with over a million dollars in a few short months?
[time=2768] I thought of calling Peter Koby here at the church and seeing if maybe he could help.
[time=2775] And then I thought that would just put us further in debt so I didn't even bother to call.
[time=2779] (audience laughing) Instead, however, I went to the banks and I made several presentations at banks and said, look, I need over a million dollars, I wanna tell you something, the banks are not real excited about loaning over a million dollars, many of the banks are in trouble themselves.
[time=2795] And besides that, they're not interested in a Baptist college.
[time=2800] I went to U.S. National and they kind of looked at me and laughed and said, we like you, but remember this.
[time=2805] We also had another Baptist college in this state that went out of business and guess who is holding the title.
[time=2814] We're trying to sell that property and we can't.
[time=2819] And every banker on the West Coast knows this.
[time=2823] What do you do?
[time=2824] It's an impossible situation.
[time=2825] I thought our only other step was to go to savings and law, speak to them.
[time=2831] So I called the savings and loans said, like talk to you, they said, look, we're out of business, the government has taken us over, you recall that story.
[time=2838] I thought, well, what do I do now?
[time=2841] I thought of calling the president of the United States.
[time=2844] But then I realized his son was in the midst of a scandal of the savings and loan company.
[time=2849] So I figured he wouldn't even wanna talk, so I didn't bother to call.
[time=2853] Just pray, that's all.
[time=2855] And I knew this, if it is God's will, nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=2863] We kept saying to the savings and loan company, look, if anybody comes from Washington, D.C., we want to talk to them.
[time=2871] And they said, nobody's coming, we don't even know who to talk to.
[time=2875] But all of a sudden one day they said, look, somebody will be here.
[time=2878] We said, could we get an appointment?
[time=2882] They said, we'll try.
[time=2884] So they tried on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and every day, you see, we were calling back, finally, Friday.
[time=2892] We called and they said, okay, okay, we'll get you an appointment, but we wanna say one thing to you, you are wasting your time.
[time=2899] But just remember this, if it is God's will, nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=2908] And we went down, made the presentation, 10 minutes into the discussion, a man, to whom we had not been introduced, all of a sudden said, look, how fast can you get the people down here to sign the papers?
[time=2920] This is what we'd like to do.
[time=2920] We'd like to extend this for 15 years.
[time=2922] We'd like to keep it, you see, at the same interest, right?
[time=2925] No refinancing charges.
[time=2926] It will lower your payment, $3,000 a month.
[time=2929] Are you interested?
[time=2931] And I wanna tell you, we were interested and we signed.
[time=2935] Only to find out that the very next day, the whole thing was sold to somebody else.
[time=2940] We had a little window in which to work, but God was at work.
[time=2945] I've walked away from this year saying this, nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=2954] We had one other problem and that is we had budgeted for 20 extra students this next year.
[time=2960] But then we began to read Chronicle of Higher Education, USA Today and all the papers said the same thing.
[time=2967] All private schools would be down in enrollment.
[time=2971] We couldn't afford to be down.
[time=2972] So we prayed again, we knew this.
[time=2975] If it is God's will, nothing is impossible.
[time=2979] In other words, we will go contrary to all the statistics.
[time=2984] Nothing is impossible if we put our trust in God.
[time=2989] And the year started and we had our 20 students.
[time=2992] Not only 20, we had 30, in fact 40.
[time=2995] Actually, the final toll is we had 58 extra students than the previous year, that's impossible.
[time=3003] It's impossible for a small, private college.
[time=3007] When the school year began, I stood in chapel one day and I told the students all that had just happened.
[time=3014] But then this is what I said to them.
[time=3018] I said, I'll probably forget this in the next six months.
[time=3023] I probably will forget it by the time another class rolls around the following year.
[time=3028] I won't remember this.
[time=3029] Unless, of course, I asked the maintenance crew at the college to get me some big rocks and pile them up right there on the campus.
[time=3039] And what will happen is, is that as the students come for the next 20 years or so, they will say, why the rocks over here?
[time=3048] And I will say to them, sit down.
[time=3053] Sit down.
[time=3054] I've got a story to tell you.
[time=3057] I think it's a great plan, back.
[time=3060] I think you ought to do it in your backyards.
[time=3063] I think you even should do it.
[time=3065] You see in the front of this church, just pile up some rocks so that when people come to this church and say, why the rocks?
[time=3074] Right there in my parking spot.
[time=3077] You could say something like this, sit down.
[time=3080] Sit down, I've got a story to tell you.
[time=3082] And you can tell them of the last 20 years of how God has worked the impossible here at this church.
[time=3089] You see, that's crazy, but ladies may not be as crazy
[time=3095] as you think because if you look right there on your finger, what do you see?
[time=3100] And most of you, well, what do you know?
[time=3103] You carry one with you all the time, a rock.
[time=3106] You carry one there to remind you of who you are.
[time=3113] I just had my 50th birthday.
[time=3116] And after I preached this sermon, they brought a big cake out one day, candles all over the place, and guess what else, on the top of the cake?
[time=3127] Some rocks, yeah.
[time=3130] In fact, printed in the icing where these words are reaching another milestone.
[time=3137] (audience laughing) And then my boys, guess what they got me for my birthday.
[time=3143] Yeah, you guessed it, a big rock that they found on the campus.
[time=3147] In fact, they found some of my paint, they painted two stick figures, something from the book of Joshua, and then they said, "You are a rock solid dad." And so I took the rock home and it's right there as you come to my front door.
[time=3163] And if you were to ever come to my house and say, "Whoa, why the rock?" You know what I'd say to you?
[time=3170] Sit out, sit out.
[time=3173] I've got a story to tell you, and I'd tell you of how God has done that be impossible.
[time=3179] And if you don't like my idea of rocks, then I have a suggestion for you.
[time=3186] If something comes your way, whether it's by a picture, a report, or an important document, frame it.
[time=3192] Frame it and put it on the wall someplace.
[time=3196] In fact, that's exactly what I've been doing.
[time=3199] I've been collecting all of these things.
[time=3201] Here's something from the Office of Educational Policy and Planning.
[time=3205] I'm going to frame this thing.
[time=3207] I'm gonna put it in my office.
[time=3209] And when the students come in, they'll look at this and they'll say, "What is this?" And you know what I'm gonna say?
[time=3216] Sit out, sit out, and I've got a story to tell you, and I'll tell them quite a story of how God has worked the impossible.
[time=3224] Here's a statement of agreement with the college that I was telling you about, to save us $150,000, the one I wrote up.
[time=3232] And then here's the man I went to speak to and his signatures, right?
[time=3236] I'm gonna frame this thing.
[time=3237] I'm gonna put it right there in my office.
[time=3239] And when the students walk in, they'll say, "What's this?" And I will say to them, "Sit down." I've got a story to tell you.
[time=3250] Oh, here's what I'm gonna frame.
[time=3251] I haven't told you this one.
[time=3254] We borrowed $100,000 from somebody to help us get through some tough times.
[time=3262] And then all of a sudden, they called one day and said, "Look, we need our money back.
[time=3268] We need that $100,000." Now tell me, how do you just come up with $100,000 overnight?
[time=3276] I mean, frankly, you know, if we didn't need $100,000, we wouldn't have borrowed the $100,000.
[time=3282] It's an impossible situation.
[time=3284] He wants his money, and he wants it now.
[time=3288] And so the secretary did the president, she prayed.
[time=3292] She prayed the very day we got the phone call before she opened the mail.
[time=3298] And as she opened the mail, there was a check in there for $100,000.
[time=3304] It doesn't come every day.
[time=3307] We've never seen a check for $100,000.
[time=3309] Here's one, I've blown it up.
[time=3311] I'm going to put it, you see, right there in my office.
[time=3314] I'm gonna frame it.
[time=3314] And when the students come in and say, "What's this?" Thinking maybe it is my monthly salary, I am going to say, "Sit down." I've got a story to tell you.
[time=3326] And I'll tell 'em how God works the impossible.
[time=3331] And then here's one with respect to our loan.
[time=3334] And then here's one newspaper article on our enrollment.
[time=3340] And then here's one.
[time=3341] We just put out a news release because the state just said this.
[time=3345] The state said, "We unanimously approve "your teacher ed program.
[time=3351] "We can certify you, you need not work with anybody else."
[time=3357] That's an impossible situation.
[time=3359] In fact, the state wrote, and they said, "You have done such a fine job.
[time=3363] "We will use it as a model for other schools." Imagine that.
[time=3369] Little Western Baptist College, being a model, even for the state schools.
[time=3376] I say that's impossible.
[time=3378] But nothing is impossible if you put your trust in God.
[time=3384] Now, my suggestion is you ought to do the same thing.
[time=3391] Frame some of these things.
[time=3392] And I hate to tell you this, being the first time visitor in this church, that have you ever noticed the walls of this church?
[time=3399] They're a little on the bare side.
[time=3401] (audience laughing) Have you ever thought about taking some pictures and documents, putting your frame around them, and then putting them right there on the wall?
[time=3410] You say, "I don't like that idea, all right." Then at least find a room someplace so that we never forget.
[time=3418] The other day a girl came up to me in the hall and she said this to me.
[time=3422] She said, "Guess what?" I said, "What?" She said, "We just put a rock in the locker room." I knew what she was talking about.
[time=3432] They just had an impossible season.
[time=3434] Here are a group of girls that weren't supposed to do very well, but a bunch of girls had a great testimony.
[time=3441] They had their pictures in the program, their testimony written out, and when they were introduced, they ran across to the other team.
[time=3447] They gave them this program, went out, and then beat them.
[time=3450] And then all the coaches of the area voted our coach, the district coach of the year.
[time=3456] Question, are you facing the impossible?
[time=3461] You got any rivers you think are encrossable?
[time=3465] Any mountains that you can't tunnel through?
[time=3470] God special licenses and things thought impossible.
[time=3474] - We've been sharing with you music today
[time=3484] from our men's chorus, celebration, and a solo by Lisa Renicker.
[time=3488] The message was from our special guest, Dr. David Miller, president of Western Baptist College in Salem, Oregon.
[time=3495] If as a result of this program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3504] Will you bow and pray with me?
[time=3506] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3514] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3517] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3522] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3526] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3530] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3539] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the booklet entitled Relationships, please write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East-State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
