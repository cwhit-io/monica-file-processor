[time=103] Welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=105] The Bible Hour began in 1974 under the auspices of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, and we've had two very fine pastor teachers included in our presentations of the Bible Hour.
[time=117] We began with Dr. David Jeremiah, and then most recently, Pastor Rick Hawks.
[time=122] And today we have the special privilege of introducing to you our new pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=128] We'll have some music this morning, but we'll have an extended message from our new pastor.
[time=132] I hope that you'll remain with us for the entire broadcast.
[time=135] Join us please for this special edition of the Bible Hour.
[time=140] [MUSIC]
[time=151] Welcome to an hour of Bible Studied Music and Fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=156] Thank you for joining us.
[time=158] As Peter Kobe just mentioned, this is a very special day in the history of the Bible Hour and the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=166] Today, Russell Moore becomes Black Hawk's new senior pastor, culminating a search process which began over one year ago.
[time=174] In this his first message to his new congregation, Pastor Moore will be speaking from Psalms Chapter 126
[time=181] on the subject the Lord has done great things.
[time=185] Before his message, we will hear special music from Reflection, the hand bell choir playing a mighty fortress, the sanctuary choir singing upon this rock, and a solo by Marilyn Wong entitled "I Am Not A Shame."
[time=204] Let's join today's service as Reflection sings the song "I Am."
[time=210] [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=358] (audience applauding)
[time=369] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour Today.
[time=372] This is a special broadcast, as I mentioned early in the program, a very special day in the life of Blackhawk Baptist Church and the Bible Hour.
[time=380] We wanna welcome today our new pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=384] In fact, he's with me today in the studio, so welcome to you, Russ, it's nice to have you here.
[time=388] - Thank you very much, Peter.
[time=389] We are so happy to be here.
[time=391] It's almost as if we're in a dream.
[time=392] It's everything's going so well.
[time=394] - Well, it seemed like since March 24th, it's been a long time, but here it is, and we're just delighted that you came, and are going to be with us for eternity, really, and as long as the Lord terries, we hope that God will use you here in a mighty way at Blackhawk and on the Bible Hour.
[time=411] You came in last Sunday night.
[time=413] We were excited about the trip because many of our people joined with us at the Bearfield Airport, and Russ, you were supposed to come in around 10, 15 or so, and things got delayed a little bit, but that's all right, the action of the crowd just escalated, and I think you arrived our time about 11, 15.
[time=432] We're gonna show a little clip of what happened, and what took place as Russell and Heidi, and their family joined us here at Bearfield last Sunday evening.
[time=443] Here we are, we had many signs and banners, balloons, welcoming them.
[time=446] There were about 200 of our congregation there waiting patiently.
[time=451] We had some short and some tall people, some brought ladders so they could see some great signs that came, and in a moment, you're going to see Russ and Heidi.
[time=460] I know that was a long trip for you, Russ.
[time=462] - We started pretty early in the day.
[time=464] - We did, and the flight left Los Angeles about an hour late, and we finally made it into O'Hare, and it was because of my eldest daughter, Randy, that we literally scurried through the airport there to catch this connecting flight, which is why we made it that night.
[time=478] Coming around the corner there and walking up, I can see everybody in the end of the hallway is just choked with people from Blackhawk, and they're at this point, yelling, and screaming, and cheering, and you just have to put your, I had to put my hand, I didn't know what else to do, it was just overwhelming.
[time=492] - Well, I know Whitney had a long trip that's your youngest daughter, but her eyes were just as big as all the rest of the girls.
[time=498] - Yeah, I tell you, I've never had an experience like that in all my life, a feeling of being loved and appreciated and welcomed that surpasses any I've ever known.
[time=508] - Oh Russ, as you can see there, the hug by I.E., the top below, that was genuine, and our love for you, just that's just the beginning of it.
[time=515] We're just excited really about our people and their enthusiasm for the ministry that you're going to have here at Blackhawk and on the Bible Hour.
[time=524] There you are meeting a number of our people and everybody, in spite of the lateness of the hour, it was just really excited that you arrive safely in Fort Wayne, along with Heidi, and Randy, and Nikki, and Kelly, and Whitney.
[time=539] They're all here this morning, and I'm just really glad for that.
[time=542] So we welcome you today to the Bible Hour.
[time=545] I know that our people are excited, and I know we've been announcing that you're going to be on the Bible Hour as our regular pastor teacher, and I know there are folks out there that are excited too.
[time=555] - Peter, it's a privilege to know that the ministry of the Word of God will not only impact the immediate family of Blackhawk, but to serve and to be a part of what the Bible Hour is doing in all of your lives.
[time=566] And I know as I've thought about coming to Blackhawk, the privilege of ministering the Word of God through the television ministry on the Bible Hour has really excited my heart.
[time=576] And I look forward to many, many weeks and months and years together as we study God's Word.
[time=582] - Oh, we look forward to your message in just a few moments.
[time=585] Oh, we're talking about a relationship with the Moore family and our congregation here at Blackhawk and the Bible Hour family.
[time=592] I want to tell you about a booklet that we're advertising this month entitled Relationships by Pamela Reeves.
[time=598] It's a great booklet that just talks about how we can build a strong relationship between our family members and other friends that we have.
[time=607] And I hope that you'll write for it today.
[time=608] You can receive it absolutely free by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=619] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=628] Well, please stay with us now for some more music and then the message from our pastor Russell Moore.
[time=634] Stay tuned, please.
[time=636] (gentle music)
[time=743] (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=753] (gentle music)
[time=783] (gentle music) (audience applauding)
[time=802] (gentle music)
[time=947] (gentle music) (gentle music) (gentle music)
[time=974] (gentle music)
[time=1446] (applause)
[time=1455] Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=1457] Again, I want to say thank you for all the people that helped in preparing for this day.
[time=1461] Jill and Ken, nor Marge Mead.
[time=1463] As I mentioned, the Griggs and all the musicians who worked hard, you see me smile in front of them in most cases on Sunday mornings.
[time=1471] It's not always, I don't always smile at them when we're rehearsing.
[time=1475] They were patient and worked so hard, and I really do appreciate our musicians and the ministry that they give to Blackhawk Baptist Church Sunday after Sunday.
[time=1484] And we're certainly glad that you're here.
[time=1486] Many of you know that in 1969, Blackhawk began across the street in a double-wide trailer.
[time=1492] Pastor Jeremiah came and stayed here a number of years and started the Christian school.
[time=1498] We started the living Christmas tree and the Super '60s program with the help of George Lattman.
[time=1505] In 1981, Pastor Jeremiah resigned and moved on to alcohol at the Scott Memorial Baptist Church where he's presently pastoring.
[time=1514] And Rick became our interim.
[time=1516] And then finally, in 1983, he joined the staff here as the senior pastor and led us to great things in those eight years that he was here in particular this building.
[time=1526] And we're really grateful for that.
[time=1528] This is an opportunity, again, and it's unique in the life of Blackhawk Baptist Church because we have not had the opportunity to introduce new senior pastors.
[time=1537] Before I introduce our pastor, however, I want the most important part of the family and undoubtedly the best-looking part of the family to stand and I want you to greet them, first of all, Heidi.
[time=1548] And then Randy.
[time=1550] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1557] And then Nikki.
[time=1559] And finally, Kelly.
[time=1561] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1573] Whitney is not feeling well today and is being cared for, I believe, in the nursery.
[time=1578] At this juncture in the life of our church, it would be easy for us to look back and marvel at what God has done and the people that he's given to us here at Blackhawk.
[time=1587] But we must look ahead.
[time=1589] I personally have great expectations for Blackhawk.
[time=1593] My optimism is based on many evidences.
[time=1596] Most of my excitement today is based on the fact that we have a new senior pastor.
[time=1601] It's an unspeakable blessing right now to be living and to be a part of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1607] Today, it's a great privilege to know Christ and to be identified with His people.
[time=1612] And as we welcome Russell Moore to our pulpit here at Blackhawk, let us join together in new areas of service that are more encompassing than they've ever been before.
[time=1622] It's my privilege and pleasure to welcome our new pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=1628] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1657] Thank you very much.
[time=1665] I'm wondering if I'm going to make it through this morning without bursting into tears.
[time=1669] The emotion has just been welling up all week long.
[time=1674] And this is a beautiful day, weather-wise, as well as the expression of love that is being extended to my family and me this morning.
[time=1684] It's amazing. Thank you very, very much.
[time=1689] Yeah, this is a pulpit.
[time=1695] It's May 19th.
[time=1698] I'm supposed to say something.
[time=1703] It's almost like a dream, I guess, is the best way to put it.
[time=1708] I've been feeling that way, as I know my wife has, for the last several weeks, months.
[time=1714] We didn't know we were going to come here.
[time=1716] We didn't know this is what God had in store for us.
[time=1719] The first time we heard the idea of Indiana, our immediate reaction was negative.
[time=1725] [laughter] We had been to Indiana on several other occasions, one which sticks out on our minds very clearly over in Bremen.
[time=1733] Is that right? Bremen, Indiana.
[time=1735] We were doing a wedding there for a graduate of the Masters College, and it was a cold, cold, I think it was November.
[time=1742] And we were freezing, and in this little car lost, trying to get to where we were supposed to be.
[time=1748] And I looked over at Heidi and I said, "Honey, aren't you glad we don't live in Indiana?" [laughter] And she said, "Oh, yes." And I said, "We will never leave California." That's the truth, but we are so glad we live in Indiana today.
[time=1767] I can't tell you, everything is different now about Indiana because of you people, and because of this church.
[time=1775] We're thankful for our home, we're thankful for Sarah Langis, and for the help that she has been to us,
[time=1781] and the way that God has miraculously opened up this little place that we're leasing until our house in California cells over in Arlington Park.
[time=1788] It's perfect. We're thankful for all the blessings, but you know what makes this thing happen for us as you.
[time=1796] The unbelievable warmth that we just keep pouring into our lives from the very first minute there at the airport
[time=1804] when several hundred of you choked the hall and almost got Pete Coby thrown out of the airport
[time=1810] because you kept pushing him past that no barrier, you know, where you can't go because you don't have a ticket.
[time=1816] And we rounded that corner and looked down that hall and there you were.
[time=1820] And you began to cheer, and applaud, and your signs, and your banners, and you eventually sang, and I'll tell you,
[time=1828] it's hard to comprehend all this stuff, and I'm sitting here this morning and I'm realizing all the work that's gone into today,
[time=1834] and it's everything a person like me could ever dream of.
[time=1838] I come from a big church there at Grace Community Church.
[time=1841] There have been some spectacular days in the life of that church. I haven't seen one that can match what you folks are doing here this morning,
[time=1848] and I, you know, I don't deserve that stuff.
[time=1851] It's just hard. It's really, really significant.
[time=1862] I won't say thank you. Thank you very much.
[time=1867] I'm still supposed to say something, weren't I here today?
[time=1870] Why don't you open your Bibles to Psalm? Psalms 126.
[time=1878] If I keep going this way, Brian Carlson's going to have to loan me one of his handkerchiefs.
[time=1892] He's a neighbor now. I can say those things in public about it.
[time=1896] There are some people that we're going to look at this morning who we're feeling.
[time=1900] I think much the same way out of way, Brian. Get up here.
[time=1904] Where do you put this?
[time=1920] There are some people in this psalm that we're going to look at this morning that are feeling a little bit like they're in a dream
[time=1926] because of the things that God has done in their life.
[time=1930] Let me read these first couple of verses. Psalm 126.
[time=1935] When the Lord brought back the captive ones of Zion, we were like those who dream.
[time=1941] Then our mouth was filled with laughter in our tongue with joyful shouting.
[time=1947] Then they said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them.
[time=1952] The Lord has done great things for us, and we are glad."
[time=1958] They thought they were in a dream. They were waiting for somebody to pinch them and wake them up.
[time=1963] It was too good to be true. It just couldn't be this good is what they were saying.
[time=1969] You see, they were the exiles who had been taken into the Babylonian captivity.
[time=1974] They had been there for a long time, but suddenly, almost out of nowhere, Cyrus,
[time=1980] who was in control of the empire at that time, gave a decree.
[time=1984] You could read it, we won't turn there, Ezra chapter 1.
[time=1987] Basically, it was unheard of that he should do such a thing.
[time=1991] Cyrus said to the people of Israel, "You may now go home to Jerusalem." Any and all of you who'd like to go, you may go.
[time=2000] When you get there, I want you to rebuild the temple, your temple, and I'll pay for it.
[time=2007] We'll take the money right out of my treasury to do it.
[time=2011] To ensure that once you've arrived there and your temple is rebuilt, that you can worship the way you want to worship, the way it was supposed to be, I'm going to find the vessels that were taken by Nebuchadnezzar from your kingdom some 70 years before and rip right out of your temple.
[time=2026] I'm going to find him somewhere in this kingdom, I'm going to give him back to you.
[time=2031] And then he said, "For those of you who choose to remain, those of you of the nation of Israel who choose to remain, why don't you all take up an offering and give it to these folks who are going back to the homeland so that their traveling can be expedited?" When they got that news, they couldn't handle it.
[time=2052] They thought they were in a dream.
[time=2054] When they opened their mouth, laughter came out.
[time=2057] When they began to use their tongue, they shouted words of joy because it was just too much to handle. They couldn't believe it.
[time=2065] You see, they'd lost hope.
[time=2068] They'd been for it there for about 70 years.
[time=2071] And it was a hard 70 years.
[time=2075] You can turn over to Psalm 137 and listen to their words as they lament the loss of their homeland and Jerusalem.
[time=2085] Psalm 137, "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept.
[time=2090] There's weren't tears of joy. There's were tears of sorrow." When we remembered Zion upon the willows in the midst of it, we hung our harps.
[time=2100] For there are captors demanded of us songs and our tormentors, from earth saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
[time=2109] How can we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?
[time=2114] If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget her skill.
[time=2119] May my tongue cleave the roof of my mouth. If I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy." Their hearts were filled with sorrow. They knew well the policy of Eastern powers
[time=2134] that had long been established and practiced.
[time=2138] They would move into a tribe or a kingdom and they would conquer, and then they would deport the more able and capable of its leadership.
[time=2146] Sometimes thousands of people would be taken out of that homeland.
[time=2149] Whatever it took to strip that conquered nation of its leadership, they would bring them into the Eastern powers dynasty where they would stay forever and ever and ever.
[time=2160] This is the first time in the history of the Eastern dynasties that a ruler has ever given permission for its people to return back to its homeland.
[time=2170] This was unexpected. This was sudden.
[time=2173] This was bigger and far beyond anything they ever could have hoped for.
[time=2179] It was a dream. It was like a dream.
[time=2183] When they opened their mouths, laughter just came bursting forth.
[time=2186] They couldn't believe God had been so good. The Lord has done great things for us.
[time=2193] This is not the only great deliverance recorded for us in the scriptures.
[time=2197] We think of the Exodus.
[time=2200] And many times the Exodus gets better press because it was full of miracles.
[time=2206] The direct intervention of God upon the laws of nature.
[time=2211] He turned the Nile to blood. He made the dust of the ground turn into gnats.
[time=2218] He brought three days of supernatural darkness and other plagues that could be mentioned.
[time=2223] As a result, it's a spectacular moment in the life of Israel.
[time=2227] It's clearly the more spectacular of the two deliverances.
[time=2232] What I like about the one we're thinking about this morning, as those exiles were freed from Babylon, is that it displays a side of our God that is so marvelous.
[time=2242] I like to call it His quiet sovereignty, the quiet sovereignty of God.
[time=2248] You realize that for these people, the exiles in Babylon, God had been just as committed to them as He had His children in Egypt.
[time=2257] He had been just as hard at work.
[time=2260] This wasn't miraculously shown.
[time=2264] From the moment that Nebuchadnezzar came in 605 BC to take away the people,
[time=2270] God knew that He was going to eventually, through Nebuchadnezzar's successors, raise up Cyrus, the man who eventually gave this decree.
[time=2278] Cyrus was a remarkable man.
[time=2281] It was out of his heart that God worked this miracle, if you will.
[time=2287] And think with me for a minute about the components of the decree.
[time=2291] Why would a man like Cyrus, as unique as he was, ever think to return the people so that they could do that one most fundamental thing in the history of all of Israel, and that would be to rebuild the temple?
[time=2302] And then to say he'd fund it.
[time=2305] And then to say, I'll make sure you get your vessels back.
[time=2308] Why would an unregenerate heathen man have those as his priority?
[time=2315] Well, again, the quiet sovereignty of God is on display.
[time=2318] Many people, and I'm one of them, think the reason that decree held those vital elements is because Daniel wrote it.
[time=2326] Remember Daniel so many years prior?
[time=2329] He had been taken to Babylon, and God had given him grace, and he was a man who'd purposed in his own heart to follow God.
[time=2335] And through all of the dynasties, Daniel had remained in place and intact and in leadership.
[time=2340] And now, under Cyrus, he was one of three presidents.
[time=2343] One of three presidents that Cyrus had established to oversee the 120 provinces of the whole known world at that time.
[time=2352] I believe Daniel wrote that decree.
[time=2354] I believe it reflects his heart, his understanding of the ways and the will of God.
[time=2360] The quiet, yet very powerful, sovereignty of God.
[time=2366] I believe that's the case at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2370] I believe that God has been at work, and to my knowledge, the water hasn't turned to blood around here.
[time=2375] The dust hasn't turned to gnats.
[time=2378] There are a lot of bugs here.
[time=2380] But I don't know that that's the product of a direct miracle.
[time=2385] To my knowledge, the earth hasn't shaken as it did at Mount Sinai when God gave birth to the nation of Israel.
[time=2392] But God has nevertheless been very much at work here.
[time=2396] Quietly, powerfully, faithfully, consistently.
[time=2401] I don't think that Tom Younger knew, I guess 1969, when he picked up the phone
[time=2409] and called a guy by the name of David Jeremiah.
[time=2412] What would come of that phone call?
[time=2414] I don't think they knew.
[time=2415] I don't think they had any understanding.
[time=2417] In fact, I had lunch with David Jeremiah before I left California.
[time=2420] It was a wonderful time.
[time=2422] And he still calls it the Blackhawk experiment.
[time=2427] He didn't understand.
[time=2429] Tom didn't understand, but God knew.
[time=2432] God knew why.
[time=2435] God knew how.
[time=2438] 14 years ago, when a very gifted and able man of God by the name of Rick Hawks came to this church to serve you as your junior high pastor, he didn't understand.
[time=2447] You didn't know, nobody knew that he would eventually be your senior pastor and lead you through some strategic and fruitful and powerful and gracious years.
[time=2458] When Peter Coby showed up for the first time talking about a living Christmas tree, who would have known that God would take that simple idea and turn it into the pride
[time=2470] and joy of this church and have thousands and thousands and thousands of people come
[time=2476] into this place every single year to either worship their Savior or be introduced to their Savior.
[time=2484] Nobody knew.
[time=2485] Nobody knew that's what would happen.
[time=2487] That's where that little idea would go.
[time=2491] 18 years ago, when the idea of a Christian school was presented and it started,
[time=2497] I guess it opened its doors with 39 students and four teachers.
[time=2503] Nobody knew what God would do.
[time=2507] Incredible ministry that's going on across the street, the faculty, the staff.
[time=2513] Nobody knew God was going to bring a godly man like Steve Longbreak to lead that thing.
[time=2519] Have you heard the news, the big news this week?
[time=2522] Nobody knew 18 years ago when this church was, excuse me, when the school was given birth
[time=2530] that somebody would write a letter that was received on Tuesday and I know about it because Steve called me and said, "I'm sorry to bother you.
[time=2537] I know you're moving in today, but I had to tell you this." I said, "What?" He said, "I got a letter." And the letter said this and closed as a check to be used in whatever way the leaders of Blackhawk Christian school deemed to be necessary.
[time=2551] How much the check was for?
[time=2554] $150,000.
[time=2558] [AMEN] Nobody knew.
[time=2562] That's a little louder sovereignty of God, but it's still in the category of the quiet sovereignty of God.
[time=2570] Realize the person who gave this gift who wants to remain anonymous and will, but in a general sense you know they don't go to this church.
[time=2578] They don't have children in that school.
[time=2581] They just heard about what's going on, they want to support it, they want to give to it.
[time=2586] Praise God.
[time=2589] God's been at work here.
[time=2592] In a very quiet, but a very powerful way.
[time=2596] You want to know why?
[time=2599] And this blows me away.
[time=2602] This chatter is all my categories.
[time=2605] When you think about it, you want to know why God has been at work here.
[time=2608] You want to know why this building exists, and the one across the street, and the Awana program, and the youth ministry, and the ABS, and all the others that we could list, the super 60s, and the ones that you're in that I haven't.
[time=2620] You know why those are here today?
[time=2622] Because God loves you.
[time=2626] That's why.
[time=2629] God's in love with you.
[time=2631] He's so excited about you, he can't stand it.
[time=2634] He made a promise.
[time=2636] It's one of my favorite verses, "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[time=2642] which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."
[time=2648] The word "workmanship" could have been translated masterpiece.
[time=2651] It's as if somebody's painted a painting, and it's the best one that was ever done.
[time=2655] That's what you are in Christ.
[time=2658] And He is now in the consistent and faithful process of bringing you in to all that He has created you to be in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2665] And He needs this church to do it in your life.
[time=2668] That's why this church is here.
[time=2671] It's interesting this verse says that He prepared all this stuff from beforehand, from before the foundation of the world.
[time=2678] God had purposed in His heart not only to redeem you, and to bring you into Christ, and to create you into a masterpiece, but to bring all this stuff about so that you have a place to come on Sunday morning and worship your God, and you have a place during the week to come and be instructed, to learn, and to be held together by the strength of the family of God.
[time=2698] Blackhawk, Baptist Church is the bride of Christ.
[time=2702] It's for the glory of God, but it's His vehicle in your life.
[time=2707] He loves you.
[time=2709] He wants to continue to minister to you through this church.
[time=2715] So back there in Psalm 126 we see or have seen those first three verses.
[time=2722] They think they're in a dream.
[time=2724] They can't stand it. God's too good.
[time=2727] It's doing too much. It's overwhelming.
[time=2730] When I open my mouth, laughter just comes out.
[time=2734] When I use my tongue, it's full of joyful shouting.
[time=2737] And look at it there in verse two.
[time=2739] They say among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them." These are the heathen nations.
[time=2744] These are the nations that are looking on with amazement, that it's Israel, the one that's going back and getting to rebuild or temple.
[time=2751] And then they finally agree, "Yes, verse three, the Lord has done great things for us."
[time=2757] And we're glad.
[time=2760] You can't stand it. It's too good.
[time=2765] That's the praise.
[time=2767] If you were going to divide the Psalm up, you'd find the praise in verses one, two, and three.
[time=2771] Now let's look at the prayer.
[time=2774] Verses four, five, and six, the prayer.
[time=2777] They cry out, "Restore our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
[time=2783] Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting.
[time=2787] He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying his bag of seed shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves with him." This is their prayer.
[time=2798] What do they mean?
[time=2799] "Restore our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south." As they returned from Babylon, they come to a city that is very much different than the one they remembered or had heard of.
[time=2810] Jerusalem doesn't look like it used to.
[time=2813] It had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, and only the feeble had been left, and they had not kept their land.
[time=2819] It was unkept and unproductive, and it was discouraging.
[time=2823] And it reminded them of the south, the streams in the south.
[time=2826] That's a reference to the Negev. It's in southern Judea.
[time=2831] It's a place without natural water. It's a place without natural springs.
[time=2834] And so when summer comes and there is no rain, the place just dries up.
[time=2840] The scorching, blazing heat of a relentless summer sun, bakes the riverbeds until they crack, and turns everything as dry as it can be, and it reminds them of their current situation as they return to their homeland.
[time=2853] And their expectations were so high that they look at it and go, "Oh, my lands, what is before us?" And so they cry out in a prayer that God should restore our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
[time=2867] And then a beautiful picture comes into view. That of a farmer.
[time=2872] Look at verse 5, "Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting."
[time=2878] You've got a picture of a farmer, and he's out in one of these fields.
[time=2883] And he's working, and he's weeping, and he's waiting.
[time=2895] He's working because there's much to be done. The land is in disrepair, and the days are hard, and they're long.
[time=2905] And you notice he's weeping. We don't know exactly why.
[time=2909] Maybe it's just out of discouragement, looking at how the promised land is falling apart.
[time=2915] But I'll suggest there's an indication here that what he is sowing is corn. Corn has a unique quality to it.
[time=2922] It's either something you can eat or something you can plant.
[time=2926] And when you don't have much food, and you're an agrarian community, and you've just returned back to Jerusalem,
[time=2932] and the land is unkempt, and it's unproductive, and there isn't any food, and there aren't any supermarkets, and all you've got is a little bit of corn.
[time=2939] To take that corn into your hand and throw it into the ground is to take it out of one of your children's mouths.
[time=2945] And they begin to experience the trauma and the reality of coming back to the homeland, and so the farmer,
[time=2951] he's out in his field, and he's working, and he's weeping, and he's waiting.
[time=2958] He's waiting because he doesn't know what God is going to do with his corn.
[time=2964] He has no idea. He must wait upon God.
[time=2970] And I think about that in relationship to our new beginning and our new relationship.
[time=2975] And we're overjoyed. It's like a dream.
[time=2980] And we open our mouths and laughter comes out. I can't tell you how many times this week I've just had to laugh.
[time=2984] I mean, there was so much emotion I just had to do something. It's better than crying.
[time=2991] But you know, as we face this new beginning, if you will, there's much work to be done, isn't there?
[time=2997] There are a lot of lives that need to be touched. A lot of people on your street who don't know Jesus Christ just yet.
[time=3004] And there's a lot of people where you work, who need to see and feel the love of Jesus Christ through you.
[time=3012] And even within our family, this is a big family. There's a lot of folks here that need to be discipled.
[time=3018] There's a lot of folks here that need you to come into their life and set aside some other pursuits and interests and say,
[time=3024] "I want to give myself to you. I want to invest myself in you." A lot of ministry to be done. A lot of investment to make.
[time=3034] So they'll be work and they'll no doubt be some weeping.
[time=3038] It won't all go perfectly smooth.
[time=3041] There'll be times when we find ourselves in James chapter 1, wondering why this trial is here.
[time=3047] And we'll be trying to hold each other up to count it all joy.
[time=3050] But the reality is, there'll be days where in your life and my life the discouragement and the hardship and the reality of trying to advance the kingdom of God on the sin curse planet will be hard and will weep together.
[time=3064] We'll cry out to God, restore, restore, bring again new and fresh grace that we might accomplish the task.
[time=3072] And they'll be waiting. We'll wait together.
[time=3076] We don't know what the next 10, 20 years holds, do we?
[time=3080] We have no idea what God has in mind for us.
[time=3084] And so like the farmer, we'll move off into our field and we'll sow and we'll weep and we'll wait.
[time=3094] Wait for what God will do.
[time=3097] But notice verse 6.
[time=3101] In other words, there's no question about the fact that this farmer is coming back and when he comes, he'll bring his sheaves with him.
[time=3123] And it forces us to face the reality that the farmer ultimately pictured in this psalm is none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=3132] For he shall come again. He shall come again. Indeed, he shall come again.
[time=3140] Jesus is the one who has gone off into the field of humanity, if you will, to sow the seed of the gospel.
[time=3148] And over and over again as we track his life through the book of Matthew and the other gospels, we find him preaching repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[time=3156] He preached it high, he preached it low. He preached it in person and he preached it in public.
[time=3161] Every conceivable way Jesus lived the message that he was the Messiah and that people needed to repent and come to the saving knowledge that could be found in him.
[time=3173] So he went into the field and he sowed the seed of gospel and he went weeping, didn't he?
[time=3178] He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief because he knew that eventually it would be his own body buried like a grain of wheat in the furrow of the grave.
[time=3191] After that sowing over and over and over again was not enough and the nation of Israel would not turn of their own volition Jesus gave up his life and died.
[time=3203] But as the text reminds us he rose again and therefore he shall come.
[time=3208] He shall come. He's coming back. And our great and awesome privilege is to know the reality that he will come.
[time=3219] We are not waiting for a king who has forgotten us. We are not waiting for a king who has forsaken us.
[time=3226] We are not waiting for a king who is disinterested or distracted. He's coming back.
[time=3234] And until he does ours is the working and the weeping and the waiting.
[time=3239] And then on special and unique and marvelous days like today, the rejoicing.
[time=3246] Times that are so full and so rich and so marvelous.
[time=3252] So they come when the Lord verse 1 brought back the captive ones of Zion and we were like those who dream the excitement, the enthusiasm, all of it was too much for us to handle.
[time=3265] And we have said with the nations the Lord has done great things for us and we are glad.
[time=3273] But then upon returning to the land and seeing its condition and understanding all that it means for them to be back in the land they cry out if memory of the nagev and say oh it's parched.
[time=3283] It's dry. It's sun-baked. There is no productivity here.
[time=3290] Please oh God return to us the streams in the south and that is exactly what would happen when the rain would start to fall.
[time=3297] It would begin even as a trickle and then it would be a river and then it would be a torrent of water.
[time=3303] It was overwhelming. The abundance that would come.
[time=3309] And then we like that faithful, faithful farmer to be out in the field doing our work even to the point of weeping as we wait to see what God will do.
[time=3319] It's a blessed and a glorious day.
[time=3324] Let's pray together.
[time=3331] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father how we thank you for the chance to be together.
[time=3337] How we thank you for the opportunity to come into this place and worship and lift our hearts and our voices.
[time=3344] Thank you for the splendor that is here as the love of Jesus Christ emanates from the hearts and lives and faces and eyes of each person.
[time=3354] Father we pray that you would give us grace in the days ahead.
[time=3357] We look forward to what is awaiting us.
[time=3359] We look forward to the ministry that you would have for each and every one of us.
[time=3364] We do pause on a day like this and give thanks for all that has gone before us.
[time=3370] We think of David Jeremiah and for his labor of love and for the ministry that he has had in this place.
[time=3377] We thank you for his faithfulness to the Word of God and to loving you.
[time=3383] We thank you that his family is intact and his ministry is fruitful and abundant.
[time=3390] We thank you for Rick and for the years of faithful service, strategic ministry.
[time=3397] We thank you that you are involved in his life even today.
[time=3401] But you love him as much today as you did the day he was born and that there are yet wonderful and fruitful days ahead for he and his family.
[time=3411] And Father as we move into this new and bright and glorious day, it is our prayer that we would be a humble people.
[time=3421] That we would find ourselves on our knees.
[time=3426] That there would be no boasting or arrogance or pride or self-sufficiency just because so much is so right here, so much is going so well.
[time=3436] Help us instead to cry out for even greater mercy, to continue to serve you with a first love, to serve you with a joy, to serve you with anticipation.
[time=3449] Father, thank you for the unnamed saints, those that, names I don't know and many in the family don't know, but you are making those daily, regular, enormous contributions.
[time=3461] We know you know their names, we know you will reward them in a great and wonderful way.
[time=3468] Father, we even thank you for the gift, the monetary gift given to the school this week.
[time=3475] What a sign from heaven that seems to be, what a great confirmation that is upon the faculty and staff of our school and on all this church as it is indeed a ministry of this church.
[time=3488] Thank you that you have put it in someone's heart to give that way and that we can then use those funds to only strengthen the ministry that we want.

[time=3528] Father, I'm thankful that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3535] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3538] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
