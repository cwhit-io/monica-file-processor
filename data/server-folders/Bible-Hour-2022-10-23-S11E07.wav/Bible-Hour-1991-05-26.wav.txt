[time=0] (bells chiming)
[time=60] (bells chiming) - A pipa-the-o.
[time=83] You've probably never heard that word before in your life, but you experience the power of that word every day of your life.
[time=90] A pipa-the-o.
[time=91] It's the Greek word the Bible uses to describe the strong passions, the intense desires in your soul.
[time=98] Stay with us this morning as we'll look at how to set those passions for the pure milk of God's word.
[time=105] (dramatic music)
[time=118] - Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship.
[time=123] Thank you for joining us.
[time=125] Pastor Morris' message today is entitled "Desiring the Word." His text is taken from the book of 1 Peter, chapter one, verses one through three.
[time=134] You won't have to become a Greek scholar to understand today's message.
[time=138] Just be prepared to open your heart and mind so that you may learn to have a strong passion for the pure milk of the word.
[time=145] Before Russ' message, we will hear special music from Lynn Rolle singing "O Calvary's Lamb." And Dave and Debbie Johnson playing a medley of songs about the cross.
[time=156] Let's join today's service now as the sanctuary choir sings "Make His Praise Glorious." (upbeat music)
[time=177] [MUSIC - 209 seconds]
[time=388] (audience applauds) - Amen.
[time=395] We draw our attention now to the song on number 79, Jesus the very thought of you.
[time=400] We lift our praises with great power and conviction and then we draw our attention now to a song of meditation.
[time=408] We're gonna sing the first verse once with the instruments and then we're gonna repeat the first verse, acapella, and then sing the second, third, and fifth.
[time=417] Number 79, Jesus the very thought of thee.
[time=420] (gentle music)
[time=426] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=584] - So thankful that God not only gives us promises
[time=591] as we accept Him of mansions in heaven, but He gives us the peace and the tranquility that we can experience because we know Him as Savior on this earth.
[time=598] So we can experience it here and look forward as Paul did to that glorious time when He'd be with the Lord.
[time=604] So listen now to the music of Lynn Rolish.
[time=606] She sings for us to our attention to the ministry she has.
[time=610] (dramatic music)
[time=628] [MUSIC - 219 seconds]
[time=852] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=862] These are exciting days at the Black Hawk Baptist Church and in particular in the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=869] Just this last week I wrote to a number of you just telling you about our ministry and it's not often that we talk about money on the Bible Hour but there are times where we have to write letters that just let you know of our need and the ministry so that it can keep on going for the cause of Christ and I hope that you read that letter, had a number of responses already, just actually an unusual number of responses to this letter and we're grateful for that and we're thankful for the many, many Founders Club members that faithfully watched the Bible Hour and support it financially.
[time=902] We appreciate that.
[time=904] I hoped you watched the Bible Hour last week because that was the beginning of a new era for the Bible Hour and the introduction of our new pastor, teacher Russ Mornie's with me today.
[time=913] Good morning Russ.
[time=914] - Good morning Pete and I'm so thankful to be a part of the Bible Hour because I know it's your heart and it's my heart to bring faithful preaching of God's Word each and every Sunday and I know when we add that to the music that goes on it's a great thing to know that we can give people an opportunity to hear the Word of God and to worship even through television.
[time=934] - Right, Russ we had a number of people last week at the church and we had kind of a continental breakfast beforehand and one of our cameramen went around and just took some video of what happened before our service began that our viewers can't see but we wanted to show a little bit of that this morning.
[time=952] We might just watch it too and just kind of make comment on what was happening that morning.
[time=957] - Well I was amazed.
[time=959] I had no idea you all had these things in mind and so I remember driving up to the church early Sunday morning and seeing that beautiful sign that welcomed my family and me and then these tents and then everybody started coming and the food it was overwhelming.
[time=972] - Well we did have Jill Nor was one of our members who baked all of the goodies and the kids undoubtedly enjoyed them as well as the adults but the fellowship was good too.
[time=984] There was just an aura of excitement and anticipation for the day as the people welcomed you and Heidi and Randy, Nikki, Kelly and Whitney even the young ones got involved here.
[time=997] - You know the welcome wasn't even just that Sunday of course remember the reception at the airport when we first arrived and then people from Blackhawk were coming by our home throughout the week to help us move in and to fix things.
[time=1009] One guy even changed the starter on my truck, it went out and hardly knows me but it came over and we went to the park store together and saved me a whole bunch of money.
[time=1017] The warmth and the sense of community and the love that we're experiencing is overwhelming indeed.
[time=1023] - Well we had a great morning and our people responded well they were anxious to support your ministry that first Sunday and I know that that's the climate that will be here in future days and I even feel that russes it relates to the Bible hour with this response already of people writing in and I hope that continues.
[time=1044] If you don't go to a church regularly we want you to continue doing that but we also have special events that take place from time to time and we'd like to have you involved.
[time=1054] One of which is our patriotic panorama, this is the 18th annual patriotic panorama here at Blackhawk Baptist Church and it will be held on Sunday, June 30th at 4 p.m.
[time=1064] We're calling it Main Street America and Russ this is an ideal year for us to again honor those men and women who fought in the various wars and have stood up for our country.
[time=1075] My uncle was a marine, in fact he was a fighter pilot, he was a World War II ace.
[time=1081] Arthur Newcomb Neff was his name and I wish that he were still alive today 'cause I'd buy a ticket and fly him out here so that he could be a part of this great celebration.
[time=1090] - Well there are no tickets necessary Russ and I hope that people will however put that date down on their calendar.
[time=1097] Again it's Sunday, June 30th at 4 p.m.
[time=1100] right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1105] Come and join with us, our pastor will be speaking briefly, we'll have lots of patriotic music that'll honor our country and honor God.
[time=1112] I hope you'll be there.
[time=1114] And Russ these are days when we're already talking about relationships among our staff between the staff and the congregation and we're offering a booklet.
[time=1123] This month this will be the last time we'll have the opportunity.
[time=1125] It's entitled Relationships by Pamela Reeves and we all know how important it is for us to work together in the Kingdom.
[time=1133] - You know we live in a day in an era where our schedules get so busy, they almost work against the kind of relationships we see describing God's Word.
[time=1142] And this little booklet that's being offered I think has some helpful hints on how to build and cultivate strong biblical relationships.
[time=1150] - I hope that you'll take a moment and just write to the Bible Hour today for this booklet.
[time=1155] Just write for it and ask for the booklet relationships and write to the Bible Hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1167] You can receive this booklet absolutely free by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1178] We're very pleased that you've chosen to join us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=1182] We hope that you'll stay tuned for a little bit more music and the message from our new pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=1187] Stay tuned for the Bible Hour today.
[time=1189] (gentle music)
[time=1373] (applause)
[time=1385] Thank you very much, Dave and Debbie.
[time=1387] Beautiful ministry.
[time=1389] Well, finish my first full official week here as pastor of Black Hawk Baptist Church, and it was a great week.
[time=1396] Thank you for your prayers and your support.
[time=1399] Had a super time with the exception of one nervous moment I received in my box in the office newspaper clipping which captures an Ann Landers article.
[time=1410] Says this, "Dear Ann, the enclosed was circulated "in the church this morning.
[time=1415] "It's an eye-opener for people who change churches "or quit going because they think the pastor "isn't doing enough.
[time=1423] "Please print it.
[time=1424] "It's more than just funny.
[time=1426] "Sign Indiana." (audience laughs) She responds, "Dear Indiana, it's a gym.
[time=1433] "Thanks for sharing." Now, this is entitled "How to obtain a perfect pastor."
[time=1440] It reads this way.
[time=1442] Results of a computerized survey indicate that the perfect pastor preaches exactly 15 minutes.
[time=1448] He condemns sin but never embarrasses anyone.
[time=1452] He works from 8 a.m. until midnight and is also the janitor.
[time=1457] (audience laughs) He makes $60 a week, wears good clothes, drives a new car, and gives $50 a week to the poor.
[time=1466] He's 28 years old and he's been preaching for 25 years.
[time=1470] He's a wonderfully gentle person.
[time=1473] He loves to work with teenagers and spends countless hours with senior citizens.
[time=1478] He makes 15 calls daily on parish families, shut-ins, and hospital patients, and he's always in his office when he's needed.
[time=1486] This is where I really got nervous.
[time=1488] If your pastor does not measure up, simply send this letter to six other churches that are tired of their pastors too.
[time=1497] Then bundle up your pastor and send him to the church at the top of the list.
[time=1502] In one week, you'll receive 1,643 pastors.
[time=1506] One of them is bound to be perfect.
[time=1508] (audience laughs) Well, I'm not perfect.
[time=1514] Many of you already know that, and I'll make no effort to be perfect, but I do promise and covenant with you to try as best as I can to work as hard as I can to come ready to preach the Word of God each Sunday morning and Sunday evening.
[time=1529] And I trust that you will bring with you your spiritual appetite, a true longing and a craving for the pure milk of the Word.
[time=1539] And I thought it might be helpful for us to think a little bit about that this morning, so if you have your Bibles, why don't you open them to 1 Peter chapter 2.
[time=1548] 1 Peter chapter 2, there's an exciting portion of Scripture here that instructs us about longing for the pure milk of the Word.
[time=1558] Why don't you follow along as I read it.
[time=1561] 1 Peter chapter 2, "Therefore, putting aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the Word that by it you may grow in respect to salvation if you've tasted the kindness of the Lord." The word long there is epipathyto in the Greek.
[time=1585] You may have an NIV with you this morning and it may be translated "crave." And this probably gives me an opportunity to tell you that after much thought and prayer and consultation with fear and trepidation, I do say that I believe I shall stay with the new American standard.
[time=1601] And I want you to know that's not because I don't support the NIV or think it an unworthy translation.
[time=1606] It's just there's a comfort factor and a familiarity with me and with this translation and this Bible that compels me to stay with it.
[time=1614] And it certainly doesn't mean you need to change Bibles.
[time=1616] I mean, if you're comfortable with your version, you might even enjoy the comparison.
[time=1620] Each Sunday morning I'll be in one text and you'll be in another and as long as you don't get lost, you'll get to check me on some points.
[time=1627] But at any rate, epipathyto is the Word in the Greek and it's a word that cuts through the superficial stuff in our lives and touches way down deep inside of our souls.
[time=1638] It's a powerful word because it describes a very powerful thing within us to long for something.
[time=1645] Talking about our passions, talking about our intense desires.
[time=1650] Peter in writing this letter put this word epipathyto in compound with a preposition which intensifies the force of it.
[time=1657] He's got it as strong as he can make it.
[time=1660] He wants to talk to you and to me this morning about our strongest longings, our strongest passions, if you will.
[time=1669] Now I think it's amazing how God has chosen to create we human beings with this remarkable capacity to long for things, to want things, to hope for things, to desire things.
[time=1683] That's not in and of itself bad.
[time=1685] In fact, I think we should be forever grateful that he's given this.
[time=1688] It brings color to our lives.
[time=1691] It helps us understand and explains the compelling movement of a man towards his wife and vice versa.
[time=1698] It helps us understand why a mother and a father would gladly and willingly die for a child because of the passion in their heart for the welfare of that little one.
[time=1709] It's the stuff that beats and the breasts of our young men as they march off the battle and perform heroic acts, their love for their country and their homeland and the desire to protect it.
[time=1721] It's the strong passions of life.
[time=1724] When we hear in the life of Paul, we find that over in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 2, he says this, "For indeed, in this house, meaning his flesh, we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from having, longing is our word." And what he describes here is this deep, intense passion in his life to get out of his body, to get out of his flesh, go off this earth and get up there to heaven.
[time=1749] The new heaven and the new earth, the holy city, the new Jerusalem where God himself shall be among them.
[time=1757] Paul here is longing and craving with an insatiable desire to be up in heaven where God is.
[time=1765] So God has given us ability to feel deeply and to be impassioned for things and it's wonderful, it's a blessing.
[time=1774] But as you and I know, both from Scripture and from our own experience, that misdirected passion is lust.
[time=1784] It's lust.
[time=1785] The Bible uses usually a different word for that, not a epi-the-- oh, but epi-themia.
[time=1792] It's the word we find in 1 John for the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes.
[time=1797] And once this passion within us is misdirected and placed onto the things of the world or even inordinately held for good things, the Bible condemns it and calls it lust.
[time=1809] And one of its most dangerous properties is that it can quench our desire
[time=1815] for the things of God, for the word of God.
[time=1818] Would you turn with me to Mark chapter 4?
[time=1821] Jesus is teaching here a parable about the sower and the seed, and he explains to us that this inordinate passion, misdirected, will extinguish our desire for the word of God.
[time=1835] Mark 4, verse 18, "And others are the ones on whom seed, the word of God,
[time=1841] was sown among the thorns.
[time=1843] These are the ones who have heard the word and the worries of the world and the deceitfulness of riches, and here's our word, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful." Here are these desires.
[time=1858] Misdirected are compared to a thorn bush that's growing too fast.
[time=1863] It grows too far and too wide, and this little seed that's been planted, there has no room to grow, and it gets choked out and dies.
[time=1872] And he, of course, is comparing this to our heart and our mind when it becomes overrun by our desires and our passions.
[time=1879] God, given as they may be, but when they get misdirected, it's as if our hearts and minds are overrun by them, and there's no room in our heart or in our mind anymore for meditation on the word of God, and the longing for the word of God is extinguished, and as it says here in these people's cases, it's unfruitful, meaning no life.
[time=1899] These folks are unsaved, and this is the gospel that's being sown in their life, and because of these inordinate passions for the things of the world, the word of God which is sown there is extinguished, and instead of life and liberty and Jesus Christ, they find death and damnation.
[time=1919] Following their strongest passions in a pursuit of what looks like freedom and what feels like freedom, they realize a damning bondage that brings them to be slaves of their own passions.
[time=1934] It's a horrible place to be.
[time=1936] The inner man is there held captive under the tyranny of sin.
[time=1940] It's almost as if you're on a desert and you're dying of thirst, and you see off in the distance a beautiful lake, and you begin to move with great purpose in that direction, using maybe the last little bit of strength you've got to get there, and when you arrive you find it was nothing but a mirage.
[time=1957] When these passions in our souls are misdirected for the things of the world,
[time=1963] we set a course for what looks like freedom, what looks like life, and find in its place death.
[time=1971] And so it goes with the unsaved man.
[time=1976] But the horrible reality is that it can happen to you and to me even as believers.
[time=1983] We still are humans, we still have this huge capacity to feel and to want and to long for things.
[time=1989] That's a blessing, but we too can have it misdirected.
[time=1994] And when that happens, our longing for the Word of God is extinguished.
[time=1999] Romans 6, 12 says, "Do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey its lust." He's speaking to Christians.
[time=2008] He's speaking in that passage to people who have, like we have, as Christians died in Christ and been risen again to walk in newness of life.
[time=2017] And he's imploring us, "Don't allow the sin to reign in your mortal body such that you should obey its lust and be held captive to it."
[time=2029] I went a list we could bring this morning.
[time=2031] If all of us were to take out a piece of paper and write down those deceptive and subtle things that capture our affections and distort our love for God and for His Word.
[time=2045] I grew up watching a lot of TV.
[time=2047] I don't know why, I just did.
[time=2049] I love TV.
[time=2051] And now even as a grown man, I can find myself nothing wrong with TV.
[time=2056] What gets wrong with it is when it somehow it sneaks in there and all I want to do is watch it and I'll come home and instead of being a good father and a productive guy helping my wife and working with the kids, I can feel this.
[time=2068] Paul, I hate it.
[time=2071] Fix my desires on you, God.
[time=2077] It's a battle, isn't it?
[time=2079] It's a struggle.
[time=2081] Sometimes I'll even look at my Bible, this one.
[time=2085] And I feel a deep sense of guilt and shame and conviction as I see it there because I can remember the first time I ever saw this book.
[time=2094] It was a gift to me from my parents on my 21st birthday shortly after my conversion and I can see myself unwrapping it as if it were yesterday and I pulled it out and it was everything I ever wanted.
[time=2104] It was leather and it smelled so nice.
[time=2106] You know, that new smell and the pages were crisp and they glistened in the light and all I wanted to do was study this book and hug it and hold it even and kind of sleep with it.
[time=2116] You know, this is my Bible.
[time=2118] I couldn't get enough of it.
[time=2120] And when I try to study it downstairs, people would interrupt me so I put a card table up in my bedroom.
[time=2125] I didn't have a desk so I just took it out of the closet and I lifted it up there and got it all set and had my books from my study and as strong as at points in my life I've been pulled to ridiculously unproductive things.
[time=2138] I felt myself pulled toward the Word of God.
[time=2141] I couldn't get enough of it to study it and to memorize it and to know it.
[time=2146] Sometimes I wonder where does that go?
[time=2149] Why then sometimes when I look at it, does it just lay there?
[time=2153] Kind of limp and thick and heavy and there's no compulsion to open it.
[time=2158] In fact, it's just kind of there and I find myself drawn off into all the other interests of life.
[time=2164] Where does the magic go?
[time=2166] Sometimes I'm tempted to buy a new one.
[time=2169] You know, just in hopes that new leather smell will do something in me.
[time=2176] You know, I won't.
[time=2178] The problem is it with my Bible.
[time=2180] The problem is with me.
[time=2182] And where I have set my affections and ways in which I have allowed this gift of God, the ability to want and to feel deeply and to long for things, but when it gets misdirected
[time=2198] restoring that passion for the Word of God is not an easy thing.
[time=2203] Keeping that fire hot.
[time=2205] Keeping the burner turned on.
[time=2207] That's not easy.
[time=2208] It takes work.
[time=2210] And I don't think there are four or five simple steps that if I could just share with you today and you write them down, take them home and put them up somewhere where you'll see it again that all of a sudden we'll all together enjoy that passion for the Word that I know we all want.
[time=2225] But I believe that in our passage, in 1 Peter, if you'll go back there with me now, I believe that in this passage surrounding this command really to long for the Word of God.
[time=2236] There are some principles that might help us.
[time=2238] And I'd be happy to share them.
[time=2240] The first is a little unusual.
[time=2243] It may not make sense to you immediately.
[time=2245] I hope I can get it to make sense to you by the end of the hour.
[time=2248] The first principle that is communicated in this text as to longing for the Word of God is to be setting relational goals in your life.
[time=2257] Set relational goals in your life.
[time=2261] Now why do I say that?
[time=2263] Would you look right behind the phrase long for the pure milk of the Word?
[time=2267] It says that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.
[time=2273] And we must begin by defining what does it mean really to grow in our salvation?
[time=2278] What is spiritual maturity?
[time=2280] What does it look like?
[time=2281] How can I recognize it when I see it in other people and even in myself?
[time=2286] Questions come.
[time=2287] Is it how long I've been saved?
[time=2289] Does that make me spiritually mature?
[time=2291] Is it how faithful and how regular and how lengthy my quiet times are?
[time=2296] Is it my faithfulness and service that I've sung in the choir and I've helped in Awana and I've been with the youth group and I served in the nursery and I've got quite a list here of effective ministries at Black Hawk.
[time=2309] Or is it some position, some position of leadership?
[time=2313] You're a Bible study leader.
[time=2314] Are you mature?
[time=2317] You're a deacon, an elder.
[time=2320] What is Christian maturity?
[time=2324] What is it that this verse is saying will produce if we long for the pure milk of the Word?
[time=2330] Well, we could import some thoughts from other portions of Scripture.
[time=2333] We could talk about Christ's likeness from Romans 8 and I believe that that's a valid description of Christian growth and maturity.
[time=2340] We could talk about holy behavior.
[time=2342] That's certainly an element.
[time=2344] We could talk about the knowledge of God, but I believe right here in this very passage the idea of growing in respect to salvation is clearly taught.
[time=2352] Let's go back to verse 1.
[time=2354] Therefore, putting aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envy and
[time=2360] all slander.
[time=2362] Do you realize these are all relational terms?
[time=2365] All five of those terms deal with how we interact with other people in our relationships.
[time=2371] It's foundational that we understand what this passage is talking about, not just so we can rightly interpret it, but so we can interpret our own Christianity properly.
[time=2380] What this verse is saying is that growth in respect to salvation is relational maturity.
[time=2387] The word malice.
[time=2389] See it there?
[time=2390] It can just mean all sorts of wickedness, but very, very often frequently it's used in the New Testament to make this pointed reference to active ill will amongst people involved in relationship.
[time=2402] Active ill will holding a grudge, waiting for my opportunity to get back at you.
[time=2407] And you hurt me back there and I'm not going to forget it.
[time=2409] And if I get a chance to help you, you can bet I won't.
[time=2412] Guile is the next word.
[time=2415] It talks about deceit.
[time=2416] It's the original word used for a fish hook.
[time=2419] And that's certainly a deceitful thing.
[time=2421] The fish thinks he's getting a meal and ends up a meal.
[time=2424] The guile and deceit that goes on inside of relationships.
[time=2428] Hypocrisy, meaning pretense.
[time=2431] People who are more concerned about how they appear their image as opposed to who they really are and how they really treat other people.
[time=2438] It's not that I care about you.
[time=2440] I just want you to like me because I like it when you like me.
[time=2443] And perception is compromised.
[time=2446] Excuse me, character is compromised for perception.
[time=2450] The next word is envy.
[time=2452] And that's obviously a relational term.
[time=2454] It talks about that anger or that grudge that you hold inside your heart because somebody has something that you want and you can't have it.
[time=2461] Whether it's something in ministry or some material possession or even a person.
[time=2465] And then slander.
[time=2470] You can't slander a tree.
[time=2473] You can't slander a dog so much.
[time=2476] Slander is something that goes on between human beings.
[time=2479] And the word literally means to run somebody down.
[time=2481] It's to use your mind and your mouth to run somebody down.
[time=2484] Tear their reputation down to your own advantage.
[time=2487] And so all five of these terms are defining for us what it means to grow.
[time=2493] Put this stuff off.
[time=2495] The word to put off means to take off a garment.
[time=2498] And it has the picture of taking off a filthy garment.
[time=2502] And what God is saying to us this morning is as you evaluate your Christian life.
[time=2508] As you look at the relationships in your life, see them and your failures in them as filthy garments and be happy to get rid of them.
[time=2517] I remember traveling in Russia last summer and I lost my luggage.
[time=2520] I was on a nine day trip up into the Carpathian mountains and what they called a retreat.
[time=2525] I called a hillside.
[time=2526] There were no facilities.
[time=2527] There were no showers.
[time=2528] There was nothing.
[time=2529] And I had no luggage.
[time=2530] It got lost.
[time=2531] I never saw it again until I got back to LA.
[time=2534] You know what that means?
[time=2535] That means I got up at about four in the morning left at five with my shoes and my socks and my pants and all the shirt and jacket.
[time=2541] That's all I wore for nine straight days camping up in the mountains.
[time=2546] The first couple of days it was hard for me to interact with the Russian folk.
[time=2549] They had a different odor than I did.
[time=2551] They kind of had body odor.
[time=2553] By the third day everybody smelled great.
[time=2555] I was one of them.
[time=2558] And there was no reason to take off my clothes.
[time=2561] I had nothing new to put on and I certainly couldn't wash them all.
[time=2564] What would I do in the interim while they're drying?
[time=2566] So I just wore my clothes.
[time=2568] I wore them to bed.
[time=2569] I wore them when I got up.
[time=2570] I just never took them off.
[time=2571] I didn't take one piece of clothing off once for nine days.
[time=2575] Are you getting my picture?
[time=2578] Finally, I'm on this plane and I'm going to come along from Chicago to LAX.
[time=2582] It's the last leg and man, I think.
[time=2585] And I'm looking at my ticket and I'm realizing, man, where am I going to sit?
[time=2589] You know how you anticipate?
[time=2591] There's poor little college girl.
[time=2593] It's going to have to sit next to me.
[time=2595] So when I'm three rows away from her, I pause and I say, "Excuse me." I stink.
[time=2601] She looks at you.
[time=2602] She's wet.
[time=2603] I said, "I've been in the mountains in Russia for nine days.
[time=2605] I haven't had a shower.
[time=2606] Same clothes the whole time.
[time=2607] I'm really sorry.
[time=2608] I've got to sit next to you." She's like, "Oh, that's all right." You know, she's thinking, "No problem.
[time=2612] Have a seat." She doesn't know what I say when I say steak.
[time=2616] I sit down and it's just seconds before she's inching her body over away from me, trying to get away from this.
[time=2622] And she's, you know, her little vent up there.
[time=2625] By the time we take off and the light comes down, I can tell this woman is in trauma.
[time=2629] She's going to go into a coma at any moment.
[time=2631] So I move to another part in the plane where nobody is around me.
[time=2633] I stink.
[time=2635] Bad.
[time=2636] My wife gave me one hug and said, "That's it, pal.
[time=2639] Shower.
[time=2640] I showered.
[time=2641] I still stunk.
[time=2643] I showered again.
[time=2645] It took three days to get the junk off of me that had filled up in my pores.
[time=2651] Hey, listen.
[time=2652] You know what happens when you and I are involved with people and we've got slander and we've got hypocrisy and we've got guile and we've got malice?
[time=2661] We stink.
[time=2663] We just stink.
[time=2666] And what he's doing, he's offering us the opportunity to take it off, get it out of your life.
[time=2671] Grow as a Christian.
[time=2673] That's why you got saved.
[time=2676] Well, so you could love one another.
[time=2681] Let me show that to you.
[time=2682] Look at chapter 1.
[time=2683] This is really one paragraph.
[time=2684] Chapter 1, 22, all the way down to 2, 3.
[time=2688] Chapter 1, verse 22, "Since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere
[time=2694] love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, amen."
[time=2700] Now let me break that down.
[time=2703] Since you have an obedience to the truth, that's when you've got saved.
[time=2706] When somebody obeys the truth at the beginning and they've purified their souls, this is the beginning of it all.
[time=2711] This is the salvation experience of coming to the person of Jesus Christ, who we call the truth.
[time=2717] And when he comes into our lives, he purifies our souls.
[time=2721] Why for a sincere love of the brethren?
[time=2726] That's why you got saved.
[time=2727] Yes, you got saved of the glory of God, but you also got saved so that you could love the brethren.
[time=2733] And then this command, "So fervently love one another from the heart." Mine lands.
[time=2738] You realize that's why we're here.
[time=2740] We're here so that we can love each other passionately and fully and completely from our hearts.
[time=2747] You know this word agape for love, it's great.
[time=2749] It's true.
[time=2750] They say it's a verb and it really is.
[time=2752] And what gets taught sometimes is that because it's a verb, a verb is an action, and so when God says to love, he doesn't say you have to feel and get little fuzzies and warmies about people.
[time=2761] You just go love them because it's an action, so do it.
[time=2764] That's true.
[time=2767] For God so loved the world that he what?
[time=2769] He gave the action.
[time=2771] It's a self-sacrificial action on behalf of another person.
[time=2774] That's the essence of love.
[time=2775] But this verse shows us that it's more than just an action.
[time=2779] He's calling us from the depths of our souls with all of this passion that he has given us to direct it at these people and fervently love them from the heart.
[time=2791] So what I am suggesting to you this morning may sound a little strange, but it's nevertheless I believe it's true.
[time=2797] I believe the greatest evaluation of spiritual maturity.
[time=2800] If you want to know if you're spiritually mature, you examine the relationships in your life.
[time=2806] That will tell you not how many hours you spend in quiet time, not how long you've been a member of this church, not how many different service projects you've been a part of, praise God for all that stuff.
[time=2819] Doesn't necessarily mean you're a mature, godly person, mature, godly people are people
[time=2825] who are in the process of taking off the garments of their relational failures and learning
[time=2832] to fervently love one another from the heart.
[time=2837] I want to support that just a little bit this morning.
[time=2839] Would you turn with me to 1 Timothy?
[time=2842] Timothy's a beautiful book written by Paul to his number one disciple, Timothy Child in the Faith.
[time=2848] He's been left there.
[time=2850] Timothy has at Ephesus to set the church in order and already, even after the remarkable
[time=2857] ministry of Paul, there are some men who are teaching false doctrine and it's producing the wrong stuff, the wrong behavior, the wrong emphasis, the wrong direction for this church.
[time=2868] And so Paul leaves Timothy.
[time=2869] Would you look at verse three?
[time=2872] As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and
[time=2884] endless genealogies which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration
[time=2890] of God which is by faith.
[time=2892] And then he says what we're all about, look at it, verse five, but the goal of our instruction in contrast to these false teachers is what?
[time=2902] Love.
[time=2903] The goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere
[time=2909] faith.
[time=2910] You know what the goal of this entire book is, beyond ultimately the glory of God and
[time=2916] the revelation of God and the person of Jesus Christ, it's so that you and I can learn to love each other powerfully and effectively from a pure heart and a good conscience and
[time=2929] a sincere faith.
[time=2931] Well, no wonder if you'll turn out at chapter three of the same book, what do you think of when you think of the most mature people around?
[time=2941] You ought to think of your elders.
[time=2944] It's the highest office on earth, it's higher than the presidency of the United States of America because the church is above any nation, the church is the bride of Christ, the church
[time=2955] is the apple of God's eye, and God has set out in this book, who should lead that church?
[time=2965] They're called elders, look at it, verse three, it's a trustworthy statement.
[time=2969] If any man aspires to the office of overseer, overseer is just another word for elder.
[time=2975] That's a fine work that he desires to do, in other words, if you're aspiring to give
[time=2981] leadership to the church of God, that's great, but the question remains are you qualified?
[time=2989] The question remains are you qualified, and that's what the next verses are all about.
[time=2994] How do I know if I'm qualified to be an elder to lead the church?
[time=2999] I highlight this only to establish the truth once again that spiritual maturity is evidenced in relational maturity.
[time=3007] Look at the criteria, verse two, and overseer then must be above reproach.
[time=3012] That first phrase, above reproach, functions as an umbrella over all the other lists of criteria that will soon follow.
[time=3019] Be above reproach means that no one can come into your life and lay a hold of some shortcoming in your life.
[time=3026] It means that a charge can't be brought against you, a legitimate charge can't be brought against you, and so Paul, having said that, you must be above reproach, lists the categories
[time=3036] in which charges could and should be brought.
[time=3040] Again verse two, and overseer then must be above reproach.
[time=3044] First criteria, the husband of one wife or a one woman man, this is talking about a husband
[time=3053] who is completely and totally devoted to his wife.
[time=3058] This is talking about the most important relationship known to man anywhere on earth, the relationship
[time=3064] that exists between a husband and his wife.
[time=3067] Criteria number one, if you'd like to know if you're spiritually mature, examine the quality of your relationship with your wife.
[time=3076] That's tough isn't it, because how many times are we at home and we're in this thing called
[time=3082] a wrestling match, a verbal wrestling match with our wives, and there's anger, and there's strife going on, and suddenly we hit the door and everything's peachy keen.
[time=3092] Man see, they know that possible Paul, he knows too much, disqualified, if that's a
[time=3099] regular pattern, not that we don't struggle with our wives and wives with our husbands.
[time=3104] But he invades back down deep into the number one criteria, the first and most important relationship on the planet, outside of our relationship with God, your wife.
[time=3112] Secondly, look at verse four, he says he must be one who manages his own household well,
[time=3119] keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=3122] Now to manage your household, we're not talking about your budget, we're not talking about keeping the lawn cut, we're not talking about keeping the garage clean, ultimately within the household we're talking about how that man treats his children.
[time=3137] Are those relationships of the character and the quality that those children are therefore
[time=3143] under control with all dignity?
[time=3149] Sphere number three would be the church, the people in the church, look at verse five, but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?
[time=3159] In other words, the reason that's criteria number two is because criteria number three is how will he manage the household of God.
[time=3165] And when we think about elders and managing the household of God, sometimes we think about budgets and we think about building programs and we think about all the kinds of things that big churches sometimes have to deal with, but that's not what he's talking about.
[time=3178] These folks didn't have a church building, meeting in somebody's house.
[time=3182] How does it mean to manage the household of God?
[time=3185] It means that these spiritual men must be strong in their ability to be in relationship with the sheep and interact in a positive and gracious manner and to manage that huge
[time=3196] living organism of relationships.
[time=3201] And then category number four, look at verse seven.
[time=3205] He must have a good reputation with those outside the church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=3214] This says that one of the voices, one of the voices in establishing whether or not a man
[time=3220] is qualified to lead a church, to be on an elder board, to be a deacon because very much
[time=3226] the same qualifications are there for deacons.
[time=3229] But beyond that, to be a mature person, one of the voices crying out that must resound
[time=3235] with a solid note is the unregenerate people in our lives.
[time=3241] The unregenerate folk in our lives have something to say about whether or not we are truly mature in Christ.
[time=3250] The way we treat our friends at work, the way we treat our neighbors on the street, the way we treat the people in the stores, can they lay a hold of something in your life?
[time=3261] Not above reproach.
[time=3269] So we find here, as an illustration of spiritual maturity, these men as overseers and find this
[time=3276] list full of all of the vital relationships of life.
[time=3282] You say, what does that have to do with longing for the Word of God again?
[time=3288] We'll go back to first Peter again, please.
[time=3298] If you approach the Word of God so that you can say, "I have my quiet time," or because
[time=3306] you have some pressure because you're in the choir or because you're in leadership and you're fulfilling some obligation, if you approach the Word of God so that you can get knowledge or memorize more verses, you will short-circuit that for which you should long
[time=3322] from the Word of God.
[time=3324] Long for the pure milk of the Word that by it you may grow, grow in your ability to love
[time=3330] and cultivate strong, godly relationships with the people in your life.
[time=3334] And when you walk through the days of your life and you feel the tension here and the stress there and the anxiety there and the pressure in that relationship and you see it, these categories of your life, allow that, don't excuse that as I'm not a very social person or, boy, I'm having a tough day or, man, that person's out of sorts, you must look and investigate the reality of your own Christian walk and say, where am I?
[time=3359] And out of that can come along for more of this milk, for more spiritual nourishment so
[time=3366] that the next time you'll be more gracious, you'll be more long-suffering, you'll be more patient, you'll be more sacrificial.
[time=3376] It's like a flow that gets going in your life.
[time=3380] As you begin to study the Word of God so that it should equip you to be able to live sacrificially and do what Jesus said when he said, if you follow me you'll take up your cross and deny yourself, deny yourself in what category.
[time=3391] He didn't mean not eat certain foods.
[time=3393] He didn't mean not do certain things other than obvious sin.
[time=3397] He's talking about denying the longings in your heart that are for your own self-gratification.
[time=3403] Turn the longings of your heart around and set them on God and set them on God's people and as you do, you'll open up a channel that the love of God will begin to flow through and you'll long for the pure milk of the Word to be sustained therein, can be a draining
[time=3419] and tiring process, but it will rekindle your longing for the Word of God.
[time=3427] One last portion before we close, Romans, Romans chapter 1, I want you to see Paul.
[time=3434] Paul lives what he preaches, he says over there, Romans chapter 1 verse 11, "For I long to see you in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you that you may be established."
[time=3445] He's longing again, he's epipethetoing again, he's craving in his soul to get to Rome because
[time=3451] in Rome there are people who need his spiritual gifts to mature and equip them for the cause of Christ.
[time=3457] The passion of his heart and it opens up a channel of water, if we will, and the Word rushes through it and he's empty all of a sudden, so he's got to go back and get more.
[time=3466] Give me on the word of God, give me the spiritual nourishment that I need.
[time=3487] We've come to make his praise glorious today through music from our sanctuary choir, soloist Lynn Roll and a duet by Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=3496] The message today was from our new pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3500] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3510] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3517] Lord I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3520] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3524] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3528] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3533] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
