[time=0] (bells ringing)
[time=60] Jesus said, "Men shall not live by bread alone, by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God."
[time=75] Jeremiah said, "Thy words were found, and I did eat them." Job said that he learned to treasure the Word of God more than his necessary food.
[time=85] Spiritual nourishment from the Word of God.
[time=88] Stay with us this morning as we talk about longing for the pure milk of God's Word.
[time=95] (music playing)
[time=106] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship.
[time=112] Thank you for joining us.
[time=114] Pastor Moore is continuing his series entitled, "Desiring the Word." His text is taken from the book of 1 Peter chapter 1 verses 1 through 3.
[time=125] Jesus said, "We should not live by bread alone." Jeremiah and Job said, "We should know God's Word." Do you desire the spiritual nourishment of God's Word?
[time=135] Listen today and learn how you can have that longing for the pure milk of the Word.
[time=140] As a part of today's service, we will hear special music from the Black Hawk Christian School Girls Ensemble.
[time=146] They will be singing forever in his care and undivided.
[time=152] Let's join our service with a song from the Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra entitled, "Name Above All Names."
[time=160] (music playing)
[time=170] [MUSIC - 267 seconds]
[time=442] (audience applauding)
[time=452] - There is a name I love to hear.
[time=455] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[time=457] 529, please, we'll sing all four verses together.
[time=461] 529.
[time=463] (soft music) [MUSIC - 127 seconds]
[time=600] - Thank you very much for your wonderful singing.
[time=603] We appreciate it when you sing the praises of the Lord that enthusiastically.
[time=607] We continue with music now.
[time=610] This evening will be the commencement exercises of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=614] Ladies on some of it will be singing for you right now.
[time=617] Five of the six of them will be graduating.
[time=620] They've been involved in a number of musicals and concerts at our school and at our church.
[time=626] Just fine young ladies who've been singing for a number of years.
[time=629] Let's listen to them now as they sing a song of unity.
[time=632] We are undivided.
[time=650] [MUSIC - 221 seconds]
[time=876] (audience applauding)
[time=889] - Hello, and thank you for tuning into the Bible Hour today.
[time=892] We're glad that you've joined with us.
[time=894] This is the season of graduations, and graduation is no exception right here within our own church.
[time=900] Russell's nice to have you on the set again, and we are just thinking and have gone to many receptions for our own graduates of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=909] We have some 30 young people that are graduating from our school this year.
[time=913] - It's an amazing time of excitement as they see God bringing to fruition the things that He's been doing in their lives for the last 12 years.
[time=920] And we're so thankful that the Lord has been doing some unique and special things with our school.
[time=925] You're aware, and I want the people that are watching today to know that the Lord has given a gift of some $150,000 to our little school, a person who doesn't come to our church.
[time=937] They don't have children in our school they've just watched and observed from a distance, and apparently the Lord had given them some extra money, and so we received a letter the other week with a check in it for $150,000 saying we're committed to your school, use it however you choose, so we're so thankful for that.
[time=954] - That is very exciting.
[time=955] We were all rejoicing about that, and if there are any of you out there that are interested in a Christian school, you can contact the school by calling the telephone number 493-7400.
[time=966] There are still some openings because we've begun to double-track our elementary program.
[time=971] If you have any questions about the Christian school, we'd love to have you call us at 493-7400.
[time=978] Russ, we're in the summer season and Blackhawk, we really don't slow down, we try to keep things going, and we have what we call the summer celebration on Wednesday evenings, and I just think it's a great time if people don't go to church on Wednesday night in the middle of the week, this is a great time, we start off with some good seminars on Wednesday evening at seven o'clock.
[time=997] - The seminars have the kind of topics you don't want to miss.
[time=1000] There's one on your marriage, there's one on your kids, there's one on discipleship, there's one on your health and physical fitness, it's a tremendous opportunity to come and pick from various electives as to what you find your need to be at that time in your life.
[time=1013] - Russ, we have a brochure on all of the activities going on on Wednesday nights, and again, if you'd like to be involved in our Wednesday night program, just right to, that is called the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 493-7400, and we'll send you a brochure describing all of the activities for the summer on Wednesday evenings.
[time=1035] We have children's programs, everybody in the family would be involved.
[time=1039] And then we want to tell you about June 30th.
[time=1042] Russ, this is always an exciting time too, as we have the Patriotic Panorama, this is our 18th Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1048] We celebrate our country and what it means to us, and remember all of the men and women that have served in our armed forces, and thank God for this privilege to thank them and to live in this wonderful country.
[time=1061] So, it's going to be an exciting time.
[time=1063] I'm glad you're here.
[time=1064] You're going to speak to some of the people that watch you on the Bible Hour.
[time=1067] That might be a good time for them to come.
[time=1069] - You know, I remember as a little boy, my dad would wake us up in the morning with John Philip Sousa and the Star Spangled Banner, and we'd all go into the living room and he'd get out the fire proder there from the fireplace, and that was his deal, and he'd lead us all around in a parade, and we're a very Patriotic family, and we believe that God has raised this nation up for a great and awesome thing, and to come and be able to, as a church family, really worship God and honor the men and women that have served the country.
[time=1095] It's going to be a great day.
[time=1096] - Yeah, it's a fun time, and we invite you again to set that date aside.
[time=1100] That Sunday afternoon, June 30th at 4 p.m.
[time=1103] right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 7400 East State in Fort Wayne.
[time=1108] Come and join us for the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=1110] We're calling it Main Street America.
[time=1112] That's at 4 o'clock on June 30th.
[time=1115] And then finally, before we go back to our regular program, I want to tell you about our new gift offer, and it's called God's Promises for Your Every Need.
[time=1125] You know, Russ, again, we think that all of the problems that have happened in this world have just come in maybe the last 10 or 15 years, but since the days of Adam and Eve, we've had problems, and God has given many of the answers in his word, and this book separates those answers, takes scripture, and just categorizes them.
[time=1145] If you're discouraged, there's a section in there that you can read several scriptures from various passages in the Bible that'll help you with discouragement.
[time=1153] So I want you to write for this book today.
[time=1155] Just write and ask for the booklet entitled God's Promises.
[time=1159] And you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1168] Once again, that's the Bible Hour.
[time=1171] 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1178] Russ, we're going back to the regular program now, and we're going to have the Girls Ensemble sing again from Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=1185] Let's stay tuned, please, and join with the music and then our message from Pastor Russell.
[time=1198] [MUSIC] There was a time when I were friends [MUSIC] About the time that lies ahead [MUSIC] Until the time I save your said [MUSIC] You are mine [MUSIC] Never forget [MUSIC] So why should I worry [MUSIC] If it shines or rains [MUSIC] I'm safe and warm [MUSIC] Under his wings [MUSIC] I may know hurry [MUSIC] For an earthly thing [MUSIC] I'm forever in God's care [MUSIC] Troubles come and [MUSIC] Troubles go [MUSIC] Can't change a thing [MUSIC] By worry and soul [MUSIC] I'm kissing goodbye to [MUSIC] All my worldly walls [MUSIC] I'm forever in God's care [MUSIC] Heroes of metal [MUSIC] With our words bright [MUSIC] He's a sparrow far [MUSIC] And though he leads me [MUSIC] Through the darkest night [MUSIC] I'm sheltered in his wings [MUSIC] Protected through it also [MUSIC] Why should I worry [MUSIC] If it shines or rains [MUSIC] I'm forever in God's care [MUSIC]
[time=1351] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh [MUSIC] Why should I worry [MUSIC] If it shines or rains [MUSIC] I'm safe and warm [MUSIC] Under his wings [MUSIC] I'm in no hurry [MUSIC] For an earthly thing [MUSIC] I'm sure in no hurry [MUSIC] For an earthly thing [MUSIC] Forever in God's [MUSIC] Forever and forever in God's care â™ª
[time=1433] (audience applauding) - Thank you very much, ladies.
[time=1447] It's beautiful singing.
[time=1449] You'll forever be remembered by me for your roles and filler on the roof.
[time=1453] That's when I first met them.
[time=1455] And as I see them up here singing, I keep seeing them there in their parts, you know, in that wonderful musical.
[time=1460] Why should I worry whether it shines or rains, they sing?
[time=1463] And I guess if you live in Indiana, you probably shouldn't.
[time=1466] (audience laughing) No sense getting worked up over something you have absolutely no control over.
[time=1470] Now, you got to help me out about the weather.
[time=1473] Everybody says this phrase to me.
[time=1475] If you don't like the weather in Indiana, don't worry about it.
[time=1478] Just wait.
[time=1480] Now, some people say an hour and it'll change.
[time=1482] Other people tell me it's 15 minutes, but my experience says it's about five minutes and it changes.
[time=1487] We need to reach some level of consensus.
[time=1489] Other people say, "Now, how do you like the weather?" And I think to myself, that's a very broad question.
[time=1494] Could you narrow some of these options down?
[time=1496] We've got sunny muggy, cloudy muggy, early morning muggy, late afternoon muggy.
[time=1501] (audience laughing) All I know is that when I was driving home on Thursday from work, I turned on the radio and I heard some words I'd never heard before in California.
[time=1511] It's said to be caution for severe thunderstorm warnings.
[time=1516] See, these are new words to me.
[time=1519] By the end of the evening, my wife and I were huddled around the family Bible, digging around in early Genesis, looking for that verse about the rainbow.
[time=1527] (audience laughing) God, tell me where I promise.
[time=1530] Remember now, promise.
[time=1533] You know, we get about one thunder every five years in California.
[time=1538] And it's like a peak compared to what was happening on Thursday night.
[time=1543] What happens is we're alive.
[time=1546] We're still alive and we're back in church this morning so we can study God's word together.
[time=1551] Why don't you take your Bibles and open the first Peter, first Peter chapter two, and we'll continue in our study.
[time=1558] These very important and vital verses.
[time=1562] First Peter chapter two, we began last week.
[time=1565] We'll conclude this week, verses one through three.
[time=1567] Let me read you follow along.
[time=1570] Therefore, putting aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the word that by it you may grow and respect to salvation if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
[time=1588] We've been focusing in on this word longing.
[time=1591] And it describes for us the passions and the cravings and the longings of life which are really a gift of God.
[time=1598] They are a gift that He has given to the human beings such that we can set our affection on things.
[time=1602] It brings color into our lives and it's a blessing to have been created so.
[time=1608] But we're reminded that it's all too important how we direct and where we allow these affections and longings and cravings to find their direction.
[time=1618] For if we set them on the wrong things, they will produce sin in our lives.
[time=1623] We can even be put in bondage to our own passions and eventually death, especially for the unbeliever, or I should say only for the unbeliever.
[time=1631] The process of passions unbridled bringing forth sin and then bondage and it leads them to their death.
[time=1638] But for we who are believers and we who would know the power of Christ, we are given the choice and the opportunity and the privilege to set our affections, to set our longings, to set our cravings for the word of God, the pure milk of the word of God.
[time=1653] From that we'll find freedom and light.
[time=1657] The question though is how do we do that?
[time=1660] We know ourselves so well, we find that our passions are easily misdirected and misplaced.
[time=1666] So the question how can I rekindle my passion for the word of God as it has been instructed to be in this passage?
[time=1673] And we looked at the word growth.
[time=1675] Verse two, like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the word that buy it, you may grow and respect the salvation.
[time=1682] And I suggested that the first principle that this passage reveals to us in rekindling our desire and longing for the word of God is found when we set relational goals for our life.
[time=1694] True growth, true maturity in the Christian life is best measured by our maturity in relationships.
[time=1701] We know that because in verse one it has five relational terms, therefore like a filthy garment, take it off, lay it aside, all your relational sin, your malice, your guile, your hypocrisy, envy and slander.
[time=1716] Here is described our motives in impure relationship and our behavior in impure relationships.
[time=1722] And that's all strengthened by what comes before it.
[time=1725] Up in verse 22 of chapter one, the beginning of the paragraph, even though it's a chapter break, but the paragraph really starts up in verse 22.
[time=1732] Since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls, that's the salvation experience. Why?
[time=1739] For a sincere love of the brethren fervently love one another from the heart.
[time=1747] I found that is the most difficult and highest and proper and true standard of Christian maturity.
[time=1753] It's much easier to set and attain other goals.
[time=1757] It's much easier to be faithful in ministry, to maintain a certain quiet time schedule, to acquire some knowledge from the Word of God, to hold some position of leadership.
[time=1768] It's much easier to do those things than to do what this verse is talking about, to fervently love one another from the heart.
[time=1774] You don't think so, ask Jesus.
[time=1776] He came for the purpose of fervently loving from his heart, and it cost him his life.
[time=1782] We see him in agony in the Garden of Gethsemane before the great moment of sacrifice, and he's literally sweating drops of blood.
[time=1790] There is no more difficult task, no more trying reality than living for other people, and giving your life away day in and day out.
[time=1799] And no standard could be more revealing of our shortcomings and exposing our weaknesses and humiliating us than to say that what we are to do is love like Jesus' love.
[time=1808] And when that is our standard, when we have set relational goals, we will find ourselves crawling back to the Word of God to their find the strength and the encouragement and the direction to do that some more, to continue on to live as Jesus lived.
[time=1822] Well also, allow us to come to the Word of God with proper and pure motives.
[time=1828] A lot of times we'll go to the Word of God with less than best motives because your parents went to the Word of God, and so you do.
[time=1836] Because your youth director encourages you to have a quiet time.
[time=1840] Because you're superstitious, and you're hoping that by flopping your Bible up and reading a particular verse, you'll find just the blessing that you need for that particular day.
[time=1848] Going to the Bible educationally, looking to learn some particular thing in biblical history, or denominationally, running around looking for proof text to support your particular denomination's viewpoint on some doctrinal issue.
[time=1861] Professionally, in order to be ready to preach a sermon, intellectually to satisfy some inquisitive question about the Bible, or about the flood, or about some miracle.
[time=1871] These aren't all in and of themselves wrong, but they're not why we're to go to the Word of God.
[time=1876] Matthew 22, Jesus says that the all the law, everything that's ever been written, old testament and new testament, can be kept and is to point and direct us toward the love of God and loving our neighbor.
[time=1889] So with the deep resounding conviction of our failure to love as Jesus has loved in desperation with a bleeding heart, we cry out to God and return in our longing for His Word.
[time=1903] And that brings us to our second point.
[time=1906] First, setting relational goals.
[time=1908] Secondly, seeking spiritual nourishment.
[time=1916] The word "long" here in our text has been translated in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament in Psalm 42.
[time=1923] It's a familiar psalm to you.
[time=1925] David is found in the desert, he is found in the wilderness, and he is longing for God.
[time=1930] In fact, he's thirsting for God.
[time=1933] As the deer pants for the water brook so my soul pants for theo God, my soul thirsts for God for the living God.
[time=1942] When shall I come and appear before God?
[time=1946] Sometimes it's called longing, other times it's called thirsting.
[time=1950] Psalm 62, my soul waits in silence for God only.
[time=1954] From him is my salvation, he only is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold, I shall not be greatly shaken.
[time=1964] Psalm 63, oh God thou art my God, I shall seek thee earnestly.
[time=1969] My soul thirsts for thee.
[time=1972] My flesh yearns for thee in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[time=1979] David describes for us an experience in his own life where separated from the household of God and feeling alone and desperate and the longing of his heart here described as thirsting his best pictured or illustrated in a little deer who walks also in the wilderness and it's been a drought and there's no water and his legs you can see in your mind are wobbling and his tongue is hanging out.
[time=2000] He's about ready to die of dehydration because he's longing and panting for water.
[time=2006] David says so do I pant and thirst for the true and living God.
[time=2012] Jesus used the same word thirst.
[time=2015] John chapter 7 he says now on the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out saying if any man is thirsty let him come to me and drink.
[time=2025] He who believes in me as the scripture said from his inner most being shall flow rivers of living water.
[time=2034] That passion in the soul, that longing, that huge capacity that God has given us perfection on things is often described in terms of thirsting as if for nourishment from the very person of God or his word.
[time=2047] And that's why in our text it says long.
[time=2050] Long for the pure milk of the word.
[time=2054] Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God the spiritual nourishment is the word of God.
[time=2064] Jeremiah said much the same.
[time=2066] Thy words were found and I did eat them and they were the rejoicing of my heart.
[time=2073] Job said I have treasured the word of God more than my necessary food.
[time=2078] He knows that his spiritual nourishment is more important to him even than his physical nourishment.
[time=2085] And so Peter says long be hungry be thirsty for the spiritual nourishment which can come to you through the word of God.
[time=2094] And he goes further he draws an illustration, a universal illustration, something that works anywhere in the world.
[time=2099] Look at it verse two like new born babes.
[time=2103] He's not wanting to long for the word like a new born babe longs for the pure milk from his mother.
[time=2109] And the terms are redundant. New born means recently born.
[time=2113] And babe is the New Testament word for infant which describes a baby just out of the womb.
[time=2118] And so he says like a new born babe long for the pure milk of the word.
[time=2124] Well most of us have had the privilege of having babies in our household.
[time=2128] Their longing for the milk is instantaneous.
[time=2131] You bring them out of the womb set them on the mother's breast and they know exactly what to do.
[time=2137] They begin to feed and find nourishment.
[time=2140] Their longing is all consuming. It's all they want. That's really all they want in the world is milk.
[time=2147] They really don't care what kind of clothes you put them in, how you dress them up, mother cares, baby doesn't care.
[time=2154] They really don't care how you decorate their room whether it's a certain color or a certain style and look at this new crib and isn't this marvelous and wonderful and we got the baby's room all ready and the baby simply doesn't care. All the baby wants is his or her milk.
[time=2168] And the baby is unashamed in this, he's not complaining about that or bashful about it a bit.
[time=2174] When he wants his milk he doesn't care where you are, what you're doing, how tired you might be, it's time to be fed.
[time=2180] Stocking with Tim Teder, you know they just had their little baby girl, Rochelle.
[time=2185] And they were out and about yesterday at all these receptions with high school seniors graduating and all.
[time=2190] And finally he said it got to the point where we were in trouble and Rochelle just started to scream because she was hungry.
[time=2196] That little baby didn't care that they were at somebody else's party and it was a social gathering and there's certain rules that you should follow when at that place.
[time=2203] Just started screaming at the top of her lungs, "I'm hungry and I'm not embarrassed about that. Feed me now."
[time=2211] That's the picture.
[time=2213] That's how we are to be before the Word of God like a newborn baby who wants one thing, instinctively moving towards the milk of the Word of God.
[time=2225] And it's interesting these little babies.
[time=2228] Doctors tell us that when conception occurs and that little cell is sitting there that eventually becomes whoever it is.
[time=2235] That little cell has everything it needs.
[time=2238] Already the hair color is determined and the height of that child when full-grown is determined and the IQ is there and the gifts and talents.
[time=2245] Everything it needs is there, save one thing, nourishment.
[time=2251] The exact same thing is true of Christians.
[time=2254] When you and I are born again, when we are babes in Christ, 2 Peter 1 says that we have been given everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[time=2266] We don't need one more thing.
[time=2268] From the moment we're saved, everything we need to live and grow and prosper as a Christian and advance the kingdom of God, we have it.
[time=2275] From the point of salvation, save one thing, nourishment, nourishment.
[time=2281] The nourishment of the pure milk of the Word of God.
[time=2285] Ephesians 1 says the same thing, that we have been given everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[time=2291] And so like the baby, we are too long for the pure milk of the Word.
[time=2296] Look again at verse 2, notice he calls it a certain kind of milk, it's pure milk.
[time=2301] This is the word that describes an uncontaminated, unadulterated substance.
[time=2306] It's often used in farming products, oil or corn or grain or wine.
[time=2312] When you have pure wine or pure grain or pure oil, it's uncontaminated.
[time=2316] It's exactly what you're purchasing.
[time=2319] It's pure.
[time=2322] So I was studying this text that brought to mind an incident that happened many, many years ago.
[time=2327] And we were able to find the article about it in the Los Angeles Times, April 22nd, 1979.
[time=2333] It told the story of a horrible tragic event in world history.
[time=2338] The article is titled Baby Formula, called Third World Hazard.
[time=2344] Subtitled Improper, or impure use, often turns bottle feeding deadly.
[time=2351] It was going on then to describe the case that happened in third world countries.
[time=2356] As companies would mark it, baby formula there.
[time=2359] And the mother would leave the hospital with a gift of this baby formula and one bottle and one nipple
[time=2365] and she would return to her home and thinking it was the latest and the best would begin to mix it and use it.
[time=2370] And by the time that first supply had run out, she had run out of milk.
[time=2375] She had stopped producing milk.
[time=2377] But then she came to the horrible reality that she couldn't afford to buy more.
[time=2381] It was too expensive.
[time=2383] Half of their wages would typically go to one thing of this tin, of this formula.
[time=2389] So they barely scrape up enough to get it and then she begins many times uneducated and unable to read what it says
[time=2396] as far as directions begins to milk, excuse me, mix the formula according to its visual properties.
[time=2402] And when it looks like formula ought to look from her first experiments, then she thinks it's healthy when it turns white.
[time=2409] And she began to feed that to the baby.
[time=2412] And eventually the baby would become sick through malnutrition.
[time=2416] The article went on to say that literally millions of babies died in this very fashion.
[time=2424] A Senate Health Subcommittee hearing by Dr. Alan Jackson described two children he treated for malnutrition at a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica.
[time=2434] The 18-month-old girl weighed only eight pounds.
[time=2437] Her four-month-old brother weighed five pounds.
[time=2440] Why? Because the mother, instead of using one tin for its prescribed number of days for one child, used one tin for both of her children
[time=2450] and caused its length to go about twelve times longer than it was supposed to.
[time=2455] And the nourishment that appeared to be in that bottle wasn't there.
[time=2459] As they investigated it further, they found out that as she would mix the formula with water,
[time=2465] as is often the case in third-world countries, the water was not pure.
[time=2469] It was contaminated with human refuse.
[time=2471] And so disease was being added with the water into the formula.
[time=2475] And then these poor mothers not able to properly sterilize the bottle.
[time=2479] And so more germs are being communicated.
[time=2482] Dehydration, diarrhea, malnutrition, disease, retardation, and in many cases death.
[time=2488] Millions of them.
[time=2492] You know, the same thing happens with spiritual nourishment.
[time=2496] Did you turn to Isaiah chapter 55?
[time=2499] You'll find the heart of the prophet of God trying out as he sees this same reality happening to the souls of men
[time=2506] and noticing their eternal destiny being separated from God.
[time=2511] Isaiah 55, "Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.
[time=2516] You who have no money come by and eat, come by wine and milk without money and without costs.
[time=2524] Why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy?
[time=2529] Listen carefully to me and eat what is good and delight yourself in abundance and climb your ear and come to me."
[time=2541] All over the world, people are suckling to false doctrine.
[time=2547] Instead of spiritual nourishment, they find damning doctrine.
[time=2553] Buddha, so many years ago under his fig tree in the middle of India somewhere, sitting there for seven days, claims he reached a place called Nirvana.
[time=2562] And out of that meditation came the holy scriptures of the Buddhist religion known as the Three Baskets.
[time=2569] That's what they call their holy sacred scriptures.
[time=2571] It's eleven times larger than our own Bible.
[time=2575] Suckling the soul to the three Baskets one, they promise you will eventually reach Nirvana, defined as the absence and the extinguishing of all passion in the soul, of all hatred and of all delusion.
[time=2588] Isn't that interesting?
[time=2589] And yet we studied this morning a passage which incites us to allow our passions to settle in the things of God.
[time=2595] And then promises no passion.
[time=2598] Or they could drink from the Koran as millions and millions and millions of people are doing even this day,
[time=2605] the fastest growing religion in the world.
[time=2608] Back in 59 AD, the man Muhammad had his first vision, so to speak, where he claims messages or revelations from God were received.
[time=2618] Sometimes he heard them audibly, other times he found them in his own heart.
[time=2623] Somehow he had the ability to distinguish between his own heart and messages from God.
[time=2628] Eventually it came together and was canonized in what we call the Koran for fifth the size of our own New Testament.
[time=2637] Instead of spiritual nourishment, these millions who study it and are devoted to it and know it as well as you know your Bible,
[time=2643] find there the instruction that Jesus undeniably was not the Son of God,
[time=2649] that he is not the savior for people's sins and that he in fact was never even crucified.
[time=2655] Many of them believe that Judas was crucified in his place.
[time=2659] Damning doctrine.
[time=2662] Or we can learn from the teachings of Joseph Smith, who in his opinion rescued Christianity from 18 years of apostasy until finally God gave him new truth
[time=2673] and brought back the true gospel to Christianity which had been lost.
[time=2678] Where are we to read from the Book of Mormon or those who write about it, namely Brigham Young I quote out of his journal, "Believe in God, believe in Jesus, believe in Joseph
[time=2688] his prophet and that Brigham is his successor." And I add, if you will believe in your hearts and confess with your mouth Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph was a prophet and that Brigham is his successor.
[time=2700] You shall be saved in the kingdom of God.
[time=2704] No man or woman in this dispensation will ever enter into the celestial kingdom of God
[time=2710] without the consent of Joseph Smith.
[time=2715] People hunting looking thirsty, trying to find a place to quench the thirst that God given thirst for God himself.
[time=2722] And they grab ahold of a bottle called religion and ingest into their system of damning poison which sends them to hell forever.
[time=2731] It's a tragic scene, thirsty souls seeking nourishment find death.
[time=2739] In Zambia it is the customary practice of the people there to decorate the infant's grave with its most valuable possession.
[time=2748] There you will find many infant's graves decorated by a baby bottle.
[time=2754] That very thing which promised life, nourishment and health but brought them death.
[time=2762] And if we could go around the world today what ought to be above many people's graves would be the Koran.
[time=2768] Promising life, giving death.
[time=2772] The Book of Mormon, promising life, giving death. The three baskets, promising life, giving death.
[time=2788] But as we've had to remind ourselves so often in this study we are not exempt.
[time=2792] We are thirsty people. Yes we've been given the life of God and we are forever indebted to him for the new life that is in us as born again believers.
[time=2799] But we can be thirsty people who are made to want more of God.
[time=2804] More and more and more and more and more and more of God until finally at last when in heaven he will dwell among us and we will be satiated.
[time=2810] But until then it's a thirsty day for us.
[time=2813] And our days can be hard and they can be difficult and they can be discouraging and we can be hurt and bruised.
[time=2819] And every day, every moment of every day we have the choice where will we find our nourishment.
[time=2828] Where we be so foolish as to seek nourishment from pure relaxation, from our hobbies, from our television sets, from each other.
[time=2843] Nothing wrong with those things but when they take the place of feeding on the Word of God.
[time=2850] I even sometimes worry about all the books that are out about the Bible. They are very helpful but I have a library full of them.
[time=2856] I read them myself but sometimes I wonder if we as Christians don't lose ourselves in reading books about the Bible instead of just reading the Bible.
[time=2865] And there is lost that great commitment to sit down with the great awesome book of God and say I will now learn the book of 1 Peter.
[time=2874] And I'll read it and I'll read it and I'll read it over again and I'll memorize portions of it and I'll understand why it was written
[time=2880] and to whom it was written and the paragraphs and the chapters and the great themes and the arguments of this book.
[time=2885] And I'll walk away from this study in six months and I'll be able to tell you what is in the book of 1 Peter and what it means to me
[time=2892] and the differences that it's made in my life.
[time=2896] Now we lose that enthusiasm, we lose that commitment, we lose that direction and when we do we lose the vital nourishment that allows us to proceed in this great task of loving fervently from the heart.
[time=2914] How do I kindle my desires for the Word of God, set relational goals, 1, 2 seek spiritual nourishment and 3 stay on the proven path.
[time=2926] Stay on the proven path. Look at verse 3.
[time=2933] If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord, what he's saying is like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the Word that by it you may grow and respect the salvation.
[time=2942] If you have tasted the kindness of the Lord it could have been translated since or because you've tasted the kindness of the Lord because you've seen what he can do in your life.
[time=2952] Because you've already got some background with the Word of God and you've tasted Jesus and it was sweet and it produced the growth it said it would stay with it.
[time=2962] Stay with it, stay with the proven commodity.
[time=2966] So many times in the earlier part of our married life we would be having some important guests and I'd noticed just before they're about ready to arrive kind of a tense look on my wife's face and I'd say honey what's the matter she's old.
[time=2980] I sure hope this dish comes out and I'll say honey what do you mean she's well.
[time=2987] I've never cooked it before in my life and I'm thinking to myself why tonight.
[time=2995] Couldn't we have done this when it was just us just the family it doesn't matter if it works we'll have cereal if it doesn't work.
[time=3002] But I wanted to try something new you guys have done that too you ladies I can see that.
[time=3008] You know what let's like where's the lasagna where's the steak and potatoes where those all time ten lists that you make perfectly every time the delight of my heart we've had them before we'll have them again and we can count on them.
[time=3022] Yeah we're not the dinner tonight with somebody in our church it took us to a beautiful Italian restaurant and the menu is several pages long and there was everything you could possibly want to order in an Italian restaurant.
[time=3034] My host you know you ordered spaghetti what's your problem spaghetti look at all this stuff this is all you.
[time=3043] He says you won't believe it he says you get to know me a little better you know I always do that.
[time=3047] I'll always go the same restaurant or the same thing when I'm in this restaurant it's always this thing spaghetti every time and I promised Gary Bowman I wouldn't mention his name so I won't.
[time=3058] But you know he gives us a great lesson there's something to be said with staying with a known quantity especially when you're talking about the nourishment for your soul stay with the word of God.
[time=3071] Listen to what God is saying isn't it the word of God isn't it since you've tasted Jesus that you've come out of darkness and into life.
[time=3078] Isn't it through your relationship with Jesus as you long for the pure milk of the word that you've been transferred from death into life from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his beloved son your sinful soul has been converted.
[time=3091] A love for Christ has been put in its place a hatred for sin a desire to obey you've been granted heaven instead of hell.
[time=3099] Oh my lands why would you ever forsake the living word of God where else would you go what else is there.
[time=3109] If it isn't the powerful awesome consuming word of God.
[time=3115] Stay on the proven path would you go back again to Isaiah for a minute that same passage Isaiah 55 where he cries out with all of his heart where are you going why are you taking your thirst and your hunger
[time=3128] and spending your hard earned money to buy and to eat what does not satisfy.
[time=3134] And so he heralds his invitation to all the people who will listen come and eat from my table.
[time=3142] Verse two listen careful to me and eat what is good and delight yourself and abundance and climb your ear and come to me not turn the page if you have my kind of Bible go to verse 11.
[time=3152] And here's that famous verse so shall my word be which goes forth from my mouth.
[time=3160] It shall not return to me empty.
[time=3164] This is the powerful awesome unbelievable word of God.
[time=3170] It's alive it's active it's not just words on a page folks this is it the true inspired word of God and it will not return to him empty without accomplishing what he desires without succeeding in the matter for which he has sent it.
[time=3187] When he sends it forth into your life he wants it to produce in you a person that looks like Jesus Christ that thinks like Jesus Christ that acts like Jesus Christ and it's got the power to do that.
[time=3199] Should we long for it.
[time=3201] He compares it in verse 10 to the rain that he sends down for as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there without watering the earth and making it bear and sprout.
[time=3212] Excuse me making it bear and sprout and furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word which goes forth from my mouth.
[time=3220] Just like the rain just like the way the rain always produces what it's supposed to produce so will the word of God produce the growth in your life that he wants it to.
[time=3233] Turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 one of the happiest letters written never by the Apostle Paul he writes to one of his favorite churches a great church a strong church.
[time=3243] Here in the book of 1 Thessalonians there is really no issue at large he's not rebuking them or correcting them or trying to change some pattern of behavior he's just loving on them.
[time=3255] Says for in verse 2 chapter 1 for we give thanks to God always for all of you making mention of you in our prayers.
[time=3263] Constantly bearing in mind your work of faith your labor of love your steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ and the presence of God and Father.
[time=3272] Knowing brethren beloved by God his choice of you for our gospel did not come to you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction just as you know what kind of men we prove to be among you.
[time=3289] And as a result you became imitators of us and of the Lord having received the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in a cave not turn the page chapter 2 verse 13.
[time=3308] For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received from us the word of God's message you accepted it not as the word of men but for what it really is the word of God which also performs its work in you who believe.
[time=3326] The word of God can perform and will perform its work in you who believe your responsibility is to get it in to long for it to set your affections to it to take it into your very person let it come inside your mind and your heart and your soul and let it do its work.
[time=3346] In 1 Peter he uses a very interesting verb you want to go back there 1 Peter chapter 2 when he says like a newborn babe long for the pure milk of the word that buy it you may grow and respect to salvation it could have been it's a passive verb grow and it could have been translated that buy it you may get grown.
[time=3365] We are the passive agent here the word of God is the acting agent and it will grow you just be faithful to long for it take it in soak it up.
[time=3382] So what will you do with your passions man like riding a team of 6 white horses they get a mind of their own and we don't know where they're going how will we control our passions.
[time=3397] The answer to that question will set the course of your life will set the course of your life.
[time=3407] We've learned that the passions are to be set on God as we saw from Paul and Philippians 1 says I'm dying to die because when I die I get Christ.
[time=3416] We learned from the Apostle Paul in Romans chapter 1 and then verse also in chapter 15 I have a longing for people.
[time=3424] I have a craving inside of me to see people grow in Christ.
[time=3429] We've learned from Peter to crave the word of God to do powerful awesome cravings inside the soul of set property will give life and peace and growth and between.
[time=3444] Passions outside that ruin your life destroy your life take everything you want away.
