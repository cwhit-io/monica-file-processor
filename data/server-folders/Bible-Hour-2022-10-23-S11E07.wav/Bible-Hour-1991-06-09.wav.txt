[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - Have you ever been caught with your hand in the cookie jar?
[time=47] Caught right in the act, right in the middle of doing something wrong, whether by your spouse or your employer or a good friend.
[time=55] It's a horrible feeling, isn't it?
[time=57] And how were you treated?
[time=59] Were you punished in some way or were you given grace?
[time=62] Were you given mercy?
[time=64] Stay with us this morning.
[time=65] We're gonna talk about approaching the throne of grace.
[time=70] (dramatic music) Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship.
[time=88] Thank you for joining us.
[time=90] Pastor Moore's message today is entitled, "Approaching the Throne of Grace." His text is taken from the book of Hebrews chapter 4 verses 11 through 16.
[time=100] I'm sure that at some point in your life you have been caught with your hand in the cookie jar.
[time=105] Did you receive punishment or grace?
[time=108] Listen today as we study how we can approach the throne of grace.
[time=113] Before the message, we will be ministered to by a solo from Susan Torek Stump entitled, "Don't Let Your Heart Be Hardened." And an instrumental solo from Scott Schindler entitled, "And Can It Be?"
[time=127] Let's join our worship service as the sanctuary choir sings the song, "Our God Rains."

[time=776] We're glad that you've tuned in.
[time=778] Russell, it's great to be in the house of the Lord today.
[time=781] One of the things that's especially neat about Sunday morning is our fellowship together with the believers that come to Blackhawk Baptist Church each Sunday.
[time=789] - Well, the people of Blackhawk have been so good to us, and I know I'm making fun of the weather from time to time, and I enjoy the difference, really, from California, but we didn't come here because of the weather, obviously.
[time=799] We came here because of the people.
[time=801] And as we've initially interviewing with the process of coming to Blackhawk, we've been here, we have found the people to be so delightful, and the fellowships are very sweet.
[time=811] - Well, I know that you've gotten to know a number of people.
[time=814] There are a lot of our own folks that you need to meet yet, but I'm gonna encourage even our Bible hour viewers to write in and mention that you've watched the Bible hour and have seen our new pastor speak, and that would be a great encouragement to us.
[time=826] A little bit later, we'll be giving the address, and that'll be a great encouragement.
[time=832] Russ, I think for both of us to have them write in and tell us that they're watching the Bible.
[time=836] - Oh, I'd love to hear from them.
[time=837] It'd be great.
[time=838] Please, feel free to write and let us know how the ministry is touching your life.
[time=844] It'd be a great source of encouragement.
[time=846] - That's great.
[time=847] We'd like to tell you about an opportunity that's coming up.
[time=849] We've already talked about it on the Bible hour.
[time=851] The Patriotic Panorama.
[time=853] It's the annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=855] This is our 18th year of presenting it.
[time=857] This year, we're entitling it Main Street, America.
[time=860] It'll be on Sunday afternoon June 30th at 4 p.m.
[time=863] right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=865] There are no tickets necessary, but I hope that you will come early and join with us as we honor the men and women that have served in our country and in particular in the desert storm and then give God the glory for allowing us to live in this wonderful land of the United States of America.
[time=882] Come and join with us on Sunday June 30th for the annual Patriotic Panorama Main Street, America.
[time=888] I can guarantee you that you're going to get some goosebumps and you're just going to have pride in our country as you listen to the music and those that will be speaking on that particular day will be honoring some of our special guests and politicians that will be with us and that will be a great day.
[time=905] So come and join with us on Sunday afternoon June 30th at 4 p.m.
[time=909] Also, we've been talking about a gift offer entitled "God's Promises".
[time=914] For us, there have been a lot of self-health books.
[time=916] If you go into the local Christian bookstore, you'll just see row after row of books that are of an encouragement to Christians.
[time=923] I think that's great.
[time=924] I'm glad that they're written because they've certainly helped me.
[time=927] We have a book today called "God's Promises" that is really the word of God just organized in a little different fashion.
[time=934] Well, I've just gotten to know about it through you, Pete, and I've been looking at it in the last couple of weeks and I've ordered some.
[time=940] You know that I've asked you to order me about 50 of them because I so enjoy them.
[time=944] I think they're so helpful.
[time=945] It's just the Scripture.
[time=946] It's the word of God broken down by topics and verses just one after the other giving you the opportunity to just soak in the word of God and I'm going to be sending them a set to my parents and then also to some friends of mine.
[time=957] I can hardly wait.
[time=958] It's a great book.
[time=959] We want to encourage you today to write for it.
[time=961] You can receive it absolutely free if you'll write to the Bible Hour today and just ask for the booklet "God's Promises".
[time=967] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=977] Once again, that's the Bible Hour.
[time=979] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=987] Russell, we've been talking about people in our own church that we've been praying for that have physical ailments and in particular, Greg has been ill for a number of days and months and I'm sure that there are other people even in our listening audience that perhaps need prayer and again, we'd like to encourage them to write to us because we get together as a staff and that's the time when we pray for people that really have a physical need.
[time=1014] Prayer is such a vital part of our commitment to one another and the body of Christ and I was down in Indianapolis this week visiting Greg Hindel and of course he has leukemia and we just enjoyed our fellowship so much together had a word of prayer together and daily he's on my heart and I believe that prayer makes a difference.
[time=1034] You know, I believe that God works through prayer.
[time=1036] I don't fully understand it, but I do believe that we go before our Heavenly Father and we ask for strength and encouragement and the ability to endure hardship that somehow through His Spirit He gives us that.
[time=1047] I think again, that's the beauty of being together with the body of believers is that sense of oneness that people are praying for one another.
[time=1054] So perhaps you're alone today and you have a need and you just want someone to pray for you.
[time=1059] Why don't you write to the Bible hour today and just tell us of your need and when we get together this week, we'll pray for those special needs.
[time=1066] I want to give you the address of the Bible hour once more.
[time=1068] It's just the Bible hour.
[time=1070] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1077] Or also we go back to the regular schedule portion of our program with some music and then we look forward to the message from God's Word.
[time=1094] [MUSIC - 265 seconds]
[time=1367] [APPLAUSE - 12 seconds]
[time=1383] Well, that's absolutely beautiful, Scott. Thank you very much. I had a chance to go to lunch with Scott this week.
[time=1388] We went to Taco Bell. And while we were there, I said, "Scott, when did you start taking piano lessons or organ lessons?"
[time=1396] And he said, "Well, he was four." I said, "When did you find out you were gifted at it?" He says, "When I was five."
[time=1402] I said, "Well, what was the big clue?" And he said, "When I found out that I didn't need notes to play the songs,
[time=1409] he just needs to hear the stuff, and he can go play it." You know, there's some people in the world that God gives that gift to, and to hear it is to play it, and musicians in all different kinds, pianists, organists, or whatever, and I hate all of them.
[time=1420] [LAUGHTER] I took piano lessons for about two years and found out I couldn't play with the notes.
[time=1429] [LAUGHTER] Open your Bibles this morning, the Hebrews chapter 4. Praise God for Scott.
[time=1437] And I want to talk this morning about the grace of God, approaching the throne of grace.
[time=1444] And I can hardly open the book and look at this passage without remembering.
[time=1448] An incident that happened in my family about two or three years ago, we were back in California.
[time=1452] It was when my daughters were younger.
[time=1455] And it was the evening time my wife had gone out for a well-deserved jog around the neighborhood, and the girls had been put to bed, and I was downstairs studying the Bible for a message I was preparing, and the music was on real loud.
[time=1467] I think it was the Gaither Trio or something.
[time=1470] And all of a sudden a twist of fate occurred in the household and really in the lives of my daughters,
[time=1476] because just as the tape came to a stop, and it was total silence, you heard thump, ouch, randy.
[time=1485] And see that put them in big trouble, because in my house, when it's bedtime, it's bedtime.
[time=1490] When the light goes off, the rules go on.
[time=1492] And the rules are very clear. You have already gotten a drink.
[time=1496] You've already brushed your teeth. You've already gone potty.
[time=1498] You've already done all the things you need to do.
[time=1500] There is no getting out of bed, no talking, no whining, no crying, no playing, and certainly no hitting.
[time=1505] And so as I'm getting up, you know, to go up there and find out what's going on.
[time=1509] And by the way, I had to build triple-decker bunk beds.
[time=1512] I had three daughters, you know, that needed to live in the same room.
[time=1515] And so I built these triple-decker bunk beds, and Kelly was on the bottom our youngest, and Randy, our eldest, was up here, and the Nikki kind of came in this way.
[time=1522] And so I'm on my way up the stairs, and I'm thinking, you know, when I got home tonight, my wife reminded me that the girls had not been very good.
[time=1529] They've been pushing the boundaries all day long, and she had encouraged me to find some reason to spank them for something. Anything.
[time=1538] And I thought to myself on the way up the stairs, this is it, I've got them.
[time=1542] If I could just figure out who did what, get these, you know, infractions clear in my mind I could discipline with the rod, and they'd be in better shape.
[time=1551] Well, I get to the door up there in their bedroom, and they're, you know, literally almost jumping out of their bunk beds, trying to give me their version of the story.
[time=1557] And finally, I quiet them down, I say, Nikki, tell me what happened.
[time=1560] Well, Dad, I was just laying here, and she puts her head back, and her head is literally surrounded by stuffed animals.
[time=1567] You know, she'd haloed by stuffed animals.
[time=1569] She's always just sitting here, and I was just playing a little bit, and I asked Randy if she wanted to play, and Randy picked up that stuffed animal right there and hit me right in the head with it.
[time=1576] You see, in an effort to blame and put all the guilt on her older sister, she'd actually blamed and implicated herself, because she now admitted to having talked and requested to play.
[time=1587] Both of those are major violations after the lights go off.
[time=1591] I looked over Randy, I said, Randy, is that true?
[time=1595] Sort of.
[time=1597] As I go back to Nikki, you know, being the younger, not as bright, you always go for the weaker person.
[time=1602] I said, Nikki, what should I do now that I know that you guys have broken the rules?
[time=1611] And in her innocence, she said, well, give us a spanking, and then she realized what she said, she grabbed her bottom.
[time=1619] And then she did something.
[time=1622] She looked at me and she said, but Dad, you could give us mercy.
[time=1630] It's a new thought for me.
[time=1634] I guess I could have, and I kind of felt like Octavian and Fiddler on the Roof where the seconds turned to minutes, and I said, well, you know, on the one hand, and I'm just doing this all in my brain, and they must have wondered what happened to me, because I'm kind of gone now, and I'm thinking, on the one hand, you know, my love requires that they know there is discipline, and there are consequences to disobedience.
[time=1653] I need to train them up in the discipline of the Lord, you know?
[time=1656] But on the other hand, just look at them there in their bunk beds.
[time=1660] I mean, that beautiful brown hair flowing down over their shoulders in those pink nighties and those big eyes just pleading with me for mercy.
[time=1668] But then on the other hand, what happens if that plead for mercy is nothing but a well disguised ploy of manipulation?
[time=1675] And they have me wrapped around their little fingers now, and they hope they'll have me there when they're 16.
[time=1681] But then on the other hand, what's so awfully bad about not going right to sleep?
[time=1685] Why don't we all have some cherished memories of playing with our brothers and sisters after bedtime, behind closed doors, hoping that mom and dad won't find out?
[time=1695] But on the other hand, you know, they really do need a spanking, and it would really help the attitude, and they'd have a much better day, and Heidi would certainly have a much better day.
[time=1705] But on the other hand, if I do that, I'll have to pull them out of their bunk beds,
[time=1712] get them one by one into my room, talk to them about the thing, and then get out my leather strap and inflict pain on them. Well, I don't know if my decision was right, but I said, okay, mercy.
[time=1725] You get one more chance, but go to sleep. And they did. Thank God.
[time=1732] The text in front of us this morning is about a gracious father, not an earthly father,
[time=1738] in confusion, wondering what to do, but an all-knowing heavenly father dealing with his children.
[time=1745] It's a text about his making the choice and the provision to give and grant mercy and grace from his very throne.
[time=1755] There's something wonderful about receiving mercy, and I don't know, a situation in your life might bring you to the place where you have been caught with your hand in the cookie jar, so to speak.
[time=1764] You may be a prime candidate for judgment, either from God or from an employer or from a wife or from a husband whom you violated and have wronged, and they are in the deliberation process of either granting or not granting you mercy and grace.
[time=1780] But it is certainly a wonderful phenomenon that God has brought into our lives and the idea of mercy and grace.
[time=1786] And this morning, let's look at it in three under three headings, three main points.
[time=1791] Approaching the throne of grace, one, his perfect knowledge of our situation.
[time=1797] Two, his provision in a high priest, and thirdly, his promise of mercy and grace.
[time=1804] First, his perfect knowledge of their situation, verses 12 and 13.
[time=1810] The word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[time=1824] What he is saying to his readers is that by the power of my word, I know exactly the state of your spiritual condition.
[time=1832] I know the condition of your soul. I know the condition of your spirit.
[time=1836] I know all your thoughts. I know all the intentions of your heart. You are an open book to me.
[time=1842] In fact, verse 13 supports that by saying that there is no creature hidden from his sight.
[time=1847] All things are open and laid bare. The word open means naked.
[time=1852] It's as if you have no clothes on and God is looking at you and you have nothing to cover yourself with.
[time=1858] He sees it all. He sees every aspect of your spiritual condition.
[time=1863] In other words, laid bare. It's a word that means to bend back the neck.
[time=1869] It's a word from which we get our word tracheus or tracheotomy, the neck or the throat.
[time=1874] It was used two ways in ancient days, one of a wrestler who would finally grab his opponent by the neck
[time=1881] and have him face to face in Mortal Kombat.
[time=1885] Face to face in Mortal Kombat. He's got him by the neck.
[time=1889] He's laid bare at that point. The other place it was used was in the context of a courtroom
[time=1895] and when they would bring a witness to the stand and they wanted to hear what the witness had to say before they let the witness testify, they would lay his neck back or his head back and expose his neck
[time=1905] and then affix a dagger right below his chin such that when he lowered his neck back down, it would sit right there.
[time=1913] Because when he was giving testimony, they didn't want him dropping his head.
[time=1917] They want him to have to face the accuser, face the jury.
[time=1923] It emphasizes both of these words do and open face to face nothing barred, nothing hidden, open manifestation of what was really going on.
[time=1935] That's God's understanding of these people's spiritual situation.
[time=1939] What was their situation? What does he reveal to them about their spiritual situation?
[time=1944] Well, the book of Hebrews tells us many things. You might come with me to chapter 2 for a minute and find that they are people who have heard the gospel.
[time=1952] Verse 3, chapter 2, after it was at first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard.
[time=1960] God also bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his own will.
[time=1967] The book of Hebrews was written to Hebrews, to Jewish people who had been raised in the trappings of the old covenant,
[time=1973] the tabernacle, the priests, the offerings, the sacrifices.
[time=1976] But somehow somebody, probably an apostle, had reached them.
[time=1980] We don't know exactly where they lived. We think this group of believers was located in Italy.
[time=1984] And somebody, probably an apostle who had seen these signs and these wonders and these miracles,
[time=1990] came to them and said, "You know what? The completion of all the Old Covenant, the Old Testament is come.
[time=1995] The Messiah is here and they gave testimony to the gospel of Jesus Christ." A great number of them, chapter 3, verse 1, made a profession of faith.
[time=2005] Therefore, Holy Brotheran, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.
[time=2013] They had made a confession and were therefore called Holy Brotheran.
[time=2018] Now it's important to note, as you study this book, that not all of these Jews who had left Judaism
[time=2024] on a profession of faith in Jesus Christ were truly saved.
[time=2028] Some of them had become truly born again and were regenerate believers.
[time=2033] But there was a group in this larger group that weren't truly saved.
[time=2037] They had just been caught up in the whole thing and said, "Well, if the Messiah has come, then we'll go with you guys into Christianity and we'll make a profession of faith." But they weren't truly saved.
[time=2049] This group of people had even suffered hardship.
[time=2052] Go over to chapter 10 for a minute. You'll find a description that they had suffered for the cause of Christ.
[time=2057] Chapter 10, verse 32.
[time=2059] Remember the former days when after being enlightened you endured a great conflict of suffering,
[time=2065] partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
[time=2073] For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property knowing that you have for yourselves a better position and an abiding one.
[time=2082] This is a description of both the true believers and those who were along for the ride, but they had so identified themselves with Christianity that they were all getting persecuted.
[time=2091] So the condition of their souls, they had come out of Judaism.
[time=2096] They had heard the truth about Jesus. They had made a profession of faith.
[time=2099] In some cases real, in some cases not real, but together and collectively, in a very hostile early church environment, they had been persecuted.
[time=2108] But now if you go to chapter 5, you'll find that they had become dull of hearing.
[time=2114] Chapter 5, verse 11.
[time=2117] Concerning him we have much to say, and it's hard to explain since you have become dull of hearing.
[time=2122] Verse 12, "For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food, somewhere in this process, somewhere in this period of time, from their first hearing about Jesus to this point, where they are now dull of hearing, and they are now retarded in their spiritual growth, and they should be teachers, but now they need milk, elementary principles.
[time=2149] They had become disillusioned in their relationship with Christ.
[time=2152] It wasn't everything it had been promised to be.
[time=2155] Somehow, possibly in their aspirations to become a Christian at this point in time would have led to all kinds of happiness and joy and fulfillment, and everything was supposed to be coming up roses, and instead they got persecution, and it was hard and difficult, and living the life of a Christian wasn't all that they maybe thought it was.
[time=2171] And so there is disillusionment and dull of hearing, and there is a retardation, if you will, of spiritual growth.
[time=2179] God knew it all.
[time=2183] God saw it completely.
[time=2185] Not just in general principles as is being described here, but as we go back to Hebrews chapter 4 in the life of each individual one of these people, whether saved or just professing faith,
[time=2195] he knew the condition of their soul, their spirit, their thoughts, their intentions, they were laid bare, they were naked, they were face to face with the true and living God.
[time=2204] He knew their spiritual condition, and five times in this book he brings tremendous warning of judgment,
[time=2210] of damnation.
[time=2212] One of them could be found if you turn back to chapter 2.
[time=2216] He says, "Listen to me now, verse 1, for this reason you must pay much closer attention to what you've heard
[time=2222] after you drift away from it," and he's not talking about slipping into disobedience momentarily.
[time=2227] He's talking about turning away from Christ as evidenced by verse 3.
[time=2230] How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?
[time=2234] You've had the gospel, you've had the truth.
[time=2237] You're the chosen race raised in a divine Old Testament religious system, but you've come to know the person of Jesus at least intellectually.
[time=2244] And now through all of these circumstances dull of hearing, and if you continue on and prove that you're not truly saved, you'll be damned forever.
[time=2253] Five different times in this book actually, these warning passages are brought to bear on their minds.
[time=2261] In addition to that, there is the greatest chapter on discipline anywhere in all the Bible found in Hebrews chapter 12,
[time=2268] and that chapter is written to those who truly were sons of God.
[time=2272] They really were partakers, they weren't illegitimate. Hebrews chapter 12 verse 8.
[time=2278] But if you are without discipline of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
[time=2284] He's speaking to those who have truly come to faith.
[time=2286] I'm going to discipline you if you continue to live this way.
[time=2289] I will punish you.
[time=2292] Verse 5, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord or fate when you are reproved by him.
[time=2298] For those whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and he scourges every son whom he receives." So both groups are in hot water with God many, many different times in this book because of their spiritual condition.
[time=2310] But the passage in front of us this morning is not a warning passage and it's not a discipline passage.
[time=2316] This is one of those refreshing New Testament passages which knows the condition of your soul to be less than what God would have it,
[time=2324] and instead of discipline, instead of damnation, mercy and grace are offered to help in your time of need.
[time=2333] He says, "Come to me. Come to me." Why? Because I have point 2 made provision for your condition in a high priest.
[time=2341] I have made provision. Let's look at verses 14 and 15.
[time=2345] Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, I'd let us hold fast our confession for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
[time=2357] but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.
[time=2362] What's he saying at the front of verse 14?
[time=2364] Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.
[time=2370] His readers are thinking back to their understanding of the high priest's office, and probably back to the great day of atonement, Yom Kippur, when the high priest, the great high priest in their day and age,
[time=2382] the highest of all the priests would make sacrifice first for himself, Leviticus 16, and then he would enter in to the temple.
[time=2389] And he would go through a door into the outer court and then through another door into the holy place, and then through another, not a door this time, but the very veil that was rent at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and go into the holy of holies where the Shekinah glory resided, where the ark of the covenant was in the mercy seat, and he would very quickly and very expeditiously and very reverently sprinkle the blood and make atonement for the nation, and then he would immediately leave,
[time=2412] and he was not allowed to go back for another year.
[time=2416] That's their understanding of a high priest and his way to make atonement for sins, but what this passage is saying, since verse 14, we have a different kind of great high priest.
[time=2427] He's passed not through the tabernacle, but through the heavens Jesus, the very Son of God.
[time=2434] 2 Corinthians 12 talks about the third heaven, the heavens through which Jesus passed, and that is the place of God's abode, the third heaven, the very residence of God, not through the temple into the Shekinah glory, but into the heavens where God himself resides.
[time=2448] That's where Jesus went.
[time=2451] And unlike your high priest who, according to Leviticus 16, had to stop first and make sacrifice for his own sins, look at Hebrews chapter 7, verse 26, it was fitting that we should have such a high priest
[time=2462] because he's holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens.
[time=2470] He does not need daily like those high priests to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did once for all when he offered up himself.
[time=2482] Turn over to chapter 9 for a minute, look at verses 11 and 12.
[time=2488] He didn't go with the blood of animals, but his own blood.
[time=2492] When Christ appeared, verse 11, as a high priest of the good things to come, he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say not of this creation and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood he entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. And then go to chapter 10, verse 12.
[time=2513] When he was finished, he was finished. It wasn't day after day and year after year, and it wasn't a need to quickly leave the Shekinah glory. He just sat down there.
[time=2523] 10, 12, but having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, he sat down at the right hand of God.
[time=2531] The writer says to these Hebrews who were living in a very hostile day and a very uncertain day in a day in which the Bible had not yet been canonized.
[time=2539] And they had left all the family, all their friends, all their tradition, even a divine religion.
[time=2544] Remember, they didn't come out of paganism. The Judaism system of old was given to them by God.
[time=2550] But men had come and told the story of Jesus, and they had made confession of faith and gone on even to suffer for his sake.
[time=2557] But now they're wondering and they're questioning that I make the right decision.
[time=2561] Is this Christianity stuff really what it's supposed to be?
[time=2565] And God says, "I know what you're thinking. I know your questions. I know your heart. I know your confusion."
[time=2572] But let me describe for you again your high priest, your great high priest.
[time=2577] Hold fast. Look at verse 14. Hold fast to your confession. Don't let go of Jesus.
[time=2582] You let go of Jesus. You let go of everything. He is everything you need for salvation. Don't let go.
[time=2590] Don't go back. Don't drift away. Hang on.
[time=2594] Then he goes on in verse 15.
[time=2597] "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin."
[time=2605] There's almost a rebuttal here. Look at it, verse 15. It's almost set as if to refute some argument.
[time=2610] For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses.
[time=2614] It's a difficult concept for the Jew to take a hold of the idea that they're God.
[time=2620] You see, if this great high priest is so different, if he's really God and it's his own blood that makes the atonement and it's once and for all and there's no need for anymore, if he's truly God then how can he sympathize with me?
[time=2631] How can he sympathize with my weaknesses?
[time=2635] It's a tough concept for a Jewish person to apprehend because their understanding of God so shaped by the older, if you will, dispensation.
[time=2644] When they think of God, and we could go anywhere in the Old Testament probably and support this reasoning, but my mind went to Exodus chapter 19 on Mount Sinai.
[time=2652] When they think of God, God said, "I'm going to show up, but first you wash your clothes.
[time=2656] You're all filthy dirty. You get prepared." And then build a fence around the bottom of Mount Sinai because if anybody touches the mountain, even man or animal will have to stone and kill them.
[time=2665] I am a holy and a righteous God.
[time=2668] They don't see a God that is sympathetic and understanding human emotion.
[time=2672] They see a righteous, holy, violent God.
[time=2676] So it came about on the third day when it was morning that there was thunder and lightning flashes and a thick cloud upon the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound so that all the people who were in the camp trembled,
[time=2687] he terrified them.
[time=2689] Moses brought the people up out of the camp to meet God and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
[time=2693] And Mount Sinai was all in smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace
[time=2700] and the whole mountain quaked violently.
[time=2703] When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with thunder.
[time=2709] You see, that's their understanding of God. How can that God, be it in Jesus, sympathize with me?
[time=2716] Awesome, holy, righteous God that terrifies us throughout our generations.
[time=2722] Then they said to Moses, the next day, "Speak to us yourselves and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us lest we die."
[time=2729] They were terrified for their life. They don't understand. Help me, please.
[time=2734] How can this true and living God in the form of human flesh sympathize with me?
[time=2738] And he's saying, "Listen, that's the point.
[time=2741] Jesus can sympathize with your weaknesses." The word weakness doesn't mean sin. It can mean sin, but it doesn't have to.
[time=2749] It just means that frail condition of being a human being, of being a dependent creature, and Jesus became one.
[time=2756] He became flesh and he knew what it meant to be hungry and he knew what it meant to be thirsty and he knew what it meant to suffer physical exhaustion.
[time=2763] Those are the physical pains of life, but you and I know the real hurts in life come from the people we care about.
[time=2769] He understood all that stuff. He came unto his own and his own what?
[time=2774] Received and not. Isaiah 53 tells us that we did not esteem him.
[time=2779] We as a human race did not recognize.
[time=2781] Here comes the Lord of Lord and King of Kings, the God of all creation, the sustainer of the universe, and everybody just hit the deck and prostrate worship because Jesus came through the door.
[time=2791] That's how it should have been every time anybody saw him, but instead they said, "We know who you are.
[time=2797] You're Jesus of Nazareth. We knew your Father." What are you talking about, these things of God?
[time=2804] Be quiet, little boy. I'm going to go talk to my rabbi.
[time=2809] He was missed completely by a people for whom he took the form of human flesh and came to die and they never once recognized him for who he was.
[time=2819] It's a painful thing.
[time=2825] I was traveling down this week to see Greg Hindel down in Indianapolis and we left early.
[time=2830] Steve Longbreak and I did early in the morning to visit him.
[time=2833] We were hungry and so we stopped at a little truck stop somewhere along the way and a lot of trucks there so we figured it would be good food.
[time=2840] I had to make a phone call right there in the foyer before I got into the actual restaurant where Steve was sitting, but finally I caught up and I sat down and the waitress comes up to me and she looks at me and she says,
[time=2854] "Are you on TV?"
[time=2860] I thought to myself, "Yes! That's me!" And I was ready for this woman to tell me all about how she's come to Christ through my preaching only in three Sundays and her life is radically transformed and God is using you in my life.
[time=2874] But I don't say all that to her, I just say, "Uh-huh." And she looks at me again and she says, "Yeah, I know who you are. You're happy the hobo."
[time=2895] "Yeah, you're happy the hobo." About God, I've been slapped the woman right across the face.
[time=2905] You know, and that could be sin, right? If you want to be famous and everybody, that could be sin, but there's something about just wanting to be recognized for your ministry and all.
[time=2914] I mean, God said I am, which means we can say I am too, right?
[time=2921] It's about ten minutes until I figured out that Steve Longbreak had set her up to it while I was on the phone.
[time=2929] What a friend I have in Jesus anyway.
[time=2935] We had so much fun. He's a great guy.
[time=2941] You see, Jesus knows all about that kind of stuff. And that's a fun, positive illustration of ways in which our life sometimes isn't all we want it to be and the pain of relationships and being misunderstood and being let down and things are not working out the way you want it.
[time=2954] And even on the way to visit a family whose son is sick, Jesus understands that stuff. Jesus sympathizes with that.
[time=2963] The word sympathy means to suffer along with, because he came down here and took a hold of human flesh and lived our life with us. Awesome Savior, because of that he can identify with us.
[time=2979] You probably had an experience similar. Many years ago, I was a traumatic time in my life four or five years ago and I felt like my life was coming apart and I was discouraged and disillusioned and I lost my vision and I wondered what I was doing.
[time=2990] And I guess I even considered leaving the ministry and I didn't want to, man, what in the world go on and you know those feelings.
[time=2996] And I was working at the Masters College and I went into my boss's office, Dr. Bob Provost, who I've told you before, has been such a tremendous friend in my life.
[time=3004] But I said, Bob, can I talk to you? And I had no appointment. I don't know what he was doing. He was always incredibly busy.
[time=3012] Here he did. Got up out of his chair. Walked over to the door and shut it.
[time=3018] Pulled up a chair right in front of mine, sat down, looked me right in the eyes and said, "What would you like to talk about?"
[time=3028] And I began to tell him my story and my emotions and my discouragement and my sense of disillusionment and he just kept going, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
[time=3039] And then I paused. I was just taking a breath but he finished my sentence the exact way that I had in my mind to finish it where I could continue.
[time=3047] And then he spent about three or four minutes describing the bigger picture of discouragement and how he'd had his own life and what it was.
[time=3053] And it just, man, by the time he was finished talking, I had tears in my eyes, not because he'd solved my problem, but because he understood my problem.
[time=3062] Boy, there's nothing like it. That's Jesus. That's Jesus. See? He understands your problem.
[time=3070] He sympathizes with your weakness. He cares. He has nothing better he'd rather do than sit and talk to these people about the disillusionment they're finding in their Christianity in a very difficult and hostile world.
[time=3085] See, we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weakness but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.
[time=3095] He never succumbed. He never fell. He never gave in. He's experienced every temptation to its ultimate pressure.
[time=3103] Something you and I rarely do. We tend to give in. We have breaking points and so we never feel the full fury of the storm, if you will.
[time=3111] We're like the tree who in the storm, when the winds get going about 35 miles an hour and the pressure's stiff, we hang in there, but when it goes to 40, we're gone, man.
[time=3119] We just come out. Our roots come up. We fall. But Jesus is like the big, strong tree that says, blow wind.
[time=3127] Give me all you got. And as strong as the storm can rage, Jesus sat there and took all the temptation and yet was without sin.
[time=3136] He's seen it all the way to its nth degree of temptation and not once did he give in. He knows what you are feeling.
[time=3145] He knows where you're at and he cares. He sympathizes. Emotionally, he's with you. He loves you. He understands you.
[time=3158] So the approaching the throne of grace, his perfect knowledge of your situation, his perfect provision in a high priest, and lastly, his promise of mercy and grace.
[time=3175] His promise of mercy and grace. Look at it, verse 16. Let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need.
[time=3187] It's amazing to me. You see, he knows everything about me, verses 12 and 13. He's got me totally figured out.
[time=3194] I can't bamboozle him. I can't hide anything from him. I can't justify my behavior. I can't talk him into seeing it from my point of view.
[time=3201] I'm just naked before him, face to face. He sees it all. He sees me at my worst. He sees me like nobody else in the world sees me.
[time=3210] And at my worst, he looks at me and opens his arm and says, "Come here." I want to give you something. It's called grace.
[time=3219] Forgiveness, complete and total pardon. And I want to give you so much grace and so much mercy that will help you in this your time of need.
[time=3231] And I don't know where that kind of love comes from, other than God himself.
[time=3237] Will you notice that he does not say to wallow in your pity, to wallow in your sin, to wallow in your spiritual?
[time=3244] Do you ever wallow in your spiritual condition when you're a little bit off with God and you begin to rake yourself up one side and down the next?
[time=3251] I'm no good. I'm of no value. I always mess up. Nobody loves me. You get yourself so depressed. All you want to do is get something to eat and then take a nap.
[time=3260] He doesn't say to do that. He also does not say to excuse it. You know your spiritual condition. You know you're at a fellowship with me.
[time=3269] You know your life is not heading in the right direction. Excuse it. It's okay. Don't worry about it. The blood takes care of it.
[time=3276] Now he says draw near to me. Come to me. Face to face. Man to man. Woman to God. Let me talk to you. Let me have you approach my throne of grace out of your sense of dependence and humility and broken-heartedness and I will give you grace.
[time=3293] I will give you mercy. Notice also he doesn't say to distract yourself.
[time=3299] When you're realizing that you're out of fellowship with God to run off into some hobby or to run off into some athletic endeavor or to run off into something somewhere so you don't have to be aware of how spiritually out of tune you are.
[time=3314] And he certainly doesn't say to redouble your efforts. Doesn't say anywhere in this passage. When you're all messed up and you know I know you're all messed up. Try harder.
[time=3325] Double your efforts. Work harder at it. Now there are places in Scripture that in course tell us to do that. Paul says over in Corinthians that he buffets his body and makes it slave less possibly after he preached he should be disqualified.
[time=3338] Oftentimes the Bible tells us to work and to work hard and to be diligent. But not here except to be diligent to enter his rest to be receiving his grace.
[time=3356] You know I don't know what background you come from. I doubt that you're out of the Hebrew faith so to speak.
[time=3366] But maybe your situation is similar. Maybe you've come out of a different lifestyle and somebody came into your life and told you about Jesus and you said yeah that's where I want to go.
[time=3376] And you've been going there but you've suddenly become dull of hearing and your growth has been retarded. And you should be a teacher now but you need to be fed with milk on the elementary principles of this world.
[time=3395] Man isn't that great? God knows that. You know what he's saying to you today? He's saying come here. I understand that. I accept that. I love you. I've made provision for it.
[time=3406] Now come to my throne and I'll give you some more grace and we'll keep going. Amazing.
[time=3413] And maybe you're here today and you know that you made only a profession of faith and it wasn't true salvation and you've been caught up in the big thing called Blackhawk.
[time=3421] Or the bigger thing called Christianity and you've been running along with this stuff and you know in your heart that you're not truly saved. You're not truly born again. God says the exact same thing to you today.
[time=3432] I know that. He says I know the true condition of your heart. You're not fooling anybody. Maybe your wife. Maybe your neighbor. Not me.
[time=3439] Come and find grace. What the hell?
[time=3449] We've been sharing with you music from our sanctuary choir, organist Scott Schindler and soloist Susan Stump. The message today was from our pastor, Pastor Russell Moore.
[time=3460] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior I'd like to take a moment and pray this very important prayer with you.
[time=3469] Dear Heavenly Father, today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart. I know that I've sinned against you and my heart is black because of it.
[time=3479] I ask you to come into my heart today because of the blood that you shed for me and be my Savior. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3489] If you prayed that prayer with me this morning would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
