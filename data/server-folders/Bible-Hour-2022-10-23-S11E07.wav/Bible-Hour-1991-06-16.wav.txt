[time=0] Have you ever been caught up in the current at a strong rushing river where you're actually
[time=6] propelled even against your will to go somewhere you don't want to go?
[time=11] Stay tuned this morning.
[time=12] We're going to be talking about the reign of sin and the reign of grace.
[time=16] Two powerful rushing rivers, if you will.
[time=20] Sin leads to death and judgment, the other life and forgiveness in the grace of God.
[time=39] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=44] Thank you for joining us.
[time=46] Pastor Moore's message today is entitled Understanding the Power of Grace.
[time=51] His text is taken from the Book of Romans 8 verses 29 and 30.
[time=58] Our special music today includes two songs from celebration.
[time=63] Let's join our service with a song from the ladies' chorus entitled God Exalted Him.
[time=90] [MUSIC]
[time=120] Our symbol, our mentor, our lowly servant, rejected by his own.
[time=133] God, let's all believe in Him, God, let's all believe in Him, and let's give a give, a give, a give, a give of our name.
[time=151] Can every lead you know, give every hand and hand alone. Can every tongue and desert Jesus Christ his own.
[time=181] [MUSIC]
[time=188] We came a man, Christ we came a man, whose destiny was led the one and three.
[time=208] Still we came a man, our gentle loving men, our men of sorrow, our great and with grief,
[time=226] God, let's all believe in Him, God, let's all believe in Him, and let's give a give, a give, a give of our name.
[time=244] Let every lead you know, give every hand and desert Jesus Christ his own.
[time=261] God, let's all believe in Him, God, let's all believe in Him, and let's give a give, a give, a give of our name, God, let's all believe in Him.
[time=278] Can every lead you know, give every hand and desert Jesus Christ his own.
[time=297] Can every tongue and desert Jesus Christ his own. He is home, He is home.
[time=328] Again, we thank the ladies for proclaiming the Christ that died on a cross for our sins and gave us eternal life.
[time=336] Let's continue with music now as we sing, "Stayed upon Jehovah, Him number 494, like a river glorious 494."
[time=346] [MUSIC]
[time=362] One more river glorious, He's not buried in peace, Lord, how it's all yours in His writing breeze.
[time=379] One hand is broken, all of every day, every hand, all of every day.
[time=396] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=524] Thank you very much for your good singing. We continue with music now as celebration comes.
[time=529] A very jubilant song talking about the time when we'll rise together with Jesus. Listen to them as they sing for us right now.
[time=544] [MUSIC]
[time=558] Every day I'm still waiting, every moment's dissipating when the Lord will come again with a shout.
[time=566] Oh glory, Hallelujah, no, this is no loosener than his word tells me he'll come to take us out.
[time=574] We're going to rise like the morning sun. We're going to rise with the Holy One.
[time=583] We're just waiting for the save yours to come any day. With the heavenly host, we're going to sail away.
[time=592] Someday we'll spin our wings to fly. Oh yes, we're going to rise.
[time=601] [MUSIC]
[time=607] Look into those heavenly portals. Today we'll be immortal where no dying pain or fear shall enter in.
[time=615] Knowing we are in his favor sitting with the Lord our Savior.
[time=620] We'll rise and learn the bridle seeds we give. We're going to rise like the morning sun.
[time=628] We're going to rise. We're going to rise with the Holy One.
[time=632] We're just waiting for the save yours to come any day. With the heavenly host, we're going to sail away.
[time=641] Someday we'll spin our wings to fly. Oh yes. We're going to rise. We're going to rise like the morning sun.
[time=654] We're going to rise. We're going to rise with the Holy One.
[time=658] We're just waiting for the save yours to come any day. With the heavenly host, we're going to sail away.
[time=667] Someday we'll spin our wings to fly. Oh yes. We're going to rise. Oh yes. We're going to rise.
[time=687] [APPLAUSE]
[time=693] Hello and welcome again to the Bible Hour. We're glad that you've tuned in today.
[time=697] This is another day that the Lord hath made and we're rejoicing here.
[time=701] We have the opportunity to present the gospel not only in our auditorium here but across the airwaves.
[time=707] Russell, it's great to be in the house of the Lord again today.
[time=709] Thank you Peter and it's a great day because it's Father's Day and I know we're all thinking about our dads.
[time=714] I called my dad last night and this is the first year out of the last six or seven that I haven't been with him on Father's Day.
[time=722] I always give him the annual Father's Day gift which is a sleeve of brand new golf balls.
[time=727] Titleist one of course because Titleist is the number one ball and it's number one on the ball because he's my number one dad.
[time=733] He's the best in the whole world. I think it's really neat that you talk about your dad that way.
[time=737] Both of our fathers are in California. I really miss mine at days like this but we'll be calling him tonight after our services.
[time=746] I feel the same way. I wrote to my dad this week and I don't usually write long letters but it just went on and on and on.
[time=753] It just took an opportunity to thank him for his genuineness.
[time=757] I really believe that he was a really consistent dad and I think that's been a great help for me in my ministry here
[time=764] and how he worked with the people he was gracious and consistent in everything he did.
[time=769] We're just thanking the Lord for our dads and grateful that we can say good things about them even today.
[time=776] For us it's patriotic panoramic time and we want to invite all of you to come to this 18th annual patriotic panorama on Sunday afternoon June 30th at 4 p.m.
[time=787] and we have a brochure here in our bulletin today that just calls it Main Street America and reminds me that that time is coming up soon Russet.
[time=795] A lot of good music, a lot of video of some of the desert storm and other encounters that we've had over the years
[time=803] and we want to honor our men and women who've served at the Armed Forces that day.
[time=808] So we want you to be joining with us on June 30th at 4 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 7400 East State right here in Fort Wayne.
[time=819] Come and join with us.
[time=821] And then last week Russ we talked about people writing in and telling us of their needs.
[time=827] We have a number of requests that were given to us even just this week and Carolyn, our coordinator of this type of event,
[time=834] listed so many that were hurting, they had physical problems, they had marital problems and we want to be sure and encourage the viewers that we are praying for them as a staff.
[time=844] Well that's really part of our ministry.
[time=846] I mean Act 6 talks about the fact that the early leaders of the early church devoted themselves to prayer and to the word and prayer is a major part of that.
[time=855] And we don't know all of your requests.
[time=857] You've sent us several and I'm sure there are hundreds for each one that's been sent in.
[time=863] But Peter and I want to pray with you this morning and just ask God who does know all the requests to have a minister in your life.
[time=869] Would you bow with us in prayer?
[time=871] Father we're so thankful for the people that you've given us to minister to through the Bible hour, the people that listen.
[time=878] And Lord for these requests that begin to come in over and over again on a weekly basis as we pray for them.
[time=884] God we know that you know the need.
[time=886] We know that you understand in a way that we would never hope to understand just what is needed by the measure of your grace.
[time=892] We pray that you will be a source of encouragement and strength to our friends even this day.
[time=899] We thank you for these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=903] Thank you Pastor Russ we appreciate that and I'm sure that the people that bow their heads and have these special needs that people that are really hurting need our prayers.
[time=913] Just before we go back to the service again we'd like to remind you that we're offering this month a booklet entitled God's Promises for Your Every Need.
[time=922] This is a booklet that just kind of divides up the scriptures.
[time=926] It's all scripture but it divides it into particular topics such as encouragement and discouragement and other things the strength of the Lord.
[time=935] So I want to encourage you to write for it. It's free. You can write to us today at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=948] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=957] We go back to the live portion of our program now as we listen to the encouraging music of celebration and then the message from our pastor.
[time=965] Stay tuned won't you?
[time=987] I'm always hurrying my way. The pace is faster, my best to last through another day.
[time=1000] I'm building up my kingdom, block by block I reach for more and dream of ways to stay ahead of where I've been before.
[time=1017] Sometimes I try to rule this form that I have claimed as mine, leaving all my thoughts of you and who you are behind.
[time=1033] But when I've got it all I've got is just a thought in time.
[time=1042] You'll still be loved, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved.
[time=1062] When the last kingdom grow more, when the last sun's set forth, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved.
[time=1081] Standing in your presence, Lord I feel how small I am.
[time=1095] My castles and thy riches are as pebbles in the sand, and I won't hold the memory of what I profess to be, unless the ones around can see the one who lives in me.
[time=1120] And understanding this, I realize my only gain is giving all I have to you to wear one and the same.
[time=1136] For when this realm of earthly kingdoms crumbles into flames, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved.
[time=1160] You'll still be loved, you'll still be loved.
[time=1168] When the last kingdom grow more, when the last sun's set forth, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved.
[time=1184] How men will cover advice, and build mansions grand and tall.
[time=1192] But when they fall, when they fall, when they fall, you'll still be loved.
[time=1208] You'll still be loved, you'll still be loved, you'll still be loved.
[time=1237] You'll still be loved, you'll still be loved.
[time=1267] Amen. You can say amen. I say amen. Good morning, everybody. Happy Father's Day to all you fellow fathers out there.
[time=1279] I woke up this morning, and my wife gave me a brand new set of golf clubs, and then my daughters gave me new golf shoes, and then my mom and dad gave me a golf membership here in town, and none of that's true, but I just thought I'd pretend.
[time=1294] Just making you jealous there for a minute.
[time=1299] That's great. If you have your Bibles with you this morning, would you open them to Romans chapter 5?
[time=1307] And I'd like to continue on in the theme of God's grace that we began last Sunday, and I had really not intended to go on like this about the grace of God, but when I got back to my study, Monday or Tuesday, and I began to think about the grace of God,
[time=1322] and got a piece of paper out and a pencil, and I just started thinking, and I've come up with a whole bunch of messages now.
[time=1328] I want to talk to you about the grace of God. They're in your bulletin. You can see approaching the throne of grace was last week.
[time=1335] Understanding the power of grace will be this week, and probably a few more, then living the life of grace, and then possessing the nature of grace.
[time=1346] The Word of God has so many wonderful things to teach us about the grace of God.
[time=1353] Romans chapter 5 verses 20 and 21.
[time=1362] The law came in that the transgression might increase, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.
[time=1371] That as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=1382] Last week out of Hebrews chapter 4, we talked about the grace of God approaching the throne of grace.
[time=1388] All was writing to the Hebrews, to a bunch of people who had left the old covenant system, and had made a profession in faith in Jesus Christ, and had embraced him.
[time=1397] Some genuinely in true salvation, others in name only, and they were just getting swept along, if you will, by the crowd.
[time=1405] But in Hebrews 4, we saw that God came to them and said, "I know the condition of your heart. I know your spiritual condition."
[time=1411] And as we saw, he described it as "less than best." But he said, "Don't fear, because I've made provision in a high priest.
[time=1419] I have a way of salvation. I have a way for you to draw near where you can come to the throne of grace and receive mercy and help in time of need."
[time=1429] The grace of God, it's a powerful, awesome thing that forgives us of our sins. It pardons us our iniquities.
[time=1437] He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[time=1443] For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his loving kindness towards those who fear him.
[time=1451] As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=1459] Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[time=1466] For he himself knows our frame. He is mindful that we are but dust.
[time=1471] The amazing forgiveness of God.
[time=1475] He knows how to let a debt go.
[time=1478] Jesus in Matthew 11 said, "Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[time=1485] The bold proclamation of the gospel knew no limits.
[time=1489] He said, "Anybody in the hearing of my voice, come to me and I will give you rest.
[time=1494] I will forgive you. I will give you grace." John 7, he said, "If any man is thirsty, let him come to me and drink, drink of the living water, the waters of eternal life."
[time=1507] To his own people in the Old Testament, God said much the same thing over and over and over again,
[time=1513] because though they were in covenant relationship with him, they continued to fail him.
[time=1517] But his grace was never ending.
[time=1520] If my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
[time=1528] then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and I will heal their land.
[time=1535] Even to we who are redeemed, who have been saved by grace, who have known and do know the forgiveness of our great God,
[time=1543] there is the promise of continual cleansing or forgiveness or washing such that our fellowship with God might stay fresh.
[time=1552] 1 John 1, 9, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, that cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[time=1563] And we would know from our own personal experience, we who are saved, we who know the Lord Jesus Christ and have experienced the mercy of God in our lives,
[time=1571] that there is no more blessed state than to be the recipient of God's grace.
[time=1576] David said it this way, "How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered?
[time=1583] How blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit?"
[time=1591] The grace of God, the pardoning grace of God, unmerited favor for by grace you have been saved.
[time=1600] He offers it to everybody, come to me.
[time=1603] And when you do come to me, he says, "I'll separate you from your sin.
[time=1607] My grace is so powerful to pardon you that it will be as high as the heavens are above the earth, as far as the east is from the west.
[time=1615] My forgiveness is so complete and so full, your sin will never again be associated with you."
[time=1625] So there is in the grace of God the power to pardon, the power to pardon, but there's more.
[time=1635] There is more to the grace of God than the power to pardon us from our transgressions, and it is the power to perfect us, to bring us to completion,
[time=1644] to move us along the road of salvation until we finally come to the great and awesome place of what the Bible calls our glorification.
[time=1654] That is because of the reign of grace.
[time=1658] The reign of grace.
[time=1660] Look again, Romans 5, verse 21.
[time=1663] There are two reigns, there is the reign of death, the reign of sin, and then there is a different reign, the reign of grace.
[time=1672] Now let me back up and explain.
[time=1675] In Colossians, Colossians 1, 13, it says that the pardoning grace of God is powerful enough to pick us up out of the domain of darkness
[time=1685] and to transfer us into the kingdom of his beloved son.
[time=1689] There is a domain, a sphere if you will, called darkness.
[time=1694] Ephesians 2, 1, gives further definition to this domain of darkness.
[time=1698] It calls it the trespasses and sins.
[time=1702] And those aren't just the individual trespasses and sins of the individual.
[time=1707] It's in the locative case which in the Greek describes a sphere.
[time=1711] It's a sphere, it's a place, it's a domain of trespass and sins.
[time=1717] Almost like our sanctuary, the floor and the ceiling and the walls create space.
[time=1724] They define space, there is a domain in here.
[time=1728] And what he says about people who are unsaved is that they are in the domain or the space or the realm of darkness
[time=1735] defined by trespasses and sins.
[time=1739] And when in that sphere or domain, the unregenerate person is under the reign of sin.
[time=1748] There is a principle that is active inside that great domain called sin.
[time=1753] It is active, it is powerful, it is destructive, it decays, it is corrupting, and it ultimately leads to death.
[time=1761] That is the reign of sin.
[time=1763] There is a dynamic within the domain of darkness that works.
[time=1767] It has energy, it has the engine of sin, if you will.
[time=1772] Ephesians 4 describes its product.
[time=1775] It causes futility of mind.
[time=1778] It brings a darkened understanding.
[time=1780] It facilitates the hardness of the heart, greater levels of the hardening of the heart.
[time=1786] Whereby people eventually give themselves over to this power of sin in their lives,
[time=1792] it says they have given themselves over to sensuality so that they can practice every kind of impurity.
[time=1800] The passage we have in front of us, Romans 5, stands at a great division in the Book of Romans.
[time=1806] Up to this point he has been describing, for the most part, the reign of sin, the power of sin in the domain of darkness.
[time=1814] Let's see a description of it. Go back with me, will you to Romans chapter 1?
[time=1819] You will find here a description of the people and the product who are under the reign of sin.
[time=1826] They suppress the truth of God in unrighteousness, verse 18.
[time=1832] It is yelled to them from the creation verses 19 and 20.
[time=1836] Verse 21, they choose not to honor him as God.
[time=1840] Verse 22, they professing to be wise, they become fools, and then they exchange the glory of the incorruptible God for an image
[time=1847] in the form of corruptible man and of birds and of four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
[time=1852] This is the unregenerate man in all of his glory.
[time=1855] This is man taking the bold evidence that there is a God and holding it down actively, suppressing that truth in unrighteousness, professing to become wise, but they become fools, and then they exchange God for the image of God.
[time=1869] The form of corruptible man, birds, and four-footed animals.
[time=1873] Now watch what God does to these people.
[time=1875] He gives them over three different times.
[time=1877] Verse 24, he gives them over to the lusts in their hearts.
[time=1881] That's just basic immorality.
[time=1885] 26, he gives them over to degrading passions.
[time=1888] That's homosexuality.
[time=1890] Women exchange the natural function for that which is unnatural.
[time=1894] In the same way, men also abandon the natural function of the woman and burn and their desire toward one another.
[time=1900] God gives them over to that stuff.
[time=1903] Verse 28, he gives them over again, this time to a depraved mind, which is divine in verse 32,
[time=1909] as a mind which no longer knows right from wrong.
[time=1913] Those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but their mind is so depraved, I add,
[time=1919] they also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[time=1923] Three times God gives them over.
[time=1925] He gives them over each time to a fuller expression of the reign of sin in their life.
[time=1931] Even for the unregenerate man, even the person who doesn't acknowledge God, there is the ministry of God in their life whereby he shores up the reign of sin in their life until they reach a certain hardness of heart, a certain point in their life where he opens the gate, if you will, and lets the reign of sin express itself a little more completely, and then a little more completely, and then fully to the point of a depraved mind.
[time=1954] It's Katie Bar the Door, it's all wide open, and the most vile expressions of sinfulness are open to our perusal in their lives at that point.
[time=1962] The reign of sin, it is not a dormant thing, it is active, it has its own drive, its own energy and the life of a human being,
[time=1971] and it ignites itself on the flesh of that human being, and it's supported by the world system in which it functions,
[time=1977] and it works to destroy, to decay and to corrupt, it is powerful, it is awesome.
[time=1983] It is described further in chapter 2, verse 5, as a stubbornness of heart, an unrepentant heart they are storing up for themselves wrath.
[time=1996] Verse 8 talks of the reign of sin as producing selfish ambition, they do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness.
[time=2006] Chapter 3, verse 14 describes further the reign of sin, and the expression of it, their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
[time=2016] Their feet are swift to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their paths, and the path of peace they have not known.
[time=2022] There is no fear of God before their eyes, that is the product of the reign of sin in their life.
[time=2031] Well you notice what goes on in verse 20, he is talking about the law of God, because by the works of the law no flesh will be justified in his sight,
[time=2041] for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
[time=2044] The point is, the law, the law of the Old Testament, the law of the New Testament was never given, so by keeping the law you could get yourself saved,
[time=2053] the law was interjected into space and time and our experience of life so that we could see the true and holy standard,
[time=2059] and in the comparison find out just how powerful the reign of sin really is in our lives.
[time=2065] Just how far we have gone down there with the reign of sin, this powerful, awesome source of destruction in our lives,
[time=2073] and hopefully confess Jesus Christ as Lord and be saved.
[time=2080] The law of sin always culminates, the reign of sin always culminates, always leads to, it is moving somewhere, it is a, it is a reign with purpose,
[time=2092] it has direction and it will culminate, and it culminates in death and judgment, death and judgment.
[time=2102] Chapter two, verse two, and we know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things.
[time=2112] Romans two eight, for those who are caught up in selfish ambition and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness, wrath and indignation.
[time=2122] Finally chapter three, verse 19 says that everybody becomes accountable to God.
[time=2130] Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law that every mouth may be closed
[time=2136] and all the world may become accountable to God for judgment.
[time=2142] This engine of sin, if you will, this destructive degrading corrupting force that is more powerful than the individual himself.
[time=2151] As it works its way out in the life of the unredeemed person ultimately leads to death, damnation and destruction.
[time=2158] It's a horrible picture, it's a terrifying picture.
[time=2162] And as I struggled in my study this week to think of an illustration the only thing I could come up with was the river Niagara.
[time=2170] And it's as if you were floating on this river, having a great time you think, enjoying your life.
[time=2178] And you have made in your mind no conscious decision to head for the falls.
[time=2183] It is not your intention to destroy yourself.
[time=2187] It is simply a nice river.
[time=2191] But the river has a current.
[time=2195] And the current is moving you inexorably towards death.
[time=2201] That is the reign of sin.
[time=2205] The unregenerate finds himself, if you will, on a little rubber raft on a mighty rushing river that has its own power and its own energy functioning within the domain of darkness.
[time=2217] And it moves them purposefully and powerfully against their will, for should they turn to struggle against it, it overpowers them until finally over the falls they go to their death.
[time=2232] But the good news is there is another domain and there is another reign inside of that domain.
[time=2241] The domain or the kingdom of his beloved son as Colossians tells us.
[time=2246] And first this pardoning grace lifts us up out of the domain of darkness and delivers us into the kingdom of his beloved son.
[time=2254] We are not left there stagnant.
[time=2256] We are not left there to fend for ourselves. Once in the kingdom of his beloved son, then the reign of grace takes over.
[time=2264] And it is as powerful. In fact, it's more powerful than the reign of sin.
[time=2269] Verse 20, the law came in that the transgression might increase, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.
[time=2276] It is a greater current. It is a stronger current. In fact, it's a different river altogether.
[time=2282] For it doesn't lead to a damning death. It leads to life and ultimate glorification.
[time=2291] The reign of grace in your life has a dynamic all of its own. It's different than your will.
[time=2296] It's different than your own energy. It's different than your own efforts to live a Christian life.
[time=2301] Within this domain or sphere of the kingdom of God, there is a principle called the reign of grace that moves you.
[time=2309] That propels you, that compels you in the direction of oneness.
[time=2317] The reign of grace rather than destruction and a degrading corrupting power that leads to death is the reign of truth and righteousness and obedience and freedom and edification.
[time=2327] And it leads ultimately to life, life eternal.
[time=2334] It's not just saying in these two verses that we are now dead to the reign of sin. That's true. We are dead to the reign of sin.
[time=2341] But we are now alive to another reign, the reign of grace.
[time=2350] That's why Paul can say in Philippians 1, 6. Probably you haven't memorized. I have a beautiful needle pointed tapestry of it.
[time=2358] This verse hangs in my home. My mom did it for me because it's my life verse.
[time=2363] I am confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=2377] Do you realize that more goes on in our salvation than pure pardon?
[time=2381] When you come to Christ, you get lifted up and deposited and now newly deposited, you find there is a whole dynamic and principle that is working in your life that's bigger and stronger than you are.
[time=2392] And so Paul says, I am confident of this very thing that he, not in me, not even in his word, not even in my efforts to grow myself up in Christ.
[time=2401] But it is this great and awesome God who began my salvation. He will perfect it. He will complete it.
[time=2409] And the theology underneath it is because I have been transferred into the kingdom of Jesus Christ where there is a new reign, a new power, a new dynamic that moves in my life.
[time=2419] It moves me towards glorification as if I were on a river out of control and being flooded down towards the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2428] It's an awesome truth. It's a powerful reality.
[time=2435] Romans 6, 7, and 8 are a package. They are a group of chapters that are representing a single thought.
[time=2443] And the thought is, tell me about the reign of grace. Explain it to me. You've spent the first three chapters describing the reign of sin and the reign of death.
[time=2452] But now, what about this thing called the reign of grace? What does it look like? How does it work?
[time=2458] Well, when you move through these chapters and in weeks to come, we'll give some attention to their content.
[time=2463] But if you'll come to the end of it with me, you'll find the crescendo of it all. Romans 8, verses 28, 29, and 30.
[time=2471] He builds in his argument this final great moment, declaring the power of God, declaring the reign of grace, declaring the wonderful reality that the grace of God not only pardons, but it perfects.
[time=2486] We know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
[time=2494] For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren.
[time=2502] And whom he predestined these he also called, and whom he called these he also justified, and whom he justified these he also glorified. There it is.
[time=2514] Well, I want to begin that all by way of introduction. I'd like to begin looking at this first part of the power of the grace of God, the reign of the grace of God, by looking at its purpose.
[time=2529] We'll look at its purpose, its promise, and its perfection, probably this morning only its purpose.
[time=2535] Specifically, where is this thing taking me? Tell me about this power. What is it going to make me look like? And you'll find it in verse 29.
[time=2543] He says, "For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to what? To become conformed to the image of his son, to become conformed to the image of his son."
[time=2559] The word conform means to have the same form as. You and I are eventually going to have the same form as Jesus has.
[time=2566] Now, we're not going to lose our identity. We're not going to become a bunch of little Jesus's running around. We look like Jesus. Nobody can tell us from the real Jesus.
[time=2574] So, we'll still be ourselves. But we will be conformed to his image, both outwardly and inwardly, both outwardly and inwardly.
[time=2585] Philippians, chapter 3, describes that there is a day coming when we will be transformed by this power of grace.
[time=2592] It says, "We'll transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory by the exertion of the power that has even to subject all things to himself."
[time=2605] You see, the body is not intrinsically evil. This thing we carry around that houses our spirit. It is not intrinsically evil as the Greek pagan thought.
[time=2614] Paul calls it in 1 Corinthians 6, 19, the very temple or the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2621] But nevertheless, it is subject to weakness and suffering and sickness and ugliness and futility and death.
[time=2630] This physical body of ours by virtue of the curse of the fall is not what it ought to be, and there is a day coming when it will be transformed.
[time=2638] Our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory.
[time=2645] There we will have a glory about us, like Moses and his face shining. We will have a shine to us because we will have been transformed.
[time=2656] But beyond that part, there is wrapped up in our physical body a susceptibility to sin, not just the weakness and the suffering and the fact we get tired.
[time=2667] But there is locked up in our flesh, propensity towards sin. That's what he struggles with in Romans 7.
[time=2674] He says, "For I know that nothing good dwells in me. That is in my flesh, for the wishing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not."
[time=2686] He says, "I see a different law in the members of my body. Somehow wrapped up, and I don't mean just flesh, but wrapped up in this humanness which includes my body.
[time=2697] There is something in me that wages war against the law of my mind, making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members."
[time=2708] And so he cries out, "Wretched man that I am, who shall set me free from the body of this death? Give me out of this thing. Glorify me. Give me my new body.
[time=2722] Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord so that on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other hand with my flesh the law of sin."
[time=2734] Jesus is going to transform us and give us a new body.
[time=2740] But that would be even in a sense our external conformity to Christ. There is an internal conformity to Christ which we are awaiting.
[time=2748] We will inwardly look like Jesus, inwardly, in all that is immaterial about us, the Spirit, the soul, the heart, the mind, the will, the emotions.
[time=2757] All of that too will begin to look like Jesus. It will affect the point of glorification. It will be just like Jesus.
[time=2765] The heart will be so totally devoted to God that the mind and the will and the emotions will only be in compliance constantly in every aspect of our lives with the will of God.
[time=2775] We will be able to say as Jesus did in John chapter 7, "I always do the things that are pleasing to him."
[time=2782] What a tremendous statement. Could you think of anything better to have on your tombstone? This man, this woman, always and only did the things that were pleasing to God.
[time=2795] That's where we're headed. We're headed to a place in spirit, soul and mind that we will always and only do the things that are pleasing to God.
[time=2809] So Christ's likeness. Paul knew that. When he went to minister with a group of people, what was his aim? What did he want to produce?
[time=2819] What was he after? What did he understand his mission to be? He says to the Galatians in verse 19 of chapter 4, "My children, my blessed children with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you."
[time=2838] And of course he had no power over the physical part. That will happen at our point of glorification.
[time=2843] But he did know that he could minister his spiritual gifts. He could make a difference in that person's life to cause them in the spiritual side to begin to act and think and talk and behave and look spiritually more like Jesus Christ.
[time=2858] In another book that he wrote to the Ephesians, he talks about that as the sign there of growth. He prays that we should all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a mature man to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=2877] Therein is sanctification, that we should look more like Jesus. It's an amazing thing. Over in Philippians 2, it says, "Have this attitude in yourself which was also in Jesus Christ." There's the same thought.
[time=2893] They begin to look like Jesus. Well, what's the attitude? Nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[time=2899] But with humility of mind, let each of you regard one another as more important than himself. Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourself, which was also in Christ Jesus.
[time=2914] So there is this great purpose. As we find ourselves flowing and floating and being compelled and propelled down the river of the reign of grace, we are moving to look like Jesus.
[time=2929] But it also says in Romans 8, there additionally is another purpose revealed there, and it's even greater than that. It's even greater than that we should look like Jesus. This is a better purpose, a greater purpose, a more awesome purpose. Romans 8, 29, for whom he foreknew, he also predestined, one to be conformed to the image of his Son. We just looked at that, but here's another reason that he, namely Jesus,
[time=2958] might be the first born among many brethren. And you're thinking, what's that mean? First born among many brethren.
[time=2965] Well, it goes back to the Jewish culture and talking about the first born. The first born male was an individual who found special privilege in his home. The inheritance for him would be larger than any other. The leadership would be his at his father's death. It was a position of preeminence. And so figuratively, this phrase also talks just generically about preeminence, the place of great preeminence.
[time=2987] What it's saying here is that God is moving us under the power of the reign of grace such that we should look like Jesus, but ultimately it's not just for us that he does that, it's so that in glory Christ will have preeminence.
[time=3003] Colossians 1 says that he is also head of the body, namely Jesus, the church, and he is the beginning, the first born from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything.
[time=3020] Let me say it this way. God is working to glorify you so that when you get to heaven, you can spend all of eternity glorifying Jesus as he ought to be glorified by you.
[time=3032] You and I can glorify God to some extent today in our lives. We honor the word of God, we love each other, we're humble of heart, and we lift our hands and praise and say, "God, you save me by grace, and I'm living for your power, and everything that I am, and everything that I hope to be is the product of you in my life, and I want to glorify you."
[time=3050] But you see, we're not glorified yet, and with that, out of the same mouth that offers praise, offers cursing, and our hearts are not undivided for God.
[time=3059] And there is division in our soul and spirit, and we are not perfect, and we are not all that we could be.
[time=3064] And so the marvelous reality is that this reign of grace is working and driving to produce us, to look like Jesus, to glorify us so that for eternity we can then respond and give the glory to Jesus that is his due, and that we will never be able to give him until we are glorified.
[time=3083] This whole thing is bigger than we are. This whole process of salvation is bigger than we are. There is a bigger agenda, and it is Jesus.
[time=3095] Isn't that great? I mean, I'm down here slugging it out of my Christian life, and I'm trying to find out how to live, and I'm trying to love my wife, and I'm trying to love my kids, and I'm trying to minister in this church, and you and your same way in your neighborhoods and your streets,
[time=3107] and it gets awful dusty in the ruckus of our sin, and the confusion of it all, but out of that we can know that God has us already placed on the river of His grace, and it's going to take us to the place that we are glorified.
[time=3122] But why? So that then we can glorify Jesus.
[time=3127] It's an amazing truth. We with the elders of Revelation 4 will fall down at His feet and cast our crowns. Our crowns of righteousness, 2 Timothy 4, our crowns of life, James 1, our crowns of glory, 1 Peter 5 at His feet.
[time=3142] And we'll sing the great song, "Worthy Art Thou O Lord our God, to receive glory."
[time=3149] And I want to glorify you. Everything you've given me, everything you've done in my life, both while I was on the planet at the moment of glorification when you finally came, and I saw you and I was like you for I saw you for who you were.
[time=3161] Now that I'm completely glorified, I want to give it all to you, Jesus. I want to glorify you forever.
[time=3168] Revelation 5, "Worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing."
[time=3184] The grace of God. There is first in our lives this reality of the pardoning power of the grace of God to forgive, to remove us from our sins.
[time=3197] It's awesome and it's endless. It never stops. You can come over and over and over and over and over again, not that you need ultimate forgiveness, but to get your fellowship back with God the way you like it.
[time=3208] That sense of open line of communication with God, it's endless, it never stops.
[time=3213] But so many times when we think about the grace of God, we think about it exclusively in those terms.
[time=3219] But what this book labors for us to see is that there is so much more to the power of the grace of God than just pardoned.
[time=3227] It's as if there was a criminal and the criminal has done something wrong and he's now going to be sentenced, maybe to death.
[time=3238] And a governor or a president says no, stop, pardon.
[time=3243] Well, that's right. That person doesn't have to suffer the consequences of his behavior. He's been pardoned. He's been forgiven.
[time=3250] But do you know that the human pardon, human grace has absolutely no power then to move beyond the original pardon to perfect that guy?
[time=3260] He's still a criminal. He's still who he is.
[time=3266] The governor and the president have absolutely no ability to move into his life and change him into something he isn't.
[time=3272] At best, there is just pardoned. But with God's grace, there is not only pardon and forgiveness for sins and no damnation,
[time=3279] but there is this reign of grace that moves into the life and has the power to change that life and move it to the place that it looks like Jesus.
[time=3292] So that ultimately we can give all of our glory, all that we are to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3304] You know, in trying to illustrate this, again and again, this is kind of doctrinal, you know, and it can get heavy and I'm laboring in my mind to think of ways to bring it to you so that when you walk out of here,
[time=3316] you understand that man, you know, God isn't working my life more than I'm at work in my life. God cares more about my sanctification, more about my growth than I do.
[time=3327] He does. It's true.
[time=3330] Sometimes we get into the habit of viewing him as he's out there and he's the standard.
[time=3335] And when we mess up, we don't like it. And so we need to work hard, you know, and ask for forgiveness and get back in his graces.
[time=3341] And I guess that's part of our Christian experience. But what this passage talks about is man, he's already put you in a place.
[time=3347] He's already set you on a river. He's already taken care of at all.
[time=3352] He is going to perfect you. He is going to make you look like Jesus and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[time=3361] That's your great and awesome God. And we should love him for it.
