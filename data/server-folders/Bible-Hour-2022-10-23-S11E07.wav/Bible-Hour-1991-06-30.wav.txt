[time=12] If a person comes to Christ, a person makes a profession of faith in Jesus Christ, and
[time=18] then continues to live a sinful lifestyle as if they'd never made that profession of faith.
[time=25] What happens to that person when they die?
[time=27] Do they go to heaven, or do they go to hell?
[time=31] Stay tuned, we'll talk about what God's word has to say about that.
[time=35] [MUSIC]
[time=47] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship.
[time=53] Thank you for joining us.
[time=55] Pastor Morris' message today is entitled, "Living the Life of Grace." Should a profession of faith in Jesus Christ result in a changed lifestyle?
[time=64] What happens if the individual continues to maintain a sinful lifestyle?
[time=68] Is he really saved?
[time=70] Will he go to heaven?
[time=71] In today's message, Pastor Russ will examine what the Bible has to say about this very important issue.
[time=78] Before the message, we will be ministered to by a solo from Lisa Reniker entitled, "The Price of Freedom."
[time=86] And a solo from Brian Loosen entitled, "His Grace is Greater."
[time=92] Let's join our worship service as the sanctuary choir with soloist Brian Loosen sings, "Hold the Flame of Freedom High."
[time=100] [MUSIC]
[time=130] Will one light make a difference in this world, and a lonely light, taste the night I wonder?
[time=147] And one voice crying out, "Be heard, will they ever hear my simple words?
[time=157] I wonder the doubts that we are feeling I have known, but I've learned through all the years.
[time=170] It is not my might, it is not my power, it is God alone.
[time=183] Just bring the name of Jesus, light a candle in the night, just bring the name of Jesus.
[time=200] Here's God's darkness with his light.
[time=212] Hold the flame of freedom high, to mass it on to one another give it burning bright.
[time=224] Hold the flame of freedom high, still all well can see, to shine up to me.
[time=238] Hold the flame of freedom high, here's God alone, without his heart.
[time=257] Change the sunlight, the light of the world.
[time=265] Hold the flame of freedom high, mass it on to one another give it burning bright.
[time=281] Hold the flame of freedom high, still all well can see, to shine up to me.
[time=295] Hold the flame of freedom high, hold the flame of freedom high, high.
[time=325] What a privilege it is to hold the light of salvation high before the world.
[time=330] Come Christians join to sing Oluia because of the grace of our Lord.
[time=334] We'll sing all three verses of him number 108 please, him number 108.
[time=350] All we deserve is joy to stream Oluia, Oluia, Oluia, Oluia, Oluia.
[time=368] Let all with heart and voice be for his strong rejoice.
[time=378] Praise his gracious souls, Oluia, Oluia, Oluia.
[time=389] Let all with heart, Oluia, Oluia, Oluia.
[time=396] Let all praises to the sky, Oluia, Oluia, Oluia.
[time=405] We are our infinite through the self-armism in such a way.
[time=418] Oluia, Oluia, Oluia.
[time=424] Praise him, Oluia.
[time=433] Praise him, Oluia, Oluia, Oluia.
[time=463] Thank you for your wonderful singing today.
[time=465] We appreciate that very much.
[time=467] We're going to continue with music now.
[time=469] When Nelson's going to come and sing about the grace of our Lord and Savior, Pastor Russell will be speaking on that again today.
[time=476] Let's listen as Brian sings for us.
[time=482] [MUSIC]
[time=495] His grace is greater than our failures.
[time=506] His peace runs deeper than our fears.
[time=515] If we go to Him for mercy, our hearts can rest assured.
[time=526] His love will keep us through our tears.
[time=536] He'll give us strength to simply trust Him.
[time=545] Through times we may not understand.
[time=554] And in a sweet assurance, no passing doubt can deal.
[time=563] Our lives are safely in His hands.
[time=573] No countless souls have come to Him, so desperate and lost.
[time=583] With faith no greater than a tiny seed.
[time=593] Each one has found no wondrous truth.
[time=598] We make His simple cross, His grace is greater than our need.
[time=613] No height or depth in all creation can reach beyond His love
[time=627] for me.
[time=632] And His power has raised my spirit.
[time=637] Our work forever done with grace.
[time=647] His power has raised my spirit, our work forever done.
[time=660] His grace is greater.
[time=669] His grace is greater than my need.
[time=687] [APPLAUSE]
[time=691] Hello and thank you for joining us for another week of the Bible Hour.
[time=695] I want to say good morning to my good friend Pastor Ross.
[time=699] This has been a great weekend for you.
[time=702] Your parents just came in from California, is that right?
[time=705] That's right.
[time=706] They heard about the patriotic panorama and I think they're so excited to see that.
[time=709] They may even be using that as an excuse to come out here and see their grandkids.
[time=714] That's great.
[time=715] This is the time that we're heavily involved in the patriotic panorama.
[time=718] Of course we can't invite the people to come because of this viewing day it will be over.
[time=723] But it's an exciting day for us.
[time=726] Here in a series of messages on grace and we've had a good time from week to week.
[time=731] You're continuing this Sunday morning on that subject.
[time=733] Tell us a little bit about your message.
[time=735] Well this Sunday we head into an area of our Christian theology that is absolutely essential that we understand.
[time=743] And the question we're going to be trying to answer, really ask and answer, is can a person come to Christ and then abide or remain in sin, live in sin, Romans 6-1.
[time=756] It's anti-anominational lawlessness and it's been asked so many times throughout the history of the church.
[time=761] But it's being asked very loudly even today in our day and age.
[time=765] Paul has some very direct and strong things to say about it.
[time=768] But it's also a message about our assurance.
[time=771] How can we know we're truly saved?
[time=773] And so I hope that as we move towards the message even today the people watching will have an opportunity
[time=780] to really examine their own lives and take a test if you will to see if they're truly in the faith.
[time=786] And so hopefully it'll be a time of tremendous encouragement.
[time=789] It may however be a very revealing time.
[time=791] They may find that that boy as you give that test I don't know that I'm saved.
[time=796] I don't know that I'm truly a child of God even though I may have prayed a prayer at some point or come forward in an aisle or something like that.
[time=803] And for those folks if that concern is aroused in their heart we want them to write us or call us
[time=809] or talk to us because we don't want them to be left out alone if you will.
[time=814] Well that sounds like an extremely important topic for our own people right here in the congregation as well as those that are listening on the Bible hour.
[time=822] I want to say too that we have special programs during the week on Wednesday evenings.
[time=827] There's a great one coming up on July 10th.
[time=830] We're going to have the Continental Orchestra and Singers.
[time=833] It's about 45 young people that travel across the country some marvelous music that evening.
[time=838] You'll enjoy it.
[time=839] I hope that you'll set that date on your calendar July 10th.
[time=843] 7 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=846] We'd love to have you come and join with us for a great evening of music with the Continental Orchestra and Singers.
[time=853] And then Russ mentioned to you that we appreciate the fact that you write into us and tell us of your prayer requests and your needs and even as you listen to the message today you've got some questions.
[time=865] I hope that you'll write to us at the Bible hour.
[time=867] And also you can ask for the booklet that we've been offering this month called God's Promises.
[time=873] This is the last Sunday we're going to offer it but we'd like to offer it to you today and it's absolutely free.
[time=878] So write to us today at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=889] Once again that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=898] We're going to go back to the regularly scheduled program right now and listen to some more music from Brian Loosen and then this very important message.
[time=906] You need to stay tuned, listen to the message, and then write us with your concerns or questions.
[time=911] We'd love to hear from you this week. Thank you for joining us today.
[time=936] [MUSIC]
[time=961] I've heard it said that good things don't come easy.
[time=968] That anything of value has a price.
[time=975] I need to know that there can be a reason for the pain and those who gave their lives for us have not died in vain.
[time=990] It's hard to understand the price of freedom.
[time=999] It's hard to comprehend the cost of love.
[time=1007] Why does someone always have to pay so high a price and those at home with empty arms mourn the sacrifice?
[time=1024] Lord, I know there is a price for freedom. Someone offers love his life so we can live.
[time=1038] Lord, I know there is a price for freedom. No grain nor has anyone to give.
[time=1053] That they die for which earth the price they paid. I will honor, I will live for, I will stand and say, Lord, I know there is a price for freedom.
[time=1081] Lord, the words of battle feel, there will never be the highest price.
[time=1094] The grace that the price was paid on the power of peace.
[time=1104] Lord, I thank the price of freedom.
[time=1109] You offered up your life so we can live. Lord, you paid the price for freedom. No grain of love has anyone to give.
[time=1128] That you died for with the worth the price you paid. I will honor, I will live for, I will stand and say, Lord, you paid the price for my freedom.
[time=1149] You offered up your life so we can live. Lord, you paid the price for freedom. No grain of love has anyone to give.
[time=1168] Lord, the freedom that you died for was the worth the price you paid. I will honor, I will live for, I will stand and say, Lord, you know there is a price for freedom.
[time=1197] Jesus, the price for freedom.
[time=1225] Let's pray together, our gracious God and Heavenly Father, we are so thankful that Jesus was willing to pay the price for our freedom to free us from the marketplace of sin, to redeem us unto life that we might live for you and glorify your name.
[time=1240] We thank you, we honor you, and we praise you for that. In your name, Jesus, amen.
[time=1246] You take your Bibles this morning and open them to Romans 5 as we continue our study on the grace of God. What a blessed morning it's been already and now the privilege of opening the Word and learning from the Apostle Paul about the grace of God.
[time=1263] Romans 5 verses 20 and 21, if you will, and the law came in that the transgression might increase, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more. Stop right there.
[time=1278] What Paul is saying is that the law, the Old Testament was given so that people when they had to compare their lives to the objective truth of God in the law of God would find just how sinful they truly are.
[time=1291] The law was never given to save anybody. The law was always and only given to point out the sinfulness of man and thereby bring to the surface his desperate need for the grace of God which is then capable to overpower the sin, to super abound.
[time=1306] You can't out-sin the grace of God where sin increased, grace super abounded all the more. I love it when my daughters go through the stage and they want to come home from school or maybe they've been playing in the neighborhood and they've got this new thing and they come up and say, now Dad, now squeeze my hand and I'll squeeze your hand and we'll see who squeezes the hardest.
[time=1326] And, you know, I'm just loving this, right? So they take a hold of it and they begin to just -- and I say, why do you use two hands, honey?
[time=1334] And they can't do it. And then I begin to squeeze. And my incredible power and strength begins to crush that little grip until it lays length in my hand.
[time=1345] And I just -- I overpower their limited strength and that's the comparison. You can sin all you want. You can muster up all the filth in your life you could possibly imagine and it's nothing in the hand of God.
[time=1361] The grace of God super abounds. He's too big, he's too strong in his power. Think of men like Hitler who piled up one sin on top of another, just began to stockpile them until he'd murdered 6 million Jews.
[time=1377] And the amazing thing about the abounding grace of God is that if Hitler would have paused even the moment before his death and reached up in true faith and accepted Jesus Christ as his own life.
[time=1390] Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior, God would have been pleased for his grace to super abound over all that sin and grant forgiveness.
[time=1403] You can't out-sin God. Stalin couldn't out-sin God with a 30 million Russians that he murdered. God knew every single one of those people.
[time=1412] All 30 million he knew by name. He loved them. He created them in his image. They were his property and Stalin murdered them. 30 million of them.
[time=1422] You can't heap it up high enough because if Stalin would have paused, like the thief on the cross and said, "I believe in true saving faith that thou art the Son of God.
[time=1436] When I seek your mercy and desire to receive your forgiveness, God would have delighted for his super abounding grace to cover it all."
[time=1447] Even a wicked, insane man like the Night Stalker, you probably heard of him. Well, we lived in fear of him in California.
[time=1453] This insane man who roamed the streets looking for open windows at night where he would secretly come into a home and then rape and murder everybody in there.
[time=1463] You know, God's grace super abounds. But it raises a question. If, in fact, and it's true, if the grace of God super abounds bigger than anybody's stockpile of sin, if you will, there is then this question.
[time=1481] And look at it in verse 1, chapter 6. What shall we say? In other words, if that's true about the grace of God, what shall we say?
[time=1489] And here's the question. Are we to continue in sin that grace might increase? Are we to continue in sin that grace might increase?
[time=1498] In other words, if you can't out-sin God, if no matter how bad you get, you're not bad enough and God can still overpower and overcome with his super abounding grace and forgive you for all your sins, the question is raised.
[time=1508] Well, wait a minute then. Does that mean that we should continue just to live in sin so that the glory of God's grace can be displayed?
[time=1516] The word "continue" there is the word "epomeno" in the Greek and it means to stay or to abide, to make a residence, to set up a home as if you were moving to Fort Wayne and you brought all your furniture with you and you discontinued all your own phone lines and all your own credit cards.
[time=1531] And you even took a test and became a legitimate driver here in the state of Indiana. Why? Because you're abiding here. You plan to stay here a long time.
[time=1540] Shall we as Christians, because of the overpowering grace of God, remain, continue, abide, stay in sin as a characteristic pattern of life?
[time=1553] If salvation is all of grace and the law only came that the transgression might increase so that the glory of God's grace could be shown and shed abroad, shed we then live in that sin?
[time=1565] Why not sin all the time? It's called antinomianism or lawlessness. And it's a doctrine that has been taught in response to this, the marvelous message of grace, since it was preached its first time. That's why Paul raises the question.
[time=1578] He knows from personal experience in other adventures preaching the gospel and the wonder and the power of God's grace to pardon, no matter how bad the sin, somebody stands up as if a lawyer in a courtroom and says objection.
[time=1589] Wait a minute, if salvation is all of grace and the grace of God abounds as it does, then you're going to have a whole bunch of Christians just living in lawlessness because they know they can't out-sin God.
[time=1602] It's very attractive, isn't it? There have been times we've been tempted to say, "Well, I shouldn't do that, I know, but I know the grace of God forgives me, so I'll do it anyway."
[time=1612] That was invited not too long ago to play at a famous country club that was a Jack Nicholas signature course, you know, which means he designed it and had been there many times and had overseen the project and all.
[time=1624] And it was a wonderful privilege, but I didn't have a locker. And so as I came in, they gave me a locker and guess whose name was on my locker?
[time=1631] Jack, Nicholas.
[time=1634] And I'm thinking, "Wait a minute, is this really his locker or is this just like a promotional thing?" And so I have very reverently, if you will, held onto the door of this locker and opened it up and sure enough inside the locker were a pair of his golf shoes.
[time=1649] Jack, Nicholas, golf shoes, do you understand what that means? Do you have any idea? Do you have any idea? I've watched the man play enough golf, I knew that those were his shoes because of the shape of his feet.
[time=1660] And just to verify it, I picked the shoes up and looked inside and sure enough, his name was in there, not monogrammed into the leather, but there on a piece of paper and then taped there so when they would be, you know, polished by the people at the club, they'd get back to the room.
[time=1672] These were his shoes, and I said to the guy next to me, I said, "I'm stealing these." This is it. I have got it. I am stealing. I'm sticking these in my bag and I know that God will forgive me because the grace of God abounds.
[time=1685] This is my chance. I'm cashing in on the grace of God today. It's very tempting, isn't it?
[time=1693] Well, the marvelous reality is that when we struggle with sin and we do struggle with sin, the grace of God super abounds, but that's not the question here.
[time=1702] The question that Paul is answering is this.
[time=1706] Does the Bible teach that a person can come to Christ and then live the rest of their life in lawlessness, in sin, continue in that, make a home there in the domain of sin?
[time=1721] That's the question. And he goes on to answer it in verses 2 to 14, and next week we're going to look at his detailed answer, but this week, because I believe it's so vital to address the issue, I want to look at the New Testament in general and answer that question.
[time=1736] Does the Bible establish a category of believer who is truly saved, has truly come to Christ, but then continues to live on in sin as if they never come to Christ?
[time=1748] That's the question. Look at the beginning of his answer. Verse 2, "May it never be." That's an idiom in the Greek.
[time=1758] It's "May genatoy," which is just the strongest possible "no" he can come up with.
[time=1764] It's as if he's saying, "Parish the thought." Absolutely not. No way. It's inconceivable. It's disgusting.
[time=1773] It's repulsive. The very thought that a true believer could remain and abide and live and stay in the domain of sin.
[time=1784] He warned of it at another place, and if you'd come with me there, 1 Corinthians chapter 6.
[time=1790] 1 Corinthians chapter 6. Now, you remember the church at Corinth? They were this marvelously gifted church. They had more spiritual gifts than they knew what to do with, but they also had more sin than they knew what to do with.
[time=1801] There was a church that was marked by division and strife. There was incest, homosexuality, fornication, all in this big assembly called believers.
[time=1811] And Paul is so committed to the truth and to the gospel and to the souls of those people that he says some very hard things to them.
[time=1819] Look at it. 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9.
[time=1841] These people had been involved in that stuff. Look at verse 11. Such were some of you. See, he's not saying that if you've ever been a homosexual or if you're ever committed adultery or if you've ever committed fornication or if you've ever been a thief or if you've ever stolen something or ever been drunk,
[time=1865] he's not saying that if you've done those things you can never come to Christ. That's why Christ came. Christ came to save all those people.
[time=1873] But in verse 11 he says, "Such were some of you, but you were washed and you were sanctified and you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God."
[time=1884] The point is you were that. But now because of Calvary you've been washed and cleansed and the word sanctified means this progressive pattern of holiness building in your life like a snowball that starts small and the further down the hill it gets, it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger because of the grace of God in your life.
[time=1902] You move further and further and further and further away of the homosexuality and the effeminate and the adultery and the fornication your life begins to take on momentum for the cause of Christ and you look more and more like Jesus every day. Not the opposite. That's why he says back in verse 9, "Do not be deceived."
[time=1922] It's just as obvious as black and white. People who have truly come to Christ by faith, the grace of God, it's not works, but people who have actually and truly come to Christ live differently.
[time=1939] Live differently. Well maybe you're thinking this. Why are we asking this question? Salvation is a very personal matter.
[time=1948] It goes on between a person and their God. And if a person has prayed to receive Jesus Christ as their Savior, what business is it of ours to even suggest evaluating whether that confession of faith was a true confession of faith?
[time=1963] Whether that person is truly saved, why isn't that between that person and God and doesn't it make us judgmental if we even ask the question? Well, turn over to 2 Corinthians chapter 13.
[time=1981] Verse 5. And look at what Paul says. Paul loves these people. Paul does not want these people spending eternity in hell. And out of that love he says 2 Corinthians 13 verse 5, test yourself.
[time=1998] How? To see if you are in the faith. Make sure that your profession of faith, that subjective thing that goes on between a man and his God, make sure that what happened there really brought you into the faith.
[time=2015] Again verse 5. Examine yourselves. Do you not recognize this about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you unless indeed you fail the test? Boy, you can hear his heart, can't you?
[time=2028] He's been traveling all over the world. He's been in shipwrecks. He's been beaten. He's been thrown in prison. At one point in his life Romans 10 I think Paul even said I wished myself a curse. He didn't mean dead.
[time=2039] He meant I wish that I could be sent to hell forever if it would mean that the nation of Israel would open their eyes and open their ears and soften their hearts and come to Christ.
[time=2050] He loved these people and he knew that many of them in the Corinthian church had made a profession of faith that was merely an intellectual assent to the facts of the gospel and they weren't truly saved because they were living in this continue of sin, this residence of sin.
[time=2067] He doesn't want them to die and enter into a Christless eternity thinking their saved and so he says please test yourself to see if you're really saved, to see if you're really in the faith.
[time=2079] Can you recognize this about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you? That's the hallmark of Christianity. Christ in you the hope of glory.
[time=2087] When we truly become saved Jesus takes residence and our heart and he says look inside is Jesus there. You know there was an entire book in the New Testament written for this very purpose so that this test could actually be taken and I'd like us to go there.
[time=2103] First John chapter 5 this whole book is one long test to see if you're truly saved.
[time=2115] First John chapter 5 explains why he wrote the book verse 13.
[time=2122] Got you using your Bibles again praise God those pages are flipping. First John chapter 5 verse 13 look at it.
[time=2133] These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God in order that you may know that you have eternal life.
[time=2142] Remember when you were in math and you had a big set and then they had a subset inside the big set?
[time=2149] That's what he's talking about here. There's a big set of people called those who believe in the name of the Son of God.
[time=2156] But I'm writing this book to you because I want you to make sure that you're in the smaller subset of those who actually have eternal life.
[time=2165] In other words in this big group who profess belief in Jesus Christ some have eternal life and some don't and this book is written so that by reading it and applying it to your life you can take the test if you will
[time=2177] and have some basis of assurance that I'm actually in the group that has eternal life and I'm not stuck over here in the group that's made a profession of faith and thinks I'm saved but I'm not.
[time=2188] See the Apostle John wrote this book as he did five other books in the New Testament the Gospel of John, first, second, third John and then revelation.
[time=2197] And what you have here in 1 John is a continuation of a theme that he'd hinted at in the Gospel of John.
[time=2203] We don't have to turn there but if you were to look in John chapter 2 you'd find Jesus is preaching to a great crowd and this crowd is seeing his miraculous works.
[time=2211] They're seeing him heal and create food and do all the things he did and the Bible says that that group of people numbers of it came to believe in Jesus.
[time=2219] But Jesus goes on to say did not entrust himself to them because he knew what was in men.
[time=2226] Jesus knew that there was a level of belief a level of intellectual consent to the person of Jesus even seeing his miracles that didn't constitute saving faith and so he didn't entrust himself to those people.
[time=2238] The theme is further developed in John chapter 8 when he's before another group of people and he's preaching and it says and many came to believe in him and you go man this is great everybody's getting saved.
[time=2249] And then Jesus begins to talk to them about abiding in the Word of God and obeying the Word of God and putting their true faith in Jesus to enable them to do that and they admit they don't want to do that they don't need that stuff.
[time=2261] And by it's John 830 when it says they believed in him and by John 844 Jesus looks at him and says let me help you out.
[time=2271] You are of your father the devil.
[time=2274] Your father is not God the father.
[time=2277] Your father is of the devil.
[time=2279] The Bible clearly teaches that there is a belief an intellectual belief a mental assent to the things of God that is not saving faith.
[time=2288] And so first John to those of you who believe in the name of the son of God you're in the room you're here you're in this group some of you actually have eternal life some of you don't as he writes to this group.
[time=2303] And he offers five questions in this book that help a person honestly look and say hey which group am I in.
[time=2313] If you're ready I'd love to give you the test.
[time=2316] Sounds like a great idea huh take a test nobody loves tests.
[time=2320] But this test may be helpful.
[time=2322] This test may be the most important one we've ever taken.
[time=2326] And I hope that this test will either confirm in your heart that you're truly saved and you walk out of here rejoicing in your heart you say man I heard those five questions and as I look at my life I'm there.
[time=2335] There's evidence in my life that I'm truly saved and I you're not in that camp I hope you walk out of this door saying man I'm not saved and I need to get saved.
[time=2345] Let's take the test question number one.
[time=2347] Question number one is found in the third chapter verses nine and ten would you turn there.
[time=2352] First John chapter three verses nine and ten.
[time=2362] I just know what he says no one who is born of God practices sin because his seed abides in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[time=2376] Keep reading verse ten by this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious.
[time=2383] Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God nor the one who does not love his brother.
[time=2390] Now you see the word practice in those two verses several times and if you read the whole book you'd find the word practice a lot of times in that book.
[time=2396] The word practice is a participle and it's describing the characteristic pattern of a person's life the characteristic pattern of a person's life.
[time=2404] It's not talking about occasional bouts with sin and we have our besetting sins and we know what they are and we hate them and we're trying to get rid of them and we're trying to live in victory.
[time=2413] That's not what he's talking about he's talking about a person who is living a habitual pattern of sin in their life it's the characteristic mark of their life.
[time=2422] My neighbor for example is a characteristic practicing physical fitness guy and it's great if he does a great job with his family and he works hard at work but when he's not doing one of those two things I know exactly where he is.
[time=2433] He's on his bike or he's running or he's swimming he's training for a triathlon and one look at his body and you know he practices that stuff.
[time=2440] It is the characteristic pattern of his life and when I ride with him on his you know I ride my bike and he rides his he rides slowly because I don't practice that stuff.
[time=2450] It's not a mark of my life when we run together he slows down about half and we go half the distance because he practices and I don't.
[time=2460] There's a marked difference in our lives he practices physical fitness I don't that's all this means.
[time=2468] When you look at your life in honesty and integrity are you in the practice of sin is that the habitual pattern or characteristic mark of your life.
[time=2481] That's question number one true or false true or false question number two you think wait a minute now this isn't fair I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and I can remember when I did it.
[time=2498] In fact it was 1983 it was in July and I remember some people came to my home and were sitting in my living room and we sat there and they talked to me about the gospel and I remember I prayed to receive Jesus and they even wrote in this Bible.
[time=2510] They gave me they put the date of my salvation down and they they quoted a verse about no one being able to pluck me out of the hand of God and they told me never to question my salvation that it was done it was finished it was over I'd now been saying.
[time=2525] I know I'm saved I don't want to talk about the way I live I know I'm saved because I remember the time when I professed Christ.
[time=2532] Well I wonder if that's biblical turn to 1 John chapter 1 is that the right basis of assurance of salvation 1 John 1 6 it says there if we say that we have fellowship with him what is that that's a profession of faith.
[time=2555] If you with your mouth say I have fellowship with God fellowship with God is another term for salvation it's just another term that shows see I'm in fellow I'm no longer Romans chapter five I'm no longer at enmity with God I'm not a sinner in that sense anymore.
[time=2568] I have fellowship with God but then look at the rest of the verse.
[time=2572] You say you have fellowship with him but you walk in darkness what you lie then do not practice the truth verse 7 but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin.
[time=2591] Nowhere in the New Testament are we ever instructed to base the assurance of our salvation the proof of our salvation on the fact that we can remember a time when we either got unbended knee or sat in a living room or came forward in a church and asked Jesus to come into our hearts.
[time=2610] That is nowhere presented in scripture as a basis of assurance instead it's that we should be walking in the light as he himself is in the light that's the evidence that we have fellowship with God it's that we're walking in the light.
[time=2624] So somebody comes up to you and says are you saved and you say yes and they say why you might start with the initial part of your testimony and say well I remember in substance that you date somebody told me the gospel and I was deeply pierced in my heart and I felt filthy and dirty before God
[time=2639] cried out for mercy and I believe that God came into my heart and let me tell you something else ever since that day my life's been different.
[time=2646] God's in charge of my life and sure I may have struggled along the way but like a snowball falling down a hill it's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger in my life and I look more like Jesus every minute and maybe not enough for your liking but I'm moving along.
[time=2658] I'm looking more like Jesus righteousness is the pattern of my life.
[time=2663] That's the basis of assurance not a profession of faith. Can I talk you into going to one more scripture before we go back to John Matthew chapter seven.
[time=2673] Matthew chapter seven here it comes even from the lips of our precious Lord Jesus Christ Jesus is here on the sermon on the mount.
[time=2681] He has a whole host of people before him he has his disciples there he has the false religious leaders of the day and he has a multitude of people who have been following because of his miraculous signs.
[time=2692] The thesis or the point of his whole message is that your righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees or you'll never see the kingdom of God.
[time=2701] His entire message is about evidences of really entering the kingdom of God true salvation and so he comes to the finale of his message he comes right down to the to the end the big conclusion of it in Matthew chapter seven verse twenty one and look at what he says.
[time=2718] Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2723] Now how could you have a better profession of faith than that?
[time=2728] That's his title Lord Lord.
[time=2732] He says not everybody who makes that profession of faith enters the kingdom of heaven go back verse twenty one but he who what he who does the will of my father who is in heaven.
[time=2745] Many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles.
[time=2754] We even have a list of religious credentials we've even done some things we we join the church we have a Bible we've we've even shared the faith we've done all kinds of things Lord Lord.
[time=2764] But listen to what disqualifies them look look at what Jesus uses as the true litmus test of their salvation not their profession and not even some religious deeds verse twenty three.
[time=2775] Then I will declare to them I never knew you depart from me you who practiced lawlessness you who have as the characteristic pattern of your life sin you who have it as a domain.
[time=2789] You can hear his heart breaking for these people who are deceived and they think that they're saved because of profession of faith and some religious deeds but there's no evidence of true saving faith in their life because they live in sin.
[time=2802] Now you know why Paul would scream out may it never be that we should continue to live in sin it's not true and if you believe it true and you live like it's true then you're going to come to the final day of judgment and Jesus is going to look at you and say who are you?
[time=2818] And you say wait a minute 1983 my living room remember then I joined the church then I did some religious activity.
[time=2829] He's gonna say wait wait I don't know you you have practiced lawlessness it's obvious that what you thought you did there was only an intellectual ascent of the things of God and this religious behavior was just an external thing that never really
[time=2847] flowed from the depths of your heart as praise and worship to me you've been deceived you've been deceived.
[time=2855] It's terrifying that's why the book of 1 John that's why God is so faithful to give us a clear written objective test if you will to look into our hearts.
[time=2866] Let's go back now to question number three question number one is do you practice sin true or false.
[time=2874] Question number two is do you base your assurance of salvation on a profession of faith somewhere in your past true or false.
[time=2882] Question number three are your affections set on the things of the world 1 John 2.
[time=2891] Look at it first John 2 verse 15.
[time=2896] First John 2 15 do not love the world nor the things in the world.
[time=2903] Here it is if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him.
[time=2908] You know it says in the book of Romans that when you truly become a believer the love of God is shed abroad in your heart.
[time=2914] That's a hallmark of Christianity the love of God is shed abroad supernaturally by the spirit of God at the moment of true salvation and what he is saying here is if you love the world if the love of the father isn't in you you're not saved.
[time=2930] Keep reading verses 16 and 17 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the father.
[time=2939] It's from the world and the world is passing away and also it's lusts but the one who does the will of God abides forever.
[time=2947] Same theme all over again.
[time=2951] What he's asking is if your love and affection for the things of the world is so overpowering and so strong that you're drawn to it and you can't resist it and it's the mark of your life and you almost feel constrained and him then in a negative way by this Christian community
[time=2964] and you wish you could go away to a city where nobody knows you and wish you could change your name and live your own life and be free from all the trappings of this Christianity and let the love in your heart for the things of the world the lust of the eyes
[time=2976] and the lust of the flesh and the boastful pride of life find full expression in your life.
[time=2982] Question whether you're saved.
[time=2989] On the other hand if it's the love of God love for the word of God love for the people of God love for the things of God that is the characteristic pattern of your life and sure you struggle with lust of the flesh and lust of the eyes and there are weak moments in your life and you're susceptible to temptation as anybody but you hate it and you don't want it
[time=3006] and you wish you could get it out of your life and if there was a rip cord so to speak you could pull and get it all out at once you'd be the first guy grabbing it.
[time=3012] I hate this sin in me. See that's the mark of a believer.
[time=3018] The mark of an unbeliever is one who feels constrained by the Christian environment and wishes it wasn't here and wishes it could find a way out and live a different life because the love of the world is so powerful so compelling so constraining.
[time=3032] Question number four. Do you love the brethren? Chapter four verses seven and eight.
[time=3042] Again he puts us to the test.
[time=3047] Beloved let us love one another for love is from God and everyone who loves is what?
[time=3054] Love is born of God and knows God. Verse eight. The one who does not love does not know God for God is love.
[time=3066] Boy that's powerful. It's just as clear as night and day.
[time=3071] If a person is not in love with the brethren and not just an emotion or a spiritual goose bump about somebody in our church I'm talking about the body of believers that are represented in your community.
[time=3082] If there isn't a deep abiding love in your heart for those people to the place that you're willing to make sacrifices on their behalf and minister your spiritual gifts and support your money and give and do all the things and take your leisure time and help.
[time=3094] There's just something in you that is moving towards the brethren that sparks a keen interest there.
[time=3099] It's overwhelming when you go to another country and you see people who look different and dress different and eat different and smell different and think different but they're believers.
[time=3107] And there's just this ignition of love that kind of sparks between the two of you because you have a light precious faith.
[time=3115] If you're void of that, if there is no such love in your heart for the brethren that supersedes love of family and love of friends and love of neighbors and love of fellow cronies.
[time=3127] If there isn't this super abounding love for the brethren in your heart question, question whether or not you're truly safe, if there is such a love rejoice.
[time=3138] It's an evidence of true salvation.
[time=3143] Question number five.
[time=3145] Last question.
[time=3148] Are you born again?
[time=3151] Are you born again? Go to chapter five, if you will, and look at verses four and five.
[time=3158] Are you born again? Look at it, verse four.
[time=3162] For whatever is born of God overcomes the world.
[time=3167] And this is the victory that has come, that has overcome the world, our faith.
[time=3172] And who is the one who overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
[time=3178] We're back to the beginning, we're back to where we belong. True salvation is the product of faith and nothing else.
[time=3184] This is not a works religion. We can't earn salvation and after we've been given the gift of salvation, we don't have to work to keep it.
[time=3191] Those are both heresies.
[time=3194] What he is saying is if you claim to have faith in Jesus, do you look inside and see that you're different?
[time=3201] In the innermost part of your being is there a newness there of having been born again and you're now different because of the regenerating work of the Spirit of God?
[time=3210] Or when you look inside is it the same old you?
[time=3215] I'm not saying the same old tendencies are there but I mean at the core of who you are, your identity, are you still that sinful depraved wretched you?
[time=3226] Or since the day of your salvation has there been a new you, a new part of you that longs for the things of God and seeks for the things of God and recognizes I've been created new and fresh?
[time=3239] If you look inside and you don't find that question, question your salvation.
[time=3248] So again now we're ready to look at 13 again, 5-13. These things is why I sat down and wrote you this book.
[time=3255] I wrote you this book because as I showed you in the Gospel of John there's a way to believe that is damning.
[time=3261] There's a way to believe that sends people to hell. It's only an intellectual assent to the things of God but it's not a true apprehending of the person of Jesus Christ whereby you are actually saved and you should know that you have eternal life.
[time=3274] And so to that big group of you who have confessed faith in Jesus I write this letter and if you'll take the test you'll be able to divide, am I in the group that just thinks they have eternal life and doesn't?
[time=3285] Or am I in the group over here that is truly born again and truly saved?
[time=3291] Question number 1, do you practice sin? Is that the characteristic pattern of your life?
[time=3297] True or false? Do you base the assurance of your salvation on a profession of faith that you made at some time or even that you're willing to make today?
[time=3307] But your life is characteristic of lawlessness? Question your salvation.
[time=3313] Are the affections in your heart set for the things of the world? Is that really who you are? Is that really what you want?
[time=3321] Question your salvation. Do you have a deep abiding love of the brethren? Are you born again?
[time=3331] You know this is an emotionally charged issue isn't it?
[time=3335] We all have relatives, friends who have made a profession of faith, some of which have gone on to live absolutely unadulteratedly sinful lives, never changed, never turned and then they died on us and we wanted to believe with all our hearts somehow they were saved.
[time=3350] Some of us have relatives even living today that are that way.
[time=3355] It's emotionally charged, we want to somehow remove the reality of what this book says to us.
[time=3361] And it's this, that when you really come to Christ, when you really put your faith in Jesus Christ, something happens.
[time=3367] It's called being born again and out of that newness comes a different lifestyle.
[time=3372] And it's not characteristic of lawlessness, it's characteristic of righteousness.
[time=3377] And though along the path of life there are periods of tremendous depression or severe doubt or even overt sin.
[time=3385] It's not a sinlessness, it's just not characteristic of sin.
[time=3389] There are serious bouts along the way and people come into your life and pick you up and bring you back and you're on fire and you know, yeah okay, it's me, it's true.
[time=3397] I don't want that sin, I want to live for Jesus. Those are the evidences of true saving faith.
[time=3403] But it's when a person can claim Jesus and then begin to live a sinful life and faithful folks like you and me show up and call them to repentance and say you can't live like this, you're born again, you're new in Jesus.
[time=3414] This isn't true doubt, what you're talking about.
[time=3418] We've been sharing with you music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Lisa Reniker and Brian Lowson.

[time=3429] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3438] Our dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins.
[time=3445] And today as we listen to the message I know that I can have Jesus Christ as my savior.
[time=3450] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today, come into my heart. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3460] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
