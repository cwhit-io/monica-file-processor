[time=0] His name was Joe Feinstein. He stands out in my mind as one of the greatest examples of the power of the gospel to completely transform a life. Before he'd come to Christ, he was a hippie. In fact, he got into motorcycles and he become the president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Hells Angels. Once he met Jesus Christ, everything in his life changed. He eventually became the chairman of the board of elders of one of my previous churches, a tremendous example of a transformed life by the power of Jesus Christ. Stay with us this morning.
[time=35] We're gonna look at Romans chapter 6 and find out the dynamics of a transformed life.
[time=54] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship. Thank
[time=60] you for joining us. Pastor Moore's message today is entitled Possessing the Nature of Grace. Before the message we will be ministered to by a solo from Chad
[time=71] Veneta entitled The Man with the Nail Scars in His Hands. And a solo from
[time=78] Corinne sycophus, The Red, White, and Blue. Let's join our worship service as the
[time=86] sanctuary choir sings a song entitled An American Anthem.
[time=108] (Music)
[time=138] And the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars in the perilous
[time=147] night, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming. And the rocket's
[time=158] rocket's red glare, The bombs bursting in air, O'er the land of the free and the home of
[time=186] the brave.
[time=192] O'er the home of the home of the brave and the home of the brave.
[time=200] O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave, O'er the land of the free and the
[time=217] home of the brave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[time=232] O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[time=248] O'er the land of the brave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[time=272] O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave, O'er the land of the free and the
[time=296] home of the brave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[time=326] O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave, O'er the land of the free and the
[time=341] free and the home of the brave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[time=371] At a great week of celebrating the independence of our nation and also thanking God for the
[time=392] safe return of thousands of our soldiers from the desert storm conflict, I'm excited
[time=398] that we have that opportunity to thank the Lord for the fact that we live in America and that He indeed is guiding us as we seek His guidance.
[time=407] Guide me, O thou great Jehovah, Him number 51, please, we'll sing all three verses, Him number 51.
[time=427] O ye, O thou great, O thou great, O thou great, O thou great, O thou great, O thou great,
[time=539] When we were singing the choruses, the second chorus said, "He is Lord, He is Lord, He is risen from the dead, and He is Lord." We are thankful for that. We bow before Him today as our Lord and Savior. I'm going to continue with that theme as we listen to Chad Veneta sing, listen to his message and song right now.
[time=578] There are rows that don't go anywhere and one that leads you home. His strength he freely gives
[time=592] is to path to the one I seek, and I must go on. Shannu nah, shannu nah, shannu nah. His love
[time=608] is everlasting, and his mercy never fails. Shannu nah, shannu nah, shannu nah. I'll follow in the path of man.
[time=621] Nails cars in his hands. Nails cars in his hands. There are times I fear I
[time=638] can't go on. His strength is running out. There are times I feel I walk alone in shadows of my
[time=652] doubt, and there upon my knees his strength he freely gives to me. I stand by his power.
[time=667] Shannu nah, shannu nah, shannu nah. His love is everlasting, and his mercy never fails. Shannu nah, shannu nah,
[time=680] shannu nah. I'll follow in the path of man. Nails cars in his hands. Nails cars in his hands.
[time=697] Shannu nah, shannu nah, shannu nah, shannu nah.
[time=719] Oh, the road is rough and steep. He's the one to the place I see. Follow me, follow me home. Shannu nah, shannu nah,
[time=736] shannu nah. His love is everlasting, and his mercy never fails. Shannu nah, shannu nah, shannu nah,
[time=746] I'll follow in the path of man. With Nails cars in his hands. His love is everlasting, and his mercy never fails.
[time=763] Shannu nah, shannu nah, shannu nah. I'll follow in the path of man. Nails cars in his hands.
[time=776] His love is everlasting, and his mercy never fails. Shannu nah, shannu nah,
[time=786] I'll follow in the path of man. Nails cars in his hands.
[time=806] Hello, and welcome again to the Bible Hour. We're really glad that you're tuned in for this portion of our program.
[time=816] Russ, this is another, we've had a great week here. Lots of activity during the holiday season. Your folks have come and gone,
[time=824] but it was really a good time here at the church.
[time=827] Well, I'll tell you, it's almost as if we've gone through a huge event in our lives, and coming back to church this morning,
[time=833] and realizing what we've had in the patriotic panorama, and the incredible celebration and rejoicing in the fact that God has allowed us to be citizens of the United States of America.
[time=842] It's a tremendous memory. I cherish it close to my heart.
[time=846] Well, I'm really glad, too, that we had the opportunity to celebrate the hundreds and even thousands of young men that have already returned from Desert Storm safely,
[time=853] and even sung them, some among our own congregation. We're grateful for that.
[time=858] Russ, we talked about your folks visiting here. You're going to be gone from us for a couple of weeks.
[time=863] That's right. We leave the 11th, July 11th, which is Thursday for us, and we'll be going out to California where I'll do a wedding.
[time=870] It's a very special occasion. My wife's sister is getting married, and I actually was the one who led her to the Lord when she was about 12 years of age,
[time=879] and then she lived with us for about five years as she was going through college, and we saw her fall in love with this young man named Rob Courtney.
[time=886] And so we'll go out and perform the ceremony, and then we'll also, it works out perfectly as far as timing.
[time=892] We'll go on to about our ninth annual summer vacation at a place called Lake Shasta.
[time=898] So we'll be gone for two Sundays, and then back in the pulpit and preaching again.
[time=902] Sounds like you'll have a wonderful time with your family, and I'm familiar with the area in which you're going to go, and it's beautiful.
[time=908] I know it'll be very rustle for you. We're grateful that we have men on our staff who can fill in for you.
[time=914] Tim Teder and Jim Pearson are going to be speaking in the next couple of weeks, and I'm sure that the people will enjoy them.
[time=921] And Russ, you've also been very involved here in the ministry of your messages in grace, on the theme of grace.
[time=929] Yeah, the grace of God. We'll go back again, of course, this Sunday to that, and I think for several other Sundays, as I tried to compact,
[time=938] all I wanted to say out of Romans 6 into one message, it resisted that tenaciously, and so we'll have probably two, maybe three, messages out of Romans 6,
[time=948] trying to conclude our thoughts on the nature of grace.
[time=951] And this morning, we move into very powerful theological grounds as to who we are inside because of our relationship with Christ.
[time=960] Are we an old man and a new man, warring it out, or are we a new creature that has been set free to live to the glory of God?
[time=967] And so it should prove to be an exciting study.
[time=970] Well, this is an encouragement to all of you that are watching today to continue watching the Bible hour every week,
[time=976] so that you can get the entire series of messages on the grace of our Lord from Romans.
[time=982] And then we want to tell you about a new book that we have. It's entitled "God's Answers for Your Life." This is another little booklet. Last month we had "God's Promises." This is God's answers for your life.
[time=993] It talks about how you can know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, how you can grow in the Lord, and how you can mature in Him.
[time=1001] There are other topics that are very important for your Christian life, and I hope that you'll write for this booklet today.
[time=1006] You can receive God's answers for your life by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1018] Once again that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1028] Well, also we've had a good time on Wednesday nights in our summer celebration. We just had the Continental Orchestra and Singers, and they were dynamic.
[time=1036] On July 17th we're going to have Joel Alvarez, and the people in Fort Wayne are probably familiar with that name because he's the director of our crime stoppers here in this area.
[time=1046] He'll be with us on Wednesday evening July 17th at 7 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1053] While we're delighted, as I said earlier, that you joined us for the Bible hour, and we hope that you'll stay tuned for Pastor Russell's message in just a few moments.
[time=1060] Stay with us, please.
[time=1065] If we can worship freely, and we can reach out with the gospel of the good news of Jesus Christ to our community, Lord, we're thankful for a staff that you provided us who does that so faithfully from the pulpit with the youth in this community with our music as we've seen demonstrated by the patriotic panorama this week.
[time=1088] Lord, we're thankful for them, and we're thankful for a people, a congregation with a heart to serve, with a heart to give. Lord, now as we give, we pray that we might do it cheerfully.
[time=1100] No, Lord, even joyfully this morning as an act of worship and a demonstration of our love to you. Lord, may these gifts and ties be used wisely. May we live lives that are pleasing to you. Lord, that we might do it faithfully, and I precious holy name. Amen.
[time=1130] O'er the land of the free, promise of hope and freedom, symbol of liberty, red, white, and blue are its colors, colors both brilliant and clear.
[time=1159] Colors with far deeper meaning, then that at first may appear. Red is for blood, of patriots who have died to free us. White is for justice and government of all.
[time=1190] Oh, it's for honor and faith in all reading. This is my flag. This is o' glory, the red, white, and blue.
[time=1220] God bless America, land that I love, stand beside her, and guide her through the night with the light from above, from the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans.
[time=1248] White with hope, God bless America, my home sweet, home, God bless America, my home sweet, home.
[time=1279] Proudly it waves upon you, over the land of the free, promise of hope and freedom, symbol of liberty, red, white, and blue are its colors.
[time=1306] Colors with brilliant and clear, colors with far deeper meaning, then that at first may appear. Red is for blood, of patriots who have died to free us.
[time=1332] White is for justice and government of all.
[time=1341] Oh, it's for honor and faith in all we do. This is my flag.
[time=1359] This is o' glory, the red, white, and blue.
[time=1374] All made way for the home of the brave, all made way for the land of the free,
[time=1395] all made way for the home of the brave.
[time=1417] In the fall of 1991, Karen Renner, a member of our sanctuary choir, put a yellow ribbon on a tree behind the church.
[time=1424] Her son Rick had just left for duty in the Desert Storm War. Last week, Karen removed the ribbon since Rick just recently came back from his tour of duty.
[time=1434] We praise God that Rick returned safely, and our thanks to all of you who prayed for our soldiers during this recent conflict.
[time=1448] Let's pray together. Father, we're so thankful that our boys are home, that our land is free, and that we can continue to use our liberty for the cause of Christ,
[time=1458] that this great nation can continue to proclaim and herald the truth of Jesus Christ around the globe.
[time=1465] Thank you for the great honor, the privilege, and help us to be faithful to that responsibility. Let me pray these things in your name. Amen.
[time=1474] Well, I guess one of the greatest joys in all of the ministry is to see a transformed life,
[time=1480] to see a life that has been radically changed by the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1485] And I think of several names when I think of this category in my mind, a guy by the name of Joe Feinstein.
[time=1492] I met several years ago, received a phone call from him. He was the elder of a church called Foothill Baptist Church in Sylmar, California,
[time=1499] where I eventually ended up pastoring for a couple of years.
[time=1502] He was a gracious man over the phone, and we had a tremendous chat, and we, through those two years, built a very deep and lasting relationship for which I am thankful.
[time=1511] But I'll never forget the first day I met the man. Having spoken with him on the phone and understood his position,
[time=1517] he comes out of a car door and walks to greet me before we enter a restaurant, and here is Joe Feinstein.
[time=1524] Hair down over his collar kind of flipped up over the back, a huge bushy beard, tattooed all over his arms, bell bottoms.
[time=1533] It's 1990 folks, bell bottoms, you know, I'm thinking, "Who is this guy?" And in addition to coming to realize he is an incredibly godly, devoted man to the cause of Christ,
[time=1544] he grew up as a hippie and eventually became the president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Hell's Angels.
[time=1551] The man was unbelievable. He'd lead these long weekend excursions he used to tell me about, and how they'd get going on their motorcycles and go up to a place like Lake Tahoe and do all the drugs and drink all the beer,
[time=1562] and have all the sex they could possibly have until they were too worn out to do any more of it, and then they'd come back and sell some drugs through the rest of the week so they wouldn't have to buy their own drugs the next time they went.
[time=1571] And just this unbelievably gross, horrible, sinful lifestyle, and yet here he is today leading this church, a godly man.
[time=1579] You say to yourself, "What is it that has the power to transform a person to that degree?"
[time=1586] Another man I think of, Tom Meheras, maybe you know of Tom, he's a pastor in Manhattan doing a wonderful work for the city of New York.
[time=1595] He came from Thessaloniki, he's a Greek. He was raised on the streets of New York with no Christian influence, no upbringing whatsoever,
[time=1602] got into drugs and rock and roll and sex and eventually became a rock and roll star, had his own band, did the whole thing,
[time=1609] eventually overdosed, almost killed himself, somebody drug him off the screen lake, Word of Life.
[time=1615] He met Jack Wordson walking out of a fog one morning and thought it was God, except that Jesus Christ is his personal Lord and Savior,
[time=1622] and now is the pastor of a thousand member church in the middle of Manhattan with a private Christian school, a godly family,
[time=1629] and he's on fire for the cause of Christ. What happened? How does it work? And more importantly, how can that stuff keep happening in my life?
[time=1637] I want to continue to be transformed by the power of Jesus Christ.
[time=1642] Well, there's a chapter in the Bible more than any other chapter that speaks about this transforming power of God.
[time=1650] If we were going to speak about creation, we'd go to Genesis 1 and 2. If we're going to speak about the fall, we'd go to Genesis 3.
[time=1656] Talk about the holiest of God, Isaiah 6. Talk about heaven, Revelation 21. Talk about the transforming power of God in a person's life.
[time=1664] We've got to go to Romans, chapter 6. Romans, chapter 6. One of my all-time, all-time favorite chapters in all of Scripture.
[time=1674] And thinking about this message and hoping to finish up this little series on the grace of God, realizing that the next couple of weeks I'll be out in California on vacation,
[time=1683] and I'm thinking this is perfect. It'll wrap it up just right. This will be my last message.
[time=1687] But in my study this week, there was absolutely no way I could confine all that Paul has to say about living a transformed life to one message.
[time=1697] So we're going to get part of it this morning, and when I get back, maybe two or three more messages.
[time=1701] And the other thing is, this message is going to raise questions in your mind. This will not be one of those, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
[time=1708] I've heard that before messages. This will be really? Come on, tell me this isn't happening.
[time=1713] And so for that reason, we'll need some more messages to try to help clear up some of the confusion I create this morning.
[time=1720] As you remember, Romans, chapter 6, Paul is answering an objection about the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1727] He spent the first three chapters of Romans condemning the whole world, bringing everybody, Jew and Gentile, religious and irreligious, moral and immoral,
[time=1736] and everybody accountable to God because they've broken his law, broken the law of God.
[time=1742] And let me just read it to you, but with chapter 3, he changes everything on everybody and says, now apart from the law,
[time=1749] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe, being justified as a free gift of grace.
[time=1759] He says, I've just brought you all to be accountable before God because you've broken his law, but now forget about the law because being justified with God is the product of his grace and it's a free gift.
[time=1770] And by the time he gets to chapter 5, as we saw last week, he's driving this point home with a sledgehammer saying that no matter how sinful you become,
[time=1778] no matter how great your transgressions, no matter how rotten you are as a human being, the grace of God super abounds, it covers it all, you simply can't out-sin the grace of God.
[time=1791] And any time a person preaches the true gospel, that salvation is through faith by grace, it is a gift of God, that person lays himself open to the charge of teaching lawlessness or antonomianism,
[time=1804] the idea that you can come to Christ and then live any way you want, live as sinful as you want because the grace of God always super abounds, you can never out-sin him.
[time=1815] When you preach the true gospel that it was God reaching down to a lost humanity who in the person of Jesus Christ paid the price so that they without paying any price could be forgiven and forgiven and forgiven and forgiven than your subject to being charged with preaching lawlessness.
[time=1831] In fact, it's a false gospel that preaches works as a part of your salvation, a prerequisite of salvation being human achievement or hard work or personal effort or religious deeds.
[time=1841] These are distortions of the gospel and every time they show up in the New Testament, Paul says anathema or curse you, it's the strongest possible condemnation that can be found in a single term in the Greek New Testament, anathema, if you change the gospel, if you pollute the gospel, if you make it anything other than free grace, anathema.
[time=1862] But when you preach it as free grace, you get charged with this idea of lawlessness, anttonomianism.
[time=1870] And that is what he is answering. And what does he say? He says, "May it never be." Verse 2.
[time=1876] Impossible, perish the thought. The Greek idiom couldn't be any stronger. Don't ever consider that to be the true gospel.
[time=1884] Don't ever think that because the gospel of Jesus Christ is a free gift by grace that once receiving it, you can then live and tread on grace and sin and sin and sin and sin knowing that he'll always forgive you.
[time=1896] That is not the implication of salvation by faith through grace. Why? Verse 2. How shall we who died to sin still live in it? And with that he begins about a 14 verse argument to explain the why that doesn't happen.
[time=1916] Last week I just kind of reinforced the no. No, absolutely not. And we ran through the New Testament examining the Scriptures and it is all too clear that though you come to Christ, if indeed you truly come to Christ, your life will not continue or remain or abide and sin.
[time=1933] And we just kind of reinforced the no. But this morning we have the opportunity to look through these verses and find out why.
[time=1940] Why is that true? Why is it that when a person really comes to Christ and they're truly born again, they don't continue to live in sin as a characteristic pattern of their life?
[time=1950] What are the dynamics of salvation which occur in the soul of a human being which makes the idea of a true believer living in sin absolutely repulsive and impossible?
[time=1960] And that's what he begins to address and it's exciting to study it. He begins again, verse 2. How shall we who have died to sin still live in it?
[time=1971] Now he builds his argument around three key words. The word no, he says first you've got to know some things. This is information, doctrinal truth that I'm going to direct to your mind.
[time=1983] I've got to fill your mind with some truth about the reality of salvation. When I'm done with that I want you to consider it so or to count it to be true, verse 11.
[time=1993] He says, in my version of the Bible it says even so consider in the NIV it would be count. In the King James version it would be to reckon.
[time=2002] And it's a word that directs itself to our heart, to our belief, to our ability to conjure up the faith if you will or to exercise the faith that God has given to believe what he just told us we had to know in the previous verses.
[time=2014] So first I want you to know some things, then I want you to believe some things, to count some things, and then I want you to present yourself, verses verse 13, to present or to offer yourself.
[time=2025] And do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness but present or offer yourselves to God as those alive from the dead.
[time=2034] And this last word directs itself to your will. So first here are some things you need to know in your mind.
[time=2041] Second you got to believe it in your heart and thirdly you've got to exercise your will and change your behavior based upon what I've told you you need to know and told you you need to believe.
[time=2052] This morning we will only get into what he says we have to know. We will only be able to talk about what he says we have to know.
[time=2060] I want you to notice he uses this word no three times in these first nine verses verse three or do you not know verse six knowing this verse nine knowing that Christ this whole introductory part of his argument is directed to your mind there are some things he wants you to know.
[time=2084] What are they verse three do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death.
[time=2097] Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father so we too might walk in newness of life.
[time=2108] The first thing he says I want you to know the first thing you've got to understand about why believers don't come to Christ and then continue to live on and on and on as a characteristic pattern his sin is because number one got to know you've been baptized into the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2122] Now this is hard for us because when we became Christians we didn't experience that I mean with our senses there isn't a memory in our minds of being baptized into the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2135] It happens by the ministry of the Holy Spirit 1 Corinthians 12 13 at the moment of salvation by the spirit of God we're baptized into the person of Jesus Christ it happened but we don't remember it.
[time=2146] It wasn't something we experienced experientially and so he says you just got to know this I just got to tell you this.
[time=2154] Somehow by a miracle of God we were taken back 2,000 years and baptized into the person of Jesus Christ the word baptized or baptism is a term that in the first century was used of changing the identity of things.
[time=2169] For example a garment and you've got a light colored garment and there's a whole big thing of dye and it's full of scarlet and you take this cloth or this garment and you put it in, you dip it, you baptize it into this scarlet you pull it out and now it's not a light colored garment anymore it's red.
[time=2186] It's bright red it's scarlet it takes on the identity of that into which it was dipped.
[time=2192] You and I have been dipped if you will dipped into the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2197] And as a result when he died on the cross you died on the cross and when he was buried you were buried and when he rose again to walk in newness of life you were too.
[time=2207] Look at verse 4, it's hard to believe isn't it.
[time=2209] Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death in order that as Christ was raised from the dead to the glory of the Father so we too might walk in newness of life.
[time=2225] You and I, by a miracle of God at the point of salvation, have been baptized into Jesus Christ and therefore into his death, into his burial and into his resurrection.
[time=2239] Let's go to the second word knowing verse 6.
[time=2242] So what?
[time=2244] Well what does that do to me?
[time=2246] That sounds nice.
[time=2247] But what does that do to me?
[time=2249] Knowing this verse 6.
[time=2251] Three things that our old self was crucified, that's number one.
[time=2256] Number two, that our body of sin might be done away with, that's number two, and number three, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
[time=2267] That we should no longer be slaves to sin.
[time=2271] Let's start with the first thing in verse 6.
[time=2274] The first thing that we are to understand as a result of being baptized into the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ is verse 6, that our old self was crucified with him.
[time=2289] Now what's our old self?
[time=2293] Our old self is the person we were born.
[time=2296] It's at conception and sin my mother did conceive me.
[time=2300] It's the Adamic nature, it's the unregenerate nature, it's that sinful, depraved, horrible, rotten thing that I am when I am conceived.
[time=2310] You know it's interesting, we don't sin, we sin because we're sinners, you've heard that, that's true.
[time=2316] You perform acts of sin in your life, an unregenerate person does because he is a sinner.
[time=2322] We sin because of our nature.
[time=2324] We're not born pure and holy and righteous and true in our physical birth.
[time=2328] And then all of a sudden we're walking around the sin cursed world and we slip and fall into sin and all of a sudden that's contaminated us and now we're sinners because of some sin we've done.
[time=2337] It's the opposite.
[time=2338] We are born sinners, we are conceived in sin, we have a depraved nature.
[time=2343] Our prevailing disposition is against God from the moment of conception and because of that prevailing disposition at enmity with God when we finally get out of the womb and get able to make some choices in our life, we choose according to who we are, we start sinning because we're sinners.
[time=2357] That's the thing that got crucified.
[time=2361] That's your old self.
[time=2363] Your old self got crucified, the unregenerate nature, the Adam man, the Adamic nature.
[time=2370] It's a marvelous truth.
[time=2373] And I'm going to need to have you come with me to a couple of scriptures this morning if you will so we can support and fully understand what Paul is saying.
[time=2380] Let's begin in 2 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=2383] It's a familiar verse 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 and I will take the time to let you turn there this morning because this material is so foundational to our Christian lives.
[time=2396] So I hope you'll be a Berean with me this morning that you'll really think with me, take some notes and ponder this truth even after the Sunday service is over.
[time=2405] 2 Corinthians 5 verse 17, it says this, "Therefore if any man is in Christ he is a new creature, the old things have passed away, behold new things have come."
[time=2425] What he's saying here is at the point of your salvation because you were dipped into the person of Jesus Christ baptized into him into a intimate union of loving relationship and therefore went through death, burial and resurrection your old self has been crucified.
[time=2439] They say, "Well then what am I? What am I now? If what I was born and got killed, what am I? You are a new creature.
[time=2447] Old things have passed away. New things have come. New things have come."
[time=2455] You say, "Well what are those new things?" That's kind of generic, new things, what are they?
[time=2461] That is answered over in the book of Ephesians. Did you go with me to Ephesians chapter 4 and we'll look at verse 24?
[time=2469] Ephesians 4, 24.
[time=2477] Ephesians 4, 24. It says, "And put on the new self which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth."
[time=2493] Tremendous contrast. When you and I were created the first time in our mother's womb we were created in sin.
[time=2501] We were given a prevailing disposition which was that at enmity with God and the fist is shaking in the face of God saying, "I hate you and I may demonstrate that as I grew up by being a very religious self righteous person or I may demonstrate that as being a horrible depraved sinner immoral lifestyle, but in either case all of us come into the world going, "I hate you God because there's something in me that is at enmity with you."
[time=2522] And the reality is at our salvation conversion experience we are born again, that's the whole idea of being regenerated.
[time=2530] We become new creatures in Christ, the old thing passes away, the new thing comes, what's the new thing?
[time=2537] The new thing is that our new creatureliness has been created in holiness and righteousness of the truth.
[time=2544] Born again, regenerated. Do you remember the nation of Israel? For 2000 years they were called hard-hearted, they were stiff-necked, they were dull of hearing.
[time=2558] Over and over again the mercies of God were extended to them and yet they spurned it over and over and over until their whole nation was characteristically hard-hearted and God finally rejected them.
[time=2569] When finally he sent his son Jesus Christ and in Matthew chapter 12 they looked at Jesus and said, "You are of the devil" and Jesus turned his back on the nation of Israel for a while and began to build the church.
[time=2581] But you know God has promised to restore the nation of Israel and he will do it, but he will do it differently than he did it the first time and I'd like to show that to you.
[time=2590] Ezekiel chapter 36, that's a major prophet right before Daniel right after lamentations. Ezekiel chapter 36, God has made a wonderful promise in his new covenant.
[time=2608] It's what we call the new covenant and when he talks about the second coming of Christ and what God will do for the people of Israel and restoring them to the land, but it's so much more than just possession of the land.
[time=2619] Are you there? Ezekiel 36? Look at this is wonderful. Verse 25 is unbelievable.
[time=2630] God says then, "I will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean.
[time=2637] I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols." This is the promise of God to forgive them, to pardon them, but there's more.
[time=2645] Look at verse 26, "more over or additionally or as an extra bonus, if you will, watch.
[time=2652] I will give you a new heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
[time=2665] I'll take that hard-heartedness right out of you and in its place I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit." Small s, not capital s, the capital s is in verse 27.
[time=2678] "I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances." Finally the day will come when the nation of Israel will observe the ordinances of God. Why?
[time=2694] Because verse 25, "He will cleanse them and forgive them." Verse 26, "He'll give them a new prevailing disposition. He'll create them new on the inside, a new heart, a new spirit, and then he will enable them." Verse 27 with the Spirit of God.
[time=2711] Those are the spiritual characteristics of the new covenant that God has made with the nation of Israel. And here is the truth, the astounding truth that Paul reveals in the New Testament.
[time=2721] Twice at least he calls himself a minister of the what? New covenant. When you take communion in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 he says, "This blood is given to me," and I got to read it, I can't even memorize, come with me. 1 Corinthians 11.
[time=2737] This is amazing. He says, "We are partakers of the new covenant." In the same way, I'm in 1 Corinthians 11.25, he took the cup also after supper saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me."
[time=2758] If you're still finding Corinthians, just skip over to 2 Corinthians, and we'll go to verse 6 in chapter 3. He says it again.
[time=2769] "Who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit for the letter kills but the Spirit gives life."
[time=2781] Now this may sound different. This may sound peculiar, this may sound strange, this may raise a number of questions in your mind, and in the weeks to come I'll endeavor to work with some of those questions that I will anticipate in your minds, but here's how sometimes it is taught about a believer.
[time=2802] God's just raining down blessings on us, isn't he? Sometimes it's taught this way, that when you come to Christ, God gives you a new nature, and it jumps right on inside of you along with your old nature.
[time=2816] And you're now this dichotomous thing, and the old nature is warning against the new nature, and they're even likened to a black dog and a white dog.
[time=2824] And whichever dog you feed the most, if you feed the black dog with the less of a flesh, then he gets big and strong and he begins to rule in there, and the way to get victory over that is to starve the black dog and start feeding the white dog, and then the white dog takes charge.
[time=2837] My friends, it's a helpful illustration because there is a war going on inside of us, but it is not between two natures.
[time=2846] At the point of salvation, we are new creatures in Christ, created in holiness and righteousness of the truth, 2 Peter 1, 4 adds that we are partakers of the divine nature, we are new, and there is a new prevailing disposition within us which longs to obey God.
[time=2864] Salvation is more than forgiveness, it is transformation, it changes the essence of who we are inextricably and radically and irreversibly, we become new creatures in Christ.
[time=2877] Let me show you a group of guys that this didn't happen to. Go to 2 Peter with me.
[time=2883] 2 Peter 2, you've got a bunch of false prophets, false teachers, and you see they've heard about Jesus, they even mouthed the words of Jesus, and they've walked along the way of the Christian path for a little while, but they never got regenerated.
[time=2903] The nature inside of them was never changed, and look at what happens and look at how they are referred to. You introduced to them in the first verse, but false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the master, interesting term, master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
[time=2932] Now the narrative or the discussion continues to run, but let's pick it up in verse 18.
[time=2939] For speaking out arrogant words of vanity, they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in air, promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption, they are slaves of corruption.
[time=2959] For by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved, the ushers will now go prepare the life rafts, we'll finish this up and be right with you.
[time=2976] How firm a foundation.
[time=2983] I'm competing with God, you understand, for your attention, this is difficult, I am actually competing with my God for your attention about his truth.
[time=2991] Lord, please, I don't hear it, do you hear it? No, okay we'll go ahead.
[time=3004] Verse 21. See, God answers prayer.
[time=3011] For those of you who are watching on television, it's raining really hard right now, and we can hear it on the roof.
[time=3021] The righteous prayer of a godly man.
[time=3023] I'm sorry, I'll go on, I'll go on.
[time=3025] For verse 21, it would be better for them, listen now, it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.
[time=3039] Now stop and think with me for a minute, you've got a bunch of false prophets.
[time=3043] They've heard about the gospel of Jesus Christ, they've made a profession of faith, they've even made a profession of being teachers of that faith, but they deny the master who bought them.
[time=3052] And they begin to turn back towards their sensuality, they prove in fact that they were never really saved at all.
[time=3061] Look at verse 14, they have eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin.
[time=3066] Remember the message last week? They never cease from sin, and they entice on stable souls having a heart trained and greed accursed children.
[time=3075] But here's the point I'm driving at, verse 22. Listen to his description of them.
[time=3080] It has happened to them according to the true proverb, a dog returns to its own vomit, and a sow after washing returns to wallowing in the mire.
[time=3091] Did you have a dog when you were growing up as a kid? I did, his name was Barron, and I will never forget the first time he did this.
[time=3099] He started dry heaving and then eventually out came lunch, and there it was.
[time=3107] I thought, man, you must be sick, dog. I'm glad you got whatever it was out of you.
[time=3112] This must be a very healthy thing that God has given you as a dog to be able to expel from inside of you, that which you don't want anymore.
[time=3121] But to my horror, he returned and ate it again. And you say, this is gross. I agree, but it's in the Bible, so we have to teach it.
[time=3132] This is sickening. This dog vomits up and then chooses to take it back inside of himself.
[time=3140] That's what dogs do. They don't even have to be a weird dog. Normal dogs do this kind of thing.
[time=3145] This is instinctive to a dog. The same is true of a pig. My sister at 16 years of age wanted a pig for her birthday, so we got her one.
[time=3155] Called her Gertie, little Gertie. And Gertie was so much fun. We'd bring her in the house, we'd have lots of fun with her.
[time=3161] She'd be there at the dinner room table and sleep with my sister sometimes. Eventually the pig got too big, so we only brought the pig in on special occasions.
[time=3169] Well, in order to do that, you had to wash him up. And so we'd get a little Gertie and we'd scrub her down, you know, and get her all fixed up.
[time=3176] She'd come in the house and it was kind of a novelty and we'd blow our friends away with that.
[time=3179] And then we would be finished with Gertie and Gertie would return outside and go straight for wear.
[time=3184] The mud. She would begin to wallow in the mud. Why? Because she's a pig. That's what pigs do. That's how pigs act.
[time=3196] A pig is dirty on the outside because a pig wants to be dirty. Not a moral thing here. A pig loves to just roll around and get it all over him because there's something, that's what pigs do, that's instinctive.
[time=3209] Do you see what Peter is saying? When you become a Christian, God changes who you are.
[time=3218] He radically transforms your nature from having a prevailing disposition at enmity with God and longing for sin.
[time=3226] He radically changes you. He makes you a new creature. He creates you in holiness and righteousness of the truth.
[time=3235] He makes you a partaker of the divine nature such that now your prevailing disposition doesn't want to return to your vomit or to return to the mire, now spiritually thinking of sin, but to live for God.
[time=3249] And you do that because of what he has done inside of you. It becomes the longing of your heart. People live like what they are.
[time=3258] People live out on the outside what they are on the inside. And the reason people live horribly sinful lives, whether they profess Christ or not profess Christ, it's because they're sinners inside.
[time=3269] And the reason other people live godly righteous lives is because God has transformed their insides and made them new in Christ.
[time=3278] The power of the grace of God not only to forgive but to transform. It's awesome. You got to love it.
[time=3286] More happens to us at the point of our salvation than forgiveness of sins and no longer having to spend eternity in hell.
[time=3292] We get freed, freed from the power of sin because we died in Jesus Christ. We were buried in Jesus Christ.
[time=3298] We rose again in Jesus Christ to walk in newness of life. Well what does that mean?
[time=3303] Well for starters it means we've been made new in Jesus. Amen. Praise God.
[time=3311] Unbelievable truth. And in the years that I've worked with youth, these last 12 years, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them, a parent will inevitably come into my office and say I don't understand what's happened to little Johnny.
[time=3323] You know, we got him going to church as a little kid and he said his Bible verses and he even prayed to receive Jesus and we sent him to all the day camps and the summer camps and the retreats and we stuck stickers on his forehead and we gave him Bibles and we got him saved into Jesus and now he's 14, 15 years old
[time=3339] and he doesn't want to do with Jesus at all. And we're not talking about an occasional bout with sin, we're talking about a habitual pattern of life and now this kid is on his way.
[time=3351] Reminds me of these crazy lion tamer's who say they can domesticate a wild beast and they get this poor helpless little lion at about two weeks old and they start to nurture it and feed it and gets a little older and they start to reinforce its domesticated behavior with positive reinforcement
[time=3366] and suddenly they say see, we've taken the wild beast out of this lion until the lion kills for the first time and then they quickly usher him off to a zoo or a jungle.
[time=3379] They don't want him in their house anymore because that is still a what? A wild beast and wild beasts kill people.
[time=3386] Wild beasts are not domesticated by some external prepping that we do on the outside, the same is true of Christianity.
[time=3393] You can bring a person up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord and we should and we all try hard and we can bring them Bible verses and we can encourage their little prayers of faith towards Jesus Christ.
[time=3406] We've been sharing with you today the ministry of our Sanctuary Choir and soloist Chad Veneta and Karim Sikafus.
