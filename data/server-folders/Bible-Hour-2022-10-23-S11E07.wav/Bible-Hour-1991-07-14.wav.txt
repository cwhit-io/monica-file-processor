[time=0] In the last Olympics, we heard about the tragic story of Ben Johnson.
[time=6] Johnson was the gold medal winner in the 100-meter dash, but he had his gold medal stripped away.
[time=12] It seems that Ben Johnson, in searching for an edge, searching for strength, searching for more power, had injected himself with anabolic steroids.
[time=20] He lost his gold medal.
[time=23] But you know, Ben Johnson's tragedy is not a whole lot unlike a lot of people walking through life every day, they're looking for an edge, they're looking for power.
[time=32] Jesus Christ said, "I am sufficient, I can supply the power that you need.
[time=37] Come with us this morning as we look from 2 Peter at the quest for power."
[time=54] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=60] Thank you for joining us.
[time=61] In the absence of Pastor Moore, Pastor Jim Pearson will be speaking today.
[time=66] His message is entitled, "The Quest for Power." What are you willing to do to gain an advantage in life?
[time=73] Perhaps you wouldn't use steroids as Ben Johnson did.
[time=76] In your Christian life, it is important to remember that Christ has said that he is sufficient.
[time=81] We don't need anything else.
[time=84] Have your Bible open to 2 Peter, chapter 1, verses 3 through 9 for today's message.
[time=90] Before the message, we will be ministered to by solos from Dave Cake entitled, "He Is Able."
[time=97] And my Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=102] Let's join our worship service as the sanctuary choir sings, "God of my Praise."
[time=114] Oh, come ever singing to God, oh, my praise He is the rock, oh, my salvation, oh, come
[time=135] sing to God, oh, my praise He is the rock, oh, my salvation, oh, say, come ever, I will
[time=149] sing of His heaven so let's pray, may He will shine into His name with the voice of
[time=157] God, let's hope the Lord our holy God, bow down before His name, worship with our
[time=170] hearts our praise He loves to hear, oh, come let us sing to the God, oh, my praise
[time=184] He is the rock, oh, my salvation, oh, come ever singing to God, oh, my praise We have
[time=200] our praise, we have our praise, we have our praise, we have our praise, we have our
[time=479] singing with us and fellowshipping together in this manner. We continue with music now as David, K, God, and God alone. Let's listen to his message and song.
[time=491] Like hearing through a window, played with rain, emotions run together in a
[time=518] cloud of doubt and pain. We pray as best we can, now we must leave it in his hand.
[time=535] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see, he is able, even though it seems impossible
[time=554] to me, he is able. But if he chooses not to move in the way we pray, he would.
[time=572] Confident that he's working all together for our Lord. I will stand behind his word for
[time=586] he is able. I seem to want you night and day. I'll quick on allow your heart to be torn.
[time=616] This way, does he listen when you call, or is he even there at all?
[time=632] Yet I know when my eyes fail to see, he is able, even though it seems
[time=648] impossible to be, he is able. But if he chooses not to move in the way we pray, he would.
[time=668] Confident he's working all together for our good. I will stand behind his word for he is able.
[time=694] And as a night he is waiting to die with you, and evaporate away, I'll stand to face one
[time=707] more today. And I'll stand behind his word for he is able.
[time=722] He is able, he is able, he is able.
[time=740] Hello and thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour. Our pastor Russell Moore is on vacation. In fact, he has a wedding in Los Angeles this weekend. His sister-in-law is getting married and he is performing the ceremony. So they'll be with family for the next couple of weeks. I'm happy to announce though that next week our associate pastor Tim Teder will be speaking. He's very active in our youth program leading that program and is quite a program for the entire summer for our young people. And today I'd like to welcome again our associate pastor Jim Pearson. Good morning, Jim.
[time=773] Good morning, Pete.
[time=774] Nice to have you back on the set and I look forward to your message today. Tell us a little bit about what you're going to speak about. Pete, I'm speaking about the quest for power.
[time=782] Everybody's looking for power. Everybody's looking for an edge. But Christ said, I am your power. I'm sufficient to meet your needs. And that's what I'm speaking about this morning.
[time=791] We look forward to your messages. You were such a big help during the interim time and we didn't have a pastor for over a year and spoke so many times and I'm sure that people are looking forward to your message today. And Jim, you've also been involved in our Wednesday program. We've had some outstanding events take place on Wednesday evening. There are more to come yet this summer.
[time=810] Pete, we've got a great summer lined up. I really think it's going to be a great time for the people here at Blackhawk. Coming up in the weeks ahead, we have some noted theologians and authors like Homer Kent, creation scientist Scott Hughes and one of our own Professor Ron Scarf from Summit Christian College. It's going to be a great time. I'm really looking forward to our summer celebration and the challenge to our people.
[time=831] And Jim, along with the speakers, we've had some good music. We had the Continental Orchestra and singers just a couple of weeks ago. And we look ahead to Wednesday, July 24th. Dan
[time=843] Lilly will be with us. Dan is the Minister of Music at Bible Baptist Church in Auburn.
[time=848] He plays the trumpet and sings well, doing a record right now. So that'll be a great time of music. Come and join with us on Wednesday evening, July 24th. We'd be glad to have you
[time=859] join us for an evening of music that evening. We've been offering on the Bible Hour a booklet
[time=866] entitled "God's Answers." A great little book with a lot of scripture in it and subtitles
[time=872] that will help us in the particular needs that we have that are with us in the world today. It's a great book and we'd like to offer it to you today absolutely free. You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and
[time=889] the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne,
[time=897] Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Well, Jim, this is the summertime and we have a lot of
[time=905] people that go away for vacations but we also have some people that come from other states to visit relatives in Fort Wayne. So it kind of balances out and we look forward to the visitors that we have in our church and if you don't have a church home, we'd love to welcome you to Black Hawk. Come and join with us in our services on Sunday morning live.
[time=925] We'd love to have you come and visit. We go back to the regular portion of our service now with some music from David Cake and then the message from our Associate Pastor, Pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=940] As I look back on this road, I travel. I've seen so many times he's carried me through
[time=969] and if there's one thing that I've learned in my life, my Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=985] My Redeemer is faithful and true. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1029] My light rejoices when I read the promise. There is a place I am preparing for you.
[time=1044] I know someday I'll see my heart face to face, cause my Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1060] My Redeemer is faithful and true. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1074] Everything he has said he will do. And every morning his mercy's on you.
[time=1091] My Redeemer is faithful and true. And in a situation he has proved his love to me.
[time=1106] And I love the understanding he gives my grace to you. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1123] Everything he has said he will do. And every morning his mercy's on you.
[time=1139] My Redeemer is faithful. My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1169] Thank you David for that beautiful song.
[time=1184] Hershey Pennsylvania's game will be Black Hawk's loss. Did you catch the themes in those songs?
[time=1190] God is able. God is faithful. God is true. Yes he's able to meet any need that we have.
[time=1197] He's able to meet any need that you might have today. God is able.
[time=1201] Well this is a very special day, a very exciting day for me. It's always an exciting time to
[time=1207] get to share from the Word of God with my friends here at Black Hawk. But I have a special privilege this morning. I have some special friends that are visiting with me. Actually they're relatives that I haven't seen for about 36 years. And I want you to know that I have a cousin and his wife and children who've traveled 3,000 miles from Dundee Scotland
[time=1227] just to be here this morning in this worship service. Well I can't really say that. He did have some business in New York I think on the way. But he's here today. I'd like you to meet my cousin Brian, his wife Fiona and their sons David and Jonathan and also
[time=1242] my mother. And they're all from Dundee Scotland but my mother now lives in Toledo, Ohio.
[time=1247] Would you stand please if they might see who you are today? Thank you mom and I did shine
[time=1261] my shoes this morning. You don't have to ask me later. Well if you have a Bible with
[time=1268] you I'd like you to turn with me to the second or the book of Second Peter. The book of Second Peter, Chapter 1, the book of Second Peter, Chapter 1, a very very powerful set of verses
[time=1283] that Peter gives us concerning our sufficiency, our power in Jesus Christ. People are looking
[time=1290] for power everywhere. They're looking for strength, they're looking for courage to live their Christian lives. They're looking for strength to live the challenges of life that come. Christ tells us I am sufficient. I am all the power that you need. Second Peter,
[time=1307] Chapter 1, a recent edition of Sports Illustrated tells the tragic story about a man by the
[time=1315] name of Lyle Alzado, a former professional football player who now is suffering from an inoperable malignant brain tumor. Lyle Alzado says that he's convinced that the reason
[time=1326] he has that tumor today is because of a career long abuse of anabolic steroids and even taking
[time=1335] human growth hormones to give him more power and strength in his life. When Lyle Alzado
[time=1342] was a young college freshman recruited to play college football he was quite a specimen to behold. 195 pounds growing stronger all the time. He had life made. He was strong, he
[time=1355] was handsome, he was the type of guy that the other young man envied. He was playing college football. He had the physical ability to meet any physical challenge that came his way.
[time=1366] God had gifted him with a mighty and powerfully strong body. But Alzado writes in that article
[time=1373] that that wasn't enough. In an effort to gain an edge, in an effort to gain even more power,
[time=1379] strength Alzado writes that he began to take the anabolic steroids and later the human
[time=1385] growth hormone which he blames for the tumor that he now has. All I have nothing but sympathy
[time=1392] for Lyle Alzado and the reason I mentioned that today is to use him as an illustration.
[time=1398] For in our text this morning Peter is writing to new believers. New believers who believe
[time=1404] that they had to get more power in their life from some other source other than Jesus Christ.
[time=1410] They were looking for a power, a power that they could receive outside of the power that
[time=1416] God had already given to them, had already blessed them with at the time that they were born again. There was a group of false teachers who had invaded the early church. They were called Gnostics and they were telling those young Christians what you need to do is look within yourself, look within yourself for a higher knowledge, a higher power. And Peter
[time=1438] is going to tell the Christians in these verses that there is no higher power needed.
[time=1443] All that you need, a perfect sufficiency to meet every spiritual need that you have in
[time=1449] your life is yours today. It's given to you by the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ has given
[time=1455] all of us who are born again all of the spiritual power that we will ever need. His resources
[time=1461] are sufficient to meet every spiritual need that we might ever have. Indeed Peter is telling
[time=1468] the young Christians and telling us today that we need not look for any type of spiritual steroid. We have everything that we need in the power that he has given us when we have
[time=1479] trusted in him as our Savior and Lord. Let's read these verses verses 3 through 9 and as
[time=1486] we do that this morning I want us to see three important aspects of our sufficiency in Christ.
[time=1493] Three important aspects of our sufficiency in Christ, the fact that he has given us all the power that we need. Peter begins, "His divine power has given us everything we need
[time=1505] for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and
[time=1511] goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises so that through
[time=1517] them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused
[time=1523] by evil desires. For this reason make every effort to add to your faith goodness and to
[time=1529] goodness knowledge and to knowledge self-control and to self-control perseverance and to perseverance
[time=1535] godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love. For if you
[time=1542] possess these qualities in increasing measure they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But if anyone does not have them
[time=1553] he is nearsighted and blind and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.
[time=1559] This morning as we look at this important text I'd like us to first of all see in verses three and four the divine provision of power the divine provision. Peter very clearly and
[time=1571] concisely addresses the early Christians who were looking for another source of power in their life and he will tell them all that you need all the power you will ever need for every spiritual contingency you'll ever face was given to you at the time that you received Jesus Christ. Let's look at these verses again. In the first part of verse three he tells us
[time=1592] what that provision is. He says his divine power has given us everything we need for
[time=1599] life and godliness. Peter is saying to every believer God has made available all of the
[time=1606] divine power necessary to meet the challenges that come our way each day of our Christian
[time=1612] life. He is saying here that in this perverted corrupt and sinful world in which we live
[time=1619] we don't have to look any other place we already have all the power that we need it was given to us at the point of regeneration when we were born again given to us through the indwelling
[time=1630] power of the Holy Spirit. Peter says his divine power has been given to you everything that
[time=1637] we would ever need for life and godliness. Now when he says has given the grammar there
[time=1644] indicates a completed act he is saying it's been done it's over God has already given
[time=1650] it to you you don't have to reach out to attain it it's already there you don't need to look for anything else he's already given you what you need it's already given you what you need and what do they need it for he says for life and godliness what is life
[time=1666] well the life he's speaking about there is eternal life and eternal life means basically number one that we have everlasting life and a home someday in heaven we can know beyond
[time=1677] a shadow of a doubt that when we trust in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior we can know that we have a home in heaven for all of eternity that's a hope that we have and it's a power in our daily life but he is also speaking here about a power for eternal life
[time=1693] he is giving us the idea that eternal life is also something that we have each day each day as we walk the Christian life each day as we face face the challenges and the problems
[time=1704] and the decisions the spiritual decisions of our Christian life he is telling us that we have eternal life we have all of the power that we need he has given us all that we need
[time=1715] for life he's given us all that we need for godliness that means god likeness he has
[time=1722] given us the power that we need for godly living the power to break the bondage of sin and
[time=1728] to live a righteous and godly life the type of power that will allow us to evidence or manifest by our outward behavior the power that he has given us to show the transformation
[time=1740] that's gone on inside oh we can live holy and godly lives and he's telling us I've given
[time=1746] you all the power that you need you have it for life and for godliness we have the power
[time=1752] to live a godly life now notice as he goes on in the same verse he next tells us where
[time=1758] this power comes from notice he says that this power that we have for life and godliness comes through our knowledge of him who called us that's an interesting phrase where does
[time=1769] the power come from it comes from our knowledge of him now that word knowledge there does not
[time=1775] mean some type of cognitive factor information the idea of the word knowledge in this particular
[time=1781] phrase means a thorough knowledge the idea is that of being able to perceive something
[time=1787] completely of knowing something through and through and so Peter is telling these young
[time=1794] believers that if you will walk with Christ daily if you will walk with the one who called you you will gain in knowledge and he means by that you will gain in your knowledge your
[time=1805] intimate knowledge of Jesus Christ and over time you will get to know him through and through
[time=1811] you will learn to perceive him in a more and complete way we must perceive him completely
[time=1818] to lay hold of that power Peter is saying that it must become a daily priority in our
[time=1824] Christian lives to put Jesus first to put him in our relationship with him first to put scripture reading and prayer and communion with Jesus Christ first for he is saying it is by that means that we are able to take and develop the power that he is placed within us at the time that we are born again are you gaining in the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[time=1845] today are you walking with him daily are you getting to know him through and through and more intimately each day of your life the Bible teaches that's how we gain in that power
[time=1856] for Christian living but as he goes on he tells us more first of all in verses third
[time=1862] part of verse three in the first part of verse four he tells us how we got this power stay with me carefully this is a little bit tricky but we'll get through it he says that this knowledge comes to us through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and
[time=1878] goodness how did we get this he says that we got it from the glory and goodness of Jesus
[time=1884] Christ you might say well how do we get power from his glory and goodness I believe very strongly that what he is saying here is that we saw the glory the majesty we saw the power
[time=1896] we saw the moral excellence of Jesus Christ through the pages of scripture we saw it in
[time=1902] other people but we were drawn to him and he draws us to him as we see his marvelous wonderful
[time=1909] majesty and perfection and moral excellence and as we see that we are drawn to him by faith
[time=1918] I believe we're drawn to him because as we see his perfection in his excellence we begin to see our sin we begin to see our need and we see our need to come to him he says that
[time=1930] we are coming to him by his glory and goodness now watch verse four through these that means
[time=1936] through his glory and goodness he has given us his very great and precious promises through
[time=1943] his glory and goodness he has given us his very great and precious promises what he is saying here is as Jesus Christ drew us to him and as we came to him in simple faith realizing
[time=1956] our need at the time that we were born again at the time of regeneration he gave us his
[time=1962] indwelling Holy Spirit he gave us the spiritual resources that we need to meet the challenges
[time=1968] of life through these things he has given us his very great and precious promises now you might say
[time=1975] well what does he mean by promises well there are promises throughout scripture but we need to go no further than the writings of Peter to understand the promises that God has given us turn with me
[time=1987] for a moment to first Peter just back a few pages first Peter chapter one and we'll see some of
[time=1993] these promises of power that God has made to us first Peter chapter one verse three he says
[time=2002] praise be to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ in his great mercy he has given us new birth
[time=2009] he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ Peter is
[time=2016] saying through his mercy we have been born again through his mercy we have been transformed
[time=2022] and there is power for living because we have been born into a new and living hope that we have in
[time=2028] him first of all he's given us the power of a transformed life we see in that verse and then
[time=2034] verse five he goes on to say who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming
[time=2041] of that salvation he is telling us secondly that he has given us the power of his shield the power
[time=2048] of his protection we have power in our life of knowing that God is our protector and that he is
[time=2054] our spiritual shield and that he is watching out for us in our spiritual lives as we walk with him
[time=2060] daily oh he's given us great power he's promised us that power from his being and then a third
[time=2067] promise is found in our text this morning we've already talked about it it's in verse three his divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness that means he has given us
[time=2079] his enabling power to live a godly life now where does that power come from number one when we are
[time=2087] regenerated and born again we are filled by the power of his holy spirit we are a new creation we
[time=2093] are transformed he tells us in his word first of all it comes from the indwelling power of the holy
[time=2099] spirit secondly from the confidence and the power that we get from our new relationship with Jesus Christ knowing that Jesus lives within our hearts there's a close intimate relationship between ourselves and our Lord there's power for living that's found there and then he goes on to say that
[time=2115] we receive power from the hope that we have knowing that we have everlasting life there's a confidence
[time=2122] and a power for life that comes from that and then fourthly we have power through the sanctifying
[time=2128] power of his inerrant word the inerrant word of god as it impacts upon our life and as we implement
[time=2135] it into our life yes how do we get it we receive it from the promises of Jesus Christ when we come
[time=2142] to him in faith but moving along in verse four he tells us why he has given it to us why he's given
[time=2150] it to us he tells us in verse four through these things he has given us this very great and precious promises so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption
[time=2163] in the world caused by evil desires he has given us these powers that we might participate in the
[time=2169] divine nature now you might ask very very fairly what does that mean to participate in the divine
[time=2176] nature well let me first of all tell you what it doesn't mean that does not mean in any way that
[time=2182] we become deity it does not mean in any way that we become divine we never cease to be human there
[time=2189] are some within Christendom who are teaching today that when you receive the Holy Spirit you become divine just as Christ became divine they say at the time that the Holy Spirit came upon
[time=2199] him that's heresy that's error it's not truthful oh in no way do we become divine but then we must
[time=2207] ask the question what does it mean well we don't cease to be human but when we are born again we
[time=2213] come into a union with God and through the transforming power of his Holy Spirit we are a new creation
[time=2220] and as that Holy Spirit regenerates us and creates in us a new being he is telling us that we are
[time=2227] no longer spiritually dead but are spiritually alive and because of that new life we can have a
[time=2233] communion and a fellowship with God that we could never have before we had that faith in him
[time=2239] yes he has made us partakers of the divine nature we can share in the moral nature of God
[time=2246] or no longer dead we can commune we can fellowship with him he tells us that he's given us that he
[time=2253] wants us to have that transformed life we have new attitudes new want to's we've broken the bondage
[time=2260] of sin well notice as he goes on he says and also he has given us this power so we can escape the
[time=2267] corruption in the world caused by evil desires that word there escape means to flee to flee from
[time=2276] danger and he is saying here that we have been given this power in our life we have been given this sufficient power to face spiritual challenges because he wants us to escape from the moral
[time=2288] degradation of the world that we all live he wants us to escape from the sin and the corruption and the pollution and the filth of the world in which we live since i've given you this power that you
[time=2299] might do that that you might live a successful glorious christian life i've given you the power that that might be the case that you might have peace and contentment in eternal life you know
[time=2311] there are people looking for power and strength in many many different areas of the world today
[time=2318] there are people who are looking for everlasting life and they're looking for it in things such as
[time=2324] astrology they're looking for it in cults they're looking for it in drugs and alcohol they're looking
[time=2332] for strength to face their daily lives in the new age movement they're looking for strength
[time=2338] something that they can latch on to that they feel will give them more power for living all the bible teaches very plainly that christ is sufficient but the fact that people are seeking
[time=2349] something else seeking some other power i believe is the reason why brooks like diabetics by l ron
[time=2355] hubbert have sold millions of copies as people look for power for life i believe that's why brooks
[time=2362] by surely mcclean like dancing in the light have sold millions of copies because people are looking for some power that they can latch on to and the bible teaches the power is already there if you're
[time=2373] a believer just lay hold of it it's yours the new age movement has been growing i was i've told you
[time=2381] this story before but about a year ago i was wandering through a bookstore i like to do that i like to go back to the new age section in a bookstore i don't recommend you do that but i kind of like to see what the other side's doing right and about and i went back and i was looking through the books and i i found this book and it was called what sign is your pet and i thought hmm a book on new age raising of your pets by a new age veterinarian whatever that
[time=2407] is and as i was going through it it had some questions it has questions like this does she
[time=2414] lie down while she's eating she's a torus i don't know where they get that treat does he treat your
[time=2420] house like it's his castle he's a leo does she seem almost human in her ability to sense your
[time=2427] emotions she's a cancer does he blissfully ignore your commands and please he's not deaf he's an
[time=2435] aquarius i have two boys that must be an aquarius at home today well i don't have much time for
[time=2442] the new age movement i don't have much time for astrology i every once in a while have somebody ask me what sign i was born under i don't even like to tell them i just tell them i don't believe in that but sometimes they press you and they'll say you know what sign were you born under i always want to say texaco you know i don't know just something to kind of take them back a little bit
[time=2461] well the bible teaches that we don't have to look for any other power the power for living
[time=2468] is found in the person of jesus christ god is sufficient look no further if you're looking
[time=2475] today the power is here it's here today and then as we go along into the next verses verses five
[time=2482] to seven we see our second point today and that is the divine command the divine command he goes
[time=2490] on to say for this very reason make every effort to add to your faith goodness and to goodness
[time=2497] knowledge and to knowledge self-control and to self-control perseverance and to perseverance
[time=2503] godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love i've called the second
[time=2510] point that the the divine command because at the time that we are born again the bible teaches that we are given all of the spiritual resources that we need but spiritual growth and spiritual sanctification are not automatic in this life we can receive christ is our savior receive all of
[time=2526] these resources and not live up to being what he wants us to be unless we latch on and diligently
[time=2534] attempt to grow in our spiritual life he tells us in this verse that we are to add to our faith
[time=2541] what he is saying there is that faith is the beginning faith is the cornerstone faith is the seed bed coming to jesus christ in faith is the beginning and then it's the seed bed by which all of these other things grow out as we mature and grow in christ and peter is telling us here that
[time=2557] we must have an active part in our sanctification god gives us all the resources that we need to
[time=2563] mature and to grow but we must lay hold of them and we must make a diligent effort to grow in the
[time=2569] things of the faith he tells us in these verses that these are things we are to add as we exercise
[time=2577] our faith let's go through them this morning he says for this very reason make every effort to add to your faith goodness what's goodness well goodness is moral excellence goodness means to live
[time=2590] above reproach it's what the bible describes as moral excellence the ability to live a holy and
[time=2597] godly life it's a powerful word he says that we are to live a good life that means that we are
[time=2604] cultivating the qualities of god in our lives and not our own human qualities but the qualities that
[time=2611] we see in jesus christ we're cultivating a godly quality in our life we're living above reproach
[time=2618] and then notice he goes on next and he says that we are to grow in knowledge the type of knowledge
[time=2624] he's mentioning here is practical knowledge practical discernment and wisdom that we need for making
[time=2632] spiritual decisions as we live the christian life he is saying here that we need to have a practical
[time=2639] wisdom a practical wisdom that we bring to life and we approach life with that allows us to make
[time=2646] practical godly decisions now how do we get that wisdom i believe very clearly the bible
[time=2652] teaches that we need to ask for it number one james chapter one ask for that knowledge ask for that wisdom and then we need to immerse ourself in his word so that his word is there when we make the
[time=2663] spiritual decisions of life he tells us that we need to have goodness we need to have knowledge
[time=2670] we need to learn how to treat people how to handle problems properly and the wisdom is here it's in his word so he says that we are to grow and to continue to grow in goodness and in knowledge
[time=2682] and then in verse chapter or verse six he says and self-control now self-control here is a little
[time=2689] bit easy to misunderstand because the type of self-control that he is speaking of here is the type
[time=2695] of self-control that comes only when we are walking a spirit-filled life when we are yielding to the control of the holy spirit in our lives to be filled with self-control means that we have our desires
[time=2708] our lusts if you will under control it means that we don't let those internal desires and lusts
[time=2715] rule our life no we walk in a godly way and we walk in a way of self-control
[time=2722] and he tells us that we are to add that to our life we're not controlled by our lusts but we walk
[time=2728] the spirit-controlled life and then he goes on next and he says that we are to have perseverance
[time=2735] that means not giving up under adversity it means that we are to have spiritual strength it means that when the trials and tribulations of life come we don't quit we don't fail no we hold
[time=2746] on because of the strength that we've been given in Jesus Christ and Peter is saying cultivate that
[time=2752] perseverance help that perseverance to grow in your life oh the apostle Paul is the perfect example
[time=2759] of perseverance the perfect example of perseverance as the apostle Paul went through life
[time=2766] he faced tremendous trials and tribulations he was beaten he was stoned he was left for dead
[time=2772] he spent much of his life in prison but he never quit he persevered and he gives the secret of that
[time=2778] perseverance to us in the book of Philippians if you would for just a moment turn to Philippians chapter 4 Philippians chapter 4 and he tells us the secret of his perseverance verse 12
[time=2796] I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty I have learned the secret of
[time=2804] being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty
[time=2811] or living in want the apostle Paul there is saying I have gone through the trials and tribulations
[time=2817] of life I have gone through all of the terrible things that have happened to me I've been stoned I've been beaten I've been hit went and been flawed I've had all of those things happen but I've persevered I'm sitting here in this Roman jail right now but I'm persevering until the end
[time=2833] why because when those trials have come my way when those trials and tribulations have struck me I have rested in my faith in Jesus Christ and I have rested in his power and I have found that he's never let me down he's faithful and I'm going to persevere until the end
[time=2849] he says that we're to cultivate this type of perseverance in our life we're to have perseverance
[time=2856] and then notice next he says godliness I told you a few moments ago that that also means god likeness it means to walk in a godly way pursuing holiness in a sinful world
[time=2869] it means that the rudder that drives us is not the rudder of the world and the rudder of self it is the rudder of the Holy Spirit guiding us and directing us in our Christian life
[time=2880] and we can live a godlike way we can walk in holiness godliness and then in verses 7 he talks
[time=2888] about two types of love that he says we are to have he says and to godliness add brotherly kindness
[time=2895] this comes from a greek word that we're all familiar with it's the greek word fillejo it's where we get the name for that city in which we have in the United States called philadelphia and what's the slogan of the city of philadelphia it's known as the city of brotherly love
[time=2912] of brotherly kindness he's talking here about a love a special caring and love that we are to all have for our brothers and sisters in the faith it's the kind of love that we are supposed
[time=2923] to have for our brothers and sisters who have trusted in christ they are a part of this great kingdom of god and he is saying that we are to love them we are to care for them we are to meet their needs and reach out to them when they are in need or were to be there for them when they need us it's that bond of love that we have with a brother and a sister in the faith you know sometimes
[time=2944] that can be difficult to have because not everybody's as easy to love as somebody else and sometimes
[time=2950] we run up against a few characters you know in the christian life and they've come to christ and and they love him but sometimes their personality grates us the wrong way you know maybe it's us perhaps maybe it's them but the bible teaches we have to love them you've come across those people
[time=2965] haven't you you know how we do it as christians we sit around doing a very godly way we sit around discuss it and then we get done we say well I love him in the lord what we're really saying is you
[time=2976] know I really can't stand the guy but the bible says I gotta love him well the bible says we have to love our brothers and sisters in the lord but notice he doesn't stop there he goes on to talk about another type of love he says we need to love all men in verse seven to brotherly kindness
[time=2994] and love that's another greek word that you're familiar with it's the word agape it's the idea
[time=3000] of loving mankind in general and he is saying here that we are to love the world the way god
[time=3006] loves the world we are to love sinners the way god loves sinners and we are to reach out and do everything that we can to help our fellow man we are to have a passion for their soul we are to bring them into the faith in jesus christ we're to love them or to reach out to them
[time=3022] or to want what's good for them spiritually good what is he talking about here he's talking about
[time=3029] sanctification he's talking about growing in the faith and he is saying to us here that we are to
[time=3035] take what god has given us we are to take that power which he has given us and we are to grow in the faith we are to mature to the sanctifying process that god provides as we diligently apply
[time=3046] ourselves to his word and to prayer and to daily fellowship with him it's a command of god that
[time=3053] we grow it's a divine partnership that we have with him he provides the power we provide the
[time=3059] diligence and when you put the two together we can live the sacrificial sanctified godly life
[time=3066] coach bob timmons was watching a young high school sophomore run around the track at a high school
[time=3072] in kansas he was watching the man run and it was obvious the man had natural gifts and talents
[time=3079] long lanky legs that were powerful as they strided around the track tremendous lung capacity how after having only trained for a brief amount of time he was able
[time=3090] to leave all of the runners so far behind bob timmons watched as that young man crossed the finish line and he was astounded by the fact that his stopwatch said that 16 year old high school sophomore had run the mile in four minutes in 26 seconds and he realized that moment that he had a
[time=3108] potential world-class myler at his little high school in kansas and he couldn't believe his luck
[time=3114] he thought to himself i've got to have this young man and develop him in the field of track
[time=3120] well he went to young jim ryan and he told him jim i think you have the greatest ability i've ever seen as a high school sophomore before you graduate from high school jim you can break the
[time=3131] four minute mile i know you can well ryan writes in his book the quest for the gold that at first he
[time=3137] thought his coach was crazy but he says then he began to catch the vision to catch the fever
[time=3143] and he began to train like he never had before during the winter he was running 110 miles a week
[time=3149] each day he was running 40 four 40 yards sprints was just another 10 miles he said as he ran through
[time=3156] the hills and the countryside in the roads of kansas there were times when his nose and his mouth and his ears were frozen they were numb said there were days when he came home and he just fell into bed and that was his life school and track school and track and he just fell into bed at night
[time=3173] dragging himself out of bed in the morning but then in his senior year a track meet came and his
[time=3179] coach entered him into it it was called the Compton Invitational in los angeles california and young 18-year-old jim ryan went to that meet and there he stood with world-class milers the very best in the world all of which had broken the four minute mile many times in their
[time=3195] career he was overwhelmed as he stood at the starting line and as the gun went off he was jostled as he came into the start and as he tried to move out of the pack he was bumped and he lost his stride and he almost fell and he said he almost quit but something the coach timmons had
[time=3211] told him came back to him Jim never quit never quit get back in the race keep it up follow it
[time=3217] through and he got back in the race and he began to stride as he could with those powerful strides
[time=3223] and as the race went on he caught up with the pack and he didn't win that race he actually finished eighth but as he crossed the finish line feeling dejected for his eighth place finish he
[time=3235] looked up on the scoreboard and he saw Jim ryan three minutes 59 seconds he had become the first
[time=3244] high school miler to ever break the four minute mile why do i tell you that story well we all know
[time=3250] that Jim ryan went on to set the world's record that he went on to become an olympic champion but i tell you that story because it illustrates so well what god is saying through peter here today he's saying that god had given Jim ryan the gift of a wonderful body he had given him the power to
[time=3269] be a world-class miler but it was only through the diligence and the training as he kept himself
[time=3275] daily training that he was able to grow and achieve that goal it's not automatic and he is saying that we have the spiritual resources to live the christian life but we develop it and we grow in christ only when we diligently apply ourselves to the goal oh what a great truth he's given us
[time=3292] what a great truth well thirdly and lastly as we move on to verses eight and nine i want us to see
[time=3298] the divine desire the divine desire verses eight and nine for if you possess these qualities in
[time=3305] increasing measure what is the divine desire that we will possess these qualities mentioned above
[time=3312] that we will grow in sanctification if we will possess these qualities in increasing measure they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our lord jesus
[time=3323] christ the divine desire that we not be ineffective in our lives for jesus christ and how can we make
[time=3331] sure that we are not ineffective he's told us it's by cultivating all of these traits in our life
[time=3337] by growing up in sanctification by laying hold of the power that god has given us to face the trials and tribulations of life and he is saying you can make sure that you're not ineffective for
[time=3348] jesus christ it goes on in verse nine but if anyone does not have them if anyone does not apply himself
[time=3355] he is nearsighted and blind and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins
[time=3362] are we saying very clearly to us there that if we are not going to be ineffective if we are going
[time=3368] to be effective for him if our christianity is going to be contagious if our christianity is
[time=3374] going to be the type that wins souls if our christianity is going to be the type that gives a strong and clear testimony that is not compromised by our behavior he is saying that you must apply yourself
[time=3384] and grow and then it won't be ineffective we've enjoyed sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir and orchestra
