[time=0] It has been said that to air is human, but to blame it on the other guy is even more human.
[time=7] We have a natural tendency to want to blame our faults on another person.
[time=11] Today we're going to look at Ezekiel 18 and God's response to the nation of Israel as they cry, "Don't blame me."
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship.
[time=37] Thank you for joining us.
[time=39] In the absence of Pastor Moore, Pastor Tim Teder will be speaking today.
[time=43] His message is entitled, "Don't blame me." Are you tempted to blame the other guy when something is going wrong in your life?
[time=51] Is it always someone else's fault?
[time=53] Stay with us today as we study what God's word has to say about our personal responsibility.
[time=59] Have your Bibles open to Ezekiel 8.
[time=63] Before the message, we will be ministered to by solos from Lin Rol entitled, "The Promised Land."
[time=70] And from Kevin Rol entitled, "He Knows What to Do and He Knows When."
[time=77] Let's join our worship service as the sanctuary choir sings, "How Majestic is Your Name."
[time=89] [MUSIC]
[time=96] Oh Lord, oh Lord, how we're just in, is Your name in all the earth.
[time=111] Oh Lord, we praise Your name in all the earth.
[time=138] Oh Lord, oh Lord, how we're just in, is Your name in all the earth.
[time=151] Oh Lord, oh Lord, we praise Your name in all the earth.
[time=162] We thank You by Your name; it's how He is like in God.
[time=169] Oh Lord, how we're just in, is Your name.
[time=177] Praise to the Holy Almighty, the King of Peter.
[time=184] Oh Lord, how we're just in, is Your name.
[time=188] I call my soul praise to all the years, I help and salvation.
[time=199] I'll hear You hear me, I'll hear you listen, oh Lord, hear me.
[time=207] Oh Lord, how we're just in, is Your name in all the earth.
[time=231] Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out.
[time=246] Oh Lord, how we're just in, is Your name in all the earth.
[time=289] Oh Lord, how we're just in, is Your name.
[time=308] Let's continue worshiping in song as we turn to Him number 10.
[time=317] Sing about the great King that we serve today.
[time=320] Oh worship the King.
[time=322] We'll be singing verses 1, 2, and 4.
[time=325] Oh worship the King of the Lord, how so long, and great Lord is the King.
[time=340] Sing about the great King of the Lord, how we're just in, is Your name in all the earth.
[time=360] Oh tell of His high offering of His grace, oh for His high, earth and of His faith,
[time=374] His presence of remedy, under control, and our Jesus has come away from the storm.
[time=392] Hail to the Red of the halls, and King of the Red of the land, in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[time=407] By the grace of heaven, our worthy land, our worthy land of the Red of the land.
[time=432] And that's great singing, being administered to Now in Music by Len Rol.
[time=462] Give and let shade in the Promised Land.
[time=468] Crystal waters flow like wine, I understand, I'm going there, going there.
[time=481] I hear the skies set fire blue in the Promised Land.
[time=488] And rain will never cloud the view in the Promised Land.
[time=495] And Jesus rules His Lord of all that God's right hand, I'm going there, going there.
[time=507] Oh I want to go, where the milk and honey flow, where Jesus is the light, where He's building me a home.
[time=522] Oh I want to be, where my father waits for me, longing for the day I finally stand in the Promised Land.
[time=542] I hear the days are timeless, they're in the Promised Land.
[time=550] And heartache doesn't have a prayer in the Promised Land.
[time=557] And praises of our God, our Son, I have remained, I'm going there, going there.
[time=570] Oh I want to go, where the milk and honey flow, where Jesus is the light, where He's building me a home.
[time=585] Oh I want to be, where my father waits for me, longing for the day I finally stand in the Promised Land.
[time=606] No need to take a Varro, nothing else to bring a love, in a land where there's no tomorrow.
[time=617] Cause today is forever alone.
[time=623] I want to go, where the milk and honey flow, where Jesus is the light, where He's building me a home.
[time=635] Oh I want to be, where my father waits for me, longing for the day I finally stand in the Promised Land.
[time=657] No need to take a Varro, nothing else to bring a love, in a land where there's no tomorrow.
[time=668] Cause today is forever alone.
[time=675] I want to go, where the milk and honey flow, where Jesus is the light, where He's building me a home.
[time=687] Oh I want to be, where my father waits for me, longing for the day I finally stand in the Promised Land.
[time=704] In the Promised Land, in the Promised Land.
[time=719] Hello and welcome today to the Bible Hour.
[time=727] Our pastor Russ Moore has gone on vacation as is Pete Coby and they should be back next week.
[time=732] But I want to welcome you today. Thank you for joining us.
[time=736] It's my privilege to be able to work at Blackhawk Baptist Church in the youth ministry, work with junior and senior hires.
[time=743] I thought it would be good if I could take the opportunity today to introduce you to a couple of the students that have been involved in turn point youth ministries, the youth ministry of our church, over the past years.
[time=753] I'd like to introduce them to you now. We have Josh Rang and Katina Jones.
[time=757] Both of them are seniors, graduated this past year and soon are going to be leaving the youth ministry of our church to go on to school.
[time=766] Josh and Katina, thanks for being here this morning.
[time=770] Maybe you could tell the people, first of all, a little bit about what it's meant for you to be involved in the youth ministry at turn point.
[time=779] What kind of things have you been involved in, Josh?
[time=783] It's been really fun. One major thing that I've done that I've really enjoyed is I've been a youth sponsor for the junior high and that's been fun going on events with them, going to Cedar Point with them and camping and everything like that and just getting involved with them.
[time=797] That's a lot of fun because then at school and wherever you see them they always just bump into you and say hi and then you get that friendship going with them and that's really fun to see them grow and everything.
[time=807] And then also with the senior high, I can't do as much as I'd like to because I'm with the junior high but the senior high events are great too, going rafting and stuff like that, so it's been great.
[time=818] Good. Katina?
[time=820] For me it's probably been like servant team, just getting to know the Bible more and being more comfortable with that, praying with friends.
[time=827] I've gone on Operation Outreach the past three years, going to Florida and spreading the gospel, telling people the truth about Jesus Christ.
[time=834] And that's really been helpful to me being from a public high school, you know, being able to be more comfortable with my friends and witnessing to them.
[time=841] I know there'd be a number of students that would say, you know, when I get into high school I'm just too busy to be involved in one other thing.
[time=849] I've got school, I've got work, but you both have been fairly involved in our youth ministry in a lot of different aspects.
[time=856] What would you say has been the difference being involved in a youth ministry, being involved in a church, what differences that made in your life?
[time=864] Well, like for me, the friends that I've made here just been great, you know, being from a public high school out of Fort Wayne, they were very open to me and, you know, there's a special bond between the friends I have here than what I have in my own high school.
[time=878] They're always there encouraging me in my walk with Christ and someone for me to follow, both the sponsors here and the people, the students here.
[time=887] And as far as like the Bible background and stuff, I didn't have that in high school, you know, as far as a Bible class to go to every day and learn.
[time=894] But the turn point itself has helped me to have a Bible basic background that I can take with me as I go to a state university in the fall.
[time=902] Great. Josh? As Katina said, like friends are great. I don't know where I'd be without all of them encouraging me and showing me things to do and everything like that.
[time=913] But also another neat thing is how a lot of the people in the church just get behind the youth and everything.
[time=920] And then the older people, when you see them in the halls and everything, they talk to you and find out how your events went and everything like that.
[time=927] And it's just really fun and neat and good to know that other people, older people are interested in your lives.
[time=934] And that kind of encourages you to help you think, man, you know, when I get older, I want to help people too and encourage them and everything like that.
[time=942] That's great. I just want both of you to know that I have been encouraged to watch your lives to see you involved in our ministry here at Church.
[time=953] And I know that other students, underclassmen and people in your own class, have been affected as they've seen the reality of Jesus Christ in your lives.
[time=961] If you'd like to know more about the youth ministry of our church, especially if you're local to the Fort Wayne area, you can call our youth offices.
[time=970] And the number is area code 2197491909, and that dials you into our hotline, which gives you the current information of events that are coming up.
[time=980] In fact, we'd like to hear from you, if you're a Bible hour viewer, whether you're interested in the youth ministry or other aspects of our church program, or just let us know how the ministry of the Bible hour has impacted your life.
[time=992] We invite you to write us. You can write us at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1003] And if you would write us, we'd like to send you a free gift. It's a booklet called "God's Answers for Your Life."
[time=1010] This book contains God's answers from Scripture to topics such as beginning in Christ, your life growing in Christ, maturing in Christ, ministering in Christ, uniting in Christ, all aspects of the Christian life are contained in this book.
[time=1024] And if you'd write us, we'd like to send this to you. Once again, the address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1038] Let's return now to our regular service as we listen to the ministry of singing by Kevin Rowe.
[time=1052] He knows what to do and he knows when. Sometimes when the nights get long and you question where he's been, sometimes we forget that God does all things for our good.
[time=1076] He knows what to do and he knows when. Jesus feels the pain that you've gone.
[time=1089] He knows the things that mean the most to you. He knows how to heal the hurt that's wounded you within.
[time=1108] He knows what to do and he knows when. He knows what to do and he knows when.
[time=1126] Sometimes when the nights get long and you question where he's been, sometimes we forget that God does all things for our good.
[time=1142] He knows what to do and he knows when. When the circumstances change and you cannot understand, just remember God knows where you are for his place to in his hands.
[time=1169] He knows what to do and he knows when.
[time=1192] Sometimes when the nights get long and you question where he's been, sometimes we forget that God does all things for our good.
[time=1212] He knows what to do and he knows what to do and he knows when.
[time=1242] Thank you Kevin. I'm so thankful that I trust in a sovereign God who knows the right thing to do, knows when's the right time to do it and is able to do it.
[time=1256] I'm so thankful I'd be in much despair and hopelessness I think and a lot of experiences of life if I didn't have that trust.
[time=1264] God's a sovereign God. He's provident. We can believe that to be true.
[time=1276] You may not be as familiar with Ezekiel as you are with other Old Testament books.
[time=1281] Daniel, we hear more stories from the book of Daniel. The lion's den is always good. The fiery furnace, the visions.
[time=1289] Ezekiel was a contemporary of Daniel. If you remember, Daniel was taken captivity to Babylon. He was one of the Israelites taken as an exile to Babylon.
[time=1301] Later when King Nebuchadnezzar went back to Jerusalem to subdue and uprising against him, he took more of the leaders and significant people.
[time=1310] More of the Israelites back to Babylon. Ezekiel was one of those. Ezekiel was raised in the family of a priest and God raised him to be a priest prophet to those Israelites who were away from their home in a foreign land, those who were in exile.
[time=1331] And as to those people that God's speaking through Ezekiel addresses in the 18th chapter. Let's read the first couple verses.
[time=1341] The word of the Lord came to me. What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel? And here's the proverb they were quoting.
[time=1351] The fathers eat sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.
[time=1356] Now apparently this is a fairly well known proverb. Jeremiah mentions it too as something that was being quoted by the people.
[time=1363] And God says, what do you mean by saying this? The fathers eat sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.
[time=1372] You know, we as people have a tendency to want to blame others for our own wrongdoing. It started way back.
[time=1379] Adam and Eve. When they disobeyed God and God came to them, Adam said, "Dad, Adam said, "Dad, don't blame me. It's her fault."
[time=1386] And Eve said, "God, don't blame me. It's the serpent's fault. We always want to blame somebody else." In fact, one person said, "It's part of our humanity to air as human and to blame someone else for it is even more human."
[time=1399] We have the example. Have you ever watched People's Court, Judge Watner? You know, it used to be one of my favorite shows I loved.
[time=1407] In the afternoon, 5.30, I'd get around TV and watch Judge Watner, People's Court.
[time=1411] You know, you watch people come to the court and they're always blaming each other.
[time=1414] No one ever says, "Judge Watner, you're right. I'm to blame." You know, just put it all on me.
[time=1419] No, they're coming to court because they want it. We always want to blame somebody else for our own wrongdoing.
[time=1425] It happens in the church, too. You know, old Brother Biddley's in some kind of trouble.
[time=1431] And we come to church and Brother Biddley's standing over against the wall and he's smiling.
[time=1435] Now, we know he's in trouble, but he's smiling and we think, "Well, isn't that a blessing, Brother Biddley?" You know, he's finding joy in the midst of his trial, tribulation.
[time=1443] When actually Brother Biddley's over there, he's in trouble and he's smiling because he just thought of someone else he can blame it on.
[time=1448] You know, we always want to blame on somebody else.
[time=1452] If you have children, you know that's true. We were going to your children and said, "Hey, what's the problem here?" They're always blaming each other. I go into my kid's room and they're supposed to be neat and there's this junk laying all over the floor.
[time=1463] I said, "Okay, who got this stuff out?" And, you know, Jared is saying, "Well, it was Caleb. He did it."
[time=1470] Caleb said, "No, Kara did it. Kara says, "No, it's the boys. They did it." You know, and pretty soon, Rochelle will be old enough. She'll be in that whole circle and cycle of things, too.
[time=1477] They blame each other. You know, kids, it's this kind of thing.
[time=1480] It's not me. It's someone else's fault.
[time=1483] What happens when we want to blame other people?
[time=1486] We don't want to accept responsibility for our own wrongdoing. We want to pass the buck.
[time=1491] We end up telling a lie. And that's what the people were doing and quoting this proverb.
[time=1494] They were saying something that wasn't true and it was an offense to God.
[time=1498] The fathers eat sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.
[time=1501] You're eating a sour grape.
[time=1503] Ever popped one of those babies in your mouth and that thing was just really bad.
[time=1507] You know, your lips kind of go funny and it does all those things.
[time=1510] Usually, for me, it's the last grape on the bunch.
[time=1513] You know, I'll finish the whole thing and it's so good and I'll pop that last one in there and it just leaves that sour taste in your mouth.
[time=1518] Well, here are the people who are saying, you know, something that was really ridiculous.
[time=1522] You know, our fathers eat the sour grapes and it's affecting us.
[time=1525] Our teeth are set on edge. That would be kind of comical if you could really do that.
[time=1529] You know, whatever you ate was affecting your kids, you know, and you eat the lemon there standing in the corner, puckering up.
[time=1534] The kids, that's what these people were saying.
[time=1536] You know, they were saying, God, it was our parents.
[time=1540] Our parents were disobedient to you, but you're blaming us for it and you're judging us for our parents wrong doing.
[time=1548] And that was a lie. It wasn't true.
[time=1551] If it was true and if they believed it, then it would lead to a sense of fatalism.
[time=1557] You know, what does it matter what I do if God's going to judge me for something that I didn't do?
[time=1561] It would lead to a sense of irresponsibility, which it did in these people.
[time=1565] We're not responsible for what we've done. It's their fault.
[time=1569] Bitterness towards God. All those things are true of these people.
[time=1573] But it's a lie. God says this isn't true.
[time=1577] Now, as with most lies, it has an element of truth in it.
[time=1580] And so does this lie have an element of truth because it is true that the sin of one person can cause another to be affected.
[time=1588] Isn't that true? The sin of one person can cause another to be affected.
[time=1592] Let's just look at some examples of that.
[time=1594] Turning back near the beginning of the Old Testament book of Exodus, the second book of the Bible.
[time=1599] Exodus chapter 20, God giving the Decalogue, the big 10.
[time=1603] God giving those 10 commandments that he inscribed on stone, and he's giving them here.
[time=1610] It would be beginning at verse 4, we read of Exodus 20.
[time=1614] You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
[time=1622] You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I, the Lord your God, and the jealous God, and listen to this.
[time=1628] I'm a jealous God of punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.
[time=1638] Now what's that saying? Is it saying that if a parent, if a father sins that God is going to be upset and he's not going to only punish that father,
[time=1647] but he's going to punish that father's children and the grandchildren and the great grandchildren for the sin of the father?
[time=1653] No, that's not what God is saying. You study it carefully in parallel passages and in numbers and in Deuteronomy.
[time=1659] God is realizing the sin of the fathers will most likely be passed on to the children and the next generation and the next,
[time=1669] and as long as that's passed on, and each generation hates God, because that's what he says, I pass judgment to those who continue to hate me.
[time=1676] As the effects of the father's sin continue in the rebellion of his children and his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren,
[time=1683] God continues to show judgment and bring judgment, but the fact is in God realize that the sin of some is going to have an effect on others.
[time=1691] We turn over to the book in Numbers and we have the picture of God leading his people to the Promised Land,
[time=1699] and they're outside the Promised Land. They send the spies in, twelve spies, ten of them come back and say there's no way.
[time=1706] People are too big, opposition is too great, we can't do it.
[time=1711] Only two, Joshua and Caleb said, yes we can, we can go in and take it.
[time=1714] But because of the complaining and the rebellion of the people and not believing God, God judges them and says you're going to wander in the wilderness.
[time=1721] And tell those of you of a certain age die off, you're going to wander.
[time=1725] Your children will be the one that go in, but I want to tell you something, your children are going to live as shepherds because of your disobedience.
[time=1733] For forty years they're going to have to live as shepherds in the wilderness because of your disobedience.
[time=1738] So there is the truth that the sin of some can cause an effect in other people's lives.
[time=1746] The people that were on the boat with Jonah knew that.
[time=1749] I mean, they'd gotten on a cruise, you know, a little Mediterranean tour.
[time=1753] They paid their money and all of a sudden this storm, a judgment from God, comes against the boat threatening to kill them.
[time=1761] Why? Because Jonah was on the boat and God was after Jonah, but they felt the effects of it.
[time=1767] So it is true that the sin of one person can cause another to be affected, but this is not true.
[time=1774] The sin of one person can cause another to be judged. No.
[time=1782] In fact, God forbade that to happen.
[time=1785] God did not allow one person's sin to be judgment for another person.
[time=1790] Deuteronomy 24-16, God says, "Father shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers, each is to die for his own sin."
[time=1801] See, the people were taking something that they understood from the law and from experience to be true, that their sin has an effect even on further generations.
[time=1809] But they were taking it farther and saying, "God, we're innocent.
[time=1812] You're just judging us for the wrong doing of our parents. We don't deserve this.
[time=1817] Don't blame us, God. You should have taken it all out on them." And God says that simply isn't true.
[time=1823] In fact, when you read the rest of Ezekiel things he's written before and after this passage, you find the people were not only as bad as their parents, but they were worse.
[time=1831] But they were saying this lie, this proverb.
[time=1834] God goes on in Ezekiel 18, verse 3, "As surely as I live, declares the sovereign Lord, you will no longer quote this proverb in Israel.
[time=1841] For every living soul belongs to me, the Father as well as the Son, both alike belong to me, the soul who sins is the one who will die."
[time=1850] Now, a couple of things here. First of all, God is sovereign. He gives that title of himself to the people, "I the sovereign Lord."
[time=1860] And one of his rights as sovereign Lord is the right to my life and your life in every other person's life.
[time=1866] He says that every living soul belongs to me.
[time=1871] I spoke with a student during the summer who is not a Christian, never trusted in Christ, and was very open about it.
[time=1879] As we talk, the student said to me, you know, Tim, sometimes, even though I admit that I've never trusted and there's a lot of things I struggle with and don't really believe,
[time=1889] there are times when I walk out, especially at night, look up in the sky, and I see everything that's there.
[time=1896] And I just believe that there must be a creator. And when I think that, it scares me.
[time=1901] Well, you know, that's a proper response to realize that there's a creator to whom we may give an account someday.
[time=1907] And God says, "Yes, I am the sovereign Lord. I am the sovereign Lord. I have the right to every life." And he says, "It's the soul that sins that will die." Now, a couple of things we should understand.
[time=1918] The Hebrew people, when they heard this being said, probably thought of it a little differently than you understand it as we read that verse today.
[time=1928] Because we interpret things from a New Testament perspective. So when I say soul, what do you think of?
[time=1933] You know, you probably think of a disembodied spirit of each person that someday will appear before God.
[time=1939] So the Hebrew person, the soul, wasn't just a disembodied spirit. It was the life of a person.
[time=1943] It was the physical and the non-physical altogether.
[time=1946] And when we talk about dying, you shall surely die. What it pops into our mind is, well, it's talking about eternal death.
[time=1953] But to the Hebrew person, there was not so much thinking about eternal death or life.
[time=1958] It was what God was doing here and now. You know, God promised the land, life, blessing, prosperity, or God promises death and judgment.
[time=1968] So although the truth of eternal life and death may be contained in some of the things that are being said here,
[time=1976] what the people were hearing and understanding is what God is dealing with us now. How is He dealing with us?
[time=1981] And God said, you know, the judgment that you face, you're not facing judgment for someone else's sin.
[time=1987] That is never true. That is never true. In fact, He goes on to give an example of this by telling the story of a father, of a son, and of a grandson.
[time=1997] We'll just go through it quickly beginning in verse 5.
[time=2001] Suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right. Here's the father.
[time=2007] And it goes on to describe the things that he does in obedience to God.
[time=2010] He does not eat in the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel.
[time=2015] He does not defile his neighbor's wife or lie with a woman during her period, which was forbidden in the law of Moses.
[time=2021] He does not oppress anyone, but returns what he took and pledged for a loan. He does not commit robbery, but he gives his food to the hungry.
[time=2027] He provides clothing for the naked. He does not lend at usury or take excessive interest.
[time=2031] You know the Israelites weren't allowed to charge interest to one another.
[time=2034] If you loan money to another person, God's family, they weren't there forbidden from charging interest on that loan in a personal, private loan to one another.
[time=2042] This person didn't do it. He withholds his hand from doing wrong. He judges fairly between man and man.
[time=2046] He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous. He will surely what? He will live, said the sovereign Lord.
[time=2053] So here's the father who lives a righteous life. What's the outcome of that? He lives.
[time=2058] Now that father has a son, verse 10, suppose he has a violent son who sheds blood or does any of these other things.
[time=2064] It goes on to describe the son of the father who doesn't follow the righteous ways of his father, but goes on and does his own thing in disobedience to God.
[time=2073] So we have a righteous father. We have a wicked son. And what's the outcome of the wicked son? End of verse 13.
[time=2078] With such a man live, he will not. Because he has done all these detestable things, he will surely be put to death, and his blood will be on his own head.
[time=2087] Then that father has a son. So the grandson, the grandson looking back, knows the testimony example of his grandfather living righteously.
[time=2097] He knows the example of his father who lived wickedly, and God said the outcome of that would be death, and now this grandson makes a choice.
[time=2107] Verse 14, "But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins of his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things.
[time=2115] But he lives righteously and it goes on to describe his life." Now what will his outcome be?
[time=2120] Verse 17, "He will not die for his father's sin. He will surely live." Now what's the point of all this?
[time=2126] God is just telling the people that it's not what your father, what your parent has done, you are responsible for your own life.
[time=2135] So don't try to pass the blame. You will be judged for your own righteousness or sinfulness, not for the righteousness or sinfulness of other people.
[time=2147] He summarizes it in verse 20, "The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son.
[time=2157] The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked man will be charged against him."
[time=2164] That's just a few observations here.
[time=2168] Just restate what we've already said. The reward of a righteous lifestyle is what? Is life.
[time=2177] The reward of a righteous lifestyle is life. God tells the people.
[time=2181] The consequence of a wicked lifestyle or disobedience, a sinful lifestyle is what? It's death.
[time=2188] The consequence of disobedience of a sinful lifestyle is death.
[time=2193] God goes on to say that each person bears the responsibility for his or her own action.
[time=2199] He says in verse 20 that a child is not responsible for the action of the parents, for the way a parent chooses to live.
[time=2210] I'm not guilty for what my parents have done.
[time=2214] There are some people who suffer that sense of guilt because of what parents have done.
[time=2221] Sometimes you see it in the case of divorce where a child comes in and talking about that and you realize that they feel that they're somehow they're guilty.
[time=2228] They're responsible.
[time=2230] Even sometimes in the case of physical abuse or sexual abuse, in the case of a child will come in and think somehow they brought it all on themselves.
[time=2239] They are responsible.
[time=2242] The child is not responsible for the guilt, the disobedient of a parent, and neither listen to this parent's, neither is a parent responsible for the disobedience of the child.
[time=2252] They say, "Wait a minute. I thought parents were responsible."
[time=2258] Not responsible for the actions of your child or your child's way of life.
[time=2263] As a parent, what am I responsible for?
[time=2266] Am I responsible to teach my children the truth? Yes.
[time=2269] Does God hold me accountable to that? Yes, he does.
[time=2272] Am I responsible to discipline my children? Yes, I am.
[time=2277] Am I responsible not only to teach them what's right but to live that in integrity before my children so they see Christ living out of my life?
[time=2285] Am I responsible for that? Yes.
[time=2287] And if I don't do that, that's going to have an effect on my children.
[time=2292] And if I don't do those things, my children may have a tendency to be more rebellious.
[time=2296] In fact, I think that's what the proverb is saying, that if we train up a child the way he should go when he's old, he will not depart from that way.
[time=2302] But it's a proverb.
[time=2304] The proverb is the principle of life. It's not necessarily an absolute.
[time=2307] There are times, parents, there are times when a parent does what they can in rightness before God.
[time=2314] They want to live the right kind of life, they want to be the right kind of parent before God, and none of us are perfect.
[time=2319] But doing the best they can, living right before God, trying to instill that into the life of their children, taking responsibility for the life of that child when they're making the choices for that child.
[time=2328] And there's a period of life where, as a parent, I'm responsible for the choices in my child's life, but there comes a time when they make their own choices.
[time=2335] And when that comes, even sometimes in the best of families, there are children who rebel and turn against God.
[time=2340] What God is saying here is, parent, you're responsible for your own sin, your children are responsible for theirs.
[time=2346] I need to be careful as a parent that I don't somehow try to take the guilt of a child and try to instill that into my own life.
[time=2355] I'm responsible for what I do as a parent right or wrong. God will hold me accountable to that.
[time=2361] My children are responsible for some day the choices they begin making on their own.
[time=2366] We are responsible for our own actions, verses 26 and 27.
[time=2375] We can change.
[time=2377] If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin, he will die for it.
[time=2382] Because of the sin he has committed, he will die.
[time=2385] But if a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will save his life.
[time=2392] Now here's a principle that I believe to be true.
[time=2396] The direction of a person's life leads to its proper conclusion.
[time=2408] If the direction of a person's life is sinfulness, rebellion, doing my own thing instead of what God wants me to do,
[time=2416] then the outcome, the conclusion of that, is death, is judgment.
[time=2420] If the direction of my life is one of obedience and love for God, then the conclusion, the destiny of that life is one of life.
[time=2430] I know some people just look at this and say, "Now this is Old Testament, right?" I mean, this doesn't really apply to us in that sense because this is Old Testament talking here.
[time=2438] I mean, you make it sound like living the right way has something to do with how God accepts us.
[time=2443] That's Old Testament talk.
[time=2445] I mean, in the Old Testament, they live by the law, but we live by faith.
[time=2450] In the Old Testament, they were saved by their works, but were saved by grace.
[time=2455] Sometimes I hate the wall we put between Old and New Testament because we misunderstand that so easily.
[time=2462] I mean, sometimes I really think that we believe in the Old Testament somehow they were acceptable before God simply by doing,
[time=2468] obeying the commands and doing the right things, and that's all God required.
[time=2471] If you obey these commands, then you're one of my children.
[time=2475] And when Jesus came on the scene, he said, "Well, the law is over with. I'm abolishing the law.
[time=2481] Now you're acceptable to God simply by having faith, trusting in me."
[time=2487] But the Bible is very clear that salvation has been by faith from beginning to end.
[time=2494] Old Testament and New, salvation is always by faith.
[time=2499] Old Testament and New Testament.
[time=2500] So this isn't just an Old Testament principle, it's New Testament too.
[time=2504] If you want to keep your finger in Ezekiel 18, flip over to Romans first chapter.
[time=2511] I mean, just let me help you.
[time=2512] I think this is misunderstood.
[time=2514] I talked to Christian here.
[time=2516] We spend so much time in the New Testament because we don't think the Old Testament applies to us that much anymore.
[time=2521] God, certainly there's a difference in the way God dealt with Israel in the Old Testament.
[time=2526] And what all the law meant.
[time=2529] But if we begin to think, well, none of that applies today.
[time=2531] We've misunderstood.
[time=2533] Salvation has always been by faith.
[time=2536] And that's the point Paul's making is he talks about Romans.
[time=2539] Let me just look at a couple of the passages here.
[time=2542] Romans chapter 1 verses 16 and 17.
[time=2545] Paul says, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it's the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.
[time=2550] First for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
[time=2552] For in the gospel the righteousness from God has revealed a righteousness that is by faith from first to last.
[time=2559] Just as it is written, and he quotes an Old Testament verse here, the righteous will live by faith."
[time=2566] Now, what's Paul talking about?
[time=2567] He's talking about the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2569] But he's talking about a gospel that brings about a righteousness that has always been by faith from first to last.
[time=2576] And he quotes an Old Testament.
[time=2578] And you see, the point that Paul's going to make is here faith has, righteousness has always been by faith.
[time=2585] He goes on in chapter 4 of Romans.
[time=2590] What then shall we say that Abraham or our forefather discovered in this manner?
[time=2596] If in fact Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God.
[time=2600] What does the Scriptures say?
[time=2601] And again, he quotes an Old Testament passage.
[time=2604] Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[time=2608] His faith is what mattered.
[time=2611] You can read that whole chapter and that's what he's talking about.
[time=2614] Look over in verse 13 of chapter 4.
[time=2616] It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.
[time=2625] You see, the observance of the law could never save anyone, Old Testament or New.
[time=2630] The law was given to those people who were trusting in God to be that which lived out.
[time=2637] They lived out in obedience and service to God.
[time=2640] And at foreshadowed what was going to come.
[time=2643] See, salvation was always through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=2647] Observing the law in the Old Testament couldn't save anyone.
[time=2649] It couldn't forgive sin.
[time=2650] Only the death of Jesus Christ could do that.
[time=2652] But the sacrifices and the ceremonies and everything they observed pointed towards that.
[time=2656] They were trusting ahead in the salvation God was going to bring.
[time=2660] We look back and trust in what God has already provided through Jesus Christ.
[time=2664] But it's been from faith.
[time=2666] It's been by faith from first to last.
[time=2669] The law can't save.
[time=2672] Hebrews 10 makes that clear.
[time=2674] The first few verses of Hebrews 10 when it says the law is just a shadow of what was to come.
[time=2679] And it goes on to say that the blood of the goats and the bulls couldn't forgive one single sin.
[time=2684] Only the blood of Jesus Christ could do that.
[time=2687] So by faith the people were trusting in the provision of God and the Messiah that was going to come as much as they understood about that.
[time=2693] By faith they believed and by faith they lived out in obedience the observance of the law that foreshadowed that foretold that was a symbol of what was going to come.
[time=2700] Jesus came and fulfilled the law.
[time=2703] Jesus never says the law is bad.
[time=2706] Jesus says I've just come and I've fulfilled the law.
[time=2708] There's no need for you to follow those things anymore.
[time=2710] They've all pointed to me.
[time=2711] I've been here.
[time=2712] I've fulfilled everything.
[time=2713] Now you go.
[time=2714] Salvation by faith.
[time=2715] We release.
[time=2716] We're freed from the law.
[time=2717] We live in freedom.
[time=2719] Salvation has always been through faith.
[time=2721] That's what David I think understood when he was praying to God in his prayer of repentance Psalm 51.
[time=2727] He said God you don't desire the sacrifices that I would bring.
[time=2730] That's not what you want.
[time=2731] The sacrifice you desire God is a broken and a contrite heart.
[time=2734] And through the prophets over and over in the Old Testament God makes it very clear that he doesn't want sacrifices
[time=2740] and burnt offerings that come from hearts that are not devoted to God.
[time=2746] He says those trying to obey the law when you're not don't have a devotion or love for me is detestable to me.
[time=2752] So I'm just trying to explain that this isn't just an Old Testament principle.
[time=2756] It's something that's true in the Old Testament and knew that the direction of a person's life leads to its proper conclusion.
[time=2762] And you say no in the New Testament that's not true Tim.
[time=2765] You know in the New Testament it's just you know you have faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2768] It doesn't matter how you live.
[time=2771] It's just simply by believing and trusting in Jesus Christ then you're saved.
[time=2774] But it's the same in the New Testament.
[time=2779] Out of a heart that's devoted to God comes a life of obedience.
[time=2782] And the life of obedience gives evidence of the true faith.
[time=2785] Pastor Moore has been talking about that the last couple of Sundays that he's spoken.
[time=2790] And we have the same principle since Ezekiel 18 repeated in the New Testament.
[time=2794] The direction of a person's life leads to its proper conclusion.
[time=2796] What does Jesus say in Matthew 25 when he says that people the nations are going to stand before him someday and he will begin the separation?
[time=2803] The goats on one hand, the sheep on the other.
[time=2806] And how does he separate them?
[time=2811] By the things that they've done by the direction of their life.
[time=2818] Were they helpful to those who had need?
[time=2820] They have concern for others?
[time=2822] Did they demonstrate that?
[time=2823] Was the direction of their life?
[time=2826] The direction of their life led to the proper conclusion.
[time=2828] See I believe Galatians chapter 6 verses 7 and 8 is a parallel to what we've been learning in Ezekiel 18.
[time=2834] "Don't be deceived," we're told.
[time=2836] God cannot be mocked.
[time=2837] A man reaps what he sows.
[time=2839] This is New Testament.
[time=2840] The one who sows to please his sinful nature from that nature will reap destruction.
[time=2846] The one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life.
[time=2851] It's true.
[time=2852] The direction of a person's life leads to its proper conclusion.
[time=2855] You say, are you saying then that I'm saved by the kind of life?
[time=2860] I leave a good life that means I'm saved?
[time=2862] No, please understand.
[time=2863] We repeat over and over and over again that that's not true.
[time=2866] That we are saved by faith in God, but the reality is that true faith, a changed heart, results in a changed life.
[time=2875] That's right.
[time=2877] An Old Testament are new.
[time=2879] You will find the principle that the direction of a person's life leads to its proper conclusion.
[time=2884] It's interesting even the New Testament when you look at the judgment of God tied to that almost always is the works of an individual that's going to be judged.
[time=2893] Sometimes we get the idea that all it means is we're going to stand before God someday.
[time=2897] He's going to open a book, see if our name's there, and oh yep, your name's the Lamb's Book of Life.
[time=2901] You can pass into heaven.
[time=2903] Well, that's true.
[time=2905] If Christ has forgiven me, there's no way I can earn my salvation.
[time=2908] And if God has put the seal of His Holy Spirit in my life, then I am sealed.
[time=2912] I am bound. Nothing can take that away from me, and that's all that's required.
[time=2915] I will stand in the righteousness of Jesus Christ when I stand before God, everything forgiven.
[time=2919] And yet, Scripture is very clear that the evidence of my life will show that God that Christ has been real in me, that I truly have belonged to God.
[time=2927] And it's inconsistent for me to stand before God one day and say, yes, my life has been changed, and yet the pattern of my life has been in wickedness and disobedience to God.
[time=2935] There's not consistency there.
[time=2937] The direction of a person's life leads to its proper conclusion.
[time=2942] That's what God's telling him in Ezekiel 18.
[time=2944] But see the hope, the promise, and the positive aspect of all of this in Ezekiel 18 is that a person can change.
[time=2952] The direction of their life can change.
[time=2954] Things can be different. How? v. 30 and 31.
[time=2957] Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you.
[time=2960] Each one, according to his ways, declares the sovereign Lord.
[time=2965] Repent.
[time=2966] Turn away from all your offenses, then sin will not be your downfall.
[time=2971] Read yourselves of all the offenses you have committed and get a new heart and a new spirit.
[time=2981] How does a person change the direction of life and what's God calling the people of Israel to do here?
[time=2986] First of all, he tells them accept responsibility for your own life.
[time=2990] Turn away from all your offenses, then sin will not be your downfall.
[time=2995] Quit blaming someone else. Quit yelling. Don't blame me.
[time=3000] Accept responsibility for your own life.
[time=3002] And you know, I believe these same things are true for us.
[time=3005] How do we change the direction of our life?
[time=3009] That's a way from God. How do we change?
[time=3012] First of all, I think in our understanding and our thinking, we have to believe the truth that I am responsible for the sin in my life.
[time=3019] No one else is to blame. I am responsible.
[time=3021] I've got to stop blaming other people.
[time=3023] Someone says, "Well, I come from a broken home." You know, that's had great effect on me.
[time=3029] All the stuff I went through, perhaps I was abused as a child.
[time=3034] You know, that's real.
[time=3036] And that people that go through those experiences have to deal with that in a different way than I deal with my life having never gone through those things.
[time=3044] There may be things that a person that's come from a broken home or an abusive situation has to struggle with and deal with that I don't have to, but you understand this folks, it's never an excuse for disobedience and sin.
[time=3054] It never is an excuse for disobedience and sin.
[time=3058] Someone says, "Well, you don't understand how I've been used by my husband and wife."
[time=3067] They've misused my trust.
[time=3070] They've walked out on me.
[time=3072] They're not fulfilling my needs.
[time=3075] So this bitterness in my heart isn't my fault, you can blame them.
[time=3079] And the fact that I'm going out trying to find some sort of compassion and content in another relationship with someone I'm not married to, that's not my fault, it's theirs.
[time=3088] Guys, there's except responsibility for yourself, your own sin.
[time=3092] You will be held accountable before. You can't blame somebody else.
[time=3095] Someone says, "Well, the doctors tell me I have this disease.
[time=3098] This thing I was born with. I have a tendency towards this or that." It's just a disease. It's not my fault. I'm just born with it.
[time=3105] God never excuses drunkenness because you have the disease of being an alcoholic.
[time=3113] Now there may be some truth in that in your life, and you may have things that you struggle with that I don't again, but it doesn't excuse the sin. It never does.
[time=3124] Some may say, "Well, you don't understand the environment I'm in." I mean, I go to a school where I'm just surrounded by all these pressures and things, you know, people just expect me to act and behave a certain way.
[time=3134] Or maybe you say, you know, in my workplace, in my job, it's just expected that you perform a certain way, that you make certain decisions, that you talk, that you act. I mean, if I stop doing those things, that probably lives my job. So don't blame me.
[time=3149] First step is that we have to accept responsibility for our own disobedience because God will hold us accountable.
[time=3156] Secondly, he says to repent. Repent simply means changing a changed mind that results in a changed action.
[time=3165] I don't know. It's kind of an easy thing, but it's hard, I know.
[time=3169] But to come to the point in your life when you are so overwhelmed by your disobedience and how you stand before God, that at that point you say it stops here.
[time=3178] And from now on, the direction of my life changes.
[time=3181] Repent. And then it says to get a new heart and a new mind.
[time=3187] It says, "Read yourself of all the offenses you have committed and get a new heart and a new spirit." But that's what I like.
[time=3196] How do I do that? I just love that God has put this in this passage because up to this point you might think, well, see this whole thing, this whole righteousness and life and death is all dependent on what I do.
[time=3206] And here, God makes it very clear that it's not that.
[time=3209] You need a new heart. You need a new spirit.
[time=3211] To live right, you have to be changed from the inside out.
[time=3215] All right, so how do I get a new mind? How do I get a new heart?
[time=3218] How do I get a new spirit? Well, Ezekiel has talked about it before in Chapter 11.
[time=3222] He also talks about it again in Chapter 36, if you just want to flip over a few chapters.
[time=3227] In Chapter 36, God tells what he's going to do to the nation of Israel to these exiles in Babylon as he brings them back to their own land.
[time=3236] In Ezekiel 36, beginning with verse 24, God says, "For I will take you out of the nations.
[time=3244] I will guide you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.
[time=3247] I will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean.
[time=3250] I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.
[time=3253] I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.
[time=3257] I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." How do I get a new heart and a new spirit, a new heart and a new mind from God?
[time=3267] And only from God.
[time=3271] God works that change in me.
[time=3275] People might ask, "Well, why should I work at getting a new heart in mind if it's something God does?" For the same reason that this whole balance is throughout all of Scripture.
[time=3283] Obedience is never a passive thing. Obedience is never something you just kind of lay back and sit back and say, "God, make me obedient. Make me holy." You know, God doesn't work that way.
[time=3292] We have a responsibility too.
[time=3295] See, God works in us so that we can work out Philippians.
[time=3300] Well, we're told that we need to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.
[time=3304] How do we do that? Because God is working in us to will and to act according to His good pleasure.
[time=3311] Philippians 2 verses 12 and 13.
[time=3314] God works in us and we work out. It's both.
[time=3318] So how do we change except responsibility?
[time=3321] Repent and have a changed heart and mind.
[time=3325] In conclusion, verses 31, at the end of the verse,
[time=3332] God asked the question, "Why will you die, O house of Israel?
[time=3336] For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the sovereign Lord, repent and live."
[time=3343] Why will you die? Why will you be judged?
[time=3347] There's a way out, God says, "Repent and live." And I love this picture into the heart of God.
[time=3354] He says, "I take no pleasure in the death of anyone."
[time=3360] I was growing up in great school. I had a friend who, for whatever reason,
[time=3366] whatever way his little mind worked, he loved catching frogs and torturing him.
[time=3372] He'd take them out in his front lawn and spread their legs apart and pin them down and do all kinds of cruel things. I mean, it was gross.
[time=3380] I mean, I couldn't even stand and we'd start doing that.
[time=3382] I just had to walk away because even though it was just a frog, it bothered me.
[time=3385] There's something wrong about that, but he took pleasure in it.
[time=3389] We've been sharing with you music that we hope has inspired your heart
[time=3397] and the message from God's word, a powerful message.
[time=3400] We hope that you have learned something from it and that your spiritual life is enriched by the Bible hour today.
[time=3407] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, we'd like to take a moment right now and just pray a prayer with you.
[time=3415] I hope that you'll join me in this prayer right now.
[time=3418] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful I am that Jesus came to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3425] And I know that I've sinned against you and that I'm a sinner and I don't know how to go to heaven.
[time=3431] But today I know that if I trust you and you become my Savior, that I can have eternal life and dwell with you in heaven someday.
[time=3438] Please come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3442] Be my Savior today.
[time=3444] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3447] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3452] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
