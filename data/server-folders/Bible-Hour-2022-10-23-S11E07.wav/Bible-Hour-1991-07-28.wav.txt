[time=0] With rise cynicism, the late Irish poet Oscar Wilde once said, "I can resist anything except
[time=10] temptation." And the only way I know to get rid of that is to yield to it.
[time=16] Stay with us this morning.
[time=17] We're going to talk about resisting temptation from Romans chapter 6.
[time=34] Welcome to the Bible All, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=40] Thank you for joining us.
[time=42] We are pleased to welcome our pastor, Russell Moore, back from his time of vacation.
[time=47] Today's message today is a continuation in his series entitled, "The Nature of Grace."
[time=53] Resisting temptation, it sounds so easy, but for most of us it is an area of life in which
[time=59] we continually struggle.
[time=61] In today's message, Pastor Moore will address what God's word has to say about this issue.
[time=66] Please have your Bible open to Romans chapter 6.
[time=70] For the message, we will be ministered to by solos from Jennifer Crawford entitled, "In
[time=76] Return" and from Brian Losen entitled, "Only Jesus."
[time=83] Let's join our worship service as the sanctuary choir sings a medley entitled, "The Lord Thy
[time=89] God."
[time=109] The Lord thy God in the midst of He is mighty, is mighty.
[time=114] He will save me, will rejoice over thee, with joy.
[time=118] He will rest in love, he will join over thee, with joy.
[time=122] The Lord thy God in the midst of He is mighty, is mighty, is mighty.
[time=134] He will save me, will rejoice in joy, with joy.
[time=138] He will rest in love, he will join over thee.
[time=143] The Lord thy God in the midst of He is mighty, is mighty, is mighty.
[time=189] He is mighty, is mighty, is mighty, is mighty, is mighty, is mighty, is mighty, is mighty
[time=350] Jesus our blessed Redeemer the living word what a privilege to be a child of the King.
[time=356] If you will now please take your hymnals and turn to 435, hymn number 435 as we
[time=362] sing about this great friend that we have in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=367] You may remain seated as we sing what a friend we have in Jesus.
[time=388] All our hearts are to resubare. All our families share with me every day to come and pray. O Lord, we sing out with you our friend. O Lord, we must make you pray.
[time=417] O Lord, we must make you come and pray.
[time=431] Happy Father's Association, this is our holy web. We each will never be discouraged. We sing this to the holy web.
[time=456] Many by the rest of anyone, who will also share with you.
[time=468] Jesus knows our every word, sing it to the holy web.
[time=482] All our families share with you our every word, sing it to the holy web.
[time=506] Through my precious Christ for Savior, give it to the holy web.
[time=520] Give it to the holy web. Give it to the holy web.
[time=526] And that's great singing. It's always a joy to see young people share their talents and gifts for the Lord.
[time=540] I would now like to have you listen to the beautiful music ministry of Miss Jenny Crawford.
[time=570] All I had to give was a broken heart, torn apart. All I had to give was an empty hope and promises, but in return you gave me joy.
[time=591] I could never be told, when return you gave me love. It was more precious than gold, so whatever you have to give, you don't have to be ashamed.
[time=611] Just come as you are, and present it in Jesus' name for in return of a torn life. He'll give you life abundantly, and in return of a raging storm, the Lord will come to see.
[time=635] So whatever you have, the Lord has so much more, so what do you have to be?
[time=651] Oh, if you were like me, you didn't have a lot of gold. Positioner money, you didn't own wealth and toll, but I'm glad you didn't look on the things that I had.
[time=676] But you looked on the things you were able to give me. Oh, and in return he'll give you joy. I could never be told, and in return he'll give you love, and with more precious than gold, and in return for a torn life.
[time=705] He'll give you life abundantly, and in return for a raging storm, the Lord will come to see. So what do you have to give?
[time=735] Well, good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour. We're so thankful that you've decided to spend some time with us.
[time=750] Just returned from California. Had a time to be on vacation with my family, and I hope you're planning some type of getaway with your family this summer.
[time=759] It's so important to be together with the ones you love away from the regular routine of life. We come back from California so refreshed, so thankful that we're back in the state of Indiana.
[time=769] We've got many wonderful things we're trying to accomplish here at the church to see God do at Black Hawk Baptist Church, and I'd encourage you to, even if it's a small, short, brief getaway, to spend some time with your family away from the regular routine of life.
[time=783] As you know, Peter Coby, our pastor of music here at Black Hawk, is also on vacation, and he too has gone to California to be with his family and friends, and we're looking forward to his return in a couple of weeks.
[time=794] And I know you're probably awaiting that as well. What an incredible contribution Peter and the choir make to our church and to the Bible Hour.
[time=803] We're thrilled to have with us this morning as a guest Dale Siegelon who is vitally involved in the Bible Hour, and I'd like to ask you a few questions Dale about your involvement with us.
[time=815] Morning.
[time=816] What is your role with the Bible Hour?
[time=818] I'm the director of the Bible Hour that means that I coordinate the shots that are taken and use them on the other side of the camera and not on this side of the camera.
[time=827] I'm more comfortable on the other side. I'm more comfortable. I can laugh at the mistakes that the talent make instead of being on this side worrying about making them.
[time=834] Well, we're glad to have you. Tell us a little bit about the Bible Hour. How long has it been in existence and how many folks are a part of its production?
[time=842] The Bible Hour began in September of 1974, so I guess that makes it almost 17 years at this point in time.
[time=850] And it has about 10 people on a given Sunday morning that are involved. There probably are about 20 people total that are involved on a rotating basis.
[time=863] And almost all of those are lay people that just volunteer their time. They come at 730 every Sunday morning to do things like this and to prepare the Bible Hour and then to produce it during the course of the morning message.
[time=874] That's wonderful. What do you see our mission to be in the Bible Hour and how many folks do you think we're reaching?
[time=881] I think the mission is primarily just to share the essence of a live worship service with the community around the Fort Wayne area.
[time=889] There are a lot of people that can't get out whether they're in a nursing home or in the hospital or some behind bars that cannot get out and participate in a worship service.
[time=898] And so the Bible Hour offers that opportunity for them to do that. And there are others who might choose not to go to a church service but might turn on a television set and would watch programs such as the Bible Hour because it originates locally.
[time=910] And one of the few church programs that is originated locally, so we think it's an opportunity to share that as well.
[time=917] That's wonderful. And we would never want anyone to assume that the Bible Hour should be a replacement for their local church.
[time=924] We want to be a supplement to your growth, to your understanding of the word of God, your worshiping of God, but never a replacement for your local church.
[time=932] The Bible is very clear that a believer needs to be intricately involved and supported by a body of believers, a local church, a local assembly where the one and others of the New Testament can take place in their life.
[time=944] We want you to know too, as a ministry of the Bible Hour, we'd like to be able to give you God's answers for your life.
[time=951] It's a wonderfully helpful little booklet cataloging scripture in many different ways about your beginning as a Christian as you move forward in ministry and growth and being productive.
[time=964] I recommend it to you. We'd love to send it to you if you'll just write.
[time=968] You write to Blackhawk Baptist Church, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=979] Well again, thank you so much for spending time with us today, and now let's return to the regular portion of our service.
[time=1009] In your soul, you may search the wide world or, but you'll be just as before, you'll never find true satisfaction until you find the Lord,
[time=1037] for only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=1049] Only Jesus can satisfy your soul, and only he can change your heart and make you whole.
[time=1075] He'll give you peace, you never knew sweet love and joy and heaven too, for only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=1102] If you could have the fame and fortune, all the wealth you could obtain, yet you have not priced within.
[time=1119] Your living here would be in vain. They'll come a time when death shall call you.
[time=1132] Bridges cannot help you then, so come to Jesus, or only he can satisfy.
[time=1151] Only Jesus can satisfy your soul, and only he can change your heart and make you whole.
[time=1177] He'll give you peace, you never knew sweet love and joy and heaven too, for only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=1202] Yes only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=1224] Amen. Thank you Brian. We live in a culture that is desperately working to deny or at least minimize the reality that there are consequences to sin.
[time=1240] I think they do that first by trying to deny the concept of sin altogether, that it doesn't even exist.
[time=1246] And of course evolution, giving birth to relativism, giving birth to the idea that there are no moral absolutes. God is dead, sin in fact is a matter of personal choice or morality is a matter of personal choice.
[time=1259] But when the world is forced to confront sin and face it, they tend to glamorize it, they tend to minimize the consequences and depict only the positive sides of that life of sin.
[time=1273] I remember my father trying to teach me this lesson when I was about 12 or 13 years of age. We had gone to see a movie, a western movie, and I loved western movies and always wanted to be a cowboy, but this one really struck.
[time=1284] It was a butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and how Hollywood had glamorized these outlaws.
[time=1292] They were Paul Newman and Robert Redford, undisputably at that time the most handsome men in the world, supported by Catherine Ross, an outstanding, gorgeous woman.
[time=1302] Their experience? Butch was brilliant, sharp, always on the cutting edge, and he was the leader, undeniably the leader of the pack, with always the right solution to the problem.
[time=1312] Sundance, the fastest gun in the West, nobody could believe how fast he really was.
[time=1319] The relationship between these two outlaws, it was one of respect, it seemed, camaraderie, and an unusual level of honor among thieves.
[time=1329] All of that brought to bear on a huge screen, which had been shot on only the best of days from the best of angles with the best of lighting, and then all of that put to very moving and powerful music.
[time=1344] All of it designed to minimize the fact that there are consequences to sin.
[time=1349] I think my father justifiably showed some level of concern, as he saw me leaving the movie theater with him, idolizing these guys, the quickness of my step, the energy in my voice, the light in my eyes, and I'm fanning my hand like a six-hooter trying to be like Sundance.
[time=1367] I remember him suggesting that maybe it wasn't quite the way the movie said it was.
[time=1373] Patiently and carefully, he tried to help me see a little better part of reality.
[time=1378] Think with me, won't you? First of all, they were thieves.
[time=1381] They were scoundrels.
[time=1383] They made their living by stealing the hard-earned money of good, honest people like you and like me.
[time=1389] Those people, once having it stolen by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, two real historical figures, never had a chance to get their money back.
[time=1397] Life savings are gone.
[time=1399] They were undeniably adulterers, both having the same woman, frequenting brothels.
[time=1405] Probably though it's not recorded, both of them had some type of communicable disease.
[time=1410] I'm sure they were not the most handsome looking men in the world at that time.
[time=1415] They were certainly liars with no character, no self-discipline.
[time=1419] They lived their life as hunted animals, scared men, knowing that at every turn an honest man might find them and capture them and hold them accountable for their deeds.
[time=1428] And more likely than not like most thieves, they were broke, most of their life.
[time=1433] They'd get a big strike and then spend it and soon have nothing.
[time=1437] They certainly had no home, they had no family, they had no friends.
[time=1441] Their days were indeed hot and they did sweat on those days, and on other days it was cloudy.
[time=1447] And in a way far more than the little song depicted raindrops did fall on their heads.
[time=1452] It's interesting though, Hollywood doesn't want to present that side of their life.
[time=1457] Who wants to come see a movie entitled "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids" subtitled "The Life of Two Absolute Losers."
[time=1464] Subtitled again "The Consequences of Sin." Doesn't sell, nobody buys that ticket and nobody comes.
[time=1470] But further than that it doesn't fit in with the schemes of Satan who orchestrates our culture and tries to convince us that there are no consequences to sin.
[time=1479] The Bible paints a little different picture about the topic.
[time=1483] Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden.
[time=1486] Cain was made to be a vagrant and a wanderer all of his life.
[time=1490] Moses never saw the promised land.
[time=1493] Saul lost his kingdom.
[time=1495] David lost his firstborn.
[time=1496] Samson lost his strength.
[time=1498] And in Iris and Sephira lost their lives.
[time=1501] John Mark lost the privilege of ministry with the Apostle Paul.
[time=1506] There are consequences, severe consequences to sin.
[time=1509] And even we who are redeemed and love Jesus and because of that we are in fact removed from the ultimate consequences of sin, namely hell.
[time=1517] We too are subject to buy into the lie that in the here and now we can escape the consequences of sin.
[time=1524] And yet sin continues to ravage our relationships.
[time=1527] Marriages are falling apart, intimacy and true love are sabotaged.
[time=1532] Homes are literally torn apart and children are the victims of that horrible reality.
[time=1538] We are wise to heed the words that God spoke to Cain in Genesis 4.
[time=1543] Sin is crouching at the door.
[time=1547] And its desire is for you.
[time=1551] But you must master it.
[time=1562] And I know of no better chapter in all of scripture to turn to in the effort of mastering sin than Romans chapter 6.
[time=1572] Romans chapter 6.
[time=1575] We go back to this chapter and with it back to a series on the grace of God, specifically the nature, possessing the nature of grace.
[time=1586] The chapter is very clear and it's outlined. There is first a question, then an answer and then an argument to support the answer.
[time=1595] The question is found in verse 1.
[time=1597] What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace might increase?
[time=1603] I want to make an important point here.
[time=1605] This is not asking does the Christian ever reach a place where he never struggles with sin again?
[time=1611] Perfectionism. Can he put sin behind him, make sin but a memory and live a life that is so pure that sin never enters it again?
[time=1620] The answer to that is no. 1 John 1 8 says that if you say you have no sin, you deceive yourselves.
[time=1626] Galatians 6 gives an entire chapter to the idea of those who are spiritual, restoring those who are unspiritual as they've fallen into trespasses, that along with Matthew 18.
[time=1637] Even Romans 6, the chapter on Mastering Sin in verse 13 calls us to make a choice not to present the members of our body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness but instead present our bodies to God as those alive from the dead.
[time=1653] No, the Bible never teaches the doctrine of perfectionism. We will take our battle with sin to the grave as unfortunate as that is.
[time=1663] The question he is asking here is can a person come to Christ be a true believer and then continue in sin?
[time=1670] The word continue meaning abide to remain in, to have it be the habitual characteristic pattern of their life.
[time=1676] It's the hallmark of their life. They sin and they sin some more and they continue to sin.
[time=1680] It is how we describe them. They are sinners.
[time=1683] And the answer, verse 2, absolutely not. May it never be. It's the strongest Greek idiom Paul can muster. It's a term of absolute repulsion. The thought is gross in his mind.
[time=1697] You say why? And he answers that, verses 3 and following. And this would be his argument.
[time=1703] It's impossible to conceive of a true believer, habitually living in sin as his practice because and he builds his argument.
[time=1713] The first level of his argument is built off the word no. There are some things you need to know.
[time=1718] And the word no shows up several times. Verse 3, do you not know that all of us who have been baptized?
[time=1724] Verse 6, knowing this that our old self was crucified. Again in verse 9, knowing that Christ.
[time=1732] The first part of his argument and the first part of our arsenal against sin and its attempted mastery of our life is that we should know some things.
[time=1742] Then he goes to this next word in verse 11 to consider or to count. The King James Version calls it to reckon. We must then reckon that to be true and live accordingly.
[time=1755] And then the third word is in verse 13 and it's the word present or offer. The first word no is directed towards our mind. The second word count or consider to our heart the substance of faith.
[time=1770] The third word present or offer directs itself to our will and the choice that we must make.
[time=1779] What are we supposed to know? First of all, what is Paul after us to know? One in verse 3 that we have been baptized into the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1789] Somehow by a miracle of God which is not fully explained in scripture we were taken back some 2000 years from the day of our conversion and we were actually literally baptized into the person of Jesus Christ such that we now share a vital union relationship with him.
[time=1805] We have to adapt to so to immerse to identify to take a garment if you will and dip it into a dye and so radically change the identity of the garment that it is no longer what it once was.
[time=1816] It's new. The identity has been changed. Well, what is my new identity? What am I now that I've been dipped in Jesus?
[time=1827] In verse 6, knowing that our old self was crucified, one, that our body of sin might be done away with and then three that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
[time=1841] Now I believe that this verse, verse 6 is the meat and potatoes of what Paul is wanting us to understand in the nose section of this chapter and so we're going to linger here again this morning.
[time=1854] It's the heartbeat of what he wants us to know.
[time=1858] Remember, we saw last time that our old self verse 6 was crucified, our old self.
[time=1866] What is our old self? It is our sinful, corrupt, unregenerate nature that we have at the point of conception in our mother's womb and when we come out of the womb and we grow up and we finally have opportunity to express it, we are sinners because inside we're sinful.
[time=1883] It's the Adam man. It's the consequence of the fall. It's the unregenerate man. It's been crucified.
[time=1892] You say, well, what got put in its place? I mean, if it's dead, if it's gone, if it's no longer around, well, what is there now in me? What is my nature?
[time=1902] 2 Corinthians 5, 17. If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things have passed away. New things have come. Well, what are those new things? Ephesians 4, 24.
[time=1915] This new man has been created in the likeness of God in holiness and righteousness of the truth. The new you, the new nature in you has been created in holiness and righteousness of the truth.
[time=1930] Ezekiel 36, 26, talking about the new covenant in our participation in it, says we have a new heart. He has put a new spirit within you.
[time=1939] I will move the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. It's a new prevailing disposition, if you will, born a sinner, growing up and living a sinner because that's my nature.
[time=1950] That's my prevailing disposition. My bent is against God. It's instinctive. It's natural for me. At the point of salvation taken back, baptized with Christ, a new identity.
[time=1959] I'm new in Christ. I have a new nature. It's a new prevailing disposition. The longing of my heart is no longer for the things of sin. It is for God and for the things of God.
[time=1972] The question we raised at the end of our last message on this was, well, okay, fine. Then tell me this. Why do I still struggle internally with the desire to sin?
[time=1983] If my old nature is crucified, I only have a new nature. Then would you please help me understand what it is inside of me that's so attracted to sin?
[time=1993] Well, I think the answer to that is also found in verse 6. Look at it, knowing this, that our old self was crucified with him, that our body of sin might be done away with.
[time=2006] There it is, the body of sin. Paul always explains the believer's struggle with sin to be seated in the body of sin or the flesh or the members of his body.
[time=2021] He never uses the term old nature or sinful nature. Now, before I go any further, I want to pause. And I want to say, I know this is a controversial subject.
[time=2033] In fact, after I preached my message last Sunday or two Sundays ago, I was so thankful, a thinking member of our congregation gave me a little letter.
[time=2041] And I said this, I assume you will juxtapose how to go look that up.
[time=2048] This "new concept" that we do not have conflict of nature within us. To Paul's struggle of doing what we don't want to do, why do we do it if the old nature isn't warring within us?
[time=2067] Many of you have been taught that there is in you an old nature and a new nature, a black dog and a white dog. And depending upon which one you feed and cultivate, that's the bigger and the stronger.
[time=2078] Now, before I go on to give you what I believe the Bible teaches on this, and it is different than that, I want to make a couple of comments, a framework for us to think about all of this.
[time=2089] First of all, in seminary we were so disappointed in many of the commentators. We would be in class on a subject such as this, and the conversation would be flying back and forth and the professors barely hanging on to control in the room.
[time=2101] And we're all fighting for our viewpoints, and we'd break from class and run to the library and pull down all the commentaries looking to find some help.
[time=2108] And oftentimes on a highly controversial subject such as this one, the commentator would do what we coined in seminary, he would burp and go on, if you'll excuse my French.
[time=2118] He would come to a very difficult place, kind of acknowledge it as such and then kind of burp and just, well, here we go, there's my end of suggestion, I've taken care of that and on I go.
[time=2128] I'm not going to do that this morning, I'm going to do my very best to tell you exactly what I think about this.
[time=2134] I'm not going to sidestep the issue, I was kind of tempted to after I got that note, I'm thinking, oh my lens, what have I gotten myself into?
[time=2141] I think I'll just run around this thing, you know, but I can't do that. I've got to tell you what I think, the Bible says, we're in this passage and I've got to preach it to you.
[time=2150] So before I jump out of the frying pan and into the fire, I want you to know my heart attitude.
[time=2157] I didn't pick this series or this message because of its volatility index at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2163] In other words, I was not aware of the extent to which my view might be different on this, but it is in my heart to preach it because I am excited about the grace of God and the nature that is ours because of the grace of God, and I want you to be able to share in that as well.
[time=2177] But no, beyond all of that, if at the end of this, I have preached as hard as I can preach and have been as persuasive as I know how to be, if you still disagree with me, that's okay.
[time=2192] We're still friends, right?
[time=2196] You have a Bible in your hands, thanks to the Reformation and other things in the sovereignty of God, and you are the one to read it and to discern, and I will do my best to teach you what I believe is the truth,
[time=2206] but you must also think and listen and learn, and if you still disagree with me, that's okay.
[time=2211] I may be wrong.
[time=2212] Think about that for a minute.
[time=2216] I may just be wrong.
[time=2217] In fact, I know, beyond a shadow of doubt, that I have air and flaw and untruth in my theology and doctrine.
[time=2224] I know that's true.
[time=2225] I know I have air in my, I just don't know where it is.
[time=2233] And if I knew where it was, I'd change it.
[time=2237] In fact of the matter it is, I may be wrong on this text.
[time=2241] I may be wrong.
[time=2244] If I am, that's okay.
[time=2246] I'm giving you the best I can out of the convictions that I have through my study of the Word of God, and if we differ, okay, that's fine.
[time=2253] And we have to be that way as a church.
[time=2255] You have to give me the freedom to preach as strong and as true as I can, and I have to give you the freedom to go.
[time=2260] That guy was off the wall, right?
[time=2263] And we move forward together as Blackhawk Baptist Church to serve our great and awesome God.
[time=2268] So with that as a context in which we might disagree, let me continue.
[time=2273] Why then do I struggle with sin?
[time=2277] If I don't have an old nature and a new nature, if I only have a new nature, why do I still feel like I have an old nature?
[time=2284] And then how do you explain this struggle inside my soul?
[time=2288] Well, the body of sin, back to Romans 6-6, is the unredeemed humanness that remains until one is transformed into heavenly glory.
[time=2299] Your unredeemed humanness.
[time=2303] Scripture clearly teaches that the remaining humanness somehow retains certain weaknesses and propensities to sin.
[time=2312] But I want to say again, Paul never says that that struggle against sin finds its seat in the believer's nature.
[time=2321] He's very comfortable saying that it lies in the unbeliever's nature.
[time=2325] I won't take you there, but if you were to look at Ephesians 2 and he describes the unbeliever who is caught in his trespasses and his sin,
[time=2332] and who is living in the lust of the flesh and the desires of his mind, it's because it says right there they are by nature children of wrath.
[time=2339] He ties all of their sinful behavior back to their nature.
[time=2342] They're just living out what they are on the inside.
[time=2345] Had an opportunity to be with some guys the other day, one of whom was not a believer, and the other guys were, and they all knew I was the preacher, and they were all really nervous because the one guy who's not a believer, he cusses up a storm.
[time=2356] I mean, the guy's just whoof comes out of there hot and fast and furious, and everybody's worried about the poor preacher boy.
[time=2362] How's he going to handle this?
[time=2364] And I wanted to reassure you, but it doesn't bother me.
[time=2367] I mean, I'm sorry that he takes the Lord's name in vain, he's going to have to account for that with the Lord, but that man is just speaking out of his heart.
[time=2374] And he's got an unregenerate heart, he's a sinful man, he's just living his life the way I would expect him to live it.
[time=2380] Right?
[time=2381] You've got to stop expecting unbelievers to act like believers because something fundamentally different is in the side of both of those people.
[time=2388] One people, they're unredeemed, they're unregenerate, they're sinful, it's their nature to sin, they sin.
[time=2392] It doesn't mean we condone it, it doesn't mean we accept it.
[time=2395] But we don't try to force them to live like a believer.
[time=2398] The only way you can live like a believer is to get a new nature and live according to your nature.
[time=2404] So Paul is very comfortable saying about the unbeliever, they sin because of their unregenerate nature, because of their being children of wrath.
[time=2414] But with the believer, he always and exclusively ties their sinful behavior back, not to their nature, but to one of usually three terms, their flesh, their body of sin or the members of their body.
[time=2429] There is indwelling sin in the believer, look over now to Romans chapter 7.
[time=2436] We do have indwelling sin, look at verse 18, and I'll come back to verse 18 because it's going to throw a flag as soon as you read it.
[time=2444] For I know that nothing good dwells in me, no, go back to 17, I'm sorry, so now no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which indwells me.
[time=2456] There is indwelling sin. Paul always says that that indwelling sin finds its seat, not in old nature or a sinful nature, but in flesh, body of sin, or the members of our body.
[time=2469] Now there are two major passages in the scriptures that deal with this struggle inside the believer to gain victory over sin.
[time=2478] You're in one of them, so hold your finger there, and now come with me back over to Galatians chapter 5.
[time=2487] Verse 17, here it is, Galatians 5, 17, for the flesh, what's your Bible saying?
[time=2499] Sinful nature, your Bible says sinful nature, my Bible says flesh.
[time=2504] For the flesh sets its desire against what?
[time=2508] The Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are in opposition to one another so that you may not do the things that you please.
[time=2515] And then he goes on to describe what we hate about our lives, verse 19, the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are, and then there's this long list of horrible, gross sin.
[time=2525] And then he compares it, verse 22, but, or in contrast to that, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, generalist self-control.
[time=2535] Now your Bible, says, many of you who are carrying the NIV this morning, says sinful nature.
[time=2542] And in studying this, when I started this series, I had no idea the NIV said sinful nature.
[time=2549] I thought I said flesh.
[time=2552] So I was explaining to this to one of the guys on staff that in my office, you know, about two weeks ago, saying that Paul only and always exclusively says that your sin as a believer is tied not to your old nature or your sinful nature, but to your flesh.
[time=2567] Well, my new American standard was at home.
[time=2571] So I just kind of casually reach up on my shelf and grab an NIV and I pop it open to Romans 7 and Galatians 5, and to my astonishment, it says, for the sinful nature sets its desire.
[time=2582] And I turned white, I thought this is it, I'm wrong, forever.
[time=2586] I've misunderstood this.
[time=2589] So after I somehow ended that meeting and locked my door, I got out my Greek New Testament.
[time=2598] I thought to myself, gee whiz, why is there such a disparity in translation here?
[time=2604] Why does mine say flesh every time and this other Bible say sinful nature?
[time=2610] Well, I personally like the fact that the NIV said sinful nature for at least one reason because that really gives you an idea that there's a struggle going on in there, right?
[time=2622] And there is a struggle and it is inside of us, it is indwelling sin, but I got to confess that I wouldn't have used sinful nature if I were translating the NIV simply because Paul never does.
[time=2637] When you study these two passages, the word nature, which is psychicos or fuses, those are the two main words for nature in the Greek, psychicos and fuses.
[time=2650] They never appear in Romans 7 or in Galatians 5.
[time=2657] The only word that appears there is sarcos, which is the Greek word for flesh.
[time=2663] Now, when a group of translators sit down together, sometimes they will make a decision to bring the Bible into translation and also interpretation.
[time=2671] It gives some help to the reader and many times it's wonderfully helpful.
[time=2675] Many times the NIV is enormously helpful because the choices they have made have really aided the reader in the understanding.
[time=2682] In my opinion, they failed you in Romans 7 and Galatians 5.
[time=2687] There is no other way to translate sarcos except with the word flesh unless you put other words in there that reflect a theological perspective and that's what's been done.
[time=2702] Now, that's okay, so long as you know about it, so long as you're aware of it.
[time=2709] Psychicos and fuses, both of the words for nature in the New Testament, never appear in Romans 7 or in Galatians 5.
[time=2717] What does appear? Sarcos. Now, look at Galatians 5, 17 again.
[time=2721] For the flesh or sarcos sets its desire against the spirit and the spirit against the sarcos or the flesh, for these are in opposition one to another so that you may not do the things that you please.
[time=2735] Flip back now to Romans 7.
[time=2739] Start with verse 17, "For now no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which indwells me."
[time=2745] Verse 18, "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is in my what, in my sinful nature or in my flesh."
[time=2752] Well, the Greek word there is sarcos, "that is in my flesh, for the wishing is present in me, but the doing of good is not."
[time=2764] What's Paul saying?
[time=2766] Why is he working so hard and so consistently in the New Testament to avoid ever attributing sin in the believer, not the unbeliever, but the believer,
[time=2776] always avoiding tying it back to his new nature or even his old nature because that's been crucified.
[time=2782] Why does he always tie it back to body of sin, flesh, or the members of my body?
[time=2791] Well, listen to him again in Romans 7.
[time=2795] And listen to him explain the true longing of his heart, this new nature longing for God,
[time=2802] but somehow being caught in this unredeemed humanness which keeps him from doing and being who he really wants to be.
[time=2811] Start again, verse 17, "So now no longer am I the one doing it, my new nature, but sin which indwells me, for I know that nothing good dwells in me."
[time=2824] Now, what do I mean by that? I mean that is in my flesh, "For the wishing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not."
[time=2833] Verse 19, "For the good that I wish I do not do, but I do the very evil that I do not wish."
[time=2840] I don't want to do that stuff.
[time=2843] Verse 20, "But if I am doing the very thing that I do not wish, I am no longer the one doing it, it's not my new nature, it's the sin that dwells in me."
[time=2854] Verse 21, "I find then the principle that evil is present in me, somehow the one who wishes to do good."
[time=2862] Now, verse 22, "For I joyfully concur with the law of God and the inner man, but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members."
[time=2877] Then he cries out, "Wretched man that I am, who shall set me free from what? The body of this death, not my old nature, the body of my death or of this death."
[time=2891] Then he cries out with joy, "Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord, so then on the one hand I myself with my mind, am serving the law of God, but on the other with my flesh, sarcos, the law of sin."
[time=2908] It's amazing.
[time=2909] It's powerful.
[time=2911] The conflict is not a conflict of identity. I am new. I love God. I want to love God. I want to obey God.
[time=2921] That's who I really am. Paul is saying, "Listen, Romans 6, no, no, no, you've got to know some things about yourself which aren't immediately apparent by your own experience, so I'll tell you about them."
[time=2933] You went back 2000 years. You got baptized into the person of Jesus Christ dipped and changed. Well, what does it look like? You're new. You have a new nature. You've got to know that, he says.
[time=2945] But remember, your body of sin is with you and with that you will struggle all of your life.
[time=2951] You are caught. This indwelling sin finds its home somehow in your flesh, not this stuff hanging on my bones, but the humanness, the body of sin, and you'll fight it all your life. But there's hope.
[time=2963] Look again at verse 6, knowing this that our old self, Romans 6, excuse me, knowing this that our old self was crucified with him, that our body of sin might be done away with.
[time=2976] You know what that word is? It's an awesome word. It says that sin, the body of sin, is no longer in absolute control.
[time=2988] Don't turn there. Let me read it to you. Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 uses the exact same Greek word, katargeo. It's speaking of Satan. Listen to this.
[time=2998] That Christ, through death, might render powerless him who had the power of death. That is the devil. Christ has katargeoed the devil.
[time=3010] Now it's important. It doesn't say that he has annihilated Satan, and we would never think of that because that's not true. Satan is very much alive. He is very active. He is very powerful.
[time=3019] 2 Peter warns us that he roams about on the face of the earth like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. He's been defeated. The battle is over. Christ won at the cross.
[time=3029] He cannot win, but he is not gone. He is not annihilated. He is like a deposed monarch who runs around the country having been thrown from the throne, looking for any opportunity to do harm.
[time=3041] Ephesians chapter 6 tells us to watch out for the schemes of the devil. The spiritual forces of wickedness and the heavenly places but resist him stand firm. Why? Because he is not in absolute control of your life. He's there. He's a formidable foe, and you'd better respect him, but he's not in charge.
[time=3061] Jesus is, because Jesus wanted the cross. The same is true of your flesh. The same is true of your body of sin. You are new inside, but you are stuck in this unredeemed flesh.
[time=3072] This indwelling sin, and so Paul cries out who will deliver me from this body of sin. In Romans 80, he cries out 8.23, waiting eagerly the adoption of the sons, the redemption of my body. Because he knows once he's out of his body, he's off and running for Jesus totally and exclusively. Perfectionism in heaven.
[time=3092] Never, though, when he still is in his body. And so this body of sin, this flesh, hounds us, but it has been done away with in the sense that it has been no longer given absolute control. You can say no.
[time=3109] Don't ever let anybody tell you that they had no choice about their sin. Don't let anybody ever say the devil made me do it. It was too tempting. It was out of my power. It was just too enormous. No, my friends, you are new in Christ.
[time=3123] You struggle with your body of sin, but even that has been done away with to the extent that it is no longer an absolute control and sin for you is a choice. A choice. And you can say no.
[time=3138] Let me give you an illustration. Somebody comes into my office, counseling appointment. I'm struggling with lust. I don't know what to do. The temptation is so strong. It's so overwhelming. It's so powerful.
[time=3149] How should that believer think about himself at the moment of that crisis when lust is aroused? And that seems all that is satisfying in life.
[time=3159] What Paul says you should know about yourself is first as he faces that lustful situation is one. That is not me. That is not what I really want. The new me has been made new in Christ. Doesn't want lust. It wants God.
[time=3172] It doesn't feel like it, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm new and that my true longing and my true prevailing disposition is for God.
[time=3179] Secondly, as I feel my flesh wanting to rise up and seize and grab and delight and enter into all the world of lust would have, I can say to my body of sin and you are not in control either.
[time=3191] The power of sin has been broken in my life so that look again at verse 6, very into the verse that I should no longer be slaves to sin. I'm free.
[time=3201] I'm free from the power of sin. I don't have to have sin be my master. Why? I'm new. My body of sin has been rendered powerless that I should no longer be slaves to sin.
[time=3218] Never underestimate the power of truth in your life as opposed to experience and what you feel.
[time=3228] Over and over and over again, Paul ties the sanctification process to the mind.
[time=3233] He says in Romans 12, 1 and 2, be transformed. Do not be conformed to this world. Conformed means to take a pose that is not your own. It's a fate pose.
[time=3243] It's not the real you. Don't be conformed to the world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Christian, do you know who you really are?
[time=3255] He's saying. You must know the reality of your baptism in Christ and your newness in Christ and the ineffective power of sin in your life tied and locked in your humanness so you can say no to it and no longer be a slave to sin.
[time=3269] The power of perspective, if it's truth.
[time=3273] Ted Inksram in his delightful little book, The Pursuit of Excellence, illustrates the point.
[time=3278] An American Indian tells about a brave who found an eagle's egg and put it into the nest of a prairie chicken.
[time=3284] The eagle it hatched with the brood of chicks and grew up with them.
[time=3289] All his life, the changeling eagle thinking he was a prairie chicken, did what the prairie chickens did. He scratched in the dirt for seeds and insects to eat. He clucked and cackled.
[time=3299] He flew in brief thrashing of wings and a flurry of feathers no more than a few feet above the ground.
[time=3304] After all, that's how prairie chickens are supposed to fly.
[time=3308] Years passed and the changeling eagle grew very old. One day he saw a magnificent bird far above him in the cloudless sky hanging with graceful majesty on the powerful wind currents.
[time=3321] It soared with scarcely a beak of its strong golden wings.
[time=3327] "What a beautiful bird!" said the changeling eagle through his neighbor.
[time=3332] "What is it?" "That's an eagle. The chief of the birds the neighbor clucked. But don't give it a second thought. You could never be like him."
[time=3343] So the changeling eagle never gave it another thought and it died thinking it was a prairie chicken.
[time=3352] The Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he. The powerful role of the word no in your life as the basis of true doctrine about who you are in Christ is fundamental and essential to your victory over sin.
[time=3368] Ephesians 4, 23 says that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind. The mind is the gateway to your heart and to your soul.
[time=3378] What a tragedy. Built to soar into the heaven but conditioned to stay earthbound. He pecked at stray seeds and chased insects, though designed to be among the most awesome of all foul incidents.
[time=3392] We've been sharing with you music that we hope has inspired your heart and the message from God's word a powerful message.

[time=3417] Dear Heavenly Father, how thankful I am that Jesus came to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3424] And I know that I've sinned against you and that I'm a sinner and I don't know how to go to heaven.
[time=3430] But today I know that if I trust you and you become my savior that I can have eternal life and dwell with you in heaven someday.
[time=3437] Please come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed. Be my savior today. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
