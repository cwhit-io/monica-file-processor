[time=0] 2 The Horace Mann, the great educator, once said that habits are like a cable.
[time=7] We weave a strand of it every day and soon it can't be broken.
[time=12] Sinful habits, they can destroy a person's life.
[time=16] Stay with us this morning.
[time=17] We're going to study Romans chapter 6 and find from God's Word how He has given us the
[time=23] resources to break the sinful habits in our lives.
[time=30] 1 Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=45] Thank you for joining us.
[time=47] Pastor Moore will be continuing his series of messages entitled "Possessing the Nature of Grace." Formed one day at a time, one strand at a time until they become a strong core.
[time=61] Would you like to know how to break a bad habit?
[time=63] Listen today as Pastor Russ opens God's Word to Romans chapter 6 to address this issue
[time=69] which affects each and every one of us.
[time=72] Before today's message, we will be ministered to by a solo from Denise Mitchell entitled "We Sing Praise" and a duet from Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe entitled "Friend Indeed."
[time=87] Let's join our worship service as the sanctuary choir begins our preparation for worship with the familiar hymn "Praise Him, Praise Him."
[time=111] "Praise Him, Praise Him, Jesus, not much of me, keep them safe over His wonderful love
[time=126] proclaim, Hail with faith, I start angels in glory, Sing their joy, be His world in the end, my gosh, and poor, Jesus, who are His children, give this all the seed, and it's all the glory of God."
[time=155] Praise Him, Praise Him, God is absolutely grateful, Praise Him, Praise Him, and her joyful soul.
[time=170] "Praise Him, Praise Him, Jesus, not much of me, keep them, for our sin, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, it's all the glory of God."
[time=187] "Praise Him, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, it's all the glory of God."
[time=216] "Praise Him, Praise Him, help us just with greatness, Praise Him, Praise Him, and her joyful soul."
[time=234] "Praise Him, Praise Him, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, Jesus, not much of me, it's all the glory of God."
[time=264] [MUSIC - 62 seconds]
[time=331] Amen. We want to praise Jesus Christ, ever-enjoyful song.
[time=335] Shall we continue doing just that as we turn to Him number 298?
[time=340] Him 298, O Zion haste.
[time=343] You may remain seated as we sing verses 1, 2, and 4.
[time=348] (Organ music playing)
[time=535] Amen. It's always of joy and pleasure to be ministered to by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe.
[time=542] I just appreciate their testimony and their faithfulness and dedication to the service of the Lord.
[time=547] He's given them great instruments to be used of Him.
[time=549] Now be listened to by Denise Mitchell.
[time=552] [MUSIC]
[time=632] Oh Father, Son, and Holy Spirit reigns.
[time=641] I'm so glad His truth lives on in me.
[time=647] Yes I am, but no man.
[time=653] Roll the stone away when He gave the greatest gift at Calvary.
[time=665] We sing praises to the Lord King of Kings.
[time=673] We sing praises to the Lord His majesty.
[time=681] We sing praises to the Lord King of Kings right now.
[time=693] [MUSIC]
[time=774] Well good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=776] We're so thankful that you've joined us again.
[time=779] Peter Kobe is still on vacation out in California.
[time=782] We understand he's having a tremendous time, but looking forward to his return.
[time=787] This morning we're privileged to have the principle of Blackhawk Christian School Steve Longbreak.
[time=793] Good morning.
[time=794] Good morning Russell.
[time=795] We're thankful that you've joined us this morning.
[time=796] Tell us a little bit about Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=798] I'm glad to be here too to talk about the school.
[time=801] In 1973 some people here at the church decided that they wanted an educational institution that was really founded on the Word of God and to try to stick to that no matter what the pressures were to change.
[time=814] And so they began a school and in 1981 we graduated our first class.
[time=819] So we've graduated 11 since then and we've had a tremendous start.
[time=824] Opportunities to teach the Word and tell the truth about God's view is planned for life for children and how it fits into English and math and social studies and all those subject areas.
[time=835] It's been a great time here.
[time=837] Tell us a little bit about your faculty.
[time=839] You know we only had to hire one teacher this year and that's because we added another third grade class.
[time=846] Our faculty has been here an average of about eight years now.
[time=851] Each faculty member has an average of about eight school years.
[time=855] And we're grateful for that.
[time=857] Their longevity is a real reason for our success.
[time=860] We have a lot of people that are real happiness because those teachers are so good, so dedicated to the Lord and professional and everything that they do and they've been here.
[time=869] They stay and it gets easier for us collectively to operate the longer they stay.
[time=873] I'm really thankful.
[time=875] Now you have a waiting list don't you?
[time=878] Yeah we do.
[time=879] We started double tracking our school about four years ago.
[time=884] So this is our third grade class that's been added this year.
[time=887] Kindergarten through third grade is double track.
[time=889] The rest of the classes we have waiting lists for.
[time=892] But there are openings in Kindergarten through third grade and I want to emphasize that.
[time=895] We need those Kindergarteners to bring them up through the ranks.
[time=899] Well that is fantastic.
[time=900] Well I know that my children are very, very excited about being a part of the school.
[time=905] In fact even as I was candidate to come and to be a part of Blackhawk, I remember the tour you took me on.
[time=911] My first visit and we walked through the school and from classroom to classroom and I was overwhelmed with the sense of order, the academic excellence, the respect, the relationship between teacher and student.
[time=925] And I know that Heidi and I went away from our first visit realizing that if God would lead us to Blackhawk, one of the greatest blessings would be that our children could be in your school.
[time=935] That day was really a great day for me too.
[time=938] I enjoyed that.
[time=939] I hadn't been in every classroom in one day for a long time.
[time=942] We toured almost every classroom in the building.
[time=945] It was a great time.
[time=946] And if you'd like information about Blackhawk Christian School, I wish you'd call us at 4937400.
[time=954] We'll be glad to send you any information that you'd like to have and then we'll be glad to talk with you.
[time=959] If you'd care to have an appointment, I'd love to sit down and talk with you about Christian education.
[time=965] One of the things that happens to us in life is something very valuable
[time=971] will be taken from us.
[time=972] In fact, Steve and I are constantly in prayer for a young man who's a part of our school.
[time=979] He has cancer and we don't know what the Lord is going to do with his life.
[time=984] Right now the Lord has taken this young man's health.
[time=987] He's been in the hospital for eight to ten weeks and has just come out.
[time=991] And our hearts are with him and we support him, but life can be disappointing in some profound ways and it causes grief.
[time=998] The book we want to offer you is called Good Grief.
[time=1002] And it's a tremendous book that helps us from a Christian perspective to learn to deal with the hurt and the pain and the disappointment of loss in our lives, just not loss of a loved one, but sometimes even loss of a job.
[time=1017] Many of us are struggling in our church with some unemployment and life is hard.
[time=1023] Life doesn't always work the way we want it to.
[time=1025] If you'd write to us at the Bible Hour, we'd love to send this to you.
[time=1029] It's Good Grief, a very, very helpful book.
[time=1032] Maybe there's somebody in your life who's struggling with the loss of a loved one or a job or some other thing like that.
[time=1038] Right, it's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East-State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=1044] 46815.
[time=1049] Well, the only other thing is we want you to know that on August 16th, we have the privilege of having a man by the name of Greg Buchanan.
[time=1056] And believe it or not, this man plays the harp.
[time=1059] He's tremendous.
[time=1060] It'll be a wonderful evening.
[time=1062] I promise you that.
[time=1063] I know him from the Masters College when I was Vice President of Student Affairs there.
[time=1067] And we invited him to come and had absolutely no idea of how tremendous he would be.
[time=1074] I know the students walked in and saw this harp sitting on the stage and thought, "Uh-oh, this is going to be a sleeper chapel." But Greg came in and played the harp in some incredible ways.
[time=1082] It was a tremendous evening of worship.
[time=1084] We'd love for you to join us for that evening, August 16th.
[time=1088] Well, now let's return to the regular portion of our program.
[time=1097] Somebody here has a broken heart.
[time=1108] Somebody's going to cry when they're all alone.
[time=1116] Somebody here just does not quite yet understand that Jesus died to bear.
[time=1125] Every single care that we have.
[time=1133] There's no heartache, there's no pain.
[time=1137] He cannot feel.
[time=1144] Not a wounded spirit, he cannot hear.
[time=1148] No burden to big to bear, or alone, he won't share.
[time=1158] Causing our weakness, he's a friend and dear.
[time=1178] Somebody here has a question now, wondering if others ever hurt this way.
[time=1192] Somebody's dying just to know that Jesus hears every single thought,
[time=1202] and he will never leave you alone.
[time=1210] There's no heartache, there's no pain.
[time=1214] He cannot feel.
[time=1221] Not a wounded spirit, he cannot hear.
[time=1225] No burden to big to bear, or alone, he won't share.
[time=1235] Causing our weakness, he's a friend and dear.
[time=1244] He sees, he feels, he knows.
[time=1252] Every heartache we endure.
[time=1258] And for each of life's worlds.
[time=1266] I know that Jesus is the cure.
[time=1271] He is the cure.
[time=1274] Yes he is.
[time=1276] There's no heartache, there's no pain.
[time=1279] That he cannot feel.
[time=1286] Not a wounded spirit, he cannot hear.
[time=1291] No burden to big to bear, or alone, he won't share.
[time=1300] Causing our weakness, he's a friend and dear.
[time=1305] No heartache, there's no pain.
[time=1308] That he cannot feel.
[time=1316] Not a wounded spirit, he cannot hear.
[time=1320] No burden to big to bear, or alone, he won't share.
[time=1330] Causing our weakness, he's a friend and dear.
[time=1350] Amen, praise God is right.
[time=1358] If you're thankful that you're a part of Blackhawk Baptist Church, just say amen.
[time=1363] [AMEN] What an incredible privilege is ours to be a part of this great body of believers.
[time=1371] If you have your Bibles this morning, I invite you to take it and open it to Romans chapter 6
[time=1377] for what I think is our last time in this series, Romans chapter 6.
[time=1382] And I'd like to open with a little question for you, a fill in the blank question.
[time=1388] Here it is.
[time=1390] There is not a person who has ever lived, including Jesus who has not faced it.
[time=1398] And there has never been a person on the face of the earth except Jesus who has not yielded to it at one point or another.
[time=1406] Answer.
[time=1407] Temptation.
[time=1408] Did you think sin?
[time=1410] Maybe temptation.
[time=1411] Let me read it again with the word.
[time=1413] There is not a person who has ever lived, including Jesus who has not faced it.
[time=1417] And there has never been a person on the face of the earth except Jesus who has not yielded to it at one time or another.
[time=1426] Answer.
[time=1427] Temptation.
[time=1428] Did you think sin?
[time=1430] Maybe temptation.
[time=1431] Let me read it again with the word.
[time=1433] There is not a person who has ever lived, including Jesus who has not faced temptation.
[time=1439] And there has never been a person on the face of the earth except Jesus who has not yielded to temptation at one time or another.
[time=1450] With rise cynicism, the late Irish poet Oscar Wilde wrote, "I can resist everything except temptation.
[time=1460] And the only way I get rid of temptation, yield to it." James said, "But each one is tempted when he is carried away by his own lusts."
[time=1472] And I would like to invite you this morning to think with me just briefly back to the last time you can remember being severely tempted to sin.
[time=1482] Where were you?
[time=1483] Was it last night?
[time=1484] Was it yesterday?
[time=1485] Was it sometime this week?
[time=1489] What was the issue?
[time=1491] Were you tempted to gossip, to be involved in gluttony, materialism, sensuality, laziness?
[time=1506] Was it your old familiar stumbling ground where you fall over and over and over again and in your mind have little hope of ever really gaining victory?
[time=1515] Listen, if you will, with the thought of temptation in your mind to the way it is described by a great theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[time=1523] "In our members there is a slumbering inclination towards desire, which is both sudden and fierce.
[time=1532] With irresistible power desire seizes mastery over the flesh, all at once a secret smoldering fire is kindled.
[time=1542] The flesh burns and is in flames.
[time=1545] It makes no difference if it is sexual desire or ambition or vanity or desire for vengeance.
[time=1551] Joy and God is extinguished within us, and we seek all our joy in ourselves."
[time=1558] At this moment, God is quite unreal to us.
[time=1563] Satan does not here fill us with hatred of God, but forgetfulness of God.
[time=1569] Lust aroused envelops the mind and will in deepest darkness, and the powers of clear discrimination and decision are taken from us.
[time=1579] It's a powerful description.
[time=1581] I like the way he emphasizes the loss of our rational thought process.
[time=1587] God is quite unreal, it's not hatred of God, it's forgetfulness of God.
[time=1592] It's a will and a mind enveloped in deepest darkness.
[time=1597] It's the powers of clear discrimination taken from us at that critical point.
[time=1604] I believe that's exactly why in Romans chapter 6 Paul moves us in his argument from the know, the doctrine that we must know, that our identity is now with Christ.
[time=1614] We've been dipped, if you will, our identity, therefore, has been changed.
[time=1621] The old self was crucified with him, the body of sin has been done away with.
[time=1624] Why? That we should no longer be slaves to sin, but he moves in his argument out of the know, the doctrine, the facts, the truth of what has happened to us as a result of our salvation to this other word in verse 11.
[time=1636] Even so consider, or count, or reckon in the King James yourselves to be dead to sin but alive to God.
[time=1648] Reckon, la gizami in the Greek, it's a powerful word, it means simply this, to add up the facts.
[time=1656] It's a mathematician's word or an accountant's word, to count up or to number the money in an account and determine its balance.
[time=1665] It's not based on feeling, it's based on fact.
[time=1668] What are the facts here and how do I add them up and what is their proper conclusion?
[time=1673] Metaphorically then, it is the idea of fully affirming truth that is factual, to reckon it to be true.
[time=1679] I've been told it's true, but now I must reckon it so.
[time=1682] I must add it up and see it for what it is.
[time=1686] Though the indwelling flesh and the sin, excuse me, the indwelling sin and the flesh are screaming for gratification,
[time=1693] at that very point I must reckon what God has said to be true, in fact to be true.
[time=1701] God has in other words given us resources, vast spiritual resources, but we must believe that he has, or it's as if he hasn't.
[time=1712] When we think about the know of Romans 6, those first nine or ten verses, we understand the resources that are ours in Christ.
[time=1719] Ephesians 1 says that he has given us everything pertaining to life, excuse me, that he has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=1728] It's Peter who tells us he's given us everything pertaining to life and godliness.
[time=1733] We have vast spiritual resources because of our newness in Christ to live differently.
[time=1739] The question is, well, will we reckon it so?
[time=1742] Will we count it so when we need to and live differently?
[time=1746] It's as if someone has come with ten million dollars and said to you, I've noticed your life and I want to give this to you out of my abundance.
[time=1757] Your clothing is worn out, your children are hungry and sick and I know they're in need of medical attention that you can't afford.
[time=1765] I know your car is broken down and you have no transportation here, let me give you this.
[time=1770] In fact, I've already given it to you, I put it in your bank account.
[time=1773] All you need to do now is start writing checks.
[time=1776] The resources are there, live like it.
[time=1779] John G. Wendell is remembered as America's most miserly millionaire.
[time=1788] It's said of him that he died in 1915 at his home on Fifth Avenue in 39th Street in New York City.
[time=1796] To keep in the family the vast fortune he and his six sisters had inherited, Wendell remained a bachelor and managed to keep five of the girls unmarried and virtual prisoners in the house for some 50 years.
[time=1810] Furthermore, he instilled such frugality in his sisters that when the last one died in 1931, it was found that while her estate amounted to more than 100 million dollars, she had never had a telephone, electricity or an automobile.
[time=1830] She lived in abject poverty, saved the house.
[time=1836] Spiritual miser is what we are.
[time=1840] When we refuse to reckon and to acknowledge that God has done something profound and awesome, he has given me spiritual resources which allow me to live differently.
[time=1850] Am I writing checks?
[time=1853] And I would hasten to add this is not a psychological mind game whereby we say over and over to ourselves, Romans 6, 11, "I'm dead to sin, I'm dead to sin, I'm dead to sin, I'm alive to God, I'm alive to God as if by some power of positive thinking to convince myself of what really isn't true, pretend that is and live like it anyway."
[time=1871] The opposite is true.
[time=1873] In fact, we are dead to sin.
[time=1875] God has changed everything.
[time=1877] The question is, will we believe it?
[time=1880] An act on it.
[time=1882] It's difficult.
[time=1884] So the picture is clear, God has given vast spiritual resources.
[time=1889] Are we going to reckon it true at the point of temptation?
[time=1895] Now I should say that believing the word of God has never been presented as an easy matter in Scripture.
[time=1902] In fact, the opposite is true. Men, throughout recorded biblical history, have in fact been applauded for their courage to reckon what God has said is true and then live on that.
[time=1914] The most notable example would be Abram.
[time=1918] The name means father of many, it was later changed to Abraham, which means not just father of many, but father of many nations.
[time=1926] He was called father of many, but he was father of none.
[time=1932] He had no children.
[time=1935] In Genesis 12, verse 2, God said, "I will make you a great nation." And then he took him out in Genesis 15 out of his tent and made him look up into the sky of the evening and look at all the stars and say, "Count them!"
[time=1950] And of course he couldn't and that was the point.
[time=1952] "So shall your descendants be. I will give you more children than you could ever number."
[time=1958] Father of many, father of none.
[time=1963] Interestingly enough, when he finally came to the Promised Land and there remained childless for so many years, he found himself on a strategic route from Egypt to the cities and countries of the north and the east.
[time=1975] And as a result, vast caravans of animals and people would move through with all of their property for trade and along the way they would need supplies.
[time=1984] They'd need to be fed. They'd need water and Abram owned all the wells.
[time=1989] And so they would stop at his wells and they would buy from him and Genesis 13 says Abram was very rich in cattle and silver and in gold.
[time=1997] He was famous, very wealthy man.
[time=2000] And as would be the custom, though it's never revealed in Scripture, it's easy enough to understand and believe that the men of these leading these caravans having received their resources would then go to Abram and say, "Thank you, thank you!"
[time=2014] And to settle their account and the conversation must have gone the same way every time.
[time=2019] "I'm so and so. I'm with this caravan. We're heading this way. What is your name?" To which he would have to answer, father of many, Abram.
[time=2029] And they'd say, "Congratulations! How many do you have?" None. None.
[time=2038] Had a name but couldn't back it up.
[time=2043] Must have happened hundreds of times, each time we're galling than the time before.
[time=2050] Donald Barnhouse expounds on this point.
[time=2053] He says this, "And many a time there must have been the half concealed snort of humor at the incongruity of the name and the fact that there were no children to back up such a name.
[time=2062] Abram must have steeled himself for the question and the reply and having hated the situation with great bitterness.
[time=2069] Father of many, father of none, though nowhere stated as such, it seems safe to assume that the servants who heard the jokes and who saw Abram's embarrassment repeated the details with embroidered variations.
[time=2080] It was, as you know, a world of cloth and goat skins where all lived in tents and where there was little privacy for the eye and none in the realm of the ears.
[time=2090] There must have been endless conversations on the subject. Was he sterile? Was it Abraham or Sarah that was sterile?
[time=2098] Was he really a full man? Yes, the great patriarch. His word was law. He had a multitude of cattle and many servants, yet he had no children.
[time=2108] And his name? Father of many. Following the promises of God has never been easy.
[time=2120] It's not unlike God to expect you to believe in him even though there is little circumstantial evidence to support his word.
[time=2128] To believe the word of God over your own experience and your own reason and even the laws of nature for Abraham,
[time=2136] you remember that the Lord allowed the timetable to run out and they were forty years waiting for Isaac and in that process Sarah had gone beyond the time of bearing children.
[time=2149] So had Abraham. His pro-creative powers had gone. But somehow in this man these physiological facts did not diminish his ability to believe and to reckon the word of God, to have faith.
[time=2165] It's amazing. It says in Romans 4 18 that he would hope against hope. He had hope against hope. In other words he had hope in a situation where there was from a human vantage point absolutely no basis for hope. Made him a fool.
[time=2182] But he still hoped. And of course you know what happened after Isaac finally did come long after they had passed the age of child bearing by a miracle of God.
[time=2194] God asked him to take the son of the covenant of promise up onto a mountain and kill him. And Abraham knew it was only through Isaac that the covenant could be fulfilled.
[time=2204] So once again he is thrust into the horns of this dilemma. Do I believe God or do I believe my own reason and my own thought process and what makes sense to me?
[time=2214] And of course you know he obeyed and lifted a knife. And what is so unbelievable about this is that Abraham had no witness or understanding or teaching had never heard or seen God raise anybody from the dead.
[time=2230] The doctrine of the resurrection had not been introduced to the world as far as we know. He had absolutely no basis to think that somehow God could raise this young boy from the dead.
[time=2243] Without that ever being taught all he knew was God told me that I would be the father of many nations and though this is the only one through whom those nations can come he is now telling me to kill the boy so he must.
[time=2257] He concocts it out of his own mind. He must be able to raise him from the dead. That's what Hebrews 11 says.
[time=2263] That Abraham knew and believed that God could raise his son from the dead and so he lifts the knife.
[time=2270] It's an awesome display of faith believing the word of God over our own experience, our own reason and even the laws of nature.
[time=2285] Of course if you would turn to Romans 4 verse 19 he has applauded and lifted up through the centuries for his courage to do this.
[time=2298] 40 years they waited. The timetable had run out for their sparing children. Look at it verse 19 and without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body now as good as dead since he was about 100 years old.
[time=2312] And the deadness of Sarah's womb yet with respect to the promise of God he did not waver in unbelief but drew strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully assured that what he had promised he was able also to perform.
[time=2329] That's an amazing thing. For Abraham it was faith because he was looking forward for God to fulfill a promise that he'd already made.
[time=2339] For you and I it's the word reckon because we've got to believe that what God said he's already done he's done.
[time=2345] It's the different side of the same coin. Faith looks forward. Reckon looks back believing that what he said he's done in our life he's actually done even though our experience doesn't verify it as much as we would like.
[time=2358] Even though our feelings don't confirm it even though our reasoning doesn't confirm it he said he's done it.
[time=2364] He says we've been baptized into Christ Jesus. He said the old self was crucified. He said the body of sin has been done away with.
[time=2376] Amazing. Interesting footnote back in Romans 6 verse 11 about this word reckon or count or consider it's an imperatival verb which means it's a command.
[time=2393] Whenever you have an imperatival verb in scripture it's a command. Do you realize this is the first imperatival verb in the entire book?
[time=2404] What we've got here are five and a half chapters of some of the greatest writings in all of scripture and you can't find one command to do anything in Romans chapter 1, Romans chapter 2, Romans chapter 3, Romans chapter 4, Romans chapter 5.
[time=2420] You've got to get all the way to Romans chapter 6 verse 11 before he asks you to do one thing and all it is is believe.
[time=2428] I've done it all. You in Romans 1 you immoral people who suppress the truth of God and unrighteousness and hold down the witness of God from creation.
[time=2438] I've turned you over I've turned you over I've turned you over and you you moral men in Romans chapter 2 who judge others but do the same in your own heart and find yourself self righteous.
[time=2448] You legalists you Pharisees you too are damned under sin and then he wraps the whole thing up in Romans chapter 3 and says everybody's accountable to God.
[time=2458] Before you can get out of Romans chapter 3 he says but there's justification by faith.
[time=2463] And then he describes that faith in Romans chapter 4 as illustrated in Abraham and then in chapter 5 he talks about the peace that's ours because we've been justified and then in Romans chapter 6 and by the way you're free from sin.
[time=2475] You don't have to live in it any longer. Let me tell you why you've been baptized into Jesus the old self is crucified the body of sin is done away with.
[time=2483] Now let me ask you to do something. This is it. This is my first command to you as a believer in the book of Romans.
[time=2491] Believe me. It's amazing isn't it that he should have to ask us. Who else are we going to believe ourselves the world Satan.
[time=2503] He says at the moment of temptation when your world is coming apart and you find within you this raging burning fire in the flesh to consume what is there for you when God feels unreal and Satan has filled your soul not with the hatred of God but the forgetfulness of God.
[time=2520] The lust has aroused and it envelops the mind and the will and deepest darkness and the powers of clear discrimination and thought are taken from you reckon.
[time=2530] Believe God. Not anything else that what he has said about you is true.
[time=2541] Duty follows doctrine doesn't it. Duty follows doctrine. Five and a half chapters of doctrine and then duty based upon what I have done God says I'll now ask you to do something in return.
[time=2555] He's always the leader. He's always the initiator. He always provides the way God gives the resources first and then says now use those resources and live an obedient Godly life.
[time=2568] That's an awesome God. Paul moves on in his argument. The nose of verse 3 and down through verse 9 and then this word consider and reckon which directs itself to our heart and the capacity of faith to believe God and now to the will in verse 13.
[time=2584] Let's start in 11 and work down to verse 13 so we get the context. Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus, verse 12.
[time=2594] Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey its lusts and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness.
[time=2606] But present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
[time=2618] Verse 14 for sin shall not be master over you. For you are not under the law but grace.
[time=2628] Wonderful theme of grace. Look at verse 13 do not go on presenting or offering the members of your body to sin. It's time to make a choice.
[time=2639] Knowing all that we know is true about us in Christ. Believing what we believe about that and saying no I refuse to believe my reason and my experience I choose to believe what God has said about me but still there is choice.
[time=2652] Am I going to indulge in sin or am I going to say no? Is it the path of righteousness or the path of unrighteousness?
[time=2659] And in so we present our members, the members of our body.
[time=2664] Would you turn with me to Romans 12 where that same theme comes out loud and clear all over again?
[time=2672] Romans 12 verses 1 and 2 very familiar passage where he urges us I beg I plead all that is within me cries out for you therefore brethren by the mercies of God to present your members.
[time=2686] Excuse me your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=2694] Do you realize that when you and I follow that pattern as it's laid out in Romans chapter 6 and present our bodies as a living sacrifice as it says here we are worshiping God in that?
[time=2704] We don't have to wait for Sunday morning to get a shave and a shower and a tie and a coat and come in here and sing praises as wonderful as this is.
[time=2711] God has designed our very life our very existence as we deny our flesh and obey him to be an active worship.
[time=2719] As you work in the workplace as you work at home as you make the choices you make when you honor and obey him you worship him.
[time=2726] Worship is not confined to the walls of the sanctuary it emanates from the sanctuary of your heart and it turns every moment of life into an active vibrant worship experience of the true and living God.
[time=2741] He goes on in verse 2 do not be conformed do not be conformed to this world.
[time=2748] The word conformed is an actor's word it describes taking a pose that really isn't you and the idea is an actor who gets up in the morning and finds out that he got a part to play in the big play that he's always wanted to play.
[time=2760] And is very happy inside about that couldn't be happier it's the breakthrough of a lifetime the guy's ecstatic but he shows up and finds that his part is to be sad and discouraged so he takes a pose he conforms to something that he isn't.
[time=2775] He's excited but the part demands he's depressed and so he plays it.
[time=2780] When you and I sin when you and I fail to present the members of our body as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God and we involve ourselves in sin we are posing we are conforming to something that isn't us.
[time=2795] It's not the new us suppose it's not who we really are but then he goes on in verse 2 not to be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind the word transform metamorphis moving from one stage to a next and becoming more of what we already are.
[time=2813] Kind of like a polywalk becoming a frog moving along that process and every day he becomes more of what he already is you and I are to be involved in this choice process of presenting our bodies a living and a holy sacrifice to God stripping away our conformity our pose our hypocrisy that looks like the world and allowing ourselves to become an expression more and more each and every day of what God has made us to be.
[time=2838] That's our Christian experience. That's so exciting ours is an experience of reality it's not a mind game it's not pretend God has made me new and now my life's quest is to become more and more of what he has already made me as I renew my mind.
[time=2855] And sometimes to be honest with you I almost wish it weren't a living sacrifice that's the hard part day after day moment after moment to continue to try to offer the body to offer the will and the mind and everything that is in me as a holy and a living sacrifice sometimes I wonder if it wouldn't just be easier to be in the hands of an enemy and say deny Jesus or die.
[time=2880] And I believe with all my heart I would not deny Jesus and then I'd just be done I'd be in heaven forever and no more this living sacrifice stuff I keep wanting to crawl off the altar and live another way.
[time=2892] It's difficult to live as a sacrifice but God has so enabled us to do it.
[time=2902] And speaking on our passage in Romans 6 the great Martin Lloyd Jones said this.
[time=2909] He used to speak of his life as if there were two fields separated by a road.
[time=2915] One field was the dominion of darkness and sin the residence of the Unmergenerate.
[time=2921] The other was the field of the beloved Son the kingdom of God and those fields were separated by a road and he was in the field of the beloved Son.
[time=2931] And he said this though I am now in the new field I still have trouble because Satan stands in the old field and yells orders at me.
[time=2942] I always seem to have a hard time because I keep hearing Satan across the road yelling orders at me though I am not under his dominion nor under the power of sin he has a very clever way of making me interested in what he's asking me to do.
[time=2960] Abraham Lincoln is remembered as the great emancipator.
[time=2966] He was a courageous man willing to stand in the gap to live and even die for freedom the freedom of slaves.
[time=2976] I believe it's likely he died without a full understanding of the gargantuan contribution he made to everything we consider right and good about the United States of America.
[time=2985] At points his life was tentative and lonely it was a path of misunderstanding and doubt and criticism.
[time=2994] His life eventually as you know came to end at the hands of an angry assassin.
[time=3002] Thousands of men had died in the battle for freedom.
[time=3006] Countless children had lost their fathers.
[time=3009] Hundreds of families had lost their possessions but finally they were the first of January 1863 the Emancipation Proclamation.
[time=3020] Slavery legally abolished.
[time=3027] Ultimately with the adoption of the 13th Amendment slavery was legally abolished.
[time=3033] Black slaves all across America were free.
[time=3037] Free at last.
[time=3039] And one would have expected these slaves to run off the plantations in their newfound freedom and have a drastically changed lifestyle.
[time=3047] Everything would have been different in our thinking.
[time=3051] In our imagination yet something very strange took place.
[time=3055] The majority of the slaves continued to live as slaves.
[time=3062] Being creatures of habit they were preferring the security of slavery to the risks of liberty.
[time=3069] The history books confirmed they continued to live virtually unchanged throughout the reconstruction period.
[time=3075] Free!
[time=3077] Legally free!
[time=3078] Yet no change.
[time=3080] Still slaves.
[time=3083] Chuck Swindall who makes this point so powerfully cites Shelby Foote, a noted expert and author on the Civil War.
[time=3090] The quote is this.
[time=3092] The Negro remained locked in a caste system of race etiquette as rigid as any he had known in formal bondage.
[time=3101] And every slave could repeat with equal validity what an Alabama slave had said when asked what he thought of the great emancipator whose proclamation had gone into effect.
[time=3113] He mumbled, "I don't know nothing about Abraham Lincoln except they say he sought us free."
[time=3125] And I don't know nothing about that either.
[time=3130] I don't know nothing about Abraham Lincoln except they say he sought us free.
[time=3135] And I don't know nothing about that either.
[time=3140] Christians even in the sanctuary today who could say the same of their Jesus and spiritual freedom.
[time=3147] I don't know nothing about Jesus except they say he sought us free.
[time=3154] But I don't know nothing about that either.
[time=3157] Living in bondage to sin when you're free.
[time=3162] In the time to live like it, to let go and begin to reckon what is true and based on that vast body of doctrine to begin to choose to present your body of living in a holy sacrifice so that you're no longer conformed to this world.
[time=3182] But transformed into the great and awesome thing that God has made you to be.
[time=3189] You know what I love about the book of Romans?
[time=3192] Right after Romans chapter 6 is Romans chapter 7.
[time=3197] Look at Romans 7 again.
[time=3199] This is an amazing thing.
[time=3203] I'm so thankful Romans 7 is in the Bible.
[time=3206] What you have is Paul, the great apostle, the man who wrote most of the New Testament, giant of the faith,
[time=3215] a man who was totally committed to obeying the Word of God, opening his heart and talking to us about his struggle.
[time=3224] And you can't find a chapter in all of scripture that portrays the struggle against sin with any more of a personal touch, an open vulnerability.
[time=3233] He admits that he sins and he cries out in hatred against it because it's not what he wants to do.
[time=3239] He joyfully concurs with the law of God in the inner man verse 22, but he sees this different law and the members of his body waging war against the law of his mind.
[time=3248] He feels as though he's a prisoner of the law of sin which is in his members.
[time=3251] He writes all that right after he's written Romans chapter 6 which declares him absolutely totally free.
[time=3257] And the Bible is a book for real people.
[time=3262] After he declares our emancipation proclamation, he's honest enough to involve our hearts and minds with his own struggle to live like it.
[time=3273] And I believe this is the mark of a deeply spiritual and mature Christian who honestly measures himself against God's standards.
[time=3281] I believe the more holy you become, the more you will relate to Romans chapter 7.
[time=3286] I believe the closer you get to God, the closer you walk with God, the more obedient you are, the more maturity you find in your life, the more the words of Romans 7 will ring true in your life.
[time=3295] I hate my sin, I hate my sin, wretched man that I am deliver me from this body of death.
[time=3304] It's the immature, fleshly, legalistic people who tend to live under the illusion that they measure up well to the standard of God.
[time=3314] It's the people who find no identity with Romans 7 who are spiritually immature.
[time=3321] As you walk with God, as you pursue him in your life and as you grow, you'll begin to feel the same feelings of Paul who cried out, "I am the least of the apostles.
[time=3330] I am the least of the saints," he said in another book.
[time=3333] And to Timothy, he marveled that God considered him worthy, putting me into service, me of all people, and that feeling of inadequacy and sin only grew with time.
[time=3345] And finally, as he wrote one of the last books that he ever wrote, the book of Corinthians, he said, "But by the grace of God I am what I am."
[time=3354] I'm a wretched, filthy sinner. The things that have happened in my life good are because this great and awesome God has done it in my life.
[time=3365] And for that, I will ever be thankful.
[time=3372] As we close, I want to caution the messages that have gone before, and you who have heard them.
[time=3380] These are wonderfully powerful, transforming truths. I believe they're to us from God, but sanctification.
[time=3391] We've been sharing with you music that we hope has inspired your heart and the message from God's word, a powerful message.
[time=3398] We hope that you have learned something from it and that your spiritual life is enriched by the Bible hour today.
[time=3405] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, we'd like to take a moment right now and just pray a prayer with you.
[time=3413] I hope that you'll join me in this prayer right now.
[time=3416] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I am that Jesus came to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3423] And I know that I've sinned against you and that I'm a sinner and I don't know how to go to heaven.
[time=3429] But today I know that if I trust you and you become my Savior, that I can have eternal life and dwell with you in heaven someday.
[time=3436] Please come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3442] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3445] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3450] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
