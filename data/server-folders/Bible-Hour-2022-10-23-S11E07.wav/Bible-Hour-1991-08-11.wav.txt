[time=0] This morning we're going to study a song that's number one on the charts.
[time=5] In fact, it's been number one for about 3,000 years.
[time=10] It was written by a simple shepherd.
[time=12] He was both a shepherd and the son of a shepherd and was later known as the Shepherd King of Israel.
[time=18] His name is David and the Psalm is the 23rd Psalm.
[time=22] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=24] I shall not want.
[time=39] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=45] Thank you for joining us.
[time=47] Pastor Moore's message today is entitled, "The Good Shepherd." The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=54] I shall not want.
[time=55] The 23rd Psalm is certainly one of the most familiar in the entire Bible.
[time=60] Perhaps it was the first message that you memorized.
[time=63] Join with Pastor Moore today as we learn some very timely truths from this old familiar passage.
[time=70] Find your Bible and have it open to Psalms 23.
[time=74] Before today's message we will be ministered to by special music from Keith and Starr Bratagam.
[time=80] We will hear Jesus, what a friend for sinners, and I need thee every hour.
[time=89] We're glad to welcome Peter Coby back from vacation.
[time=92] Let's join our worship service as Peter and the sanctuary choir begin our preparation for worship with the great hymn, "Great is Thy Faithfulness." "Great is Thy Faithfulness all by my Father.
[time=116] There is a shell of turning with thee.
[time=130] For Jesus, all by my precious, if we'll not, as our as we live, the forever will be.
[time=146] Great is Thy Faithfulness, great is Thy Faithfulness all by my Father in the verses I see.
[time=161] All I have made, Thy hand and fro my fill, great is Thy Faithfulness, more unto me."
[time=182] Summer and winter and springtime and harvest, sun, wood, and stars in their forces above.
[time=202] I live a nature in and in all withness, to thy great famefulness, mercy and love.
[time=226] I live a city where I be silent for you, I all be impressed, to cheer and to cry.
[time=247] I live a city where I be silent for you, I live a city where I be silent for you.
[time=263] I live a city where I be silent for you, great is Thy Faithfulness, more to my Father in the verses I see.
[time=277] All I have made, Thy hand and fro my fill, great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness.
[time=299] Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness.
[time=310] Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness.
[time=338] Great is the faithfulness of the Lord. We continue to worship Him as we sing a familiar Him that we love to sing at Black Hawk. How great is Thou art? Him number four, please we'll sing verses
[time=349] one, three and four of Him number four.
[time=379] I speak the song of the name of the Holy Father. I love the love we love to sing.
[time=391] Let's sing for the song of the City of God's King.
[time=397] I'll read Thou more, I'll read Thou more.
[time=403] Let's sing for the song of the City of God's King.
[time=532] Thank you very much. You may be seated, and thank you for your good singing today.
[time=537] It's been nearly a year now since Keith and Starr Brodigam have taken on other responsibilities
[time=543] in another city, but we often have them come back and sing and minister to us.
[time=547] We love them. We're so appreciative of their music and they're here to minister to us today.
[time=552] Let's listen to Keith and Starr Brodigam minister and music right now.
[time=577] [MUSIC - 192 seconds]
[time=785] [APPLAUSE]
[time=789] Hello and thank you for joining us today for the Bible Hour.
[time=793] It's an indeed a privilege to be back on the set here with our pastor Russell Moore.
[time=797] Good morning Russ. It's nice to be with you again.
[time=799] Good morning Pete. Welcome back. What was the highlight of your vacation?
[time=803] Well we really did have a good time. Russ starting in Southern California and visiting some relatives there and then going to see my folks in Northern California.
[time=811] But an opportunity to see some of the special sites. I guess Hearst Castle up in kind of the middle of the state, little north of the middle.
[time=819] Beautiful, beautiful, former residents of Hearst and really quite a magnificent monument to his success.
[time=829] It was a wonderful time. Another highlight, we were traveling through Kansas and I was fumbling with the radio and finally found a station and listened to this music.
[time=840] And the song "Gentle Shepherd" was being played. Well that's really nice and at the end of it it said and you've just been listening to the Sounds Alive.
[time=847] Sounds Alive was a former group that we had here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=851] It's really great to be involved with Black Hawk and know that not only on Sunday mornings here in our worship service but through tapes and records and television we're able to reach out to other people.
[time=864] And that was exciting for me. Well that's good. We're glad you're back. We missed you.
[time=867] Well thank you. I understand today through the information that we received that you're going to begin on that great Psalm Psalm 23. What a marvelous text it is.
[time=878] Well 23rd Psalm has got to be one of the most quoted Psalms of all. If anybody knows the verse of scripture it's probably "The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want."
[time=887] And I have had an absolutely thrilling time this week studying it and I don't think we'll even begin to share all that would be deserved of this Psalm this week.
[time=896] We'll probably turn into a two or a three week series and we'll just like sheep sometimes when they find real green pastures they slow down and graze and take a good long time so we'll be spending some time there.
[time=907] It is a marvelous passage. It's been used in music innumerable times and is wonderful. We look forward to that ministry.
[time=916] So even in times of grief often we'll have that passage read at a funeral or whatever and even my family now with my uncle being gravely ill is going through that time of facing death again.
[time=930] And we've read some of those scriptures already in preparation for that death and we can't totally prepare.
[time=936] We know that God is our shepherd and will lead us in some of those dark times too. And we have a book that talks about that.
[time=943] It's good grief and we've introduced it to the people last week. It's a tremendous little book that helps us deal with significant loss in our lives.
[time=952] The book begins with understanding that many times we'll just go into shock when something difficult and unsuspecting comes into our lives and then the emotions begin to be expressed.
[time=963] Whether it's depression and then the physical evidence of the emotional trauma begins to show signs and eventually we begin to feel a real sense of guilt that somehow this whole thing has happened because of us.
[time=975] And finally we make it back to a place where we have hope in God and where we can look forward to the future and affirm the reality of what actually happened.
[time=985] It's a tremendous tool and if you're struggling with the loss or the grief of something or someone important in your life, we'd love for you to write us and we'll send this to you.
[time=997] Go ahead and write us at the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1007] Thank you Russ and I hope that there will be some people today that will write for that book and it will be an encouragement for them.
[time=1013] I know Russ last week you had our school administrator Steve Longrake on and I love our school.
[time=1020] Our kids are almost through. I have one more boy that's in, it's a junior but our kids have all attended Black Hawk Baptist School and there are a few openings.
[time=1030] So if you'd like to write or call the school today, you can call the school at 493 7400 and inquire as to the openings that are available in the various classes and I hope that you can join with us.
[time=1043] It's a marvel of school and we want you to be a part of it.
[time=1047] And once we've had a good summer, when I came back on Tuesday morning daily vacation Bible school where over 400 kids running around, I talked to a number of teachers and they were just excited about the ministry.
[time=1058] And we've had a good summer on Wednesday nights with special guests and we're delighted for that.
[time=1064] And we're looking forward to the fall. As you know we're planning to bring a friend Sunday, what is it? September 15th.
[time=1071] And that's just almost like a back in the saddle Sunday if you will to get everybody back in the habit of church and coming out and being a part of the ministry here at Black Hawk.
[time=1080] And if you're in the practice of watching our television ministry and you don't have a local church that you regularly attend,
[time=1087] I would love for you to come by and visit with us September 15th.
[time=1091] It's friend day at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1094] We'd love to have them come and join with us if you watch the Bible regularly.
[time=1098] Take a special opportunity to come and fellowship with us in the sanctuary.
[time=1103] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our program with our special guest, Keith and Star Broadingham.
[time=1108] Great friends of ours are going to be ministering in music and then we'll have the message from our pastor.
[time=1113] Stay with us please for the remainder of our broadcast.
[time=1117] [MUSIC - 69 seconds]
[time=1192] [MUSIC] In joy or pain [MUSIC] Come quickly and abide [MUSIC] When life is vain [MUSIC] I need thee, oh I need thee [MUSIC] Every hour I need thee [MUSIC] Oh bless me now my savior [MUSIC] I come to thee [MUSIC] I need thee every hour [MUSIC] Most holy one [MUSIC] Oh make me thine indeed [MUSIC] Most blessed son [MUSIC] I need thee, oh I need thee [MUSIC] Every hour I need thee [MUSIC] Oh bless me now my savior [MUSIC] I come to thee [MUSIC] Oh bless me now my savior [MUSIC] I come to thee [MUSIC] Mmm ♪
[time=1313] (gentle piano music) - Thank you, Keith.
[time=1321] The tune that Scott is playing is
[time=1328] come out of the heart and mind of a talented and popular musician and vocalist by the name of Brian Adams.
[time=1336] In fact, this song is number one in the nation this week.
[time=1341] It's the song everybody seems to be listening to and buying.
[time=1345] It's entitled Everything I Do, I Do It For You.
[time=1349] The lyrics powerfully speak of a man's unfailing
[time=1355] sacrificial love for his sweetheart.
[time=1357] The chorus reads this way, don't tell me it's not worth trying for.
[time=1363] Don't tell me it's not worth dying for.
[time=1366] Everything I do, I do it for you.
[time=1370] Who wouldn't be pulled in by these lyrics?
[time=1374] Which of us can't imagine with a great longing?
[time=1378] The desire to have a perfect person look deeply into our soul and say I know you and I love you.
[time=1385] Which of us doesn't feel in some small part of our being that we were made for such a love?
[time=1397] Brian Adams has made a career out of writing songs such as this.
[time=1401] He's made millions and millions of dollars touching through melody and lyric that vacuum inside of each and every human being that can be filled ultimately only by God.
[time=1414] Augustine described it this way, oh God thou hast made us for thyself and our souls are restless searching till they find their rest in thee.
[time=1427] How long will the song stay number one?
[time=1429] A week, maybe two weeks, maybe three months if it really catches on.
[time=1434] For the next two Sunday mornings, we're going to talk about a song that has been among the most popular of all songs, probably the most well-known song of all time for nearly 3,000 years.
[time=1448] The writer of that song also knew the longings of the heart, even better than Brian Adams, because the writer of this song had come into a relationship with the perfect person, Jesus.
[time=1463] He was able to look deeply into his eyes and say, David, not only are you worth trying for, you're worth dying for.
[time=1473] Would you take your Bibles with me this morning and open to Psalm chapter 23, the 23rd Psalm?
[time=1486] Yeah.
[time=1487] Follow along as I read.
[time=1493] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1497] I shall not want.
[time=1499] He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[time=1503] He leads me beside quiet waters.
[time=1506] He restores my soul and guides me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake.
[time=1511] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for thou art with me.
[time=1518] Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[time=1521] Thou dost prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[time=1525] Thou hast anointed my head with oil, my cup overflows.
[time=1529] Surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[time=1539] One writer describes the 23rd Psalm this way.
[time=1544] It is probably one of the most read and appreciated portions in the entire Bible.
[time=1549] Though written by David 3000 years ago, this short poem has never been improved upon or surpassed in any language.
[time=1556] To our day, it remains a sweet singing night and gale of the soul, a majestic oak of the trees of faith, the Mount Everest of radiant devotion.
[time=1565] What handles Messiah is to music and hunts, light of the world is to art.
[time=1570] The 23rd Psalm is to mankind.
[time=1575] Charles Haddon Spurgeon said it this way, "This pilgrim has sent to speak in every language of the globe.
[time=1582] It is charmed more griefs to rest than all the philosophy of the world.
[time=1587] It is remanded to their dungeon, more felon thoughts, more black doubts, more thieving sorrows than there are sands on the seashore.
[time=1595] It is comforted the noble host of the poor.
[time=1597] It is sung courage to the army of the disappointed.
[time=1601] It is poured balm and consolation into the heart of sick, of captives and dungeons, of widows in their pinching griefs, of orphans in their loneliness.
[time=1610] Dying soldiers have died easier as it was read to them.
[time=1614] Gastly hospitals have been illuminated.
[time=1616] It has visited the prisoner and broken his chains.
[time=1619] And like Peter's angel, let him forth an imagination and sung him back to his home again.
[time=1625] It has made the dying Christian slave freer than his master and consoled those whom dying.
[time=1631] He left behind mourning not so much that he was gone as because they were left behind and could not go too.
[time=1638] All of this written by a simple shepherd boy
[time=1644] who was both a shepherd and the son of a shepherd and who later became known as the shepherd king of Israel, David.
[time=1652] And though he never bothered to give his song a title, others have attempted.
[time=1657] One has entitled it David's Heavenly Pastoral by virtue of its final phrase and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, claiming the song to have been filled with celestial notes more fitted for eternal mansions than for the dwelling here below the clouds.
[time=1673] Another has entitled it David's praise to divine diligence.
[time=1679] As the poem carefully recounts the manner in which the good shepherd spares no pains for the welfare of his sheep.
[time=1686] It is the great shepherd who constantly guides by his spirit feeds us with his word.
[time=1691] And as Hebrew seven says, ever lives to make intercession for his saints.
[time=1696] For us it will remain just the 23rd Psalm.
[time=1699] Interestingly, however, if you'll look again at the Psalm, there is no petition.
[time=1705] Nowhere in the Psalm does David ask for anything or request or beg or make petition that God should give him something.
[time=1711] Instead, it's just one long single statement of praise.
[time=1715] Instead he affirms the loving care of his great and awesome God and he does that affirming by borrowing from a relationship.
[time=1726] That relationship between the shepherd and his sheep.
[time=1729] While in other places in scripture, the loving care of God is communicated to us in somewhat didactic propositional truth.
[time=1737] Romans eight, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[time=1741] Matthew 28, for lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the age.
[time=1746] Here in this Psalm, the same truth, the loving care of God is communicated powerfully and wonderfully through a relationship that of a shepherd to his sheep.
[time=1757] David was familiar with the long, hard, endless hours of work to provide for his fold.
[time=1764] The repeated need for careful examination of each and every sheep and the constant vigil of protection from wolves and dogs and cougars and severe weather.
[time=1776] So the driving theme of the psalm, the good shepherd and his loving care for the sheep.
[time=1783] Much of the strength and the power and the meaning of the psalm is in some way hidden from us because we are not as familiar with the role of a shepherd and the characteristics of sheep as we ought to be.
[time=1800] As such, we would not know what was immediately apparent to David and to the simple nomadic contemporaries who would have read and sung his song.
[time=1812] Divine revelation is often bound up in the natural.
[time=1816] Jesus, the master teacher, always illustrating from his surroundings.
[time=1821] He spoke of the sower and the seed, the weed and the tears, the leaven and the loaf, the mustard seed to name but a few.
[time=1827] The vast majority of us, we are city dwellers.
[time=1830] We live in the man-made environment and as such, there are challenging hurdles to be crossed before we'll know fully what David had in his mind in this unique and powerfully loving and caring relationship between the shepherd and his sheep.
[time=1844] For much of that background information, that vital stuff of the shepherd and his sheep, we will lean heavily on a contemporary shepherd, one who has in fact shepherded sheep and knows from firsthand experience and who is also a believer, a man by the name of Philip Keller who has written a powerful book on the 23rd Psalm entitled A Shepherd's Look at the 23rd Psalm.
[time=1865] It's not a long book and if you don't have it, I highly recommend it to you.
[time=1868] You'll find it compelling.
[time=1870] The Psalm begins with a summary statement in verse one.
[time=1874] Look at it there, the Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1877] I shall not want.
[time=1879] And frankly, David could have stopped right there.
[time=1881] Nothing else is needed.
[time=1883] In fact, the rest of the Psalm is only an explanation of what that one first verse describes.
[time=1888] The Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want.
[time=1892] But for our purposes, we might divide the Psalm into three parts.
[time=1896] First, the relationship, then the rest, the Lord is my shepherd, the relationship, the rest I shall not want.
[time=1905] And then the following verses two through six represent the resources of the shepherd.
[time=1909] We begin then with the relationship described.
[time=1914] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=1916] It's interesting.
[time=1918] Nowhere in the Psalm is the word sheep used.
[time=1923] We're just assumed to be that.
[time=1925] He is the shepherd, we are the sheep.
[time=1927] And as appropriate as it might be to call Jesus a shepherd and in fact, the good shepherd, it is equally appropriate for us to be referred to as sheep.
[time=1935] Sheep are remarkably weak, defenseless and foolish animals.
[time=1944] Suffering from an acute case of mob instinct driven by fear and timidity coupled with the unique sense of stubbornness and stupidity.
[time=1952] That's who we are, we're the sheep.
[time=1954] I think it describes us well.
[time=1957] But the emphasis of the Psalm remains on the shepherd himself.
[time=1960] The Lord is my shepherd and because the Lord is the one who shepherds me I shall not want.
[time=1965] David knew well that the lot in the life of a particular sheep depended heavily upon the type of shepherd who shepherded it.
[time=1974] Some were gentle and kind and intelligent, brave and selfless in their devotion to the flock.
[time=1981] Yet under another shepherd sheep would struggle at times they would starve and suffer endless hardship.
[time=1987] The stock of such men were always thin and weak and riddled with disease and parasites.
[time=1993] Philip Keller describes one, one sheepman who owned a farm next to his own, he says this.
[time=2000] He was not concerned about the condition of his sheep.
[time=2002] His land was neglected.
[time=2004] He gave little or no time to his flock, letting them pretty well forage for themselves as best they could, both summer and winter.
[time=2010] They fell prey to dogs and cougars and rustlers.
[time=2014] Every year these poor creatures were forced to gnaw away at bare brown fields and impoverished pastures.
[time=2020] Every winter there was a shortage of nourishing hay and wholesome grain to feed the hungry use.
[time=2025] Shelter to safeguard and protect the suffering sheep from storms and blizzards was scanty and inadequate.
[time=2031] They had only the polluted muddy water to drink.
[time=2035] There had been a lack of salt and other trace minerals needed to offset the sickly pastures in their thin, weak and diseased condition these poor sheep were a pathetic sight.
[time=2044] Sounds a lot like the people in the world who don't have Jesus for their shepherd, doesn't it?
[time=2052] In Ezekiel chapter 36, maybe you'd turn there with me.
[time=2059] God through the prophet Ezekiel describes the unworthy shepherd or the bad shepherd or the shepherd who does not really care for his sheep, who is more of a hireling, if you will, that is in it only for the money and if there's more there, they'll take it.
[time=2073] Ezekiel chapter 34, God brings a rebuke.
[time=2076] The word woe is to curse.
[time=2079] God is cursing these shepherds for their mismanagement of the flock of God, namely the nation of Israel.
[time=2085] Ezekiel 34.
[time=2089] Then the word of the Lord came to me saying, "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to thee shepherds, thus says the Lord God woe shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves should not the shepherds feed the flock." You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock.
[time=2109] Those who are sick, you have not strengthened and diseased, you have not healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you sought for the lost, but with force and with severity you have dominated them and they were scattered for lack of a shepherd and they became food for every beast of the field and were scattered.
[time=2130] My flock wandered through all the mountains and on every high hill and my flock was scattered over all the face of the earth and there was no one to search or seek for them.
[time=2141] Therefore you shepherds hear the words of the Lord and then he goes on to describe his curse.
[time=2148] Jesus is nowhere reflective of that kind of shepherding.
[time=2153] In fact, John 10 describes him as the good shepherd and says he's the good shepherd because he is willing not to take the life of another sheep or of one of the sheep for his own satisfaction of his lusts but instead to give his own life.
[time=2169] Jesus exemplifies the epitome of a good shepherd because he will go the distance to the point that he will even give his own life and shed his own blood in the protection and the provision of his sheep.
[time=2180] And such has been the case for you and for me if you know Jesus Christ.
[time=2185] And though the order of the psalms is not inspired they are often intriguing.
[time=2190] Would you go back with me now to the psalms and look at Psalm 22 the one that directly proceeds the 23rd Psalm and realize that even in that psalm we are reminded that the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[time=2204] Says in Psalm 22 this is another one written by David.
[time=2207] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[time=2211] You remember those words, Eli, Eli Lamasabachthani that Jesus cried out on the cross just before he gave up his spirit and his sacrificial death for you and for me.
[time=2220] He quoted this psalm.
[time=2224] And look at the description of the death over in verses 14 and following.
[time=2228] "I am poured out like water.
[time=2230] All my bones are out of joint.
[time=2232] My heart is like wax.
[time=2233] It is melted within me.
[time=2234] My strength is dried up like a pot sure.
[time=2236] And my tongue cleaves to my jaws.
[time=2238] And thou dost lay me in the dust of death." It's amazing, the description and how it parallels the experience of the Lord.
[time=2249] Verse 16, "For dogs have surrounded me.
[time=2251] A band of evil doers has encompassed me.
[time=2254] They pierced my hands and my feet.
[time=2255] I count all my bones.
[time=2257] They look, they stare at me.
[time=2259] They divide my garments among them.
[time=2261] And for my clothing, they cast lots." It's an amazing truth and it falls right in front of the 23rd Psalm.
[time=2271] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=2274] I don't know who shepherds you today, but there are only two choices ultimately.
[time=2280] You're either shepherd by God in the good shepherd of Jesus or you are shepherded by Satan.
[time=2285] And if you are here with us this morning and you're being shepherded by Satan, you have found the wrong one.
[time=2292] He will not provide for you.
[time=2294] He will do what the shepherds of Ezekiel 34 do and strip you and take from you all that God would have for you.
[time=2303] Satan is described as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.
[time=2310] And he presents life in this earth as a very appealing and attractive notion.
[time=2317] And yet it is death.
[time=2319] There is nothing to it.
[time=2320] There is no substance to it other than death itself.
[time=2324] He'll destroy your life.
[time=2326] He'll ravage you.
[time=2327] He'll use you.
[time=2328] And there is an alternative, the person of Jesus Christ, who instead will lay his own life down for you and guide you and lead you to the place of rest.
[time=2339] It's as if David cries out here, this is not just any shepherd, this is the Lord, the one who will one day die for my sins as he looked forward to the coming Messiah.
[time=2351] And as you and I look backwards to what has already been done, he will wash me, cleanse me, and give up his life sacrificially.
[time=2358] It's interesting there here, he says that he is my shepherd and that seems to be so powerful in his thinking.
[time=2366] It's not a generic term.
[time=2367] It's not everybody's shepherd.
[time=2370] He doesn't say here, the Lord is the shepherd of the world at large and leads forth the multitude as his flock.
[time=2377] The notion of the universal fatherhood of God that all who are born are somehow under the protection of a gracious loving father and that regardless of what they do with Jesus Christ, they'll, we all end up in the same place.
[time=2387] That's nowhere taught in scripture.
[time=2389] We are born the sons of Satan and shepherded by him and destroyed and ravaged in his presence and in his power.
[time=2398] That's only as we come to know Jesus Christ that we have a true heavenly father in God and can come under the shepherding care of Jesus Christ.
[time=2407] David is saying if he be shepherd to no one else,
[time=2414] he is shepherd to me, he cares for me, he watches over me, he preserves me and as such I shall not want.
[time=2424] Expresses here in utterly contented heart in the good shepherd's care.
[time=2432] The good shepherd finds no greater reward, no deeper satisfaction than that of seeing his sheep properly cared for.
[time=2440] They need to be well fed, safe and flourishing under his carer, he cannot rest.
[time=2445] He works hard to ensure they have the finest grazing, the richest pastor, ample winter feed and clean water.
[time=2451] He will spare himself no pains to provide shelter from storms, protection from ruthless enemies and the disease and parasites to which sheep are so susceptible.
[time=2462] From early dawn until late at night, the utterly selfless shepherd is alert to the welfare of his flock, that's our Jesus.
[time=2471] David wants us to grab ahold of the kind of work and industry and faithfulness and care about our Lord Jesus Christ which he knew as a shepherd.
[time=2482] Keller describes a good shepherd in contrast to his bad one.
[time=2488] Says this, with practiced searching, sympathetic eye, the shepherd examines the sheep to see that they are fit and content and able to be on their feet.
[time=2500] In an instant he can tell if they have been molested during the night, whether any are ill or if there are some which requires special attention.
[time=2508] Repeatedly through the day he casts his eye over the flock to make sure that all is well.
[time=2513] Nor even at night is he oblivious to their needs, he sleeps as it were with one eye and both ears open, ready at the least sign of trouble to leap up and protect his own.
[time=2524] He knows all about their lives from morning until night.
[time=2528] It's the same as what the scripture says in another place, instead of sheep it's a lion.
[time=2534] The lion is nowhere characteristic of weakness or of need, of a shepherd, he's the king of beasts.
[time=2542] The young lions do not lack and suffer hunger, but they that, excuse me, the young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.
[time=2553] So the contrast is even made there.
[time=2556] Whether we view ourselves as sheep, as oftentimes the scripture does or as people with minds that can think and set purpose and have strength and can pursue much like the lion in either situation lest the Lord Jesus is our shepherd, lest the Lord Jesus is the one who gives us strength we will want.
[time=2573] But they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.
[time=2577] So first a relationship.
[time=2582] A relationship between a shepherd and a sheep.
[time=2584] One that is not casual, Jesus is not viewed here as a hireling who merely takes care for money and for ulterior motives, but out of the goodness of his own heart and a bounding love for which he would die, he shepherds us.
[time=2597] It's good to be reminded of that, isn't it?
[time=2602] Our world doesn't always look like that.
[time=2605] Our day to day doesn't always bear the immediate truth of this scripture out to us.
[time=2609] We are oftentimes confronted with the reality that our children are sick, our bank account is broke, we've lost a job, we don't like the one we have.
[time=2622] We struggle with our relationship with our spouse.
[time=2627] Somehow the words of this page don't always make it into our minds and our hearts and the hustle and bustle of a given day, but it's nice, isn't it, just to stop and say, you know something?
[time=2638] In fact, the truth is the Lord is my shepherd.
[time=2640] I shall not want.
[time=2643] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=2647] Hopefully even maybe to picture him with a staff in the shepherd's cloak with his rod standing by your bed watching over you.
[time=2662] He loves you, he cares for you.
[time=2664] It brings us to our second point, this idea of the rest of the good shepherd.
[time=2670] I shall not want.
[time=2675] The world, many people in the world, have a lot more than we have, especially in the way of material things, temporal blessings.
[time=2685] But you know, regardless of how much they have, they remain impoverished in spirit.
[time=2691] They're broke.
[time=2692] They're shriveled in soul.
[time=2693] Their life is typically and characteristically unhappy.
[time=2696] When you get involved with them, you find that out.
[time=2701] Typically joyless, happy at points.
[time=2705] There are a lot of thrills, a lot of gimmicks, but joyless people held in the iron grip of a ruthless master, the wrong shepherd.
[time=2713] And though the world applauds their success, though they may be noted as famous people and have big labels and drive great cars and be in positions of great power.
[time=2725] You know, in reality, they remain utterly insecure in their soul, or terrified inside, bankrupt with little character and spiritual values.
[time=2737] They remain restless, unsettled, covetous, greedy, wanting this and wanting that, never ever really able to come to the place, even for a brief moment, as David has, to where he can say with the Lord as my shepherd, I shall not want.
[time=2752] It's interesting, the ability to say that is as much a choice as anything.
[time=2757] You and I bring with us to church this morning, oftentimes polluted mind, you know?
[time=2765] We begin to think, gee, if I only had this, if I only had this, if we were to take a minute pause and get out a piece of paper and write down, what would you put down?
[time=2774] If I only had this, then my life would be as if I had a good shepherd.
[time=2778] Then I'd have life, then I'd be happy, then I'd be satisfied, then I'd be content.
[time=2784] If I only had this, severe case of the if I only hads, and yet the truth is so overwhelming that God wants to give us character.
[time=2797] God wants to build a character of life and a virtue that is priceless.
[time=2806] And some of us will have much material blessing and praise God for that.
[time=2810] Others of us won't.
[time=2812] Some of us will have sick children and others of us won't.
[time=2815] Some of us will lose our jobs and others of us won't, but in all of it, what he is laboring to do, and I love this passage when he says that he's given us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[time=2829] Of course, I'm over here in Second Peter for just a minute, you don't have to come.
[time=2832] But after having said that, after having said, I have given you everything pertaining to life and godliness, we are now possessors of it.
[time=2840] Remarkable how it doesn't always feel that way.
[time=2843] He says, but go on now, and for this reason apply, and then these several character qualities, diligence, moral excellence, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love.
[time=2861] Do you realize that when those are in us and increasing it says, they render us neither useless, nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2868] These are the things that Christ can give us.
[time=2872] These are the things that Christ builds on in our life.
[time=2875] Having given us everything pertaining to life and godliness, everything that we need now to continue to live on this sin-cursed earth with all of its adverse circumstances and all of its disappointments.
[time=2884] In the middle of all of that, what God is really trying to do is build in us and refine in us a pure and righteous character.
[time=2892] And when we have that, and when that is our pursuit, with food and clothing, we shall be what?
[time=2900] Content.
[time=2901] What are we striving after?
[time=2904] What are we wanting?
[time=2905] What is it that we think will solve that which is within us, other than the shepherd himself, the spiritual resources that he gives us, and then his constant and diligent care over our life like a shepherd over his sheep to refine and to purify and to hone and to develop in us what is priceless?
[time=2924] Character and a pursuit of God.
[time=2927] You might turn with me to one New Testament passage in the book of Colossians.
[time=2933] This is a beautiful few little words in a row
[time=2940] that seem to speak a world of truth.
[time=2942] Colossians chapter two, verses nine and 10.
[time=2950] You remember that Paul in writing to the Colossians
[time=2956] is fighting some false doctrine.
[time=2958] People have come in to the assembly and begun to say that life can be found outside of Christ.
[time=2963] Life isn't the beginning and end in Christ.
[time=2966] There's another way to live.
[time=2968] There are some special techniques.
[time=2969] There are some things that if you'd just apply, you'd find the I shall not want in your life.
[time=2973] They are philosophy.
[time=2976] He combats legalism.
[time=2978] He combats mystical teaching.
[time=2979] He combats asceticism.
[time=2982] But you know, in fighting against all of these various worldly counterproductive mindsets, he never once really involves himself in a careful argument against philosophy or against asceticism or against mysticism.
[time=2997] And if you know the book of Colossians, you know that all he does against all of those is he just lifts Jesus up, just holds Jesus up.
[time=3003] He just says, you're struggling with philosophy.
[time=3005] Well, here's Jesus.
[time=3006] But look at what he does.
[time=3007] Look at who he is.
[time=3008] You're struggling with asceticism.
[time=3010] You think that's a proper and profitable way to live your life and self denial as if that would bring some I shall not want in your life.
[time=3015] No, no, instead of describing all that, he just lifts Jesus up.
[time=3018] And here he's doing that.
[time=3019] Colossians two, verses nine and 10.
[time=3022] For in him, all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form, he's got it all.
[time=3027] There's nowhere else to look.
[time=3028] Now, verse 10, and in him, you have been made, what?
[time=3033] Complete.
[time=3034] You've been made complete.
[time=3037] When you have Jesus, you have everything.
[time=3041] There's nothing else.
[time=3045] The Lord is my shepherd.
[time=3046] He is mine.
[time=3047] He has bought me.
[time=3049] I shall not want.
[time=3054] One of my favorite creatures from time to time to listen to is a man by the name of Ron Dunne.
[time=3058] I don't know if you're familiar with him.
[time=3060] He says this, Jesus doesn't give us peace.
[time=3063] He is our peace.
[time=3065] He doesn't give knowledge.
[time=3066] He is our knowledge.
[time=3068] He doesn't give wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[time=3073] He is all these things.
[time=3075] If we are hungry, he is the bread of life.
[time=3078] If we are thirsty, he is the fountain of living water.
[time=3082] If we are lost, he is the way.
[time=3085] If we are blind, he is the light.
[time=3088] If we are lonely, he is the friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
[time=3091] If we are dying, he is the resurrection and the life.
[time=3094] He is the way and what we find at the end of the way.
[time=3097] He is the door and what we find on the other side of the door.
[time=3100] He is the fountain and the water that flows from the fountain.
[time=3102] He is the cause of his own effect and the effect of his own cause.
[time=3105] He is the means and the ends.
[time=3110] When we have Jesus, we have everything.
[time=3112] Nothing that we could be wanting this morning.
[time=3114] Nothing that we could be hoping for or pursuing will give us anything that we do not already have.
[time=3119] And that is not the mitigate against the severity of some of our circumstances.
[time=3122] And I in no way mean to be little.
[time=3124] Those of you who are out of a job and whose children are sick and whose situations are most unpleasant.
[time=3130] But simply to call you back to a psalm that does not ask for anything because everything has already been given and to refocus that is that in Christ, who is my shepherd, who does know, who does care, he is not a delinquent shepherd.
[time=3144] He does not eat and feed off of us to his own delight, instead gives and sacrificially provides.
[time=3153] To be reminded, he stands over and keeps watch of us.
[time=3156] You know it's customary for a shepherd
[time=3166] when he gets his sheep to mark them.
[time=3169] Much like a cattleman would his cattle.
[time=3173] Only they of course would take a hot iron and brand the cattle, but they don't do that with sheep.
[time=3178] I guess that's because of all the wool.
[time=3181] Instead, they have a much different process and it seems as barbaric, they wrestle the sheep down to the ground and then put a chopping block under its ear, a piece of wood.
[time=3191] And then they take out a very sharp knife and they cut a notch of some sort into the ear.
[time=3196] And it becomes an identifying mark.
[time=3199] Whereby forever, that shepherd knows that's my sheep.
[time=3203] That's the one that's mine, I marked it, I own it.
[time=3206] And I'll die for it if necessary.
[time=3210] Well, when we think about the ways in which God has marked his own children in time, think back, David himself was a marked man, wasn't he?
[time=3219] He was marked by circumcision.
[time=3220] It was the sign of the covenant that too was painful and bloody and it was physical and it was a mark that said, "You are mine, I am in covenant with you." And unfortunately, over and over through the history of Israel that mark, which should have been a glorious reminder of a spiritual reality that we are obedient to the true and living God and he alone is ours, it was always reverting back to merely a physical, external thing and the people began to find a false hope in a physical mark.
[time=3252] And so God gave a different mark.
[time=3258] Turn with me to Galatians 6, this is interesting.
[time=3262] Paul, you know, in the book of Galatians, it's fighting just such legalism, just such an external approach to Christianity.
[time=3269] There are Judaizers who have crept into the church of Galatia and who are trying to divert people from a simple and true teaching of salvation by faith.
[time=3278] Pick it up in Galatians chapter six, verse 12.
[time=3284] Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised simply that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
[time=3295] In other words, they don't want to suffer because they're identified with Jesus.
[time=3299] So instead, they compel you to be circumcised.
[time=3303] Verse 13, for those who are circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
[time=3313] You become a notch, if you will, in their gun belt.
[time=3316] They don't really love you.
[time=3317] What they want is another convert, verse 14.
[time=3321] But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
[time=3329] For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creature, verse 16.
[time=3336] And those who will walk by this rule peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God.
[time=3343] Now, verse 17.
[time=3344] From now on, let no one cause trouble for me.
[time=3348] For I bear on my body.
[time=3351] What?
[time=3353] The brand marks of Jesus.
[time=3355] You know what these are?
[time=3358] These are the scars that are all over his body because he's been faithful to the commissioning of God and his life.
[time=3364] He's literally been beat up, whipped and stoned and thrown in prison and it shows on his physical body.
[time=3370] And he says they're my brand marks of Jesus.
[time=3373] Jesus has branded me.
[time=3374] Jesus has marked me in this way and I'm like Jesus because Jesus was branded as well.
[time=3379] He's got scars in his hands and scars in his feet.
[time=3382] The brand of love and what his love took him to in the cross.
[time=3385] It's an amazing perspective, isn't it?
[time=3389] To actually as a sheep desire or be willing to be branded, not wrestled to the ground as it were, but to literally say whatever it takes.
