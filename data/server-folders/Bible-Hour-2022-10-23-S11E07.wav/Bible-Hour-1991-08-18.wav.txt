[time=0] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[time=17] The twenty-third psalm, probably one of the most well-known portions in all of Scripture.
[time=23] Stay with us this morning as we study it and have an in-depth look at God's Word.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=47] Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] Today Pastor Moore will be bringing a second message from Psalm 23 entitled "The Good Shepherd."
[time=57] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[time=61] Sheaf are very dependent animals, dependent on their shepherd to lead them and to protect them from harm.
[time=68] What a beautiful picture of Christ is our good shepherd.
[time=72] Join with Pastor Moore today as we open our Bibles to psalm 23 and again study this very
[time=78] familiar passage.
[time=80] Before today's message we will be ministered to by special music from rejoice entitled
[time=86] how majestic is your name and a solo from Susan Toyrac's stump entitled "The Name Above
[time=93] All Names." As we prepare our hearts for today's message from the twenty-third psalm, let's join our worship service as the sanctuary choir begins our preparation for worship with "The
[time=106] King of Love, My Shepherd Is."
[time=135] The King of Love, My Shepherd Is, who is the greatest devil ever, I know that if I am his, and he is not forever.
[time=156] Where streams of living waters blow, my rats don't need the e-mail, and where the verdant
[time=171] that he drow includes the rest of the dead.
[time=185] And I am the one who is not me, and I am the shoulder gently laid, and only just, he brought me the rest, and we're the two.
[time=233] In this dark will I fill the will with thee, near or beside me, thy rise have my hunger still,
[time=254] I cross before you guide me.
[time=260] All stretched and tabled in my sight, I march and raise thee so well, and all the dreads are long denied.
[time=278] In which I come, or flow in, and show through all the days, the days I would best fail, and ever,
[time=294] Good Shepherd, we may I see, the great within my arms, forever so well, all the days, the mid-time, the best day I've ever,
[time=315] Good Shepherd, we may I take my grace with thee, thy house forever.
[time=330] All men, all men, all men.
[time=345] All men.
[time=361] Continue with that pastoral theme now as we sing 458, gentle shepherd, calm and lead us,
[time=369] that is our prayer today, 458.
[time=372] Gentle shepherd, all men, all men, all men, all men, all men.
[time=398] All men, all men, all men, all men, all men.
[time=431] Gentle shepherd, all men, all men, all men, all men.
[time=492] Gentle shepherd, all men, all men.
[time=517] All men, all men, all men, all men, all men, all men, all men, all men, all men.
[time=533] It's really a special time when we take songs that talk about the gentleness of our Savior and His goodness in helping us day to day.
[time=542] It's also unique to look at the Scriptures and see the various names of Jesus and our Lord
[time=548] that are given to Him and to say how wonderful it is to talk about the magnificence of the Lord
[time=554] and the mighty power and strength that He also has for us.
[time=558] Let's listen now as we rejoice things of that power and strength.
[time=575] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth.
[time=592] O Lord, we magnify Your name.
[time=597] Friends of His mighty love, O Lord God Almighty.
[time=609] O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth.
[time=621] O Lord, we pray His Your name.
[time=626] O Lord, we magnify Your name.
[time=632] Friends of His mighty God, O Lord God Almighty.
[time=639] O Lord, we pray His Your name.
[time=645] O Lord, we magnify Your name.
[time=650] Friends of His mighty God, O Lord God Almighty.
[time=659] O Lord, how majestic is Your name.
[time=665] O Lord, we pray His Your name.
[time=670] O Lord, how majestic is Your name.
[time=673] O Lord, we magnify Your name.
[time=676] Friends of His mighty God.
[time=682] O Lord, O Lord God Almighty.
[time=686] O majestic is Your name.
[time=689] Hello, and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=697] We're really glad that you tuned in.
[time=699] And Russ, we're in the mini-series of a very super-passage The Word of God, very well known, the 23rd Psalm.
[time=708] It's an amazing Psalm.
[time=710] Actually, I'd heard it a hundred thousand times at least it feels that way, but I'd never taken the time to study it until in preparation for this series.
[time=718] And I'm amazed at the loving concern of the good shepherd for his sheep.
[time=723] I had no idea that sheep were as needy as they are.
[time=727] I'm talking about animals.
[time=728] And the marvelous analogy and illustrations that flow out of their constant need for a shepherd
[time=735] and how it translates into our lives.
[time=737] I'm excited to share that.
[time=738] I can't tell you the number of soloists and choir numbers that have been arranged even today on that theme,
[time=745] but a marvelous passage of Scripture and I'm glad that the people can join in today and fellowship with us.
[time=752] If you've been watching the Bible Hour and have listened to Russell Moore speak a number of times now, but you've never been at Blackhawk Baptist Church, we want to give you a special invitation to Friend Day on September 15th.
[time=764] Our services are at 9.15 and 10.50.
[time=767] We'd love to have you come to the sanctuary and join with us in a live service here with the music
[time=773] and then the message from our new pastor, Russell Moore.
[time=776] We'd be glad to have you.
[time=777] Again, that's September 15th.
[time=780] Morning worship services at 9.15 and 10.50.
[time=784] Come and join with us.
[time=786] Russell, just before we began this interview here, we talked about yesterday in my time with our family
[time=793] and the death of my uncle, and what a great joy it was to sing how great thou art and even to look forward
[time=799] to the day when the Father tells us that he has promised to return for us because he's gone to prepare places
[time=806] and for us and need to know that my uncle lived a great life, loved the Lord and is with the Father.
[time=813] Even in times of grief there can be joy in our hearts, not always happiness, and certainly an amount of regret
[time=820] that we've lost a loved one, but the joy can still remain with us because of the Savior.
[time=825] I remember doing the funeral of my grandmother, just a frail little lady, and when she died I was there in the hospital
[time=834] with my mom and then my mom's dad, so we were kind of all there and watched her die, and it was an awesome moment
[time=841] to see life leave a body.
[time=843] But when you were sure of her salvation and you knew that somehow to be absent with the body is to be present
[time=849] with the Lord, there's a hope there that undergirds the hard reality of the loss involved.
[time=856] There are times perhaps in your life that you might have grief and you might need some assistance.
[time=861] We have a booklet entitled "Good Grief" that we'd like to offer to you that will be a great help in just coping
[time=869] with some of the problems of life.
[time=871] You can receive this little booklet by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=881] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=890] Russ, I know that can be a benefit to a lot of people.
[time=893] Sometimes we know of passages of Scripture or we know of something in the Word of God, but sometimes when it's contained in a topical booklet, it really does help us, doesn't it?
[time=901] Tremendously helpful little book and I can recommend it to you.
[time=904] I've given it to many, many people who have been writing the throes of a very difficult situation and they have read it and it's helped them really.
[time=910] That's great.
[time=911] Thus we're in the throes of gearing up for the fall.
[time=914] We have a lot of programs.
[time=915] We have ladies Bible studies.
[time=917] We have evangelism programs.
[time=918] I want to acquire a new registration for the choir.
[time=921] It's just a lot of things happening.
[time=923] In some cases, people that aren't even involved with our church can get involved in some of these programs.
[time=929] That's really true.
[time=930] Our WANNA program can't accept kids from obviously the neighborhood who have no church and then other kids who have a church, but maybe they don't have a WANNA program.
[time=938] WANNA is a tremendous ministry designed to help children hide the Word of God in their heart.
[time=943] It's fun.
[time=944] There's plenty of activity and there's a great team of leadership and counselors, so to speak, that help the kids along the way.
[time=951] Our women's Bible studies are starting up and we have about ten of them.
[time=955] They meet in homes and they're strictly designed to get around God's Word and study the Word of our great God.
[time=963] They meet on all different mornings.
[time=965] They meet some on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday mornings and also in those same evenings.
[time=969] There's about nine in all and if our listeners are interested in finding out where one of those Bible studies is meeting,
[time=976] they can write us at the Bible hour.
[time=978] We'd be happy for them to come by.
[time=980] Yes, we've given you the address already.
[time=982] I want to give you that address once again.
[time=984] It's just simply the Bible hour.
[time=986] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=990] The zip code is 46815.
[time=993] Or if you'd like to call us, the area code is 219-493-7400.
[time=1000] Just call the information desk and we'll try to help you.
[time=1003] If you're in our area and you'd like to be involved in a Bible study or you have children, I'd like to get involved in our WANNA program.
[time=1011] We'd love to have you join with us.
[time=1013] We're looking forward now to going back to the final portion of our service with the message from Russell Moore.
[time=1019] I hope that the music and the message are an inspiration for your life today and will help you throughout the difficult week that you may have in the coming days.
[time=1028] Stay with us now for the remainder of our service and God bless you.
[time=1038] We will declare it.
[time=1050] It's the name above all names.
[time=1057] And we will shout it to our dying world.
[time=1065] Who will declare my name?
[time=1070] Who will shout my name in the midst of the nation?
[time=1083] Who will take the shield of faith and the sword of my word
[time=1090] and declare my name to a dying world?
[time=1097] He who have declared me thus far
[time=1103] will walk in even greater power
[time=1110] for the sound of time are running out
[time=1117] my name will be declared in this final hour
[time=1123] I am Jehovah, I am that I am
[time=1129] and my trumpet shall soon fall out
[time=1136] I for the words without this word
[time=1143] I am getting ready, I am getting ready
[time=1150] I am getting ready to shine
[time=1159] It's the name above all names
[time=1166] And we will declare it.
[time=1174] It's the name above all names.
[time=1179] And we will shout it to our dying world.
[time=1189] It's my will to possess all of your life
[time=1198] I'll take it all so surrender to me
[time=1204] for I'm building an army to go in my name
[time=1210] and the words of your mouth shall set the captives free
[time=1218] I am Jehovah, I am that I am and my trumpet shall soon fall out
[time=1231] I for the words without this word
[time=1237] I am getting ready, I am getting ready
[time=1247] I am getting ready to shine
[time=1253] It's the name above all names
[time=1260] And we will shout it to our dying world
[time=1291] The name above all names
[time=1297] And we will declare it.
[time=1304] The name above all names
[time=1310] And we will shout it to our dying world.
[time=1320] (applause)
[time=1334] Amen, thank you Sue.
[time=1336] Well as we continue in this theme of the Good Shepherd this morning Let me invite you to take your Bibles and open them to the 23rd Psalm Psalm 23 And if you'll follow along as I read, we'll refresh our minds of this familiar portion of Scripture
[time=1356] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside quiet waters, He restores my soul
[time=1367] He guides me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou art with me Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me Thou dost prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies Thou hast anointed my head with oil my cup overflows Surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all the days of my life And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever We've offered some level of structure for this wonderful song The first point would be the relationship that the sheep have with their shepherd The Lord is my shepherd There's a strong emphasis there of possession, it's almost a boasting if you will Look, this is the one who is mine, this is the one who cares for me As a result I do not struggle with hardship, I do not starve, I do not suffer I am not weak and riddled with disease because that one right there He see him, he's my shepherd But the myelm also leads us to that profound truth That not only are the sheep claiming ownership of the shepherd But the shepherd has in fact owned and bought the sheep John 10 says that the good shepherd has laid down his life for the sheep And David begins to describe the reality That the lot in life of sheep is not principally dependent upon themselves But instead upon their shepherd They either have a healthy, strong, vibrant life or they don't And that depends not upon themselves but upon their shepherd And that's what he says in the rest of verse 2 The rest I shall not want Describing a place of absolute total content There's nothing that I can think of that I don't already have or should have or need And to be honest with you, I struggle with that a little bit When I read it and I go on to look at the rest of the psalm The same scene is so serene, it's so peaceful, it's idyllic, it's almost perfect What more could you want and it doesn't quite seem to match up with my own experience I find I'm a little more able to identify personally out of my own experience With a psalm like Psalm 69 where David said save me, oh God For the waters have threatened my life, I have sunken a deep mire And there is no foothold Sometimes that's a little more descriptive of my day-to-day than the serenity of the Lord My shepherd I shall not want Even Psalm 32 which David wrote When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through the groaning all day long And as I try to hang on to my sin and refuse to humble myself And admit my unworthiness of Christ, I then find a great level of identity with Psalm 32
[time=1530] It helps me to remember that the 23rd Psalm is describing probably a point in time in David's life
[time=1538] Most likely the end of his life After the days of adultery have since come and gone And after the murder of Uriah the Hittite are now over And even after Absalom's insurrection and the terror and the torment and the man's soul of his own son Trying to take away his kingdom Those were the hardship days, now it seems as if he sits and looks back and says You know through all of that, through all of my mistakes, through all of my shortcomings The Lord has been my shepherd The Lord has never ceased, and I think, and here is the main point I think the thrust of Psalm 23 isn't so much my experience of the shepherd but his commitment to me
[time=1575] What is being told to us in this great wonderful little song
[time=1581] Is not so much how much I enjoy my life and the I shall not want But how much I can rest and be assured in the fact that Jesus is the shepherd And he'll provide for all my needs It lifts up the shepherd saying, I am committed to you I will provide for you, I have the means by which to do that And so this analogy of shepherd and sheep And I was thinking about this as I studied again this week When I was in California we would drive to the northern part of the state And have to go through the San Joaquin Valley, this gigantic space of land It's an inland valley, it's off the coast Semi-arid conditions and they've learned to irrigate it through the California aqueduct And it's really a greenhouse, it's a natural greenhouse And they grow more lettuce there than any other place in the world It's called the lettuce bowl of the world And they also raise sheep there because the semi-arid dry conditions are favorable to sheep And they're parallel to that you'd find in Jerusalem in some ways And as we go through and see these huge herds of sheep out there in the distance It'd be a little trailer and that would be where the shepherd stayed And I never saw the shepherds when I drove by They seem to be inside there probably watching TV with their dish Pulling that stuff in, I'm thinking this is a cush job I mean how boring could it be?
[time=1655] But in studying this passage I have learned that that is far from the truth
[time=1661] A shepherd works hard if he takes care of his sheep the way they ought to be It's not get along anywhere type sheep, it's a sheep that needs the constant careful nurturing of its shepherd
[time=1671] In fact, there is no other class of livestock that requires more careful attention than do sheep
[time=1678] None sheep are at the top of the list And that's why David goes on then in these remaining verses verses 2 through 6 To describe the kind of care that the shepherd provides for his sheep Let's look at the first four of them in these two verses verses 2 and 3 Let me read him again He makes me lie down in green pastures He leads me beside quiet waters He restores my soul, he guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake This first one, he makes me lie down in green pastures It's a beautiful picture, in your mind if you will There are some sheep and they're a middle of a big gorgeous green pasture that's knee deep And you know this lush grass and they've eaten until their hearts are content and they've laid down They can't get any better, they're totally completely satisfied But that does not happen by accident That is the product of a lot of hard work on the part of the shepherd, Palestine And especially where David would have kept watch over his flock there in Bethlehem Is a dry sun-baked wasteland much of the year And the sheep do well in this dry semi-arid condition It's good for their health, the parasites which are so dangerous to them do not do as well there But these green pastures are neither common nor natural They are the product of hard industry on the part of the shepherd He must clear his pasture of its rocks tearing out roots and stumps Plowing the land, planting special grains and even irrigating them with water If they are to be full and lush as these green pastures are being described Sheep by the way who do not have green pastures and therefore are not satisfied They're still hungry, they don't lie down They stand up and they walk around looking for food This is the picture of a satisfied sheep at the cost and the expense of the shepherd
[time=1788] The second thing you'll notice is it says he leads me beside quiet waters This too is a beautiful picture of sheep that have drunk to their hearts content They're satisfied, they couldn't want any more water than they've got And it's pure water, it's clear water, it's healthy water Sheep if left of themselves when they become thirsty will drink just about anything And more often than not they'll stick their face in a little pot hole full of some water That is full also of not just water but churned up mud, manure and urine
[time=1820] That is infested with parasites which they then ingest and it causes them great sickness
[time=1826] But the shepherd knows this and so he leads them past that stuff to watering holes That he has scouted out oftentimes even prepared himself That there would be a source of healthy water for them to drink The next thing you'll notice is it says he restores my soul He restores my soul Psalm 42.11 says why are you cast down, oh my soul
[time=1848] A restored soul or a cast down soul, those are opposites A sheep is called cast or it's a cast sheep When it has laid down and it's got all of its wall all over it and its fleece is very long And typically they'll find a little hollow to lie in and when they really relax They'll just kind of roll over and find themselves on their back and they can't get out They can't get up because the fleece is too long and they'll stand there or lay there With their legs in the air and frantically trying to get up and that only aggravates the situation Because it causes the gases in the rumen to continue to Bloat the sheep which eventually cuts off its circulation to its limbs and it dies The shepherd has to come and literally lift the thing up and put it back up on its feet Eventually it'll recover from that experience Depending upon how long if it's only been a couple of hours on a hot day a sheep can die If it's a cooler day they can last maybe a day or two but they come out of it kind of slow And the shepherd picks them up and holds them and brings them back and they run off then to be back with the fold
[time=1907] Notice also there in verse 3 he guides me in the paths of righteousness
[time=1913] Here again it is another service that the shepherd must provide for the sheep or they'll destroy the pasture
[time=1921] Sheep have the capacity they're creatures of habit and they the way they chew grass they nip it off right there at the base
[time=1928] And then if it's all gone they'll start pawing up even the roots to get the roots And they'll just stay in the same pasture till they've done that and absolutely destroy it And they'll use the same paths going to and fro Always just stay right in that same place and those paths become widened and then it rains and the erosion And with time they can destroy an absolutely perfect pasture It's a requirement of a shepherd to observe his flock in a particular pasture And when it's reached its maximum point for both sheep and pasture he moves them He takes them on a different path where they wouldn't otherwise go unless he was leading them So that he can continue to maintain his sheep and his pastures and provide for them in the future
[time=1967] So what do you have in these first two verses? Look at it again He makes me lie down in green he feeds me He gives me water to drink He restores my soul and he leads me in paths of righteousness Now grab the end of verse 1 I'm satisfied I shall not want I'm blessed or I'm happy because I eat in his pasture I drink his water and he leads me in the paths of righteousness Starting to sound familiar? I'm happy when I eat and drink
[time=2001] And I walk in righteousness Open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 5 And look at verse 6 I'm satisfied when I eat and I drink and I walk in righteousness
[time=2015] Matthew chapter 5, 6 and 7 That's all the Sermon on the Mount and these are a series of Beatitudes And the sixth one is the flip side of these verses in Psalm 23 Blessed are you there Matthew chapter 5 verse 6 Blessed or happy or satisfied or I shall not want Are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be full
[time=2039] They shall be satisfied It's the flip side In other words if the shepherd is breaking his back to prepare the pasture and clear the field And provide the water and lead you in paths of righteousness Constantly keeping you from overgrazing And that's what he's doing for us What is our response? What should we do?
[time=2057] How should we enter into this? I shall not want state and the answer is there in verse 6 Blessed are those who are happy are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness
[time=2067] Now we get it so backwards in our lives We are so prone to try to reverse it And say that happy are those who hunger and thirst for happiness We seek happiness We seek the blessedness It becomes our greatest ambition And in setting it as our ambition we miss it every time You can't get happiness by seeking happiness The Bible never instructs us to go out and seek happiness Directly it always says seek righteousness or seek God And the byproduct of seeking righteousness and seeking God is this blessedness Jesus is actually in the business of blessedness Now blessedness is just another word for happiness So Jesus is in the happiness business That's what these Beatitudes are about But nowhere do they say seek it It's a byproduct, look at it, verse 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit For theirs is the kingdom of heaven to be poor in spirit Is to realize you are absolutely totally spiritually bankrupt And there's nothing you can do for yourself And so like a beggar with his hand in the air for some bread Stuck in a corner somewhere who dares not even lift his face And ask for the bread just kind of mumbles help me bread So are we to be before God And then we're happy Verse 4, blessed are those who mourn Blessed are those who are so overcome by the reality of their own sinfulness And how far short of the mark of God they actually fall When you are mourning over your sinfulness you're happy Verse 5, blessed are the gentle for they shall inherit the earth The word could be meekness It is those people who refuse to assert their own rights and demand their just do And when you are gentle and voluntarily giving up your rights for the cause of Christ You're happy The same is true in verse 5 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness on and on it goes Merciful in verse 7, the pure in heart are happy in verse 8 The peacemakers are happy in verse 9 Those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness are happy in verse 10 And those of you who are receiving insults and are persecuting you Because of your testimony, you're happy too So Jesus has got a lot of happiness for us, but it's never found by seeking happiness It's always found by seeking something else It's a great reminder, isn't it?
[time=2198] We are so prone when circumstances fall apart in our lives To begin to believe the false truth or the false lie what looks like truth And if I can just solve this, this, this, this and this I'll be happy again It's not true Seek righteousness Hunger and thirst for righteousness and you'll be satisfied, you'll be blessed Well what is this righteousness? Jesus describes it in verse 20 He says, "For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees
[time=2227] You shall not enter the kingdom of heaven Jesus is here confronting in the Sermon on the Mount There are His disciples, there are these scribes and Pharisees sitting there And there are these multitudes that have followed Him because of His marvelous miracles And He's sitting on a mountain and He's declaring This is the, by the way, the thesis statement of His entire message Of chapter 5, 6 and 7, that is this, "Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven" And He goes on to describe the righteousness Look at it in verse 21, you've heard that it said, "Thou shalt not murder" Verse 22, "But I say to you that if you're angry in your heart with your brother, you're guilty before the court True righteousness is not an external thing, it's an internal reality that flows out of your heart He's saying all these Pharisees, they don't murder anybody, but they're angry And they say, "Rocka" in their heart and they're as guilty as if they had Verse 23, "You come here to present your offering at the altar And you remember there, you have a brother that you have something against Your relationships aren't right, well then get up, leave your offering and go get it right True righteousness does not worship God when there is relational fracture in the body of Christ The law of adultery, in verse 27, "You have heard that it's been said, thou shalt not commit adultery But I say unto you, if a man looks on a woman to lust for her in his heart, he's committed adultery with her already He's saying, "Man, the true standard of righteousness is what you're doing in the privacy of your own heart And if you're lusting for a woman, that's not true righteousness You want to be happy? Seek these things." Look at it in verse 31 You've heard it said, "These are all these laws that the Pharisees were bringing up, some of them were out of the Bible And a lot of them were out of their own tradition, out of the Talmud Whoever divorces his wife let him give a certificate of dismissal But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife except for the cause of unchastity Meaning hard-hearted adultery makes her commit adultery and whoever marries a divorce woman commits adultery
[time=2337] He's talking about that relationship of a man and a wife and there that enduring faithful commitment
[time=2343] That nothing can break the vows of marriage Save an unrepentant hard-hearted commitment to adultery in one of the partners
[time=2352] And even then God hates divorce Righteousness hangs on to marriages Righteousness does not lust after other women Righteousness does not come to worship when you are angry with your brother Righteousness does not hold anger in your heart against another person It's amazing Jesus has prepared the pasture Jesus has prepared the quiet waters Jesus has prepared to come by and pick you up and restore you to your feet Jesus has prepared to lead you in the paths of righteousness And he's got all that covered We've got to avail ourselves of it by being hungry and thirsty Not for happiness Not for the I shall not want but for the righteousness And then eventually we begin to enter into the I shall not want as a byproduct of seeking righteousness
[time=2400] It's an amazingly powerful spiritual truth that permeates all of our lives
[time=2406] No matter what you're struggling with, no matter what you're hurt is No matter what you're wishing what happened that isn't happening Or what could change in your life?
[time=2414] The answer is not found in your circumstances As nice and as pleasant as those can be and as hard as some of those can be The answer is found in you setting your face towards Christ And seeking righteousness and knowing that in your shepherd you shall not want If that is what you are wanting You will supply it all Well now back to Psalm 23 We come now to the remainder of the Psalm verses 4, 5 and 6
[time=2442] And look at what he says, "For even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou art with me Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me Thou dest prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies Thou hast anointed my head with oil my cup overflows This is the halfway point in the Psalm And we know that's true because of a couple of reasons Number one the personal pronouns change Notice in the first few verses it's like he's describing the shepherd He makes me lie down He leads me beside quiet waters He restores my soul He guides me in passive righteousness It's like I'm telling you about my shepherd And when we get to verse 4 I'm not telling anybody about my shepherd I'm talking to my shepherd Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou or for you You are with me It's your rod and your staff that comforts me You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies You have anointed my head with oil It's deeply personal Major shift happens right there at verse 4 Another thing that tells us we've got a halfway point if you will In the Psalm is because the circumstances change It's no longer green pastures and quiet waters And paths of righteousness Now it's a valley, a valley that is described as the shadow of death And evil is around And enemies are in the presence Things are changing here, what's going on?
[time=2525] Well, some would suggest and I agree with it That you've got a season change A season change going on here The first few verses, as we've already studied Would be the season of winter and spring Where the sheep are kept on the home ranch The lowlands And it's there that he industriously works To provide the green pasture and the regular watering holes And he moves them from this pasture to this pasture By his calculated timing But when summer comes You can't remain on the lowlands It's too dry The sun bakes it too hard And there's no way to do that And a good shepherd will move his sheep Up off of the home ranch up into the highlands The high country For the high summer ranges The plateaus and the tablelands Verse 5, "Thou hast prepared a table before me The presence of mine enemies The western United States and southern Europe These high plateaus are called tablelands Or we sometimes call them maces The Spanish word for table They had in the summer months for the highlands That's probably where David was When Samuel came to inspect the household And couldn't find David and go send for him They probably had to retrieve him from a distant place Where he had taken his sheep for grazing But to get there they have to go through the valleys You see it in verse 4, "Even though I walk through the valley Of the shadow of death They're leaving behind the security of the home ranch And the routine and they must now follow An utter dependence upon the shepherd Which may account for why the personal language Comes in so strong here It's just you and me, Mr. Shepherd And unless you take me through this I'm a goner On the way to the plateaus One would have to make their way up Through these valleys of the shadow of death Scared by deep ravines, jagged cliffs They kind of have to wind their way through Carefully guided and gently prodded by the shepherd Slowly moving along, feeding upon the grass That is coming forth behind the receding snow line So it's a dangerous place It's not as secure as it was before But that's okay because here I find you I find you to be more intimate to me And I am all you have And you are all I have And notice then the rod and the staff at the end of verse 4 These are the only things that the shepherd has To help negotiate all of this Rod is really just a club It was a young sapling that would have been taken out of the ground And the shepherd would then cut it off at the top And end up with a stick about this long With a big bulb on the other end of it Where the trunk would meet where the roots were under the ground And then he'd take that rough root And he'd smoothed it into a nice round head And he could hit people with it or hit animals It's probably what David used when he was describing How he had killed the lion and the bear Grabbed him by his beard and said, and I struck him on the head And he died, he was probably using that rod at that very moment The staff would be the number one identifying mark of a shepherd Whenever you see a staff you think shepherd Because it's only helpful to a shepherd A staff is of no use to a man who leads cattle Or raises hogs or deals with horses It's peculiar instrument to the shepherd He uses it sometimes to scoop up a little newborn And drop it over to its mother without getting his own scent on the newborn Oftentimes he'll want to inspect the sheep But it won't want to be inspected so he'll latch it and pull it in here And take a look checking on it for any types of wounds or diseases Many times he'll use the length of it to tap on the side of the shoulder of a sheep So he can direct it through a little subtle pressure and keep it on the right path And another thing he'll use it to do is to latch a hold of a sheep In search of a little extra bite of grass Oftentimes a sheep will draw itself into a thorn bush And there once inside gets all tangled up with its fleece And the shepherd really doesn't go in there to grab it Because there are too many thorns, so he uses his staff and he hooks it And he kind of pulls it out and frees it so he can get out of there All that stuff happens up there on the high plateaus All that stuff happens in the unfamiliar surroundings And so it's his rod and his staff These are the ones that comfort me Notice then in verse 5 "Prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies And thou hast anointed my head with oil Summertime is fly time The flies come out in great masses And there are all kinds of them that present difficult problems to the sheep One of them is called a nose fly And Keller, who wrote the definitive work on the 23rd Psalm says this These little flies buzz about the sheep's head Attempting to deposit their eggs on the damp, mucous membranes of the sheep's nose If they are successful, the eggs will hatch in a few days To form small, slender, worm-like larvae They work their way up the nasal passages into the sheep's head They burrow into the flesh And they're set up an intense irritation accompanied by severe inflammation For relief from this agonizing annoyance Sheep will deliberately beat their heads against trees, rocks, posts, or brush They will rub them in the soil, thrash around against woody growth In extreme cases of intense infestation, a sheep may even kill itself In a frenzied endeavor to gain relief from the aggravation And so what the shepherd does is he takes his oil Usually it's a mixture with sulfur and spices And he'll put it all over the nose of the sheep But often over the entire head Because these insects are capable of entering through the ear And the eyes provide moisture in places where they can lay their eggs again And so they'll sometimes just douse the whole head in this oil And keep the sheep safe from this pestering reality
[time=2857] It's a powerful picture of incredible provision Just picture your Jesus taking care of you this way This is the level to which he is committed to you And in some ways to stoop as the God of the universe Declaring pastures and providing clean water And picking us up when we've fallen down And leading us from one path to another so we don't overgraz our life as it were
[time=2880] He leads us then and walks with us Now I like this There are points in our lives where we are cared for by our Lord in security and in comfort
[time=2890] And some of us in the room are feeling our lives to be just It's working right now, you know, everything's going right Things are going well with your kids and things are going well with your business or your job And your financial statements are okay You're just praising God, you know, you're kind of like the sheep on the home base And everything seems to be cared for, everything's nice But you know and I know that there are times in our lives where he leads us off of that And away from that security and our circumstances do begin to fall apart And a lot of that is because he's got places for us to go There are things that need to be done, there are people who need to be reached And the kingdom must be advanced and for him to display his wonder and his glory in us He must take us through difficult circumstances Would you turn with me to Matthew chapter 10 for a minute?
[time=2935] Jesus is here speaking to his most beloved sheep These are his disciples, these are the twelve These are the ones with whom he has spent most of his three years in public ministry Day in and day out he has lived with them, he has talked with them, he has cared for them He has put up with them, he has been embarrassed by them And they are his sheep, and he now sends them out He takes them off of the home ranch if you will And he's sending them out into the insecurity of the valley of the shadow of death And here they may die, and he even tells them that Matthew 10 verse 16, behold I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves Therefore be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves Verse 17, "But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the courts And scourge you in the synagogues, and you shall even be brought before governors and kings for my sake As a testimony to them and to the Gentiles But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you will speak for it Shall be given you in that hour what you are to speak" Verse 20, "For it is not you who speak, but it is the spirit of your Father who speaks in you"
[time=3006] He goes on to describe the calamity that will be theirs Look over now in verse 28 "And do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" Now watch, he uses another illustration right out of the natural world He's so such an awesome teacher Verse 29, "Are not two sparrows sold for a cent And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father" But the very hairs of your head are all numbered Therefore do not fear you are of more value than many sparrows And instead of sheep he talks about sparrows The reality is this, there are seasons in our life There are times when we are overwhelmed by the provision of God And we are kept comfortable if you will But there are other times in our lives Many of you are going through them now Well we are led away from that You want to know why?
[time=3072] One, because the kingdom must be advanced And somehow in your suffering and your tribulation that can be accomplished But in the same way that the Psalm shifts from the descriptive to the personal That's what he wants in his relationship with you He doesn't want you to spend your life describing him He wants you to spend parts of your life talking to him out of the reality And the trauma, the crucible of difficult experiences He is longing to shepherd you in a personal way And then back to Psalm 23 for just one more thought
[time=3109] He says, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil, for thou art with me" It's your rod and your staff, they comfort me You're the one who prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies Even though it in my head with oil, my cup overflows now, verse 6 "Surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all the days of my life And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever" He's saying it's not only true in the seasons of my life here on earth But it's eternal Should I die? Should I lose my life for the cause of Christ?
[time=3148] It only means that I'll dwell in the house of this great shepherd forever and ever All they can do is kill me All they can do is take my life But they can't separate me from my awesome shepherd So the 23rd Psalm describes a relationship, a personal intimate relationship
[time=3168] Which is brought about by a shepherd who dies for his sheep A rest that is described and not wanting And then a provision or a resource of that shepherd to provide for every conceivable need in the life of his flock
[time=3181] You know I never had a sheep as a kid, I don't know if you did
[time=3187] I never did, now my sister for her 16th birthday got a pig named Gertie
[time=3195] And a goat named Dubistine And we would let them come in the house on occasion until they got too big But I never had either, you know, a thing like that What I had was a dog When I was 16 years old I had corrective surgery on both feet and had to spend an entire summer in these casts And I couldn't do anything, and my parents very wisely showed up one day with a golden retriever Beautiful little dog, she was about, I don't know, just little I don't know how many weeks or months I should say, but she was little And I didn't have anything else to do Because I was almost immobile, and so I remember sitting there on the floor with her Hour after hour, just hugging her and playing with her like you do the puppy And then I got my sock and I had to tie her to fetch, golden retriever, you know, just instinctive Just right there, didn't have to do much work I remember with great freshness and joy in my heart, thanksgiving
[time=3244] Because all of our relatives, cousins, uncles, aunts, grandma, grandpa would come up for thanksgiving And somehow we ended up at the river, probably I orchestrated this whole thing And I had never hunted with this dog before, Bernie, but they were all there And I had my shotgun, and we'd gone down there to watch this, and a duck flew by and I shot it And it landed in the river The first time ever for her, everybody important to me in the world is watching She takes off through the brush, down the hill, over the hill, leaps into the water like good bird dogs are supposed to
[time=3276] Hustles herself out there to that duck, and just gently takes a hold of it, brings it back and drops it right at my feet Mmm, praise God You know, I'm alive, look at this, this is my dog
[time=3290] We had so many good times, she loved the water, every morning she'd wake up, my mom would let her out about 6.30 And she would go into our pool in the backyard, and she would sometimes enter by the steps, and sometimes she would enter by the diving board
[time=3301] And she would swim a few laps, and then she'd get out by the metal pool, I mean the stairs in the deep end, you know, like humans do She just felt very at home and all this stuff, loved the water, one day we were out at a buddy's ranch Danny Hopson was a farmerly, and they had a huge reservoir, and we were standing at the top of the hill that overlooked it
[time=3318] And he had a big black Labrador, a male, big, strong, aggressive beast of an animal, if you know what I mean
[time=3324] And we would take our sticks, he, his and mine, and we would throw our sticks out there, and watch our dogs charge down this long hill
[time=3331] And then leap into the water, and hustle out there, and retrieve, and you know, you do it over and over and over, because they seem to be inexhaustible
[time=3337] One time we threw our sticks, and they got too far apart, the sticks did, and so both dogs went for the same stick
[time=3343] Somehow Bernie got there first, I think it was to her advantage, the stick was more in her direction
[time=3349] And so she had to stick in her mouth, and the lab came right up behind her, and wanted that stick
[time=3355] And so, you know, with his dog paddle, she's gone, and then she comes up, and then he goes right back over again, and he sinks her again
[time=3365] And it took a little longer this time for my little precious Bernie to come up, you understand, and I'm thinking this is not good
[time=3371] So he dunks her the third time, and off comes the watch, and out comes the wallet, and I charge down this hill
[time=3378] And all my glory, do my, you know, Johnny Wise Miller leap-tars in into the water, I swim through it all, and I get to this big black, evil labrador
[time=3387] And I punch him right in the face, and I kick him under water, and I know I'm afraid he's gonna do this thing to me, you know?
[time=3394] And then Danny's gonna have to come save me, and I reach under the water, and find my dog, and lift her up, and get her going back to the shore
[time=3401] And then I just stay right there in front of him, I just keep hitting him, and kicking him, until I'm afraid now he's going to drown
