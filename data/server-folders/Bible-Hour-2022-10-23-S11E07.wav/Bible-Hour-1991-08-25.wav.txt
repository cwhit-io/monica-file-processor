[time=17] >> Today we're going to begin a study of the book of first Timothy.
[time=21] It's an exciting book written by the Apostle Paul to his true child in the faith, Timothy.
[time=27] Timothy has been left at Ephesus and he has an enormous amount of work to do setting the things of the church in order.
[time=34] Get your Bible.
[time=35] Open it to first Timothy and join us for this exciting study.
[time=38] [MUSIC]
[time=51] >> Welcome to the Bible All War, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=58] Thank you for joining us.
[time=59] Today, Pastor Moore will begin a series of messages from the book of first Timothy.
[time=64] Paul, the author of first Timothy, enjoyed a very special relationship with young Timothy.
[time=70] Paul was not only Timothy's spiritual father, he was his mentor, his teacher.
[time=75] Have your Bible open to the first chapter of first Timothy and be prepared to listen and learn as Paul instructs his young student.
[time=82] Before today's message, we will be ministered to by special music from Marilyn Wong entitled, "What a Day That Will Be." And a solo from Larry Cope entitled, "The Mission." As we prepare our hearts for today's message, let's worship together
[time=100] as the sanctuary choir sings, "My Savior's Love." [MUSIC - 172 seconds]
[time=286] We are indeed thankful for the saving grace of our Lord
[time=293] and we sing of our Redeemer and how thankful we are for the blood that was shed on the cross for our sins.
[time=300] He purchased our pardon and made us free.
[time=303] Him number 506 will sing verses 1, 3, and 4 together at 506.
[time=308] [MUSIC - 126 seconds]
[time=443] - Amen, thank you for your good singing.
[time=447] We're gonna listen now to music.
[time=449] As Marilyn Wong comes and she'll be accompanied by her sister, Marsha Richard.
[time=455] Listen to the message that they have of not only did he provide salvation for us, but he will come again and he's promised to do that and what a day that's going to be.
[time=465] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 169 seconds]
[time=643] (audience applauding)
[time=651] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=654] I also want to say hello to our senior pastor, Russell Morris.
[time=657] Nice to have you on the set today.
[time=658] Russ, things are gearing up for the fall.
[time=661] Children are getting their new tennis shoes and school packs.
[time=665] And before you know, it will be into all the activities that depict the fall of the year.
[time=670] - It's amazing how fast the summer goes by and how quickly our kids grow up.
[time=674] Randy, my eldest, went out and got some new shoes this week and we found out at 10, she is now out of the children's size shoes.
[time=681] So we're now buying young ladies or, I guess, adult shoes, which cost a little bit more and they look so big.
[time=687] I don't know, she's growing up on me.
[time=689] - Somebody made a remark that their 10 year old is still a child, but they have to pay the adult price as well.
[time=696] It's great that they're growing up right before your eyes.
[time=699] It comes fast, so you need to love 'em and enjoy their school years.
[time=703] We just have a little bit of time left with Andy, who's a junior in high school.
[time=707] It just seems like the other day our three children were in school.
[time=710] Speaking of gearing up, we're gearing up for September 15th.
[time=713] That's Friend Day here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=716] And if you're accustomed to watching the Bible Hour but you don't attend a church regularly, you've never been to any of our services, why don't you set September 15 aside and come and join with us on that day.
[time=726] We'd like to have you be our special guests.
[time=729] We have our services at 9.15 a.m. and 10.50.
[time=733] Great time of music and with our senior pastor, Russell Moore, speaking, perhaps you'll get a chance to meet him that day and I hope you'll set that day to side and come and join with us.
[time=743] That would be a great time to get to know you and to realize that you're supporting our ministries here on the Bible Hour.
[time=751] Well, Russell, there are a lot of us that take a lot of time to prepare for college, for our children in the future, for material things that we have.
[time=760] And every once in a while, some unfortunate circumstances hit us, loss of a job, a loss of a loved one, or perhaps even retirement.
[time=770] There are adjustments that come into our lives that really hit and impact us emotionally and we need to be ready for that too.
[time=776] We have a gift offer that's a great help in that area.
[time=779] It's this little book, Good Grief, and we've been offering it here for a few weeks.
[time=782] I think this is our last week to make this as an offer.
[time=786] And I really believe in this little book, I think it's very helpful.
[time=789] I think it can, in a very concise and clear manner, help us deal with some of the losses you're speaking of.
[time=796] - Well, I had a lady this week that wrote and asked for the book and she said, "You know, I really don't have a circumstance right now "for that book, but I often have friends "or I may be in that circumstance someday "that I'll need to read that book." So she has it for her library or a collection of books for helps and that could be true in your case.
[time=814] Did you say, "Well, I just don't have a circumstance like that." Well, write for the book and keep it handy.
[time=819] We'd like to send it to you today.
[time=820] If you'll write to us at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=838] You know, Russ, as we gear up for the fall, we are also reminded that the Bible Hour is sponsored by members of the Founders Club and we want to thank you again for being so faithful in your giving and just remind you that you need to pray for us on a regular basis that God will help us and give us wisdom as to what stations we should go on and give us openings where the gospel can go beyond our four walls here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and be a real help, especially to shut-ins and people that don't normally attend church or can't.
[time=870] And we trust that you'll pray for us this week and that the remainder of the program today will be a blessing to you.
[time=877] And Russell, I know that you're thankful in your short time here just to hear from the people as we have the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=884] - We've been receiving some really positive letters and it's great to know that God is using the word in this ministry to encourage people.
[time=891] We're also excited that we'll have a man as a guest speaker in our church and therefore on the Bible Hour by the name of Dr. Bob Provost, he's with Send International and he's the one that is leading the charge of evangelicals into the Soviet Union through Send International.
[time=906] In fact, he landed in the Soviet Union last Sunday which is when all the coup began.
[time=910] We've been faithfully praying for him and heard just two days ago that he was indeed safe and now of course, since everything has worked out as far as we can tell in such a profitable way for the people of the Soviet Union.
[time=923] But we're looking forward to having Bob come and give us some insight from his firsthand experience of what is really going on in the Soviet Union both politically and primarily in the spiritual realm.
[time=933] - I'll be a marvelous day and we'll just tell you the date is September 29th.
[time=938] Just kind of keep that in your mind.
[time=940] It will be reminding you in the coming weeks that that'll be a great day with Dr. Bob Provost.
[time=945] We go back to the Morning Worship Service now with more music from Larry Kalk and then the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=952] I hope that you'll stay with us for the remainder of the Bible hour.
[time=955] - Thank you for grooming him and bringing him here with us.
[time=963] And may the softening of this morning continue to deliver that water.
[time=966] We ask this in Jesus' holy precious name, amen.
[time=969] (upbeat music)
[time=978] [MUSIC - 252 seconds]
[time=1235] - Thank you, Larry.
[time=1238] For those of you who don't know, Larry is the brother of Dr. Bill Kulp, who's a member of our church, and Larry's visiting us.
[time=1244] He's also a professional golf instructor, and we have an appointment right after the service today.
[time=1249] Thanks for coming, sharing.
[time=1252] If you have your Bibles with you this morning, let me invite you to take them and open to First Timothy, the book of First Timothy, and we will begin today what will last for many months in an expository study of First Timothy.
[time=1270] It's exciting for me to come to this place in my life where for the next half a year, I guess, probably I will be immersed in studying and endeavoring to understand and communicate to you the heart of the Apostle Paul as he writes to his beloved child in the faith in Timothy.
[time=1287] But I thought just briefly before I began, I might give some help in understanding what I mean by expository preaching or an expository message.
[time=1297] So you'd know at least what we're attempting to do.
[time=1299] There are basically three types of messages that can be preached.
[time=1302] There is a topical message, a textual message or an expositional message.
[time=1307] All of them are valid ways of communicating God's truth.
[time=1311] A topical message is one in which a particular biblical topic would be singled out and then tracked through the Old and New Testament and the findings would be brought together into a sermon and shared.
[time=1324] We did something similar to this, not too many Sunday nights ago on the topic of wisdom and studying with the Old Testament and the New Testament had to say about it, derives what we hope were some helpful principles about wisdom.
[time=1337] There is also textual preaching, which is taking a particular text or passage of scripture and then really using it as a gateway or a springboard into the theme of that passage.
[time=1348] For example, Romans chapter 13 might be used by someone who wants to prepare a textual message because it deals with the government and that is the theme of that passage and jumping from there might speak to or about the government from various points in the scriptures and sharing general truth about that.
[time=1365] There is an expository preaching which focuses predominantly and primarily on the text and its context.
[time=1375] Expository preaching is the presentation of biblical truth derived from and transmitted through a historical grammatical spirit guided study of a passage in its context.
[time=1389] In other words, an expository message finds its soul source in scripture.
[time=1395] It is extracted from exegesis of a particular passage.
[time=1400] Exegesis means to draw out the meaning of a text.
[time=1403] Isegesis is the opposite of that and that's what you get your hand slapped for in seminary sermon prep classes when you bring your own material to the text and force it in there.
[time=1412] That's called isegesis.
[time=1413] The effort is to exegede and let the scriptures speak for itself.
[time=1417] The goal is simply to interpret scripture in its normal sense and in light of its context explaining the original God intended meaning and then applying that truth to today.
[time=1430] It's what Nehemiah 8.8 says when it says they read the book and then they translated it giving the meaning so the people could get the sense of it or understand the reading.
[time=1441] Expository preaching like all others though is for the preacher in many ways a terrifying experience.
[time=1450] It's 1 Corinthians 2 as Paul said.
[time=1452] I came to you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
[time=1456] And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not rest on the wisdom of men but on the power of God.
[time=1473] So the idea is to come to a particular text.
[time=1475] This morning it will be 1 Timothy 1 verses one, two and a little bit of three and say what the Bible has said.
[time=1483] Not talk about the Bible but say it in such a way that the Bible speaks.
[time=1487] The Bible is explained.
[time=1489] It's exegeted and it's exposited.
[time=1491] The passage we have in front of us in this book really, 1 Timothy.
[time=1499] I first wanna give you just a brief overview of it and then we'll go back in a little bit more detail.
[time=1505] I want you to have some idea where we're going before we try to go there.
[time=1509] Paul is writing this book to his true child in the faith, Timothy.
[time=1512] And Timothy is a preacher at this point.
[time=1515] He is a pastor and he has been instructed to remain on at Ephesus.
[time=1520] And the church at Ephesus was planted by Paul along with Priscilla and Aquila.
[time=1526] And it is under attack.
[time=1527] It is under attack by secular influences in the environment and it is also under attack by seductive heresies of false prophets who are both outside the church and inside the church.
[time=1540] And as a result, it is in danger.
[time=1543] And you'll find kind of the main statement of the book in chapter three, verse 15.
[time=1547] If you go there with me, it's kind of the thesis statement.
[time=1551] I am writing these things to you, verse 14, hoping to come to you before long.
[time=1556] But in case I am delayed, I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=1569] This book basically has three parts to it and they don't lay out in sequential order.
[time=1574] It really defies a careful laying out of the content because some of it is so repetitive.
[time=1581] But there are three major themes.
[time=1583] He warns against the false doctrine and the false prophets.
[time=1587] That is a major theme and you'll see it's really an extrapolation of something that he had done when he was with the elders at Ephesus some years before.
[time=1594] And then he goes on to present his strategy, if you will.
[time=1598] How are we to confront this volatile situation?
[time=1602] And it's twofold, one, he speaks to the preacher himself and he instructs the preacher to teach the truth and to live the truth and then he speaks to the church and he says to the church at large, this is what you must be doing as you fight this important battle.
[time=1617] So I offer an outline for this morning's message.
[time=1620] It is one, the source of this letter, two, the servant in this letter, three, the situation surrounding this letter and four, the strategy in this letter.
[time=1632] And it is I must admit a little reminiscent for me of my last days at the Masters College and John MacArthur is certainly not the Apostle Paul and I am certainly not Timothy.
[time=1642] But there was a similar relationship and my faith had come to fruition under his ministry and I stayed with him for 12 years and traveled with him on vacations and worked with him in ministry.
[time=1652] And as my time to leave Southern California was drawing to an end and my great new horizons were Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1660] John MacArthur would sit me down more often than usual and have a word with me.
[time=1664] And in a sense put his spiritual arm around me and say now as you're about ready to embark on this most awesome mission of your life, please listen and he would reaffirm things.
[time=1673] And he would say things to me personally about my own personality, my weaknesses and my strengths.
[time=1678] And he would also go beyond that to talk at length about the church in America and what is happening in the evangelical world.
[time=1685] And he would charge me if you will with some principles which I then wrote down and still have and review on occasion.
[time=1693] So if you will, this is a letter from the Apostle Paul who wants to impart and to solidify and to finalize some beacon likes if you will and the ministry of a young man named Timothy.
[time=1707] Let's begin, verse one, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our savior and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope to Timothy, my true child in the faith, grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=1728] As I urged you upon my departure from Macedonia remain on at Ephesus and let's stop there.
[time=1736] First, the source, it's Paul and he claims himself an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our savior.
[time=1745] And it's interesting, we're all I think familiar with these salutations in Paul's letters and they all kind of sound the same.
[time=1750] And I looked at those a little more carefully this week.
[time=1753] Paul does not always declare himself an apostle in his salutation.
[time=1758] He typically only declares himself an apostle when in writing that letter he must confront false doctrine or immorality.
[time=1765] Otherwise he opens differently.
[time=1768] To the church at Philippi which really needed no doctrinal correction, in fact the whole message there was to live in the person of Christ and no uncircumstantial joy in him.
[time=1777] He says nothing of his apostle ship just calls himself a bond servant of Christ.
[time=1782] For the church at Thessalonica the bright and shining star of the New Testament churches that it's kind of a highlight in Paul's life because it was so faithful in the work of the ministry and I often compare our church as Blackhawk Baptist to the church at Thessalonica.
[time=1798] He didn't say anything about his apostle ship and his salutation simply Paul, Sylvanas and Timothy and then on he goes.
[time=1805] To Philemon the owner of a slave by the name of Onesimus who had stolen from him and since run away which was punishable by death who later came across Paul's path and Paul converted him.
[time=1816] And now Paul wrote the book of Philemon as an intercessory letter for mercy to see Onesimus as more than a slave run away slave and worthy of death but now a brother in the Lord.
[time=1826] He opens this way Paul a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
[time=1831] So it's peculiar that he usually, he consistently opens his letters that are gonna confront false doctrine and immorality with his apostle ship.
[time=1841] To the church at Corinth which had tremendous moral decay Paul called an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.
[time=1850] To the church at Galatia struggling against legalism Paul an apostle not sent from men nor through the agency of man but through Jesus Christ and God the father.
[time=1862] Paul to the church at Colossae being attacked by all kinds of heresies which would detract from the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1869] He says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.
[time=1874] And now to Timothy he says Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our savior because he knows that he has to confront the false doctrine that is there.
[time=1887] In this church he, excuse me, in this letter he writes about the church.
[time=1892] It was a new thing you know the New Testament church and the Old Testament says next to nothing about it certainly nothing about how it should be structured, what its priorities ought to be, how it ought to run, what its focus needs to be.
[time=1903] And so what Paul writes in this letter is new revelation about this new thing called the New Testament church.
[time=1909] And it's of great help to Timothy as Paul begins to lay out the structure and the leadership and their responsibility to the truth to declare his authority if you will I'm an apostle of Christ Jesus.
[time=1921] No doubt when Timothy received the letter he would have read it and then as he thought about a younger man confronting older men who were leading the church astray due to false doctrine he would bring that letter with him quite possibly and say see this is from Paul the apostle of Jesus Christ.
[time=1937] It would bolster his case.
[time=1940] Apostles simply is derived from a verb that means to send or to commission or to dispatch.
[time=1946] And it could be used at its widest meaning of anybody who was on a gospel mission.
[time=1951] Anybody who'd been sent on a spiritual mission for the cause of Christ.
[time=1955] As such Barnabas and Apaphiditis and Apollus and Sylvanas and Timothy were called apostles.
[time=1963] Certainly not in the sense that you and I think of it when we think of the 12 apostles.
[time=1967] The Bible gives a fuller and a deeper meaning, a richer meaning to that term when it's used in relationship to those men, the 12 and to Paul.
[time=1976] They were apostles not because they were going in a particular mission to a particular place but because Christ had singled them out as apostles no matter where they went, no matter what they were doing they were sent by Christ and carried his full authority.
[time=1993] At least three distinguishing marks of an apostle are presented to us in the New Testament.
[time=1998] One, in order to have been an apostle such as the 12 or Paul you had to be chosen, called and sent by Christ himself.
[time=2008] By Christ himself.
[time=2010] Don't need to turn there but Galatians 1, 15, Paul says this.
[time=2014] But when he who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son and me and then he goes on.
[time=2023] What we see in Acts chapter nine, Christ showing up there and converting Paul on the road to Damascus had already been a decision made before Paul ever got out of the womb that he would be set apart for apostleship and Christ Jesus appeared to him and did that.
[time=2038] Secondly, he had to have eye and ear witness of the words and deeds of Jesus, particularly the resurrection and certainly Paul had that by virtue of the experience on the Damascus road.
[time=2049] But also in Galatians 1 verse 12, he says, "For I neither received it from man nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ." Shortly after his conversion, Paul was sent away to the Arabian desert where he received the revelations from Jesus Christ out of which he wrote most of the New Testament, 13 books and all.
[time=2070] So certainly he was an eye and ear witness of the words and deeds of Jesus.
[time=2075] And then lastly, God always authenticated his apostles with signs and with miracles.
[time=2082] And if you will turn with me to Acts 16, rather 19, Acts chapter 19, you'll find that the apostle Paul did some of his most astounding miracles in the city of Ephesus, the very city to whom he has left or given Timothy and now that he writes.
[time=2101] Acts chapter 19, verse 11.
[time=2104] Look at this, God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.
[time=2119] It's an amazing thing, tremendous power.
[time=2121] There were some Jewish exorcists, verses 13 of following go on to explain who thought they'd get in on the act and they'd start performing their miracles by the same name of Jesus.
[time=2130] And so they come across a guy that's demon possessed and try to cast the spirits out of him, verse 16.
[time=2137] The man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.
[time=2146] And this became known to all both Jews and Greeks who lived in Ephesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord was being magnified.
[time=2155] God had given to Paul especially in the city of Ephesus a remarkable miraculous evidence that he was in reality an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[time=2167] So the source of this letter is none other than the apostle Paul speaking in the authoritative tone as an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[time=2177] Now stay right here with me, will you in Acts?
[time=2180] 'Cause we're gonna need to be here for a minute longer but let me move to the second point in our message, namely the servant.
[time=2186] The servant is Timothy and he calls him my true child in the faith.
[time=2193] Turn back a few pages to Acts chapter 16, verse one where we meet Timothy for the first time.
[time=2198] Acts chapter 16 and he came also to Derby and to Lestra,
[time=2205] now not in Ephesus but where we believe Timothy grew up.
[time=2208] And behold, a certain disciple there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer but his father was a Greek.
[time=2219] Timothy actually came out of an unlawful marriage by Jewish standard.
[time=2223] His mother was a believing Jewish woman.
[time=2227] His father a Greek.
[time=2229] We don't ever learn the name of his father.
[time=2231] The mother's name of course was Eunice.
[time=2234] His grandmother's name was Lois.
[time=2236] And again, if you'll stay right there in Acts, let me fill in a little more of the picture for you about Timothy.
[time=2243] Paul later wrote about Timothy in 2 Timothy 3.15 how that from childhood he had known the sacred writings which were able to give him the wisdom that leads to salvation.
[time=2254] Though his father was a Greek, his mother and his grandmother took him aside on a regular basis and trained him in the Old Testament scriptures.
[time=2262] He was very familiar with them.
[time=2264] Later he actually became a Christian.
[time=2267] Second Timothy 1.5 says this, Paul speaking, "For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well." And again, we don't know the exact time or date of Timothy's salvation.
[time=2286] We believe it came through Paul probably somewhere in his first missionary journey.
[time=2290] We're not certain of that, but we do know that at some point or another he did become saved.
[time=2295] It was a sincere faith.
[time=2297] And then if you look again at Acts chapter 16, you'll notice that he had a good reputation among the brethren, verse two.
[time=2304] He was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Listra and Iconium.
[time=2310] So here you have a young man with an outstanding upbringing by his godly mother and grandmother, who had come to faith in the person of Jesus Christ and who had pursued in his faith for the place that he had a good reputation with whom he lived, the brethren.
[time=2325] It was because of all that that Paul wanted him to accompany him on the next missionary journey, this the second.
[time=2333] And so look at verse three.
[time=2335] Paul wanted this man to go with him and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
[time=2345] Now the Jerusalem Council, not too many days or months before this had concluded that as a believer you don't have to be circumcised.
[time=2353] It's not necessary.
[time=2355] But Paul felt that it would be to Timothy's benefit and to the furtherance of the gospel for him to be circumcised because many, many people were aware of the mixed marriage and felt that it would broaden his sphere of influence.
[time=2368] And it really is to Timothy's credit that he agreed to this.
[time=2372] I mean, at this age in his life, who knows, maybe 35 years of age to be circumcised is a remarkably painful experience, one which he certainly didn't have to do, but because his heart was so for the ministry and he was following Paul's leadership, he agreed to that.
[time=2388] Well, from this point, Timothy kind of comes in and out of the book of Acts and we can piece his life together from other letters and it's sketchy at best.
[time=2399] Let me instead take you to Philippians chapter two and show you the point to which he had come in his life, his stature in his Christian life, Philippians chapter two versus 19 and following.
[time=2411] A relationship between Timothy and Paul came into existence that was marked by trust and respect and love and mutual admiration.
[time=2423] Philippians two, 19, Paul at this point is in prison, in Rome, he is writing one of his prison epistles, but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
[time=2440] For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare, for they all seek after their own interests, not of those, not those of Christ Jesus.
[time=2451] But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.
[time=2460] This is a tremendous statement.
[time=2462] The Bible tells us that when a disciple is fully trained he'll be like his master.
[time=2466] And Paul is saying that Timothy has come to the place in his life where he and he alone, I can send to you as the church at Philippi because I know he'll genuinely care for your interests as opposed to the charlatans of the first chapter which we won't look at.
[time=2482] But these men were preaching the gospel for impure motives, for their own glory, for their own sense of accomplishment.
[time=2488] And they knew that Paul was locked up in prison in Rome and since he was the number one head honcho and he was kind of pushed off the Rome, there was opportunity now for them to establish and assert themselves as the new leader.
[time=2499] And so these men in chapter one were preaching the truth, the gospel, but with impure motives.
[time=2503] Now what Paul says, I'm hoping to send you Timothy because when Timothy comes he won't do that to you.
[time=2508] He'll really be here for your benefit and for your welfare.
[time=2511] And there is this great statement in verse 22, but you know of his proven worth that he served me in the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=2521] And I can't think of anything better to have on my epitaph than that I was of value to the advancement of the kingdom of God.
[time=2529] So Timothy comes to a great place in his life.
[time=2533] He is now a mature man of sorts.
[time=2535] He is ready for the ministry and, excuse me, and Paul, in sending him to Ephesus, puts him now on his most dangerous and stretching and trying and testing mission.
[time=2548] Let me explain now the situation.
[time=2552] The source is Paul, the servant is Timothy and the situation.
[time=2556] The church at Ephesus was under attack, both from its secular environment and from the seductive heresies.
[time=2566] By the way of the secular environment, let me share a few things with you about the city of Ephesus.
[time=2570] It was actually the capital of the Roman province of Asia.
[time=2575] It was a leading commercial and cultural city of the Roman Empire.
[time=2581] And that is probably because located on the western coast of Asia Minor, it had a thriving harbor where all the news would come and all the latest products and all the trading and it would be a hub for transportation and it just brought all the wealth and all the sophistication and all the advancement that typically accompanies a thriving city on a thriving harbor.
[time=2602] At the middle of it all was a seventh wonder of the world.
[time=2607] The temple Diana or Artemis, as it is sometimes referred to.
[time=2612] And this was a massive, all encompassing temple which absolutely dominated the culture with rank paganism and its attendant debauchery and sexual immorality.
[time=2624] Some historians rank Ephesus as the most lascivious city in all of Asia Minor because of the influence of the temple Diana and its thriving port.
[time=2633] One historian describes the temple Diana this way.
[time=2638] Male and female roles were interchanged.
[time=2642] Orgastic sex, homosexuality and other sexual perversions were common.
[time=2648] Artemis or Diana was herself a sex goddess represented by an ugly repulsive female idol that looks something like a cross between a cow and a wolf.
[time=2659] She was served by thousands of temple prostitutes, eunuchs, singers, dancers and priestesses.
[time=2669] Idols of Artemis or Diana and other deities were to be seen everywhere in every size and made out of many different materials.
[time=2677] A quarter mile wide perimeter served as an asylum for criminals who were safe from apprehension and punishment as long as they remained within the temple confines.
[time=2689] For obvious reasons, the presence of hundreds of hardened criminals added still further to Ephesus' corruption and vice.
[time=2696] A fifth century BC philosopher, a pagan himself, referred to Ephesus as the darkness of vileness.
[time=2704] The morals were lower than animals and the inhabitants of Ephesus were fit only to be drowned.
[time=2712] And there is no reason to believe the situation significantly changed from the date of that fifth century BC writing until now.
[time=2719] Excuse me, until Timothy's day, namely then now.
[time=2723] Ephesus was a hard place to be.
[time=2726] It was a difficult assignment.
[time=2728] If you'll come back with me to the book of Acts, we'll find that the gospel came first to Ephesus through Paul and his traveling companions, Aquila and Priscilla.
[time=2742] They were faithful friends of Paul's and he eventually left them there on his first visit, Acts chapter 18, verses 18 and 19.
[time=2752] Acts chapter 18, verses 18 and 19, it says this,
[time=2758] Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brother and put out to sea for Syria and with him were Priscilla and Aquila in Saint-Geria.
[time=2768] He had his haircut for he was keeping a vow.
[time=2770] Now verse 19, and they came to Ephesus and he left them there.
[time=2775] Now he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews and when they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not consent, but taking leave of them and saying, I will return to you again if God wills, he set sail from Ephesus.
[time=2788] So they're only for a brief time, but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind.
[time=2793] It wasn't too long though before he returned and then he stayed a long, long time.
[time=2798] Turn over now to Acts chapter 20 and look at verse 26, this passage is really at the end of a three year stay at Ephesus and he is now speaking to the elders of Ephesus.
[time=2810] He stayed there for three years and taught him all the counsel of God, verse 26.
[time=2814] Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God.
[time=2825] So he stayed a good long time, three years in fact and declared to them the entire counsel of God.
[time=2831] In addition to the pagan influences of that secular environment, Timothy would have to confront probably an even more dangerous reality and that of the seductive heresies, the false doctrines that were confronting his church.
[time=2846] Paul warns of it, look at it in verse 28, before he even leaves Ephesus.
[time=2852] Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood.
[time=2862] Verse 29, I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock and from among your own selves, men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.
[time=2877] Therefore be on the alert remembering that day and night for a period of three years, I did not cease to admonish each one with tears.
[time=2885] And I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up.
[time=2891] So there are these seductive heresies, both from within and from without.
[time=2896] And Paul is warning them before he leaves and eventually has to send Timothy there to confront these men personally on his bath.
[time=2905] And you'll see that now, if you'll turn with me to first Timothy and we'll stay there for a while.
[time=2910] Thank you so much for traveling through the scriptures with me.
[time=2915] First Timothy is spotted, pockmarked if you will, with these descriptions and warnings against these false teachers.
[time=2924] The first is found in chapter one, verses three and following.
[time=2928] As I urged you, upon my departure for Macedonia,
[time=2934] remain on at Ephesus in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God, which is by faith.
[time=2949] Go to chapter four, verses one and following.
[time=2954] The spirit explicitly says that in latter times, some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons.
[time=2964] That'll make an interesting study.
[time=2965] A lot of us are interested in the deceitful spirits and the doctrines of demons of our day.
[time=2970] Verse two, by means of the hypocrisy of liars, seared in their conscience as with a branding iron, men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in.
[time=2982] Again, he warns against them in chapter six.
[time=2986] Go there, chapter six, verse three.
[time=2988] If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, he's conceited and understands nothing.
[time=3001] But he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words out of which arise in v. strife, abusive language, evil suspicions and on and on it goes.
[time=3011] So this church, this dear little New Testament church caught up in the city of Ephesus is being attacked by its secular environment.
[time=3020] The temple Diana is in its backyard and all of her influence.
[time=3024] Many of the people who have been saved and are now frequenting the church at Ephesus have come out of that worship.
[time=3031] They're very familiar with it and prone to be drawn back into it at different times.
[time=3036] And in addition to it's being attacked by the secular environment, it's being attacked by these seductive heresies that come both from within, people from within the very church itself and people who come from outside the church and attack it there.
[time=3048] And so it raises the question, what is the strategy?
[time=3053] What does Paul say?
[time=3054] How is this little church of Ephesus to survive and what is Timothy to do about it?
[time=3059] And that's our last point this morning, the strategy.
[time=3062] And it really breaks down into two parts.
[time=3065] He has some very specific things to say to the preacher himself, namely Timothy and then he says some things to the church.
[time=3070] Let's see what they are.
[time=3071] Go back to chapter one.
[time=3073] He says to Timothy, to the preacher.
[time=3077] He says, now this, look at verse 18.
[time=3081] Now Timothy, this command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may fight, fight the good fight, keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
[time=3102] First of all, Timothy, you must, you must fight the good fight and keep the faith and a good conscience.
[time=3110] Now he says the same thing in a little more detail, go to chapter four, verse 11.
[time=3116] He says to Timothy, prescribe and teach these things.
[time=3121] Look at verse 12, this is all that, keeping a good conscious part.
[time=3125] Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, purity, show yourself an example to those who believe, verse 13, until I can finally get there, give attention to the public reading of scripture, to exhortation and teaching.
[time=3142] Then about that he says, do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.
[time=3152] Take pains and be absorbed in these things so that your progress may be evident to all.
[time=3158] Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching.
[time=3162] He says, Timothy, as the leader of this flock caught in the middle of the city of Ephesus, you must teach the truth and you must live the truth and take pains with both.
[time=3172] Let it be the priority of your life that you are a man who can rightly divide the word of God as he says in Second Timothy, and that your life evidences that truth on a day-to-day basis.
[time=3183] It was horrible, last week or the week before.
[time=3188] I heard of yet another evangelical leader collapsing to adultery and it just rips at my heart.
[time=3196] I had studied this man's book in seminary.
[time=3200] It's called Unleashing the Church and it was a great new and informative, helpful work on adapting the ministry of the New Testament church in the 20th century and we read his books and we studied it and later on, even in life, my last church where I passed her before, there was a gal who moved from his area out of his church.
[time=3218] She had been a piano player there and she played the piano for us and I shook her hand with warmth and tenderness because she'd come from this man's ministry.
[time=3229] He fell, he had been in an eight-year-long adulterous affair and all the while we were looking to him and hoping for his leadership.
[time=3241] It's public, his name is Frank Telepah and the stuff that runs inside your soul when a man who is supposed to be leading the pack whose book you're studying has been conducting an eight-year affair.
[time=3255] It's not enough to preach the truth.
[time=3258] You must preach the truth and live the truth and when you do that, you lead a church through difficult days.
[time=3265] Before that it was Gordon McDonald, the man who also I had studied in some way idolized and been thankful for his ministry and he since collapsed and then they restored him and then he collapsed again and it just tears at your heart.
[time=3279] We're to be thankful for the men who are 50 and 60 years old
[time=3286] and still in the ministry and they are pursuing the gospel both in the truth to preach it and the life to live it.
[time=3292] They are cherished saints in our minds and that is what he is saying.
[time=3296] Timothy, you're a young man and you're caught in a vitally strategic ministry for the saints and the souls and the lives of Ephesus.
[time=3303] Teach the truth and live the truth.
[time=3309] And that's what he says to him.
[time=3310] It's an amazingly powerful message and the book is just dotted with it.
[time=3315] So this book of 1 Timothy is full of warnings against the false teachers and it just runs its way through the chapters.
[time=3322] And then the strategy, oh, Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, hang on to it, don't let it away from you and that is sprinkled also through these chapters.
[time=3331] And then there is a third element in the book and it's what he says to the church.
[time=3334] This is the role that you all play.
[time=3336] This is how you function in the church for the cause of Christ.
[time=3339] The first thing is to pray.
[time=3340] Look at it in chapter two.
[time=3343] Pray, it makes sense doesn't it?
[time=3346] It's just what a church ought to be doing when times get tough all the time frankly but especially when they're being attacked.
[time=3352] First of all, then I urge that you make in treaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings on behalf of all men for kings, verse two and all who are in authority in order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=3368] Look at verse three, this is good and acceptable the sight of God our Savior who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=3376] You're living in a hostile environment and the men who run your city have absolutely no sympathy or concern or moral base for the things of God and how are you to handle that?
[time=3385] You're to pray for them over and over and over and pray, pray, pray, pray for what?
[time=3390] For their salvation that they'll come to Christ that they'll see things differently and that at least that they'll give you the room to live a tranquil and a quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
