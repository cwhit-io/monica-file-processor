[time=0] The Bible says that Satan is a liar, in fact it calls him the father of lies.
[time=19] He hates the truth, he loves to sow the lies of heresy and take people to hell as they
[time=26] believe the wrong thing about God, about Jesus, about heaven, about hell, about salvation.
[time=33] One of the main manifestations of Satan's lying intent is his proliferation of false
[time=39] prophets.
[time=40] Stay with us this morning as we study the false prophets from 1 Timothy chapter 1.
[time=56] Welcome to the Bible hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=65] Thank you for joining us.
[time=67] Today Pastor Moore will continue his series of messages from the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=72] Russ has entitled today's message confronting false prophets.
[time=77] What rule does Satan play in our lives today?
[time=80] Is he really the father of lies?
[time=83] Should we be concerned about false prophets today?
[time=86] Have your Bible open to the first chapter of 1 Timothy as we study what the Apostle Paul had to say regarding these issues to his young student, Timothy.
[time=96] Before today's message we will be ministered to by special music from Becky Wollman entitled "Be Glad" and a solo from Kerry Johnson entitled "I Miss My Time With You."
[time=111] As we prepare our hearts for today's message, let's join the congregation as they sing that great hymn, "It Is Well With My Soul."
[time=140] [MUSIC]
[time=170] "It Is Well With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul"
[time=191] [MUSIC]
[time=206] "It Is Well With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul"
[time=234] [MUSIC - 12 seconds]
[time=268] "It Is Well With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul"
[time=294] "It Is Well With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul With My Soul"
[time=306] Thank you very much for your good singing today.
[time=309] We miss the choir. They are off for this one Sunday.
[time=312] We will begin our regular time again this Wednesday evening.
[time=316] If you're interested in joining our choir you can indicate that by signing a registration card
[time=322] to put choir on it or join us this Wednesday evening in the rehearsal room behind the sanctuary.
[time=328] Appreciate the ministry of the choir and their faithfulness and we look forward to their ministry again next week.
[time=334] Last Wednesday evening I had about 15 people sing solos in the choir room.
[time=339] We had a nice little concert together many of whom had never sung a solo here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=345] We are grateful and will be using some of those people this fall.
[time=348] Today Becky Woolman is going to come. This is the first time she sung for us as a soloist.
[time=353] We appreciate her ministry. The scripture in Psalm 100 says, "Worship the Lord with gladness." This is the title of her song is "Be a Glad, O.B.E. Glad."
[time=375] In these days of confused situations.
[time=381] In these nights of a restless remorse.
[time=387] When the heart and the soul of a nation.
[time=394] Lay wounded and cold as a corpse.
[time=400] From the grave of the innocent Adam.
[time=406] Come to song bringing joy to the sad.
[time=412] Oh, your cry has been heard and the ransom has been paid up in full.
[time=421] Be glad, O.B.E. glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=430] Every death that you ever had.
[time=437] Has been paid up in full by the great of the Lord.
[time=443] Be glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=451] Now from your dungeon a rumor history.
[time=458] And your eyes show the sorrow they've had.
[time=464] But this time that they'll keep their turning.
[time=470] He has opened the gates, be glad, O.B.E. glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=482] Every death that you ever had.
[time=488] Has been paid up in full by the great of the Lord.
[time=494] Be glad, O.B.E. glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=501] Don't be like lights on the rim of the water.
[time=512] Giving hope in a dawn we are the night.
[time=519] The refuge amiss, the blood of the fugitive in their flight.
[time=530] For you are timeless and part of a battle.
[time=536] You are with so many young at the lad.
[time=542] And there is no disease or no struggle.
[time=548] That can pull you from God.
[time=551] Gee, be glad, O.B.E. glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=561] Every death that you ever had.
[time=567] Has been paid up in full by the great of the Lord.
[time=573] Be glad, O.B.E. glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=579] O.B.E. glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=586] Every death that you ever had.
[time=592] Has been paid up in full by the great of the Lord.
[time=598] Be glad, O.B.E. glad, O.B.E. glad.
[time=609] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=616] We are glad that you have tuned in and I hope that you have already received a blessing from the music.
[time=620] The audience participation as we sang songs as we worshiped the Savior.
[time=625] Russ, this is the fall of the year and in Indiana weather changes very rapidly.
[time=629] Yesterday I was at a great soccer game where Black Hawk Christian won and it was very warm and you wake up this morning.
[time=635] It's very cool, so you can expect some radical changes in the next few days.
[time=639] We noticed this morning it was amazing and I thought to myself, is this it?
[time=643] I mean, is this the beginning of the cold stuff and I guess?
[time=646] No, I think it watched for about three more days and you'll see 90 degree weather again.
[time=652] This has changed Russ and speaking of change, we're gearing up for a lot of change in the fall of the year here.
[time=657] We have two special events that are coming up.
[time=660] The first one is on September 15th.
[time=662] That's Friend Day and we want to encourage our people to come and meet you in particular if they've never met you and just fellowship with us in that worshipful day.
[time=670] I'd look forward to that if the folks that are watching would choose to come by.
[time=674] I'd love to take a minute and we can chat and you can tell me about yourself and it'd be a wonderful time of fellowship.
[time=680] And also Russ, we've had some exciting times as we've followed the events that have taken place in Russia in recent weeks
[time=687] and we're going to have some first-hand information from a special guest that we'll have on September 29th.
[time=693] I am so excited about Dr. Bob Provost coming.
[time=696] He's with Send International and his ministry is to Russia.
[time=701] Interestingly enough, I guess three weeks ago, when the coup began, he had landed in Moscow
[time=707] and had been taking an all-night train ride from Moscow to Kiev and it was during that train ride that Gorbachev had been arrested.
[time=715] And so when he arrived at Kiev, he was notified of that and thought, of course, immediately about leaving the country, but the church leaders at the Baptist Church in Russia persuaded him to stay and in fact brought him back to Moscow where he could give strategic leadership to the Christians there.
[time=730] And I understand that many of the believers in Moscow were approaching the military, even climbing up on their tanks and handing them new testaments and handing five new testaments per tank, because I guess there's five guys in each one of those.
[time=743] And the reports are that the men in those tanks were young, 18, 19-year-old men who really didn't so much want to be doing this.
[time=750] And the Christians said, "If you get orders to shoot, well then go ahead and shoot, but shoot over our heads, shoot up into the sky." So it was a tremendous time of witness and testimony.
[time=759] Bob is now heading across Russia up into Siberia.
[time=764] He'll cross 11 time zones in that process.
[time=767] And he wants to get up there because there's a new avenue of ministry that's opening up for Send International.
[time=773] Send has a Bible college up in Alaska.
[time=776] And they also have a plane up there that is capable of flying to Russia and touch up there in Siberia and come back.
[time=782] And they have permission from the government and so they'll do that for the first time with Bob.
[time=787] And in the future, hope to bring five pastors a year to stay in Alaska for a couple of years, get the Bible trained.
[time=792] They need and then go back to Russia and minister.
[time=795] So it's exciting times.
[time=797] We're going to have an exciting time here, Russ.
[time=799] And I just want to remind you again that that day with Dr. Bob Provost is on Sunday morning September 29th,
[time=806] right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=808] He'll be speaking at the 915 service and the 1050 service.
[time=812] So two great events, September 15th and September 29th.
[time=816] Come and join us for those two days.
[time=819] And then speaking of Russia, I know that you've been there recently and you have some experiences that are worthwhile and on tape.
[time=827] That's right.
[time=828] We want to offer that tape to you who are watching the Bible hour.
[time=832] It is based on the scriptures.
[time=834] It's talking about Christian love and issue of the heart.
[time=837] But much of it is describing an experience that I had sharing the gospel on that very train ride from Moscow to Kiev.
[time=845] A Russian scientist who knew elementary English had struck up a conversation with me.
[time=851] We probably spoke for several hours on the train and had an opportunity to give him the full gospel.
[time=856] We've been pen pals ever since and we'd like for you to have an opportunity to hear that message and to get a little bit of the flavor of Russia as I experienced it.
[time=865] Or else I heard that story and I encourage all of our listeners to write in today.
[time=870] You can receive this cassette by simply writing to the Bible hour at 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=879] And the zip code is 46815.
[time=882] You didn't have a pencil and you have one now.
[time=884] I want to give you that address one more time.
[time=887] It's the Bible hour.
[time=888] 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=897] Well, we've had some good music already this morning.
[time=900] We'll have some more music and then I want you to stay tuned for an exciting series of messages that will continue today
[time=907] by our senior pastor Russell Moore.
[time=909] Stay tuned with us and enjoy the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=913] We'll speed up and get going full bore again.
[time=916] We just thank you for the ministries that you've blessed us with here at this church.
[time=919] And we praise now and we pray now as we reach the portion of the service where we give back to you
[time=925] a portion of that which you have just temporarily loaned to us.
[time=928] We pray that we would give generously and gladly.
[time=931] In Jesus' name that we pray, amen.
[time=943] There he was just waiting in our old familiar place.
[time=959] An empty spot beside him where ones are used to wait.
[time=967] To be filled with strength and wisdom for the battles of the day.
[time=977] I would have passed him by again, but I clearly heard him say.
[time=986] I miss my time with you. Those moments together I need to be with you each day.
[time=999] And it hurts me when you say you're too busy.
[time=1007] Busy trying to serve me. But how can you serve me when your spirit's empty?
[time=1020] There's a longing in my heart, wanting more than just a part of you.
[time=1028] It's true.
[time=1034] I miss my time with you.
[time=1044] What will I have to offer? How can I truly care?
[time=1052] My efforts have no meaning when your presence isn't there.
[time=1062] But you'll provide the power if I take time to pray.
[time=1070] I'll stay right here beside you and you'll never have to say.
[time=1080] I miss my time with you. Those moments together I need to be with you each day.
[time=1093] It hurts me when you say you're too busy. Busy trying to serve me.
[time=1104] But how can you serve me when your spirit's empty?
[time=1112] There's a longing in my heart, wanting more than just a part of you.
[time=1120] It's true.
[time=1126] I miss my time with you. I miss my time with you.
[time=1135] Those moments together I need to be with you each day.
[time=1143] And it hurts me when you say you're too busy. Busy trying to serve me.
[time=1154] But how can you serve me when your spirit's empty?
[time=1162] There's a longing in my heart, wanting more than just a part of you.
[time=1170] It's true.
[time=1176] I miss my time with you. It's true.
[time=1190] I miss my time with you.
[time=1207] Amen. Thank you for a good reminder. I do believe the Lord misses his time with us.
[time=1212] I believe he has longings. I believe that when we pursue him he's delighted with that.
[time=1222] If you have your Bible with you this morning I'll invite you to take it to 1 Timothy as we return to our study of this book.
[time=1228] I'm so thankful for the privilege of studying and preaching the Word of God and as a church that we can hold high the standard of the truth.
[time=1235] We'll be looking this morning, beginning actually to look at verses 3 through 11 in chapter 1.
[time=1241] And it might be helpful to be reminded, this is a book written by the Apostle Paul to his true child in the faith, Timothy, who he has instructed to remain on at Ephesus.
[time=1254] And Ephesus, as you remember, is a vibrant, in many ways, an opulent city on the western coast of Asia Minor sporting a thriving harbor that brings to the city all the commercial and cultural industry that makes it a city that is leading in the Roman Empire.
[time=1272] In the middle of it is the Temple Diana, or Artemis, as it is sometimes referred to, it was one of the seventh wonders of the world.
[time=1282] It was a fertility cult and serving that temple were many, actually thousands of male and female prostitutes.
[time=1292] The rank paganism which emanated from that place literally dominated the city with all of its debauchery and sexual immorality.
[time=1300] We believe the gospel came to the city of Ephesus for the first time with the Apostle Paul and Aquila and Priscilla on his second missionary journey.
[time=1309] He stayed only briefly and then left, leaving behind him Priscilla and Aquila to return on his third missionary journey where he stayed for three years.
[time=1318] And it was during that stay that he preached to them the whole council of God.
[time=1323] He gave them a huge deposit of truth, and as he was leaving he gathered the elders of Ephesus on the island of Miletus in Acts chapter 20 and he warned them, saying this,
[time=1335] "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock." I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock, and from among your own selves men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves.
[time=1352] Well that has happened, in fact Paul left and as hard as the elders tried they were unable to keep these savage wolves from wrecking havoc on the flock and now it has happened, they've come.
[time=1366] And they are referred to in verse three as certain men that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines.
[time=1374] They are again referred to in this chapter in verse 19, keeping faith and a good conscience which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
[time=1386] And then in verse 20 some of them are actually named, among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander.
[time=1393] No doubt Hymenaeus and Alexander's were leading the pack and Paul had instructed them in previous days about their false doctrine but they nevertheless represented a larger group, some men or certain men that must still be dealt with.
[time=1408] They are described in this book as ruthless men in chapter four they're spoken of as hypocrites, liars with a seared conscience.
[time=1417] In chapter six they are described as conceited and understanding nothing, and in contrast to them Paul sends Timothy, a man as you remember who was raised in the scriptures from his earliest days by his mother and his grandmother, a young man who has made a sincere and vibrant profession of faith in Jesus Christ
[time=1437] and who lives that faith to the place that he has a good reputation among the brethren.
[time=1442] And a young man who after his travels with Paul throughout the various journeys they traveled comes to the place where in Philippians chapter two Paul describes him as having a kindred spirit with Paul, namely that he is concerned genuinely for the welfare of others.
[time=1460] He has a great concern for the interests of Christ in a person's life, not his own selfish pursuits.
[time=1467] So he is sent to battle these wolves who have come to wreck havoc on the flock of God.
[time=1474] The battle was no doubt fierce, you'll see in verse three as I urge you remain.
[time=1480] It may have been that Timothy had made a second request, can I leave here, the battle is too hot, I want to find a different mission, give me a different assignment.
[time=1489] Timothy is somewhat I guess by nature timid and we believe that because of the description of him in 2 Timothy.
[time=1496] You might turn with me there, we'll look at a few different examples of the charges that Paul must give Timothy in his timidity to continue on at Ephesus.
[time=1506] 2 Timothy 1 verses 6 and following.
[time=1509] For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
[time=1516] For God has not given us a spirit of timidity but of power and love and discipline.
[time=1523] Verse 8, "Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God."
[time=1534] He had a very difficult assignment, these false prophets were probably older than he was and maybe a little more eloquent and certainly more bold and he wanted out.
[time=1544] And so Paul says, "No, you can't go, you've got to kindle afresh the gift of God, you're preaching gift because God has not given us the spirit of timidity but of power."
[time=1554] And he says, "Stay, remain on and do not be ashamed of the testimony." He describes or charges him in that strength in chapter 2.
[time=1564] Look at it, verse 1, "You therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
[time=1570] And then he gives him three pictures of strength that he should have.
[time=1574] One in verse 3, "Suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
[time=1580] Another in verse 5, "If anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules."
[time=1587] And then in verse 6, a third picture, "The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops."
[time=1594] He says, "Be strong Timothy, you can't go and let me give you illustrations of strength in the natural world that of the soldier, the athlete and the farmer."
[time=1605] He's bolstering his courage and his strength.
[time=1609] Over in chapter 3, verses 13 and 14, "Evil men and imposters will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
[time=1621] Verse 14, "You however continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them."
[time=1629] Continue on, don't give up.
[time=1632] And then lastly in chapter 4, verses 1 and 2, "I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom preach the Word.
[time=1645] Be ready in season and out of season.
[time=1648] Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction."
[time=1654] So, "Timothy, apparently somewhat timid by nature, receives these two letters as great encouragement and strength to continue on in a fierce battle for truth at the church at Ephesus."
[time=1670] Go back with me now to 1 Timothy and let's look at chapter 3, verse 15.
[time=1674] This is really the thesis statement of the letter.
[time=1677] This is the reason in clear form for which Paul has written, 3.15.
[time=1683] But in case I am delayed, I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself and the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=1696] And this is the legacy of any great church to be a bastion of truth, to be a guardian and defender of the faith, to lift high the standard of God and proclaim it, loud and clear, the inspired, in errant, and therefore authoritative Word of God, which is the final standard in all of faith and practice.
[time=1718] He says, "Timothy, you must teach them how to conduct themselves and the household of God, for you the church are the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=1728] Where would we be without the truth?" And so on a human level, it is Paul writing to Timothy to remain at Ephesus and instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines.
[time=1743] But we could easily back up from the human drama, if you will, and find another behind the scenes that of the spiritual warfare that is going on.
[time=1752] Reminded that Ephesians chapter 6 says that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[time=1761] John chapter 8 verse 44 says that Satan is a murderer and that he is a liar, and in that his entire scheme is laid bare before us.
[time=1769] He longs to kill people and to devour them, he roams about the earth like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour, and hear the word devour means to suck down whole, much like a snake devours its prey, going back to his other comparison to an animal, not always a lion, but a serpent, the deceptive serpent who would suck people down wholly and destroy them in death and hell forever.
[time=1796] And he does that by propagating lies, by telling false cities about the truth of the scripture and perverting and twisting it so that people buy into something other than the truth and find themselves condemned forever and hell.
[time=1810] And one of the main manifestations of Satan's lying intent is his proliferation of false prophets. These are his avenue by which he does that.
[time=1821] And so the Spirit of God through Paul directs Timothy to wage a war for truth at Ephesus, and as the truth of God is proclaimed, people are snatched out of the hands of Satan, if you will, as they're extricated from this demonic, satanic worship in the temple
[time=1838] in Indiana, they come to the knowledge of the truth, they come to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and they receive life, life forever, life eternal, and it bothers Satan because he loves death, and he is a liar, and there is no truth in him, he is in fact the father of lies.
[time=1855] And he sees that his territory is being eroded by the truth of God, and he wants it back, and so he sends his false prophets, his false teachers, his heretics, from within and from without to attack the truth of God.
[time=1867] In hopes that the people will turn from the truth, continue to believe the lie, and they will die, die in their sins, which is the greatest delight of his heart.
[time=1877] He is a wicked, wicked being, and his ambassadors are these false prophets.
[time=1886] So Paul and Timothy intersect with that spiritual warfare on a human level around the city of Ephesus as they combat these false teachers.
[time=1896] And Paul says remain on, remain on at Ephesus to instruct.
[time=1902] The word instruct is a military term, it's a strong order of command that is not open for debate, he doesn't mean to dialogue with these men or to debate with them, just simply tell them to cease and to desist.
[time=1916] What they are doing is damning, and in his instruction to Timothy he highlights three elements of heresy, or three perspectives about heresy, and they fill up verses 3 through 11.
[time=1931] We'll study them under these headings, heresy in content verses 3 and 4, heresy in contrast, verse 5, and heresy in case and point verses 6 through 11.
[time=1946] And we'll probably be looking at these this Lord's day and next.
[time=1951] Let's begin with heresy in content verses 3 and 4, follow along as I read.
[time=1959] As I urged you upon my departure from Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines.
[time=1971] Nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God, which is by faith.
[time=1981] Strange doctrines, hetero didoscalon in the Greek, it's a word that Paul coined himself, it's used here, and in the same book chapter 6 verse 3 only these two places and all the New Testament to describe strange doctrine, hetero, meaning diverse or different as a prefix, along with doctrine.
[time=2000] What these men are teaching you is a different, a strange, a diverse doctrine than what I had entrusted to you.
[time=2007] Of the three fundamental forms of heresy combating the early church, there was Judiistic heresy, Gnostic heresy and syncretistic heresy.
[time=2017] What appears to be in view here is the Judiistic heresy. Look down at verse 7.
[time=2022] These men are wanting to be teachers of the law, capital L, the Old Testament, even though they don't understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
[time=2032] These are men who would have held to circumcision and the observance of the whole moral and ceremonial law as perrequisites of salvation.
[time=2042] They are trying to compromise and so unify the message of Christianity that they indeed mutilate the true grace of God and tie it to the law of God.
[time=2054] They are imposters. They come as wolves in sheep's clothing. They are referred to in Matthew chapter 7 and it's an interesting note.
[time=2062] These are not wolves that have dressed themselves up as sheep and then sneak on into the flock looking like a sheep.
[time=2069] Sheep's clothing is wool and it's what a shepherd wore.
[time=2073] They come as false prophets. They are wolves in shepherd's clothing or in sheep's clothing.
[time=2078] They are dressed in the wool garment of a shepherd. They look like a teacher. They talk like a teacher.
[time=2083] They make confident assertions about the law. They come in their deceptive role as alleged prophets of truth and instead they spread heresy in lies which damn people to hell.
[time=2094] And therein is their subtlety. They handle the word of God. They just handle it inaccurately.
[time=2102] Their teaching appears to be biblical and true but it is not and it pulls away the unwary soul.
[time=2109] They turn their minds, look at verse 4, nor to pay attention which is a Greek word that means to turn your mind or to focus on something different than you were before.
[time=2118] Nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. And with this little phrase myths and endless genealogy were introduced to the entire world of Jewish lore and tradition.
[time=2131] The rabbis would sit on hours on end spinning their tails about the Old Testament. And they did it through the genealogies and myths that they would create.
[time=2142] Post-exilic Judaism had a keen, almost fanatical interest in the genealogies of the Old Testament, the lists of names.
[time=2149] And they would break these lists up and they would number them and order them and try to find elliptical hidden meaning out of the order and the number of how many names were in that given list as opposed to this other list.
[time=2159] And out of that they would spend these allegorical speculations that had no end. There was no end to it all.
[time=2166] One such example would have put in their book of Jubilee which was a commentary on the period of the beginning of the world until the people found their way into the Promised Land.
[time=2176] And they took the number 7 as the divine number and somehow imposed it as an interpretive grid on all the revealed truth through the Pentateuch on up to Joshua.
[time=2186] And what they came out with were astronomical conclusions that the Sabbath, for example, had always been observed by ark angels and that angels themselves practiced circumcision and that Jacob never tricked anybody.
[time=2199] And on and on and on this bizarre list of interpretations and teaching has alleged truth comes out.
[time=2205] They were using the Scripture but they were wrongly understanding it, wrongly interpreting it and therefore wrongly applying it.
[time=2212] And it has gone on through the years and it is still going on today and it was going on in Timothy's day.
[time=2219] Pope Gregory the Great used such an interpretive scheme for the book of Job.
[time=2227] He was fighting the anti-Catholics of his day and so he took an allegorical, unbiblical approach to Scripture and in particular to the book of Job.
[time=2236] He said this, that Job's three friends represent heretics.
[time=2241] And now listen to how strange this gets, the seven sons, Job's seven sons are the twelve apostles.
[time=2247] Now add that up, seven sons are the twelve apostles.
[time=2251] The seven hundred sheep are God's faithful people.
[time=2254] The three thousand humpback camels are of the depraved Gentiles.
[time=2258] I mean you go anywhere you want as soon as you begin to impose your own understanding and make it all allegorical and develop these myths and these genealogies and it just goes on and on and on.
[time=2269] Recently I heard of a situation on a TV, Christian TV talk show type thing and the host and hostess were interviewing an individual and asking him all kinds of questions and finally it came out that he was born in 1929.
[time=2282] And the guest said I was born in 1920, God had me to be born in 1929 because that's my life verse.
[time=2289] Matthew 19-29 and everybody went oh this is wonderful, this is amazing.
[time=2296] And what does Matthew 19-29 say? It says this, with men it is impossible but with God all things are possible.
[time=2304] And again oh they go crazy what a life verse, oh that's amazing. And so the host says well well then I was born in 1934, that will be my life verse.
[time=2314] Look up honey look up Matthew 19-34 and she gets there and of course Matthew 19 doesn't even have 34 verses which left him in a little bit of a difficult spot.
[time=2324] So they hunted through the New Testament to find one and Mark only doesn't even have 19 chapters which left them with Luke.
[time=2331] Luke 19-34 that will be it, that will be my life verse and so she reads it.
[time=2336] It says this and Jesus said I have need of him, I have need of him, he's all marvelous.
[time=2343] I've got my life verse you see there it is, Jesus has need of me.
[time=2349] But his wife would continue to read the context, she looked up from us and says no wait it's talking about a jackass.
[time=2358] It's true and I don't know maybe that is his life verse, who am I to say?
[time=2364] But when you come to the scriptures with a fanciful myth and genealogy it just it's endless.
[time=2371] Where does it ever stop and the one story is piled upon another story and a myth upon a myth and a legend upon a legend and the end is never in sight.
[time=2380] They are like the Athenians of Acts chapter 17 verse 21 now all the Athenians and the strangers visiting there used to spend their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.
[time=2392] The concern was not for truth for something new, something spectacular.
[time=2398] Well what does it all add up to?
[time=2401] Look back at verses 3 and 4 these men they come teaching strange doctrine, different doctrine, diverse doctrine by focusing their attention and their listeners attention not upon the scriptures but upon myths and endless genealogies.
[time=2416] Now what does it result in which give rise to mere speculation, speculate it adds up to nothing.
[time=2424] It's just more speculation, conclusions are never reached, truth is never proclaimed, people are immobilized by the quest for truth but never come to it they are ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=2438] It's just endless cycle of myth and genealogy and fable and tradition and they just feel free to make up all they need because their interpretive methods are so broad and it goes on and on and on and that is always the case with heresy.
[time=2454] Heresy will always represent a strange doctrine, it will always be different than the fundamental truth once and for all delivered to the saints.
[time=2462] It will always come because people set their mind not on the scriptures but on some man-made, man concocted, manufactured element that is injected into scripture and here it's a myth and endless genealogy and in other heresies it's different things but it's always a focus off the scriptures onto some man-made interpretation.
[time=2481] And it always leads to nothing, nothing, you never get there, the end is never in sight and when you think you've arrived you've gone no further than when you started, you're still lost.
[time=2494] I used to sell for my dad orthopedics and in the process I would have to go to all these different cities and I didn't always have a map.
[time=2504] Now I knew I was supposed to go because I had the address but I didn't always have the map and I'd show up at this city and I'd look around, I couldn't find so I'd stop and ask a guy in a gas station, and he'd say okay, three lights this way, take a left, two lights that way, take a right, there's a McDonald's turn right, it's right there.
[time=2519] And you know, you have to hear enough of those things, anyway so you go down three, you go down two and you think you did all this right and you get to where the McDonald's supposed to be, there's nothing.
[time=2527] You're not there, now you're more lost than you were before and you really don't know if it was his fault or your fault.
[time=2532] It's just all lostness and you follow his instructions and now you're more lost than you were before, never coming to the knowledge of the truth, which brings us to the contracts, heresy and contracts.
[time=2546] What should teaching produce, what should we find at the end of the road when we follow the sound doctrine of basic Bible teaching?
[time=2556] Well the last part of verse four, rather than furthering the administration of God, which is by faith, you see there teaching leads to speculation.
[time=2566] What you're teaching, Timothy should produce, is the furthering of the administration of God which is by faith. Now what does that mean? The word administration could have been translated plan, it's the plan of God by faith, namely salvation.
[time=2578] The true and sincere preaching of the word of God should lead to more than speculation, it should lead you to the ultimate destiny of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, get saved and have life.
[time=2590] Instead, for the heretic, it's speculation. Now it's even further defined in verse five, but the goal of our instruction is love, love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=2608] Agape, in the Greek, the word for love there, you're familiar with it, it's the word that describes love of choice or love of will, that self-denying, self-sacrificing, volitional choice that we as believers can make because the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts and the spirit of God indwells us.
[time=2626] And we are impelled and compelled to love each other and to love God. And we say about our lives, I am not on this planet for my own sake and for my own purposes. I am here because I want to live for the benefit of God and the benefit of man and the benefit of my brother and the benefit of the lost.
[time=2644] I am serving, I am loving, I am giving sacrificially. For God so loved the world that He gave, they're in the definition of love, to give your life for God.
[time=2660] That is true. In Matthew 22, Jesus was confronted by, I think it was described in the Pharisees and they said, which is the greatest commandment? Which is the greatest law out of all this stuff in the Old Testament? Which one has priority? And they were trying to of course trap Him. It was a lawyer in fact, it was trying to do this. The text reveals.
[time=2678] And so it was probably a very technical discussion in nature and Jesus just simplified the whole thing.
[time=2683] I'll tell you what the greatest thing is. Love. It's all kept in this one thing that you'll love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and you'll love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=2694] What he is saying is, and what Paul is saying to Timothy is that the whole sum total of all that God has ever written comes down to this one goal, this one end. The goal of our instruction is love.
[time=2708] Love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. When Paul wrote to the Saints at Ephesus in Ephesians chapter 2, let me read what he said.
[time=2718] He says this, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend what is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth and to know the love of Christ.
[time=2736] The product is love and what Paul says there is that when you are so overcome and overpowered and immersed in the reality of the love of Christ for you, you will love others.
[time=2746] And there will be a self-sacrificing willingness to give your life away in the service of other people and that should mark the product of your preaching, Timothy, as opposed to those who sit around and do nothing but speculate and who are actually immobilized in that speculation.
[time=2765] It's interesting that he offers this as a litmus test, if you will, of these false prophets. Jesus did the same thing. In Matthew chapter 7, he said, "Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
[time=2780] And he says this, "You will know them by their fruit." In other words, they're going to come looking like a shepherd, they're going to come looking like a preacher or a teacher, and they're going to have a staff or a rod in their hand, and they're going to have on the sheep's clothing.
[time=2793] And you're wondering, "Now, how do I know? How do I deserve?" And Jesus offers the product as a discerning point, their fruit.
[time=2805] Speculation versus love. Speculation versus love. And that's so natural in our thinking because we understand that the false doctrine cannot transform a life.
[time=2817] False doctrine cannot change a heart. False doctrine cannot renew a mind. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
[time=2828] A person who comes preaching false doctrine has no power in his words or in his preaching that the Spirit of God can energize to transform the life, cleanse the heart, cleanse the conscience, and produce a godly living lifestyle.
[time=2840] Notice it there in verse 5, "It is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."
[time=2848] False doctrine has no power over such things or to produce such things, only speculation, emptiness.
[time=2858] Not only do they not have that as fruit in their ministry, they don't even have that in their own lives.
[time=2863] Would you go with me to 2 Peter for a minute? 2 Peter chapter 2, and find here a description, a little more detailed description of the kind of things that go on inside the heart and mind and conscience of a false prophet?
[time=2878] Well, these are certainly not the same men, but they would be categorized in the same group. 2 Peter chapter 2, verse 10, "Those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority,
[time=2901] they are daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic magisties."
[time=2908] Look at verse 12, "But these, like unreasoning animals born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, they have no knowledge.
[time=2918] They are creatures also to be destroyed." Verse 13, "Suffering wrong as the wages of doing wrong, they count it pleasure to revel in the daytime.
[time=2926] They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions as they corouse with you, having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls,
[time=2938] having a heart trained and greed, their accursed children, forsaking the right way they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balam, the son of Betor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness."
[time=2951] These are wicked, wicked men. They know nothing of a pure heart, nothing of a clean, clear conscience, and nothing of a pure faith.
[time=2965] And their fruit knows nothing of it as well.
[time=2973] So come back with me now to 1 Timothy.
[time=2979] The battle is waging a mighty war and the battle is for truth. Timothy stay and hold on to the Church of God, which is the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=2995] Remain on at Ephesus in order that you may instruct them, command them, that they should not teach these strange doctrines, these different doctrines,
[time=3005] nor pay attention to myths and endless genealogies focusing the mind on man-made, concocted, manufactured falsehood that takes away from the proper interpretation of Scripture,
[time=3017] and which leads only to mere speculation.
[time=3022] What should it lead to, heresy in contrast, the furthering of the administration or the plan of God which is by faith, and we could add unto salvation.
[time=3031] Men and women would come to know the living Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3036] The goal of our instruction? Love. Love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=3044] Let me take you to one other place in the Scriptures just as we're closing to illustrate this. Go to Matthew chapter 15.
[time=3050] You'll find the contrast between what false doctrine produces and what the truth should produce.
[time=3067] Then some Pharisees, Matthew 15, one I'm following, then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem saying, why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
[time=3077] For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread, and of course that was not the law of God that they had to do that.
[time=3085] It was man-made tradition, some more of these myths and this additional stuff that gets recorded in the Talmud as to what is proper behavior.
[time=3093] Verse 3, "And he answered and said to them, 'And why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?'
[time=3101] For God said, 'Honor your father and mother, and he who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'
[time=3108] But you say, 'Whoever shall say to his father or mother anything of mine you might have been helped by has been given to God, he is not to honor his father or his mother.'
[time=3119] And thus you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites!'
[time=3126] Then he goes on to give him a scathing denunciation.
[time=3129] They were coming to him saying, 'Your disciples aren't washing their hands, you see they're breaking the law of God.' And in fact it wasn't the law of God, it was just mere tradition and his disciples had no responsibility whatsoever to do that.
[time=3141] And he looks at them and he says, 'But you are violating the law of God.' And they had developed some oath system or some way for younger people to give away their money to the church so to speak or to the synagogue or to God.
[time=3154] But then eventually be able to get it back because they didn't want to have to use those funds right now to care for their aging and dying parents.
[time=3162] And so it was actually a commitment to their own material wealth and they were using it under the guise of religion to find some pseudo acceptable way to let their parents go without their proper and deserved help.
[time=3175] And in that the law of love is clearly violated.
[time=3179] Who should you love more than your mother and your father?
[time=3182] Who should you care for more in the world than them, beyond your wife and your kids?
[time=3187] They brought you into the world. They cared for you when you couldn't care for yourself.
[time=3193] But when this heresy is taught and it's based on myths and endless genealogies it gives rise to speculation, not the furthering of the kingdom of God which the goal of which is love.
[time=3205] And so for all the community to see that one unique relationship of all the people who should be cared for in their dying years that ought to be your parents.
[time=3214] But they had found a way around it through their myths and their genealogies and they were able to keep a hold of their filthy looker.
[time=3222] And at the appropriate time they would reverse the vow and have the money.
[time=3226] The law of God is violated.
[time=3231] So it is Timothy stands against a mighty force of false doctrine. He's a young man. He's timid. He's scared.
[time=3239] And Paul says, "But my son, listen to me. Do you understand what these men are doing?
[time=3244] Do you understand how lethal they are? How dangerous they are?
[time=3249] You must remain and you must command by the authority that I give you as an apostle of Jesus Christ to stop them from doing that.
[time=3257] All it gives rise to is speculation.
[time=3261] Instead, Timothy, let your life and your teaching show the real goal of true doctrine, love from a pure heart, a clean conscience, and a sincere faith."
[time=3273] Let's pray together.
[time=3278] Father, we as a church would want to be faithful to this concept of being a pillar in support of the truth.
[time=3287] We are so thankful that through the years it has done that, that it is known for its commitment to the Word of God,
[time=3295] that our A.B.Fs are full of the preaching and the teaching and the study of the Word of God and that our Sunday morning services are devoted to the heralding of truth.
[time=3306] Father, we know that our day is corrupt and that there are false teachers that are running rampant through what is loosely called evangelical Christianity.
[time=3315] And there are men who are perverse and they are liars and they are hypocrites and they would take away the unwary soul.
[time=3325] Father, we pray this morning that you would guard us from that, that you would give us through the Spirit of God, divine protection,
[time=3332] that we would be those who would stand for the truth and only the truth.
[time=3338] And Father, we would want that truth to come to its logical and natural end in our lives.
[time=3344] We cannot allow it to slip into cold orthodoxy.
[time=3347] We must remain hot of heart, fervent in spirit as we love each other and love you and even as was sung this morning that we would see you as a vital relationship.
[time=3357] And when we miss our time with you, you long for that because this isn't just the keeping of certain didactic principles.
[time=3365] This is entering into a relationship with God, founded on truth and lived in truth and held in truth.
[time=3371] But it culminates in love, love for you and love for one another and love for the lost.
[time=3378] Father, spread this word far and wide and the hearts of those who call Blackhawk their home, let it find itself deeply seated in our hearts,
[time=3387] that you would be glorified, that you would be honored, that you would be lifted up and will praise you and thank you for these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
