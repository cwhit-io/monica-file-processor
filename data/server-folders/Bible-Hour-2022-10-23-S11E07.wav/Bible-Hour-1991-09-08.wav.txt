[time=16] If you were to die today and stand before God and he were to ask you why should I let you into my heaven?
[time=24] How would you respond?
[time=25] What would your answer be?
[time=27] Stay with us this morning. We're going to be looking at one of the most common answers given by most people.
[time=33] And it's wrong.
[time=35] [MUSIC]
[time=49] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship.
[time=54] Thank you for joining us.
[time=56] Today Pastor Moore will continue his series of messages from the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=61] Today's message is entitled Confronting False Prophets Part 2.
[time=65] It seems like such a simple question. Why should I let you into my heaven?
[time=70] But the answer that most people would give is incorrect.
[time=73] In today's message we will learn the correct answer to that seemingly simple question.
[time=78] Have your Bible open to the first chapter of 1 Timothy as we continue our studies in this timely series.
[time=85] Before today's message we will be ministered to by special music from celebration entitled Let us Praise the Almighty.
[time=94] And a solo from Brian Losen entitled More Than Wonderful.
[time=101] As we prepare our hearts for today's message, let's join Kevin Rowe and the sanctuary choirs they sing a rousing hymn entitled Right Now is the Right Time.
[time=112] [MUSIC]
[time=121] Why put off for tomorrow? What we could be doing today?
[time=128] You see the God we serve is right now God.
[time=132] And right now he's in this place. So let us thank him while we can.
[time=140] For tomorrow we might not have this chance.
[time=144] This is the hour and the time is right for everybody to praise the Lord to praise the Lord.
[time=152] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=185] We look forward to the future.
[time=189] But tomorrow may never be.
[time=193] And the past is all behind us.
[time=196] It's just a part of history.
[time=200] So let us thank him while we can.
[time=204] For tomorrow we might not have this chance.
[time=208] You see this is the hour and the time is right for everybody to praise the Lord.
[time=214] Come on and praise the Lord.
[time=216] Right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=221] [MUSIC]
[time=224] Right now is the right time.
[time=227] Enjoy what the Lord has done.
[time=231] There's no better time than the present.
[time=234] There's no better time than for raising a thumb towards heaven.
[time=237] [MUSIC]
[time=247] Now he has given us this moment.
[time=253] We'll never pass this way again.
[time=257] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=261] Let us rejoice and be glad.
[time=266] Right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=270] Yeah, oh yeah.
[time=273] Right now is the right time.
[time=276] Rejoice what the Lord has done.
[time=280] There's no better time than the present.
[time=283] There's no better time than for raising a thumb towards heaven.
[time=287] Right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=293] [MUSIC]
[time=296] Right now is the right time.
[time=299] Rejoice what the Lord has done.
[time=302] There's no better time than the present.
[time=307] There's no better time than for raising a thumb towards heaven.
[time=311] Right now is the right time.
[time=313] Come on, praise the Lord.
[time=315] Right now is the right time.
[time=317] Come on, help us.
[time=318] Right now is the right time.
[time=325] Right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=330] Rejoice.
[time=334] There's no better time than to praise the Lord.
[time=342] [APPLAUSE]
[time=347] Come to praise him for what he's done for us.
[time=351] Come Christians join to sing.
[time=353] 108, please.
[time=354] We'll sing all three verses of 108.
[time=358] [MUSIC - 103 seconds]
[time=481] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=483] Again, we appreciate it when you get yourself involved in worshiping the Lord through music.
[time=489] We always have special guests in our services and we're glad for that.
[time=493] We welcome all of you that are visiting for the first time.
[time=496] A number of our students that have graduated from high school have gone on to colleges around the country.
[time=503] A number of them will be going to Cedarville College in a few days.
[time=506] And this weekend, Cedarville College's women's volleyball team was in a tournament here and they're visiting us in our worship service today.
[time=513] We'd like to recognize them. Would you stand, ladies?
[time=516] And let's welcome them to Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=519] [APPLAUSE]
[time=524] Thank you very much and we wish you well in your year of playing together and I hope it'll be a great season for you.
[time=531] We continue to pray for our young people who are going off to school wherever they may go that God will bless them as they prepare for further service for him.
[time=540] We continue with music now.
[time=542] As the celebration comes, let's listen to them as they minister to us and open your hearts as they sing for us.
[time=550] [MUSIC - 92 seconds]
[time=657] [APPLAUSE]
[time=662] Hello, and welcome to the Bible Hour today. We're really glad that you tuned in. Russell, we are right in the throes of being very involved in new programs for the fall, and I'm glad for that. I'm glad for the routine again.
[time=674] Well, it definitely comes out of the summer slumps, if you will, and we're running fast and furious and looking forward to a great year.
[time=680] Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced to our people a men's retreat on September 28th. That's an exciting time for our men to get together.
[time=688] And this week, we talked with members of the Send International, where Bob Provost, our speaker for that weekend, is involved, and he's been really involved as it relates to Russia.
[time=702] The Lord is using him in a remarkable way, and we did learn this week that he's finally come back from Russia, and he's up in Send International, which is up in Michigan, of course.
[time=711] And he's looking forward to coming and doing not only our retreat, but being with us for the Bible Hour and speaking, and I believe it's going to be an exciting Sunday for us.
[time=718] I want you to put that date on your calendar. It's September 29th. That's a Sunday morning here at Blackhawk Baptist Church. We'd love to have you take that time and come.
[time=728] This is going to be in a very enlightening day as we listen to the events that have taken place most recently in the Soviet Union.
[time=736] Right there, first-hand Bob Provost was there during that coup, and he'll have some wonderful stories to tell us and some things that have changed and will change the lives of those Russian people.
[time=748] So come and join with us on Sunday morning, September 29th. That's going to be a great day.
[time=754] And then I want to tell our listeners, Russ, about the Three River Sunday School Convention. We happen to host it here at Blackhawk Baptist Church, but there are a number of people that are involved, and that is on that same weekend.
[time=765] On Saturday, September 28th, and Russ, it just involves Sunday school, and how to be more effective teacher from the cradle roll right up to the senior adults, and we have a great lineup of speakers for that weekend.
[time=780] You know, I think that the Sunday school workers are absolutely essential to the growth of any church, and if you're considering becoming a Sunday school teacher, maybe you're not even a Sunday school teacher yet, but you know that you have needs in your church, this will be a great way to begin.
[time=794] Your ministry to come and to be trained at a Saturday session, such as this, and then to approach somebody in your church and say, "I'm ready. I want to help. I know we need over 45 workers for a WANA. We're anticipating over 270 kids for our program, and we're currently recruiting in our own church for about 40 or 50 people to teach and to listen and to run games and to do all the things, and it's an invaluable ministry in any given church."
[time=820] You know, Russ, I don't know one church in the United States, regardless of the size that doesn't need workers for young people, and that's where we get that initial basic training in the Word of God, and it's so important.
[time=832] So let me give you that date once again, that Saturday, September 28th, right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, will be the annual Three Rivers Sunday School Convention.
[time=842] I'm going to give you a telephone number two. If you have an opportunity, you might call for some more questions. The area code is 219. The number is 749-9758.
[time=855] I hope that you have the opportunity to call and ask about the program for that day. It'll be a very rewarding time for you if you're a Sunday school teacher.
[time=864] Russ, we always have the opportunity to present a gift offer, some things that really help people in their spiritual lives. We have something for the people during the month of December.
[time=874] Well, kind of staying with our theme of Russia in light of Bob Provost's arrival, we're offering a tape of a message that I delivered at Grace Community Church about a year ago, just as I had returned from the ministry in the Soviet Union.
[time=889] I'd been invited there to speak with about 2000 Collegians from the Baptist Union Church, and we met out in the middle of the Carpathian Mountains in very rustic conditions,
[time=899] and I was to give biblical principles for evangelism, public evangelism, which was something they can do now, openly canvassing streets and homes with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=910] They had a tremendous time, and moving from Moscow to the Carpathian Mountains, it involved a long, all night train ride, and on the return trip I met a Russian scientist who spoke English, and we probably spent three and a half hours together on this train ride,
[time=927] and he was just pumping me with questions and seeking information about the Word of God and about Christ, and it's all captured in this tape,
[time=934] and so it might be interesting to you to gain some first-hand experience into witnessing in personal evangelism in the Soviet Union.
[time=944] Well, thanks Russ. We want to give this tape to you, and I hope you have a pencil right now, and we'll write the address down so you can receive this tape today.
[time=953] Please write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=970] You can just ask for the tape by Russell Moore, the issues of the heart, and write for it today, and let us know that you're watching the Bible Hour.
[time=978] It's a great encouragement to us, and Russ, it is, as we receive letters, we are encouraged by people that watch the Bible,
[time=985] or particularly shut-ins, that can't make it to their local church.
[time=989] Out that you'll stay with us today for the remainder of our program, we go back for some more music, and then the message from the Word of God from our pastor, Russell Moore.
[time=997] Stay with us, won't you?
[time=1002] He promised us that he would be a counselor, a mighty God and a prince of peace.
[time=1017] He promised us that he would be a father, and would love us with a love that would not cease.
[time=1031] Well, I tried him, and I found his promises are true.
[time=1039] He's everything he said that he would be.
[time=1046] The finest words I know could not begin to tell, just how much Jesus really means to me.
[time=1063] For he's more wonderful than my mind can conceive, he's more wonderful than my heart can believe.
[time=1081] He goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams.
[time=1095] He's everything that my soul ever long for, everything he's promised and so much more, more than amazing, more than marvel us, more than miraculous could ever be.
[time=1122] He's more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me.
[time=1146] I stand amazed to think the king of glory, would come to live within the heart of man.
[time=1160] I marvel just to know he really loves me, when I think of who he is and who I am.
[time=1175] For he's more wonderful than my mind can conceive, he's more wonderful than my heart can believe.
[time=1194] He goes beyond my highest hopes and fondest dreams.
[time=1208] He's everything that my soul ever long for, everything he's promised and so much more, more than amazing, more than marvel us, more than miraculous could ever be.
[time=1236] He's more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me.
[time=1250] He's everything that my soul ever long for, everything he's promised and so much more, more than amazing, more than marvel us, more than miraculous could ever be.
[time=1278] He's more than wonderful, more than wonderful, that's what Jesus is to me.
[time=1296] He's more than wonderful, more than perfect life to me.
[time=1310] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1317] Thank you, Brian, a beautiful song.
[time=1320] Well, as we continue in our worship this morning of our great and awesome God, I invite you to take your Bible and open it to 1 Timothy.
[time=1328] 1 Timothy chapter 1, where we'll be studying again these verses 3 through 11, a vital passage of Scripture dealing with confronting false prophets, false teachers.
[time=1343] And as we have been studying this book for the last several weeks, we have found ourselves in a drama of sorts between two young, well one young man and his mentor against the forces of wickedness in spiritual places.
[time=1356] Paul is the mentor, the apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior.
[time=1363] He is a true warrior for the things of God and he has gone through incredible experiences, having been converted by Jesus Christ on the Damascus road and since that day being filled with the knowledge of Jesus Christ and pursuing the progress of the gospel of Jesus Christ all over his known world.
[time=1383] In his travelings, he came to meet a young man by the name of Timothy. In fact, he may have brought Timothy to the Lord. We don't know that for sure.
[time=1390] We know that Timothy had a godly mother and a grandmother in Lois and Eunice who raised him in the things of the Lord, but at some point he came to know Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and had a sincere and godly faith.
[time=1403] Paul also learned of Timothy that he had a good and sound reputation among the brethren. He was well respected even as a young man and Paul no doubt saw a level of giftedness and natural talent and spiritual gifts there and out of that awareness asked him to accompany him in his missionary journeys which he did.
[time=1423] And there the discipleship process began. Paul took Timothy under his wing and they would travel from city to city and they would talk and they would eat together and they would go through all the trying circumstances.
[time=1436] Through all of this, Paul had come to an intimate knowledge of his disciple Timothy. He knew his strengths and he knew his weaknesses.
[time=1443] And in writing in Philippians chapter 2 to the saints at Philippi Paul said of Timothy you are a kindred spirit of mine. You have a genuine concern for the welfare of other people.
[time=1456] And that was of ultimate concern in Paul's heart because then as is now men have come and wanted to be teachers and wanted to take the position of leadership who were not genuinely concerned for the welfare of others but instead were driven to that place of leadership
[time=1471] by a self-interest and self-promoting self-aggrandizing interest but with Timothy it was not that way.
[time=1479] And Timothy Paul had a young man of a kindred spirit who was genuinely concerned for the welfare of others.
[time=1487] And Paul approaching this strategic point in his life, his life is about over and one of the churches that he had ministered to for three years the church at Ephesus he had made a huge
[time=1499] depository of truth there was now under attack.
[time=1505] Ephesus was a fascinating city. It was blessed with a thriving harbor as it rested on the western coast of Asia Minor.
[time=1514] And with that harbor came the cultural and materialistic fruitfulness that it often accompanies such a place.
[time=1521] At the center of it all was the temple Diana one of the seventh wonders of the ancient world that dominated the culture of that city.
[time=1528] It spread paganism like gangrene and the temple itself was populated by temple prostitutes. It was a fertility cult.
[time=1535] It was as gross and debauched as any false system could be.
[time=1540] And it reached its long tentacles into the outermost parts of that city and literally dominated it in darkness.
[time=1547] And Paul came to that city and preached the gospel of Jesus Christ and a church was born.
[time=1552] He came back later and spent three years there as I said, proclaiming to them the whole council of God.
[time=1557] And when he had finished he gathered the elders of Ephesus onto a little island, the island of Miletus and said,
[time=1563] "Men, I am now departing but I will warn you to guard the flock against savage wolves."
[time=1569] At this point his greatest concern was not the pagan culture propagated by the temple Diana but by these false prophets
[time=1576] who would come both from within the flock and attack from the outside and they would bring with them strange doctrines.
[time=1583] And you can see that chapter one verse three.
[time=1586] As I urged you upon my departure from Macedonia remain on at Ephesus in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrine.
[time=1598] Hetero Dedoskelon in the Greek, it's one word Paul coined it himself to talk about this different approach to the Scriptures.
[time=1606] This errant approach to the truth of God. It was diverse, it was different than what he had taught them and it was damning.
[time=1615] And you say where did these false prophets get their strange doctrine and how did they talk people into believing it?
[time=1622] The answer is found at the beginning of verse four nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies.
[time=1629] They themselves had focused, the word pay attention means to focus your mind on something other than the Word of God.
[time=1636] In fact on these myths and endless genealogies and they were able to get these other people to focus on those myths and endless genealogies as well.
[time=1645] And so they were skilled and craftsmen at taking people's attention off the Word of God and onto some myth or genealogy which would develop for them some scheme of interpretation which they would then bring back to the Word of God and they were able then to pervert the truth of God.
[time=1662] It was all man-made concocted stuff, myths and endless genealogies opened the door for us into the whole world and realm of Jewish lore and tradition.
[time=1671] And these men had insatiable appetites to take a look at the Old Testament and see the lists of names and the genealogies and put certain numbers to them and extract certain principles out of that which was in no way the clear or plain teaching of the Word of God.
[time=1686] But they did it nevertheless. And what did all of this produce? Look at verse 4, nor pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which give rise to mere speculation.
[time=1698] All it produced was speculation. All it produced was more questions and it was like getting on a treadmill of sorts and entering you into a cycle that would never stop.
[time=1708] Because once diverting from the truth of God and entertaining these myths and endless genealogies and then you teach about that and all that would do is raise more questions and more speculation and they'd go back to the same source again, more myths and more fables and more genealogies and more legends.
[time=1724] And it was just a vicious circle. Instead, the truth of God was never proclaimed. People never learned the truth about God, about themselves, about Jesus, about salvation and about how to live.
[time=1735] And that brings us to our second point as we continue to review here, heresy in contrast, heresy in contrast, heresy in content we have just looked at verses 3 through 4, heresy in contrast, but the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=1755] You see, what should good Bible teaching produce? What should happen when a man who is faithful to the Word of God steps up and preaches the Word of God and should produce love?
[time=1766] It should produce a community of believers who have been redeemed by the Spirit of God and who look at each other and say, "You are more important to me than I am and I live with you in a manner of self-sacrificing love and I'm committed to you."
[time=1779] And all of that furthers the administration of God. Do you see that at the end of verse 4? Their stuff gives rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God which is by faith.
[time=1793] Administration could have just been translated plan. God has a plan in redemptive history and he's working it out. And when the prophet comes and is faithful to the Word of God and he teaches it as it ought to be taught, he contributes to the administration of God, to the working out of God's redemptive program through space and time.
[time=1811] When men come as false prophets, they detract from it and they leave people into endless questions about speculation which never allows them to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1821] Their false doctrine cannot change a life, transform a heart, teach the truth of Scripture, it cannot purify a heart, it cannot produce a good conscience and it cannot give an un-hypocritical and sincere faith.
[time=1834] And so it is a long and damning process and that is why Paul says, "I urge you," in verse 3, "I urged you upon my departure from Macedonia to remain on that Ephesus."
[time=1845] Apparently, Timothy was somewhat timid. In addition to all his gifts and his godly upbringing and his sincere faith and his good reputation and his concern for the genuine welfare of other people, naturally I guess he was timid and we saw that last week from 2 Timothy.
[time=1859] There was a sense in which he would rather shrink away from a battle than charge it. And so Paul writes to strengthen his hand, and this by the way is a very difficult situation because these false prophets are skilled, they are craftsmen at their trade,
[time=1873] they are knowledgeable and could quite possibly even be older than he is and may have even found their way into leadership in the church at Ephesus.
[time=1882] I believe that may be true because of the inordinate emphasis upon godly leadership in the book of 1 Timothy. Over and over, Timothy is talking about elders and deacons and what leaders are supposed to look like.
[time=1893] And it leaves you with the impression that these certain men, these false prophets have made their way into the church and all the way into leadership, and now with age and wisdom and maturity over Timothy and even a position to go with it, he's got to confront them.
[time=1908] And Paul says, "Don't leave. Remain. You must stay. There is too much at stake." So it's a very careful discussion of heresy, of false doctrine. And it begins as I have said in verses 3 and 4, explaining heresy in content.
[time=1924] What is it? It's strange doctrine. How does it work? Paying attention to man-made concoctions about the scriptures. What does it add up to? Nothing mere speculation.
[time=1933] Heresy in contrast. What should it produce? Well, it should further the administration of God, the goal of which is love from a pure heart, a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=1943] So that by way of review. This morning, we embark on this last section in this passage, verses 6 through 11, and we understand the heresy in case and point. What actually was being taught?
[time=1957] Well, it isn't completely and explicitly stated, but we find by studying the verses, it seems rather clear. Look at verse 7.
[time=1965] These men are wanting to be teachers of the law, verse 8. But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.
[time=1976] And then verse 9, which I think is the greatest clue to what they were doing, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious.
[time=1989] It seems obvious that these men were teaching false and strange doctrines about the law of God, the Old Testament, possibly even the Ten Commandments. They were perverting it.
[time=1999] And this is what they were doing. They were teaching it unlawfully. In other words, they were teaching it the opposite of what it should have been done.
[time=2006] Verse 9, realizing the fact that the law is not made for a righteous man. They were proposing the idea that if you would study the law of God and keep the law of God, it would make you righteous.
[time=2020] If you want to become righteous, study the law and keep the law, and you'll be acceptable to God. They were communicating that if you would like to know what God expects of you, then here is our teaching of the law of the Old Testament.
[time=2033] And if you will be careful to observe what is in it, then you will find acceptance with God. And it couldn't have been further from the truth.
[time=2041] I love the question that was developed in EE by Dr. James Kennedy down in Florida out of his own frustrations in trying to evangelize and clarify the essence of the gospel. Many of you have heard of it. Some of you may be new to this morning.
[time=2054] The question goes something like this. If you were to die today, and if you were to stand before God, and he were to ask you why should I let you into my kingdom, what would you say?
[time=2068] It's a tremendously helpful question because it strikes right at the heart of our understanding of how we are acceptable to God. These men were saying we are acceptable to God through the law, through keeping the law.
[time=2080] You might even take a minute to answer that question in your own mind. If you were to die today, and you were to stand before God, and by the way, all of us will one day die, short of the rapture, and all of us will stand before God. Every man on the earth will stand before God.
[time=2095] And he will basically ask that question. Why? Why should I let you into my kingdom?
[time=2100] I'm amazed when I ask that question of people how often I get the answer. Well, I'm basically a good person. I mean, I'm basically okay. I'm not perfect, certainly not, but I've never murdered anyone, and I've never beat my wife and my children, and I pay most of my taxes, and I'm basically a nice guy.
[time=2119] And above and beyond that, there's sometimes a religious background involved, and well, I attended a church since I was a young boy, and I've even joined that church at one point or another, and I even had a Bible, and I helped into one of the children's ministries, and they go on with their list of things.
[time=2134] And I'm not never, I never do take exception to what they say about themselves. That's not even the point. They may have been all those things and done all those things. The main point of the fact is this, that we cannot earn salvation.
[time=2145] We cannot keep the law and somehow find merit with God. It's almost as if they envision some type of scale that God will put all their bad deeds on one side and all their good deeds on the other, and what they're hoping at that day when God says, "Why should I let you into my heaven is that the good deeds will outweigh the bad deeds?"
[time=2163] And it'll be like a comparative advantage, and compared to everybody else, you're really okay. Now see, these people, the scale was too much on the downside. Their bad deeds didn't outweigh their good deeds, so they go to hell, but you're with this other group of people, and basically you were a good person.
[time=2179] That is in essence what they were communicating in this heresy. I'll not forget the time somebody explained to me that if I were to sin only three times a day, and he really pushed me on this, he said, "Now don't just think about stealing and overt acts of sin. Think about your thought life and think about your motives. Anything less than love would be defined as sin.
[time=2199] If I were to sin only three times a day, that'd be a thousand offenses a year. I'm 32 years old. That's 32,000 sins. 32,000 offenses if I only blow it three times a day."
[time=2214] Now you tell me what kind of a judge it is that when you come into his courtroom and you've got 32,000 offenses on your record, and he says, "Well, you've only got 32. He's got 60. You're okay. You're not okay.
[time=2227] It doesn't work. Who would want a judge like that?" Nobody would, and that's not how God is. God has an absolute holy righteous standard, and you either meet it or you don't, and to meet it, it's absolute perfection from day one until the day of your death, and it's impossible to meet no one has.
[time=2246] A little bit like, you know, I'm California. We have this island off the coast called Catalina. It's a beautiful island. My folks took my wife and I there when we finally graduated from seminary as kind of a celebration that I was now out of purgatory and could live again. You understand?
[time=2262] We had a tremendous time. Two days there, just great celebration. Well, you can see this island from California. You look out the trusty ocean. You see this beautiful island out there. It's a couple miles away, and if you take a boat, it's a couple of hours ride, and it's absolutely preponderous to think that you could jump there.
[time=2278] But that is really what people try to do with salvation. They say, "Look, I'm going to jump to Catalina, and I'm going to know that I did good in comparison to how well you jumped." And so, for example, if my dear mother would stand at the shore of the waters and try to jump to Catalina, what would you give her? Two feet, do you think she'd get off? Maybe three feet?
[time=2297] Now, careful, she watches these tapes, all right, so you got it. So she gets out there two to three feet. I come along. I'm out there six feet, maybe. And I've clearly out-jumped the woman. I'm the winner here.
[time=2310] And then one of these great athletic Olympic athletes comes along and jumps maybe 30 feet. Well, he wins. Problem. None of us made it. None of us even got close to the objective or the goal in Catalina.
[time=2326] The same thing would be spoken of the Grand Canyon. We all three stand on the edge of the Grand Canyon and say, "Okay, here we go." Mom jumps first. Bye. Love you. Have a nice trip.
[time=2341] I jump next. Bye. See you at the bottom. And then this great athlete takes a running start and you walk way out there. I mean, he went way past us. But now he's on his way down because he didn't make it either.
[time=2356] You see, it's preposterous. Yeah, you may do better than somebody else, but you didn't get close to how far you had to get. Absolute total perfection.
[time=2367] These guys were walking around mutilating the law of God, dropping the standard, changing the truth and saying, "Look, if you want to reach the standard, if you want to get to the other side, what you need to do is keep the law and you can earn righteousness with God."
[time=2382] It was a damning heresy. You say, "Well, then what's the law for? If the law isn't so that we know what God expects so we can keep it and earn salvation, then why did God give the law?"
[time=2394] Well, if you have your Bible, turn over to Galatians Chapter 3 and you'll see exactly why God gave the law.
[time=2400] He had a very good reason to give us the law.
[time=2405] Galatians Chapter 3, verses 22 and following, says this, "The scripture, the law, has shut up all men under sin. That's why God gave the law so that all of us could compare our lives against the true and righteous standard and say, "Man, I don't make it.
[time=2422] I'm not even near Catalina. I didn't even get close to the other side of the Grand Canyon."
[time=2429] Verse 22, again, "The scripture has shut up all men under sin that the promise by faith in Christ Jesus might be given to those who believe."
[time=2438] Verse 23, "But before faith came we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed."
[time=2447] Verse 24, now here it is, "Therefore the law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by faith."
[time=2463] The idea of being justified is to be right with God, to declare righteous, to say, "You're righteous. You can come into my heaven, to make it in your leap to Catalina or your leap across the cavern."
[time=2474] That's what it means to be justified. Well, how does that happen? The law of God starts.
[time=2478] It tells us as we look at the law of God that I am an absolute utter failure.
[time=2482] I can get six feet off the coastline and I've got to get two miles. There's no possible way I'm going to earn righteousness or justification with God.
[time=2491] And that is my tutor. That is my instructor. When I really come to that reality in my life and I know that I can't earn my salvation, no matter how nice I might have been, no matter how many Bibles I might have owned, no matter how many churches I might have joined,
[time=2503] I simply can't earn salvation. Then it works as my tutor to the person of Jesus Christ. It's like it's introducing me to Jesus.
[time=2511] It's saying here, "Now, this is the one who has died for you. This is the one who has paid the price for your sin, and you receive Him." See it there in verse 24 by faith.
[time=2521] By faith. Jesus has died my death. I believe that I apprehend that in faith. I accept Him into my life. And I receive the forgiveness of my sins that comes through His dying for my sin.
[time=2534] That is why God gave the law. And these men are not teaching that. These men are teaching it differently, strangely. A perverted doctrine.
[time=2544] Now, if you would come back with me to 1 Timothy. You see, the law by itself is not good news. If all we had was the law, it would not be good.
[time=2556] It's because the law is wrapped up with the gospel that the law becomes good, verse 8, chapter 1. But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.
[time=2567] In other words, if you use the law to be a tutor to people's sinfulness, not so they can earn their salvation, but embrace Christ through faith they can be justified. And because of that, the law is good. Any other use of the law is bad.
[time=2582] So there is basically the heresy in case in point. But I want to develop for you, as Paul does a little bit more about these false prophets. Look at verses 6 and 7.
[time=2594] These men have strayed or are straying from these things, having turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
[time=2612] This is an amazing thing. These men are driven to the position of being a teacher. You see in verse 7, they are wanting to be teachers.
[time=2622] Nama, Dedaskalas, and the Greek, these teachers of the law, it's one word and it's a very strong term and it's a prestigious term and they're borrowing it from Judaism. In fact, Paul's mentor, the man who discipled Paul the wrong way in Judaism, a man by the name of Gamaliel, he was a law teacher.
[time=2640] And with it came all kinds of prestige and recognition and they sought it. They wanted it more than anything else in the world. Was the prominence of the rabbinic office. Jesus scorched them for such a desire.
[time=2652] He said in Matthew 23, "You are men who broaden your flak trees and lengthen the tassels on your garments. That was their religious garb and they kept getting it bigger and more flashy because they wanted more approval of men.
[time=2664] You are seeking the place of honor at banquets. You want the chief seats in the synagogues. You want the respectful greeting in the marketplace. Oh, rabbi.
[time=2674] These men didn't want the earnest pursuit of the knowledge of God through the scriptures so like Timothy they could be concerned for the welfare of others and share the fruit of their labor that these people might increase in love.
[time=2685] That was not their motive. What they wanted was a position of prominence. They wanted to be law teachers.
[time=2691] And their desire for it was so intense that verse 6 says they stray from these things, namely the true goal of our instruction.
[time=2700] And turn aside the fruitless destruction, two powerful words, stray meaning that they have swerved from the true goal. In fact, they're no longer even trying to hit the true goal of verse 5.
[time=2711] And they don't care. They're so caught up in their desire to be teachers that they then wrench the Word of God.
[time=2718] Having turned aside to fruitless discussion, it's a Greek word that means twist and when that same word is used in the medical field of its day, it would mean to dislocate.
[time=2728] They are willing to wrench the scriptures so hard to get what they want out of their life that they literally dislocate the truth of God and turn the law which should be a tutor to Christ for justification through faith into a means of a self-works orientation for righteousness.
[time=2745] No regard whatsoever for the Word of God, wrenching it as you will out of joint.
[time=2753] And notice then, verse 7, that they don't even understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
[time=2762] These men are in the constant state of not knowing what they're talking about.
[time=2767] These men are in the constant state of not knowing what they're talking about, but they do it as if they do.
[time=2774] They make confident assertions and you say, well, wait a minute, these are bright men and that's true and these are learned men, many of them, and they have studied the Old Testament.
[time=2783] Why is it fair to say that they don't understand what they're talking about? And here's the point.
[time=2789] These men have never been crushed by the law. The law of God has never been used in their life to humble them and to bring a contrition of heart whereby they cry out and repentance and proclaim their own sinfulness and embrace the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2804] To them, the law had never had its proper and intended effect in their life and as such, they know a lot about the law, but they know nothing about the law because it's never had its impact on their life.
[time=2815] They're unregenerate men and they've never been humbled and they have always viewed the law through their own sick perspective, which is I can keep it somehow or change it enough that I think I can keep it and earn salvation and self-righteousness.
[time=2826] It's the absolute inverse of what I was intended to do and as a result, they know nothing. They know nothing about the law.
[time=2834] Tons of data, they know nothing. It's like Nicodemus. Do you remember Jesus and Nicodemus?
[time=2840] Nicodemus came to him late at night. He was a famous teacher of the law. He was a ruler of the Jews.
[time=2847] He said to Jesus at night, "Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher and they enter into this big long discussion about what it means to be born again."
[time=2855] And he says, "What must I do to inherit the kingdom of God?" In other words, Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, a famous teacher in the land, a brilliant man who knew the Old Testament like his backhand had probably major sections of it memorized in its original language, which of course would have been his original language.
[time=2874] But he came saying, "Now, how does this work? What does this add up to? How do I really get into the presence of God?"
[time=2882] And Jesus explains to him the dynamics of being born again, which the Nicodemus would have meant starting all over and giving up his entire life of a works righteousness orientation and becoming like a little baby and embracing Jesus Christ in faith.
[time=2894] And Nicodemus just can't understand it. He comes to the place in the conversation where Nicodemus answered and said to him, "How can these things be?"
[time=2903] In other words, it's right over his head and he's learning this from none other than the perfect teacher himself, Jesus Christ.
[time=2909] And Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things?"
[time=2919] Absolutely confrontive statement by the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2923] "You are the teacher of teachers, Nicodemus. You are the ruler of the Jews. You have dedicated your entire life to the study of the law.
[time=2931] It would be comparable to one of you and our midst who would have studied to the ultimate degree, medicine or engineering or some complicated discipline and you devoted your entire life to your study of it.
[time=2942] And finally, you found out in the end that you knew nothing about it because you had misunderstood the whole thing from the beginning.
[time=2952] The law of God is not given so that we can try to keep it and earn righteousness.
[time=2958] The law of God is given as the righteous, holy, pure standard of God to confront us in our sinfulness and to break our hearts so that we fall before Him in abject poverty and cry out for salvation."
[time=2973] These men knew nothing of it and therefore everything they said about the law added up to nothing, futility and speculations and they knew nothing about what they spoke.
[time=2984] Now just quickly as we close and I'm going to be editing here as we go our introduction of BBL has taken a little bit of time but let me keep moving.
[time=2994] Look at verse 9 and following as he comes back now to the law. He's going to say what the law is supposed to be used for and it brings an interesting twist to it.
[time=3004] Verse 9 realizing the fact that the law is not for a righteous man but for those who are now these three cuplets, lawless and rebellious, ungodly and sinners, unholy and profane.
[time=3017] And I don't have time to develop this for you but it seems as if he is taking his cues here in this vise list from the Ten Commandments.
[time=3026] And the reason, excuse me I say that, is because the first four commandments in Exodus 20 relate to our relationship to God and he kind of describes them in these cuplets, lawless and rebellious, ungodly and sinful, unholy and profane.
[time=3041] And then he moves here now watch for those who kill their fathers or mothers.
[time=3046] Well you remember the fifth commandment is that you should honor your father and mother.
[time=3052] Honor your father and mother. In fact Exodus 21 says that if you even strike your mother or father you're worthy of death.
[time=3060] So he takes what would be the fifth commandment and pushes it all the way to its most vile violation that you should actually kill your father and your mother.
[time=3070] The sixth commandment is that you should not kill and you see it there even for murderers.
[time=3076] And then at the beginning of verse 10 the next commandment is that you should not commit adultery.
[time=3081] And he's talking about immoral men and homosexuals and here again he takes what should be the righteous holy pure standard that you don't commit adultery.
[time=3090] In other words it's one man, one woman in the bonds of marriage for life.
[time=3094] And he takes it to immoral men but then he pushes it all the way out to homosexuals which is one Greek compound word meaning males in the marriage bed.
[time=3104] He's saying the standard is purity and righteousness and holy no adultery even between a man and a woman outside of marriage it's one man one woman in the marriage forever.
[time=3115] But its worst violation would be two males in the marriage bed.
[time=3120] So he seems to highlight the worst possible violation of the commandment.
[time=3125] Notice again in verse 10 immoral men and homosexuals and then kidnappers.
[time=3129] Well the seventh commandment or excuse me the eighth commandment is thou shalt not steal.
[time=3134] And these people aren't stealing material things these people are stealing people.
[time=3140] It means to catch somebody by the heel to steal a human being to kidnap.
[time=3144] And in the culture of their day and in the city of Ephesus with the temple Diana it is likely that as often occurs in our own culture these people being stolen were children and they were being stolen for cultic practices inside the temple Diana.
[time=3158] And so he takes basically a mirror image not very tightly but it seems as if his mind is somehow running through the law of the ten commandments and he brings them to their gross violation.
[time=3172] And his point is this.
[time=3174] It's so ridiculous to think that you could get saved by keeping the law and he says look even these kinds of people who have violated the law in its most extreme way find salvation in Jesus Christ through the glorious gospel of God.
[time=3191] Those who are ungodly can be saved those who are sinners can be saved those who have even killed their father and mother can be saved those immoral people all the way to homosexuality can be saved even kidnappers can be saved.
[time=3203] Liars and purgers can be saved and then he adds just a group at all whatever else his contrary to sound teaching.
[time=3210] Anything out there that you can imagine that people have done to violate the ten commandments in the law of God no matter how gross no matter how heinous the glorious message of the gospel is that God can save them through Jesus Christ.
[time=3223] And so he brings a powerfully confronting message to these false prophets in their heresy who would desire to twist and to wrench the word of God to dislocate it as it were to present a works righteousness and in that to promote a damning heresy.
[time=3241] And he says that is the absolute wrong interpretation of the law the law is your tutor to show you your desperate need of Jesus and it doesn't matter how unlawful you've been the grace of God will cover you.
[time=3253] And you say well this is this particular heresy I mean this is this this brand of it what are we to do with all the others that we're confronted with.
[time=3261] What about the Mormons what about the Jehovah's Witness what about the Buddhists what about those of the Islam faith what about all the eastern religion and the new age stuff that is flooding into our society.
[time=3274] What is their heresy and I'll say this to you can simplify all of that stuff into two religions all the religions of the world break down into two religions.
[time=3284] The first is the religion of human achievement and when you strip away all the bells and the whistles and all the disguising things and all the different interpretations of scripture and all the new revelation they want to present it always comes back to that one simple reality that somehow some way you can earn your salvation.
[time=3303] All of them group in that one simple category and then there is only one other religion in the world and it's called the religion of divine accomplishment.
[time=3312] That Jesus Christ has saved people from their sins Jesus Christ has paid the price and there's absolutely nothing we can do to add or subtract from it only to embrace it through faith in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3325] So no matter what country you're in no matter what false prophet you're confronting no matter what group of people who are telling you it's otherwise it always reduces to two very simple realities human achievement versus divine accomplishment.
[time=3340] It's the bottom line on all of that.
[time=3347] So as these men fight and struggle for the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ as these men are fighting a spiritual battle that is being played out in their own life and in the lives of the saints at Ephesus so we too live in a world and as I say these words you can think in your mind of illustrations of ways that
[time=3366] truth is being attacked even in our own day.
[time=3371] And our responsibility is to be a pillar and support of the truth.
[time=3376] That's what Paul says to Timothy to be a pillar and a support of the truth we must stand for the truth of God and together as a family we do that.
