[time=0] In what is known as probably the shortest commencement speech ever given, the aging 80-year-old commencement
[time=17] speaker inched his way out of his chair and with the help of a cane and attendant, struggled
[time=23] his way to the podium. At which time he set only nine words, never give up, never give
[time=32] up, never give up. Having finished his speech, Winston Churchill turned and made his way back
[time=41] to his seat. In the text we studied this morning, it's the Apostle Paul speaking to one of his graduates, the young man Timothy, and he says much the same thing, fight the good fight.
[time=54] Stay with us, won't you?
[time=69] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement, thank you for joining us.
[time=78] Today Pastor Moore will be continuing his series of expositional messages from the book of 1st Timothy. Today's message is entitled, Fight the Good Fight. How often we are tempted
[time=90] to give up when life situation is not to our liking. Winston Churchill speaking from his experience in World War II challenged that graduating class that they should never give up. Paul the Apostle, also speaking from the voice of experience, challenged his student Timothy to never give up. Paul told Timothy that he should fight the good fight.
[time=111] Have your Bible open to the first chapter of 1st Timothy, we'll be looking at verses 18 through 20. Before today's message we will be ministered to by special music from the men singers entitled, All in God's Own Time, and a solo from Susan and Toyarack Stump entitled,
[time=129] With Jesus. As we prepare for our time of worship, let's listen and meditate with the
[time=135] sanctuary choir as they sing, Seekers of Your Heart.
[time=159] Until we let you be, To fill us with Your spirit,
[time=171] Renew us strong with Him.
[time=178] Happy patterns, nothing's gained Without Your Holy presence, our eyes are lit in pain.
[time=201] All we want to know, We are nice to show you.
[time=214] Your heart was broken, Because you saw the need,
[time=242] Because you gave so clearly, Because of help are we.
[time=256] We thank God we hear, On Your own, The needed creations, will we give you love.
[time=279] All we want to know, We live our lives to show you.
[time=384] Lord, we want to know you, May we be seekers of Your heart.
[time=391] The following song that we're going to sing is entitled, The Longer I Serve Him, The Sweeter He Grows, 518, Reminiscence of our grandfathers and grandmothers who love the Lord and our
[time=403] own fathers and mothers who are faithful.
[time=406] May we be able to say that too, That the longer we serve Him, the more we know Him and the sweeter He grows, 518, let's sing it together.
[time=420] Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.
[time=443] The longer I serve Him, The sweeter He grows, The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.
[time=529] Amen, thank you for your good singing.
[time=552] Carol and I have lived in a number of regions of the country and we've been involved in some of nature's very serious storms while living in Marion, Indiana.
[time=560] We experienced a tornado.
[time=562] We moved to Southern California and we were involved in the earthquake and also some fires that made us evacuate our home.
[time=569] Thought we'd move up to the northwest where it was very safe and the Sunday morning that Mount St. Helens erupted.
[time=576] We were right underneath it in a little church ministering that morning.
[time=579] We walked out with this great black cloud above us.
[time=583] It really disrupts your home and there's quite a bit of consternation that's involved.
[time=588] I think of some of the men in the scriptures that the quartets going to sing about such as Noah and Moses and Job and think about their lives and how God turned their lives
[time=598] around and commanded that they do certain things without any future knowledge of really what was going to happen.
[time=605] I'm sure that they had a lot of disruption even in their own family and some questioning and perhaps today.
[time=611] There are some of you that are questioning why God is putting you through some of these circumstances.
[time=616] While I do know this that the scripture says that he is the God of compassion and he's also the God and Father of all comfort.
[time=623] However, he does also tell us that he will do all things, all in his own time, all in
[time=629] God's own time.
[time=641] So I said, "Lord, when will it rain?" My body's all bent with my aches and pains, and everybody calls me a foolish man.
[time=653] It looks like the end of the line, the Lord said, "No, I keep building the ark."
[time=660] One day soon it's going to get real dark, but you'll come through singing like a lark,
[time=667] all in God's own time, all in God's own time, my friend, all in God's own time.
[time=677] Even when you can't seem to get ahead, for always falling behind.
[time=684] Now don't you feel blue, don't you feel so bad when it looks like the end of the line.
[time=692] He's going to work out all of your plans, all in God's own time.
[time=698] Oh, said Lord, what will I do?
[time=701] These root children got me feeling blue, you just won't live like you want them to.
[time=709] It looks like the end of the line, the Lord said, "No, this is your a real good man, just
[time=716] the one leading, just the one leading plan, soon you'll get to the promised land."
[time=723] All in God's own time.
[time=726] Job said, "Lord, I might as well be dead." You took all my children and everything I had, I'm hurting all over and I feel so bad,
[time=737] it looks like the end of the line.
[time=740] I'd said, "Joe, don't you fuss and fret." Listen, boy, I never failed you yet, I'm going to give you back everything that you had.
[time=751] All in God's own time.
[time=754] All in God's own time, my friend.
[time=758] All in God's own time.
[time=761] Even when you can't seem to get ahead, for always falling behind.
[time=768] Now, don't you feel so blue, don't you feel so bad when it looks like the end of the line?
[time=775] He's going to work out all of your plans.
[time=779] All in God's own time.
[time=796] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=798] Thank you for watching today and joining with us as we worship the Lord.
[time=802] Peter Kobe, what a wonderful job in the quartet.
[time=805] Oh, we love that song.
[time=806] I love the theme of it all in God's own time.
[time=809] You know, even in Job's situation and he went through some really trying times with his family, but at the end of it, he just realized how wonderful God was and all the
[time=820] things that he could do for a person, just came to him through the reading and through
[time=826] his circumstances and I love the song and I believe in that, that God puts those circumstances
[time=832] in our lives and in his time, he carries us through and he makes things better for us
[time=838] all in God's own time.
[time=839] [AMEN] We've been seeing some incredible things happening here in our church, all in God's own time, if you will, kind of along that same theme only with respect to the gospel.
[time=850] You know, we've been teaching about the true gospel grace as opposed to a works salvation
[time=856] and in the last two or three weeks, some people have come to know Christ through the members of our church embracing Christ through grace.
[time=864] One of our doctors has been ministering to a patient for nearly three years and in his very office, this patient prayed to receive Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior and
[time=875] another, one of our members of our family was making a call and response.
[time=880] He's a police officer and made a response to a call and out of that came a relationship and weeks later, these people came to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior, even a member of our EE team.
[time=893] They went out to share their faith in Jesus Christ and as it turned out, one of the members of the team realized they didn't know Christ as their personal Lord and Savior and prayed to receive Christ in the car that night and I had a man making a point with me last or
[time=909] three weeks ago now, I guess it was and came in and said, I've been listening to the messages for about three and a half months now and I've never been forgiven.
[time=916] I need to get saved and so he prayed to receive the Lord.
[time=918] It's just amazing how in the Lord's timing, he'll bring people to himself.
[time=923] I think Russes are excellent examples of not only is it important for you to be preaching the true word, but our lay people are listening and then they're responding to God's command to go out
[time=933] and share it with others and that's reaping results and we're glad for those people that are in God's kingdom now and they're looking forward to eternal life with our Savior. That's great.
[time=942] Russ, we have enjoyed the messages and we thank you for your preparation and the insight that you
[time=948] give to us. We look forward to the messages each week. You're going to take a little break on September 29th. We have Dr. Bob Provost. He's a friend of yours. I know you're excited about him coming to our services. Really am and Bob will bring a perspective about Christianity that is
[time=963] very refreshing. It's unique. I think it flows out of his life and the way he lives his life as a
[time=970] contemporary Apostle Paul, if you will, traveling all around the world for the cause of Christ and
[time=976] as hard as full and overflowing with what God is doing, particularly in the Soviet Union.
[time=981] And so we look forward to hearing from him. He'll be with us at our morning services on September 29th
[time=987] at the 915 service and 1050. If you're in this area, I hope you can join us for those very
[time=993] important messages from Dr. Bob Provost who has just recently returned from the Soviet Union.
[time=999] Unless we have some other dates that I want to tell the people about looking ahead in October now, October 13th, Kevin Hartman will be with us. Kevin is a former music director and youth pastor in Indiana. He's going on now to work with Campus Crusade for Christ, but he'll be here singing a special music on Sunday morning and Sunday evening on October 13th. And then on
[time=1020] October 27th, we'll have Bruce Greer. Bruce is a composer and fine pianist. He's written a song
[time=1028] for our choir and he's going to bring some other songs that he's written. Our choir and orchestra and two pianos will have a marvelous day of music on Sunday morning, October 27th, and then he'll be
[time=1039] here at 6 p.m. that evening. So I hope you'll put those dates on your calendar and come and join us
[time=1045] here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. Russ, we also like the people to write in and let us know
[time=1051] that they're watching. I know that sometimes when we're at special events, as we were this last week, it was neat to have people come and say, "We watched the Bible hour and I'm grateful for that." And we're also grateful when they write in. So let's encourage them by giving them a gift offer.
[time=1065] What we're offering has been the same for the last couple of weeks. It's a tape that I,
[time=1071] a message really that I delivered at Grace Community Church a number of months ago, probably 16, 17 months ago in response to my time in the Soviet Union. And on the tape is explained an
[time=1083] incredible opportunity to evangelize and share the gospel with a Russian scientist who worked for
[time=1090] the Soviet Academy of Science in Moscow. And he was anxious to not only use his English skills,
[time=1096] but to learn about the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you're interested in that, we'd love to send it to you by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana. And of course,
[time=1107] the zip code is 46815. The Bible hour, just ask for that tape. We'd be happy to send it to you.
[time=1115] We are encouraged when you write to us. And I'm sure that this tape will be a blessing to the people. So be sure and take that address down once again. Just have a little card that just says,
[time=1126] "We're watching you send us the tape." And once again, I want to give you the address. It's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Well, thank you for
[time=1139] joining us today. We go back to the live portion of our service with some more music. And then the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore. Stay tuned and enjoy the message from God's Word.
[time=1173] Well fed. We search for treasures and try new pleasures, but find more emptiness instead.
[time=1184] So many search for a lifetime, but few will ever acquire what satisfies and gratifies.
[time=1199] The longing heart's design. The joy of every longing heart is Jesus. He's everything he said that he
[time=1218] would be. He's fashioned me to be his own. And now I'll never be alone with Jesus, my Lord.
[time=1244] There's a peace and joy that await us when we're broken and brought along. In the stillness,
[time=1256] we'll be blessed when a greater love we know. You may have searched for a lifetime, but haven't
[time=1267] found the way. Obey his voice and make the choice to follow him today. The joy of every longing heart
[time=1285] is Jesus. He's everything he said that he would be. He fashioned you to be his own. And now you'll
[time=1304] never be alone with Jesus, your Lord. How marvelous God came to us in Bethlehem.
[time=1322] What braids still a mystery, but how he's home to live in me. The hopes and fears of all the years
[time=1334] are headed in. The joy of every longing heart is Jesus. He's everything he said that he would
[time=1352] be. He fashioned us to be his own. And now we'll never be alone with Jesus, our Lord.
[time=1373] With Jesus, our Lord.
[time=1403] Thank you, Suzanne. Beautiful song. Well, if you have your Bibles with you this morning,
[time=1411] I'll invite you to turn to 1 Timothy as we continue in our study of this wonderful book in God's
[time=1418] Word written by the Apostle Paul to his true child in the faith. We come to a portion of Scripture
[time=1426] this morning that is really transitional in the book. It's a major segment really of the things
[time=1433] that Paul is saying. He makes three direct charges to Timothy in this book, and this is the first of those three. You recall that Timothy has been called to remain on at Ephesus and to stand against
[time=1444] false doctrines and false prophets and false teachers, and in that way to guard and shepherd the sheep. And three different times the Apostle Paul in this book speaks directly to Timothy
[time=1456] in encouraging him to do just that. Timothy basically is ready to quit, and so Paul says
[time=1464] you must fight the good fight. And let me take a minute and read these verses and ask you to follow along so we have the text in our minds. "This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son,
[time=1475] in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may fight the
[time=1481] good fight, keeping faith and a good conscience which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck
[time=1487] in regard to their faith. Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have delivered over to Satan
[time=1493] so that they may be taught not to blaspheme." Timothy is ready to quit. Timothy basically is
[time=1500] walking around the streets of Ephesus with his resignation tucked in his pocket, in his jacket.
[time=1507] It's all written out, it's probably signed, all he needs to do is date it and he's out of there.
[time=1511] He's struggling with the calling of God on his life at this point in a tremendous way.
[time=1517] And to help you understand a little bit about that I'll ask you to turn back to Acts, chapter 19, for just a minute I think you'll see just how difficult it really is for Timothy to remain on
[time=1528] at Ephesus. You know we are familiar with the phrase that comes out of campus crusade for Christ, a very helpful evangelistic phrase that goes something like this that God loves you
[time=1539] and has a wonderful plan for your life. And I guess that's true in many ways. It is a wonderful
[time=1545] plan to be redeemed, to be filled with the Spirit of God, to know that you can walk with Jesus Christ.
[time=1549] But in many other ways I think if you were to take a cursory glance or a brief understanding
[time=1555] of the word wonderful, if that is to mean that my life is just as I wanted all my circumstances are working out perfectly, I have no problems, I have no financial difficulties, I have no employment difficulties, I have no marital difficulties. Boy if I could just come to Christ he has this wonderful plan for my life. That obviously is not what the gospel reveals about itself and even in
[time=1576] the life of the Christian. What the Lord said to another man about Paul's life comes to my mind.
[time=1582] He said this right at the moment thereafter the Damascus road experience, "Go for he is a chosen
[time=1589] instrument of mine to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel, for I will show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake." Right there at the point of Paul's
[time=1601] conversion it was already being explained to him that he would suffer for the name of and the cause of Christ and indeed he did. But what makes Timothy's stay at Ephesus so incredibly difficult
[time=1614] is the character and the stature and the significance of Paul's ministry when Paul was at Ephesus and
[time=1620] that is cataloged for us in the 19th chapter of the book of Acts. Look at it. Verse 9, actually
[time=1627] verse 8 Paul had entered the synagogues which was his practice and he continued to speak boldly for three months reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. But when some were becoming
[time=1639] hardened and disobedient speaking evil of the way before the multitude he withdrew from them and took away the disciples, now reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus which was owned by a man of
[time=1650] that same name and it was really a public forum for speaking. It was a place where you could come and make public speeches and he did that for some two years as verse 10 indicates. But look at them, look at the consequences of this man's ministry. Verse 10 says that all who lived in Asia heard
[time=1667] the word of the Lord both Jews and Greeks because of his incredible teaching ministry.
[time=1672] Beyond that verse 11, God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul.
[time=1679] What kind of extraordinary, I mean a miracle is extraordinary enough, but when you start describing it as extraordinary you start piling up your superlatives. Look at verse 12, the handkerchiefs
[time=1690] or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. Paul's ministry was so blessed, so endowed by the power of the Spirit of God that as he stood in the place of Tyrannus day after day his teaching ministry covered all
[time=1706] of Asia. And then his miracle ministry was astounding such that people would bring a handkerchief or
[time=1712] an apron to his body and then take it to their sick beloved one and that sick person would be healed or the demon would be cast out. It was so powerful and so awesome that these verse 13 Jewish
[time=1723] exorcists saw it and wanted to emulate it. So they hung around him and learned that his key phrase was
[time=1729] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ kind of come out or I cast you out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. They're in verse 13. So they found a guy that needed to be exercised. Verse 15, but it didn't
[time=1740] work. The evil spirit answered and said to them, "I recognize Jesus and I know about Paul." So even
[time=1747] this evil spirit knows about Paul but it didn't know it was about Jesus. But who are you guys? And the
[time=1754] man in whom that was the evil spirit leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them so
[time=1760] that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. Powerful demonstration of the might of Satan
[time=1767] through this one man to leap on these Jewish exorcists and strip them naked and send them from the house wounded and needless to say that made headlines. Verse 17, this became known to all both Jews and
[time=1779] Greeks who lived in Ephesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified. This is a huge ministry. Powerful ministry and people were responding and coming to Christ.
[time=1794] Look at verse 18. Many also of those who had believed kept coming confessing and disclosing their practices. Verse 19, "Many of those who practice magic brought their books together and began burning them on the side of all and they counted up the price of them and found it 50,000
[time=1810] pieces of silver." So these people who were coming to Christ through the ministry of Paul were evidencing the fruit of repentance in such a dramatic way that they would go back into their homes and grab the books and the special articles of worship that they had had from the temple Diana bring it right out into the public and ignite it in front of everybody. Tremendous volume of stuff,
[time=1829] 50,000 pieces. Verse 20, "So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing." Now folks,
[time=1839] that is a tough act to follow. All Timothy has now and if you'll go back to Timothy with me,
[time=1848] all Timothy has are these very few words and verse 3, "Remain on at Ephesus." Stay there.
[time=1855] Don't go anywhere. Continue to minister at Ephesus. The fact is though that this fascinating
[time=1864] spellbinding master teacher in the Apostle Paul had already taught him all the new stuff.
[time=1872] Just imagine you're hearing truth from the Apostle Paul for the very first time for three years
[time=1880] running. Where does he get his information from a commentary? No, there were none.
[time=1883] From a Bible, no, it wasn't in existence. He would speak to them out of the revelations
[time=1889] of the mystery of the New Testament church which God had given him in the Arabian desert.
[time=1894] And you're the audience and you learn about Jesus and you learn about the resurrection and
[time=1900] you learn about the crucifixion and the spiritual meaning behind it. And you learn about the Spirit of God and how you can be indwelt and baptized and sealed with the Spirit of God. And you learn about your spiritual resources and the love of God. And the New Testament begins to unfold in front of you as a man speaks it to you out of his own revelation from Jesus Christ.
[time=1917] Fascinating experience. You would never have heard anything he had to say before. It's always new.
[time=1923] It's always electrifying in the exhilaration and the joy of discovering truth for the very first
[time=1929] time. Ephesus was being turned upside down by the ministry of Paul and his preaching and his teaching and it was a buzz that rippled all the way through it. But that had all been done.
[time=1940] All that stuff had been taught. There was no new truth for Timothy to teach just to review what
[time=1947] had already been taught. In fact, so basic a truth as the gospel itself which was under attack.
[time=1954] Not only had the new truth been taught but the master teacher himself had left. Paul had moved on by the ministry of the Spirit led there to another town, another city, another place.
[time=1963] And when he left he took with him his incredible charisma and personality and stature as an
[time=1971] apostle of Jesus Christ. He took with him his enormous teaching gift. He took with him his miracles
[time=1981] and all that God was doing through him and now they just had Timothy, plain ordinary Timothy. The place was a ghost town in comparison to its previous days
[time=1995] when Paul had ministered there. And Timothy's job is now not to perform miracles and not to
[time=2001] declare new and fascinating truth. Instead he must confront false prophets. Great ministry.
[time=2008] Hymenaeus and Alexander as you see them named in verse 20. The very idea of remaining at
[time=2014] Ephesus at this point sounds lonely to Timothy. It's a hard venture. And I'm sure that as he walked
[time=2021] the streets of Ephesus he would see places where Paul had ministered. He would walk by street corners. He would walk by buildings. He would see homes. He would see streams and rivers and he would be reminded constantly of the ministry of his mentor and how far more significantly
[time=2039] gifted Paul was than Timothy was. And he would long for the old days. He would long for the days
[time=2046] when Paul was here and we were turning the city upside down and every day was a new and exciting venture. Instead of having all that he just had long hard days of comparatively uneventful fruit.
[time=2061] Defending the gospel many times unsatisfying long hard days of labor. And it produced significant
[time=2068] questions in his mind and you can see them alluded to in this book and we'll track them. There are basically three of them and they each come out of these exhortations which Paul brings to Timothy, the first verse 18. This command I entrust to you Timothy my son in accordance with the prophecies
[time=2085] previously made concerning you that by them you may fight the good fight. Timothy is questioning
[time=2093] his calling. Timothy is wondering if he's really supposed to be a pastor at all. The prophecies
[time=2102] made mention of there and we'll look at those in detail in time to come are the prophecies made by those with the gift of prophecy in the New Testament era who declared him a servant of God and a minister. And eventually that was recognized by the church itself as they laid hands on him and ordained him into the ministry. But right now Timothy's wondering if that wasn't somehow a mistake.
[time=2122] What is God doing with my life? What is this wonderful plan for my life? Where are you taking me?
[time=2128] If you'll go to chapter four for a minute you'll see another major question he has in his mind.
[time=2134] Verse 14.
[time=2143] Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you which was bestowed upon you through
[time=2149] prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery. Do not neglect the spiritual
[time=2155] gift within you. It appears that Timothy is wondering do I even have enough gifts to perform
[time=2163] this ministry? Am I outclassed? Am I in over my head? Is there too much here for me to really handle?
[time=2171] Did the Spirit of God call me to a ministry that I am not capable of performing in by virtue of not being given the proper and necessary amount of spiritual gifts?
[time=2181] Romans 12 tells us that to each one has been given a measure of faith and then list the spiritual gifts meaning that to each person God has given a certain amount of spiritual giftedness and Timothy is wondering did I get enough? Or am I playing over my head and out of my league?
[time=2199] The next question that comes up in his mind is found in chapter six.
[time=2203] Look at verse 11. He says but flee flee from these things you men of God and pursue righteousness
[time=2219] and godliness and faith and love and perseverance and gentleness. You say what does this mean?
[time=2227] Well the context is to flee and up there it talks about money, materialism. Verse 10 for the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many of paying. Apparently Timothy under the pressure of trying to handle this ministry which is only a shadow of what it used to be questioning his own calling
[time=2248] into the ministry and then wondering if though he was called is he really out of his own ability to minister is this too much for him with all the discouragement apparently now is considering worldly things to salve the pain that goes on inside of his heart. He apparently is being tempted
[time=2265] to involve himself in things of the world out of the desperation and discouragement he has in his own ministry. This idea is strengthened if you'll turn with me to second Timothy chapter two you'll see again now flee second Timothy chapter two verses 20 and 22 we're here being described a large house
[time=2286] with different kinds of vessels some are gold and silver some are wood and earth and where some for honor and some to dishonor therefore if verse 21 a man cleanses himself from these
[time=2297] things he will be a vessel for honor sanctified useful to the master prepared for every good work and now our little phrase flee verse 22 now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness
[time=2308] faith love and peace and with those who call the lord from a pure heart apparently he was even
[time=2316] being tempted to immorality to sexual temptation this is an amazing thing
[time=2328] I want you to know that I'm encouraged by the presence of first and second Timothy in the New
[time=2334] Testament for a number of reasons number one I'm happy to know that a man of Timothy stature
[time=2342] his training you recall he was raised on the sacred scriptures he made a profound profession of faith and was truly born again you remember he had a great reputation among his brethren at Listra and Derby you recall that he is the personal disciple of Paul himself
[time=2358] and now he is at his greatest hour of ministry and he's struggling profoundly
[time=2364] what in the world has God called me to here am I enough to fulfill the task and under the pressure
[time=2375] I find myself and my heart wandering from the things of God being tempted to the things of the world
[time=2382] I like to think that men of Paul's stature and men of Timothy's stature and spiritual leadership and the church of God today can talk at that kind of a meaningful level you can almost see Timothy getting out his portable phone there as he walks through the
[time=2397] streets of Ephesus and yet he had another very discouraging event as happened and he picks up the phone and says Paul man I'm really struggling it's so different than it was when you were here
[time=2410] life is so much harder this ministry is not going at all like it used to could you tell me again about my calling am I really supposed to be a pastor
[time=2421] and Paul if you can convince me on that one then could you tell me why I don't seem to have
[time=2427] enough spiritual gifts to carry this thing off and those may have been easier discussions but
[time=2433] then I'm I'm hoping and thinking and believing that Timothy had the guts to say and by the way Paul under all this pressure I'm cracking and I can feel my heart wandering from God and I can find within me a propensity for the things of the world that's my heart good and it should yours one of the greatest tragedies that could ever be brought
[time=2459] upon the church a lie that I would think coming straight from Satan himself is that your spiritual
[time=2466] leaders don't struggle you don't know why because if your spiritual leaders don't struggle then there's
[time=2473] really no room for you to struggle I mean if you're going to be growing and if you're going to be living your Christian life the way you're supposed to and that begins to put an enormous amount of pressure on everybody not to show any weakness not to show any vulnerability not to show any sense of man I don't know if I'm making it and then comes the real tragedy in all of this then we
[time=2493] take our struggles and we tuck them inside of our hearts and we struggle in absolute isolation from one another and Satan's got half the battle the peer at one puret and describe Satan this way Satan is a pirate who looks for a vessel
[time=2510] without a fleet Satan is a pirate who roams the seas if you will looking for a ship that has been
[time=2518] separated from its fleet so that he can come and swoop down upon it and close it off in isolation
[time=2524] and finish off the job the whole idea of authentic Christianity the phrase has almost been worn
[time=2533] out and it's trivialized but I still believe in it that we could have a community of believers
[time=2540] that is free to struggle honestly and openly with each other and in that not be isolated
[time=2547] and have to try to fight the battle on our own I don't know what you're going through today I
[time=2553] don't know what is happening in your life I know and have talked with some of you about some things
[time=2561] some of you have lost your jobs and for the most part I'm so proud of the way I hear you struggling through but I believe that when you lose your job and you're without it for a long time
[time=2574] these same three questions can come up in your mind one what in the world is God doing with my life
[time=2580] I thought I had a calling maybe not into the ministry but I thought I had a vocation I thought
[time=2586] I had a way of life and it it seemed like God was leading me there and now it's falling apart
[time=2594] God are you there who are you where are you what are you doing with me the second question comes right on its heels am I adequate am I sufficient is there enough of me
[time=2606] to handle the stress and the pressure of this life and the third issue comes quickly on the
[time=2612] heels of that isn't there some relief around here somewhere and with it the temptation to be drawn
[time=2619] into the things of the world maybe you haven't lost your job you've lost your love you're still married to him or her but you've lost your love the spark is gone and you think back oh my goodness
[time=2630] how did I end up in this situation how did we go wrong I thought God led us together and now I
[time=2637] look at the quality of our relationship I look at what really is going on and I I confused with me because there's really nothing here worth staying for I have been carrying around my
[time=2648] resignation papers for weeks and months just looking for the the guts to date it and submit it as a
[time=2655] divorce the same questions come God what are you doing my life I thought you had a plan I thought
[time=2666] you were moving me somewhere behind that comes the question am I enough am I adequate can I make it
[time=2673] is it my fault is there just not enough of me and with that then the temptation to compromise
[time=2681] to skate to flee not to flee youthful us but to flee the trial itself some have lost their health
[time=2689] and the same three questions some of you haven't lost your job your love your health you're just staying in the same thing over and over and over of you I think of some of you moms who continue to pour yourself out and give your life away to your family and whatever you straighten
[time=2704] up somehow ends up messy again you straighten it up and it's messy again and you straighten it up and it's messy again and there are a few people saying thank you and meaning it there are a few people coming alongside to help with the enormous task of leading and actually running the home as
[time=2719] a proverbs 31 woman might and you're saying is this really what life is about is this what it all
[time=2725] adds up to is this the sum total of God's wonderful plan for my life then the questions come God where are you am I enough
[time=2736] I liken it to the mister wizard experiences of life yeah how many have ever saw the cartoon mister
[time=2743] wizard I used to watch it old man he was a turtle this little turtle I can't really remember it
[time=2750] clearly but it stays with me this phrase he used to cry out mister wizard he'd go to mister wizard
[time=2757] and he'd say mister wizard I want to be a fireman and mister wizard would make him a fireman first he'd caution him and say you may not be ready to be but I want to be a fireman so he'd make him a fireman and he'd be so excited about his fire boots and his fire jacket and his fire truck and his firehouse and it was great this is who I am this is what I am this is where I belong and then there'd be a fire and he'd go on the fire and he wouldn't know what he's doing and he'd
[time=2779] get in the middle of it and he'd be about ready to get burnt up and he'd say mister wizard and
[time=2785] mister wizard would save him and bring him back and he was supposed to learn his lesson but every episode he wanted to be somebody else somebody other than he was something that he really couldn't be there feel like that inside mister mister wizard help me help me get me out of this I'm
[time=2805] not enough this certainly can't be your plan for my life well timothy is having a mister wizard experience of the first order he is stuck
[time=2819] with a memory of an incredible ministry of his predecessor and now his task is to remain on
[time=2825] at Ephesus and confront false prophets and he has deep and profound questions about his God and
[time=2832] himself and life let me direct your attention to verse 18 again for just a minute with the
[time=2841] prophecies previously made concerning you that by them you may fight the good fight
[time=2847] fight the good fight and I'm happy to tell you that the word fight there does not describe a brief
[time=2853] skirmish or a temporary battle but rather a strategic military campaign what paul is calling
[time=2861] timothy to is a long drawn out military campaign in other words by his very language in this text
[time=2871] remain on fight the good fight the campaign keep the faith for a long time he is describing for
[time=2879] timothy that what he has really isn't all that unusual what he has in his life really isn't
[time=2886] all that extraordinary paul himself as we have seen in some of our evening messages out of second
[time=2892] krentians chapters four and five struggled immensely with what god was doing in his life and how hard
[time=2898] it was and how often he wished it were different timothy only thinks the grass is greener on the
[time=2904] other side timothy only thinks that if he could just get another assignment in another city with another group of people in a slightly different mission then everything would be fine paul says fight the good fight make a strong laborious military campaign lasting for the cause of christ
[time=2928] a gal used to work for me back in california as a secretary she worked for me for a couple of years and i so admired her relationship with her husband she was a lady who had been
[time=2939] many times confronted with difficulty in her life with some of her kids and sickness and
[time=2946] other things she was no novice about 55 years of age and yet through it all there was a luster
[time=2954] and an excitement and a splendor in her relationship with her husband and she would come back from
[time=2960] the weekend experiences and i'd sit there and listen with envy as she described all the things that they had done throughout the weekend whether it was playing tennis together or golfing or biking
[time=2971] or whatever they did and there was always just this just this glow in her eyes and in her face of how wonderful the whole thing had been and eventually we got the place where we could give her friday off so that she could extend those weekends into three-day weekends and really it was just the joy of her life she and her husband doing all the things that you would hope and dream and imagine to do then one day he died suddenly without any forewarning the man just had a heart attack and
[time=3000] died and they were just on the brink of being able to retire and then do that stuff all the time
[time=3007] when he died she wasn't working for me but i went by and saw her and spent some time with her and really found myself without words to describe the hurt that i knew she must be feeling that i felt for her to have you know live the difficult and hard life and i have now this one tangible reality
[time=3023] that seemed to mean so much to her snatched from her right when it was coming to fullest fruition
[time=3031] we cried together pray together sometime later she stopped by my office to talk to me
[time=3037] and she explained to me how she was coping and i was proud of her and she left me with a little
[time=3045] poem that had been especially meaningful to her it goes like this for a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin real life
[time=3059] but there was always some obstacle in the way something to be got through first some unfinished business time still to be served a debt to be paid then life would begin
[time=3073] it lasted dawned on me that these obstacles were my life
[time=3080] these obstacles they are my life
[time=3088] you know you and i are fallen people as even though we're redeemed we still are fallen people living in a fallen world and our life is in many ways nowhere near what we would hope it would be
[time=3100] i want to encourage you this morning with these two thoughts the level of your spirituality will not minimize the trauma of your life
[time=3114] the apostle paul knew that and timothy knew that these were great and awesome men of god
[time=3120] who at a strategic point in the history of the church were buckling at the knees looking for
[time=3126] another assignment questioning the call of god questioning their giftedness to perform in that
[time=3132] call of god and being tempted to the seducing realities of the world
[time=3138] i hope that encourages you secondly i want you to know that if you try to fight your battle by yourself in isolation you
[time=3146] have given satan half the victory there must be people in your life with whom you can sit and
[time=3153] talk and cry with and openly talk about your life and show them how you're really feeling because there you will find the one and others of the new testament beginning new testament beginning to take place in your life throw away this notion that you are self-sufficient
[time=3169] you jesus and the bible are enough that's a foreign thought it's you jesus the bible and the brethren over and over and over and over
[time=3182] again in the new testament and you must be willing to be vulnerable enough to let the brethren in
[time=3188] where you are really hurting and where you are really struggling or you try to fight this thing in isolation
[time=3198] one of the shortest commencement addresses ever given
[time=3206] was given by an old and aging man of about 80 years old it was time for him to speak
[time=3214] and so he inched his way out of his chair and struggled to find his way to the pulpit with the help of his cane and an attendant and he had nine words for this great commencement address nine you know what they were
[time=3234] don't give up that's three don't give up up six don't give up
[time=3251] that was nine Winston Churchill turned from the podium and found his way back to his seat
[time=3260] the man had learned the lesson through his life had me don't give up let's stand for a closing
[time=3269] word of prayer father we are thankful that you have not left us without some personal insights
[time=3282] into the great spiritual leaders of the past men like the apostle Paul and Timothy sitting down and talking about life and opening up where they really hurt and where they really struggle and what their fears really are and help us lord to be as brave help us to follow in their example father i pray for those who are deeply struggling in our family today i pray that you would encourage
[time=3306] and strengthen them through the power of the spirit of god that you administer to them through the brethren that we would be a loving carrying community of believers that has the time and takes the trouble to listen to one another and to genuinely open our hearts because father there
[time=3322] is a battle to be fought a battle that has been won but nevertheless we must play our part in it
[time=3329] we pray for the grace of god to do just that thank you in Jesus name amen well as is our custom we
[time=3338] want to take a minute at the end of each service and i know we're again a little late some of these announcements that we're making put us off schedule just a bit i'm thankful for your patience but we don't want to rush through a very important time together this morning and that is giving you the opportunity to respond you know i'm so thrilled that what god is doing in our church in the last
[time=3356] three or four weeks some marvelous conversions have occurred through the life of our church
[time=3363] people have come to christ i think of four or five specific situations where folks have come to christ and it's just been overwhelming to see the spirit of god work and to call people to
[time=3374] the grace of god the gospel of jesus christ some of that occurs because folks have sat in the sanctuary
[time=3380] and heard the word of god preached and their heart is pricked the spirit of god has touched them
[time=3386] maybe you're there today maybe you know your life and you know you're not right with christ
