[time=0] I arrived in Moscow just as the coup was beginning and this morning, this morning we want to talk to you about the great things that God is doing in the Soviet Union. Stay with us.
[time=23] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=33] Today we are excited to have as our special guest speaker, Dr. Robert Provost. During the last several weeks, World News has focused on many changes in the Soviet Union,
[time=42] changes that we could not have imagined even a year ago. Though not reported in the news, a significant spiritual awakening is also taking place in the Soviet Union.
[time=52] Our special speaker today is at the forefront of the evangelical thrust into that country. On his most recent trip, he arrived in Russia the evening of the coup.
[time=61] During the tense days before the failure of the coup, he worked with local church leaders as they shared the gospel with the Soviet people and with the soldiers involved in the standoff.
[time=71] Don't miss this very special message about the expansion of the gospel into today's Soviet Union. Before today's message, we will be ministered to by a solo from Kevin Rowe entitled "I am the Vine"
[time=84] and an instrumental medley by Dave and Debbie Johnson, including Haven of Rest and Like a River Glorious.
[time=92] As we prepare for our time of worship, let's join with the sanctuary choir as they sing "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner."
[time=121] "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner." "Lift High the Lord, Jesus King." "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner." "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner."
[time=145] "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner."
[time=154] "Lift High the Praise to His King, Lord He is wonderful, Lord He brings a high, Lord He is our blend.
[time=172] "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner."
[time=191] "Lift High the Praise to His King, Lord He is wonderful, Lord He brings a high.
[time=205] "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner.
[time=222] "Lift High the Lord, Jesus King.
[time=226] "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner.
[time=352] "Lift High the Lord.
[time=355] "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner.
[time=376] "Lift High the Lord.
[time=387] "Lift High the Lord, Our Banner.
[time=397] "Lift High the Lord.
[time=441] [MUSIC - 111 seconds]
[time=557] - Amen.
[time=564] We continue with music now as we are ministered in song by Kevin Rowe.
[time=568] Let's listen to the message that he has for us.
[time=570] (piano music)
[time=579] [MUSIC - 142 seconds]
[time=728] - Thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour Today.
[time=744] We really appreciate it when you tune in and we especially appreciate it.
[time=748] When you send cards and notes to us telling us that you're watching the Bible Hour.
[time=752] Each Wednesday our staff meets together and during that time we have a prayer time and the requests that are received from the Bible Hour.
[time=760] We pray for them, we look them over and we really are concerned about those of you that have needs.
[time=765] We hope that you'll send your needs to us so that we can help you in praying for those needs that God will intercede.
[time=771] This is a special day on the Bible Hour.
[time=773] We're gonna tell you a little bit more about that in a minute but I'd like to tell you about a coming event.
[time=777] On October 27th on Sunday morning, in fact Bruce Greer will be here all day.
[time=783] Bruce is one of our friends from Texas, a marvelous pianist and a ranger.
[time=787] He arranged some music for our choir for our dedication of our new building.
[time=792] And he's written some new music that we'll use with our choir.
[time=795] The orchestra and two pianos will have a marvelous time on Sunday morning and Sunday evening, October 27th.
[time=801] We'll tell you more about that program as the days come and be sure and put it on your calendar and join with us however.
[time=809] Now I mentioned this is a special day.
[time=810] We've been talking about Dr. Bob Provost from Send International coming to us and he's here today.
[time=816] Russell, he's a friend of yours and we're delighted that he's here and introduce him to our friends.
[time=821] - Thank you Peter, we are so thrilled that you're here today Bob, Bob Provost, Dr. Bob Provost with Send International.
[time=827] I don't know, there are so many titles I could give you because of all you mean to me.
[time=832] He is clearly the point man for what God is doing in the Soviet Union and in what we used to call Eastern Europe.
[time=839] But more importantly to that, he's one of the best friends I have in the world.
[time=842] You've discipled me, I've worked for you and we're so glad you've agreed to come and be with us today.
[time=848] - Well, it's a great thrill for me to be here.
[time=850] Russell, it's true that I have love for you as a father for a son and it's just great to be here just to have the time together.
[time=857] And it's great to be here because for many, many years I have admired and respected Blackhawk Baptist Church from a distance from when I went to Grace Seminary many, many years ago.
[time=867] But it's the first time I've ever gotten to come here and actually be here.
[time=870] And so it is a very special day.
[time=871] Thank you for letting me be here.
[time=873] - You're welcome.
[time=874] Now you've just returned from the Soviet Union.
[time=877] - Well I came back, I think it was September 6th from Siberia.
[time=882] - Tell us about that trip, how long was it and what were you doing?
[time=885] - Well this trip was a little more interesting than the previous ones because on the day that I arrived in the Soviet Union, the coup was just beginning.
[time=894] And so it was kind of exciting.
[time=896] But more than that it was a special blessing to be with the church leaders and to be praying with them and to be involved in planning for the future right in the midst of the coup.
[time=908] And then to travel all across Siberia which I hadn't done before.
[time=912] And incidentally there are a lot of big cities in Siberia.
[time=915] Now we think of Siberia just as desolate and there's much of that.
[time=919] But for example tomorrow I'll be going back to the center of Siberia to a city called Krasna Yarsk where a million people live in a beautiful city.
[time=928] Run down but well planned and, but different than you would expect Siberia to be.
[time=934] And there's a great Baptist church there with about 300 people and we're gonna be helping them do evangelism in their city.
[time=942] - That's amazing.
[time=944] - Bob you said that you were there and you're heading again tomorrow.
[time=947] Is that your primary focus then to encourage the pastors and the lay people?
[time=952] Or what are your plans now as you return?
[time=954] - Well our main ministry, Pete overall, is to come alongside the church that has suffered so much.
[time=961] The church in the Soviet Union has paid a great, great price to name the name of Christ.
[time=967] And now they have freedom to reach their country and the whole country is excited about learning about God.
[time=973] Literally the whole Soviet Union.
[time=975] It's hard to find someone who doesn't want to be witness to everyone who wants a Bible.
[time=979] Everyone wants a brochure or a Bible tract.
[time=981] It's just an amazing thing to behold.
[time=983] And, but there's so few Christians.
[time=986] There are only about one out of every 1,000 people.
[time=989] And if they were all missionaries they couldn't do the job, one out of 1,000, you know.
[time=995] And so we've got to do everything we can.
[time=996] And so I travel America every opportunity when I'm home to go to churches as to come to Blackhawk today and to our viewing audience and to say, "Now, who will come and help?" We've got to come alongside this church that has spent much time in prison for naming the name of Christ and has been denied education.
[time=1014] They've been denied career advancement just because they were Christians.
[time=1017] And now God has opened this country in a wonderful way.
[time=1020] They have more freedom than we have here in America to evangelize, much more.
[time=1025] I mean, you can just preach everywhere.
[time=1026] You go in the schools, principles are begging pastors to send people to teach the Bible to all the children in the schools.
[time=1032] And many, many more things like, it's just like a new planet is opened in the advancement opportunity for God's kingdom.
[time=1039] - You're looking for a prayer request that certainly is one that God will raise up Christians that will see the need for this opportunity now in Russia that open door to even go there and help out, to pray and even give financially.
[time=1051] And we'll be looking forward to the message from Dr. Provost in just a few minutes.
[time=1055] This is the last opportunity for you to receive the cassette of Russell Moore going to Russia and his experiences there.
[time=1063] Russ, tell them one more time about this gift offer.
[time=1065] Will you please?
[time=1066] - Well, as you were saying, Dr. Provost, it's amazing how the people of Russia are hungry to know about God.
[time=1071] And I was traveling on an all-night train ride from Kiev to Moscow and was literally approached and then helped over to his table, young Russian scientists who wanted to speak English with me.
[time=1084] But what he really wanted to talk about was God.
[time=1086] And so he spent three to four hours just talking about God and the scriptures and he didn't pray to receive Christ on that particular train ride.
[time=1093] We've corresponded two or three times since then.
[time=1096] But on this tape, a message I delivered at Grace Community Church, I relate the wonder of what God is doing not only in the Soviet Union, but in the heart of that man and how it can encourage us in personal evangelism.
[time=1107] We'd love for you to have that.
[time=1109] - You can receive this tape by simply writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1119] Want to be more informed about what's happening in the Soviet Union right today for this tape?
[time=1124] Give you the address one more time.
[time=1125] It's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1134] We're glad that you joined us, Dr. Provost.
[time=1136] We look forward to your message in just a few minutes.
[time=1139] We go back to the regular program now, listen to some music and then the message from our guest speaker, Dr. Bob Provost.
[time=1173] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=1376] [ Applause ]
[time=1384] [AMEN] Dave and Debbie, I'd like to request that when we get to Heaven, I could reserve a day, an entire day, and you all just play for me, all right?
[time=1393] Just spend the whole day that way.
[time=1395] Your fingers won't get tired because we'll be in Heaven and we'll just spend it that way.
[time=1400] And you all can join in if you like.
[time=1402] Well, I've been looking forward to today for a long time because I have known in my heart the treat that is in store for you, the joy that is mine to share with you a dear and treasured friend and mentor someone who has discipled me, someone who has invested his life in me.
[time=1419] Dr. Bob Provost is with us this morning.
[time=1421] We've enjoyed a tremendous time together.
[time=1423] The men so far, Friday and Saturday, 150 of us went away and the Lord gave us perfect weather and a perfect speaker and perfect music and everything seemed to Joe just so wonderfully.
[time=1434] I even wanted horseshoes, want you to know that.
[time=1437] It's just been great.
[time=1439] My heart is overflowing with the goodness of the Lord and all that he is doing in our midst.
[time=1444] As I've shared with you in previous messages, just as it overflows out of my own heart, Bob Provost is being used in a very significant way in the Kingdom of God.
[time=1454] He is one of the Lord's key pointmen, if you will, in capitalizing for the cause of Christ, what has gone on in this cataclysmic political upheaval in Russia
[time=1467] and what we used to call Eastern Europe.
[time=1469] We would all understand the sovereignty of God, how he orchestrates all of that and opens the door, if you will, for the gospel to be shared in a new and a dynamic way and a fresh way and with freedom they've never had before and leading the parade is Dr. Bob Provost.
[time=1485] He, as I think of him, is almost like a floodgate for what is good and right about evangelical Christianity from the West, being introduced in a very careful and strategic way to Russia and Eastern Europe.
[time=1499] The Lord is using Bob to do that because he is so well networked with, again, all that you and I would think of as healthy and strong and vibrant about Christianity from the West.
[time=1510] And now I guess his tenth visit to the Soviet Union, the Lord has opened just miraculously doors of relationship with key leaders in the Soviet Union.
[time=1520] And so he's able to marry these resources.
[time=1523] He is able to strategically implement men of God and strategy and vision and an approach to the gospel and to the Word of God and to church that they so desperately need and are looking forward to receiving.
[time=1537] It's our great joy this morning to get just a taste of that.
[time=1540] Bob, thank you so much for receiving our invitation to come and now would you welcome Dr. Bob Provost.
[time=1546] I counted a very high privilege to be with you today.
[time=1560] Russell Moore, thank you for those kind words, but I want to clarify and simply say, I am a fellow struggler.
[time=1567] The Lord has given me a job that I can't begin to handle.
[time=1570] And this is the third or fourth job that he's given me that I can't begin to handle.
[time=1575] And so I would begin by asking for your prayers.
[time=1580] I have admired and respected Black Hawk Baptist Church for many, many years.
[time=1586] And my respect of your church began when I was in seminary, not far away, over in Warsaw, at Grace in the '70s.
[time=1592] But I never had a chance to come over here.
[time=1594] I was always involved in a church there, and then finished and went back to the chapel in Akron where it come from, where Rick Hawks had come from before.
[time=1602] And then the Lord began to use the legacy of Rick in the lives of our children,
[time=1608] for Rick had the reputation of having turned a high school back there, Kiowa Falls High School, upside down for Christ, when he was a younger man and our kids were trying to do that, and they heard about Rick and they saw him out and they said, "You've got to teach us how to do what you did." And so he had a great impact on our kids, and I'd known him before that, and since then, and then heard about the marriage of Rick and Kathy and you folks here for a number of years, and how God had blessed.
[time=1632] And then the Lord took us to California, brought Russell more into our lives, and I love him like a son, and what a thrill to be here.
[time=1640] If only Russell and I were here today, it would be a wonderful day.
[time=1644] And the Lord then used Russell in California again in the lives of our children, and he discipled our children through excellent policies and programs at the Masters College in a very personal way, continues to be a great encouragement to our son Todd, who is the youth pastor at the Bible Baptist Fellowship Church, not far from here in Auburn, Indiana.
[time=1663] Well, it's my privilege and my responsibility today.
[time=1667] My calling with Send International is to minister and to try to help the churches
[time=1674] in the Soviet Union and in Central Europe.
[time=1677] My job is to try to come alongside and bring people and resources to those churches that have literally died.
[time=1683] People so many have died and so many have been in prison to keep their church doors open since the Communists take over back in the Soviet Union in 1917.
[time=1692] And so that's all we're trying to do. It's very simple.
[time=1694] We're trying to go and help these churches that now have freedom to preach the gospel, reach their country.
[time=1699] You see, they're not allowed, they weren't allowed to do anything, but hold worship services and have choir practices until just about a year ago.
[time=1707] And now they're trying to organize Sunday schools, they're trying to organize youth programs, they're trying to get discipleship going, they don't know nothing about any of that stuff, and they're saying, "Won't you come and help us?" And they're trying to build new church buildings.
[time=1719] They have very little money, and they do all the work themselves.
[time=1723] You know, they can build a new church building that seats 500 people with six Sunday school rooms and a library and an office, and more, they can build one like that for about $10,000 worth of building materials. The problem is, their salaries are $400 a year for a family or less.
[time=1740] Can you imagine?
[time=1742] Because the communists have just destroyed the Soviet Union, the communists have destroyed Central Europe.
[time=1750] I want to begin here this morning by telling you about one of my first trips
[time=1757] to the country of Romania.
[time=1759] It occurred just after the folks there began to overthrow the communists.
[time=1765] I say that because they haven't completely overthrown them yet.
[time=1768] You may have been watching the news in recent days, and please be in prayer that this would be the end of the communist regime in the nation of Romania that has suffered so much.
[time=1777] The country of Romania and the country of the Soviet Union had the greatest persecution.
[time=1781] The Christians were most severely persecuted in those two countries, and in those two countries, as a result of that persecution, the church is the strongest.
[time=1790] In Romania one evening, I found myself in the midst of a political demonstration.
[time=1799] A young man who I had met on a train, a young Romanian veterinarian who's not yet a Christian, decided to host me there in Bucharest.
[time=1806] I didn't know anyone there and didn't speak a word of the language, and one evening he took me to a political demonstration.
[time=1812] He said, "Wouldn't you like to come?" He said, "The army and the Air Force officers are demonstrating against our new government." Well, I'd never heard of that before, you know, in America.
[time=1822] If there's anybody that's really under authority, it's the military, right?
[time=1825] You haven't heard of our military ever demonstrating.
[time=1828] That was a new thing. I was rather curious about that.
[time=1830] So he took me to this massive demonstration in the central public square.
[time=1834] Thousands. I don't know how many thousands were there.
[time=1838] And he said to me, "Wouldn't you like to interview some of these officers and hear what they have to say?" He said, "I'd be happy to translate for you." I said, "That'd be very interesting. Let's try it." So he began to talk and they had interesting response.
[time=1850] They were kind and gentle men and very impressive.
[time=1853] I kept thinking they seemed like they're Christians, these guys.
[time=1856] And then the crowd, this huge crowd, noting that I was a foreigner, and a foreigner there in Bucharest at that time was a rare, rare kind of a scene, because up until Ceausescu was overthrown, a Romanian citizen had been seen even talking to a foreigner, and he would have been hauled immediately to jail.
[time=1873] There weren't a lot of any contact with foreigners whatsoever.
[time=1876] And so this crowd naturally, so curious about a foreigner, and they could hear I was speaking a different language.
[time=1881] And so they came in around me, and it was like everyone in this church, and many more people, and just kind of squeezed it up around.
[time=1887] And I looked up at this, and I remember the thought I had was, "Boy, if the Lord gives me a crowd like this, I'd better try to say something spiritual." And so with my new pagan friend, I say that word affectionately, not to Christ yet, translating for me, I'm yelling at the top of my voice without any P.A. system, and I said these words very simply.
[time=1907] I just said, "We in America are thankful to God for the wonderful new freedom that He has given to you," because they already had a lot of freedom even then.
[time=1915] And I said, "And we're even sympathetic with why you're gathered here this evening." But I said, "I'm constrained in my heart.
[time=1922] I must tell you that the ultimate answer to all your problems cannot even be found in democracy, not even in democracy, but can only be found in faith in Jesus Christ." And a man way deep straight ahead in the crowd yelled back to me in English.
[time=1939] He said, "Mr. What you said is true." And somebody over here in the crowd yelled out, and they said, "Can you get us Bibles?" They said, "And somebody said, 'Why have you come to our country?' I said, 'I've come to help your churches.' And the next person said, 'Can you get us Bibles all across our country?
[time=1955] We need Bibles. We need the Word of God.'" And five or six people in rapid succession were all yelling out, "Can you get us Bibles?" And do you remember where I said I was?
[time=1965] This was in a political demonstration.
[time=1967] This was not in a denominational conference.
[time=1970] This was not a church meeting.
[time=1972] These were people gathered in the street angry with their government and they were crying out, "Can you get us Bibles?
[time=1978] Can you get us Bibles?" Turn with me to Daniel in chapter two for just a couple of minutes, please.
[time=1984] If you have ever wondered if God really does raise up the authorities,
[time=1997] if God really is the author of all governments,
[time=2003] at the end of this time together, you should never doubt that again.
[time=2007] In the Word of God, here in verse 20 of chapter two, Daniel saying this, "Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him.
[time=2018] And it is He, God, who changes the times and the epochs.
[time=2021] If there has ever been a change in a time, a change in an epoch, we have lived through it." Those of us privileged to be alive in these last 24 months.
[time=2031] He removes kings, Daniel says, and he establishes kings.
[time=2036] Talking here about all kings, all political authorities, and we get the confirmation of that from Romans in chapter 13 in verse one.
[time=2044] Turn over there with me, please.
[time=2047] The Apostle Paul writing him.
[time=2049] In case we don't have it clear that God is the author of all authorities.
[time=2054] He says this, "Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities,
[time=2060] for there is no authority except from God, no authority except from God." But he doesn't stop there in case we didn't get it.
[time=2068] He says this, "And those which exist are established by God." You say even communists, even these terrible communists?
[time=2078] You mean God raised up the communists?
[time=2083] And how in the world could it have changed so quickly?
[time=2086] No one saw it coming, no one.
[time=2089] President Bush has been criticized by the media because he didn't see it coming.
[time=2094] Turn with me to Acts in chapter one for just a minute.
[time=2098] Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in another context, but to be sure the principle applies here, he has this to say.
[time=2107] He says it is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by his own authority.
[time=2113] What is he teaching here?
[time=2115] I believe that he's teaching that when something big is going to happen that God is going to do, we're not going to see it coming, you know, because God's doing it.
[time=2126] And he wants everybody to know that God has done it.
[time=2129] And when you sit next to people on airplanes, ever since this began to occur, I haven't found anything.
[time=2134] Lots of men will tell you that they're agnostics and some will tell you they're atheists, but I haven't even found one of those guys who didn't readily agree that there had to have been a supernatural influence of some kind in this cataclysmic political change that happened in these eight countries in the last two years.
[time=2152] Just utterly amazing.
[time=2154] I have a letter I just received in the last two weeks from a political leader in the country of Albania.
[time=2165] Can you imagine?
[time=2166] If you have known about the country of Albania, it has been airtight closed.
[time=2171] To be a Christian in Albania was to be, well, let me say it another way.
[time=2178] Their constitution required that everyone be an atheist in the country.
[time=2183] No churches, no known believers.
[time=2186] And about a year and a half ago, the Lord led me through the Albanian embassy in Vienna when we didn't have relationship with the Albanian government, so there was no way we could go directly.
[time=2194] So I went to their embassy in Vienna, and the Lord helped me befriend an attégé in their embassy in Vienna.
[time=2202] And I began to send him, he had asked me if I could send him books about American presidents and send them to his home address, and we began to send him books, and the Lord used that to build a relationship.
[time=2212] And about two weeks ago, I received a letter from Tyrana, Albania, from this man, saying I'm now here in a new position in international relations in our government.
[time=2221] I was writing to ask you how I could help you in any way.
[time=2225] You want to come to our country? What you want to do?
[time=2227] Just let me know what you want to do in the country of Albania.
[time=2231] I want to talk to you about how God used the communists here, just for a minute.
[time=2239] Okay?
[time=2240] God raised them up, and did he ever use them? They didn't know it.
[time=2243] They didn't know if they had had any idea that God was using them for his glory and for his good and the long run from an eternal perspective, I don't know what they would have done.
[time=2252] But God used the communists in the Soviet Union to do at least four vital things.
[time=2257] Up until a month ago it was only three things, but I'll tell you about the importance of the coup.
[time=2262] The first thing that the Lord used the communists to do was to purify the church.
[time=2267] A Russian pastor a couple of years ago came out to California, and he was in our church there, and he came to Dr. MacArthur at the end of the service, and he said, "You know, I feel sorry for you." He was just visiting from the Soviet Union, and Dr. MacArthur was sort of taken back, he said, "I feel sorry for you." He said, "I'm so glad I don't have to be a pastor in America that God lets me be a pastor in the Soviet Union."
[time=2291] He said, "Because I only have committed people in my church.
[time=2294] I only have committed people. It costs so much to be a Christian.
[time=2297] I don't have anybody except committed Christians, and the church is in America.
[time=2300] That's a whole different story I hear, and I think it would be real hard to be a pastor in America.
[time=2305] He was thanking the Lord that he could be a pastor in the Soviet Union and endure the persecution, but have a flock that was totally committed to the Lord.
[time=2313] What does it mean to be a Christian in the Soviet Union?
[time=2317] To be a Christian until a year ago meant that you couldn't go to school beyond the 11th grade.
[time=2323] You couldn't get into a university, and if you snuck into a university and it was time to graduate and they found out you were a Christian, even though you had completed all the coursework, they would have denied your graduation.
[time=2333] To be a Christian in the Soviet Union and much of Central York for these last several decades has meant that you could have no career advancement.
[time=2339] You could never have anyone work for you because they didn't want a Christian to be a supervisor and contaminate those subordinates with this Christian mythology, as they called it.
[time=2351] To be a Christian then meant that you could have no economic advancement, that you couldn't have no hope ever of ever owning anything, a house or a car or anything like that, just because you named the name of Christ. Do you think that produced a pure church?
[time=2363] That really produced a pure church.
[time=2366] I don't think there may be in China, to say it another way,
[time=2372] where the persecution has been the greatest, the church is the purest around the world.
[time=2376] That's how God has done that, and he's prepared that church for such a day as this.
[time=2381] The second thing the Lord used the Communists to do was to protect the doctrine.
[time=2386] They never heard of liberal theology until about a year ago.
[time=2390] They never had any cause. They never had any false teachers coming into their country.
[time=2394] Who would go there? Only Christians tried to sneak in there to help.
[time=2398] False teachers wouldn't try to go in.
[time=2400] The Lord used the Communists to protect the doctrine.
[time=2404] We've had people picking away at God's word far too many Christian schools at Christian colleges
[time=2410] and seminaries in America no longer have an adequate view of the authority of Scripture.
[time=2415] I mean, people question whether God really created the universe in six days.
[time=2419] Could that be? These people were saying, "What are you talking about?" They're saying, "It says right here in Genesis chapter 1, "Mornings and evenings, six days." What else could it be? Is he God or isn't he God?
[time=2428] They never heard. They think it's such a crazy idea, you know?
[time=2432] God used the Communists to protect the doctrine.
[time=2435] The third thing the Lord used the Communists to do was to prepare the harvest.
[time=2439] To prepare the greatest harvest that ever could be imagined.
[time=2442] I mean, today there are almost 300 million people in the Soviet Union and it's very, very difficult to find one person.
[time=2449] I mean, you go out and witness all day long every day and I don't know how many days you'll have to go before you find the first person who doesn't want to be witness to.
[time=2457] I mean, everybody wants you to tell them, "God, tell us about God." People are all saying, "Our faith was taken from us. One time our family had a faith, but it was taken from us." And we don't want that to be denied our children.
[time=2468] The non-Christians are calling the churches and saying, "When are you going to start a Sunday school?
[time=2471] We want to send our kids so you can teach them about the Bible." The churches, the few churches that do have Sunday schools, less than 10% so far, they want us to help them do that, less than 10% of Sunday schools and those ones that do many of them, even though they're not educated, they're smart people, and many of them have already started a second track because they realize the kids from non-believing homes that have no understanding whatsoever of the Bible
[time=2496] need to have a remedial program.
[time=2498] People want an unsafe kid from an unsafe family comes to their church, they put them in a special program for them for about a year to bring them up to speed before they can put them in the main Sunday school.
[time=2508] It is utterly amazing.
[time=2511] The Lord used the communists to prepare this harvest.
[time=2514] How did He use the communists to destroy the country?
[time=2517] The communists destroyed all these countries, all eight countries.
[time=2520] Ruined their economies, ruined everything about them.
[time=2523] And they've hidden that from us.
[time=2525] You just walk around in these cities and you get angry with these leaders that have ripped off their people.
[time=2530] It's been like government by mafia.
[time=2532] In the Soviet Union, on the backs of the people, they build an incredible military program, they build an incredible space program and an incredible Olympic athletic program, right?
[time=2542] Because the world could see that.
[time=2544] And these leaders wanted everybody around the world to think they were great, but they wouldn't let them see what it cost in the country.
[time=2550] They destroyed their nation doing it in every way.
[time=2553] And so, now with nations destroyed, nothing to buy.
[time=2557] Even if they have money, now their money is worth less and less all the time.
[time=2560] In March, you could get six rubles for a dollar.
[time=2563] In August, I was offered 50 rubles for a dollar.
[time=2566] Their money is worthless.
[time=2568] Many people have money, but it buys nothing.
[time=2570] But the stores are empty.
[time=2572] The stores are absolutely empty.
[time=2574] There's nothing to buy.
[time=2575] There's no hope.
[time=2576] A young couple gets married.
[time=2578] They have no hope of ever having their own apartment before 10 or 15 years.
[time=2582] There's three generations living in 600 square feet without hope.
[time=2586] The only possibility for the people in the Soviet Union today is that there is a God, and that he cares about them, and that he could help them.
[time=2594] That's the only possibility.
[time=2596] And so, the whole country is saying, "Come and tell us about God." The first thing the Lord used the communists to do is to promote the harvest, prepare the harvest, how, what am I saying?
[time=2604] Well, you see the coup that occurred, needed to occur.
[time=2607] Because the Christians were afraid, were afraid that it was going to go back, and that strong communists were going to take over again, and so they were a little bit reluctant.
[time=2615] They were a little bit reluctant to witness as enthusiastically as they should.
[time=2619] And the rest of the people also were afraid that it was going to go back the other way, and they were afraid to be named as Christians because they had seen what had been done to Christians.
[time=2628] Well, the Lord raised up that coup.
[time=2631] Eight men, you could say eight kings for three days, and then he knocked them down again.
[time=2635] And now, that was their greatest fear that it would happen, and it happened, and it's over.
[time=2639] And now, the whole country believes that they're really free.
[time=2642] And as I traveled across Siberia this last trip, and a number of cities I had never been to, everywhere I went, when I talked to people, they would eagerly want to say, "We're really free now!" Cities where there are no churches, and they're saying, "We're really free!" But we don't know how to live with freedom.
[time=2658] You've got to come, and people have got to come from America, and teach us how to live with freedom.
[time=2662] And every time they would say that, we would hold up our Bible and say, "We have it here!" All you need to know from God's Word right here, and we want to come and teach your God's Word all across the Soviet Union, and all across Central Europe for that matter.
[time=2678] You could describe the Soviet Union and much of Central Europe under two headings.
[time=2683] Proven churches and starving hearts.
[time=2688] I'm privileged to work with church leaders who have been in prison, who have been sent to prison for ten years, or longer.
[time=2695] Church leaders, whose grandfather was a pastor, and he was taken away in the middle of the night, and he never heard of them again.
[time=2701] People like that who stayed firm for the Lord through all those years.
[time=2705] You know, the KGB wanted to kill the church.
[time=2707] Khrushchev wanted to get rid of the church.
[time=2709] He said, "When we have the last Christian, we'll put him on television so everybody can see him." He said that publicly on television in the Soviet Union in the 60s.
[time=2715] The Christians remember when he said that.
[time=2717] And yet the more they did to persecute the church, when they bulldozed over buildings.
[time=2722] And you may not realize this, but as recent as five or six years ago, possession of a Bible in the Soviet Union meant a prison term.
[time=2729] Just to have a Bible.
[time=2730] Not to use it, just to have it.
[time=2732] If they found you had a Bible, they could put you in prison for six to ten years.
[time=2735] Five years ago, okay?
[time=2737] Can you imagine living that way?
[time=2740] So the Christians were denied career advancement.
[time=2743] They were denied education.
[time=2745] And through that process, however, as they maintained the lowest level jobs, they worked as unto the Lord.
[time=2752] They didn't complain.
[time=2753] They studied their Bibles, and they worshipped, and they encouraged one another, and they were close to the Lord in prayer.
[time=2758] They had over the process the Christians have become the most respected people in the country.
[time=2762] They've become the answer people.
[time=2764] Everybody is going to the Christians now.
[time=2766] The Moscow City Council called in the religious leaders last fall to ask their advice on what to do about the problems with the youth in Moscow.
[time=2773] And the Baptist leader who went immediately told the Moscow City Council that there's only one answer.
[time=2778] The answer is faith in Jesus Christ, and then for half an hour the Moscow City Council had a discussion on how they could get Christ to all the children of Moscow.
[time=2785] Can you imagine?
[time=2786] Top PhDs in Moscow.
[time=2789] The famous Academy of Science, respected by scientists all over the world.
[time=2794] There are now 108 PhDs meeting in a new organization, one-year-old, called the Creation Fellowship.
[time=2801] Creation Science Fellowship.
[time=2803] Can you imagine?
[time=2804] Top scientists in the Soviet Union are saying there's not a chance that Darwin was right.
[time=2809] Evolution is a farce.
[time=2810] It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
[time=2812] There have been a creator.
[time=2813] We've got to find out who he was, and most of them have gotten saved already in that group of 108.
[time=2818] The Bible sells for a month's pay in the Soviet Union.
[time=2820] Why does it sell for a month's pay in the Soviet Union?
[time=2823] Because they have seen the lives of the people who are willing to die rather than violate the teachings of this book.
[time=2830] They've watched their lives over the years.
[time=2832] It's been proven to be a book that you could both live by and die by, and the whole country knows it.
[time=2838] The Christians have earned the right to be heard.
[time=2840] They have much more freedom as a result of that than we have here in America.
[time=2844] They have freedom to evangelize everywhere.
[time=2847] There's nothing that you can't do and know where you can't do it.
[time=2850] I mean, we took a singing group right into Red Square in June, on a Sunday afternoon, a hundred feet from Lenin's tomb, and a hundred yards from Gorbachev's office, and we started to sing.
[time=2861] And then in about five minutes, we had a hundred people.
[time=2864] And in an hour, we gave away over 3,000 scripture brochures, 300 verses each.
[time=2869] And people were just reaching like that, trying to get their hands on the Word of God, right in Red Square.
[time=2874] You'd do that all over the Soviet Union.
[time=2877] And while we're fussing about state church issues here in America, their school principals are regularly calling their pastors, the pastors especially of Baptist churches in their cities, and saying, "Won't you send somebody to teach the Bible to all the children?" One pastor told me how he had gone to a principal to ask if he could borrow, if he could rent the school building closest to the church for a Sunday school program, and then in the summers to run like a camp there.
[time=2905] And the principal really surprised him. He said, "Sir, I don't want to rent you the school building." He said, "I want to let you have it free of charge, but there's something you must do for me.
[time=2917] You must send someone to teach the Bible to all the children." And a pastor's wife in that city last year had 13 Bible classes a week in that particular school.
[time=2927] People are just starving.
[time=2929] I was preaching in a city called Chircosa, about five hour drive east of Kiev in the Ukraine.
[time=2937] Beautiful new church building, beautiful.
[time=2941] Six or seven hundred people in the congregation.
[time=2943] I was the fourth sermon that day.
[time=2946] Typical church service, two and a half to three hours, and three or four sermons.
[time=2951] And I was about one minute into my message.
[time=2956] And I had been talking a little bit about how their country had gotten in such a mess
[time=2963] in my introduction about how they had followed the philosophies of men and they had left God out.
[time=2969] And now they were living in the result of that.
[time=2974] And that's how it had happened.
[time=2976] And I hadn't said much more than that.
[time=2978] And a man started down the center hall, the pulpit's over here, and he started down the center hall.
[time=2982] And at first I thought, "Where's a guy just late coming in?" And then he looked like he was coming on a mission, you know?
[time=2989] And my next thought was, "Oh, he was one of those fellows that was out of the hospital for the weekend and one of the deacons will grab him and help him sit down and relax.
[time=2997] He probably needs some medication." And he kept coming.
[time=3000] And he looked like he was coming after me, you know?
[time=3002] And he was about 20 feet away, and I could see in his face his face was lucid.
[time=3006] It was clear.
[time=3007] He was a man who knew what he was doing, you know?
[time=3009] And I just kept preaching, not knowing what's going to happen.
[time=3012] He came right up on the pulpit, right up on the platform right here, and remember the pulpit is over there.
[time=3016] He came right up here, and as soon as he hit the platform he fell on his knees and began to cry out to God, asking God to forgive his sins.
[time=3023] The guy needed to get saved that day, and he couldn't wait for one more message, you know?
[time=3029] He couldn't wait for one more message.
[time=3032] And while he was praying, six more people came up and fell on their knees, and they're all crying out in repentance, asking God to forgive their sins and trusting Christ as Savior.
[time=3041] I just went over and sat down.
[time=3042] I figured I'm done, you know?
[time=3047] They came and got me and had me go and give testaments and minister to them.
[time=3053] And then the pastor said, "Okay, get back up there and keep going." So I got back up and started to preach again, you know?
[time=3059] And at the end of the message I gave an invitation, and six or seven more people came in repentance in the same way, you know?
[time=3066] But I only mention this because this is happening every Sunday all over the Soviet Union.
[time=3071] The problem is there are only 3,000 churches, only 3,000 evangelical Baptist churches
[time=3078] all across the Soviet Union.
[time=3080] There's only about one born-again believer for every 1,000 people in that country.
[time=3088] 1,000.
[time=3089] If every born-again believer was a missionary, they still don't have enough people to reap this harvest.
[time=3093] They desperately need us to send people and come alongside.
[time=3099] You've heard about people standing in line in the Soviet Union, you've got to stand in line to buy everything.
[time=3102] You know, they spend half their life standing in line to buy you.
[time=3104] They stand in a bread line for a while, and then the meat line, and it's awful, you know?
[time=3107] Well, I began to say to the pastors, "Got a sovereign, right?" Yes, of course he's sovereign.
[time=3111] This is about a year and a half ago, I started saying this to them.
[time=3114] I started saying, "Well, then he's allowed these lines to happen, so you ought to try to exploit these lines for decaying them." And they said, "No, you can't.
[time=3120] You mean to evangelize people standing in line, they're all angry." I said, "Well, it's worth a try." So last October I was getting ready to speak at a pastor's conference, about 700 pastors there in Kiev.
[time=3130] And just before I was going to speak that morning, I got up, I was going to speak in the afternoon, and I thought, "I'm going to go out and try this.
[time=3135] I'm going to find out what happens, because these guys may be wrong." So I just stuffed my raincoat to all kinds of tracks, hundreds of tracks.
[time=3141] And the first line I came to where people stand in line to buy cigarettes, about 50 or 60, I thought, "This is a good test." No?
[time=3146] So I started the end of the line.
[time=3147] Long story short, within 10 minutes, every single person standing in line to buy cigarettes is in unison reading God's word.
[time=3153] I wish I could have taken a picture, but it seemed immoral to do it, you know, or something.
[time=3157] I didn't take one.
[time=3158] I've never taken a picture of them reading like that.
[time=3160] And so I decided, "I'll just do a few more." So I went to a few more lines, and I didn't have enough tracks.
[time=3166] So I could go and tell the pastors, "You're wrong." They'll take them.
[time=3169] And so then subsequent pastors' conferences, including this one coming up in two weeks, we're taking just thousands and thousands of scripture brochures, and we're going to take the pastors out and take them to lines, and we're going to have them do it.
[time=3180] The church doesn't quite believe that the people around them are just so hungry, because the people are little.
[time=3186] We're lucky to come rushing to them, because they used to beat them up.
[time=3189] I mean, they respect them, but they used to beat them up, and so we just sort of push them to get them together.
[time=3194] When I get on an airplane, on the Soviet Union, I've done this about six times.
[time=3197] I can't wait to do it on Tuesday.
[time=3198] The first thing I do is go right down the aisle, and usually there are three seats on each side, and just give everybody the whole airplane scripture brochure.
[time=3203] And when it's going down the runway, taking off, the whole airplane is reading God's word in unison, you know?
[time=3207] And you feel kind of safe, you know?
[time=3209] I have a letter here from a city, the farthest east.
[time=3217] It's only an hour and 20 minutes by 200-mile an hour private type two-engine airplane from no Milaska.
[time=3223] We're just there a few weeks ago.
[time=3225] And no church there, and the mayor, and the head of the House of Culture, and the principal of the school, and everybody there inviting us, please come bring people to teach the Bible.
[time=3233] And so we're going to be sending missionaries over there from Milaska, sending international missionaries who will start going over several days a month.
[time=3239] I have a letter here from them that I wish I had time to read excerpts from, where they're just unsafe people begging us to come and teach the Bible.
[time=3245] And the school principal got all distressed, and he had this big horrible look of despair on his face,
[time=3251] saying to me, "I don't know where I'm going to get the budget for this.
[time=3254] I don't have any budget for this. I don't take me while to raise the money." And he was all in distress because he thought he was going to have to pay our missionaries, and he thought he was going to have to pay them in dollars.
[time=3262] He said, "I don't worry, I get the money." I said, "Sir, let me call me your fears.
[time=3266] The churches in America are going to send the missionaries to teach the Bible.
[time=3269] If you could just provide housing, and if you could just provide a place for them to stay at night, and woke up." He was so relieved.
[time=3277] Well, help is desperately needed for these proven churches and for these starving hearts.
[time=3282] We need literature for evangelism, that Bibles are in pretty good supply, and most of the Soviet Union get-ins have done a great job.
[time=3288] Many of the Bible societies have pretty good supply, but literature for evangelism is just desperate to get it there.
[time=3295] And they need resources for church buildings.
[time=3296] They started church buildings, and they had the money to do it, but the inflation's been 400% in one year.
[time=3301] And if the inflation's 400%, it kind of wrecks your building budget.
[time=3304] It costs four times as much as you thought it was going to, anybody's going to run out of money in that case.
[time=3308] And as I mentioned earlier, for $10,000 they can build a 500-seat complex.
[time=3314] Amazing. Because they do all the work, they do all the labor.
[time=3316] That's just for the building, and they usually have about five.
[time=3318] And so we need churches all over America to come along and say, "Do that kind of thing." And they need people to come and help in the harvest.
[time=3323] They need people that'll come who know something about how to organize a Sunday school or a youth program.
[time=3326] That kind of thing.
[time=3327] They need everybody to come.
[time=3328] Church is organized in regions all over, and so we can assign people to each region.
[time=3332] And they're just waiting for us to come and assign people to come alongside it.
[time=3335] And Russian is not a hard language, it's kind of easy to learn.
[time=3338] You know, that's a myth that it's a hard language.
[time=3340] A little Russian kid is just that high, can speak it real well.
[time=3343] Matthew in chapter 9, and I close with this.
[time=3353] From the Word of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ had to be looking as no one, but him can look down into the future.
[time=3364] He was looking down.
[time=3365] I'm convinced.
[time=3366] And part of why he gave these words here had to do with had to be.
[time=3369] Because we have before us the greatest harvest that filled that there has ever been.
[time=3374] And it's not going to last because Western culture, our culture, our culture has an esthetized church in America.
[time=3380] That's another, that's a whole other subject.
[time=3382] Okay?
[time=3383] We've bought into the world's values and it's hard to get people saved here because they don't know they're lost.
[time=3387] Everybody over there knows they're lost.
[time=3389] People in America don't know them.
[time=3391] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir, soloist Kevin Rowe, and a duet from David and Debbie Johnson.
[time=3405] The message today was from our special guest, Dr. Robert Provost.
[time=3409] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ, we'd like to take a moment before we close and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3417] Let's bow together.
[time=3418] Our Father, we thank you that we have this opportunity to just bow our heads and talk directly to you.
[time=3426] I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3431] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3434] I ask you that you will forgive me of the sins that I've committed and become my Savior today.
[time=3439] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3442] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3447] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3455] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or a copy of the message previously given by Russ entitled "Christian Love, Issue of the Heart"
[time=3463] please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3471] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request state number 1519
[time=3478] or mention the sermon by Dr. Bob Provost.
[time=3493] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club, a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry.
[time=3508] To learn how you can become a member of the Founders Club, please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3521] Now speaking for Pastor Russell Moore and the Bible Hour staff, this is Paul Branson writing you to join us each week at this time for the Bible Hour.
