[time=0] Have you ever wanted to just give up, just quit, throw in the towel? Life has
[time=7] become so difficult, so hard that you just wish you could run away from it all.
[time=12] Well, stay tuned because this morning we're gonna see the words of the Apostle Paul to Timothy who was feeling the exact same way. He wanted to quit, he wanted to give up, he wanted to run away. The Apostle Paul has some very interesting and helpful words for him.
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we
[time=45] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] Today Pastor Morris continuing his series of messages from the book of First Timothy. Today's message is the continuation of the message started two weeks ago which Pastor Russ entitled Fight the Good Fight. As he continues his
[time=63] letter to his discouraged friend, the Apostle Paul carefully explains the value of the message that has been entrusted to young Timothy. He challenges Timothy to be faithful to that trust. Have your Bible open to the first chapter of 1 Timothy verses 18 through 20. Before today's message we have the special
[time=83] privilege of listening to the soothing and meditational classic guitar of Jonathan Birchfield and an anthem from the sanctuary choir entitled Oh We Worship.
[time=95] As we begin today's service, please set aside the cares of the world, quiet your heart and listen to Jonathan Birchfield as he plays Sing Alleluia.
[time=113] [MUSIC - 426 seconds]
[time=545] [APPLAUSE]
[time=550] All we worship you are sweet Lord. We continue with music now as Jonathan Birchfield comes back to play a song for us. Familiar words. No one ever cared for
[time=560] me like Jesus. Listen as he plays and review those words in your mind.
[time=567] [MUSIC - 224 seconds]
[time=801] [APPLAUSE]
[time=807] Hello and thank you again for tuning into the Bible Hour. The fall of the year is a very exciting time here in the life of the Bible Hour in the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=815] We have a number of events to take place and I'd like to tell you about two of them coming up on the calendar and hope that you'll mark these dates down and join with us.
[time=823] First we have with us our special guest Bruce Greer. Bruce is going to be here on October
[time=829] 27th all day. You'll be giving a mini concert on the evening of the 27th. That's a Sunday
[time=835] at 6 p.m. Bruce is a fine pianist and ranger. He's written some songs for our own choir
[time=841] and will be joining with our choir in orchestra and playing with us on the piano.
[time=845] A super musician. I hope that you'll join with us on October 27th for that great day.
[time=851] Then another group will be coming with us on November 3rd.
[time=855] The life action singers from Buchanan, Michigan will be joining us that day.
[time=859] In the evening at 6 p.m. they'll present a program entitled The Family Holding On For Life.
[time=865] That's a very important series and this musical will help us understand the
[time=871] plight of the family in this day and age particularly in America and how God is needed in our own families and how we need to incorporate them in our life every day.
[time=881] So two dates October 27th with Bruce Greer and November 3rd with the life action singers presenting the program The Family Holding On For Life.
[time=891] I hope that you'll join with us. Russell it's nice to have you here with us this morning.
[time=895] We're looking forward to your message today but you've introduced me to a book that's been around for a long time by CS Lewis entitled Mirror Christianity.
[time=903] That's our gift offer for this month. Why don't we tell the folks a little bit about it.
[time=907] Thank you Peter. That book was really instrumental in my salvation.
[time=911] I had been raised in somewhat of a Christian home and I had an intellectual knowledge of Jesus Christ but had never personally asked him into my heart and he had never transformed my life through a generation.
[time=922] I was at college and I was looking for a way to junk this Christian heritage that I had.
[time=927] So I began taking some philosophy classes hoping to throw away all the knowledge that I had about the Bible and Christianity but it didn't work.
[time=935] In fact it backfired because I can see through with what little biblical knowledge I had the philosophy of men. Well in my room at that very time was that book and I just kind of by chance pulled it off the bookshelf and began to read it and it's a relatively philosophical approach to Christianity impacted my life in a great way and we want to offer it to you folks. Maybe there's somebody in your life who is debating at an intellectual level with the issues and the claims of Christ. This will be a tremendous book to give them.
[time=963] Maybe at Christmas time maybe just to send it to them with a letter and encourage them to read it. I hope that our folks will write for it. It's a great case for Christianity as Russ has mentioned especially if someone is really struggling with other issues in debating Christianity against some other religion. This is a great case for Christianity.
[time=983] You can receive this booklet absolutely free if you'll write to the Bible Hour today and the address is 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Just ask for the book Mirror Christianity.
[time=999] Again the address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1009] Russell, we had a marvelous weekend last week with the Men's Retreat. We had a Sunday School convention here and more importantly we had Dr. Bob Provost who just kind of set the church on fire as it relates to events taking place in Russia. Was it an exciting weekend? Boy, was it ever?
[time=1025] More than I would have even anticipated. I've received all kinds of communication from people throughout the week even from our own family here at Blackhawk wondering and considering and pondering what God would have them do in response to that message. In fact, I even brought a letter that somebody in my church sent me this week and I've called them and asked them for permission to read it. I won't identify them but I just want you to know we have permission to read this letter. It says, "Dear Pastor Russ I appreciate your bringing Dr. Provost to speak at Blackhawk this Sunday. I write to let you know the impact his sermon has had on my wife and myself. Usually I am not greatly moved by the hardship of others. However, I believe that maybe it was God's spirit prompting me towards a willing and faithful heart. I believe that God may want me to be involved in ministry in some capacity in Russia. But I'm not sure.
[time=1077] Well, of course you needed to check with his wife but he was tentative on doing that so listen to what he says, "Driving home from church I was reluctant to mention anything to my wife as she is very settled here and is looking forward to the possibility of placing our eldest child in Blackhawk Christian school, Lord willing. As we drove home I opened my mouth reluctantly to have my wife simultaneously blurred out. Well, I'm ready to go to Russia because I couldn't believe it. However, I couldn't believe my ears and had to recheck what she had said. It was true without thinking through the awful logistics of going to such a place she expressed a heart for the lost in Russia. The reason that I'm communicating this with you is that I believe it is important to follow God's leading. What does all this mean?
[time=1121] We are content where we are. Are there short term possibilities, missions trips of several weeks, etc. Are there ways to test to see if God is strangely moving us to another direction in our ministry involvement? I don't have much money but the Lord willing I can find the time and effort even in a crazy schedule for a cause such as this. That's really exciting and I think that our church is going to be involved and I think perhaps even the Bible hour in the coming weeks you're going to hear more about events that are taking place in Russia and our response as a church here in America to that need out there in Russia. So that was exciting and encouraging and we've heard others that said I'm considering what I can do for Russia and that's really great. Well, we want to tell you how much we appreciate your faithful giving to the Bible hour and your support and prayer for our ministry here and we hope that you'll continue to pray for us as we endeavor to present the claims of the gospel of Jesus Christ not only in this community but in our surrounding area and eventually throughout the world.
[time=1185] Stay with us and continue to pray for the ministry of the Bible hour. We go back now to our regular service with some more music from Jonathan Burchfield and then the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore. Join with us for the rest of our program.
[time=1207] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=1433] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1441] Wonderful. Beautiful. Thank you so much Jonathan. Well, if you have your
[time=1447] Bibles with you this morning I'll invite you to take them and open to 1 Timothy 1
[time=1453] if you're here with us this morning for the first time we are studying through the book of 1 Timothy and we have come to verses 18, 19 and 20. 1 Timothy 1 verses 18 to 20.
[time=1467] This command I entrust to you Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you that by them
[time=1477] you may fight the good fight, keeping faith and a good conscience which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
[time=1485] Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have delivered over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
[time=1493] As you remember Timothy wants to quit. Timothy has been instructed to remain on at Ephesus and he's finding the assignment very difficult and he'd like another one. He'd like a different one.
[time=1505] With that in mind listen to the maxim, so a thought so a thought reap an action so an action reap a habit
[time=1517] so a habit reap a character so a character reap
[time=1525] a destiny. I don't know if that was running through my parents mind as through my years growing up I came to them wanting to quit things but it seems like it's appropriate. I remember as a senior in high school we'd finished up the football season and it was a small high school and it was my time to go out now for basketball and it was always something I look forward to love to play basketball but there were some guys that normally would have played football that didn't this year and stayed back and practiced basketball the whole time and so when I came from the football field and a few of my buddies to come play basketball there was a sense of resentment and almost a click had developed among them and we were not welcome we were not accepted and even though we'd made our way into the starting lineup they still even in the games and in the practice they really wanted no part of us and that became very obvious and the lack of camaraderie and the lack of teamwork and the lack of mutual support and some things even happened in a game that really just pushed me beyond my limits and so I went home and the next day at the dinner table I said to my mom and dad I said I'm going to quit the basketball team and they said oh really why and I explained all that to them and they had seen some of that and they agreed with a lot of that and thought that I was probably partly to blame and all of that and yet they were aware of the situation and then they said this no you're not going to quit I said why not and they said because basketball season isn't over yet
[time=1607] you can't stop playing basketball until basketball season is over and I said I don't understand this this was my idea to sign up for the basketball team you didn't tell me I had to do this and if it was my idea to get in it why can't it be my idea to get out of it and they said because you're more I said what is it because you're more I said what does that have to do with anything they said well more's don't quit then you're more and you can't quit and the basketball season isn't over so you're not done playing basketball so I finished the season
[time=1635] I tried it again on them when I was a freshman in college I had received a football scholarship to go up and play football for university called Cal Poly State University up in Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and it really wasn't a big college I mean it wasn't a big football scholarship or a big school it wasn't some great thing like Indiana University might be it was more along maybe like a Purdue situation you understand it was got a smaller class program
[time=1665] but in the truth of the matter is I had
[time=1671] become injured and I couldn't play and so I was very discouraged about that and then I had this biology class and there were 350 freshmen in there and we sat in kind of a big auditorium and the guy down front could barely speak English he was a visiting professor from some foreign nation and you could hardly make out what he was saying much less catch on of course a lot of other students seemed to do all right with it that's my excuse and I got a D in my biology class and I didn't like my roommate and I didn't like my dorm and I didn't like any of this stuff so at Christmas I came home and I said mom and dad I think I'm going to pull out a college and they said oh really tell us why and so they listened very carefully to all my explanation and I managed to delete the fact that I had gotten a D because report cards hadn't come out yet but I just said I was kind of struggling with my school work and I said so I'm going to quit and I want to go to work for you dad my dad had a business that I could have entered at that time and made some money and we could have you know we had this kind of life dream I said come on dad you know we'll work together and we'll be buds and this is what we've always hoped for and so I'm going to pull out this Christmas and they said no you're not and I said wait a minute why not and there's the same stuff all over again you know how you get these lessons and they come back
[time=1737] you because because college isn't over yet you have three and a half more years before you're finished with college you can't stop before college is over
[time=1743] and I said but I was my choice to go to college and it can be my choice not to go to college and they said you're half right
[time=1751] it was your choice to go to college and it is now going to be your choice to finish college because you're more and more's don't quit
[time=1757] and college isn't over so go back to school and I did I'm thankful I did I couldn't stand here today if I hadn't got to then finish college and go to seminary and all that stuff you can't quit you just can't quit
[time=1771] and that's exactly what Paul is saying to Timothy you can't quit look at it in verse 18 the thrust of the passage is right there this command I entrust to you Timothy my son in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you
[time=1785] that by them you may fight the good fight stay in there
[time=1791] now you remember he had been left with a very difficult assignment remain on at Ephesus and his primary job there
[time=1797] was to defend the gospel of Jesus Christ to defend the truth in the church at Ephesus against false prophets
[time=1803] from without and from within and it wasn't a lot of fun and in addition to that he had to walk around the city of Ephesus with the memory of the apostle Paul's ministry in that same city
[time=1813] and we looked at that a couple of weeks ago and you remember that the good doctor Luke in the book of Acts records it as this incredible experience for the gospel of Jesus Christ
[time=1823] to come into the city of Ephesus and by the time Paul was done preaching he says there in Acts 20 I think it is that all of Asia had heard the gospel all of Asia had heard from the teachings of Paul and in addition to that he was doing extraordinary miracles which is redundant the miracle is already extraordinary but they were so extraordinary that he put a couple of superlatives on the thing to just help us understand it was out it was extraordinary it was out of the usual something miraculous beyond the miraculous was going on
[time=1853] people were bringing aprons and napkins to his body and Paul would touch him and then the person would take it back to the demon possessed or the sick person and they'd be healed it was way out of line even for miracle workers casting out demons and people were coming to Christ in the city of Ephesus and in repentance they were bringing their magic books into the street and they were burning them right in front of everybody and you remember that finally brought this huge riot because the silver smith there were losing their commerce he literally turned the city of Ephesus upside down and now Timothy is left there without all those enormous gifts and without all that ministry the spirit of God is a unique place in that unique time and now his job is to defend the truth and he's tired of it he wants out I quit I want to go someplace else and you remember we looked to the book of 1 Timothy last time and we saw just how deeply he was wanting to quit he was questioning his calling I'm not sure God really called me to this and we'll look at that this morning these prophecies previously made concerning you in verse 18 indicate that he really wasn't sure God had called him into this after all and that led him to question his capacity for ministry over there in chapter 4 it says to not neglect the spiritual gift within you he didn't think he had enough he wasn't enough as a human being and as a man of God gifted by the spirit of God he said you didn't give me enough gifts to pull this one off and so he was neglecting his spiritual gifts and over in chapter 6 Paul says to flee the youthful lusts and the context there excuse me he says to flee these things later in 2 Timothy he says to flee youthful lusts but the context is materialism and so Timothy is now questioning his commitment to the gospel as an entity he's thinking I'm going to find another way to live I don't like being a pastor I don't think I was called I'm not gifted enough and now I'm going to look out there and find another pursuit another way to live so he was dealing with serious questions about his life I'm so thankful the Bible reveals that kind of stuff I'm so thankful that God is transparent to the blemishes of its leaders you've got it right there in living color this man was a disciple of the apostle Paul himself and he was struggling at a profound level in his life and we could look through the scriptures quickly just in retrospect Abraham is recorded to have lied about Sarah saying that he wasn't that he wasn't her husband Moses is recorded as murdering an Egyptian David is recorded as having adultery with Bathsheba and then marrying her husband Uriah the Hittite to try to cover it up Joe becomes so enraged at God that he with clinch this demands some type of a room in which you can find and grab God and take God into this courtroom and put a third impartial party as umpire and says we're going to do this thing right now God you're wrong and I'm right that's all recorded in scripture Peter denied his lord after he promised not to Paul said that I require a thorn in my flesh because if I don't have this whatever it was this thorn in my flesh I'll become so proud and so arrogant that I'll be useless for the cause of Christ and Timothy is here wanting to quit Timothy wants another assignment and so it is clear that the word of God is faithful to record the struggles of its leaders and here we find them not only struggling but talking we don't hear the actual conversation but we know that somehow Paul and Timothy have communicated and Timothy in that has taken the first step to endurance the first step to his ability to continue to be faithful to the lord and that is he refused to struggle in isolation he refused to hang on to the pretense of spirituality and saying everything is fine I'm fine everything's great in my life I have no problems because somehow that that's what he thinks people want to hear and he's broken through that he shattered that myth and he has told his mentor his disciple or none other than the apostle Paul I am profoundly struggling with my course in life I'm not sure I'm called I'm not sure I have the capacity and I'm not sure I have the commitment to see this thing through and we learn from him we learn from him that we too must be as transparent with the important people in our life or Satan like a pirate will find us as a ship without a fleet we will become easy prey when we isolate each other from one another and from the encouragement and the strength that comes out of real genuine heartfelt commitment as we deal with the reality of our lives we can stand against Satan if we close up and put up a pretense and just look spiritual and hide our concerns and find ourselves in isolation he will win I'm thankful that we see not only their blemishes not only their failures not only their profound questions but also with that the path to faithfulness you want to realize that Timothy didn't quit we have no record that Timothy quit in fact we find Paul writing him a second letter second Timothy three years later so we know for sure at least for three more years he remained faithful and again as I say we have no extra biblical evidence to show that Timothy would have given up on his call to the ministry so Timothy is a great example for us we who would question the calling of God in our life we who would want to exchange this life for another life we who want to quit we who want another path another spouse another job another income another house another church another city whatever it is the word quit doesn't work in the Bible with Christians except to quit your sin everything else we're just supposed to be faithful at and endure and be consistent and to be found faithful as a steward before the Lord and so the thrust of our passage verse 18 the end of it fight the good fight and you remember I told you last time that the word fight fight the good fight that last fight if you will is Stratia in the Greek and it from which we get our word strategy and it describes a massive military campaign of great length that is not a quick skirmish it is not a little battle this is a big long drawn out thing called life called life get used to it Timothy this is not just a brief moment of time in your life you're a fallen man living on a fallen planet and things don't go the way you want them to go then you may as well get used to it that's how my life is that's how your life is and he could have said that's how everybody around you Timothy it feels about their life at one point or another it gets heavy and it's hard and you want to quit but you can't fight the good fight see it as a long drawn out military campaign in which you will be faithful to your chief commander and so in this passage he gives three pictures if you will three pictures of faithfulness and with each picture is a principle that we can apply to our lives in our effort to be faithful to the calling that God has given us three pictures what are they the first I entrust see it at the beginning of verse 18 this command I entrust that's really a banker's word it means to deposit it means to take your money and deposit it with a banker for safekeeping the second picture we've alluded to already to fight the good fight it's that of a soldier and the soldier's responsibility is that of duty do your job and this next picture he brings up in verse 19 is obviously that of the shipwreck or the sailor so three pictures a banker a soldier and a sailor to the banker we are from the banker we learn the principle of stewardship stewardship from the soldier we learn the principle of duty and from the sailor we learn the principle of navigating your life according to the word of God navigation and this morning we're only going to look at the first picture this command I entrust I deposit I give to you as if you were a banker or a steward or a slave of mine and I have entrusted certain things to you and you must now be faithful with what I have given you fascinating word entrust especially as it's used in scripture it describes the life and death drama of redemptive history what do I mean by that it pictures God hanging on to the souls of men as those men entrust their very soul into the hands of God and it also describes the entrusting of the truth of the gospel let me see if I can't make this a little more clear in Luke chapter 23 if we were to go there you don't need to you'd find it a very familiar passage it's the sixth hour darkness is covering the entire land because the sun has been obscured the veil of the temple has been rent and Jesus performs the second to the last act he ever performs in his earthly life i.e. before his crucifixion he does this he cries out with a loud voice "Father into thy hands I entrust commit same Greek word entrust my spirit I am on the brink of death Psalm 22 the bowls of passion are waiting for me the dog stand and gate with open mouths they are ready to devour me I am about to become sin for all of the world and bear all of the weight of the world sin on my shoulders and be separated from you and the last thing I do before I give up my spirit as I cry out "Father into thy hands I entrust I commit my spirit life and death struggle he has nowhere else to turn and so he gives the essence of who he is into the depository or to be banked with his heavenly father let's use another place in the scriptures don't have to turn there but for your reference first Peter chapter 4 verse 19 Peter is writing Peter himself who was crucified upside down in the persecution of Nero who lost his own life he writes to the saints that are scattered in Pontius and Galatia and Asia and Bithynia and Cappadocia and he writes to them on the eve of the most violent persecution of Christians that of Nero and under the persecution of Nero Christians will literally be taken and sewn into animal skins as if it were a coat and then deposited into the Colosseum where the lions will rip them limb from limb for the entertainment of all those who would view in that persecution they were tied they were taken bodily alive and tied to the trees of the royal garden of Nero and then at the proper time as the party was really starting to get going at night they would be lit on fire and burned like tiki torches for the entertainment of Nero's guests Peter writes to the believers who are scattered why are they scattered because they've already endured great hostility for the cause of Christ but it's just a foreshadow of what is coming and he says this to them and now I commend you to God excuse me therefore let those also who suffer according to the will of God in trust their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right he says you believers as you're on the brink of extinction as your body is about ready to be destroyed for the cause of Christ this is my command to you that you entrust it that you deposit it with a faithful creator in doing what is right Paul uses it again with the elders of emphasis on the island of my leaders when he calls them together for the very last time and he warns them about the savage wolves that will move in and wreck havoc on the truth and the doctrine and the church and he says to them I now commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified I now commend the same Greek word I now entrust you to God it's out of my hands I've done everything I can and if the gospel is to go forward in Ephesus I must now commend you to God and of course the same word in our text Timothy this command I entrust to you I deposit with you one of the places I want you to see the word used 2 Timothy 2 2 would you go there for a second? 2 Timothy 2 2 look at it there and these things he's just Paul talking to Timothy
[time=2610] which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses these entrust to faithful men will be able to teach others also for generations and it's all one generation entrusting it to the next generation I Paul received it from Jesus Christ himself the gospel and I am now giving it to you Timothy in order that you can deposit it or entrust it with another a faithful one who will do it in turn again and again and again and again and again and because people have done that you and I have the gospel today it is this faithful entrusting of the gospel discipleship and the truth of scripture which must go on it's the passing of the baton it's the relay race he's saying we got it right here this is 1st century Christianity now here I'm putting it in your hand take care of it and pass it on to another who will run as faithfully as you must and so this is the way of the kingdom this is how the kingdom is built this is how the kingdom goes on it's absolutely remarkable God takes a treasure namely the gospel of Jesus Christ he entrusts it into the lives of people and Paul talks about it in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 as this treasure in my earth and vessel meaning this frail human body made of earth of dust and it's subject to getting broken and worn out and that gospel taking residence and having its power inside this earth and vessel then allows this earth and vessel to live freely according to the commands of Jesus Christ in faithfulness to the great commission and to propagate the good news and in so doing persecution comes and even a premature death to a life as is the case with Paul and Timothy we don't know that for certain about Timothy but likely and as you have been entrusted this incredible treasure the gospel of Jesus Christ and your life brings you now to the brink where your own life is going to be snuffed out and the earth and vessel is going to be broken you entrust your soul to God knowing that you have already entrusted that gospel in another earth and vessel so it can continue to go it's the way of the kingdom and Paul realizes that he is at that point in his own life he holds in his hands this incredibly valuable commodity called the gospel of Jesus Christ how valuable Zacchaeus incredibly filthy rich not very tall ran out in front of everybody climbed the sick of more tree to see Jesus Jesus came for lunch Jesus shared the gospel Zacchaeus got saved and Zacchaeus said this half half of everything I own I'm giving to the poor and if there are those who I have mistreated in my business dealings and there were probably multiples of them I will pay them back fourfold now think about that right off the top half of half of everything he owns and then fourfold repaying those he has dealt underhandedly with it probably broke him he probably had nothing left when he was done and what he is saying is that this treasure of the gospel of Jesus Christ is so valuable to me I'll give up everything else doesn't matter to me Jesus said it this way the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid and from joy over it he goes and sells what everything that he has and he buys that field because he knows what's in that field is more valuable than anything he could possibly have salvation the kingdom of God Jesus said it another way comparing it to the pearl of great price the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls and upon finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought that one pearl man the value of the gospel that has been entrusted to us causes Zacchaeus to give it all away in a response of repentance what shall a man give in exchange for his soul what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? Paul is handling the mystery of Christ Ephesians chapter 2 and 3 that which was not known made known beforehand to the other generations he's got it he knows he is nearing the end of his own life he sees the storm clouds of Nero's persecution forming on the horizon he listens to the spirit of God testifying in his own heart your life is coming to an end and he looks at Timothy his most favorite disciple of them all who he said in the book of Philippians is the only one I can recommend to you to really be concerned for your welfare and he sees the man wavering in the balance he says Timothy wait a minute wait a minute you have a sacred trust you have been given the treasure of the gospel of Jesus Christ and you can't betray it you must go on you must obey
[time=2916] now as individuals I look at my own life I look at your life
[time=2922] I talk to you we have this some of us have this uncanny ability to think of the gospel as God's responsibility and God's alone in other words it goes something like this if I fail with the gospel if the way I treat my wife embitters my wife against the cause of Christ oh she names the name of Jesus maybe she's even saved but there's no real love Ephesians 5 going on in my household somehow that's alright the gospel is bigger than I am it'll keep going if I am bitter my children against the cause of Christ because I'm working too hard or my interests are too diverse or whatever it is that gets in the way of the kind of love that the word of God talks about where we put flesh and bones on the love of Jesus Christ and the gospel and we raise up a godly seed that knows how to compassionately and deeply love the Lord Jesus Christ from their heart not by external rituals and they've seen it evidenced in your life and you forfeit the gospel in their life somehow I don't know God will take care of it the very idea that Paul is driving at here is don't see it that way yes the gospel will go forward yes God will move inextricably to the end of the age and he will save those he is going to save but that is only part of the truth the other part of the truth is that you have been given a treasure and it is your responsibility to treat it as if it were far more valuable than gold and wealth and jewels and to treasure the way you live and the way you impact those around you such that you are entrusting again what one day you will not be able to do any longer because you'll be dead give it to another generation give it to another human being give it to another life thinking about this a man by the name of Alan Saxon came to my mind he's not a believer he was a banker a real life banker in fact he was president of Bullion Reserve of North America 1983 the story occurred he was selling precious commodities and he made them an offer upon their purchase when something like this he offered potential buyers of gold silver platinum and coins two basic options they could take possession of their purchases and worry about where they ought to store them I mean what would you do with a hundred thousand dollars worth of gold where would you put that keep that safe or they could let Bullion Reserve of North America store them free of charge in a mountainside in Utah where they would be safe from theft floods nuclear blasts California sales tax anything you can think of this ultimate production was to be provided by storing the client's metal in individual trusty accounts with Bullion Reserve's wholly owned subsidiary Intermountain Depository Corporation each client's investment would then be segregated from that of the other depositors they took in 45 million dollars of these metals and allegedly stuck them in the mountainside vault in Utah and the people felt man it's safe man I got it now that's where it belongs but in his office on sunset strip in sinful California Alan Saxon was gambling with their money a battery of screens showed him market quotes on those metals from all over the world and he was playing the short term fluctuation trying to gamble on the trade and make all kinds of money he started very strong made a couple of million dollars the first two or three weeks and then lost all 45 million dollars of it in the next two years he had betrayed their trust he had broken their trust listen to his response these are his final words which he spoke September 28th 1983 to his wife in a tape recorder that she could listen to later the worse would be living with the memory of everybody that I everybody who lost money it's bad enough living with it every day for the last few weeks answering letters from people who said they had their life savings with bullion reserve and they trusted us how in the world do you expect me to stop thinking about those people there would be nothing that I could possibly do to repay them how can I live with myself how can anybody live with themselves how can I look anybody in the eye how could I talk to anybody how could I have any kind of faith in myself to keep going Alan Saxon turned off the recorder went over to the little scooter Yamaha scooter that he had in his condominium there on Venice Beach hooked a pipe from the tailpipe over to the sauna went in the sauna shut the door put a towel on the floor to block the passage of air and kill himself
[time=3220] now here's a pagan dealing with filthy luke or money and who understands the gravity
[time=3230] of betraying another person's trust in a traumatic way I'm trying to justify his response of suicide but man he sure felt it didn't he I wish I could feel that level of personal responsibility for the gospel of Jesus Christ in the life of those who call me their friend I can't quit you can't quit well Paul goes on look at verse 18 again this command I in trust to you Timothy my son now watch in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you there was a function of the New Testament prophet in the early church as opposed to the apostles the apostles primarily spoke doctrine they taught truth the kind of stuff you see recorded in these letters the New Testament prophet on the other hand spoke the will and the word of God but usually with respect to a specific situation a specific moment for example I think it's Acts chapter 13 where Paul and Barnabas are set aside for missionary journey number one by a prophet the prophet speaks the word of God and declares you guys go and so it was with Timothy the same thing it happened in his life we don't have it recorded but we see the reference to it if you turn over to 1 Timothy chapter 4 verse 14 you'll see it do not neglect the spiritual gift within you which was bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery there's the prophetic utterance at some point in time in his past one of these new testament prophets about which we don't know a lot came into his life and declared the word of God you are to be a pastor you are to be a preacher this is what you must do and that prophetic utterance in conjunction with you see it there the laying on of hands by the presbytery the presbytery is just another word for the elders the leadership the elders laid hands on him and the elders were really just representatives of the body at large and so here is Timothy singled out his confession of faith being raised in the sacred scriptures his incredible testimony among the believers his discipleship by Paul and eventually a prophet or two comes into his life and says you are set aside by God and then the whole church community representative in these elders lay hands on him and commission him off into ministry that's a huge level of accountability Timothy you didn't get into this thing on your own and you can't get out of it on your own you can't just quit and go to another city you can't give up on the gospel you can't compromise your life because you were put into the ministry by prophetic utterance of God and the confirmation of all the church at large that knew you through the elders it's an enormous amount of accountability that's why in second Timothy four or five Paul says this to him but you be sober in all things endure hardship do the work of an evangelist what a privilege it's been to share with you special music from our sanctuary
