[time=0] The bugle sounds and a young pastor is called to battle, spiritual warfare at the city of Ephesus.
[time=7] Stay with us this morning as we study 1 Timothy chapter 1 verses 18 to 20.
[time=25] Welcome to the Bible House, in our Bible study, Music and Fellowship, which we hope you will find for being encouraging.
[time=32] Thank you for joining us.
[time=34] Today, Pastor Moore will be continuing his series of expositional messages from the book of 1 Timothy entitled "Fight the Good Fight".
[time=42] As we continue studying this letter from Paul, we see the battle-hardened soldier reminding his young charge that his fight is worthy and noble.
[time=51] That position is not an option. Today, we will try to understand why this battle is so important and why Paul would tell young Timothy to fight the good fight.
[time=60] Please have your Bible open to the first chapter of 1 Timothy.
[time=64] Before today's message, we will be ministered to with a selection entitled "Seeky First" from our own handbell choir
[time=72] and a solo from our special guest Kevin Hartman entitled "Lam of Glory".
[time=80] As we prepare for our time at worship, let's listen to the sanctuary choir with soloist Lisa Reniker as they sing "Beautiful Savior".
[time=110] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=279] God has privileged us to live here on this universe and in particular in the Midwest where the seasons change and we've enjoyed great beauty and that's a privilege that we have of living on this earth, the created by God, and we're grateful for that.
[time=295] Let's continue with music as we sing hymn number 278, "Glorious Things of the Are Spoken, hymn number 278."
[time=310] [MUSIC] Glory and honor, glory and honor. [MUSIC] He has prepared not to be broken, glory and honor. [MUSIC] All of our glory makes it sound. [MUSIC] One can stay, but you are before. [MUSIC][MUSIC] Sing a stranger with me now. [MUSIC] Ringing from the earth of war. [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=868] [MUSIC - 61 seconds]
[time=940] [MUSIC] On the cross, God loved the world [MUSIC] While all the parts of hell were so [MUSIC] No one may come to understand [MUSIC] The one may swell [MUSIC] Was Christ the land [MUSIC] Precious love of glory [MUSIC] The most wondrous glory [MUSIC] Oh, God's redemption of life [MUSIC] Glory to the love [MUSIC] Your Israel, I stand [MUSIC] Worship in the land of glory [MUSIC] With the saints I will stand in glory [MUSIC] You've been thanks to the love [MUSIC] of glory [MUSIC] Precious love of glory [MUSIC] The most wondrous glory [MUSIC] It is the heart of God's redemption of life [MUSIC] Glory to the love [MUSIC] Your Israel, I stand [MUSIC] Worship in the land [MUSIC] Worship in the land of glory [MUSIC] The most wondrous glory [MUSIC] Oh, God's redemption of life [MUSIC] Glory to the land [MUSIC] Your Israel, I stand [MUSIC] Worship in the land of glory [MUSIC] Glory to the land of glory [MUSIC] Glory to the land of glory â™ª
[time=1142] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1151] Well, thank you, Kevin. Precious Lamb of Glory.
[time=1155] If you have your Bibles this morning, I'll invite you to take them and open to 1 Timothy 1 where we will continue this morning in our study of Paul's words to his disciple, his true child in the faith, Timothy.
[time=1179] This is 18 to 20. This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you,
[time=1187] that by them you may fight the good fight, keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
[time=1196] Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered over to Satan, so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
[time=1205] The Apostle Paul is endeavoring to carve three images or present three pictures of faithfulness into the mind and heart and soul of his son and the faith, Timothy.
[time=1216] Timothy has been instructed to remain on an Ephesus. It is for him an unpleasant task, one which he wishes he could find another place to minister.
[time=1224] He is questioning his calling, he is questioning his capacity for ministry, he is questioning his commitment to the ministry.
[time=1232] And it's obvious that they have had some kind of intimate discussion about his concerns and his fears and his desire to be placed in another form of ministry.
[time=1242] And so Paul writes this book of 1 Timothy, not only to Timothy, but to the saints at Ephesus, where this all takes place.
[time=1249] We have looked at, at least last week, the first picture that Paul is trying to paint, this command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you.
[time=1261] He's talking in this word entrust about that responsibility of a banker who would receive a deposit of some valuable treasure.
[time=1268] And here the treasure is not silver or gold, but nothing less than the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1273] He is saying that you have received that stewardship, you have been given that great treasure, and you have been confirmed in your ministry by the prophecies previously made concerning you, making reference to the New Testament prophets,
[time=1285] who would have spoken the will and the word of God with specific reference to his life and to his ministry, which was later confirmed by the laying on of hands of the presbytery in 1 Timothy 4.
[time=1296] And in that he brings the accountability of all the church upon Timothy and his life to remain faithful to the task and the stewardship, which is his as that one who is entrusted with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1311] This morning we move on in our thinking to this next picture which is that of the soldier that you may fight the good fight.
[time=1319] He is calling Timothy a soldier in the Lord's army.
[time=1323] And when we think about the soldier, it is clear and obvious that most times a soldier is in the service not by his own choosing.
[time=1333] Oftentimes there is some external threat to his homeland, to his way of life, which compels him to go into the arm forces, if you will, and to fight for the defense of his life, his way of life, his family, his material possessions.
[time=1348] Other times in history people are drafted into ministry or excuse me into war and warfare by some despot, by some dictator or ruler who has ambitious goals for his kingdom and then against his will is forced to fight.
[time=1365] The soldier is a perfect picture of duty.
[time=1368] The soldier's call is to obedience. Another has made your assignment, another has written your orders, and yours is not to question these.
[time=1378] Yours is not to ask for some explanation about them or to be supplied with some justification or rationale before obedience.
[time=1386] The soldier is simply called to obey, always to obey.
[time=1392] And in fact the whole success of any military campaign is typically resting on the part of the soldier to obey, simply to obey.
[time=1404] It is incumbent upon the soldier to do what he is told, when he is told, and how he is told without any questions.
[time=1411] And that probably, though I have never been through it personally, is the whole idea behind boot camp, and some of you men have gone to boot camp.
[time=1418] But it is the idea of stripping away any sense of individuality that I make my own decisions, and I say what time I get up, and I say what I wear, and I say what I eat, and I say what I do when I do it, and how I do it.
[time=1430] And boot camp literally strips a person of all that notion.
[time=1433] They're all, their hair is shaved the same way, they wear the same clothes, they eat the same food, they sleep in the same bunks, and they are given this blessed thing called a drill sergeant who has been hand chosen as the most gruff and rough individual on planet earth,
[time=1446] whose sole purpose in life is to so invade the space of that new recruit that by the time he's done, he only knows his name and his serial number.
[time=1456] And everything else is determined for him by the command.
[time=1460] That's the idea.
[time=1463] And we who live in America, who are so committed to our individual rights, bristle at the idea, that that should happen to us in our Christianity.
[time=1472] In a very real sense, we can applaud our actual military soldiers as they went off into the gulf and obeyed their orders and did exactly what their chief and commander told them to do and enjoyed a landslide victory.
[time=1484] In some sense, when it's somebody else's issue, it's okay, but when you start telling me that that's how I'm supposed to live, I'm a free American, I've got rights, I do what I want and when I want and how I want.
[time=1496] And the word of God begins to say something a little different. No, in fact, you're a soldier. You are stripped of your individuality.
[time=1503] You are now under the command of the chief, namely Jesus Christ.
[time=1509] And it is not up for popular vote or debate or discussion as to how you shall respond to the word of God, just obey it.
[time=1517] Obey it every time. Obey it completely. Obey it without question. Obey it unflinchingly as you go through the trials and trauma of life.
[time=1526] And that really is the picture that Paul was painting.
[time=1529] Timothy, you're a soldier. You are a soldier and your command and post is here in Ephesus.
[time=1536] You can't leave. It's not even an option. You can't question what God is doing in your life. You must obey as any and every good soldier must.
[time=1546] I remember painfully learning the lesson in my life of how prone I am to want to elevate my own reason and rational capacities above the word of God.
[time=1557] In other words, how often it is for me that I'll obey the word of God when it makes sense.
[time=1562] And when it doesn't make sense, as I see it working out in my life, I'm prone to rationalize or reason my way out of obedience.
[time=1570] When we were living back in Southern California, and my eldest daughter, who is now ten, was only about four or so, we had our regular Saturday morning ritual, which was we would wake up and go and jump in the car and drive to the doughnut store and get a couple of doughnuts and some milk and sit on the, you know, curb and talk and play and do what you do on Saturday mornings with your dad.
[time=1589] And we were off and running on another such morning. And I was sitting on the back steps who lived in an apartment and there was a long driveway, which then led to a very busy street. And because parking was scarce, we normally parked on that street on the opposite side.
[time=1602] And so we taught Randy that you can only go across the street when you have the hand of mom or dad, otherwise no crossing the street under any conditions.
[time=1611] Well, I laced up her shoe laces or got her shoes on. I think she was trying to, you know, do that last part herself. And so I went down the driveway and crossed the street and jumped in my car.
[time=1620] And I was just putting the key in the ignition when I looked up and I saw the most precious thing in the world to me running down this driveway and now coming to the curb.
[time=1629] And instead of stopping in obedience, which was her usual pattern, she cocked her head a little bit and paused and then bolted across the street.
[time=1638] And you know the panic that runs through your heart. And as you look in your rearview mirror and you look straight ahead waiting to find out what it is that's going to kill this incredibly gorgeous, wonderful, sensitive, lovely thing that is everything in the world to you.
[time=1650] And fortunately by God's grace, there was no such truck or car that did that. And so she made it safely to the car.
[time=1657] And I tried to collect myself so that I could be a good dad instead of an angry out of control scared half the death out of my mind type dad.
[time=1665] And I picked her up and took her back to the corner of the curb where she should have stopped.
[time=1671] And I said, Randy, what's the rule? This is I'm supposed to stop. It's right.
[time=1676] And how are you supposed to go across? Well, only if you hold my hand. I said, right.
[time=1681] Why did you disobey? I'll never forget her words.
[time=1686] She says, Daddy, I can run faster than the car.
[time=1691] And I say, here's that little quirk. I said, well, just before I'm about to step out of obedience and into disobedience, all this.
[time=1700] And I reason my way out of obedience. I say, I know better. I know more.
[time=1707] And in reality, even if she could run faster than a car, at four years old, you don't understand this thing called timing, you know, and running across the street in a car.
[time=1715] No matter how fast you run, it just happens to be there at the right time and runs you over.
[time=1720] We are so prone, especially in America today, to want to bring our reasoning and our sense of personal rights to the scripture and then reinterpret it and say somehow I'm relieved of that particular duty.
[time=1733] Somehow I'm relieved of that particular responsibility.
[time=1737] And I, of course, see it most often with these marriage vows, where people say for better or for worse, and then they are reinforced in the teaching of the Word of God, that there is no such thing as divorce for two believers, unless there is hard, hard, hard, and unrepentant adultery that continues and continues and continues
[time=1756] and then and only then does God acquiesce.
[time=1759] But we find because our culture is so given to personal rights and making my life work for me that it creeps its way into the church and marriages are beginning to disintegrate on reasons other than Biblical grounds, but there's a rationale for it.
[time=1773] I just can't continue. I've fallen out of love. There's nothing left. There's no reason to go on.
[time=1779] We never should have gotten married. And the Lord just says, man, what are you doing?
[time=1783] What is all this stuff you're talking about?
[time=1787] The Word of God is clear, and we are called to obey it as soldiers out of duty.
[time=1795] And I think of our precious Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1798] And one of the great principles of leadership is never to ask anybody to do something you're not willing to do yourself, right?
[time=1806] And I look at the Lord Jesus and His life, and I see Him agonizing in the Garden of Gethsemane as the great warrior of warriors who is about now to doom forever.
[time=1817] The forces of spiritual darkness through his own death, but before he does, he cries out and says, isn't there any way?
[time=1824] Can't this cut past from me? Don't we have any other options?
[time=1829] And he senses in his spirit there are none, and so he says, nevertheless, thy will be done, and he follows his duty of obedience all the way to his own death and becoming sin out of his responsibility as a warrior and a soldier in obedience to his commander in chief.
[time=1846] Some of the most favorite words that our Lord has ever spoken in my heart and mind, I want to read to you this morning because they speak of his unflinching, unquestioning obedience.
[time=1857] He is Lord of Lords, he is King of Kings, but he has taken and deferred his will and right to his father.
[time=1865] And speaking of his own death, you don't have to turn there, I'm reading from John 8, verse 28, Jesus therefore said, when you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and then here it is.
[time=1877] I do nothing of my own initiative, but I speak these things as the father taught me, and he who sent me is with me, he has not left me alone for, here it is again, I always do the things that are pleasing to him.
[time=1893] This is God speaking about his voluntary role under God the father, and he is saying that I have learned and mastered and now treasure the reality of duty and obedience to the higher command.
[time=1908] I do nothing on my own initiative, I always do the things that are pleasing to him, and no higher commendation can be given to a soldier, and no higher commendation can be given to you or to me, and could you think of it on your tombstone written this, Russell Moore, he always did the things that were pleasing to his heavenly father.
[time=1930] What else could you say? What could be better? Nothing.
[time=1936] Hebrews 12, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=1946] Jesus is the ultimate soldier because he knew the ultimate test of his duty all the way to his own death, and it's so interesting to notice that he gave that of his own volition.
[time=1956] Jesus Christ gave his own life up on the cross.
[time=1961] He was not forced, he was not coerced, he was not threatened in his obedience, and we know that because it says there when he yielded up his own spirit that that was something he did in and of himself.
[time=1973] His life was not taken from him, he gave his own life.
[time=1977] And that is really what Paul begins to drive at here in verse 18, that by them, the end of the verse, you may fight the good fight, the good fight, the word good, coloss in the Greek, is the word for excellence, is the word for worthiness, is the word for a noble cause.
[time=1996] And what he is saying is fight this noble cause, get wrapped up into the reality of that for which you are fighting, and in that find your personal sacrifice worthwhile.
[time=2007] Not all wars are noble wars, and not all wars are nobly fought, but Timothy what you are doing, you are fighting a noble war, and you may not like your assignment, you may not like the way it's going, you may wish you could be placed somewhere else, but you must recognize as a soldier that you have not only been called
[time=2025] to fight, but to fight in a noble war, a worthwhile war.
[time=2030] I remember reading the account of a man who fought in World War II, he fought nobly, he was an obedient soldier, and he received orders to take his command to some island out in the South Pacific.
[time=2043] And it was in the minds of his military commanders a strategic island that must fall if the defeat of the Japanese were to occur, and so he went and he fought, and they lost men, and they lost friends, and they lost lives, and they lost limbs, and great sacrifice was made, and eventually they took the island.
[time=2063] And when the war was all over, and when all had been said and done, it was finally revealed that that island in reality had absolutely no impact on the outcome of the war.
[time=2074] And this guy was writing about how to deal with the reality of having fought for something that just didn't matter.
[time=2081] The Lord will never ask us to do that.
[time=2084] The Lord will never put us in the frustrating situation of a friend of mine who flew in Vietnam, and was utterly convinced that his targets were meaningless.
[time=2093] And he and his comrades risked their lives day after day and night after night blowing up things that didn't matter, and didn't have any consequence in the military strategy.
[time=2102] And of course we're all reminiscent of that incredibly horrible time in our history of our nation when we lost our sense of purpose in Vietnam.
[time=2112] We didn't know why we were there, or some didn't, and the men in the field had lost the sense that the United States of America with all of its resources was 100% committed to one single goal, namely victory, and as a result they suffered incredible turmoil as they risked their lives.
[time=2129] That is not the case for us, and that will never be the case for us.
[time=2134] We fight a noble war. We fight a worthwhile war. And so he says that Timothy, as you remain on at Ephesus, and you confront these savage wolves who come in from among and from outside and spread their spurious doctrines.
[time=2149] And you teach the church to pray and have compassion on the widows and raise up godly leadership.
[time=2154] Be aware of this as uncomfortable as it is you are at least fighting a worthy war, a worthy cause.
[time=2160] And I think of so many today who are fighting better than we are, and they fight for worthless causes.
[time=2168] They are often militant and aggressive and organized and sacrificial and very successful, and they fight for an ignoble cause, homosexual rights.
[time=2178] The people who fight for that have a zeal and an energy and a commitment level that is probably unsurpassed, and they find great success in their endeavors, and they fight for a worthless cause to legalize sin.
[time=2193] Those who are the same with the pro-choice movement, and they are so militant and so organized and so aggressive, and in many cases so successful, they sometimes put us to shame, and they are fighting for an ignoble cause, once again to legalize murder.
[time=2211] And yet we are the ones who have the excellent battle to fight. We are the ones that God has given us the noble cause to participate in all that he is doing.
[time=2222] And even in the context of Timothy's life, he is to compare his battle with that of verse 4 in chapter 1.
[time=2228] These men are teaching strange doctrines in which they concoct out of myths and endless genealogies, and it gives rise only to mere speculation.
[time=2236] The sum total of their life work is speculation, rather than you can see it continuing furthering the administration of God, which is by faith.
[time=2248] God has privileged us to spend and to be expended in a worthy cause.
[time=2255] I was confirming a hunch of mine this week by doing a little outside reading about some of the great motivators towards military conquests, and my mind went to Winston Churchill.
[time=2266] And he does the same thing. He calls his people ultimately to fight and to sacrifice and to give their life because the cause is a worthy cause.
[time=2277] The Nazis were sweeping over the lower countries of Europe, the lowlands. They seemed irresistible. He had already given his nation the program of blood, sweat, and tears, but France had fallen and they were now facing the very eminent possibility of an invasion by Hitler and his troops.
[time=2295] And he preaches what is called the Battle of Britain, one of the greatest speeches given in the 20th century. Let me read to you his concluding remark.
[time=2304] Listen to the sense of cause and purpose to which he calls the nation.
[time=2309] The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned upon us. Hitler knows he will have to break us in this island or lose the war.
[time=2317] If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be freed, and the life of the world may go forward in broad, sunlit uplands.
[time=2325] But if we fail, the whole world, including the United States and all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age, made more sinister and perhaps more prolonged by the lights of a perverted science.
[time=2338] Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that if the British Commonwealth and Empire last for a thousand years, men will still say this was their finest hour.
[time=2353] He understands the call of a soldier is wrapped up in the worthiness of the cause for the military campaign.
[time=2361] Abraham Lincoln did the same thing as he paused amid the cemetery at Gettysburg with the outcome of the war still hanging in the balance he called those who would listen to the cause.
[time=2376] It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.
[time=2388] That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.
[time=2402] He's saying to them everything that we hope for in a government, a government of the people and by the people and for the people hangs in the balance as well it's not just your life.
[time=2412] It's the great cause of America that here is to be disputed and so that's what Paul says.
[time=2420] Long before these men had ever written Paul knew that you may fight the good fight and I'm hard pressed to tell you the truth of a more noble cause than the cause of Christ.
[time=2430] I don't know of a more noble cause than to advance the kingdom of God.
[time=2434] I don't know of a more noble cause than to give your life as a soldier and absolute obedience to the great commission to go into all the nations and with the authority of Jesus Christ proclaim salvation to the lost.
[time=2447] There could be no greater cause and that is what we are doing here.
[time=2451] We're not playing church here at Blackhawk. We are advancing the kingdom of God. We are soldiers in the army of God and we are moving forward with purpose and with direction for the cause of Christ.
[time=2464] I want to take you back to the beginning of the battle just to clarify something.
[time=2467] Would you go with me to Isaiah chapter 14 for a minute?
[time=2471] There was not always a spiritual battle raising on raging and in fact had a very definite beginning.
[time=2478] It rose up in the heart of one by the name of Lucifer.
[time=2482] Isaiah 14 verses 13 through 15 take us to the beginning of what we now fight.
[time=2497] Take us to the beginning of the battle but you set in your heart and by the way the context here is of the ruler of Babylon who is really only a pawn in the hand of Satan as so many national leaders are.
[time=2510] And what is really being directed to here is the heart and the activity of Satan.
[time=2516] Verse 13 but you said in your heart I will ascend to heaven.
[time=2520] I will raise my throne above the stars of God and I will sit on the mount of assembly in the recesses of the north.
[time=2529] I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will make myself like the most high.
[time=2537] Here is the proud, insolent, arrogant heart of Lucifer who says I will now rival the most high.
[time=2544] I will take the position and seat myself with the God of gods but that God responds in verse 15 nevertheless.
[time=2552] You will be thrust down to shield to the recesses of the pit.
[time=2559] Here is the beginning of the battle. This one called Lucifer or day star has become a usurper who is full of pride.
[time=2568] Revelation 12 tells us that when he fell his tale took with him a third of the heavenly host meaning the angels.
[time=2575] We don't know how many that was, how many millions and millions or zillions of angels that would have been.
[time=2580] When the Bible refers to how many angels there are it speaks in terms of multitudes and multitudes or thousands and thousands which is at that particular point in history.
[time=2588] They are greatest numerical expression. It would be for us zillions and zillions, zillions and zillions of them and a third of them fell with him.
[time=2597] His very name Satan means enemy. It is translated without the definite article as enemy or just adversary and with the definite article it is translated Satan.
[time=2607] He is also called the destroyer, the accuser of the brother and the adversary, beelzable, belial, deceiver of the world, the great dragon, the evil one, the father of lies, the god of this world.
[time=2617] A liar, a murderer, the prince of the power of the air, the ruler of this world, the ancient serpent, the tempter.
[time=2626] He is all of these things but he is preeminently all of these things in confrontation to God.
[time=2632] The real battle is between God and Satan. We are incidental.
[time=2638] You and I as members of the body of Christ are incidental to the real battle that has been raging since the beginning of time.
[time=2646] His biggest issue of course is with the person of Jesus Christ who from the first prophecy knew that the salvation would come through the seed of the woman has been trying to destroy that seed.
[time=2657] First in Genesis 6 by causing some of his demons to cohabitate with women and thereby produce a demon race that would make redemption impossible which God then destroyed in the flood.
[time=2668] He then worked with all of his might to corrupt the nation of Israel to wipe out any possibility of a godly seed and was so successful at points that even kings of Israel had to be passed in the lineage to Christ because they were so wretched and so wicked.
[time=2682] When Christ was finally born he was after the babies through Herod and here again the point is made. He didn't really care a lot about the babies who he really wanted was the baby, the Jesus and in the process would massacre thousands to find his victory in killing the one Christ.
[time=2699] When ready now for ministry he took him into the wilderness and tried to compromise his moral qualifications to be king of Israel enticing him to change the stones to bread to throw himself from the high pinnacle.
[time=2711] And if he would just worship Satan, Satan offered him all the kingdoms of the world.
[time=2718] Satan tried to draw his life to a premature death without the cross several times in the ministry of the life of Christ as he would minister and perform miracles.
[time=2727] Satan would work in the religious leaders and in the crowd to bring them to a frenzy and hope that they would somehow seize and grab and kill him before he could die on the cross but miraculously Jesus would slip from their hands and from their myths.
[time=2740] He tried to kill Christ in the garden, he tried to kill him on the cross, he tried to keep him in the grave and when Christ returns again he will fight him there until he is finally thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2750] The real battle friends is between Satan and Christ and you and I only get a piece of the action because we represent Christ.
[time=2758] We are not the issue Christ is and it is our noble cause to stand in the stead of Christ as he now sits at the right hand of the throne of God and take the blows which Satan would offer and really intend for Christ but we receive them.
[time=2773] Colossians 124 Paul says as much, "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of his body which is the church in filling up that which is lacking in Christ's afflictions."
[time=2792] Colossians 124, "I am filling up that which is lacking in Christ's affliction." There was nothing insufficient in the atonement of Christ on the cross, he was complete and it was totally sacrificial.
[time=2805] What is still left is the venom and the hate and the despicable jealousy of Satan for Christ and for God and as long as he is capable he will continue to throw his darts at those who stand in Christ's stead which was Paul and is now you and me.
[time=2821] Galatians 617 he says it again, "I bear on my body the brand marks of Jesus and I'm proud of it."
[time=2828] These marks you see that are on my body because I have tried to faithfully obey as a good soldier, the great commission.
[time=2834] These are the brand marks of Christ. This stuff was really intended for Christ but he's not here so I had the privilege of standing in his stead.
[time=2843] So Timothy fight the good fight. Fight the good fight. Be faithful.
[time=2852] Know that what you give yourself to is a noble cause and take your place in rank and file offering to your king absolute unquestioned, unflinching, immediate obedience to his command.
[time=2865] And rejoice in the fact that as you do that with a full whole hearted obedience because the cause is so worthy that you take the blows intended for your Savior.
[time=2884] I don't know what fight you're fighting today. I bet you have a spiritual battle. I wish I knew.
[time=2889] I wish I knew what was going on there. I wish I could speak specifically and try to encourage you specifically in the details of your particular spiritual battle for the cause of Christ.
[time=2899] I don't know if it's your marriage. I don't know if it's your health. I don't know if it's your finances.
[time=2905] I don't know if it's a battle for mental purity or a struggle against gossip but what is clear from the life of Timothy is that each of us has at least two battles to fight.
[time=2914] There is first the battle in our own private life and he is beginning to lose it as he questions his calling and questions his capacity and questions his commitment.
[time=2923] And you and I have our private battles to fight and we must shed from ourselves the sin that so easily besets us.
[time=2930] We must get it out of our lives so that we can get back into the real arena and be useful in advancing the cause of Christ.
[time=2940] We must get out of our life the sin that would keep us from being faithful to our commander in chief.
[time=2947] And once beginning to live that pure life continue to sacrifice out of a sense of call and duty to the cause of Christ.
[time=2955] Sacrificing your time and your money and your energy and your life blood even as Paul did.
[time=2962] Even as Timothy is being called to do for the cause of Christ because it is a noble fight because it is a noble war.
[time=2972] I was so thrilled I got a letter that is really just a sampling of I think what the Lord is doing in our congregation in response to Dr. Provost's visit.
[time=2980] I have permission to share this though I won't give you the name but I want you to hear it.
[time=2985] Dear Pastor Russ I appreciate your bringing Dr. Provost to speak at Blackhawk this past Sunday.
[time=2990] I write to let you know the impact his sermon had on my wife and myself.
[time=2994] I am usually not greatly moved by the hardship of others however I believe that maybe it was God's spirit prompting me towards a willing and faithful heart.
[time=3004] I believe that God may want me to be involved in ministry in some capacity in Russia but I'm not sure.
[time=3009] Driving home from church I was reluctant to mention anything to my wife that she is very settled here and is looking forward to the possibility of placing our oldest child in Blackhawk Christian school Lord willing.
[time=3020] As we drove home I opened my mouth reluctantly to have my wife simultaneously blurred out well I'm ready to go to Russia.
[time=3028] However I couldn't believe my ears and I had to recheck what she had said. It was true without thinking through the awful logistics of going to such a place she expressed a heart for the lost in Russia.
[time=3041] The reason that I am communicating this with you is that I believe it's important to follow God's leading.
[time=3047] Follow God's leading.
[time=3049] What does all this mean?
[time=3051] We are content where we are. Are there short term possibilities, missions trips of several weeks etc.
[time=3058] Are there ways to test to see if God is strangely moving us in another direction in our life?
[time=3064] I don't have much money but Lord willing I can find the time and effort even in a crazy schedule for a cause such as this.
[time=3074] Many of you folks have come up to me and expressed how are you going to get me to Russia? How do I get to go over there? How do I get to help?
[time=3081] How can I be a part of this? And I don't want to hold up this one example and say that if you're really going to be a soldier it means you've got to become a missionary because that's just not true.
[time=3088] Many of you need to stay right here and continue to sacrifice and continue to evangelize and continue to build your family and love your wife and all of us working and God will take some and send them overseas.
[time=3098] But that's the spirit of it all. There is that sense of dedication and love and commitment and willingness to allow an entire course of life to get turned upside down if in fact the marching orders come through that were to head in a different direction.
[time=3116] Let me show you the wrong battle. Let me show you the wrong battle to fight. James chapter 4. You want to know what not to fight?
[time=3132] Since the church has begun this battle has kept it from fighting the true and real battle, the noble battle.
[time=3140] James chapter 4, what is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? There's the wrong battle, conflicts and quarrels among the church of God.
[time=3149] It keeps going. It's not the source who are pleasures that wage war, that's the same Greek word that we've got in our text over in 1 Timothy.
[time=3158] That wage war and your members, you lust and do not have so you commit murder, you are envious and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel, you do not have because you do not ask.
[time=3170] Through the centuries of the history of the Christian church this has been the plague that has kept it from really advancing the kingdom of God and fighting the noble fight.
[time=3179] They were too busy fighting each other, too much in fighting because of the lust and the jealousy and the envy that can exist inside of a home and then inside of a church.
[time=3191] In our marching duties are not to fight this war, we are to be away with this war to give up our lusts and our desires and our jealousy and our envy and to find as every soldier does his place in the battle and willing to give his own life because the cause is so worthy.
[time=3209] "Stop fighting," he says, "amongst yourselves there is a bigger, more important battle." One more scripture, you're saying, "How do I fight it?"
[time=3222] Well come with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 10, this really touched my heart this week. Look at the 2 Corinthians chapter 10, this is amazing. Paul is talking about the warfare, he's talking about the fight, the season veteran that he is, a general in the Lord's army.
[time=3246] 2 Corinthians 10, verse 3, "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses."
[time=3262] He's saying we cannot fight this fight in the natural resources of our own flesh, our own personality, our own giftedness. We must fight this with the weapons of warfare that are powerful, divinely powerful, divinely given.
[time=3279] Look over in verse 10 for a minute, you'll see that he's being confronted in his apostolic ministry by some who are saying that he's not impressive enough in his personal appearance. For they say verse 10, his letters are weighty and strong, but his personal appearance or presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.
[time=3300] I was reading this week the biography of Keith Green, who many of you know was a tremendously gifted musician greatly used of the Lord some years ago. And although I don't agree with all of his theology, man, I sure appreciate his life. I appreciated his ministry of music, it touched my life in a deep and great way and still does it this day. I love to listen to his music.
[time=3320] But as I was reading this biography written by his wife, I began to think of Keith Green and you know this man was marvelously gifted. He would come out onto a stage and all there would be is a piano and literally thousands of people would gather to listen to his lyrics to his tune by his voice coming out of his heart.
[time=3342] I mean the whole thing was just something he created as the Spirit of God would allow him to do that and at some points as many as 35,000 people would gather to listen to his music and to pray with him and to be invigorated for the things of God.
[time=3355] All just spinning out of his abilities and talents and gifts.
[time=3361] I was so thankful when I came across this insert in his journal. It was 3.15 am on the eve of one of these huge concerts. He said this I can't sleep.
[time=3372] An angel wants to burn my lips with the coal. I must count the cost. Isaiah 6 and 7. Here am I, send me. He's talking about Isaiah 6 and the Lord with the coal burning the lips of Isaiah to purify him for ministry. He feels dirty, he feels inadequate, he feels unprepared.
[time=3389] He goes on. Prayer is the key. Make me a man of prayer. I want to be God's voice full of love, mercy and fire, but I must be dead.
[time=3400] I am ready for death. Kill me. Destroy me.
[time=3409] A privilege today to share with you music from our sanctuary choir, our hand bells and guest soloist Kevin Hartman. The message today was from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3420] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. Why don't you bow and pray with me right now?
[time=3430] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this opportunity to bow before you today and tell you that I've sinned against you and that I need you as my Savior.
[time=3440] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3449] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? And when you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
