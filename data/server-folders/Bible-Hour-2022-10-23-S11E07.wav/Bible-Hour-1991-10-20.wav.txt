[time=0] A conscience is the little voice inside, accusing or defending you in your
[time=6] thought life, your behavior, your actions. What happens when you deny your conscience,
[time=12] when you stop listening to it? Stay with us this morning as we find out what's happened to two men, Hymenaeus and Alexander, they've seared their conscience as with a branding iron.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we
[time=40] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today Pastor
[time=46] Moore will be continuing his series of expositional messages from the book of 1 Timothy entitled "Fight the Good Fight." Paul has already given Timothy the motives and means to carry on this battle, but what if those were not enough? What if Timothy still chose to quit? Study with us this week as Paul describes the consequences that come from deserting in this great spiritual war. Please have your Bible open to the first chapter of the book of 1 Timothy. Before today's message we will be ministered to with a solo from Lisa Renicker entitled "O Glorious Love." And two selections from our own praise kids entitled "What Do You
[time=86] Give to a God Who Has Everything" and a medley entitled "Do You Ever Talk to God?"
[time=92] As we prepare for our time of worship let's listen to the sanctuary choir and the combined children's choirs as they sing a song entitled "Let His Children Rejoice."

[time=629] [MUSIC]
[time=636] Thank you for joining the Bible Hour today and staying tuned I appreciate the ministry of the Bible Hour and I hope that you've been blessed this morning.
[time=644] Russell we've heard some good music from Lisa Rennaker and then the sanctuary choir and all the children together singing with them that really blessed my heart.
[time=652] Well whenever the children get up and sing everybody seems to love it and I of course was especially excited this morning.
[time=657] I have three daughters in that group and they were all getting ready this morning and could hardly wait to come and sing.
[time=662] That's exciting we're going to hear a little bit more from our praise kids grades four five and six.
[time=667] We really are appreciative of all the volunteers that work with our children not only in their in their choirs but in our Sunday school programs and if you don't have a church home and you need to come and visit Blackhawk Baptist Church and see all of the many activities that are available for the entire family.
[time=683] I want you to take note of this date coming up November 3rd we're going to have the life action singers here.
[time=689] That's an ensemble of men and women that travel the country they'll be here with us in the morning on the third
[time=695] and then in the evening they'll be presenting a program entitled the family holding on for life.
[time=701] Once again that's November 3rd at 6 p.m. at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=706] I hope that you'll join with us at that date aside and come and be encouraged by their ministry with us November 3rd at 6 p.m.
[time=715] And then Russell we've received a lot of letters prayer requests and that's an indication that people are watching
[time=721] and we've been faithful and presenting those prayer requests to the staff and I'm really grateful that people are writing in and they can also write in for a booklet that we have that's available.
[time=732] Absolutely it's entitled CS Lewis actually it's entitled Mirror Christianity it's written by CS Lewis and Peter as we're always concerned about our efforts in evangelism what I have found even as I was out
[time=743] Wednesday night sharing the faith with somebody it's it's such a helpful tool if you can leave something in their hands
[time=749] that after you've gone they can read they can study they can look at on their own it seems to put them at ease and allows them to go back over the content and this has got to be one of the very best books if you know of somebody who is interested in the claims of Christ
[time=763] if you've been sharing your faith or even just your life it's so simple to hand them a book like this
[time=769] and just say you know I don't know if you're interested in reading this I have a copy if I like you to have it and if you ever read it well I really think you'd enjoy it and then you can back off and just continue to live your life in front of that person and it really makes for a strong evangelistic tool in their life
[time=784] well it's a great book Russell even it's in three sections I believe in the first section I like the title is the case for Christianity so if you would like to read this book or you have a friend that could use this book
[time=795] I hope that you'll write for it today and you can receive it by simply writing to the Bible hour seventy four hundred east state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is four six eight one five
[time=807] once again that's the Bible hour seventy four hundred east state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is four six eight one five
[time=816] Russell we've received a number of requests for living Christmas tree tickets to the Founders Club if you're a member of the Founders Club you should have received a form to request tickets for the living Christmas tree

[time=1302] as we give them an opportunity to exit why don't you all stand and greet each other this morning?
[time=1307] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=1354] what an absolute, unadulterated joy thank you kids I got a chance to shake some of the hands up here and let me tell you some of them are really sweaty palm [laughter] in a panic what are we doing up here in front of all these people?
[time=1370] wonder that myself sometimes [laughter] if you take your bibles and open them to 1 Timothy chapter 1 and honest I promise I'm trying to get us out of these three verses verses 18, 19, and 20 which are the words of the great apostle Paul to his true child in the faith about not quitting about not giving up about being faithful to the ministry that God has given him and we have found the passage to be full really of three pictures which gives us a principle for being faithful in our Christian lives the first picture was that of a banker and the word was in trust to be a steward of this incredibly valuable thing called the gospel of Jesus Christ which must be given to the next generation and if we don't do it then Christianity is but one generation away from utter extinction past the baton continue to be faithful to it the second picture was that of a soldier and Paul reminds Timothy that when he has become a Christian and now that he is a believer and he is a member of the Lord's army if you will he has given up his rights he has given up the opportunity and the privilege to dictate the course of his own life and it is now his lot in life to obey his commander in chief namely the Lord Jesus Christ and so the theme for the soldier is duty duty to be committed to the fight the good fight the noble cause but in no way to demand reason or explanation or justification for the orders of God simply to obey them immediately and completely and this morning we come to the last picture and that of the sailor the sailor who must navigate his life if you will according to the word of God and these men as you see in verse 19 have suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith
[time=1482] they have failed the task they have run the ship of their life aground and it is broken and destroyed their faith is ruined their names of course are Hymenaeus and Alexander now Paul draws upon I guess his own experience in shipwreck 2 Corinthians chapter 11 says that he has three times I suffered shipwreck and we don't have all of them recorded we do see one of them in Acts chapter 27 I'd like you to go there with me just briefly to be reminded of the devastation that accompanied his experience in this shipwreck and that's really the picture that Paul is painting an absolute utter devastation of a life to suffer shipwreck the faith
[time=1526] Acts chapter 27 Paul is being transported to Rome where he has appealed to Caesar
[time=1532] he has gone through all the harangue of Agrippa and Festus and Felix he said enough is enough semi to Rome I'm a Roman citizen I appeal and now he's in the process of getting there and so in verse 13 they are sailing the end of verse 13 a long creek close in shore it's a little island out in the middle of the ocean
[time=1553] verse 14 but before very long they are rushed down from the land of violent wind called Yuroquilla and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind we gave
[time=1564] way to it and let ourselves be driven along and running under the shelter of a small island called Colada we were scarcely able to get the ship's boat under control
[time=1575] and after they had hoisted it up they used supporting cables and undergirding the ship and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Certus they let down the sea anchor and so let themselves be driven along the next day as we were being violently storm tossed they began to jettison the cargo
[time=1593] and on the third day when they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands verse 20 and since neither sun or stars appeared for many days and no small storm was
[time=1604] a sailing us from then on all hope of our being saved was greatly gradually abandoned
[time=1610] unbelievable look at verse 27 but when the 14th night had come as we were being driven
[time=1618] about in the Adriatic Sea about midnight the sailors began to surmise that they were approaching some land and they took soundings and found it to be 20 fathoms and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be 15 fathoms and fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks they cast four anchors from the stern and wished for daybreak they're approaching being shipwrecked and
[time=1642] they're terrified and they're wishing with all their might that daybreak might come upon them verse 30 and as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the
[time=1652] ship's boat into the sea on the pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow now even these sailors in the company of a Roman guard were trying to escape because they knew the devastation that was about to be upon them it's finally there in verse 41 but striking a reef where two seas met they ran the vessel aground and the prow struck fast and remained immovable but the stern began to be broken up by the force of all the waves unbelievable these sailors themselves seasoned on the sea knew the utter devastation and destruction that awaited them when the event of their shipwreck was to about to occur and they were doing anything they could to get off and get away from it all and though the account doesn't completely describe the devastation that came to the ship that explains as miraculous that everybody got off and alive and that was only due to Paul's leadership as he was being led by the spirit of God Paul has in his mind a vivid picture of absolute utter devastation and destruction that accompanies the shipwreck and he applies it from the literal sense to people who have done the same in their faith they have shipwrecked their faith you say how did they do it how did they accomplish this how did they run the ship of their life aground if you will well it's found right there in verse 19 1 Timothy 1 verse 19 keeping faith and a good conscience which some have rejected there it is keeping faith and a good conscience which some have rejected they have apatheo which is the word of the Greek for rejected and it means to violently get rid or discard an object they have taken their conscience and they have violently thrown it away from them deliberate active movement to get it away from their lives the word faith here in verse 19 keeping faith is really the word not for the subjective sense of our Christianity the assurance of things hope for the conviction of things not seen the idea here of faith talks about the content of Christian truth doctrine theology they have taken faith and then a good conscience and they have thrown it away now the word conscience and I want to focus on that this morning because that is really what is implied here they have thrown their conscience away the conscience is man's moral intuition this is the marvelous vehicle that God has given us that takes the principles of the word of God and applies them to the day by day circumstances of our lives come with me to Romans if you will chapter 2 we'll look at a few passages this morning about the conscience Romans chapter 2 verses 14 15 and 16 here Paul is describing the Gentile the one who does not have the law capital L the person who has never been in church the people that you and I would think of when we imagine a very remote part of the world a uncivilized place and people who have never even received the word of God in their own language here God is describing them Romans chapter 2 verses 14 through 16 for when Gentiles who do not have the law do instinctively the things of the law these not having the law are a law to themselves in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them on the day when according to my gospel God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus the conscience is here explained first of all people who may have never ever even read a Bible or seen the scripture in their own language are born with the law of God capital L the Ten Commandments basically the moral absolutes of God written upon their heart it's inescapable everybody who's ever been born has that written in their heart they know that God exists and they know that God has moral absolutes and it's the conscience that God has given them that when they begin to practice their life and live out their life and if what they are about to do is contrary to the law or the moral absolutes of God their conscience screams at them and says don't do that or if what they are about to do in some kind gesture or some self-sacrificing gesture is in fact commensurate or consistent with the word of God their conscience affirms them in that the universe 15 their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them it is man and is moral self in the act of passing judgment upon his own state his own emotions his own thoughts his own actions his own words his own deeds whether those would have been past present or future your conscience will tell you whether what you have done what you are doing or what you are considering doing is consistent with the word of God and when the conscience finds its rejuvenation if you will in the believer when that which is given to all men the conscience is bound up now in the heart and soul of a believer somebody who is new in Christ and a person who is being led into understanding the scriptures by the spirit of God a person who is renewing their mind the conscience reaches its highest goal and level for you and I who know and love Christ our conscience reaches its highest level and its ability to give us practical application of the word of God in our daily lives to either affirm or to charge us with respect to our behavior our conscience if you will is that thing which tells us to get up out of bed in the morning it's time to go to work it's that thing which tells us to get up and go to bed at night because we need our rest to change the channel when we're watching television to help our neighbor to hold our tongue to buy or not buy the new dress to eat or not eat the dessert to ask forgiveness it is a remarkable thing that God has given us in our conscience and it is this which these men have violently thrown overboard it's as if it's the rudder of their ship and they don't want to navigate anymore so they take the rudder and throw it over they throw their conscience overboard now it's true that a conscience can be somewhat subjective at times turn over a few more pages to Romans chapter 14 if you will and you'll see some more discussion about the conscience Paul is here talking about
[time=2080] food that is considered unclean by some verse 14 says I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing nothing is unclean in itself but to him who thinks anything to be unclean to him it is unclean in other words people would have come out of this idolatrous worship of the age in which offering food idols was a part of all of that and you could oftentimes buy some of that food after it had been offered and then you bring it home and cook it and prepare it and eat it and for some typically those who had been involved in that cultic behavior that symbol behavior the thought of sitting down at a plate of meat that had come from one of those temples was impossible for them to consider they felt convicted deeply in their heart and life by their conscience that they cannot eat that food it brought back too many memories it was too closely tied to their life prior to coming to Christ other folks not having had that particular background could look at that meat that had been involved in some idolatrous worship and say see it's not unclean it doesn't matter what you do to that meat I mean you haven't touched it physically it's been involved in some weird satanic ritual but it hasn't changed the meat it's fine I can eat it with the clear conscience so there is a level in which the conscience is somewhat subjective I'm always reminded when talking about this of the situation that C.H. Spurgeon had the famous preacher godly man men wanted to come and learn how to be a pastor and a preacher from him so he started the pastor's college and one day was walking unannounced into the lobby of his college and saw there a man smoking one of his students and because Spurgeon had come in rather unannounced the man was caught off guard and is instantly upon seeing that it was Spurgeon began to put his cigarette out and try to hide it and push the smoke away and pretend as if it had never happened
[time=2190] so the great preacher walked over to him and rather a robust man and stood right there in front of him
[time=2196] opened his jacket pulled out this big huge cigar bit off the tip put it in his mouth lit it took a few puffs and looked at his pupil and said for you it's sin for me it's not sin in other words Spurgeon was of the opinion as am I that the bible makes no absolute biblical comprehensive prohibition against smoking I don't think it's wise I don't do it but I don't think I could stand up here and prove to you that no matter where you are who you are when you are what you are thou shalt not smoke I wouldn't say that it's a gray area some people have liberty to smoke others don't apparently this guy sitting in that pastor's college thought he had the liberty to smoke until an authority figure showed up until Charles hadn't Spurgeon showed up and then suddenly his conscience was saying to him ah put this out get this away from me he was violating his conscience he was sinning see for him it became sin because he didn't have peace in his mind and his heart to do it his conscience was saying no for a man like Spurgeon who apparently had reached a place of peace a place I have not found but a place of peace with the prospect of smoking there it wasn't sin they could do it right there in broad daylight no conviction no conscience no alarms no sirens and that's what Paul is saying here look down to verse 23
[time=2286] but he who doubts is condemned if he eats
[time=2292] because his eating is not from faith and whatever is not from faith is sin though there's nothing wrong in and of itself with the particular food though there's nothing wrong with eating that food but if your conscience does not give you the liberty to eat that food and you eat it anyway for you at sin what Paul is saying to Timothy is that these men
[time=2320] have shipwrecked their lives because they have time and time and time again gone against what their conscience has told them they have gone against the inner voice inside of them and as a result have led a disobedient life and it has eventually brought them to the place of being shipwrecked Paul is absolutely fanatical about the conscience and its protection would you look with me in 1 Corinthians 8 you'll see a similar discussion I think sometimes we are lax with our conscience we have ways of justifying violating our own conscience and it's helpful to be reminded of the intensity that Paul approached the conscience with he says in 1 Corinthians 8 verse 9 but take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling block to the weak in other words you may have liberty to eat a certain thing that's been offered to an idol but don't use that liberty in such a way that it hurts or damages another brother verse 10 for if someone sees you who have knowledge dining in an idols temple will not his conscience if he is weak be strengthened eat things sacrifice to idols for through your knowledge he who is weak he calls it ruined he is ruined the brother for whose sake Christ died in other words if you take your liberty and you just flaunted in front of a weaker brother who doesn't have that kind of liberty and you in a sense provoke or push him in to a behavior which his conscience is saying no Paul describes it as having ruined him it's not that he lost his salvation in this case it's just that you let him into sin look at Paul's response in verse 13 therefore if food causes my brother to stumble I will never eat again that's remarkable that I might not cause my brother to stumble Paul was so committed to the truth that your conscience is a valuable tool of navigation the rudder of your ship that you must always obey it you must always obey it and you must always be careful to protect that thing in another individual because once that has begun to be violated you have set yourself on the course that which leads to shipwreck it's a strong word it's a compelling idea come back with me now to 1 Timothy 4 1 Timothy 4 this time and again these men are being described and their conscience is spoken of yet again 1 Timothy 4 verses 1 and 2 but the spirit explicitly says that in latter times some will fall away from the faith paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons now here it is by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron in other words the hypocrisy of their life the ability that they somehow had to live a two-faced life to be promising life in Christ but offering a damning heresy built on myths and genealogies which leads only to speculation and that not only in their teaching but apparently in their lifestyle they have so ruined that conscience which God had given them it's seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron that's a very painful picture it's a very violent thing to so damage your conscience that it's now seared picture being of a hot foreign object just wrenching and destroying the sensitivity that would be there with this hot branding iron through sinful behavior we are to be those who instead
[time=2560] keep faith and a good conscience look again at 1 Timothy 1 19 he says at the very beginning of verse 19 keeping faith and a good conscience the word keeping could have been translating holding on to desperately grasping Timothy as you are now in the fight in the fight for your faithfulness in the fight against the temptation to quit and question your calling and question your capacity and question your commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ what you must do is to view yourself as a sailor who is holding on if you will to the rudder his faith and his good conscience and preserve and protect it at all costs over and over again in the book of 1 Timothy faith and conscience are aligned together three times once in 1 5 once in 1 19 and once in 3 9 they are coupled faith or doctrine and conscience meeting practice or morality over and over again they are pulled together and we are again reminded that there is an inseparable connection between faith and practice in other words if you corrupt one you will always corrupt the other if you have a bad doctrine you'll eventually have bad morality and if you have bad morality you'll eventually have bad doctrine you can't separate the two you cannot separate the two and so he calls this young pastor to confront these other two men Hymenaeus and Alexander who by the way we know very little about Hymenaeus shows up a little later in this book Alexander is a very common name it just means defender the word Alexander or the name Alexander is given to a man in Acts chapter 19 it shows up again in one of the pastoral epistles but there's really no connection between those men and this Alexander in other words we don't know where they came from we don't know about their parents their family tree we don't know their personality traits we know absolutely nothing about them except their false teaching which we've already studied and then this one remarkable statement they have shipwrecked their faith and then look at verse 20 and this is astounding this is alarming Hymenaeus and Alexander whom I have delivered over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blasphemy these men have been delivered over
[time=2714] to Satan what does that mean what does it mean to be delivered over to Satan what does that look like how does that happen well for the answer to that question you have to come back tonight because I'm going to tell you about that tonight I don't have time to tell you about that this morning but you come back tonight and I'll share it with you it's a fascinating concept runs all the way through the Old and the New Testament Timothy fight the good fight fight the noble fight how by holding on to your doctrine and your good conscience your good faith don't so violate the inner voice within you take your obedience to the absolute nth degree of your life never give it up never cause it shipwreck I'm thinking of a passage here the experience in the life of Paul I'll read it to you out of Acts chapter 23 it says this and Paul looking intently at the council he's before the council of the Sanhedrin said this brethren I have lived my life with a perfectly good conscience before God to this day standing in front of a bunch of Pharisees and Sadducees and listen to their reaction and the high priest ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth strike him on the mouth then Paul said to him God is going to strike you you white washed wall and do you sit to try me according to the law and in violation of the law order me to be struck amazing isn't it what's going on these men who are leading this Sanhedrin this council have given themselves over to a defiled conscience they have lived a life of absolute utter hypocrisy that's who they are by definition in fact in Matthew Jesus goes on to curse them several different times whoa to you scribes and Pharisees and each and every time it's because of the utter hypocrisy of their life because you shut off kingdoms I'm reading out of Matthew 23 kingdoms from the heaven from heaven and from men in other words you're offering salvation but you actually shut the kingdom off to them what do you scribes and Pharisees because you devour widows houses even while for pretense you make long prayers what do you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte and when he becomes one you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves in other words they were evangelistic and in their evangelism saying we'll convert you to Judaism and you'll find life but in reality he's twice as much a son of hell as you are yourself your blind guides he says over and over again he just condemns them for their hypocrisy you tithe men and dill and cumin and have neglected the weight of your provisions of the law justice and mercy and faithfulness in other words they'll follow the small parts of the law but when it comes to the weightier matters of justice and mercy and faithfulness they have absolutely no regard for you clean the outside of the cup of the dish but inside you are full of robbery and self indulgence for you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites for you are like whitewashed which on the outside appear beautiful but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. What do you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous but how he says shall you escape the sentence of hell so in his own life Paul bears witness before the Sanhedrin I have lived with a perfectly good conscience not only do I call Timothy to that but that has been my practice I long to live and this man so incensed by that very reality that a man should sow dare to live according to his conscience that he orders the man struck and Paul immediately retorts God is going to strike you you whitewashed wall unbelievable. Paul is zealous for the conscience Paul is zealous for obedience and that's really what the conscience is the conscience is the device that God has given to you and he has given to me to apply the general truth of scripture to the everyday moment of our life to the everyday circumstance and we cannot violate it we cannot overrule it we cannot shun it for in so doing we bring ourselves to the point of shipwreck
[time=3014] I was thinking this week of a man who is somewhat familiar to all of us by virtue of recent calamity captain joseph hazelwood captain joseph hazelwood who was commanding a big ship with a lot of oil and a local pilot steered the tanker out of the port of Valdez once he had departed from the ship hazelwood left the bridge went to his cabin while the vessel was still moving through the jagged shores of Prince William sound. Before he left to go to his cabin he turned the ship over to a third mate who was not even licensed by the coast guard to pilot a ship and as you know it was not too many hours after that or minutes after that shortly after midnight the tanker impaled itself on a reef and its hull was torn by gaseous some 15 feet wide millions and millions in excess of 10 million gallons poured out and began to destroy some of the most beautiful scenery of these great United States shipwreck devastation it appears however that the real shipwreck in his life had occurred long before the one we all learned about it was alleged in the article that I read that in a five-year span his automobile driver's license had been revoked three times three times in a five-year span because of drunk driving when his blood was tested fully nine hours after the ship had run aground he had blood alcohol level of .06 excuse me a .06 higher than the .04 the coast guard considers acceptable for the ship captain assuming he drank nothing after the accident and his body metabolized at the normal rate has a woods level at the time of the accident was about .19 almost double the amount that causes a motorist to be judged and you know persecuted for drunk driving it's a long story isn't it in his life I mean just briefly you can see somewhere back there he began to shut off the voice of conscience somewhere back there he became comfortable with the idea of drinking while under the influence with total disregard to the devastation and destruction he would bring on a family such as mine driving down the road the opposite direction when he swerved across the line and killed us all somewhere along the line he said no to his conscience
[time=3180] even as a potentially unregenerate man who only had the law capital L written upon his heart the shipwreck began in small little ways somewhere back there and finally it happened in the broadest sense possible in the natural realm and the whole world read about it and saw it where are you in the process of shipwreck and I want to call you this morning to obey your conscience I want to be an encourager to you this morning to obey your conscience with your taxes with your wife with your kids with your employer with every aspect of your life God has given it to you as a rudder to navigate your life in the spiritual sense it is utter folly and foolishness to disregard it instead treasure it, honor it revere it, obey it and resound to the praise and the glory of our great God would you stand with me for a closing word of prayer Father we would think of a man like Captain John Hazelwood
[time=3260] and our heart is not full of anger but sympathy for him his life proves such a devastating example somehow learning to say no to the conscience and Lord we think of Hymenaeus and Alexander and how they had done the same thing only in a spiritual sense with the gospel itself as shepherds as men who were standing there proclaiming the way to truth and somehow someway they worked themselves to a place that it was okay to preach the wrong gospel and father we know ourselves we know our hearts we know how susceptible we are to hear the voice of conscience and to somehow rationalize around it father call us to absolute strict obedience and we want to love you we want to express that love through our obedience
[time=3314] and you've given us this rutter so to speak that we might do that in every area of our life the praise of you and we love you in your name Jesus amen well it's a strong word from the Bible the one tonight is even stronger I really want you to come back if you can and listen to what it means to be delivered over to Satan we hear so little about it what we do here most often is wrong about the role of Satan in all this we always take time to allow you to respond to the word of God what he's been doing in your life and maybe you've come to the Lord in the last week or two maybe you need to come forward for baptism in obedience to obey your conscience which would call you to obedience even though it's public and it's maybe embarrassing or difficult to stand up in front of everybody to come forward for baptism maybe you're ready to join our church you've been attending for a while and you're thinking yeah this is where God wants me to be and I'm ready to join the church or maybe you
