[time=0] Money matters. It matters a lot. An article I read just the other day indicated that we
[time=7] spend about 50% of our time thinking about money. How to earn more money, how to save money, how we spend our money. I think that article is probably right, at least it seems that way in my life. Stay with us this morning as we study God's word and learn from it vital relevant principles as to how we should use and make and spend our money.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=43] you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Over the years, Black
[time=49] Hawk has been richly blessed by God and has enjoyed a pattern of continued growth throughout its 22 years of ministry. As we look forward to a new building program, we as a church and as individuals must decide how we will meet the financial challenges. What does the
[time=65] Bible say about how we use, make and spend our money? Today, Pastor Moore is beginning
[time=71] a series of four messages on biblical stewardship. Today, we will be looking at giving in the
[time=77] Old Testament. Please have your Bibles open and ready as we move through the Old Testament.
[time=83] We are excited today to have as our special guest, Mr. Bruce Greer. Bruce will be featured
[time=89] with our sanctuary choir and orchestra in a number he wrote especially for the dedication of our new sanctuary three years ago. It is entitled, "The Lord Rains." He and our own
[time=100] Scott Schindler also team up on the dual grand pianos to play the familiar, joyful, joyful.
[time=107] As we prepare for our time of worship, let's listen to the sanctuary choir and orchestra as they share the musical piece entitled, "Delight in the Lord."
[time=142] [MUSIC]
[time=172] "Delight in the Lord, and He will give you all the resources of your heart."
[time=188] "Delight in the Lord, And trust in Him that He will bring you to Christ, Delight in the Lord."
[time=205] [MUSIC]
[time=228] "For the Lord upholds the righteous, He knows all of their days, and they shall live there before ever."
[time=243] [MUSIC]
[time=266] "Delight in the Lord, and He will give you all the resources of your heart."
[time=277] "Delight in the Lord, and trust in Him that He will bring you to Christ, Delight in the Lord."
[time=291] "Delight in the Lord, and He will give you all the resources of your heart."
[time=303] [APPLAUSE]
[time=309] Hallelujah, hallelujah, sing it with me. Hallelujah!
[time=322] Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I will praise Him.
[time=341] I will praise Him. I will praise Him. I will praise Him. I will praise Him. I will praise Him.
[time=364] I will praise Him. I will praise Him.
[time=375] [MUSIC - 237 seconds]
[time=625] [APPLAUSE]
[time=632] Hello, and thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. We are just delighted to have Bruce Greer with us today. He was with us a couple years ago and just as a marvelous testimony and song. And we're delighted that he's here today. And we'll have some more music from him in a few minutes.
[time=648] Russell, this is a great weekend for you. You went to a ballgame. You have your parents here. That's really neat.
[time=654] That's right, Peter. My folks came in from California. We drove then up to Chicago and spent Friday night there with a whole bunch of people from USC who had flown in for the USC Notre Dame game. And unfortunately USC lost, but it's a fantastic place with tremendous tradition there at Notre Dame. We enjoyed the day a whole bunch. Had a great time.
[time=674] I know that you're going to have a good time with your folks as they stay here for a week. And that's really neat and encouraging for you and Heidi that they can come to Indiana and visit with you. We're glad they're here.
[time=684] I want to tell you just a little bit about an event coming up on November 3rd. If you're watching right now, take the time to set aside that evening for the life action singers who will be with us. And their theme that night will be the family holding on for life.
[time=702] They'll be here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 6 p.m. I hope that you'll join with us for that evening of music and spiritual enrichment as it relates to the family on Sunday evening November 3rd.
[time=716] And Russ, as we mentioned last week, we're in the throes of a heavy building program and you're going to begin some messages on stewardship. How does that really relate to us building and how does that relate even to people that are watching?
[time=728] Well, I'm amazed at how vital a litmus test, if you will, or an indicator of spirituality that our money is.
[time=738] We worship a God who is spirit. We can't see him. We can't touch him. We can't handle him. But we can handle and touch his money.
[time=746] And he's very interested in what we do with it and how we spend it. And it's a tremendous indicator as to what's going on in our heart with this God who we can't touch and can't see.
[time=756] So I think it's going to be a challenging series of messages to my own heart and I'm looking forward to being influenced by what the Word of God has to say about it.
[time=764] And I'm hopeful it's helpful for our church family and for our viewing audience.
[time=768] For those of you that are watching and if you have a regular church home, I hope that you'll take these messages to heart and you will have a deep desire to support your own local church as it relates to your giving in a monetary way.
[time=782] And we'd like to take a moment now to remind you of the gift offer for this month.
[time=786] It's entitled "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis. One of the chapters in there, the first one is entitled "The Case for Christianity."
[time=794] And if you want to understand very clearly what it means to be a Christian from really kind of an academic point of view, this is a great book.
[time=802] And I hope that you'll send for today. This is the last time we'll be offering it on the Bible hour.
[time=807] And you can receive it today by simply writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=817] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=827] Russell, we've had some tremendous music from the orchestra and choir and Bruce Greer. And we're going to go back to the live portion of our service now.
[time=834] And to hear Bruce and Scott Schinder, our own Scott play with the orchestra, it'll be a great time of ministry.
[time=841] And then we'll have the message from God's word from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=857] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=1068] [APPLAUSE - 8 seconds]
[time=1090] [AMEN]
[time=1092] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1100] Praise the Lord, amen?
[time=1102] [AMEN] Well, as we continue to worship this morning, let me invite you to stand and greet those around you in the name of the Lord.
[time=1133] Well, it's a tremendous morning to be in the house of the Lord, to know the Savior, and to share in the celebration of His great love for us.
[time=1147] Well, this morning I'd like to begin a series on giving, on financial stewardship.
[time=1155] And I have been giving this some thought the last several weeks, wondering how I feel about starting a series on giving.
[time=1163] Maybe it'll be two, three, or four weeks.
[time=1165] And to be frank with you, I'm quite comfortable with the notion.
[time=1169] And I want to tell you why.
[time=1171] It's because we don't have what I call the two deadly deeds, the two deadly deeds of church leadership with respect to finances.
[time=1180] The first is called desperation.
[time=1183] We have no sense of desperation for funds here.
[time=1186] If you take your bulletin out for a minute again and look towards the back where we report to you every week our financial summary, October 20, 1991.
[time=1197] As you probably watch this from week to week, you'll notice that the year to date, the bottom little figure there, we're about $62,000 behind on our budget to date.
[time=1210] And yet, in thinking about that myself and doing a little bit of research, and some of you who have been here longer than I will know this better than I, but that's not uncommon.
[time=1220] 1989, October, this time two years ago, we were $57,000 behind at this point, and we finished in the black.
[time=1229] Last year, 1990, in October, we were $78,000 behind, and we again finished in the black, and I think that's a combination of two things.
[time=1239] One, because we don't spend everything just because it's budgeted, so we'll underspend our budget.
[time=1245] And secondly, because this church and friends of this church are in a pattern of year in giving, which is fine.
[time=1251] Some of you will come to the end of the year and know better where you are and make an extra above and beyond type of gift.
[time=1257] And I think because of those two factors, we have consistently finished in the black, even though about now we're running behind.
[time=1264] And I don't know of any reason that that should change.
[time=1267] So what I'm trying to say to you is I'm not going to speak now on giving for the next few weeks because I have some earnest sense of desperation.
[time=1274] Like sometimes you'll hear in appeals for money, whether it be in a church or in a parrot church, whereby people are saying, you know, if you don't give X amount of dollars by such and such a time, we're out of business.
[time=1287] That's not what we're saying here. That's not what this series is about.
[time=1292] Secondly, the second deadly D is that of demandingness.
[time=1297] And I don't sense any of that either.
[time=1300] A lot of times when you get involved in a capital funds drive in a Christian organization or a church, there will be a real sense of this has got to happen.
[time=1308] This is a do or a die. We have to make this thing come around. We've got to complete this.
[time=1314] And I don't sense that. I've been in every building committee meeting since they began as we've reorganized and moved ahead since my coming.
[time=1321] I've been in every architectural building committee side and also the fundraising side and every elders meeting and every staff meeting.
[time=1328] And not in any of those meetings. Have I sensed that attitude?
[time=1332] Have I sensed an attitude of we are going to do this whether anybody likes it or not? We've got to do this.
[time=1337] This will happen. This has to happen. We've got to do this.
[time=1341] Instead, I've sensed a tremendous spiritual tone in the leadership of our church saying we'd like to do this.
[time=1349] We think we ought to do this. We think it's time to do this.
[time=1353] There's a real sense of waiting on the Lord in your leadership for this project.
[time=1358] And I'm thrilled by that. I'm thankful for that.
[time=1360] And that's the kind of thing that gives me the peace to stand up here and talk about giving for the next three or four weeks.
[time=1366] I do believe the space is needed. We mentioned Awana by way of an announcement already.
[time=1371] And you know more kids could and would come to Awana if we had the space.
[time=1375] We're simply maxed out on the north side of our campus. We just can't take any more people.
[time=1380] And that's great. That's wonderful. Praise the Lord.
[time=1383] And it's also an opportunity to build more space.
[time=1387] Our Sunday school program is in some cases the same way. Not in every case.
[time=1391] Not all of our ABS are full and over capacity, but some are.
[time=1396] And some of our Sunday school programs for our kids are too crowded.
[time=1400] We have too many kids in the room. More than we should have in the room. We don't have any other rooms to put them in.
[time=1404] So I don't sense there a real demandingness.
[time=1408] I mean we could make some changes. I don't know what those are.
[time=1411] But I know that we're not coming to you saying we have to do this.
[time=1415] The leadership is coming saying there is reason to do this. It seems obvious we should do this.
[time=1419] And we're waiting on the Lord with you and your confirmation as you participate in all of this.
[time=1424] And of course we have need by virtue of our Christian school.
[time=1427] And this has been a ministry of Black Hawk Baptist Church almost since its beginning.
[time=1431] I think it's been 19 years that the school has been a part of our church and the Lord has wonderfully blessed it.
[time=1437] It has taken some strides in the last 10, 12, 13 years as I understand that really leave us with a tremendous Christian education
[time=1446] and a strong environment with strong academics and all the rest.
[time=1451] And we are at a place of, in that sense, being beyond our space.
[time=1456] We're in a process of double tracking. I believe we've gone now. Double tracking meaning two grades, two kindergarten's, two first grades, two second grades.
[time=1463] I think we're up to fourth grade and our intention is to move all the way through until we're finished with high school in a double track.
[time=1469] And every time you do that, every year we use up an extra room.
[time=1474] And so we've been doing that now for a number of years and we're out of rooms.
[time=1477] And I think we've pulled about the last rabbit out of the hat, if you will, on the north side of the campus.
[time=1483] Maybe one more in there, we're not sure. We definitely have a need.
[time=1488] But knowing that need, it is in no way, in the meetings that I've been a part of with the leadership,
[time=1494] risen to a level of demandingness. And I frankly think that would be sinned.
[time=1497] I think the way that a leadership leads is just as ours is doing it. They look down the road, they understand the situation,
[time=1503] they put together a plan as best as they can and they present it to the family and they watch and see what God does.
[time=1508] And that's what this is all about. And I'm thrilled to be a part of that process.
[time=1512] So I'm ready to take a break, even from Timothy 1 Timothy.
[time=1517] We finished that chapter last Sunday and we'll spend some time on giving and then return back to 1 Timothy 2.
[time=1524] Some of you are new to the Lord, some of you are new to our church, and maybe you've never had instruction as to giving.
[time=1531] Maybe you've never really been taught what the Word of God has to say about giving, and this will be an opportunity for you to learn.
[time=1538] I'm also comfortable teaching about giving because the Bible is so full of instruction on that very topic.
[time=1545] The Bible is not silent about money and about how we're to handle our money and earn our money and steward our money
[time=1551] and invest our money and save our money. There's lots and lots and lots of information.
[time=1556] In fact, how we handle our money ranks right up there a 1 and 2 with another indicator of our spiritual growth and maturity, and that would be our tongue.
[time=1568] The Bible clearly sets out money and our tongue as probably the two most dramatic ways for us and for others to evaluate
[time=1576] what is a subjective immaterial walk with a God who is very real but cannot be touched or seen or held or handled.
[time=1584] In other words, how do I take this thing that resides in my heart called my love for God and evaluate it?
[time=1590] Well, there are lots of ways. Two of the most clearly presented are your tongue, what you do with your mouth and what you do with your money.
[time=1597] James 3.2 says, "If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man able to bridle the whole body as well."
[time=1604] In other words, if he can get ahold of that one thing in his mouth, if he can control that for the glory of God, you can be assured he controls every other aspect of his life.
[time=1613] He's a perfect man, mature. It is a tremendous litmus test or indicator, if you will, of spirituality. The same is true of money.
[time=1622] The same is true of money. Matthew 6 says, "No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or will hold to one and despise the other.
[time=1631] You cannot serve God and Mammon or money." That's because both what you do with your money and you do with your mouth come out of your heart.
[time=1640] It both comes right from your heart, and that, of course, is ultimately what God is concerned about, the condition of your heart.
[time=1647] I personally am looking forward to the series because I want to be refreshed in my understanding and my obedience to what the Word of God has to say about money.
[time=1656] I'm susceptible, as any, maybe more as to what I do with my money and how I spend it and where I choose to put it.
[time=1662] So I look forward to that in my own life as well. We are all susceptible to the great American way, buying things you don't need with money you don't have from people you don't even like.
[time=1673] It's going to become our way. Buying things we don't need with money we don't have from people we don't like and sinking every day a little bit further into a weird kind of theology called pan, pan-millennialism.
[time=1684] Which is I buy this now I have no idea where the money is coming from but I figured it will all pan out in the end. God will be good.
[time=1691] We live in a day and an age where that is replete and we need to be called. I need to be called. You need to be called.
[time=1698] Back to a clear, concise understanding of what God has to say about money. That's really what this is all about.
[time=1705] I want to spend the remainder of our morning talking about giving from the Old Testament. We won't even look at the New Testament today.
[time=1713] Let's just start with the Old Testament and try to understand giving in the Old Testament. What about the tithe? What about the free will offerings?
[time=1720] What were the first fruit offerings? How did all that work? And hopefully gain an understanding of that this Lord's Day and come back next Lord's Day and talk about New Testament giving and compare and contrast and see what we can learn as to how God would have us use our money.
[time=1734] The Old Testament has two basic types of giving. They come under different names and it can be confusing but there are basically two kinds of giving taught in the Old Testament.
[time=1746] One is required giving. Two is free will giving. All the giving that you see in the Old Testament will come under one of those two headings, either required giving or free will giving.
[time=1758] Let's begin by looking at the required giving. We're going to do a series of touch and goes this morning if you will. My dad was a pilot and I used to watch him practice.
[time=1769] What it required was for him to touch down and then he'd take right off. He wouldn't park the plane and get out. He'd just kind of touch down and then hit the gas and go around again and do it again and again.
[time=1778] You never really land. You just touch down. We're going to do that with a bunch of scriptures today. If I irritate you with that, take notes.
[time=1785] All right, take notes. And I really want you to leave this morning with a clear understanding of the Old Testament pattern for giving. That's really my objective.
[time=1796] Genesis chapter 41, we begin looking at the idea of required giving. And this really even happens outside the context of the nation of Israel or the covenant people.
[time=1808] You remember Joseph. Joseph is now the number two man in charge of all of Egypt and Pharaoh has had a dream about seven years of plenty and seven years of famine.
[time=1817] And the Lord reveals that they shall tax the people 20%. It is required giving. Genesis 41 verse 34.
[time=1826] Let Pharaoh take action to a point overseers in charge of the land and let him exact a fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.
[time=1836] So each year, take from the people 20%, put it in storage so that when you come to the seven years of famine and drought, you can have what you need to supply the needs of all the people.
[time=1847] And that was what was going on financially. And we all understand that what God was doing was preparing the way for the promised people to come into the land of Egypt and there be birthed by a supernatural growth rate where they would eventually come out of the other side of that in the Exodus and be the nation of Israel.
[time=1861] But on a purely monetary basis, through this famine, God brought the first required giving. This is the first IRS. This is the first federal income tax, if you will, and to think our God brought it upon them.
[time=1875] The second required giving, I want you to come now to Leviticus chapter 27. Leviticus chapter 27 verse 30.
[time=1886] And here we come to a discussion of the tithe, which just means 10%. It is not really a spiritual word, it is more a mathematical word, and it means 10% a tithe.
[time=1899] Now, when we come to the book of Leviticus, I want you to understand something. We've now entered Mosaic Law. In both of these discussions on required giving and free will giving, we will talk about that prior to the Mosaic Law and then after Mosaic Law.
[time=1914] And once we enter Mosaic Law, that carried on through the end of their history. We are now in Leviticus, and so now Moses has given the law, and this is the way the nation was supposed to run year after year after year.
[time=1926] And there are three tithes, three different tithes that are revealed to us. Leviticus chapter 27 verse 30.
[time=1936] It says there, "Thus all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree is the Lord's." It is holy to the Lord.
[time=1950] This was called the Lord's tithe, or the tithe of the Levite, because according to Numbers 18, it was then given to the Levites so that they could have a living.
[time=1961] You remember the Levites were not given an inheritance in the land. They were one of the twelve tribes, and it was their job to minister in the temple the theocracy of God in the nation of Israel.
[time=1972] What is a theocracy? A theocracy is the form of government that these people followed. Theo, God, God was their government. They were led directly by God.
[time=1980] And his administrators, if you were, were these Levites. And in order to support their government, the nation of Israel was to take a tenth of their annual income as it is described here and give it to the Lord, the Lord's tithe, which was then given to the Levites.
[time=1997] It was really a form of taxation. It was really a form of supporting their government. The second tithe is in Deuteronomy chapter 12. This tithe, if you'll go there with me, is called the festival tithe, the festival tithe.
[time=2014] And it was designed to support the national camaraderie. It was really a national potluck, and it happened once a year, and the people would bring all of their food often to Jerusalem, and they would celebrate the goodness of God, and it was a cultural, social reinforcement of values around the worship of Yahweh. Deuteronomy 12 verses 10 and 11.
[time=2037] When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the Lord your God is giving you to inherit, and he gives you the rest, excuse me, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security.
[time=2049] Verse 11, "Then it shall come about that the place in which the Lord your God shall choose for his name to dwell, there you shall bring all that I command you, your bird offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the contribution of your hand, and all your choice, votive offerings.
[time=2066] You will vow to the Lord." We see here the festival tithe, taken to Jerusalem, eaten by family, friends, servants, and priests in the sanctuary.
[time=2080] It was to stimulate, as I have said, the national identity, the social identity, the sense of camaraderie and love and mutual sharing.
[time=2089] All right, the Lord's tithe, 10% a year. The festival tithe, another 10%, that brings us to 20%. That too was a tax.
[time=2098] It was not a free will. It was not optional. It was another form of supporting the government, if you will. It was a tax.
[time=2106] The third tithe is in Deuteronomy, chapter 14, just over a few pages, verse 28. This tithe is called the poor tithe. It was given as a welfare system.
[time=2119] And you know there were other welfare systems in place, the year of Jubilee and other such things where debts were forgiven, but this is every third year this tithe would be taken as a basis of welfare and caring for the poor.
[time=2132] Deuteronomy 14, 28. At the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year and you shall deposit it in your own town.
[time=2142] Why? Verse 29. And the Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance among you, and the alien, the orphan and the widow who are in your town, shall come and eat and be satisfied in order that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
[time=2157] So there you have it. That is a brief summary of all of the required giving in the Old Testament. It began there with Joseph for a national reason.
[time=2167] And then as we moved past and into the Mosaic Law, we come to the reality of three basic tithes, the Lord's tithe, ten percent, the festival tithe, ten percent, and the poor tithe, ten percent every three years.
[time=2182] So you come up with a figure of about twenty-three and a third percent on an annual basis.
[time=2187] It should not be considered their free will giving because it wasn't. It was a form of taxation.
[time=2195] Now, above and beyond that comes our second category called free will giving, entirely different.
[time=2205] And to look at the first free will offering in the Old Testament, come with me to Genesis chapter 4.
[time=2214] This giving is most notable for the murder associated with it. This is Cain and Abel.
[time=2222] What is interesting here is that there is no indication that the Lord ever required this giving, never suggested it. They did it. They just chose to come and give to the Lord.
[time=2233] Verses three and four of chapter four. So it came about in the course of time that Cain brought an offering to the Lord of the fruit of the ground.
[time=2241] And Abel on his part also brought up the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and for his offering.
[time=2250] But for Cain and for his offering he had no regard, so Cain became very angry at his countenance fell.
[time=2257] Now there is the discussion as to why one was acceptable and the other wasn't.
[time=2261] And I don't know that I land anywhere. There are two basic options. I don't know that it really matters.
[time=2266] What's important is that Cain's wasn't acceptable, but some suggest that Cain's was not acceptable because it was of the ground. It was of the fruit. It was not of the shed blood of some animal.
[time=2277] And they'll suggest that was what made it unacceptable. That may be the case.
[time=2281] I have a little trouble landing there because in Leviticus 2 many grain offerings are described as perfectly acceptable.
[time=2288] As we move on into the Mosaic Law it becomes very clear that every sacrifice didn't have to be shed blood of an animal to be acceptable. So I get a little confused. I'm not sure which.
[time=2298] The point is this. This is the first free will offering in the Bible. And there was no amount specified. There was no percentage specified.
[time=2308] There were no requirements, no date of delivery, nothing. It just came out of their hearts and they gave.
[time=2316] The second one is Noah. Genesis 8, verse 20.
[time=2324] Here we find the second free will offering if you will.
[time=2330] Genesis 8, verse 20. As you know, Noah has just come out of the flood out of the ark. He's been through this unbelievable event in world history.
[time=2339] And he makes an altar and offers an offering. Verse 20, then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird and offered bird offerings on the altar.
[time=2350] And the Lord smelled the soothing aroma and the Lord said to himself, "I will never again curse the ground on the count of man."
[time=2356] So again, no stipulation as to percentage, no stipulation as to amount, no stipulation as to some format, just a free will offering from his heart.
[time=2368] The next one you'll find is in Genesis chapter 12 and it involves Abram. Genesis chapter 12, verse 7.
[time=2378] Abram has just received what we call the Abrahamic Covenant in verses 1, 2, and 3 of chapter 12. From your loins, you will be a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great.
[time=2390] And in response to that in verse 7, the Lord appeared to Abram and said to your descendants, "I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him, another free will offering.
[time=2404] He did it again over in verse 18 of chapter 13, the last verse of chapter 13. Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamr, which are in Hebron and there he built an altar to the Lord.
[time=2420] No stipulation, no percentage, no amount, no particular way, just a free will offering in response to the goodness of God.
[time=2430] So there you have the first few examples of this non-compulsory free will giving. The next two use the word tenth or tithe.
[time=2442] And I don't want you to get confused now. You're still pre-Mosaic law. You're still in the book of Genesis.
[time=2448] But the word tenth comes up twice. Come look at it with me. Genesis chapter 14 verses 18 and 20, or 18 through 20. This is Abram again and he runs into Melchizedek, king of Salem, who Hebrews tells us was also a priest.
[time=2468] And the king brought out bread in verse 18 and wine. Now he was a priest of God most high, and he blessed him and said, "Blessed be Abram of God most high, possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed be God most high, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." And he gave him a tenth of all he had.
[time=2486] That that incident is recorded for us in Hebrews 7. And it says that the tenth that Abram gave was of the very best of all of his spoils.
[time=2496] He had just won a huge battle in retrieving a lot. Lot had been taken captive. And in the process Abraham had wiped out several kingdoms and taken all the spoil for himself.
[time=2506] And it was a massive thing. And when he came and saw Melchizedek, who he would have understood to be a representative of God himself and out of his heart, out of thanksgiving that Lot had been given back to him and all this added wealth, he took from all the spoils the very best and from that 10% of it and gave it to Melchizedek.
[time=2525] So the word tenth, or your Bible may say tithe, I don't know, was given, but it was not to be confused or is not to be confused with the tithing of Mosaic Law, which was in reality a tax, not a free will giving.
[time=2538] The second place you find it is in connection with Jacob, Genesis 28, verses 20 through 22. Jacob is making a free will offering and the word tithe or tenth comes into the discussion, again not as a tax, but as a free will offering.
[time=2560] And here our good friend Jacob, who was so known to struggle with his relationship with God, is trying to bribe God. He is saying, Lord, if I give you this, will you give me success?
[time=2572] Verses 20 and following. Then Jacob made a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take and will give me food to eat and garments to wear and I return to my father's house in safety, then the Lord will be my God.
[time=2586] And this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God's house and of all that thou dost give me, I will surely give a tenth to thee.
[time=2595] So again, free will, not a tax, not required, he just settles on this idea of a tenth. You say, where'd that come from?
[time=2602] Mosaic Law hasn't been written. Why do Abram and Jacob stumble onto the notion of a tenth?
[time=2610] Well, as best as I can figure out, it is because of the numbering system, even of the ancient world, having been based on the number ten, ten fingers, ten toes.
[time=2620] So the numbering system would grow out of that idea of ten, and it was customary in the worship of pagan gods of that day to give a tenth as a symbol of the whole thing.
[time=2633] We are based on the number ten, and we will give a tenth as a representative symbol of our whole system, in other words, of all that we have and all that we are, and we would give a tenth to our pagan deity and worship him there.
[time=2645] It is likely that they got the notion at first of a tenth from their pagan neighbors and would have done the same.
[time=2656] So we have required giving, a tithe, a tithe, and a third of a tithe. The Lord's tithe, the festival tithe, and the poor tithe, required giving.
[time=2668] Then we have free will giving, and we see it in the life of these men. We see it in the life of Cain and Abel, of Noah, of Abraham and of Jacob.
[time=2678] But now we come to the end of that period of history and enter into the Mosaic Law, the era when this tithing thing had already been put in place.
[time=2686] And you say to yourself, "Do they still have free will giving there?" The answer is yes. Numbers chapter 18.
[time=2695] Numbers chapter 18 verse 12. Running concurrent with the tithing taxation of Mosaic Law is a free will offering system.
[time=2709] And it comes here under the title of First Fruits, which is a very interesting concept.
[time=2715] Numbers chapter 18 verse 12 describes such a free will offering.
[time=2721] All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the fresh wine and of the grain, the first fruits of those which they give to the Lord, I give them to you.
[time=2733] And if you were to track the notion of first fruits giving in the Old Testament, it goes something like this.
[time=2738] As you know, these people weren't giving money. They were giving oil, and they were giving wine and grain.
[time=2745] They were principally an agrarian community and dealt in some gold and silver, but mainly dealt in the produce of their land.
[time=2754] And what they would do at the beginning of the season when the crop was just beginning to yield, they would take the first fruits and they'd take the best of that.
[time=2763] And they had no idea what the rest of the season would bring. They had no idea what their grand total would be.
[time=2769] They divide up by a certain number and say, "We'll give this to the Lord." All they know is, "Here are my first fruits."
[time=2775] And I will give of the best of my first fruits without knowing what remains to the Lord.
[time=2780] You say, "How come they did it that way?" They did it that way because they were in a covenant relationship with God, which said this.
[time=2790] If you obey me, and if you love me, and if you honor me, I will bless you not only spiritually, but what?
[time=2797] Circumstantially. I will make your crops increase. I will make your herds multiply.
[time=2803] And we know that he was doing that with the nation of Israel so that all the nations of the world would look at this unique nation with their unique relationship to a living God and say, "You guys have the right God."
[time=2814] And so the Lord set them up in a circumstantial blessing in the covenant. And if you keep my commands and obey my words, I'll bless you.
[time=2821] And what he meant by that was, "I'll not only bless you in your heart, I'll bless you in everything you own." So when a man as a head of a household in the nation of Israel would take his first fruits, it was a tremendous affirmation of his faith in God and his faith in the covenant that that great and awesome God will indeed do what he said he would do.
[time=2839] Without knowing how I will care for myself and for my future and for my family, without knowing the rest of the produce, I pick off the best and I give it to you as an expression of faith and love that you are the covenant keeping God and that you will do what you have said.
[time=2854] Tremendous act of faith.
[time=2857] That's why the scripture over and over talks about that kind of thing. Let me read a few scriptures.
[time=2861] Proverbs 3-9, "Honor the Lord from your wealth and from the first of all your produce so your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will overflow with new wine."
[time=2875] That's the same truth taught. Proverbs 11-24, listen to how this one is described.
[time=2881] There is one who scatters, yet increases all the more. There is one who withholds what is justly due, but it results only in want.
[time=2892] In other words, the more he withholds, the more he needs because God takes his hand of blessing off the individual.
[time=2898] The verse goes on, "The generous man will be prosperous. He who waters will himself be watered."
[time=2906] That is all a reflection of the old covenant circumstantial blessing system, saying, "If you will just freely scatter as an act of love, as an act of faith, as an act in trust that I can deliver and care for your needs circumstantially, then I will bless you beyond your wildest dreams."
[time=2922] If you withhold as an expression of a lack of faith and a lack of trust and a lack of willingness to be a part of what I am doing in redemptive history, then you'll find yourself wanting.
[time=2936] The first fruit's offering was an act of faith in the covenant relationship of the Old Testament.
[time=2941] We honor, love, and obey you, and you will bless us not only spiritually, but circumstantially.
[time=2950] So God gave them that, first fruits, as a tangible way to take their very livelihood and put it on the line and say, "God, I believe in you. I believe you'll provide. I believe you'll take care of me."
[time=2964] There's another kind of offering called the free will offering.
[time=2967] Come back now with me to Exodus, chapter 25.
[time=2975] Exodus, chapter 25, verses 1 and 2.
[time=2986] They are calling for the institution of the tabernacle. They need the materials to make the tabernacle.
[time=2995] Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, "Tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution for me from every man whose heart moves him, you shall raise my contribution."
[time=3006] And here comes the theme of the free will giving of the Old Testament, whether it be first fruit or here, just the free will giving.
[time=3014] It is the heart. God never stipulated the amount or the time or the place or the way.
[time=3022] He basically only stipulated that it come from your heart, that it come from your heart.
[time=3029] If you want to see how many people's hearts got touched in this giving program, come with me to Exodus, chapter 36, 35 and 36.
[time=3040] Over and over again, the emphasis is on the heart.
[time=3047] Chapter 35, let's jump through a couple of verses here. Verse 5, "Take from among you a contribution to the Lord, whoever is of a willing..."
[time=3056] What? Heart. Look at verse 21, "And everyone whose heart stirred him, and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the Lord's contribution."
[time=3069] Verse 22, "Then all whose hearts moved them, both men, women, came and brought the various things."
[time=3077] Verse 26, "And all the women whose hearts stirred with skill."
[time=3084] Verse 29, "The Israelites, all the men and women whose heart moved them to bring material..."
[time=3091] Over and over and over again, it's the people whose hearts were touched, and they gave of this free will offering.
[time=3097] Now look at chapter 36, verses 5 and following. Find out what happened.
[time=3102] And they said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the Lord commanded us to perform."
[time=3110] So Moses issued a command and a proclamation was circulated throughout the camp saying, "Let neither man nor woman any longer perform work for the contributions of the sanctuary."
[time=3121] Thus the people were restrained from bringing anymore, for the material they had was sufficient and more than enough for all the work to perform it.
[time=3131] Now I want to be hastened to add here that I am not trying to hint or even openly say that if the people of Blackhawk will just get their hearts right, then they'll give enough and will have too much to build the next.
[time=3143] I'm not saying that. I don't think that's a fair interpretation of this text.
[time=3147] I think what we're saying here is that when we examine Old Testament giving, there was a required portion in which the amount and the time was stipulated, they were called tithes.
[time=3158] It was really a form of taxation to support their government.
[time=3162] When you move past that, you move into the free will offerings or the first fruit offerings and that is the kind of giving that is dictated out of the gratitude of the heart of the individual who determines in his own heart and his own relationship with God to give.
[time=3178] And it was a statement of tremendous faith and affirmation of a God who can provide and who can meet his promises in the covenant relationship.
[time=3188] Now come to the end of Israel's history as it's recorded by the Old Testament to Malachi.
[time=3198] Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament, we're wrapping up right now.
[time=3208] And this is where when people talk about robbing God, this is the verse that they quote, Malachi chapter three, verses seven and eight.
[time=3221] From the days of your fathers, you have turned aside from my statutes and have kept them, excuse me, and have not kept them, return to me and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts.
[time=3232] But you say, how shall we return? Now verse eight, will a man rob God yet you are robbing me?
[time=3240] But you say, how have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings?
[time=3246] And this is really a description of Israel throughout its history.
[time=3252] The particular situation here when Malachi wrote is the people have been back from their Babylonian captivity now for a hundred years.
[time=3260] They're in Jerusalem, the city has been rebuilt, the second temple has been constructed, and everything is in place so that their tithes can be given and the whole system can go on as far as the theocracy, somewhat now changed by the kings that would have been in place.
[time=3274] But nevertheless, they can support the government which God gave them, and then they can also have a way to give their free will offerings and their first fruit offerings.
[time=3285] But they have become complacent, and they have allowed their religion to turn into merely an external, and their heart is no longer vitally involved with God, and they have no gratitude, and they have no sincere desire to say thank you.
[time=3299] And all of those juices that we feel when we are especially thankful for God had dried up inside of their hearts, and they were now just going through the motions.
[time=3309] And you know what happened? The Lord eventually sent the Lord Jesus Christ as king, the book of Matthew records it, he came making a kingdom offer to these people, not these, but those who would have been their descendants offering them the kingdom, and they said no, we don't want it, we don't want you, you're of Satan.
[time=3327] He was crucified, and God turned his attention to the church. And that's what we are today.
[time=3339] Old Testament giving, two kinds, required free will, required came under the heading of tithe, three of them, 23 and a half percent on an annual basis.
[time=3352] That was the taxation, that was to uphold the government. Above and beyond that, free will giving, or first fruit's giving, which is to be called up from your heart, and there is no amount determined, there is no particular way that it should be done, or how often it should be done.
[time=3367] Simply an expression of faith in God. You say okay, that's the Old Testament. What about the New Testament? How are we supposed to give in the New Testament?
[time=3381] And I'll suggest this to you, there has been very little change. There has been very little change. You will find in the New Testament and we'll go into this in detail next week.
[time=3392] That there are two kinds of giving in the New Testament. They are required giving, and there is free will giving.
[time=3399] I hope your heart was blessed today by the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and special guest Bruce Greer.
