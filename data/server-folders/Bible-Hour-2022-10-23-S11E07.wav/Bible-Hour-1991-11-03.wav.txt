[time=0] A number of years ago, Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana began a television
[time=6] ministry.
[time=8] The Bible Hour began about 18 years ago and has been seen every week.
[time=12] We're pleased to present the Bible Hour to you today.
[time=15] About six months ago, our new pastor Russell Moore began his ministry at Black Hawk and began preaching on the Bible Hour.
[time=22] We've enjoyed his awareness of the scriptures and his practical applications of it.
[time=27] And I remember even the first Sunday that he came to preach at Black Hawk Baptist Church, totally unaware of the area of Indiana and our church.
[time=35] He spoke on anxiety and that was a great message.
[time=39] We're pleased to repeat that message today and we hope that you enjoy it.
[time=43] We thought it was a very powerful message and we want to just remind you of that first day when Russell Moore was here and we are delighted that he is our pastor and that he is continuing the ministry at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=56] You'll stay tuned today now for the message from Pastor Moore on anxiety.
[time=63] Doctors tell us that stress has become the number one medical problem in America today.
[time=69] Stay with us because we're going to be looking at some vital principles from God's Word that help us deal with anxiety.
[time=86] Welcome to an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship on the Bible Hour.
[time=92] Thank you for joining us.
[time=94] Our special guest speaker today is Russell Moore, the vice president for student affairs at the Masters College in Santa Clarita, California.
[time=101] His message today is entitled "Anxious for Nothing." His text is taken from the book of Philippians chapter 4 verses 4 through 6.
[time=111] Some music today includes a duet from Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe and a solo from Read
[time=117] the Faber.
[time=119] Let's join our service as the sanctuary choir and orchestra bring us a song entitled "God of My Praise."
[time=141] [MUSIC - 189 seconds]
[time=349] [APPLAUSE]
[time=356] May Jesus Christ continue to be praised as we sing that song "Him #87" please.
[time=362] "Him #87" you're singing well today.
[time=364] Thank you for joining with us.
[time=366] We'll sing verses 1, 3 and 6.
[time=369] [MUSIC - 85 seconds]
[time=473] We sing with our voices praise to the Lord.
[time=476] Let's listen now with our hearts as we listen to the ministry of Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rose they come to sing a very beautiful song.
[time=483] Listen to the words and join into the message of it.
[time=486] [MUSIC]
[time=502] How many snowflakes fall in valleys deep on mountains tall would I understand if I'd count them all?
[time=513] How great are his thoughts toward me?
[time=518] No human mind can know the full extent of the love God chose.
[time=525] He reached so far he stooped so low to give all his love for me.
[time=535] Oh, how much he cares for me? Oh, how great his heart must be.
[time=551] There's no number high enough to count the father's thoughts of love more than all the grains of sand
[time=562] or stars above. How much he cares for you? How much he cares for me?
[time=574] How great his love, how great his heart must be.
[time=586] My burdens great or small are his concerns he sees them all.
[time=594] Hey, since to my faintest call, how great is his love for me?
[time=602] Though millions may pray to him, still he'll answer each of them.
[time=610] The youngest child, the oldest man, are precious before his eyes.
[time=619] And oh, how much he cares for me? Oh, how great his heart must be.
[time=635] There's no number high enough to count the father's thoughts of love more than all the grains of sand
[time=646] or stars above. How much he cares for you? How much he cares for me?
[time=658] How great his love, how great his heart must be.
[time=665] Oh, how much he cares for me? Oh, how great his heart must be.
[time=682] There's no number high enough to count the father's thoughts of love more than all the grains of sand
[time=693] or stars above. How much he cares for you? How much he cares for me?
[time=705] How great his love, how great his heart must be.
[time=735] Hello and thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=740] As I mentioned in the early part of the program that we are reverting back to earlier days of the Bible Hour
[time=746] when Pastor Moore was first with us.
[time=749] We're also glad to have you here at Blackhawk and things have really changed weather wise at least
[time=755] in the six months that you've been here. We had nice warm weather in just the last couple days.
[time=759] You're beginning to get a taste of Indiana weather.
[time=762] Well, it's changed significantly and I know my wife even last night said, Russell, I'm not sure we understand how cold it's really going to get.
[time=769] Because apparently we're in the 20s about now and I guess it's going to get colder than that, isn't it?
[time=774] It's a little colder than that. I remember the first year I was here, it was 17 below zero in December
[time=780] and I thought, my, my, this is mighty cold.
[time=782] Speaking of time elapsed here, we're into November already and that's the time when we distribute living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=790] If you'd like to come to the living Christmas tree, you might set the date of November 16th.
[time=794] That's a Saturday where we open our doors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
[time=798] and you can receive as many as eight tickets per individual if you come to the worship center of the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=805] It's a great time. You can call the church or watch the newspapers for the dates of the tree.
[time=811] We'll give them to you in coming days of the television program.
[time=816] But remember November 16th, that's an important day to come and we want you to have these tickets and we want you to join with us for this great celebration.
[time=824] We're calling it celebrating Christmas joy and it'll highlight the living Christmas tree
[time=830] and we want you to come and join with us on that day.
[time=833] Well, as we talked about the fact that we're repeating of the first message and I'm sure that the title of your message is kind of indicative of the type of day.
[time=844] We were all kind of anxious for no reason, but we were a little bit anxious.
[time=848] Well, anxiety, of course, is a brooding fear over some future contingency and it was certainly a big day in the life of the Moore family as well as, I guess, in the life of Blackhawk Baptist Church as to whether or not the Lord would marry us, if you will, in ministry.
[time=862] And I'm certainly glad that he has. I know that it's been an exciting six months
[time=868] tremendous time of transition for us in every way. I don't know how it could have been any better.
[time=873] I think about my daughters and, of course, my four girls and they are so immersed in Blackhawk Christian school.
[time=881] My eldest has played on the volleyball team, has taken up the flute, you know, so she can be in the band.
[time=888] She's singing in the choir and she's faithfully doing her study.
[time=892] She loves her teacher and that's true of my other daughters.
[time=895] They're not as involved because they're a little younger, but they're really involved in the school and their minds are captivated by that, as well as all that goes on at church.
[time=904] And I know that Heidi and I miss our friends at home. I mean, that's to be expected, though.
[time=909] I think it'd be unhealthy if there weren't some emotional tearing going on there, and that's definitely happening.
[time=914] We'll talk about that together and cry a little bit and reminisce and enjoy all the good times.
[time=919] Again, I think that's healthy. I think that's normal. Pick up the phone and call home and see how everybody's doing.
[time=924] But we're very, very positive in our hearts and in our spirits about being here.
[time=930] This is where God wants us and that's clear. And it's not one of those painful things.
[time=934] I mean, there's some pain associated with it, but the overall sense is one of real joy and excitement and particularly a sense of privilege. The more we know about Blackhawk, the church, the more we learn the people,
[time=947] the more we're aware of just how good the Lord has been to bring us here.
[time=951] That's really true. Well, you know, it's really great, too, when the family members, and particularly your mom and dad while they're in California, support your ministry and God's leading to you here.
[time=961] In fact, we've gotten to know them well because of a couple visits. They're here right now, as a matter of fact.
[time=965] That's right. They've been here for about 10 or 11 days. I'll go back tomorrow morning and we went up to see the Notre Dame football game.
[time=972] They played USC, so we went to Chicago and then came back to South Bend and enjoyed that day.
[time=978] And my dad and I just returned from a little hunting trip we were on, and my dad and I have always hunted together.
[time=984] That's something we've done as early as I can remember. I've had a gun in my hand and we've been out in the field hunting, and we just had a tremendous time together this last few days.
[time=992] Now, speaking about your own family and the message today entitled "Anxious for Nothing," these are the days that we're getting into the holiday season, and certainly there are some times when people really need this message
[time=1003] and need our prayers because things get kind of tough during the holiday seasons because of all the emotions and events that take place.
[time=1010] I think that's true. I think our expectations are so high for the holidays. Thanksgiving and Christmas, and wanting family members to come back, and which family member is going to come back and which one is it, and are they going to get in some type of accident and transit and is it going to work the way we want it to?
[time=1025] And it's fertile soil for anxiety, so I hope the message is helpful reminder.
[time=1031] Speaking about families, we've chosen to start early for the Christmas edition of our gift offer for the Bible Hour.
[time=1038] This is called "Christ in Christmas, Family Advent Celebration." It's a booklet that we like to have every family have a feel right to it during the month of November.
[time=1047] You can have it during the Christmas season. It begins with the four weeks prior to Christmas and then includes Christmas Eve.
[time=1054] Activities such as reading the scriptures about the coming of Christ, putting a wreath together with candles,
[time=1060] and just remembering several weeks before Christ's birth, what this means and what this season has to do.
[time=1066] You know, we're bombarded with all of the secular events that take place.
[time=1071] Some of them good. It's neat to play in the snow and have a sleigh ride and see all the lights, but we don't want to forget the fact that we're coming close to celebrating the birth of our Savior,
[time=1081] and we want you to have this booklet. So you can receive it today by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1093] I hope you'll write for it today.
[time=1561] Thank you very much, Pete.
[time=1567] Heidi and I want you to know that this has turned out to be an unforgettable time in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=1575] I think the highlight had to be the basketball game on Friday night.
[time=1578] It was a dream come true.
[time=1579] We actually got to go to an Indiana high school basketball game.
[time=1582] We'd seen the movie "The Hoosiers" out there and didn't believe that was true.
[time=1585] Then we went and found out it was.
[time=1587] You guys are crazy.
[time=1590] Lots of fun.
[time=1591] We've just had a great, great time.
[time=1594] Will you take your Bibles with me this morning and open to the book of Philippians?
[time=1599] To what I think is probably a familiar passage to most of us.
[time=1603] Many of us have probably committed it to memory.
[time=1606] It's a favorite.
[time=1608] But I'll confess I need a good message on this this morning.
[time=1612] Philippians, chapter 4, verse 6, be anxious for nothing.
[time=1620] But in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[time=1629] As you know, Heidi and I are considering a significant transition in our lives.
[time=1633] We spent the last 12 years ministering at Grace Community Church and the Masters College and the last several at Foothill Baptist.
[time=1639] We've had a great time.
[time=1641] We grew up in sunny Southern California.
[time=1643] Both of us did.
[time=1644] And all of our family is within just a few minutes drive, maybe two hours at the most.
[time=1650] We really like where we are.
[time=1652] But the Lord is working in our hearts and it's becoming clear that what God would have me to do is to find a gracious group of people who would allow me to serve as their pastor teacher where I can focus the principal part of my life in the study and the preaching of God's Word.
[time=1668] And as a result, the transition is about and we believe it's of God.
[time=1671] We believe it's the right time.
[time=1672] We believe it's the right situation and we're just waiting for God to clearly reveal to us where that would be.
[time=1678] But I must confess in the midst of all that, I've had some sleepless nights.
[time=1683] It's tough to fall asleep and to get your mind to stop cranking through all the possible details that will impact our little family.
[time=1691] I've locked my keys in the car twice in the last seven days.
[time=1697] I've never done that before in my life.
[time=1699] I have trouble concentrating.
[time=1701] I missed several important appointments last week at the college that I'm not known for missing appointments.
[time=1706] I blew right over those things.
[time=1707] My secretary couldn't find me.
[time=1709] I was gone.
[time=1710] And then finally she found me.
[time=1711] She said, "Where were you?" and I said, "Oh, that's right.
[time=1713] We do have that meeting every week, don't we?" Unbelievable.
[time=1718] In fact, as I was studying through this message, for this message on anxiety, I ran across an article coping with anxiety, I think it was called.
[time=1725] And in the article there was a test you could take, an anxiety inventory.
[time=1729] And so I tried to take it with honesty and integrity.
[time=1732] And I scored rather high.
[time=1734] I'm ready for a good message on anxiety this morning.
[time=1739] As you look at the passage in front of you, it's really a series of verses, verses four through nine.
[time=1746] And at the center of those verses is verse six, that idea of not being anxious for anything.
[time=1753] Now, if you were reading in the Greek, something would jump off the page at you, almost as if neon lights were flashing at you.
[time=1760] And it would be the verbs in this passage.
[time=1762] They're all written in the imperative mood, imperitival verbs, and they all kind of look the same in the Greek.
[time=1769] They are as follows.
[time=1770] Let me give them to you.
[time=1771] Rejoice.
[time=1772] That's the imperative.
[time=1773] Rejoice in verse four.
[time=1775] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1777] The second imperitival verb down in verse five, let be known.
[time=1782] Let your forebearing spirit be known to all men.
[time=1787] The third, verse six, be anxious for nothing.
[time=1791] Imperitival verb is a command, by the way.
[time=1794] Also another one in verse six, be made known.
[time=1798] Let your requests imperitival verb be made known to God.
[time=1803] Number five, in verse eight, at the very end, let your mind dwell on these things.
[time=1809] And then verse nine, practice these things.
[time=1815] I don't know how many of these will get to this morning.
[time=1817] Let's see how it goes by beginning with verse four.
[time=1821] Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=1825] Now, I've heard this taught on many times, as you probably have, and we've heard some good teaching on it.
[time=1830] And the basic thrust is that we as believers can know an uncircumstantial joy.
[time=1836] Because of our relationship with Jesus Christ, we can know as a pattern in practice of life
[time=1842] an uncircumstantial joy, a joy which is unaffected by circumstances.
[time=1847] I think that's partly true.
[time=1850] But I think as you and I realize, it seems to break down when we run into a severe event or a tragic event in our lives.
[time=1857] And I mean tragic, maybe the loss of a job, maybe the death of a child, maybe the diagnosing of cancer, lethal cancer.
[time=1867] And we begin at that point after we, I guess, come out of the shock of it all.
[time=1872] There are some real serious emotions going on inside of us, the least of which we would call joy.
[time=1877] Too often it's anger and confusion.
[time=1880] And primarily those emotions are directed at our God.
[time=1885] What in the world are you doing to my life?
[time=1889] Those are real emotions.
[time=1891] And I think what tends to happen in our hearts is we begin to remember Philippians 4 and 4 and we begin to say to ourselves, I'm not supposed to feel that emotion, those emotions.
[time=1900] I'm supposed to rejoice in the Lord always, uncircumstantial.
[time=1905] It's almost as if it's one mountaintop experience after another.
[time=1909] And so we begin to try to make that verse come true in our lives.
[time=1913] And it's at that point that we are suspect to doing something very damaging and very dangerous to our relationship with Christ.
[time=1920] And it's this.
[time=1922] To try to make this verse come true, we begin to deny how we're really feeling about that unpleasant event.
[time=1929] Begin to pretend, you know, maybe I don't really feel that bad about it.
[time=1932] Try to push those feelings aside and get on this rejoice thing.
[time=1937] And it's damaging to your Christianity.
[time=1941] It's damaging to your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1944] And it's damaging to your relationships with fellow brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[time=1949] Would you turn with me to the Old Testament and let's look at an example.
[time=1953] The life of Habakkuk.
[time=1955] You're thinking where in the world is that book.
[time=1958] Habakkuk, it's in the crispy portion of the Old Testament.
[time=1961] The part you rarely get to.
[time=1967] It goes Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk.
[time=1970] Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and then the Italian prophet, Malachi.
[time=1977] Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk.
[time=1980] And look with me at chapter 3 and we will find a man who is saying in his own terminology the exact same truth we're looking at in Philippians 4.
[time=1989] He is rejoicing in the Lord.
[time=1991] Look at verse 18, chapter 3.
[time=1994] Yet I will exalt in the Lord.
[time=1997] Now exalt means to greatly rejoice.
[time=1999] It's a stronger word than the one we looked at in Philippians 4.
[time=2003] I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
[time=2007] The Lord God is my strength.
[time=2009] He has made my feet like Heinz's feet and makes me walk on high places.
[time=2013] That's a wonderful place to be in your relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2017] But I'd like you to go to chapter 1 and let's see how this man got there.
[time=2022] He's a prophet.
[time=2023] He's an Old Testament prophet and he's looking around his native Judah.
[time=2026] And he's seeing sin and he's seeing injustice and he's seeing the law of God being treated with utter disregard.
[time=2033] And where is his great God to bring vengeance and to discipline his people?
[time=2038] So he cries out in verse 2, "How long, O Lord, will I call for help?
[time=2043] And thou wilt not hear?
[time=2045] I cry out to the violence, yet thou does not save.
[time=2049] Why, dost thou make me see iniquity and cause me to look on wickedness?
[time=2053] Yes, destruction and violence are before me.
[time=2056] Strife exists and contention arises.
[time=2059] Therefore the law is ignored and justice is never upheld.
[time=2063] The wicked surround the righteous.
[time=2066] Therefore justice comes out perverted.
[time=2068] He's describing the condition in Judah.
[time=2070] And there are men in Judah who are wicked, namely the king Jehoiakim.
[time=2074] And they are not obeying the law of God.
[time=2077] And this great prophet of God doesn't understand his circumstances.
[time=2080] And he understands his God.
[time=2081] Why aren't you fixing this problem?
[time=2084] He's feeling the reality of his life and he's bringing it before God.
[time=2088] Now look at God's answer in verse 6.
[time=2090] Very confusing to Habakkuk.
[time=2092] For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans.
[time=2095] Jump down to verse 11.
[time=2097] They will sweep through like the wind and pass on.
[time=2100] The Chaldeans is another word for the Babylonians and the great king Nebuchadnezzar of the destruction of Jerusalem in 605 B.C.
[time=2108] when all those folks were deported to Babylon.
[time=2111] God says I'm going to respond to the wickedness of Judah.
[time=2114] You know how I'm going to do it?
[time=2115] I'm going to bring the Babylonians down here and wipe you guys out.
[time=2118] But that only aggravated Habakkuk situation.
[time=2121] It didn't solve his problem.
[time=2123] And he comes up with another question.
[time=2124] See it in verse 13.
[time=2127] The second part.
[time=2128] Why does thou look with favor on those who deal treacherously?
[time=2132] Why are thou silent when the wicked swallow up those more righteous than they?
[time=2138] God we're unrighteous down here in Judah and we're not obeying the law but we're not as bad as the Chaldeans.
[time=2144] What in the world how can you justify bringing in that he the nation to wipe us out?
[time=2150] And you see Habakkuk is feeling this in a serious way.
[time=2154] This is all of his life.
[time=2156] This is his culture.
[time=2157] This is his country that's going to be destroyed.
[time=2159] But I think even more significantly than that.
[time=2162] It's his job.
[time=2163] It's his professional vocation to call the people of Judah to repentance so that the invasion doesn't have to occur.
[time=2169] He's turning into a failure.
[time=2171] These are walking papers.
[time=2172] These are Habakkuk.
[time=2173] Your time is up.
[time=2174] They haven't repented.
[time=2175] And here come the Chaldeans.
[time=2176] It's like getting fired from your job.
[time=2179] And it hurts.
[time=2180] And it's exposing.
[time=2182] And it's humiliating.
[time=2183] And it makes you vulnerable.
[time=2185] There's a future contingency in this man's life that he doesn't want any part of.
[time=2190] It's the last thing in the world he wants to see but it's coming.
[time=2194] Listen to God's answer again.
[time=2196] Look at chapter 2 verse 4.
[time=2198] He says behold, as for the proud one his soul is not right within him.
[time=2205] Habakkuk you're proud.
[time=2207] Your soul is not right within you and then this classic line.
[time=2211] But the righteous will live by faith.
[time=2216] I'm finished answering your questions.
[time=2219] I'm finished having you accuse me of being foolish Habakkuk.
[time=2224] I know what Judah is doing and I know what I'm planning to do and I know that amidst all of your understanding of that
[time=2230] it drives real pain and agony into your heart as you will see the demise of your country and yourself as a professional failure
[time=2237] but my friend allow those unfavorable circumstances to drive you to me and worship me in faith.
[time=2245] Trust me.
[time=2248] You see I don't think that what God wants from us as believers in our New Testament life.
[time=2254] When the circumstances go sour and they do go sour.
[time=2258] And there are future contingencies out there that boggle our minds and mean the same for us as for Habakkuk
[time=2264] humiliation and exposure of weakness and there are some vulnerable moments in our lives.
[time=2270] The Christian solution is not to pretend it doesn't exist or to pretend it doesn't matter and that I don't really feel the impact of that.
[time=2277] I believe that Godly solution to that the way of dealing with that in a way that glorifies God and moves us on a healthy path to
[time=2284] to tasting for brief moments the reality of rejoicing in the Lord is by embracing all of the reality of the downside of that future contingency
[time=2294] and allowing that reality to drive you in dependence and faith to your great God.
[time=2301] Look again chapter 3 verse 17 he is more than aware of his circumstances.
[time=2305] He says though the fig tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines though the yield of the olive should fail
[time=2312] and the fields produce no food though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls.
[time=2318] Understand he knows exactly what's coming.
[time=2320] This is an agrarian community they're completely dependent upon the list of produce just red and it's all going to be gone.
[time=2327] Yet I will exalt in the Lord verse 18 I will rejoice in the God of my salvation verse 19 the Lord God is my strength.
[time=2336] Give me the strength to face the reality of my life not to deny it to face it and to live with purpose and godliness in the midst of it
[time=2345] and cause it to drive me to grab ahold of you my great and awesome God with the hands of faith.
[time=2351] Rejoice in the Lord always. Let's go back to Philippians 4 Philippians chapter 4 and look at verse 5.
[time=2363] If you thought that one was hard to do and we both know it is wait till you hear what he's asking of us in verse 5.
[time=2371] We're supposed to evidence of forbearing spirit do you see it let your forbearing spirit be known to all men the Lord is near.
[time=2379] Now forbearing spirit is no word we typically use in our day-to-day conversation.
[time=2383] It has to do with our rights as human beings our rights as Christians our rights as family members our rights as citizens
[time=2390] and a forbearing spirit is a spirit which is willing to give your rights up to advance the cause of Christ
[time=2398] a forbearing spirit is willing to give up rights rights that are justly yours to advance the cause of Christ
[time=2407] let me give you another illustration of that would you go to Acts chapter 16 this is the Apostle Paul his first visit in the city of Philippi
[time=2416] book that we're now studying he had been called there through a vision of God the Macedonian vision taking the gospel to Europe for the first time
[time=2426] he arrives there in Philippi he meets the lady Lydia she's a seller of purple fabrics he tells her about God she accepts Jesus Christ as her Savior she's baptized
[time=2436] the ministry is off to a great start but there's this demon possessed slave woman that begins to follow Paul and Silas all around saying things about them
[time=2444] and it eventually irritates them to the point that in verse 18 you'll see I command Paul says I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her
[time=2454] and it came out of her at that very moment that angered her masters in verse 19 who saw their hope of profit was gone
[time=2461] they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities verse 22 a crowd arose up together against them and the chief magistrates tore their robes off of them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods
[time=2477] and when they had inflicted many blows upon them they threw them into prison commanding the jailer to guard them securely
[time=2483] and he having such a command threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in stocks
[time=2489] this is an unpleasant circumstance to be beaten with rods eventually flazed the flesh on your back
[time=2498] to be thrown in stocks it was a device that would separate your legs and hold them in that position such that your joints couldn't move
[time=2505] and the chemical that your body excretes causes great pain you've experienced it when you've driven too long in the same direction without getting out to rest
[time=2512] the inner prison was a dark dungeon without sanitary provision I won't say anymore but let your mind work on that a little bit
[time=2520] they were in pain and they were in darkness and it's stunk and they were an agony in one sense
[time=2526] but look at verse 25 but about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God and the prisoners were listening to them
[time=2538] isn't it interesting that what is described immediately prior to verse 25 where it says they're praying and praising God
[time=2545] is this list of tragedy that had come into their life they were aware that they were in stocks they were aware that their circumstances were unfavourable
[time=2553] but they were allowing those circumstances to drive them and faith the God accepting that reality and finding their joy in God
[time=2561] but you say what does this have to do with a forbearing spirit look at verse 12 notice that Philippi is a Roman colony
[time=2572] a Roman colony Paul was a Roman citizen did you know it was against Roman law to do what they did to him by pulling him out into the marketplace
[time=2583] in a crowd rising up in a riot of sorts a Roman citizen in a Roman colony could never be treated that way he must have a proper trial
[time=2593] did you also know that by virtue of being a Roman citizen you could never be beaten with rods as he was against Roman law
[time=2601] never should a Roman have that happen to him all Paul had to do when those magistrates took a hold of him and drug him into the marketplace was say did you know that I'm a Roman citizen and it would have stopped immediately
[time=2613] just gone but he didn't he gave up his rights as a Roman citizen and I don't know what was going on between he and the Holy Spirit
[time=2624] but because he gave up those rights and he went through all that turmoil he was thrown in that prison and you remember what happened there was an earthquake
[time=2633] and the jailer knew that if the prisoners were free he'd die so he was going to kill himself and Paul said wait and gave him the gospel
[time=2640] and the Philippian jailer and his entire household were baptized that night a forbearing spirit is a willingness to give up your rights to advance the cause of Christ
[time=2652] and you say wait a minute does that mean that as a Christian I have to roll over and play dead in my marketplace and my business
[time=2658] and my with my children with my school system and in the daily throws of life am I just to give up on my rights
[time=2666] no look at verse 37 Paul said to them actually verse 36 the jailer reported these words to Paul saying the chief magistrates have sent to release you
[time=2680] now therefore come out and go in peace in other words we want you out of this prison and we want you out of this city first you cast this demon out of this woman now we've got earthquakes because of you would you please leave verse 37 but Paul said to them they have beaten us in public without trial men who are now he reveals it Romans
[time=2700] and have thrown us into prison and now they are sending us away secretly no indeed
[time=2706] let them come themselves and bring us out and the policeman reported these words to the chief magistrates and they were afraid
[time=2714] when they heard that they were Romans these guys knew they were in trouble because they had broken Roman law
[time=2721] and they came out and appealed to them verse 39 and when they had brought them out they kept begging them to leave the city
[time=2729] but he didn't leave the city look what he did they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia who just come to know Christ
[time=2735] and deserve the right to be encouraged by this great apostle Paul and that he could explain to her the realities of Christian life
[time=2742] and that what had happened to them was all within the sovereign plan of God and then he went on from there and he saw the other brethren the other folks that had come to Christ and then he departed them
[time=2754] rarely in our lives will we come up to a future contingency a thing over which we feel much anxiety without having some people involved
[time=2762] maybe it's a boss maybe it's a family member usually there's a personality or two involved and what God is calling us to do
[time=2770] is to examine those relationships in the midst of that anxious moment and say it am I demanding my rights here for my own benefit
[time=2779] for my own well-being or would I be willing as best as I can understand with my finite mind to either stand for my rights or give my rights up
[time=2790] and to make that decision based not upon my own pleasure and my own personal success but upon the advancement of the kingdom of God
[time=2799] for bearing spirit let's go back to Philippians 4 rejoice in the Lord always let your forebearing spirit be known to all men the Lord is near
[time=2813] and then be anxious for nothing and he gives us some help here in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
[time=2823] let your requests be made known to God when I read this verse began to study it even years ago I always wondered why there were so many different words for prayer in this verse
[time=2836] do you see in there prayer supplication thanksgiving and then requests I mean it seems redundant why didn't you just say be anxious for nothing in everything
[time=2848] pray so I began to do a little research and I found out there were some nuances to each one of these words the first one prayer is the basic generic word in the Bible just to open the lines of communication with God
[time=2862] it's just the average everyday word for prayer talk to God the next word however supplication has a very distinctive meaning and I wish we had time to go back into the Old Testament and develop it for you
[time=2874] but it describes the humble cry of a dependent heart it describes the cry that comes out of a heart that knows that he is absolutely vulnerable to that future contingency it's out of his control
[time=2887] the downside is horrible the upside would be fine but it's not within my power to determine which way that thing is going to go
[time=2897] to open the lines of communication and then to supplicate to cry out and say God I acknowledge that I am dependent I am not an infinite self-sufficient being
[time=2907] I am your creature and I'm not in control of my world and that frightens me at times and it's frightening me right now with respect to the future contingency
[time=2916] I'm in trouble God the next word is thanksgiving and I think in the context it's fair to say that what he's asking us to do is to thank God in advance
[time=2930] for the outcome of that future contingency maybe we're waiting on some tests this is hypothetical from a medical exam it's hypothetical for me it may not be for you
[time=2941] and the possibility of this test will reveal cancer lethal cancer and you're waiting now these five days to hear from your doctor and just find out just how much trouble you might be in a future contingency
[time=2956] the downside is death the upside is life the upside is the chance to continue to raise your children the upside is to grow old with your wife
[time=2967] saying open the lines of communication talk to me come to me acknowledging that you are dependent upon me and that you're not in control of that test result and the cancer that it may reveal
[time=2978] but right here and now before you hear the result thank me for what I'm going to do thank me for what I'm going to do and then this last word I love request
[time=2990] means a specific petition a specific petition and this is God our heavenly father to whom we cry Abba Father saying yeah I want you to pray and I want you to supplicate
[time=3003] and I want you to thank me regardless of what I'm going to do but now what would you like how would you really like it to work out I want to know say it to me in detail come before me in the sanctuary of your own heart and maybe with your wife and your kids
[time=3017] and let's talk about you there's room in my kingdom for you to tell me not just what you ought to say but what you really want doesn't mean he's going to give it but it sure is good to know he's ready to hear it doesn't it
[time=3031] our gracious God desires to hear the longing of your heart for how you're hoping your life might work rejoice in the Lord always but your forbearing spirit be known to all men be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known to God and look at verse 7
[time=3058] the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus the word guards in verse 7 is an interesting word it's a military term and it describes some men whose job it was to stand at the city gate
[time=3076] but it's a peculiar word and then it does not describe what you'd naturally think their job of course would be to protect people from getting in the city who shouldn't come in that's not what this word means this word describes a different function they stand at the gate and they guard who goes out
[time=3094] it's their job to monitor flow out of the city not into the city as we're in the middle of a passage on anxiety and as you and I know when people struggle profoundly with anxiety even Christians struggling profoundly with anxiety they begin to lose their what
[time=3115] they begin to lose their faculties they begin to lose their heart and their mind and all kinds of difficult and strange behavior begins to develop in a person's life who really struggles with anxiety
[time=3132] fears and phobias in an extreme sense I'm not talking about the fear of height which many of you probably feel I'm talking about a well developed serious case of anxiety people lose their mind
[time=3144] what God is saying is give yourself to these principles not as a quick fix not as something which instantly solves your problem but you hang on to the truth of this and it will guard
[time=3156] they will stand as watchmen at the city gate and they'll watch what goes out of your heart and your mind
[time=3164] now look at verse 8 finally brethren whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is of good repute if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise let your mind dwell on these things
[time=3182] he's telling us to limit what we're allowed to think about in light of that future contingency I don't think it's good to say every time I think about that I get nervous so I don't think about it anymore now we're back to denial again
[time=3195] it's okay to think about it but the scriptures ask us to confine the thought and the musing and the meditation and those late hours at night when you can't sleep
[time=3205] at least channel that to those dimensions about that future contingency the good side or the bad side to those things which are true to those things which are honorable right pure lovely of good repute any excellence and worthy of praise
[time=3223] we've got to be thinking rational human beings God gave us a mind it's not fair to say I won't think about it what he is saying is please focus your thoughts and don't allow yourself to run down all the what ifs so that you stir up the anxiety
[time=3242] and you stir up the lack of faith and the fear look at verse 9 the things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things and the God of peace shall be with you now I want you to notice the verb again practice these things it's a verb that is often used in scripture
[time=3271] and it means to have as the habitual pattern of your life the habitual characteristic pattern of your life if you're given to staying in great shape and you spend an hour to an hour and a half every day and exercising maybe you're a runner or you're a biker or you're whatever you are
[time=3289] it would be true to say the practice of your life is exercise that's what this means doesn't mean you never don't do it it doesn't mean you're perfect it just means practice these things
[time=3300] make them the pattern of your life will make what the pattern of my life look again at verse 9 the things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me practice these things what is that that's their Bible
[time=3315] all they had was Paul all they had at this time in history was what Paul had shared with them had shown them what they had received and heard and seen in him and what he's basically saying is that the underpinning
[time=3328] of our life that is able to deal with those traumatic events in such a way that anxiety doesn't overrule and we get into all kinds of trouble is a life of obedience
[time=3339] a life of obedience God desires from us a characteristic pattern of obedience a foundation upon which when those difficult days do come into our lives we can begin to rejoice in the Lord always
[time=3353] be known to be anxious for nothing to let the requests be made known to God to focus the mind to dwell only on these things and then to practice a life of obedience
[time=3369] notice that next to every one of these there's an absolute term rejoice always for bearing spirit to all men anxious for nothing such an encouragement there is no circumstance in your life these are absolute unconditional commands
[time=3382] that is beyond the truth of this scripture as much as we'll struggle with it God will struggle with us
