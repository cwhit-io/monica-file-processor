[time=0] Do you ever have trouble managing your money between the house payment, the car payment,
[time=7] just trying to stay clothed and in your right mind?
[time=10] One of the responsibilities that we have as believers is to be regularly giving to our church.
[time=15] How much should we give?
[time=17] How do we set an amount?
[time=18] Is the answer tithing?
[time=19] Stay with us this morning.
[time=20] We're going to study God's word in the biblical pattern for New Testament giving.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Auto, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=42] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=44] Thank you for joining us.
[time=46] Over the years, Black Hawk has been richly blessed by God and has enjoyed a pattern of continued growth throughout its 22 years of ministry.
[time=54] As we look forward to a new building program, we as a church and as individuals must decide how we will meet the financial challenges.
[time=62] What does the Bible say about how we use, make, and spend our money?
[time=67] Today Pastor Moore is in part two of our four messages on biblical stewardship.
[time=71] We will be looking at giving in the New Testament.
[time=75] Please have your Bibles open and ready as we move through the New Testament.
[time=79] Our special music today includes a selection from our own Handel Choir and a solo from
[time=85] Read La Favor.
[time=88] As we prepare for our time of worship, let's listen to the sanctuary choir and soloist Lisa Rennacher and Read La Favor as they sing, "Blessed to be a Blessing."
[time=119] As we cross the land, our church bells ring in freedom.
[time=124] We can worship as we plead, and work to achieve our greatest dreams in security and peace.
[time=135] Our fields are full and harvest, the rains have always come, and our table is a banquet,
[time=145] our silos overrun, and I know there is a reason why God has blessed us all so much.
[time=156] There is something he's expecting from every one of us.
[time=164] We can love to be a blessing, we can love to be a guitar.
[time=173] We might eat so we can pour, you'll hear, you'll hear, you'll hear, you'll hear, you'll hear, you'll hear.
[time=180] We can love to be a blessing, we can love to be a guitar.
[time=187] And the praise in freedom is a servant of us all.
[time=199] And down from ages, from Abraham to Paul, the commission has been handed to, the ones
[time=212] as great as calm, that God would bless the nations, every tribe and every tongue, until
[time=222] all creation witnesses the glory of his son.
[time=228] We must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, oh, what will be our answer?
[time=246] We must obey this sacred call for his blessing, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing

[time=1097] to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing to remain, we must obey this sacred call for his blessing And as I have said, I find it to be a very vibrant and invigorating study in my own heart, in my own life, I want to be challenged by what the Word of God has to say about the money that He has given to me and how I am to give it and use it and spend it and all the rest.
[time=1120] So it's a great, great opportunity for us to look into the Word of God.
[time=1125] We began two weeks ago by understanding and examining Old Testament giving. How did the people in the Old Testament give?
[time=1132] And briefly, by way of review, we found that there were two parts to it.
[time=1135] Two parts to Old Testament giving, required giving and free will giving.
[time=1139] The required giving was called a tithe, and there were three of them.
[time=1143] The tithe just simply meaning a tenth, a ten percent of the whole.
[time=1147] The three tithes, basically given in the Old Testament, were one, the Lord's tithe.
[time=1152] Leviticus 27, so called, because it was given to the Lord and the house of the Lord, and He gave it to the Levites, that He might support the government, if you will, or the theocracy, and they ran the temple, and that was the government of the day, and they had to eat. They were not given an inheritance in the land.
[time=1167] They had no way of making that for themselves, and so the people gave.
[time=1170] Ten percent in the Lord's tithe.
[time=1173] A second tithe is the festival tithe, which was also a form of taxation.
[time=1178] In order to support the social ambiance or milieu of the nation, it was to encourage fellowship
[time=1184] and a gratitude and a gracious sense of distribution of wealth.
[time=1190] The festival tithe, for the social reinforcement of the nation, Deuteronomy 12.
[time=1195] There was a third tithe called the poor tithe, and that was a form of welfare.
[time=1200] It was gathered up and given to the needy, the widow, and the poor, Deuteronomy 14.
[time=1206] These three tithes, the last was given once every three years, brought the Old Testament tithing system to about 23 percent.
[time=1215] And it really was a form of taxation. It was compulsory. It was required giving, and it was to support the theocracy of the nation of Israel.
[time=1223] We found in the Old Testament the second category, the free will giving, came under two major categories. The first fruits, as described in Numbers 18, was an offering that the people brought not by requirement.
[time=1235] There was no specified percentage or amount.
[time=1238] It was instead given of the first fruits of their harvest.
[time=1241] And because it was given at the very beginning, and without knowing what the rest of the season would bring, it was called the first fruits offering, and it was an expression of faith and their covenant-keeping God who had bound himself to them.
[time=1254] Should they obey Him and an obedience in all keeping of the law, as well as their giving, do that, he would bless them circumstantially.
[time=1262] So they could, in good conscience, give the first fruits, knowing that God would circumstantially bless the remainder of their season and care for their needs.
[time=1272] There was also, under this free will giving topic, the idea of what we did call free will giving out of Exodus 25, and the emphasis there was on the heart, on the heart.
[time=1284] As people's hearts were moved or stirred or invigorated, if you will, to give, and so they did, we find that Exodus 35 and 36 with the construction of the tabernacle,
[time=1295] that they gave so much they had to be refrained in their giving.
[time=1298] Stopped, we have enough because the Lord moved in their hearts.
[time=1303] So the Old Testament pattern of giving basically had two general components, required giving called tithing 23 and a third percent, giving to support the theocracy of the government of Israel.
[time=1317] And a second component that of free will giving, first fruits and free will, that was a giving or an offering that was not determined by percentage amount or time, but instead as the spirit would move in people's hearts.
[time=1331] New Testament giving is our subject this morning.
[time=1334] How are we then to give in the New Testament?
[time=1337] And I suggested at the end of our message two weeks ago that the New Testament giving follows the exact same pattern as the Old Testament giving.
[time=1345] There are basically two components, required giving and free will giving.
[time=1351] Required giving and free will giving.
[time=1353] To see the required giving come with me to Romans chapter 13.
[time=1359] Romans chapter 13, a familiar passage that talks to us about our government
[time=1365] and our responsibilities to our government.
[time=1369] Romans 13 verses 1 and following.
[time=1372] Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities.
[time=1377] For there is no authority except from God and those who exist, those which exist are established by God.
[time=1384] Verse 2, therefore he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God
[time=1390] and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
[time=1395] Verse 3, for rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior but for evil.
[time=1401] Do you want to have no fear of authority?
[time=1403] Do what is good and you will have praise from the same.
[time=1406] For it is a minister of God to you for good but if you do what is evil be afraid for it does not bear the sword for nothing.
[time=1413] For it is a minister of God and a vendor who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil.
[time=1418] Verse 5, therefore it is necessary to be in subjection not only because of wrath but also for conscience sake.
[time=1426] Verse 6, for because of this you also pay taxes.
[time=1430] For rulers are servants of God devoting themselves to this very thing.
[time=1435] Render to all what is due them.
[time=1437] Tax to whom taxes do, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear honor to whom honor.
[time=1444] This exact same thing is the Old Testament.
[time=1446] The government is established by God.
[time=1448] Now there is a major difference.
[time=1450] The American government is in by no means or any stretch of the imagination, a theocracy.
[time=1455] It is a wonderful government and as I have traveled around the world I am so thankful as I am sure you are that you live here in the United States of America.
[time=1464] Tremendous government is not a theocracy but it has been established by God as all the governments of the world are.
[time=1472] There is no authority except from God.
[time=1474] Those which exist are established by God.
[time=1477] The good ones and the bad ones.
[time=1479] And our responsibilities as believers under the governing authority, the national government.
[time=1485] Verse 6 is that we should pay our taxes.
[time=1488] For these rulers are servants of God devoting themselves to this very thing.
[time=1492] Render to all what is due them, pay your taxes.
[time=1497] It's interesting then to note that when you and I pay our taxes we are in the truest sense supporting the work of God.
[time=1504] And that's often how we think of our giving.
[time=1506] We give to support the work of God and when you give through the IRS and you pay your taxes you are actually giving to support the work of God and certainly it is a required giving.
[time=1517] Now I don't think that means we have to sit around and figure out if we can pay all the taxes we could possibly pay.
[time=1523] You know hire a real good CPA and tell the guy now tell me how I can pay every possible last tax.
[time=1529] I think we need to pay every tax we owe and I think when legitimate tax shelters are available and the deferral of tax I think all of that is legitimate, all of that is within the spirit of the law.
[time=1538] But nevertheless our required giving in the New Testament is to pay our taxes and when we do pay our taxes
[time=1544] we should understand that we are giving to support the work of God.
[time=1548] Jesus said in Matthew 22, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars.
[time=1553] What about the free will giving?
[time=1557] What does the New Testament say to us about free will giving, the kind of giving we do to our church?
[time=1562] The kind of giving we would do to parochurch organizations that we support and want to be helpful with.
[time=1569] How are we to give to them under the heading of free will giving?
[time=1573] Well first I want you to note that the Bible, the New Testament does not teach tithing in connection with the New Testament church.
[time=1581] Nowhere does the New Testament mention or describe or give instruction to believers of the New Testament church that they should tithe.
[time=1592] Jesus mentions scribes and Pharisees who tithe in Matthew 23 and Luke 11 and Luke 18.
[time=1599] But he never once commanded his disciples to tithe and by tithe I mean 10% of their annual income.
[time=1606] Never did that and he could have.
[time=1608] Paul writes volumes in the New Testament about sharing and giving of our material possessions
[time=1614] and caring for the needs of the poor and supporting and sustaining various Christian ministries.
[time=1619] He urges that that should be done even with great generosity but he never once demands as a command from God that any specific amount be given.
[time=1628] Never once, not only does he not say tithe he doesn't even give a 5% or a 5th he gives no amount ever in his teaching on how much we should give.
[time=1639] The writer of the book of Hebrews and you know the book of Hebrews was written to people who had come out of Judaism,
[time=1645] people who had been raised in the tithing system and who were now struggling with this idea of the sufficiency of Christ
[time=1651] and having left behind all the cultic exercises of the nation of Israel and now trusting only in Christ for faith
[time=1658] and they were in that very turmoil and struggle and so the book of Hebrews is written to them.
[time=1663] And that book does not tell them to tithe.
[time=1666] In no way teaches its readers to tithe or to follow any example of tithing.
[time=1671] Now as you remember Abram's tithe is recorded in the book of Hebrews but as we looked at that two weeks ago that tithe was not a required giving.
[time=1680] He was 10% out of his spoils of war that was in no way commanded of him by God but instead given out of the gratefulness of his heart
[time=1687] for victory in war and given to God's representative Melchizedek.
[time=1693] So the New Testament does not teach that the New Testament church is to tithe.
[time=1699] It's just not there.
[time=1701] In fact instead of words like tithing or law or requirement, the New Testament has an entirely different glossary of giving words.
[time=1714] We won't turn there, 1 Corinthians 16-3.
[time=1717] It's the word gift or grace.
[time=1719] It says this, "I will send whomever you approve to carry your gifts, char us in the Greek to Jerusalem."
[time=1727] So it's seen as a grace gift.
[time=1730] And 2 Corinthians 8-4, another word is used in connection with giving and that is the word fellowship or coinonia.
[time=1736] It says there of the Macedonian saints desiring to give to the saints at Jerusalem, begging us with much in treaty for the favor of participation or coinonia in the support of the saints.
[time=1749] Another word used instead of law and requirement and tithe is the word ministry.
[time=1754] 2 Corinthians 9-1, "For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this ministry to the saints, for I know your readiness."
[time=1762] The word ministry is the Greek word diacanoia, which is the word from which we derive the word deacon or deaconess.
[time=1768] And it just means the servant or the service of the servant.
[time=1772] Another word is used in connection with giving is 2 Corinthians 9-5.
[time=1778] And it's the word ulagia, from which we get our word eulogy and it means praise or blessing.
[time=1784] 2 Corinthians 9-5 and a range beforehand, your previously promised bountiful gift.
[time=1791] Your gift of praise, your gift of eulogy, your gift of blessing.
[time=1798] So instead of a New Testament that teaches a prescribed amount, a definite amount that must be given,
[time=1805] the new dictionary, if you will, is constructed with words such as a grace gift or a coinonia gift,
[time=1813] a fellowship gift or a service gift of ministry or a gift of praise and blessing.
[time=1820] And we are left to draw the inescapable conclusion that the Christian giving is to be voluntary.
[time=1827] It is to be an act of his free will.
[time=1829] It is a non-compulsory sharing of his material possessions with no stipulated amount such as a tax,
[time=1837] a tithe that might be demanded of him.
[time=1843] Say, "How much should I give?" IRS tells me how much I have to give.
[time=1849] They're real clear on that.
[time=1851] How much am I supposed to give to the church?
[time=1854] How much am I supposed to give to other parent church organizations?
[time=1858] Missionaries I care about and want to support.
[time=1860] How much?
[time=1862] Answer.
[time=1864] How much you want?
[time=1870] Giving amounts are personally determined.
[time=1875] Turn with me to 2 Corinthians 9, 2 Corinthians 9.
[time=1882] How much should I give?
[time=1885] Answer.
[time=1886] However much you want to give.
[time=1893] 2 Corinthians 9 is a part of this discussion that Paul is having with the saints at Corinth
[time=1902] in an effort to raise some money for the folks in Jerusalem who were suffering.
[time=1908] And he says in 2 Corinthians 9, verse 7, "Let each one do just as he has purposed in his heart."
[time=1916] Not grudgingly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver.
[time=1920] How much?
[time=1921] What percent?
[time=1922] However much or whatever percent you want.
[time=1925] Whatever is in your heart to do.
[time=1929] Turn back a page to chapter 8.
[time=1933] And notice he's commenting on the Macedonian saints.
[time=1936] These are the saints at Philippi and Thessalonica and Berea.
[time=1939] It's an area called Macedonia.
[time=1941] And they had already given to the saints at Jerusalem.
[time=1944] They were under strict social ostracism because of their profess faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=1949] And times were hard for them and Jerusalem had even undergone a great famine in the surrounding area.
[time=1954] And the saints at Jerusalem were destitute and in poverty.
[time=1957] And the saints at Macedonia heard about it.
[time=1960] In verse 2, "That in great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality."
[time=1967] See the fact was even the Macedonian saints were hurting.
[time=1970] They were in an ordeal of affliction.
[time=1972] But they gave how they give.
[time=1974] Verse 3, "For I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability they gave of their own what?
[time=1981] Their own accord.
[time=1982] They did it out of the goodness of their own heart and they set the amount in their own heart according to their ability."
[time=1988] For begging us with much in treaty for the favor of, there's our word, "coinonia" of participation in the support of the saints.
[time=1996] They gave themselves first of the Lord and then they gave their offering.
[time=2001] It's a tremendous reality.
[time=2004] We see the same thing happening in the life of Zacchaeus.
[time=2007] And when he comes to Christ and he finally has a personal relationship with the true and living God, he says in his own heart.
[time=2013] And just purposes it in his own life, "I'm going to give half of everything I own to the poor."
[time=2019] Where did he get that figure?
[time=2021] Out of his heart?
[time=2022] "I'm going to give half of it away and if I've done anybody wrong I'll repay them fourfold." Where did he get that?
[time=2028] Out of his heart?
[time=2030] For him giving was a spontaneous act of love and gratitude in response to the great and awesome gift of salvation.
[time=2037] It was not law keeping.
[time=2039] It was an amount to be determined in his own heart as is ours.
[time=2044] The important thing is that we have a willing heart to give.
[time=2048] So the question remains then.
[time=2050] Are we left with no guidelines as to how to give?
[time=2054] I know now that I'm supposed to give however much I want but can you help me know how much I should want to give?
[time=2061] Are we just left with the idea that it's voluntary free will, there's no percent, no amount personally determined and that's it?
[time=2069] Well there are about I have nine or ten principles in the New Testament that help us answer that question.
[time=2076] How much should I personally determine to give?
[time=2079] Let's look at the first one.
[time=2081] If you'd open your Bible then to Mark chapter 12.
[time=2086] This is the familiar story of the widow and the widow's might.
[time=2091] And I have to confess my heart was so blessed this week as I looked at it again and discovered things about it I had not known.
[time=2100] She was truly a remarkable woman as you will see she was a uniquely Christ-like woman.
[time=2109] Verses 41 to 44 Mark 12.
[time=2114] And he sat down namely Jesus opposite the treasury and began observing how the multitude were putting money into the treasury and many rich people were putting in large sums.
[time=2125] And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins which amount to a cent.
[time=2131] And calling his disciples to him he said to them truly I say to you this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury for they all put in out of their surplus but she out of her poverty put in all she owned all she had to live on.
[time=2152] Jesus has found himself a seat that says in verse 41 opposite the treasury this is inside the temple and if you were to enter the temple from the west side you would go across Solomon's porch and then through a very narrow strip of the Gentiles court and then you would enter a rather large area called the woman's court so named because that was as far into the temple as the women in that they were allowed to proceed.
[time=2173] And in the women's court there were 13 trumpet shaped receptacles hanging on the walls kind of a V shape trumpet shaped receptacles and you'd put your money in that and it would fall through that and back behind the wall and into the coffers.
[time=2187] And Jesus it says has sat down he has sat down opposite the treasury and he has begun observing how the multitudes were putting money into the treasury.
[time=2197] Those verbs sat down and began observing our imperfect verbs meaning that Jesus continued to sit there and he continued to observe he was taking a little bit of time doing this.
[time=2210] I find it very interesting in the context of this passage to note what is immediately before this little narrative of or description of the poor widow look up in verses 38 39 and 40.
[time=2221] You know what that is that's Mark's brief synopsis of the Lord's great fifth discourse the seven woes he pronounced upon the scribes and Pharisees which are recorded in Matthew chapter 23.
[time=2237] Mark doesn't record the whole thing he just in Matthew 23 it's a long long long long series of woes seven or eight woes and Jesus just gives a scathing denunciation against these scribes and Pharisees for their hypocritical religious system.
[time=2250] But in Mark here verses 38 39 and 40 he just takes little bits of it and puts it in here as a synopsis.
[time=2257] Jesus apparently has just finished giving this great discourse the great fifth discourse this this denunciation of the scribes and the Pharisees and he seems to be a little tired and so he sits his weary body somewhere in the women's court where he has clear view of these trumpet shaped receptacles.
[time=2274] Now notice one of the things that Mark happens to pull out of the fifth discourse in verse 40 it says that they devour widows houses.
[time=2283] These scribes and these Pharisees are in the process of devouring widows houses how did they devour widows houses well they had a number of ways but it was primarily a financial huckster situation.
[time=2295] In some cases they would offer the widow whose husband may have recently died and he would have had some property and potentially some debt and all that had to get wrapped up and consolidated.
[time=2305] And the scribes and the Pharisees might have offered their help to assist in all of this and in the process manage to manipulate great sums of the estate into their own personal finances and steal from them in that way and devour or feast upon
[time=2320] fattening themselves would be a literal translation of this devouring widows houses they were fattening themselves on the houses of widows.
[time=2328] They would also do it by taking unfair advantage of their goodwill the widows would be responsive at points and be willing to give to the priests and to the scribes and the Pharisees just a little offering just to help them and they would begin to exploit that and build that up.
[time=2345] Get more and more out of it the other way they would do it is real common with the way that a lot of hucksters and religion get money even the day they'll present a very powerful need some place in the world or even in a particular city that might be local
[time=2358] and they'll hype that need up as big as they possibly can and then it gets the response of the people and did you know that a lot of the money that goes and is given to some of the television hucksters of our day comes right out of the welfare checks of the widows.
[time=2373] They did a study on where a lot of these guys get their money who's giving to that stuff you'll watch it on TV say who's giving to that stuff I'll tell you who's giving to that stuff widows are giving to that stuff people who are on welfare and have their little social security checks and they give what they can.
[time=2387] And apparently the scribes and Pharisees were very adept at that same thing putting out some great cause and then finding a way to grab a large percentage of what is given for themselves leaving the household destitute fattening themselves upon it.
[time=2402] So Jesus has just decried and denounced and cursed these men and their false religious system wearied by it all he sits down in the court right where he can view the giving of the people.
[time=2415] And though it's not explicitly stated my hunch is that one of these widows one of these gals the poor widow and view here has been devoured by these scribes and Pharisees she has been the object of their manipulative ploy and they have found ways to get their hands into her money
[time=2431] and she is now poor.
[time=2434] Notice it says she's poor verse 42 and a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins.
[time=2440] The Greek word therefore poor describes that of abject poverty one who is literally out of everything has nothing and is in imminent danger of real starvation.
[time=2451] She is just at the bottom of her financial resources probably brought there by this false religious system.
[time=2460] It says she put in two small copper coins, two small copper coins.
[time=2469] The Greek word is lepta and it means an eighth of a cent.
[time=2474] Actually that's what her contribution was the word lepta means a quarter of what?
[time=2480] A quarter of actually an azerius which is a sixteenth of a denarius and a denarius was one day's wage.
[time=2488] So her little coin a lepta by itself was an eighth of a cent and when you add it to the other when you get a quarter of a cent.
[time=2497] It was nothing, lepta is a word from which we derive our word leaf.
[time=2502] It was thin, paper thin, it was light, it was flighty, it was frivolous, there was nothing to it.
[time=2510] It was visually what it was monetarily, it was a little lepta, two of them.
[time=2515] And together they totaled a quarter of a cent and you say no wait a minute.
[time=2520] It says right there in verse 42 the poor widow came and put in two small copper coins which amount to a cent.
[time=2526] Well this word here, this cent in verse 42 is a Roman cent.
[time=2531] Mark is writing to Gentiles and Romans about Christ the servant.
[time=2535] And so he switches his terms on you in mid verse.
[time=2538] The two small copper coins were Jewish coinage and this cent was a Roman coinage and it totaled up to a Roman cent.
[time=2546] In significant amount of money, wouldn't even buy a priest a lunch, a thin little piece of copper.
[time=2552] But notice what Jesus does, verse 43.
[time=2556] And calling his disciples to him, he said to them, truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all the contributors to the treasury.
[time=2566] For they all put in out of their surplus but she out of her poverty put in all she owned and all that she had to live on.
[time=2574] Jesus calls his disciples together, he summons his disciples, he didn't do that very often.
[time=2579] He did it in this particular case because he wanted to rivet their attention on what she had just done.
[time=2584] And then he says with his own words truly or amen amen or verily, verily which is always the precursor to something he wants them to really understand.
[time=2594] As if to say I tell you guys a lot of things, this I want you to hear, listen to this, this is really important.
[time=2602] She has given out of her poverty.
[time=2605] This dear woman, her house probably having been devoured by the representatives of the God she loves and trusts,
[time=2611] describes in the Pharisees, has found a way to look past their treachery and their manipulation and continue to give the last that she has in an effort of total sacrificial giving to her God.
[time=2624] And as such she gave more than the others.
[time=2629] So how much should I give?
[time=2631] If giving is to be personally determined between me and the Lord, how much should it be?
[time=2637] I can't give you a percent, I give you a principle.
[time=2641] It's supposed to be sacrificial.
[time=2645] Whatever it is, it's supposed to be sacrificial.
[time=2653] Flip the one more passage with me this morning, will you?
[time=2655] 2 Corinthians 8 and 9.
[time=2663] As I was studying this week I asked myself the question, why would the Lord present this particular woman,
[time=2673] who was giving everything she had when she was about to starve?
[time=2681] Why is that recorded?
[time=2683] And why is it recorded so dramatically?
[time=2686] Where he rivets his disciples' attention on it and then says truly, verily.
[time=2693] What's going on here?
[time=2695] And I think the answer is found in 2 Corinthians 8 verse 9.
[time=2699] I believe the Lord identified completely with what this woman was doing.
[time=2704] It says there in verse 9, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2709] That though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich."
[time=2718] This is a discussion about giving.
[time=2720] This is a discussion about the Macedonian saints giving to the saints at Jerusalem.
[time=2724] This is an appeal letter by Paul to the saints at Corinthian for the same purpose.
[time=2729] And right in the middle of it we find the example of Jesus Christ in giving.
[time=2733] For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2737] That though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.
[time=2744] You see the parallel? This woman had been stripped and devoured by these scribes and these Pharisees.
[time=2754] So was Christ.
[time=2756] Christ came as the king of kings and the Lord of lords Matthew presents him coming as king to offer the kingdom.
[time=2761] And the people would have should have responded to it, but the scribes and the Pharisees at every turn of the road decried his kingship
[time=2768] and lied about his identity and led the people away from him and they devoured him if you will.
[time=2773] They fattened themselves in their religion by decrying the true and the living God.
[time=2777] And like the widow he was stripped of anything that might have been his by way of earthly glory.
[time=2784] And then like the widow on the cross when he was hanging there he gave the last of what he had to give which was his life.
[time=2791] And remember his life was not taken from him, he voluntarily gave it.
[time=2795] It says in the scriptures that he gave up his spirit.
[time=2798] It was the last thing that he had and he gave it voluntarily, sacrificially.
[time=2804] And then like the widow he put his very destiny in the hands of his God to provide for him as he became sin on our behalf.
[time=2815] Absolute complete identification with this woman who prior to his own crucifixion acted out the exact same principles.
[time=2824] Stripped and mutilated and devoured by a false religious system and their leaders.
[time=2829] So was he. Left with nothing to give but his own life.
[time=2833] So she was left with nothing to give but the last substance for her very life.
[time=2839] So was he. She willingly gave everything. So did he.
[time=2845] She trusted only in God. So did he.
[time=2851] New Testament giving. It's free will.
[time=2855] There's no particular amount. It's between you and the Lord.
[time=2861] Well how do I think through that with the Lord?
[time=2864] Principle number one. Giving is to be sacrificial.
[time=2870] Jesus says through this story with the poor widow that the essence of giving is sacrifice.
[time=2879] And if you are not sacrificing in your giving, you're missing the thrust of the whole point.
[time=2888] Jesus gives you and he gives me an opportunity to sacrifice. How much?
[time=2892] How much should I sacrifice in my giving? Everything.
[time=2901] Everything. How much did the widow give? Everything.
[time=2906] How much did Jesus give? He was rich. For your sake he became poor.
[time=2911] He gave everything. You say are you serious? Are you really serious?
[time=2918] Yes. Give everything. You say but wait a minute.
[time=2923] If I give everything, I can't provide for my family and then the Bible says I'm worse than a heretic.
[time=2928] Right. That's why you don't give everything.
[time=2932] But you're sure willing to give everything. It's a completely different perspective than that.
[time=2938] You know how I sometimes figure out my giving or prior to my study of this passage?
[time=2941] I figured out how I was going to sacrificially give.
[time=2943] I get my budget set and we have a family budget and we get it all set.
[time=2946] And then I look at it and I go now what do I want to give up so that I can be sacrificial in giving?
[time=2954] I'm afraid the Lord would have me start a different way.
[time=2956] Start for those of you who are in business with a zero based budget.
[time=2960] God at the beginning I'm giving you absolutely everything.
[time=2965] My cars, my house, my finances, everything that constitutes my net worth, it's yours.
[time=2973] Now how much would you like me to keep so that I can take care of my family
[time=2980] and I can have a good testimony in this community of unbelievers?
[time=2987] God I am willing to give you everything.
[time=2992] How much do you want me to keep back?
[time=2995] That's really the only question that remains.
[time=2997] So that I can be faithful to provide for the things you have given me to do.
[time=3006] You know in a very real sense, the Lord is still sitting in the treasury and He is still observing.
[time=3013] Imperfect tense, He is still in the process of sitting and He is still in the process of observing.
[time=3019] He's just now at the right hand of the throne of God but He is watching absolutely everything.
[time=3025] He knows what we're doing.
[time=3028] And you know what He's looking for in our giving?
[time=3031] Sacrifice.
[time=3034] No amount, no specified percentage in the privacy and the sanctuary of our own hearts.
[time=3043] We go before God and we say, "God, how much should I give?"
[time=3049] Principle number one, give sacrificially.
[time=3055] David said as much, "I will not give the Lord that which costs me what?"
[time=3062] Nothing.
[time=3063] "I will not give the Lord that which costs me nothing." 2 Samuel 24, 24.
[time=3068] And herein is the interesting paradox of salvation.
[time=3073] We couldn't buy our salvation if we wanted to.
[time=3076] The most valuable commodity in the whole world.
[time=3079] We can't buy it.
[time=3080] Isaiah 55, "Oh, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, come by wine and milk without money and without cost."
[time=3089] That which would satisfy our spiritual souls and the regeneration of true and living salvation we couldn't buy if we had to.
[time=3096] Our money is no good.
[time=3099] It's all free.
[time=3100] The really valuable things in life are really all free.
[time=3108] But then he comes back and says as to your earthly possessions, give sacrificially, how sacrificially, everything.
[time=3119] And only hold back for yourself what you need to be a faithful testimony and a witness for the cause of Christ.
[time=3131] It wasn't a word prayer.
[time=3137] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, how thankful we are that you throw us on the horns of a dilemma.
[time=3145] It's a difficult place to be, to be void of a particular amount or a particular percentage by divine decree.
[time=3155] Many of us do have amounts in our own hearts and minds and those are fine because they are determined out of our relationship with you.
[time=3162] But you want us to grapple.
[time=3164] You want us to struggle.
[time=3165] You want us to examine our hearts.
[time=3167] You want us to look at the sacrifice which Christ has made.
[time=3169] And you want us to look at the sacrifice the poor widow made.
[time=3172] And you want us to be there in the quiet hour of prayer saying, "How much would you have me to give?"
[time=3184] Father, we pray that you would, through the Spirit of God, give us wisdom.
[time=3188] Help us to walk in that tension.
[time=3190] Help us to walk in that place even of uncertainty as we struggle in our hearts to be completely willing
[time=3199] yet face the practical demands of our lives.
[time=3203] Father, we thank you for the great and awesome things which fill our lives.
[time=3207] We are blessed beyond wildest measure.
[time=3210] We have more things and more food and more clothing and all the rest than most of the people in the world.
[time=3217] And we don't have that because we deserve it.
[time=3221] We don't have that because we are some special, unique people.
[time=3224] We don't have that because of anything other than your grace.
[time=3227] You are giving first to us.
[time=3230] We love you.
[time=3232] And we want you to continue to prompt our hearts in this great theme of giving.
[time=3240] Pray these things in Jesus name. Amen. Let's stand together for a closing song.
[time=3250] I don't know if Pastor Kobe is with us this morning at this point.
[time=3260] Let's sing page 186. There you are. Thank you, Peter. Got me off the hook.
