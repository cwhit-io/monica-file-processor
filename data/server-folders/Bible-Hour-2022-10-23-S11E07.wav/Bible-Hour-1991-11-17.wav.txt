[time=14] Knowing how much to give is never an easy thing to do.
[time=17] Especially when you realize the Bible doesn't teach us to tithe.
[time=21] It teaches us to give as we've purposed in our own heart.
[time=23] Stay with us this morning.
[time=24] We'll study about eight principles the New Testament teaches on how we're to give.
[time=29] [MUSIC]
[time=41] Welcome to the Bible Hour and our Bible Study, Music, and Fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=47] Thank you for joining us as a result of continuing growth in our services and an urgent need to provide additional room for our adult Bible fellowship groups and our Christian school, Black Ock is preparing to build new facilities.
[time=61] In concert with those plans, Pastor Russ is conducting a study on biblical stewardship.
[time=66] Three weeks ago, he looked at Old Testament giving.
[time=69] Last week, he began to look at giving as it is taught and illustrated in the New Testament.
[time=74] Today, he will continue that message by looking at a number of other examples of New Testament stewardship.
[time=79] Please have your Bibles open and ready as Pastor Russ uses several passages in the New
[time=85] Testament.
[time=87] Our special music today includes a soul from Denise Mitchell entitled "For All the World" and a number from Reflection entitled "We Are Victors."
[time=99] As we prepare for our time of worship, let's listen to the sanctuary choir and orchestra as they sing "Be Exalted, O God."
[time=115] [MUSIC - 205 seconds]

[time=351] [MUSIC - 325 seconds]
[time=706] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=711] As we're recording this on this Sunday we are just excited about the ministry that we have in future building plans for Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=720] And Russell with Larnell Harris here, this has been an exhilarating time and a time to just really remind us of the ministry that we have at Blackhawk and what's to come.
[time=728] Well, it was a great time of celebration, just praising God for how far we've come in the building program and anticipating the completion.
[time=735] I love Larnell Harris, he's such a family man, he really makes an effort while he sings around the country.
[time=740] He makes a genuine effort to get back with his family at home and he's very active as a deacon in his church and we're delighted that we had the opportunity to have Larnell Harris with us.
[time=750] Many of you were here for the living Christmas tree ticket distribution and I know that some of you are very excited and some are not as excited because we ran out of tickets.
[time=761] And also this is the first time in the 15 years that I've been associated with the tree that I remember the tickets going this fast and while we're delighted with that we're sorry that some of the people that came yesterday didn't get an opportunity to get tickets.
[time=775] Now by run out you mean of course that we gave away all of our seats, it wasn't that we didn't have enough printed, it was that we gave away all the seats.
[time=782] We printed 25,000 tickets for the 10 concerts and they are all gone, somebody has them in their hands.
[time=789] Now if you have a friend that has some tickets you might ask them if they've got any extras that aren't designated to somebody else and perhaps you can try calling the church office.
[time=801] There is a waiting list but we're just really sorry about that and we're anticipating perhaps adding a concert or two next year but it's exciting and yet at the same time we're sorry that some of you were here.
[time=811] And weren't able to get tickets, that really caught us off guard and we apologize for that.
[time=817] Also we've been talking about this gift offer called Christ in Christmas, a family advent celebration and certainly Christmas is an excellent time to gather the family around and talk about Jesus.
[time=827] I think that's true, you know Christmas comes and you're looking for the opportunity to do something family, something special, something around the thought of Christ and this little book is a helpful tool to do that.
[time=838] It'll lead us through some important dialogue and discussion and study about Christmas and the angels and all the rest that went with it and I'm looking forward to using it.
[time=847] I know I just have that sense, you know Christmas and the hot apple cider and all the rest but it's got to be more than that.
[time=853] It's got to be sitting down as a family and thinking about Christ and I think that's a good tool to do it.
[time=858] I can't put my children on my lap anymore but we still do gather around and they'll say, "Dad, it's time to at least read the Christmas story and remind us of it even though they're well up in age now."
[time=869] But those were great times and I encourage you to get a book like this and in particular this one and hurry and write for it so that you can have it in time for the Christmas holidays.
[time=878] You can receive it by writing to the Bible hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=889] Once again you can write for this book Christ in Christmas by writing to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=902] Russell, many of the Founders Club members have the devotional booklet called Fresh Moments and I don't know how this happened but we received a letter this last week from an inmate in Florida who was reading through the Fresh Moments devotional
[time=916] and bowed and asked Christ to come into his heart and asked for some more literature on Christianity and I was an encouragement to my heart.
[time=925] So those of you that have the Fresh Moments, I hope that you're using it as a daily devotional guide to keep you in the scriptures and be encouraged by that because it really is important to be in God's Word for daily guidance from him and your prayer life is very important too.
[time=941] So we thank you for the letters. It's a great encouragement to us. If you have something to tell us of inspiration through the Bible hour, write to us and I want to give you that address one more time.
[time=951] You can just write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=960] We go back now to more music from Reflection and then the message from our Pastor Teacher Russell Moore.
[time=965] I hope that you'll stay with us for the remainder of the broadcast.
[time=982] We are the doors. We are conquerors. We have triumphed through the blood of the land.
[time=1006] We're God's children, join us with Jesus.
[time=1017] And against us, no power on earth can stand.
[time=1029] We walk through this veil of darkness and live with the will of the lost.
[time=1041] The world with its passions and selfish rage refuses to count the cause.
[time=1052] But our hope is angered in Jesus and we can cope with the pain and the loss.
[time=1063] Though our mind is all that's around us, we are hardly the power of the cause.
[time=1076] We are victims. We are conquerors.
[time=1088] We have triumphed through the blood of the land.
[time=1099] We're God's children, join us with Jesus.
[time=1110] And against us, no power on earth can stand.
[time=1121] We are victims. We are conquerors.
[time=1133] We have triumphed through the blood of the land.
[time=1144] We're God's children, join us with Jesus.
[time=1155] And against us, no power on earth can stand.
[time=1184] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1197] Amen, thank you so much.
[time=1199] Children of God, joint heirs of Jesus.
[time=1202] And against us, no power on earth can stand.
[time=1206] Powerful, powerful song.
[time=1209] Well, we come again this morning to this topic of giving or stewardship.
[time=1215] And for those of you who might be visiting or new to Blackhawk since the series began, I just want you to know this is not our normal pattern to emphasize giving quite this much with the testimonies and the messages.
[time=1227] Actually, we're in a series on 1 Timothy.
[time=1230] We finished chapter 1 and we'll go back to chapter 2 as the Lord allows us.
[time=1234] That's really our pattern just to preach expositionally through the scriptures.
[time=1238] But we have taken some time in light of our capital funds drive to give these testimonies which I know have impacted my heart so powerfully.
[time=1245] And also to just remind ourselves what the word of God really does say about giving.
[time=1251] And I would note that it's not just messages for you folks.
[time=1255] It's messages that I believe are touching the lives of our pastoral staff and my own life and my wife Heidi and I.
[time=1262] I think we're thrilled to be giving at a level that we are.
[time=1265] I think we're giving more than we ever have in the past and we believe that's because we're so excited about this program and this church and these messages speak to us.
[time=1273] I hope like they do you.
[time=1275] And so we're really in this together.
[time=1277] This isn't some way to manipulate money out of a bunch of people and stand aloof and watch that happen.
[time=1283] I'm also thankful that this series is not coming out of some sense of desperation or demandingness within our own church.
[time=1290] We're in relatively good financial position and by God's grace should things go in the future as they have in the past.
[time=1297] Everything seems to be in good order.
[time=1299] And there really isn't an attitude of demandingness in the hearts of the board or our pastoral staff or our deacons or any of the other leadership in our church.
[time=1307] We just are trying to do this because we think this is the time to do it.
[time=1310] It's the place to do it and we're waiting for God to confirm that desire in our hearts through you folks as you give.
[time=1317] So it's a series about giving and we started in the Old Testament and found that the Old Testament has two basic components in its instruction about giving.
[time=1326] One was required giving and it came under the title of a tithe or 10% it was required and they would give about three of those.
[time=1334] One was every third year so the total combined would be about 23 and a third percent and it was given to support the theocracy or the government of Israel.
[time=1343] It was in fact attacks about 23 and a third percent.
[time=1347] In addition to that they would give free will offerings or first fruit offerings which there was no prescribed amount just out of their heart and the gratitude and the sense of what God was doing they would give above and beyond their tithe.
[time=1360] And as we have come to the New Testament we have found basically the same two components required giving and free will giving.
[time=1368] And the required giving is our taxes here in the United States of America.
[time=1372] Romans chapter 13 tells us to pay our taxes because the government though not a theocracy like that of old is nevertheless established by the authority of God to carry out his purposes and when we pay our taxes we are supporting the work of God.
[time=1387] Paying our taxes to the government is in a sense supporting the work of God and that is our required giving.
[time=1393] We found also that the New Testament calls us to be involved in free will giving.
[time=1398] The New Testament never teaches us to tie that never instructs the people of the church or the New Testament church to tie in the sense of 10% of our annual income.
[time=1408] Never once gives those instructions of the people of the church instead of the words tie or required giving or law there are other words that describe our giving in the New Testament.
[time=1419] They are the words of grace 1 Corinthians 16, 3 or fellowship.
[time=1424] So the whole glossary of words that describes the New Testament giving is quite different from a prescribed amount that is to be required that we should give.
[time=1449] Instead these other words grace fellowship ministry bountiful gift and the teaching is clear in the New Testament.
[time=1456] Our giving is to be that of a voluntary free will non compulsory sharing of our material possessions to advance the kingdom of God and to meet the needs of people.
[time=1468] Our giving amounts are to be personally determined and we looked at that in 2 Corinthians 9, 7 as each one has purposed in his own heart.
[time=1477] It's not right in the New Testament to declare that all of us should give some certain percentage or amount instead.
[time=1484] The Lord I think has made it difficult for us more difficult than were amount to be stated because now we have to grapple in our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and our commitment to the kingdom and yet our own needs and our own culture and things that are available
[time=1497] demanding our dollars and somehow we have to come up with an amount in that relationship with Christ.
[time=1504] It's difficult and the Bible gives us principles that we can follow while there may be no prescribed amount of percentage.
[time=1511] There are principles helpful principles that we can walk through as a mental checklist as we try to determine that amount.
[time=1519] We saw the first one last week giving is to be sacrificial and we looked at the widow and the widow's might, this poor woman who was giving her lepta in the Greek her 1/8 of a cent.
[time=1530] She gave two of them at total a quarter of a cent.
[time=1533] There was a nominal amount of money, almost an insignificant amount of money and yet as Jesus sat there and watched it he called his 12 disciples around and said look at what this woman is doing.
[time=1543] She's giving more than all the others who were depositing great amounts of money into the treasury.
[time=1548] He said because she gave out of her poverty, put in all she owned, all she had to live on and the salient feature that he draws to their attention is that this woman is giving sacrificially.
[time=1560] And so we learn from her and from the teaching of the Lord that we are to give sacrificially.
[time=1565] How much? How sacrificially?
[time=1568] Well she gave everything as did Christ. He who was rich became poor that we might become rich, 2 Corinthians 9.
[time=1576] And it teaches us that basic principle that everything we have is God's, everything we have is from God our earning power, our resources, our savings, our houses, our house, our cars, everything is God's.
[time=1590] And we should in our hearts understand that and be willing to give it all back to him should he required of us.
[time=1596] We hold back what we need to provide for our family and to function in this day and age, but in our hearts God it's all yours.
[time=1605] We will give sacrificially.
[time=1607] Principle number 2, if you turn with me to Luke, Luke chapter 6.
[time=1614] And Luke chapter 6 is Luke's version of the Sermon on the Mount which is recorded in greater detail over in Matthew chapter 5, 6 and 7.
[time=1624] And Jesus is coming to the end of it and in verse 38 gives us this principle that giving is investing with God.
[time=1633] Giving is investing with God, Luke 6, 38.
[time=1637] Give and it will be given to you.
[time=1640] Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will pour into your lap for by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.
[time=1652] The picture here is of filling a container, probably a woven basket, maybe made from the fibers of the palm tree branches or the rushes.
[time=1660] And it's a woven basket and as such has a certain amount of elasticity.
[time=1665] And if it's really filled up, when it's filled up it holds more than just kind of sort of filled up like a bag of potato chips.
[time=1671] You get in the store and you think it's falling open and it's mostly air and only partly potato chip.
[time=1676] Well the idea here is that when we pour this stuff back in we'll press it down and then we'll shake it together so that every nook and cranny of this basket is totally bulging and it's holding its ultimate capacity
[time=1689] and then he'll continue to pour until it's running over.
[time=1693] And it will pour into your lap and the word lap is really descriptive of the clothing that they would wear.
[time=1698] Hanging over the girdle or the belt would be some excess clothing and as this in your mind's eye as this basket is being filled and pressed down and shaken together but the Lord just keeps pouring more in and finally it's coming over the edge
[time=1711] and so you take your garment what's extra and you stick it up next to it and the stuff just starts falling into your lap into this extra bucket if you will that you have by virtue of your clothing.
[time=1720] And so it's an unbelievable return on your investment absolutely enormous return on what you've given.
[time=1727] Good measure pressed down shaken together running over and then the principle is stated at the end of verse 38 for by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.
[time=1738] Be generous when you give.
[time=1740] Give as an understanding in your mind that you're investing with God and that he will pay you back.
[time=1746] He will give you returns on your investment that will boggle your mind.
[time=1750] You say what kind of a return and how quickly does it come?
[time=1754] In other words if I give $4,000 can I expect $6,000 extra next year somehow through a raise or a bonus or my business does better?
[time=1762] I mean what kind of a return are we talking about here?
[time=1765] Well I believe that some of you could get up and say and give actual testimony in your life.
[time=1770] You know four or five years ago there was a need and we met it and we didn't really know how we survive and God has not only covered our need but He's blessed us above and beyond that.
[time=1780] And the Lord does that sometimes and that's part of the way that He returns on your investment.
[time=1785] But this is not a spiritual let's make a deal.
[time=1788] This is not I got $5,000 in my hand and I'm going to trade it away for what's behind curtain number two hoping this is the really big bonanza stuff.
[time=1795] Now that's not what the Lord is involved in here. He is saying to you that I will give you a return based upon your willingness to invest with us.
[time=1804] You may end up like CT Stud who was one of great England's greatest athletes in about the 1800s.
[time=1811] He was a world champion cricket player. He came to Christ.
[time=1815] When his father died he received 29,000 pounds and I don't know how much that equates to.
[time=1820] I've read a little bit and some suggest a quarter of a million others, maybe a half a million dollars in our current value.
[time=1827] Stud said I don't want that money to clutter up my life.
[time=1830] I think the best way to use it is to invest it with God.
[time=1834] So he gave 5,000 pounds to Hudson Taylor, 5,000 pounds to William Booth to work with the Salvation Army, 5,000 pounds to DL Moody to start a work in India.
[time=1845] Well Moody never went to India. He went to Chicago instead and started Moody Bible Institute.
[time=1851] Stud continued to give his money away until he had 3,400 pounds left which he gave to his wife on his wedding day.
[time=1858] And she said I don't want this either so she sent it off to General Booth.
[time=1862] So now they have nothing at which time Stud said now we are in the proud position to say silver and gold have I none.
[time=1869] They gave it all away. They invested every last dime in the kingdom of God and then went off to Africa to be missionaries.
[time=1876] Now it's not recorded anywhere that I know of that the studs got all this money back.
[time=1883] You know like 29,000 pounds plus the press down shaking over good measure 50,000.
[time=1888] It just didn't happen that way. To our knowledge they never got that money back but they got a huge return.
[time=1894] Hudson Taylor started the China Inland Mission, took the gospel to the inland parts of China.
[time=1899] And God has been working with those talents if you will or the seeds that were sown as the studs gave and contributed to that work.
[time=1907] And as you know when the situation lifted a little bit and we were able to get some understanding many years ago,
[time=1913] about 10 or 12 years ago of what's actually going on inside of China, they estimate that there are some 50 million believers in China.
[time=1921] It's not totally attributable to Taylor but largely it is and to his work and to the gospel that was sown by him.
[time=1928] The studs got a return on their investment.
[time=1931] D.L. Moody's record speaks for itself. The institution is now 100 years old. I was just there the other day.
[time=1936] I was standing there in front of one of their bulletin boards and the print was about, oh I don't know, a quarter of an inch high.
[time=1946] You could barely read this stuff and it was about 10 feet long and about 4 feet high.
[time=1951] And what it was was names of missionaries that were currently serving that had graduated from the Moody Bible Institute all over the world.
[time=1959] These folks got a return on their investment.
[time=1963] Consider the widow and her might.
[time=1965] You know she was a real person. That wasn't a parable. That happened.
[time=1968] She actually gave up those two little copper coins.
[time=1971] And because Jesus called the attention of his disciples to that and it got recorded in the gospel, think of all the sermons
[time=1977] and all the people that have read that account and been motivated to give sacrificially based on her example.
[time=1984] It's mind boggling to think of the return that will be hers forever in eternity because of that one sacrificial act.
[time=1993] Had some information prepared in light of this. You know if you and I were to give $4,000 a year from the time that we are 35 to 65
[time=2004] in a tax sheltered annuity that returned 8%.
[time=2008] When we turned 65, they'd write us a check for a half a million dollars, $4,000 a year.
[time=2015] Then that doesn't even count the tax benefits because it's a tax sheltered annuity.
[time=2019] So every year your taxable income would go down and that'd be less tax you'd have to pay, which would be more money you could spend.
[time=2024] Plus this $4,000 put aside, half a million dollars at 65 at one time, one check right there.
[time=2029] Now I don't know if that's what God's going to do in your life based upon your sacrificial giving in this church.
[time=2036] But I do know that you can't out give God and what he is saying to you is this, give and it will be given to you.
[time=2042] Good measure, press down, shaken together, running over, it'll pour into your lap.
[time=2048] Maybe part of his blessing will be removing excess money from your family so you don't become too materialistic
[time=2054] and lose your heart and lose your direction and he'll keep you steady on the course.
[time=2058] I don't know how he'll return, but he'll return. He promises to do so.
[time=2063] Principle number three, Luke chapter 16, just over a few pages.
[time=2070] Luke chapter 16, verse 10, Jesus is here talking about a rich man who had a steward, somebody who was going to oversee his estate,
[time=2082] and this steward was squandering the rich man's funds.
[time=2086] And Jesus draws some principles about spiritual things and about giving based upon this incident.
[time=2093] That's right there in verse 10. He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much.
[time=2099] And he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.
[time=2104] What's the principle? Giving is a matter of what you have, not what you hope to have.
[time=2110] In other words, we're so tempted at times to say, you know, if I only had more money, if I only had a larger income or a larger savings or a larger this,
[time=2118] I'd be willing to give more. And we fool ourselves.
[time=2123] The principle that the Lord is saying here is that if you aren't giving sacrificially with what you have now, you wouldn't be giving sacrificially if you had more later.
[time=2133] If you're not generous when you have a little, you won't be generous when you have a lot.
[time=2138] The basic dollar amount may change, but your generosity won't increase.
[time=2143] You're going to be the same person then as you are now, and if you're faithful with this little stuff, you'll be faithful with a lot of stuff.
[time=2148] And so the principle is be faithful with what you have.
[time=2151] Give generously and sacrificially as you invest with God on what you have right now and don't hope for the rainbow or the pot of gold at the end of it at which time you'll really make it up to God.
[time=2161] What he's interested in is that what you have now, you're faithfully giving.
[time=2167] It's a little bit like a father who owns a huge estate and knows his son will soon be in a position to inherit it, but he's concerned about his son.
[time=2176] And so he tests his son by giving him a smaller amount of the estate to handle, and he watches very carefully to see what his son does, not out of some interest in the money itself, but to measure his son's character at this point in time.
[time=2191] If he can do it with a little, he can do it with a lot, and God is evaluating our lives on that basis.
[time=2199] Principle number four is in the very next verse.
[time=2202] Verse 11, "If therefore you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous Mammon, who will entrust the true riches to you, and instead of quantity it's a quality of what's been entrusted to you.
[time=2213] If you can't handle money, how do you ever suppose to handle the true riches or the spiritual things?"
[time=2220] And so principle four is that giving is a prerequisite to spiritual responsibility.
[time=2225] If you're at Black Hawk Baptist Church and you're aspiring to leadership to be a deacon or an elder or there's some new ministry that you want to be involved in, beware that God is watching.
[time=2236] He is understanding your faithfulness with the unrighteous Mammon, and by that he doesn't mean that money is sinful.
[time=2243] It's just in comparison to the true spiritual riches.
[time=2247] If you can't handle the money, then I can't trust you with lives.
[time=2254] I knew a lot of guys when I was working at the Masters College and the Masters Seminary, who were aspiring to spiritual leadership and to be pastors of churches and heads of parachurch organizations and great vision.
[time=2265] They would always promise such great reform when they were to hold such a position, and they talk about their schedules changing, and their viewing habits changing, and their eating habits changing, and everything's going to change when I get there.
[time=2280] And you just quickly open the passage and say, "Wait a minute, be faithful right now in the little things, and even the things of your money and your budget."
[time=2289] And in so doing, qualify yourself to be entrusted with the true spiritual riches.
[time=2298] Principle number five, at the end of the book of Romans, Romans chapter 15, Romans chapter 15.
[time=2307] Again, the saints in Jerusalem are in view and Paul is raising money.
[time=2313] And he's describing the attitude out of which the Macedonian and the Akayans' saints gave their money.
[time=2321] Verse 25, Romans 15 verse 25.
[time=2327] But now I'm going to Jerusalem, serving the saints, Paul says, verse 26, for Macedonia and Akayah have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
[time=2337] Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them, for if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to minister to them also in material things.
[time=2348] In other words, these saints in Macedonia and Akayah, and hopefully the saints to whom this book, the book of Romans was written as Gentiles, would realize and remember that the gospel came first to the Jew and then to the Gentile, and it was through the sacrificial offerings of the church at Jerusalem
[time=2365] that supported these missionaries as they went out into these region areas, these surrounding areas in Macedonia and Akayah.
[time=2373] If it hadn't been for the church of Jerusalem, in other words, we wouldn't have had the gospel.
[time=2377] And now they're suffering in Jerusalem material needs, the least we can do is respond and give financial aid.
[time=2385] That's why it's so neat to hear people like the Haberlies give their testimony and others who have come up here and addressed us.
[time=2391] What you hear is, you know what, we have received enormous blessings from Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2397] There were some people that got saved before we did, and were in the process of giving sacrificially and generously and purposefully, and this church was here, and they had a pastor, and they had a building, and they had ministries and programs.
[time=2410] And we walked into it as unbelievers and got all this huge blessing.
[time=2414] And now it's our turn. Now it's our turn to anticipate and prepare for others to come who are yet to know Christ.
[time=2422] And when those people are invited by a friend of Blackhawk, we want to be sure that the house is in order, that the facilities are sufficient, that the ministries are running out of a sense of gratitude for those who had gone before us.
[time=2435] And so it just goes on, gratitude after gratitude, willingness to give and to be found faithful.
[time=2444] Another principle, principle number six at the end of 1 Corinthians, one book to the right, 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[time=2459] And the basic thing which Paul is teaching here is that giving is to be planned, giving is to be planned out, orderly, structured, as you purpose it in your own heart.
[time=2471] 1 Corinthians 16 verse 1, now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.
[time=2481] On the first day of every week, let each one of you put aside and save as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.
[time=2492] In other words, Paul is going to swing through there and bring their gift down to Jerusalem.
[time=2496] And he says you ought to be amassing this gift, this money on a regular weekly basis. What day of the week, the first day of the week, that's Sunday.
[time=2505] And we understand that our giving should happen on Sunday in our local church as a basic pattern, as an expression and continuation of our worship.
[time=2513] And so we come to worship and we're going to sing songs and we're going to enjoy each other's fellowship.
[time=2518] We're going to sit under the teaching of the Word of God and we're going to worship God by giving, by setting up in store the amount that we have set in our heart as God has prospered us.
[time=2528] We put it under the authority of Godly men on our elder board. I'm so thankful for the collection of men that sit on our board.
[time=2536] We were having a meeting just yesterday and in my heart I was just looking around the table thanking God for the level of spiritual maturity, the kind of involvement they have in our community.
[time=2545] We can trust these men, these men that you have elected, it's a blessing to be a part of that kind of process.
[time=2555] Giving should not be emotional or periodic emotional appeals and feelings but on a regular willingness to commit our possessions to the Lord, to His people and to His work.
[time=2567] And that really helps in a church like ours. We have a budget and we have all these vendors with whom we deal and our own payrolls.
[time=2574] And as you faithfully give on a regular basis, it allows us to honor those commitments and our testimony collectively is honored.
[time=2583] In looking at a video of Celebrate God's Grace back in 1986, I heard a testimony of one of our elders that I jotted down as he was just sharing a number of things but this one thing caught my mind.
[time=2596] He and his wife have always treated their weekly giving like their house payment.
[time=2601] Immediately I tuned right in, he said one because it's always one of the first checks written and two because they would never miss a payment because there was too much to lose.
[time=2612] Went on to say he loved his house and he loved his church. That puts it right in perspective.
[time=2618] Faithfully, regularly giving as a major priority in their financial scheme right up there with the house payment because of love.
[time=2628] Love for the shelter that God had provided them in their home where they could raise their godly family and love for this church where we could raise up God's godly family.
[time=2637] Regular consistent giving.
[time=2642] Principle number seven.
[time=2645] Let's go back to Matthew for a minute, Matthew chapter six.
[time=2648] And the last two principles that we'll share come from Matthew chapter six.
[time=2652] It is the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=2654] And Jesus is speaking about true righteousness.
[time=2659] True Christianity as opposed to an external legalistic ritualistic type of involvement with God.
[time=2666] Matthew chapter six verses 19, 20 and 21.
[time=2675] Giving channels the affections of your heart.
[time=2680] Read with me.
[time=2681] Verse 19.
[time=2682] Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
[time=2688] But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in or steal.
[time=2695] Here it is verse 21.
[time=2697] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[time=2706] Sometimes you'll give a cursory look at that verse and say, oh I get it.
[time=2710] If I want to know where my heart is, I just look where my treasure is.
[time=2714] And that is true, I mean the Bible teaches that, but that's not what this verse is saying.
[time=2718] This verse is saying the reverse.
[time=2720] If you're having trouble with your heart, if you're having trouble setting your heart on God.
[time=2725] And as you look in your own personal spiritual life and you're saying, man I wish I were more kingdom oriented.
[time=2731] I wish my affections were just more spontaneously and naturally set on the things of God.
[time=2736] And I wish I could move away from the external.
[time=2739] Sometimes you know how Christianity will slip into the externals and the ritual and you just kind of come into church.
[time=2745] Man where's my fire and where's my commitment and where is that stuff just coming right out from inside of me.
[time=2752] Well that's a difficult equation, but one of the factors in that equation is where you put your treasure.
[time=2758] And Jesus is saying if you'd like to direct your heart spontaneously and naturally then go through the process of taking your treasure and giving it to the Lord.
[time=2767] And your heart will follow.
[time=2771] For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.
[time=2779] Principle number eight, back of page in my Bible to Matthew chapter six verses one and following.
[time=2792] Matthew chapter six verses one and following.
[time=2797] Beware he says, beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them.
[time=2805] Now that's a classic symptom of people who aren't really in a vital relationship with God but are doing this whole thing as an external.
[time=2814] And what they're doing is being noticed by men.
[time=2819] Why the end of verse one otherwise you have no reward with your father who is in heaven.
[time=2825] Now that's kind of a thesis statement if you will for these next three examples about giving, prayer and fasting.
[time=2833] And we'll just look at the first one.
[time=2835] Giving, look at verse two.
[time=2837] When therefore you give alms, you give your money.
[time=2841] Do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may be honored by men.
[time=2848] Truly I say to you they have their reward and full.
[time=2852] In other words, if you're giving so that you can be honored by men when they honor you, when they notice you, that's it.
[time=2860] You've got it.
[time=2861] You've got all the return on your investment.
[time=2863] God is obligated to give you.
[time=2864] It's done.
[time=2865] There will be no more return on your investment than what you just got, the honor of men.
[time=2872] Verse three.
[time=2873] But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing that your alms may be in secret and your father who sees in secret will repay you.
[time=2885] And here the insidious character of sin is seen in what should be an act of sacrificial love as we give away our possessions.
[time=2896] The Lord knows that many times we do that so that we can be honored by men and really that is only just to puff up our own pride.
[time=2905] We want their approval so we can feel better about ourselves.
[time=2910] He says, don't do that.
[time=2911] In fact, not only don't let them know about it, but don't even know about it yourself.
[time=2916] Verse three, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, don't keep a spiritual ledger sheet in your mind about all the things that you've given to God.
[time=2927] Don't add that up.
[time=2929] Now, obviously in a practical sense, it's appropriate to add up because you need to make a report to the IRS and receive the benefits therein, and that's a legitimate thing to do.
[time=2939] But the spirit of this is don't keep a running tab throughout your life so that you can add up all that you've given and say, aren't I the great one?
[time=2947] Look at what I've done. Look at all I've given. Look all I'm doing without.
[time=2952] That's not the spirit of giving.
[time=2955] The spirit of giving is I have been given so much through the reality of Jesus Christ and salvation and the gospel, and I want to keep that work alive and advance the kingdom of God.
[time=2964] Take this and take this and take that and take that and it's not enough. It's all I can do. I wish I could do more.
[time=2971] All of that in secret.
[time=2976] Thinking about this verse I called up and spoke with Dale Johnson, our business administrator, I said, how do we keep it secret in our church?
[time=2982] Is it secret? He says, yeah, it's secret.
[time=2985] When you give in the offering plate, the money gets collected and it goes up into a room and there is a team of people there, a team of five or six folks.
[time=2993] And they're a part of our counting team and there are five of those teams and they rotate every single Sunday so that one group of people is never there in a row.
[time=3001] They don't show up again for five more Sundays so they can't even casually pick up a pattern anybody's giving.
[time=3007] And most of you give with a giving envelope and a number on there and all they do is very quickly take out the check and compare the amount on the check to the amount you've written on the outside of your giving envelope and the check's going a pile that eventually goes right down to Summit Bake on the same day and gets dropped in the night deposit.
[time=3022] And the record of your envelope and the thing they wrote down, your name is not there, the number and the amount goes up into our business office and they never see the name, they just see the amount and the giving number.
[time=3034] It's just totally separate.
[time=3036] And the only time that stuff comes together, a name and an amount is at the end of the year with your giving statements and that is held under strict this confidentiality and I have nowhere near that and neither is anybody else on the pastoral staff.
[time=3049] All that stuff is just handled very succinctly by some people in our office and you get sent your giving statement and if you happen to have a question, it does draw our attention, we answer the question and that's it and not we as in me.
[time=3060] I love being as far away from this stuff as I can possibly be.
[time=3064] I don't want to know that stuff.
[time=3066] Just talking to somebody about their BBL commitment and I handed them their card and I said you know something?
[time=3071] I am never going to know what you do with this card.
[time=3074] And I don't want to know.
[time=3075] And I don't know what you do with your weekly giving.
[time=3078] That would be the worst thing in the world for me to know.
[time=3081] That's between you and God and we have tried to develop a system even within our business department that minimizes to the very most any exposure of adding an amount to a name.
[time=3091] Because it's secret.
[time=3093] It's between you and your God.
[time=3097] So don't let other people know about it.
[time=3100] Don't keep a tally of your own, some spiritual ledger, some profit and loss account, some diary of all that you've given to God.
[time=3108] Why?
[time=3110] You don't need to keep an account because somebody else is.
[time=3113] His name is God.
[time=3115] Go to Matthew 25 just for a closing word.
[time=3118] This is so exciting to me.
[time=3120] We're here at the end of the age, the end of the tribulation.
[time=3123] It's the judgment of the sheep and the goats.
[time=3128] The Lord Jesus Christ is sitting as king and he's saying, "You sit on my right and inherit eternal life.
[time=3134] And you sit on my left and be cast into outer darkness." And here we realize that very specifically Jesus Christ is making a perfect record of everything you're giving, your time, your talent, your money, everything.
[time=3148] And He will repay you.
[time=3151] Verse 32, Matthew 25 verse 32, "All the nations will be gathered before Him and will separate them from one another as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
[time=3162] And He will put the sheep on His right and the goats on His left.
[time=3165] Then the king will say to those on His right, "Come, you who are blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
[time=3174] Now listen, "I was hungry and you gave me something to eat.
[time=3178] I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink.
[time=3181] I was a stranger and you invited me in naked and you clothed me sick and you visited me.
[time=3186] I was in prison and you came to me." Verse 37.
[time=3190] Then the righteous, these are the people that did all that stuff.
[time=3193] They say, "Lord, when did we see you hungry?
[time=3197] When were you thirsty?
[time=3199] When did we see you a stranger and invite you in and clothe you when you were naked?"
[time=3205] Verse 39.
[time=3206] "When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?" Verse 40.
[time=3211] "And the king will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of mine, even the least of them, you did it to me.'"
[time=3226] You know what that means?
[time=3228] Absolutely everything you are giving.
[time=3232] He's got it down.
[time=3234] And you know how you're going to return it?
[time=3237] Good measure.
[time=3238] Press down, shake them together, flowing over the top, load your garment up and haul off the goods.
[time=3247] Man, he is generous and we know that through the gift of his son.
[time=3254] How much should I give?
[time=3256] I can't tell you that.
[time=3258] Nobody can.
[time=3260] That's between you and your God.
[time=3263] Well, how do I think that through?
[time=3267] Well, I'll offer these eight principles.
[time=3269] Giving is to be sacrificial.
[time=3272] Giving is investing with God.
[time=3275] Giving is a matter of what you have, not what you wish you had.
[time=3279] Giving is a prerequisite to spiritual responsibility and authority.
[time=3285] Giving is to demonstrate love, not law.
[time=3289] Giving is to be planned.
[time=3292] Giving is a way to direct the affections of your heart.
[time=3296] And giving is to be done in secret.
[time=3302] You know, I'm so thankful that I get to be a part of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3308] You're a giving people.
[time=3310] You are a gracious people.
[time=3315] I look around and see the facilities and the ministries that are going on.
[time=3320] I went back and looked at some of the general broad annual giving amounts.
[time=3324] And I've watched you take your budget from 1970.
[time=3328] I think it was.
[time=3329] It was a budget of $30,000.
[time=3331] And we run in excess of a million dollars a year today.
[time=3334] You know that comes from you guys.
[time=3337] Because you love the Lord and you love this work and you love to see people come to Christ.
[time=3342] Man, it's a privilege.
[time=3344] It's a great privilege to be associated with you.
[time=3348] And we are encouraged and motivated and stimulated in our own hearts.
[time=3352] I'm talking about the Moore family to try to get on board with you guys and be givers like your givers.
[time=3358] And I don't know what God has in store for us.
[time=3360] I don't know where we're headed.
[time=3362] But I really believe that as we faithfully give, as we continue to sacrifice and let go of our material possessions,
[time=3372] that God will continue to use this church for his purposes.
[time=3375] And there's nothing more exciting.
[time=3377] There's nothing that can be any better than to be a part of that.
[time=3380] What would you stand with me as we close today?
